Corn ethanol is ethanol produced from corn biomass and is the main source of ethanol fuel in the United States. Corn ethanol is produced by ethanol fermentation and distillation. It is debatable whether the production and use of corn ethanol results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline. Approximately 25% of U.S. corn croplands are used for ethanol production.  Uses  Since 2001, corn ethanol production has increased by more than seven times. Out of 9.50 billions of bushels of corn produced in 2001, 0.71 billions of bushels were used to produce corn ethanol. Compared to 2018, out of 14.62 billions of bushels of corn produced, 5.60 billions of bushels were used to produce corn ethanol, reported by the United States Department of Energy. Overall, 95% of ethanol is produced from corn. Currently, corn ethanol is mainly used in blends with gasoline to create mixtures such as E10, E15, and E85. Ethanol is mixed into more than 98% of United States gasoline to reduce air pollution. Corn ethanol is used as an oxygenate when mixed with gasoline. E10 and E15 can be used in all engines without modification. However, blends like E85, with a much greater ethanol content, require significant modifications to be made before an engine can run on the mixture without damaging the engine. Some vehicles that currently use E85 fuel, also called flex fuel, include, the Ford Focus, Dodge Durango, and Toyota Tundra, among others. The future use of corn ethanol as a main gasoline replacement is unknown. Corn ethanol has yet to be proven to be as cost effective as gasoline due to corn ethanol being much more expensive to create compared to gasoline. Corn ethanol has to go through an extensive milling process before it can be used as a fuel source. One major drawback with corn ethanol, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROI), meaning the energy outputted in comparison to the energy required to output that energy. Compared to oil, with an 11:1 EROI, corn ethanol has a much lower EROI of 1.5:1, which, in turn, also provides less mileage per gallon compared to gasoline. In the future, as technology advances and oil becomes less abundant, the process of milling may require less energy, resulting in an EROI closer to that of oil. Another serious problem with corn ethanol as a replacement for gasoline, is the engine damage on standard vehicles. E10 contains ten percent ethanol and is acceptable for most vehicles on the road today, while E15 contains fifteen percent ethanol and is usually prohibited for cars built before 2001. However, with the hope to replace gasoline in the future, E85, which contains 85% ethanol, requires engine modification before an engine can last while processing a high volume of ethanol for an extended period of time. Therefore, most older and modern day vehicles would become obsolete without proper engine modifications to handle the increase in corrosiveness from the high volume of ethanol. Also, most gas stations do not offer refueling of E85 vehicles. The United States Department of Energy reports that only 3,355 gas stations, out of 168,000, across the United States, offer ethanol refueling for E85 vehicles. Production process An ethanol fuel plant in West Burlington, Iowa. There are two main types of corn ethanol production: dry milling and wet milling, which differ in the initial grain treatment method and co-products.  Dry milling  The vast majority (‚âà80%) of corn ethanol in the United States is produced by dry milling.Ethanol Production and Distribution, Alternative Fuels Data Center, US Dept of Energy In the dry milling process, the entire corn kernel is ground into flour, or \\"mash,\\" which is then slurried by adding water.Verser, D. W.; Eggeman, T. J. Process for producing ethanol from corn dry milling. US7888082B2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US7888082B2/en Enzymes are added to the mash to hydrolyze the starch into simple sugars. Ammonia is added to control the pH and as a nutrient for the yeast, which is added later. The mixture is processed at high-temperatures to reduce the bacteria levels. The mash is transferred and cooled in fermenters. Yeast are added, which ferment the sugars into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The entire process takes 40 to 50 hours, during which time the mash is kept cool and agitated to promote yeast activity. The ethanol is purified through a combination of distillation and dehydration to create fuel ethanol. The mash is then transferred to distillation columns, where the ethanol is removed from the stillage. The ethanol is dehydrated to about 200 proof using a molecular sieve system. A denaturant such as gasoline is added to render the product undrinkable. The product is then ready to ship to gasoline retailers or terminals. The remaining stillage is processed into a highly nutritious livestock feed known as distiller's dried grains and solubles (DDGS). The carbon dioxide released from the process is used to carbonate beverages and for dry ice manufacturing.  Wet milling  In wet milling, the corn grain is separated into components by steeping in dilute sulfuric acid for 24 to 48 hours. The slurry mix then goes through a series of grinders to separate out the corn germ. The remaining components of fiber, gluten, and starch are segregated using screen, hydroclonic, and centrifugal separators. The corn starch and remaining water can be fermented into ethanol through a similar process as dry milling, dried and sold as modified corn starch, or made into corn syrup. The gluten protein and steeping liquor are dried to make a corn gluten meal that is sold to the livestock industry. The heavy steep water is also sold as a feed ingredient and used as an alternative to salt in the winter months. Corn oil is also extracted and sold. Environmental issues Corn ethanol results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline and is fully biodegradable, unlike some fuel additives such as MTBE.Ethanol Myths and Facts However, because energy to run many U.S. distilleries comes mainly from coal plants, there has been considerable debate on the sustainability of corn ethanol in replacing fossil fuels. Additional controversy relates to the large amount of arable land required for crops and its impact on grain supply and direct and indirect land use change effects. Other issues relate to pollution, water use for irrigation and processing, energy balance, and emission intensity for the full life cycle of ethanol production. Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008. See Letters to Science by Wang and Haq. There are critics to these findings for assuming a worst-case scenario.Oxfam Briefing Paper 114, figure 2 pp.8 Originally published online in Science Express on 7 February 2008. There are rebuttals to these findings for assuming a worst-case scenario.Youngquist, W. Geodestinies, National Book company, Portland, OR, 499p.The dirty truth about biofuelsDeforestation diesel ‚Äì the madness of biofuel  Greenhouse gas emissions  Corn-processing plant near 400x400pxSeveral full life cycle studies have found that corn ethanol reduces well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50 percent compared to gasoline. Ethanol-blended fuels currently in the market ‚Äì whether E10 or E85 ‚Äì meet stringent tailpipe emission standards.  Croplands  One of the main controversies involving corn ethanol production is the necessity for arable cropland to grow the corn for ethanol, which is then not available to grow corn for human or animal consumption. In the United States, 40% of the acreage designated for corn grain is used for corn ethanol production, of which 25% was converted to ethanol after accounting for co-products, leaving only 60% of the crop yield for human or animal consumption.  Economic impact of corn ethanol  The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA), the ethanol industry's lobbying group, claims that ethanol production increases the price of corn by increasing demand. The RFA claims that ethanol production has positive economic effect for US farmers, but it does not elaborate on the effect for other populations where field corn is part of the staple diet. An RFA lobby document states that \\"In a January 2007 statement, the USDA Chief Economist stated that farm program payments were expected to be reduced by some $6 billion due to the higher value of a bushel of corn. Corn production in 2009 reached over 13.2 billion bushels, and a per acre yield jumped to over 165 bushels per acre. In the United States, 5.6 million bushels of corn were used for ethanol production out of 14.6 million bushels produced, according to preliminary 2018 USDA data. According to the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center, \\"The increased ethanol [production] seems to have come from the increase in overall corn production and a small decrease in corn used for animal feed and other residual uses. The amount of corn used for other uses, including human consumption, has stayed fairly consistent from year to year.\\" This does not prove there was not an impact on food supplies: Since U.S. corn production doubled (approximately) between 1987 and 2018, it is probable that some cropland previously used to grow other food crops is now used to grow corn. It is also possible or probable that some marginal land has been converted or returned to agricultural use. That may have negative environmental impacts. Alternative biomass for ethanol Remnants from food production such as corn stover could be used to produce ethanol instead of food corn. Ethanol derived from sugar-beet as used in Europe or sugar-cane in Brazil has up to 80% reduction in well-to-wheel carbon dioxide. The use of cellulosic biomass to produce ethanol is considered second generation biofuel that are considered by some to be a solution to the food versus fuel debate, and has the potential to cut life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 86 percent relative to gasoline.

Merkin Concert Hall hosts 70,000 concert goers a year. Overview Merkin Concert Hall opened in Kaufman Music Center's (then The Hebrew Art School's) Abraham Goodman House in 1978, and soon after distinguished itself as an important New York City venue, featuring innovative classical and new music programming (it is the recipient of three awards in Adventurous Programming by ASCAP/Chamber Music America).http://www.kaufmanmusiccenter.org/mch/ Merkin Concert Hall official site Located in the Lincoln Square neighborhood, it is near the Lincoln Center campus but is not affiliated with it. Merkin Hall hosts over 200 concerts a year, many of them Kaufman Music Center presentations. It has several long- running series, presenting established and emerging artists, as well as Broadway and Family focused shows. Beginning in 1986, Kaufman Music Center has co-presented New Sounds Live with WNYC, hosted by John Schaefer and broadcast live on the radio. In 2003, New York Festival of Song began its series of co- presentations at Merkin Hall as well. WQXR-FM's online webcast Q2 began live streaming of Kaufman Music Center's Ecstatic Music Festival in 2011. Renovations Kaufman Music Center launched a $17 million campaign to renovate the complex.

He served as the first abbot of the Trappist Abbey of Westmalle, where he founded the Westmalle Brewery. Early life He was born Frans Dani√´l Dom in Kontich, Flanders, then part of the Southern Netherlands, to Jan Frans Dom, a cattle merchant, and Elisabeth Van Berckelaer. He was baptised on Christmas Day 1791, the day after his birth, in the local parish church, the Church of St. Martin of Tours. As a young man Dom served as a fourrier in the Napoleonic Army. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1814, he returned home to everyday life. He became a notorious partygoer and became engaged to a young woman. But after some brawls at home with his father and with his life in turmoil, he decided to go on pilgrimage to the Church of Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van Goede Wil in Duffel to help him decide whether he should marry or enter the Trappist Monastery of Westmalle. The story goes that he let fate decide by throwing his hat up in the air. If it fell with the opening up he would go to Westmalle, but if it fell with the opening down he would ask for forgiveness and marry. The hat fell with the opening up and he went to enter the Trappists. At first the monks followed Trappist practice and strongly disparaged Dom's application, but on 11 November 1817, feast day of St. Martin of Tours, patron saint of both his hometown and of the monastery, he was received into the monastery and given the name Martinus. In 1818, he professed his religious vows and on 23 December 1820 he was ordained as a priest. He became one of the teachers of the orphan boys who were educated in the abbey. In 1826, when the monastery was made a semi-autonomous conventual priory by its motherhouse, the Abbey of La Trappe, he was elected prior of the monastery (the first to be elected), which position he retained until 1836 when he was elected abbot. Abbot In 1836 Westmalle Priory was raised to the status of an independent abbey by Pope Gregory XVI. On 14 July 1836, already prior of the monastery, Dom was elected as its first abbot of the abbey of Westmalle. When the priory obtained the status of an abbey, the strict rule that the monks could only drink water with their meal was relaxed. Cider or beer was then allowed to be drunk in the refectory of the abbey. Rather than buy beer from outside the abbey, Dom decided to brew their own beer. They started brewing on 1 August 1836, and on 10 December 1836 the monks tasted their own beer for the first time. Local sales began in 1856, and sales to traders commenced in 1921. Dom died at Westmalle on 9 December 1873, where he had been prior for 47 years and abbot for 37 years. Sources * Jan B.

In 2005, control of the event was taken by 12 local committees in Buea and representatives of the national Cameroon Athletics Federation (CAF) and the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education. The budget in 2007 was 130 million francs CFA, the bulk of which was provided by the Ministry of Sports and Physical Education. The change to public control was controversial: In 2005, Mayor Charles Mbella Moki of the Buea Rural Council accused the organisers of mismanagement and proposed that Guinness to be given back full control. In 2006, the CAF cut the prize money to the winners by 25% without warning, reportedly to cover their membership fees in the organisation.Nana & Mbunwe, \\"Winners Angry\\".

She joined her older sister, Annie Herring, and younger brother, Matthew Ward, to form the group which began singing together in 1970 and disbanded in 1988. Greisen then turned her attention to being a full-time mother to her two sons, and to supporting her husband, Steve Greisen, in his film business.Rewind: Second Chapter of Acts CCMmagazine.com Early years Nelly was born in North Dakota, the eighth of nine children born to Walter and Kathrine ‚ÄúElizabeth‚Äù Ward. Because of her mother‚Äôs deteriorating health, Nelly's family moved to Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento, California, when she was 7, to be closer to relatives and to obtain better medical care for her mother. Her mother died in 1968 as the result of an operation on a benign brain tumor. Her father died in 1970 of leukemia. Nelly was then 14 years old. When she was orphaned, Nelly and her younger brother, 12-year-old Matthew, went to live with their older sister, Annie Herring, and her new husband, disc jockey and audio engineer Buck Herring. Buck and Annie had been praying for her younger siblings for quite a while, so for the two children to come live with the couple was ‚Äúa foregone conclusion.\\" There was some conflict as the two families tried to merge. Career years Soon after Nelly and Matthew came to live with the Herrings, the three siblings began singing together. Annie usually sang lead, Matthew harmonized, and Nelly's rich alto voice found the missing notes between the two. Although she rarely sang lead, Greisen's harmonies tended to be more complicated than her brother‚Äôs. From time to time, Nelly would also add to the lyrics of the songs that Annie wrote. The three continued in these roles throughout their career as a music group, although they each also took a turn at singing lead during concerts. Some of the group‚Äôs best loved songs, including\\"Something Tells Me\\", ‚ÄúMountain Tops‚Äù, \\"Which Way The Wind Blows\\", ‚ÄúMake My Life a Prayer to You‚Äù, \\"Sing Over Me\\", \\"Takin The Easy Way\\", \\"My Jesus I Love Thee\\" were performed with Greisen singing lead. Nelly was also featured as a background singer on dozens of recordings during the '70,'80 and '90's. One of Greisen's special roles in the group was to speak out during a concert when she sensed that the Lord was healing a certain type of illness, or that He was touching people in a certain way. Sometimes people would approach her after a concert and tell her that the Lord had healed them. Sometimes no one would testify to the fact that they had been healed, although they might tell her about it years after their healing. Personal life In the summer of 1975, she met Steve Greisen, a young singer whose band had been touring Europe for a number of years. They started dating and later Steve's band \\"The Family\\" along with 2nd Chapter of Acts joined the Jesus Music musical \\"If My People\\" that toured the country in 1976. They were married in 1978. Later, two sons, Andrew and Jesse, were born to the Greisens. They moved from California to Texas in 1981, and later to Monument, Colorado in 1993. Nelly has never embarked on a solo musical career. Instead, she supports her husband's film production (reelproductions.net) and film distribution business Exploration Films (explorationfilms.com). They currently live in the mountains of Colorado. Nelly remains active on boards of non-profit organizations, volunteering, pursuing her new love of oil painting, loves scuba diving and fitness and of course connecting with her adult sons who live nearby and occasionally singing locally.

Early life and career O'Farrell was born in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, and grew up in Wales and Scotland. At the age of eight, she was hospitalised with encephalitis and missed over a year of school. These events are echoed in The Distance Between Us, and described in her 2017 memoir I Am, I Am, I Am. She was educated at North Berwick High School, Brynteg Comprehensive School and New Hall, Cambridge (now Murray Edwards College), where she read English Literature. O'Farrell has stated that, well into the 1990s, being Irish in Britain could be fraught: \\"We used to get endless Irish jokes, even from teachers. If I had to spell my name at school, teachers would say things like, 'Oh, are your family in the IRA?‚Äô Teachers would say this to a 12-year-old kid in front of the whole class\\". \\"They thought it was hilarious to say, 'Ha ha, your dad‚Äôs a terrorist'. It wasn't funny at all\\". \\"I wish I could say that it‚Äôs [less common today] because people are less racist, but I think it‚Äôs just that there are new immigrants who are getting it now\\". Nevertheless, not until 2013's Instructions for a Heatwave did Irish subjects become a part of her work. O'Farrell worked as a journalist, both in Hong Kong and as the deputy literary editor of The Independent on Sunday. She also taught creative writing at the University of Warwick in Coventry and Goldsmith's College in London. Books O'Farrell has written numerous successful novels, including the Costa-Award-winning The Hand that First Held Mine, and received widespread critical acclaim for all her books. Her work has been translated into over 30 languages. Her novel based around Shakespeare's family, Hamnet, was published in 2020. In 2011 she contributed the short story \\"How the Oak Tree Came to Life\\" to Why the Willow Weeps, an anthology sold to fund the work of the Woodland Trust, which planted five trees for each copy sold. Her 2017 memoir I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen brushes with Death deals with a series of near-death experiences that affected her and her children. Personal life O'Farrell is married to fellow novelist William Sutcliffe, whom she met while they were students at Cambridge. They live in Edinburgh with their three children. She has described Sutcliffe as \\"a huge influence\\", saying, \\"Will's always been my first reader, even before we were a couple, so he's a huge influence. He's brutal but you need that\\".

Particularly in the 1930s Ulrich R√ºck succeeded in expanding the collection considerably. Shortly before his death he bequeathed the collection containing approximately 1500 items to the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg. After World War II this was undoubtedly the largest and most important private collection of historical musical instruments in Europe and R√ºck saw himself as patron of a new area of performance using examples of such historical instruments. He cooperated with music scholars from all corners of Europe and maintained contacts with restorers, most notably Otto Marx of the Heyer collection in Cologne and Leipzig. Amongst R√ºck's most important projects was the work to restore to playability Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's fortepiano in the possession of the Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1937.

Hector Boece claims that he was the nephew of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, but no contemporary evidence supports this.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 108; Reid, \\"Cheyne , Henry (died 1328)\\". Cheyne belonged to a family with Norman roots which was well established in the northeast of Scotland, holding significant amounts of territory on the boundaries of the Earldom of Buchan.Reid, \\"Cheyne , Henry (died 1328)\\". Life Henry emerges for the first time - as Precentor of Aberdeen Cathedral - when his name occurs in a document dated to 22 January 1277.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 9. Despite the fact he was only a deacon, after the death of the former bishop, Hugh de Benin, the chapter unanimously elected le Chen to be the new Bishop of Aberdeen.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 108. Pope Martin IV originally cancelled the election because le Chen had not been yet ordained a priest, but reversed his decision and commissioned Robert Wishart, Alan de St Edmund and William, the bishops of Glasgow, Caithness and Dunblane respectively, to consecrate le Chen after one of them had ordained him a priest. Le Chen's strong Comyn connections meant that, in the succession dispute which followed the deaths of Alexander III of Scotland and Margaret, Maid of Norway, he firmly supported the Comyn-backed claims of John Balliol; he was one of the auditors employed by Balliol during the Great Cause. Although one of the senior royal councillors during the reign of King John Balliol, when King Edward I of England invaded and deposed King John, le Chen quickly swore an oath of fealty to Edward, and was so well trusted by the King that the latter put him in charge of the sheriffdom of Aberdeen. In the period immediately following the uprising and restoration of the throne by Robert de Brus (Robert the Bruce), Earl of Carrick, in 1306, le Chen was noticeably lukewarm to the new king (now Robert I of Scotland), and at some point was temporarily deprived of the temporalities of his see, though there is no direct evidence that he suffered exile.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 108; Reid, \\"Cheyne , Henry (d. 1328)\\". In 1309 he attended Robert's first parliament and was part of the renewal of the Treaty of Perth in 1312, but Bishop Henry nevertheless held a low profile for the remainder of the decade.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 108-9; Reid, \\"Cheyne , Henry (d. 1328)\\". However, despite the complete success of the Bruce cause, no other bishop is found to be promoted, and le Chen was a loyal subject of the king by the end of the decade when he was summoned to the papal curia (16 August 1320) to account for the behaviour of his king.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 109; Reid, \\"Cheyne , Henry (d. 1328)\\". On 16 June 1321, Pope John XXII excommunicated Bishop Henry, and on 23 May 1322, commanded the bishops of Winchester and Dunblane to promulgate the sentence.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 108-9. John died at an unknown date in 1329, the same year as King Robert.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 109; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 110; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 2.

It is located approximately 80 kilometers south-west of Lahore. It was once the largest man-made forest in the world but has undergone illegal deforestation at a massive scale in recent times. Changa Manga is known more widely as \\"one of the oldest hand-planted forests in the world\\", and hosts a wide variety of flora and fauna. The forest is home to 14 species of mammals, 50 species of birds, six species of reptiles, two species of amphibians and 27 species of insects. Thus, other than producing timber for the local industry, the forest also serves as an important wildlife reserve. Named after two brother dacoits, the Changa Manga forest was originally planted in 1866 by British foresters. Its trees were harvested to gather fuel and resources for the engines employed in the North-Western railway networks. Onomatology of name The name of the forest is derived from an amalgamation of the names of two brother dacoits (bandits), Changa and Manga. The dacoits were a constant source of terror for the \\"law-abiding citizens\\" of the districts in the 19th century as they would \\"hold up and plunder\\" any passing trader. The robbers had a den in the \\"secret heart\\" of the forest where they sought shelter from the British peacekeepers. The robbers were eventually captured by the police and became the inspiration for the name of the forest site. Soon afterwards, Salvation Army opened up a camp at the forest site as a place for reformation of criminals. Location The Changa Manga forest can be entered from a road off the N-5 Highway near Bhai Pheru and Chunian. At present, the forest covers an area of . It was once the largest man-made forest in the world but massive deforestation has reduced it to less than half its original size. It is also known as \\"one of the oldest hand-planted forests in the world\\". The forest plantation dates back to 1866 and was planned to fill the need for timber and fuel resources for the North- Western railway networks. The most common species of flora are Dalbergia sissoo (Sheesham) and Acacia nilotica (Kikar), both members of the Fabaceae and native to the Indian subcontinent. Morus alba (white mulberry) was also introduced to the plantation and became popular in cultivation throughout South Asia. The forest also has several species of Eucalyptus and Populus. History=Allocation of land slashed and burnt to make way for an irrigated plain on which to cultivate the forest plantations. In 1864, the North-Western Railway found itself starved of resources, vital in running services on its network. It was then that Dr John Lindsay Stewart, the first Conservator of Forests of Punjab, recommended the allocation of a block of land for each railway district where forest plantations should be cultivated to cater for such growing demands. Such a block of land was allocated for the Kasur district at the Chunian tehsil on the Lahore-Karachi railway line. This land was allocated on the assumption that 4850 cubic feet per acre of mature crop on a 15-year rotation would adequately suffice the five trains running daily on these lines, consuming of fuel per train. This particular area of land was a semi-desert scrub jungle with thorn forest land and a light alluvial soil that only required the introduction of water to yield crops. The land was mostly populated by the Gondhal and Sansi gypsies, whom British called ‚Äújunglies‚Äù (a derogatory term meaning ‚Äòjungle-dwelling barbarians‚Äô). The British replaced the population of the Gondhals and Sansis with an influx of cultivators from older cultivated lands and other provinces. In preparation for cultivation, the land was slashed and burnt to rid the landscape of thorn forest and dry scrub growth. The unruly scrubs of the dry jungles were gradually turned into plains ready for irrigation. Initial plantation Within the premises of the allocated land, the German forester Berthold Ribbentrop, Inspector General of Forests in British India, identified a dry forest area where long rooted bar trees could exist. He planned to cultivate the land with the plantation of Morus alba (white mulberry) and Dalbergia sissoo (sheesham). The plantation of the forest began in 1866 but failed to obtain substantial harvest from the initial wooded area of . In 1868, Charles Frederick Amery, an officer in the Indian Forestry Commission, had an idea of employing a trench and ridge system. Ribbentrop adopted the system making the plantation a \\"sylvicultural and financial success\\". The plantation reaped its first successful harvest in 1888 from a second crop rotation. The site was soon identified as a sustainable source for timber, primarily serving the North-Western railway network. Railway and logistics By 1870, the irrigated plantation had grown to and was served by the primary railway station for the Chunian tehsil on the Lahore-Karachi railway line. To benefit logistics for logging operations, it was decided to build a railway station at Changa Manga. A special gauge railway, called the Changa Manga Forestry Railway, was established for narrow gauge logging operations. The railway employed the use of wood-burning steam locomotives built by John Fowler & Co., of Leeds. When burning wood from an engine set fire to a van and buggy, the locomotives were upgraded to coal-powered types. Even with such incidents, the demand for wood from Changa Manga remained steady as its supply base grew across the timber market in India. The railway is still operational today and is only used to either transport timber or haul tourists on special occasions. Amongst the three engines, operational to date, are two from John Fowler & Co. and one from Andrew Barclay Sons & Co. of Kilmarnock, Scotland. Great Indian Famine of 1876‚Äì78 The years 1876‚Äì78 saw intense drought sweep across much of India, and in particular the Deccan Plateau. The famine was a result of crop failures throughout the plateau. The failure to provide food to the millions of hungry countrymen during the famine was blamed primarily on the absence of adequate rail infrastructure and thus the British administration sought to expand its rail infrastructure. Though some parts of Punjab were also affected by the famine, firewood from Changa Manga grew in demand to supply the growing network of rail infrastructure. Salvation Army Silk Camp The early 1900s saw many Indian traders invest in the silk trade. Most of the silk in India came from silkworms cultivated at Moradabad near Delhi. However, businessmen deemed the Delhi silk as \\"lacking lustre\\" and they ventured into silk experiments elsewhere across the country. One such silk experiment was conducted by Commissioner Frederick Booth-Tucker of The Salvation Army at Changa Manga in 1912. It came to be known as the Salvation Army Silk Camp. Booth-Tucker brought along hundred ounces of silkworm eggs (about 3 million eggs) from France. To house the worms, he created long sheds from bamboo and dried grass. The worms‚Äô feed consisted entirely of mulberry leaves obtained from felled trees in the forest. The worms fed on 70 hundredweights of leaves a day. In 1916, the Governor of Punjab Sir Michael O'Dwyer visited the silk experiment where the silkworms had started developing cocoons. The governor left pleased with Booth-Tucker‚Äôs work. The Salvation Army Silk Camp remained a sustainable venture for a year after the governor‚Äôs visit, although changes to the climate later led to its decline. Wildlife conservation and breeding Gyps bengalensis (white-rumped vultures) which are a critically endangered species of Asiatic vultures. The forest serves as a conservation and breeding centre for the critically endangered species of Asiatic vultures, Gyps bengalensis (white-rumped vultures). It hosts a conservation centre in association with WWF SAVE (Saving Asia's Vultures from Extinction) programme, an international effort across India, Nepal and Pakistan. The Asiatic vulture species of G. bengalensis and G. indicus have reportedly seen a decline by \\"more than 90 per cent in Pakistan, India and Nepal\\", thereby making the conservation efforts at Changa Manga extremely crucial for the survival of these vulture species. Gyps Vulture Conservation Centre There is a Vulture Conservation Centre in a secluded area of the Changa Manga forest. The centre has been specifically designed to manage the population of G. bengalensis. The centre operates the Gyps Vulture Restoration Programme under the management of WWF Pakistan and the Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department, with aid of the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, Hawk Conservancy Trust and WWF USA. The vulture conservation programme was first realised in 2004 and this dedicated conservation centre became fully operational in 2007. The centre holds up to fifteen G. benalgensis in its communal aviary, but has a capacity to hold 30 vultures in its four separate breeding aviaries. The communal aviary is 38m long and increases in width from 14m to 27.5m. The aviary contains live tree perches with roosting and nesting ledges, which also provides shade and shelter for birds. Wildlife reserve Changa Manga also has a wildlife reserve that covers an area of , built in 2008. The reserve is home to species of hog deer, Indian peafowl, golden jackal, mouflon, nilgai and wild boar. The Changa Manga wildlife preserve is one of the three wildlife parks located in the Lahore Division, other two being Jallo Wildlife Park and Lahore Zoo Safari. Recreation Parts of the forest have now been developed into a recreation park with a railroad that gives the visitor a ride on a miniature train through the forest. Other attractions include a water turbine, a waterfall, a children‚Äôs play area, and a lake called 'Lunar Lake', where boating is possible. Changa Manga Tourist Resort is situated from Lahore city. The Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab (TDCP) arranges picnic trips to Changa Manga throughout the year. Deforestation The world‚Äôs largest artificial forest is being heavily logged, and so far more than 60 percent of Changa Manga Wildlife Park has been deforested. Revival of Changa Manga Forest On 11 November 2011, Khan Waqas A. Khan broke the story of rapid deforestation in Changa Mhanga Forest and exposed how unbridled wood mafia of with the forest officials are rapidly deforesting the world's largest man-made forest. The Chief Ombudsman, Punjabi, Javed Mehboob took a suo moto notice to probe the case and report accordingly. A series of news stories were then filed by Khan until 24 June 2012, when CM Punjab Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, taking notice of the situation, ordered the removal of Chief Conservator (Forest) Dr Mehboobur Rehman and Conservator (Forest) Rao Khalid from their posts and making them OSD. The chief minister also ordered the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment DG and the CM Inspection Team (CMIT) chairman to carry out a joint investigation into the deforestation by timber mafia and ferret out facts about their possible links with the forest authorities. The CM also ordered to begin from terrorist Pakistaninvestigation into the issue from 1990 onward. The team had been directed to investigate all the DFOs, posted at Changa Manga since 1990. Similarly the team had been directed to investigates all SDOYs, Block Officers and Forest Guards who have been working there since then and the culprits were then arrested and reported to police. Howevers, all of them got bail from the courts, were evicted from charges or received minor penalties. The Ombudsman issued a detailed report on the case affixing para wise responsibilities on those who were responsible for the worst affairs and CMIT proceeded for criminalized proceedings for the sake, but everything went under they blanket and now almost all of the accused are workington on the similar posts as ADHOC. The pulpits was to appoint them on these same posts as contract/daily wage/ adhoc employees while they are still OSD, dismissed form service unofficially. Apart from this, however serious efforts the government somehow started to bring back Changa Manga to the listed of worlds ‚Äôs largest artificially forests. Change Manganese Forester was then safely be termed as back to track. Water scarcity was the first reason of plant disease and failure. The forest administration negotiated with the irritating department and took fullest sanctioned discharge of 113 cusecs for the forest for all seasons. This step alone brought very positive results and the forest grew greenhouse again. Illegal animals were another source of forest destruction. There were mafias that used to use this Forester as the grazing safari and hence all new plantation failed because of abundant illegal grazing. 864 Animals in this period were ejected from the forest on self-help basis as legislation for the same is still pending although a summary has been approved by the CM in this regard already. To tackle the political and social mafias, the current administration kept a close liaison with the Chunian Cantt authorities who deployed army patrolling teams in the forest to help forest staff control the damage, illicit grazing and snubbing of notoriously habitual offenders. Two row boundary planting of large sized plants along the 39 kms foundry of the plantation including improvement of boundary road for patrolling has been completed. Barbed wire fencing of 30 km along with the RCC posts on the boundary of the forest to check illegal movement has been completed. Planting of 9 km large sized fundamental plants along tram line for aesthetic view of the visitors has been completed. Construction of main gates on the boundary of plantation to stop illegal movement has been completed. Reconstruction of boundary wall with iron grill around forest park to secure 5000 Rft park area and 7050 Rft on the Wankhara side has been completed as well . Additionally, afforestation of new plants were done in 1500 acre blank area. It is pertinent to mention that an additional 4000 acres is still pending afforestation that is respected to be started by next year. However, 150000 poplar plants have been recently planted on the road sides to give the forest a better look. In the same period 52 FIRs have been registered, however most of them are still pending investigation as the accused are, either themselves or family members of, prominent political figures of area including Ch Mehmood Anwar and Rana Muhammad Ishaq Khan blending to ruling party of Punjab. Changa Manga has long been waiting for all this. Now when things are back on track; it shall be expected that the authorities will not turn a blind eye towards affairs and will help forest administration in preventing culprits from further destroying the forest. Similarly, it is also recommended that encouragement rewards may be given to the current administration for doing honest efforts to save the forest. According to Forest Department officials in April 2020, honey sales from Changa Manga wildlife preserve increased from Rs. 729,000 in the 2016-17 financial year to Rs. 1.3 million in the 2019-2020 financial year. This is asserted to be due to increased honeybee presence at the preserve as a result of Billion Tree Project afforestation efforts and decreased use of pesticides and industrial fertilizers in the vicinity of the region.

She was known for her great beauty, as was her brother Aristobulus III. Herod's fear of his rivals, the Hasmoneans, led him to execute all of the prominent members of the family, including Mariamne. Her name is spelled ŒúŒ±œÅŒπŒ¨ŒºŒ∑ (Mariame) by Josephus, but in some editions of his work the second m is doubled (Mariamme). In later copies of those editions the spelling was dissimilated to its now most common form, Mariamne. In Hebrew, Mariamne is known as , (Miriam), as in the traditional, Biblical name (see Miriam, the sister of Moses and Aaron). Family Mariamne was the daughter of the Hasmonean Alexandros, also known as Alexander of Judaea, and thus one of the last heirs to the Hasmonean dynasty of Judea.Josephus records a daughter of Antigonus, the last Hasmonean king, was married to Antipater III and with him during his trial before Varus in 5 BCE. See Antiquities, Book XVII, Chapter 5:2 Mariamne's only sibling was Aristobulus III. Her father, Alexander of Judaea, the son of Aristobulus II, married his cousin Alexandra, daughter of his uncle Hyrcanus II, in order to cement the line of inheritance from Hyrcanus and Aristobulus, but the inheritance soon continued the blood feud of previous generations, and eventually led to the downfall of the Hasmonean line. By virtue of her parents' union, Mariamne claimed Hasmonean royalty on both sides of her family lineage. Her mother, Alexandra, arranged for her betrothal to Herod in 41 BCE after Herod agreed to a Ketubah with Mariamne's parents. The two were wed four years later (37 BCE) in Samaria. Mariamne bore Herod four children: two sons, Alexandros and Aristobulus (both executed in 7 BCE), and two daughters, Salampsio and Cypros. A fifth child (male), drowned at a young age ‚Äì likely in the Pontine Marshes near Rome, after Herod's sons had been sent to receive educations in Rome in 20 BCE. Josephus writes that it was because of Mariamne's vehement insistence that Herod made her brother Aristobulos a High Priest. Aristobulos, who was not even eighteen years old, drowned (in 36 BCE) within a year of his appointment; Alexandra, his mother, blamed Herod. Alexandra wrote to Cleopatra, begging her assistance in avenging the boy's murder. Cleopatra in turn urged Mark Antony to punish Herod for the crime, and Antony sent for him to make his defense. Herod left his young wife in the care of his uncle Joseph, along with the instructions that if Antony should kill him, Joseph should kill Mariamne. Herod believed his wife to be so beautiful that she would become engaged to another man after his death and that his great passion for Mariamne prevented him from enduring a separation from her, even in death. Joseph became familiar with the queen and eventually divulged this information to her and the other women of the household, which did not have the hoped-for effect of proving Herod's devotion to his wife. Rumors soon circulated that Herod had been killed by Antony, and Alexandra persuaded Joseph to take Mariamne and her to the Roman legions for protection. However, Herod was released by Antony and returned home, only to be informed of Alexandra's plan by his mother and sister, Salome. Salome also accused Mariamne of committing adultery with Joseph, a charge which Herod initially dismissed after discussing it with his wife. After Herod forgave her, Mariamne inquired about the order given to Joseph to kill her should Herod be killed, and Herod then became convinced of her infidelity, saying that Joseph would only have confided that to her were the two of them intimate. He gave orders for Joseph to be executed and for Alexandra to be confined, but Herod did not punish his wife. Because of this conflict between Mariamne and Salome, when Herod visited Augustus in Rhodes in 31 BCE, he separated the women. He left his sister and his sons in Masada while he moved his wife and mother-in-law to Alexandrium. Again, Herod left instructions that should he die, the charge of the government was to be left to Salome and his sons, and Mariamne and her mother were to be killed. Mariamne and Alexandra were left in the charge of another man named Sohemus, and after gaining his trust again learned of the instructions Herod provided should harm befall him. Mariamne became convinced that Herod did not truly love her and resented that he would not let her survive him. When Herod returned home, Mariamne treated him coldly and did not conceal her hatred for him. Salome and her mother preyed on this opportunity, feeding Herod false information to fuel his dislike. Herod still favored her; but she refused to have sexual relations with him and accused him of killing her grandfather, Hyrcanus II, and her brother. Salome insinuated that Mariamne planned to poison Herod, and Herod had Mariamne's favorite eunuch tortured to learn more. The eunuch knew nothing of a plot to poison the king, but confessed the only thing he did know: that Mariamne was dissatisfied with the king because of the orders given to Sohemus. Outraged, Herod called for the immediate execution of Sohemus, but permitted Mariamne to stand trial for the alleged murder plot. To gain favor with Herod, Mariamne's mother even implied Mariamne was plotting to commit l√®se majest√©. Mariamne was ultimately convicted and executed in 29 BCE.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities 15.7.4‚Äì6. Herod grieved for her for many months.

When the whole house of the Hasmoneans had been rooted out, she threw herself from a roof and was killed. She committed suicide because Herod had spared her life, so that he could marry her.

It is long through difficult country, with 24 tunnels, 91 bridgeshttp://thisnzlife.co.nz/exploring-forgotten-highways-stratford- okahukura-railway-line/ and a number of sections of 1 in 50 grade.See Alexander, R. B., \\"The Stratford-Okahukura Line,\\" at pp. 8-22 for a detailed description of the difficult construction (2nd revised edition, 1983, New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society). Near Okahukura there is an unusual combined road-rail bridge over the Ongarue River, with the one-lane road carriageway below the single rail track.Google Streetview showing combined road and rail bridge The line is not currently in service for rail traffic and is under a 30-year lease for a tourist venture. In July 2019 KiwiRail's CEO stated that reopening the line was a priority. Construction= Original Construction  The line from Stratford to Whangam≈çmona (of about 48 miles) was authorised by the Railways Authorisation Act, 1900 The Hon William Hall- Jones turned the first sod of the Stratford-Kawakawa Railway at Stratford on 28 March 1901. Kawakawa, south of Ongarue, was to be the junction point with the North Island Main Trunk Line. Construction took nearly 32 years, and the western part, from Stratford, was operated as the Toko Branch from 9 August 1902. The SOL was nearly complete before the onset of the Great Depression, so work was not halted, unlike on many public works projects such as the East Coast Main Trunk Railway beyond Taneatua. The section from Okahukura to Matiere was officially opened on Tuesday 23 May 1922, although the bridges to the west of Tuhua were temporary rather than the final and stronger structures. At the opening ceremony, the Minister for Public Works, the Hon Gordon Coates (subsequently Prime Minister, 1925-1928) said the cost of building that segment of the line was ¬£33,000 per mile.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220524.2.85 NZ Herald, 24 May 1922 At the same time, a separate report indicates that the track had been laid from Stratford for 47 miles (76 km) up to Tahora, leaving a 31-mile (50 km) gap between Tahora and Matiere.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19220523.2.65 Auckland Star 23 May 1922 The Mayor of Stratford celebrated the piercing of the last tunnel ( No.4 Mangatiti) on 2 August 1932 and, on 7 November 1932, the last spike was driven at Heao by the Prime Minister, the Right Hon. George Forbes, with Rt. Hon. Gordon Coates driving the first train. Goods traffic started on 12 December 1932, though the SOL was not handed over by the Public Works Department to the New Zealand Railways Department until 3 September 1933.  Signalling  The line was unsignalled and worked under \\"open section working\\" when two trains collided at the northern portal to the Whangamomona Tunnel on 21 December 1934; Train No 521 was due to cross with No 556 at Pohokura but departed without the guard as the engine crew claimed they saw his arm horizontal at the rear of the train indicating the train was to proceed; the crews were fortunate that they did not collide in the tunnel. Although generally understood to have trains operating, especially in the later years, on a warrant control basis, mention is made in the 1939 Railways Report to Parliament of the completion of automatic single-line signalling on the line. The final section was from Whangam≈çmona to Okahukura, in those days a distance of 51 miles 52 chains (i.e. 83.1 km) and consistent with modern distance measurements.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/parliamentary/AJHR1940-I.2.2.3.2/2 See page 27 and 30  1950s Upgrades and Maintenance  Upgrades and maintenance to the track were undertaken in 1959‚Äì60. Some of the track was replaced with 75 lbs/yd rail that at some point was made into a continuously welded rail.https://taic.org.nz/sites/default/files/inquiry/documents/07-115%20V%20FINAL.pdf See Page 2  Crossing Loops  Crossing loops were established at Te Wera, Whangam≈çmona, Tangarakau and Ohura. Three stations (Te Wera, Whangamomona and Ohura) had stationmasters. The short loops meant that long trains had to be split to fit into the loop and siding. Operation= Passenger services  Okahakura Road Rail Bridge The SOL was initially served by the New Plymouth Night Express between New Plymouth and Auckland and by Stratford‚ÄìTaumarunui passenger trains. When the line opened, it was reported that overnight express trains between Auckland and New Plymouth could now complete the journey in less than 12 hours.https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19330906.2.132 NZ Herald 6 September 1933 Whangam≈çmona had refreshment rooms from 1933 to 1965. Fiat or \\"88 seater\\" railcars replaced the Auckland-New Plymouth express trains from 1956, but were cut back to New Plymouth-Taumarunui in 1971. Mixed trains were withdrawn in 1975. Scheduled passenger trains ceased in January 1983 as roads in the rugged and isolated northern Taranaki were improved and passengers switched to cars, though the line was not closed to all passenger trains until January 2007, after an excursion to Whangam≈çmona's \\"Republic Day\\" celebrations. This terminated the operation of excursions, but efforts were made to have the line upgraded to a standard where excursions will again be possible.Lyn Humphreys, \\"Train ban may derail $100 million film\\", Taranaki Daily News, 23 March 2007 A working party of stakeholders was formed in June 2007 to investigate the current state of the line and to develop a case for upgrading it.Author unknown, \\"Rail Revival Plans\\", Taranaki Daily News, 11 June 2007. Considerable maintenance was required to bring the line up to safety standards required for passenger trains at a cost of approximately NZ$6 million to complete, according to Stratford Mayor Brian Jeffares.Richard Wood, \\"Fight looms to keep rail line open\\", Taranaki Daily News, 14 June 2007.  Freight services  Most freight was for the rural hinterland, but along the SOL there were coal mines near Ohura and Tangarakau, and also sawmills. One freight train operated each weeknight each way along the line carrying freight between New Plymouth and Auckland, interchanging at Taumarunui.Toll Rail timetable In recent years the deferred maintenance issues meant these services operated under heavy speed restrictions. The SOL was upgraded in 1959‚Äì60, and a deviation and a new station building built at Stratford. In conjunction with the Marton - New Plymouth Line the SOL also provided an alternative route when the North Island Main Trunk was closed between Marton and Taumarunui. In 1953 the Tangiwai disaster closed the NIMT for a period.  Mothballing  The SOL suffered from a lack of investment and maintenance, leading to a number of speed restrictions being put in place. In July 2002 a fatal derailment occurred at Te Wera, and a number of other incidents also plagued operations. In November 2009 a serious partial derailment of a wagon occurred, damaging some 8 km of line preventing use by trains without repairs. KiwiRail describes the damage as covering 9.5 km of track.http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/news/25/15/Stratford-Okahukura-Line-to-remain- moth-balled.html Following this KiwiRail decided to mothball the 144 km line, with rail freight now being routed through Palmerston North. However, ideas for preserving the line emerged with hopes that customers and investment could be found to return the line to full service. Adventure tourism operator Forgotten World Adventures reached agreement with KiwiRail in 2012 to lease the line for their new venture using modified petrol rail carts for tourists to travel between the line's termini at Stratford and Okahukura, via a number of trip options, starting from Labour Weekend 2012. The 30-year lease makes the company responsible for the line's maintenance and access control but allows KiwiRail to use the line in emergencies and to resume control of the line depending on future circumstances and opportunities. The rail bridge over State Highway 4 at Okahukura has been removed making the track between the easternmost tunnel and Okahukura unusable. In 2019 the Rail & Maritime Transport Union revealed that a review of the line is being undertaken to assess the viability of reopening for \\"Fonterra and log traffic.\\" In July KiwiRail CEO Greg Miller stated that a $40 million project to reopen the line was a priority.

History  On April 15, 1907, the Gustav-Stresemann commercial school was found as a high school. In 1909, the school was extended into a one-year commercial elementary school for boys. In 1922, the school was established at the ‚ÄúDomus University‚Äù as a two-year school. Between 1944 and 47, caused by the war and the destruction of a schoolbuilding after a bombing raid, the school closed for 3 years. On April 15, 1947, the school reopened in a different location with the principal Dr. D√∂rr. In 1952-55 the school was headed by Dr. J.Kloster, followed in 1955 by Mr. Steglich. In 1958 the school moved to the Zitadelle Mainz. At the citadel the school occupied two small buildings. The citadel had direct access to the train station. During that time some later successful pupils attended classes, like Karl-Heinz Kipp, the ‚ÄúMassa‚Äù founder of the ‚ÄúBakery Ditsch‚Äù, Peter Ditsch.

Her successor was G√ºnter Mattis. 2004-2013 Ibolya Havel-Scheuermann. In 1979/80 the Gustav-Stresemann commercial school reorganised to also provide language skills. 1999 Gustav-Stresemann school moved out of the citadel compound into a former IBM building. In 2002/03 a basic business training school was added, providing classes to apprentices. Finally in 2007, a total of 855 pupils and 80 teachers constitute ‚ÄúGSW‚Äù Business oriented grammar school The objective of the business oriented grammar school is to get the university entrance and learning about business subjects. The attendance of the course takes usually 3 years. Requirements To enter the business oriented grammar school one must have the secondary school qualification or an equivalent qualification with a grade average of 3.0. The main subjects German, English, and Mathematics have to be ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù means grade 4 or better. A pupil who has acquired the qualification of the business oriented secondary school specified in foreign languages and has finished this course with a ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù grade or better, can be taken up without attendance of the introductory year 11, immediately to the 12th class (12/1) of the business oriented grammar school. Characteristics of the course The course covers the introductory year 11/1 and 11/2 and two year qualification phase (half-years 12/1;12/2;13/1 and 13/2). The general qualification for university entrance examination is accomplished in the second half year of the 13th class. The only transfer is from 11th to 12th class. Qualification Phase The pupils start the Qualification Phase 12/1 with their selected subject combinations and have to take it till the last school year 13/2. At the end of 13/2 they will have a demanded exam and to get finally their general qualification for university entrance.

A versatile defensive midfielder, Beaumont made the breakthrough into the Dundee United first team during the 1983‚Äì84 season, but found it hard to get a regular spot in a defence with a back four of Malpas, Gough, Hegarty and Narey. He was used as cover for all four, and appeared as a defensive midfielder occasionally over the next couple of seasons. Beaumont spent nearly half of the 1986‚Äì87 season in the starting eleven, his best run in the first team, making 40 appearances, and played in six matches of United's UEFA Cup run that season, including an appearance as substitute for Paul Sturrock in the first leg of the final. Beaumont left United in January 1989 for Luton Town, for whom he appeared in the 1989 Football League Cup Final. He returned to Scotland with Hibernian in October 1991. Weeks later, he was an unused substitute as they beat Dunfermline Athletic in the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final. Injuries hampered him after this, however, and he was forced to quit the senior game in 1994. Beaumont became a police officer in Fife, playing for the Scottish Police team.

The acceptance condition separates a Muller automaton from other œâ-automata. The Muller automaton is defined using Muller acceptance condition, i.e. the set of all states visited infinitely often must be an element of the acceptance set. Both deterministic and non-deterministic Muller automata recognize the œâ-regular languages. They are named after David E. Muller, an American mathematician and computer scientist, who invented them in 1963. Formal definition Formally, a deterministic Muller-automaton is a tuple A = (Q,Œ£,Œ¥,q0,F) that consists of the following information: * Q is a finite set. The elements of Q are called the states of A. * Œ£ is a finite set called the alphabet of A. * Œ¥: Q √ó Œ£ ‚Üí Q is a function, called the transition function of A. * q0 is an element of Q, called the initial state. * F is a set of sets of states. Formally, F ‚äÜ P(Q) where P(Q) is powerset of Q. F defines the acceptance condition. A accepts exactly those runs in which the set of infinitely often occurring states is an element of F In a non-deterministic Muller automaton, the transition function Œ¥ is replaced with a transition relation Œî that returns a set of states and initial state is q0 is replaced by a set of initial states Q0. Generally, Muller automaton refers to non- deterministic Muller automaton. For more comprehensive formalism look at œâ-automaton. Equivalence with other œâ-automata The Muller automata are equally expressive as parity automata, Rabin Automata, Streett automata, and non-deterministic B√ºchi automata, to mention some, and strictly more expressive than the deterministic B√ºchi automata. The equivalence of the above automata and non-deterministic Muller automata can be shown very easily as the accepting conditions of these automata can be emulated using the acceptance condition of Muller automata. McNaughton's Theorem demonstrates the equivalence of non-deterministic B√ºchi automaton and deterministic Muller automaton. Thus, deterministic and non-deterministic Muller automaton are equivalent in terms of the languages they can accept. Transformation to non- deterministic Muller automaton Following is a list of automata constructions which transforms a type of œâ-automata to a non-deterministic Muller automaton. ;From B√ºchi automaton :If B is the set of final states in a B√ºchi automata with the set of states Q, we can construct a Muller automata with same set of states, transition function and initial state with the muller accepting condition as F = { X  X ‚àà 2Q ‚àß X ‚à© B ‚â† \\\\emptyset} ;From Rabin automaton/Parity automaton :Similarly, the Rabin conditions (E_j,F_j) can be emulated by constructing the acceptance set in the Muller automata as all sets in F \\\\subseteq 2^Q which satisfy F \\\\cap E_j = \\\\emptyset \\\\land F \\\\cap F_j eq \\\\emptyset, for some j. Note that this covers the case of Parity automaton too, as the Parity acceptance condition can be expressed as Rabin acceptance condition easily. ;From Streett automaton :The Streett conditions (E_j,F_j) can be emulated by constructing the acceptance set in the Muller automata as all sets in F \\\\subseteq 2^Q which satisfy F \\\\cap E_j = \\\\emptyset \\\\rightarrow F \\\\cap F_j = \\\\emptyset, for all j. Transformation to deterministic muller automaton ;Union of two deterministic muller automaton ;From B√ºchi automaton McNaughton's Theorem provides a procedure to transform non-deterministic B√ºchi automaton to deterministic Muller automaton.

The screenplay was based on a story of the same title, both written by Michael Jenning. Plot Truman Gates (Patrick Swayze), raised in Appalachia, has migrated to Chicago to become a police officer. Married to Jessie (Helen Hunt), who is pregnant, he seems to have made the transition from hillbilly to respectable lawman. When the local coal mine closes, Truman persuades his younger brother Gerald (Bill Paxton) to look for work in Chicago. But things take a turn for the worse when soon after landing a job as a truck driver, Gerald's vehicle is hijacked by mobsters and Gerald is killed by Joey Rosellini (Adam Baldwin), the nephew of mob boss Papa John Isabella (Andreas Katsulas). Truman returns to Kentucky for the funeral. When his surviving brother, Briar Gates (Liam Neeson), insists on a traditional mountain blood feud, Truman urges his family to let the police deal with Gerald's murder. Briar finds Truman's reluctance to be disgraceful. Determined to deal with the murderers in his own way, Briar travels to Chicago in search of his youngest brother's killer. Meanwhile, Truman desperately tries to solve the crime before Briar takes revenge on his own. He approaches John Isabella and explains the mountain code to him. He suggests that if Gerald's murderer surrenders peacefully, it would save them both a lot of trouble. John, however, refuses on general principle, and Truman is left to continue his investigation. After arriving in town, Briar gets a room at a flop house. Before he leaves, he gives the front desk clerk the phone number of his cousin back home and asks him to call the number if he doesn't return by morning. Not wasting any time, Briar goes looking for information on the man who killed Gerald and, during his search, shoots up a local mob hangout. When Truman arrives a little later, Joey, embarrassed by the attack, says he is not pressing charges against Briar. He intends to \\"handle things\\" himself. When Papa John says he feels things are getting out of hand, Joey dismisses the threat, saying that the Gates family, \\"plow rocks for a living.\\" John responds, \\"That's what they said about 'our' people back in Sicily.\\" Working together for a time, Briar and Truman learn the identity of the hijackers from a witness. Truman pressures Lawrence (Ben Stiller), the son of Papa John, to turn state's evidence against Joey. Lawrence goes to Joey for help, only to have Joey betray him. Lawrence's body is found with evidence of being tortured, and Briar's shotgun is found at the scene. Joey goes to Papa John, who devastated by his son's death, sanctions a hit on the supposed culprit. Before he can, Briar breaks into Rosellini's trucking company and engages in a gunfight with Joey's crew and kills two of Joey's guys before Joey shoots Briar twice. Fatally wounded, Briar dies in Truman's arms. When the flop house desk clerk hears about the deaths at the Trucking Company on the news, he calls the phone number that Briar gave him. Even though both Truman and the police know that the evidence against Briar was planted, and that Briar's death was an ambush, there is no proof. Truman resigns from the police force and goes after the Rosellini mob himself. As the Gates family gathers together and travels to Chicago to begin a war against the Outfit, Truman goes on the offensive and throws one of Joey's guys through the window of a restaurant. When Joey comes out, he finds \\"You forgot one,\\" painted on Joey's car, and he vows to kill Truman without Papa John's permission. Truman lures the Rosellini crew to a darkened cemetery, where an extended battle ensues, including the arrival of the Gates clan (and their hound dogs and rattlesnakes). In the end, Truman has Joey pinned on the ground with a knife to his throat only to be stopped when Papa John arrives with members of the Gates family held at gunpoint. He orders Truman to drop the knife and move out of the way. Papa John has learned the truth about Lawrence's murder, and to Joey's horror, he points the gun not at Truman, but at him. Joey asks him what is he going to do. The Don tells Joey, \\"This is for killing my son,\\" and he fatally shoots Joey. The Gates and Isabella families call a truce. Back at the police station, Truman finds Jessie and tells her, \\"You're my family.\\" Cast *Patrick Swayze as Truman Gates *Liam Neeson as Briar Gates *Adam Baldwin as Joey Rosselini *Helen Hunt as Jessie Gates *Bill Paxton as Gerald Gates *Ben Stiller as Lawrence Isabella *Andreas Katsulas as John Isabella *Michael J.

Critic Brian Orndorf wrote, \\"Next of Kin isn't a dazzling picture, but there's personality about it that eases the blow of idiocy, keeping the adventure of Truman Gates, redneck cop, alive and well.\\" It earned a Razzie Award nomination for Patrick Swayze as Worst Actor (also for Road House), where he lost to William Shatner for Star Trek V: The Final Frontier. In Sweden it was retitled Dirty Fighting (in English) to capitalize on Swayze's earlier success with Dirty Dancing. The film has since become a cult classic.  Soundtrack  A soundtrack to the film was also released through Columbia Records.

He was the founder of Consolidated Foods, which later became known by one of its product lines, Sara Lee Corporation. Early life Nathan Cummings was born in 1896 in Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada, the first child of Jewish parents who had immigrated from Lithuania. It was pure chance that he was born Canadian: his parents had disembarked in Saint John, the first port of call, assuming it was their destination, New York City. The family later moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, setting up a small shoe shop. They moved to Manchester, New Hampshire, and eventually relocated their business in Montreal around the time of World War I. Cummings was not able to finish high school, but was sent to the Dry Goods Economist Training School in New York for a year before returning to work with his father. From the age of fifteen he sold shoes until, at nineteen, he took on the job of traveling salesman for a shoe manufacturer. Business career By 1924 Cummings had established a shoe shop and factory of his own by 1924, but the business foundered during the Depression, and he was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1932. He paid off his debts and started anew. By the mid-1930s he had invested in McCormicks, a biscuit and candy company in Canada. The success of that business, which he sold to Weston in 1939,J. Ernest Kerr, Imprint of the Maritimes, 1959, Boston: Christopher Publishing, p. 71 prompted an invitation to manage the Baltimore-based coffee, tea and sugar chain, C.D. Kenny Company. Cummings acquired the company in 1941. Its continued prosperity allowed him to expand his holdings to found a business empire. Over the next decade, Cummings invested within company after company. In 1945 he established his corporate headquarters in Chicago and formed the Consolidated Grocers Corporation as a holding company. Time proclaimed him the \\"Duke of Groceries.\\"Time, \\"The Duke of Groceries\\", February 7, 1944 In 1954 the company name was changed to Consolidated Foods Corporation, which Cummings thought was 'less old- fashioned', and in 1985 the name Sara Lee Corporation was adopted. Sara Lee was the name of one of the company's best known brands, which Cummings had acquired in 1956. Cummings retired from the company in 1968, but remained honorary chairman and active in company affairs until his death in 1985. Marriage/Family Cummings' first wife was Ruth Lillian Kellert, whom he married in 1919. She died in 1952. In 1959, he wed Joanne Toor; the marriage ended in divorce in 1976. Upon his death in 1985, Cummings was survived by three children from his first marriage, Beatrice Cummings Mayer of Chicago [1921-2018], Herbert Cummings of Paradise Valley, Ariz., and Alan H. Cummings of Palm Beach; ; a sister, Mrs. Monroe Abbey, of Montreal; four brothers, Maxwell, Benjamin, Ralph, and Harold, one sister, Minnie, all of Montreal, and nine grandchildren. Cummings was related to MGM's legendary studio boss Louis B. Mayer through marriage. Louis B. Mayer's older sister Ida was married to Louis Komiensky, brother to Nate's father, David Komiensky. In 1992, a history of the Cummings family entitled David and Bessie Komiensky, Jewish Lithuanian Immigrants: A Brief Family History, was commissioned by friends as a surprise gift for Herbert Kellert Cummings, and published by Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Art collector As Cummings became increasingly affluent, he began to collect art. His first significant acquisition was made in Paris in 1945, immediately after World War II, when he purchased Camille Pissarro's Bountiful Harvest 1893, which he noticed in the window of an art dealer. He knew nothing of Pissarro, but he was confident in what he liked. There was little in Nathan Cummings' background to suggest an affinity with art. Later in his life he liked to tell of his first tentative encounter with art: \\"An advertising man convinced me that I should have a painting made of the view from my window.\\" Cummings liked it so much that he asked the artist to paint the scene a second time - the view at night. His satisfaction with these works sparked an interest in collecting art that was to develop with the passion of the newly converted. Cummings' collections were diverse, including French Impressionist paintings, modern sculpture, ancient Peruvian ceramics, and works of living artists such as Henry Moore, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Georges Braque, Giacomo Manz√π and Alberto Giacometti, who became members of his social circle. He enjoyed friendships with other celebrities, including Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Bob Hope, a good friend who emerged from a giant cake at Cummings's eightieth birthday. As a collector, Cummings did not confine himself to the acquisition of blue-chip impressionist and 20th-century master paintings. He enjoyed contemporary art and delighted in new discoveries. He often acquired whole series of works by artists he liked, later distributing the works to friends or scattering them around the workplace. At one time he owned a fishing fleet and ensured that each of the fifteen boats was equipped with its own work of art. He bought and sold without expecting to keep the works forever, allowing old favorites to be replaced by new enthusiasms. Cummings expected that everyone would share his passion for art: as well as giving away works of art as presents, he displayed parts of his collection in the offices of his companies for the enjoyment of the staff. Philanthropy Starting in the 1950s Cummings became a major donor to hospitals, universities, arts organizations, and Jewish causes. His endowment created the Nathan Cummings Arts Center at Stanford University and the Joanne and Nathan Cummings Art Center at Connecticut College in New London. (Joanne Toor Cummings was the second wife of Cummings; she died in 1995.) He made major contributions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and to the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1949 he established the Nathan Cummings Foundation, which received most of his estate (then estimated at $200 million) upon his death. The foundation funds initiatives to build a socially and economically just society.

The town was abandoned after earthquakes in the 13th century; today the area is administered as a frazione of the comune of Manfredonia, in the province of Foggia. Siponto is located around 3 km south of Manfredonia.  History  According to legend, Sipontum was founded by Diomedes, product of the union of the Homeric hero of the same name with the daughter of the king of the Daunians. Siponto was probably founded by the Daunians. Sipontum was a flourishing Greek colony, its Greek name being Sipious (Œ£ŒπœÄŒπŒøœçœÇ); having fallen into the hands of the Samnites, it was retaken about 335 BC by King Alexander of Epirus, uncle of Alexander the Great. In 189 BC it became a Roman colony with its original Sipious name still used in Byzantine times, and in 663 AD it was taken and destroyed by the Slavs. In the ninth century, Sipontum was for a time in the power of the Saracens; in 1042 the Normans made it the seat of one of their twelve counties. The latter won a decisive victory there over the Byzantine general Argyrus in 1052. Michael of Zahumlje on 10 July 926 sacked Siponto, which was a Byzantine town in Apulia.Raƒçki, Odlomci iz dr≈æavnoga pr√°va hrvatskoga za narodne dynastie:, p. 15 It remains unknown if he did this by Tomislav's supreme command as suggested by some historians. Apparently, Tomislav sent the Croatian navy under Michael's leadership to drive the Saracens from that part of southern Italy and free the city.Omrƒçanin, Military history of Croatia:, p. 24 The city produced one of the greatest medieval Jewish scholars, Rabbi Isaac ben Melchizedek, who composed one of the earliest commentaries on the Mishnah, a compendium of ancient Jewish oral law.  Ecclesiastical history = Ancient bishopric  According to legend, the Gospel was preached at Sipontum by Saint Peter and by Saint Mark; more trust, however, may be placed in the tradition of the martyrdom of the priest Saint Justin and his companions under Gallienus and Maximian about 255. A bishopric of Sipontum (or Siponto) was established around 400 AD (or already in the third century according to others). The first bishop whose date may be fixed, was Felix, who was at Rome in 465. In the time of bishop Laurence of Siponto, during the papacy of Gelasius I (492-496), took place on Monte Gargano the apparition of Saint Michael, in memory of which the famous Monastery of the Archangel was founded. Other residential bishops were * Saint Bishop Lorenzo Maiorano (520? ‚Äì death 7 February 545. * Saint Bishop Milone (? ‚Äì ?) About 688 it was suppressed, as Pope Vitalian was obliged to entrust to the then bishopric of Benevento, into which it merged, the pastoral care of Sipontum, which was almost abandoned. Online version, New Advent.  New (arch)bishopric  The see was re- established in 1034 as Diocese of Siponto, recovering its territory from the meanwhile Metropolitan Archdiocese of Benevento. Suffragan Bishops of Siponto were : * Buono (1049? ‚Äì 1059?) * Gerardo (1066 ‚Äì 1074) Under bishop Saint Gerard(o) (1066‚Äì74) it became the non-Metropolitan Archdiocese of Siponto in 1074.

The ancient cathedral remained still at Sipontum but, with the building of Manfredonia city by and named after King Manfred of Sicily, who decided to 'rebuild Siponto' in a new nearby location, the archiepiscopal see was transferred to the new town in 1230, under its new title Metropolitan Archdiocese of Manfredonia (viz.), yet still Sipontin(us) as Latin adjective.

It was called Slingerbultsleden (\\"Dodge Route\\") by its users, and was replaced by the more permanent Centralbron in the late-1950s.

Notwithstanding the motorway's official name, Stockholmers often refer to it simply as Munkbron, a name officially given to the square Munkbron, while historically referring to the western quay of the old town.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts, he entered the Boston Latin School in 1820. He married Mary Greenwood Wild on 9 March 1832. Couthouy applied to President Andrew Jackson for a position on the Scientific Corps of the U.S. Navy's Exploring Expedition of 1838. He sailed with the expedition on 18 August 1838, but was sent to the Sandwich Islands for sick leave. Eventually, he dismissed according to Charles Wilkes for attempting to \\"promote dissension, bring me into disrepute, and destroy the harmony and efficiency of the Squadron.\\" Although he meticulously labeled all of his specimens from the expedition, Dall recounts how \\"The authorities in Washington had appointed a reverened gentleman who knew nothing of science, with a fat salary, to unpack and take care of the specimens sent home by the expedition.\\" This gentleman then separated the specimens from the tags thus rendering many of them useless. Couthouy returned to Washington and tried to work up what he could of the collection and was then informed, \\"to crown all of his misfortunes\\", that his pay was to be reduced by forty-four percent. He then returned to his profession as a master in the merchant marine, visiting South America and the Pacific. In 1854, he took command of an expedition to the Bay of Cuman√°, where he spent three unsuccessful years in search of the wreck of the Spanish treasure ship San Pedro, lost there in the early part of the century. A good linguist, he spoke fluent Spanish, French, Italian, and Portuguese, and had mastered several dialects used in the Pacific Islands. In the American Civil War, Couthouy was ordered to command on 31 December 1862, which was wrecked, and Couthouy made prisoner. He later commanded . Finally, he commanded during the Red River Campaign. On 2 April 1864, he was shot by a sniper and died the following day. See alsoReferences * Abbott, R.T., and M.E. Young (eds.). 1973.

Marks gained in at least two units of English must also be included in the calculation of the Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) used to determine entry to university. Students must study one of the following courses: * English (Advanced) * English (Standard) * English as a Second Language (ESL) * English Studies (formerly not an ATAR course) Optional courses include: * English Extension 1 * English Extension 2 * Fundamentals of English (discontinued in 2018) Modules The Area of Study is a common module between English (Advanced) and English (Standard). It involves examining how a selection of prescribed texts provided by the NSW Board of Studies, and other related materials chosen by the student, portray and represent specific themes and ideas (e.g. \\"Belonging\\" and \\"Discovery\\"). English (Advanced) and English (Standard) also consists of their own three modules of study in addition to the Area of Study: * Module A - Experience Through Contexts (Standard) / Comparative Study of Texts and Contexts (Advanced) * Module B - Close Study of Text (Standard) / Critical Study of Text (Advanced) * Module C - Texts and Society (Standard) / Representation and Text (Advanced) As of the updated 2018 syllabus, the Area of Study has been replaced with the common module Texts and Human Experiences for English (Advanced), English (Standard) and English Studies. The modules of English (Advanced) and English (Standard) have also been replaced: * Module A - Language, Identity and Culture (Standard) / Textual Conversations (Advanced) * Module B remains unchanged aside from new prescribed texts. * Module C has been changed into a Creative Writing module: The Craft of Writing. Both Advanced and Standard students study this module, but their prescribed texts for basis and analysis are different. English Extension 1 The English Extension 1 course is for candidates that wish to undergo further study of English in their Higher School Certificate. The English (Advanced) course and Preliminary English Extension course are a prerequisite. There are three modules in the English Extension 1 course, each with separate electives. Candidates study one elective, choosing three prescribed texts to study. The course is divided into three separate elective studies, with students studying a single module within these elective units: 1.) Genre Study (Life Writing, Comedy, or Science Fiction) 2.) Texts and Ways of Thinking (After the Bomb, Romanticism, Navigating the Global) 3.) Language and Values (Textual Dynamics, Language and Gender) As of the 2018 syllabus, Extension 1 now only consists of one common module, Literary Worlds, with five separate electives with their own subjects of study and sets of prescribed texts. English Extension 2 The English Extension 2 course is for candidates that wish to undergo further study of English in their Higher School Certificate. Both the English (Advanced) and English Extension 1 courses are a prerequisite. Students submit a Major Work that may either be under the print medium (short story/ies, poems, critical response, scripts - radio, television, film and drama), the sound medium (speeches, radio drama, performance poetry), or the visual medium (video, multimedia). Candidates write a 1500-word Reflection Statement to accompany their Major Work. The Major Work is marked internally as a process and draft, and externally as a product. Unlike the English Advanced and English Extension 1 courses, there is no HSC exam for English Extension 2, with the final HSC mark determined solely by the external marking of the Major Work. Examinations English Paper 1 is a two-hour examination (plus 10 minutes reading time) usually conducted on the first day of the HSC exams. The paper is common to both English (Standard) and English (Advanced) students and is thus the most widely sat HSC exam. English Paper 1 tests the Area of Study through three questions: * Question 1 (15 marks/40 minutes)): unseen texts - requires students to deconstruct and analyse a number of unseen texts of a variety of forms. There are a number of short questions (1-2 marks), building up to a longer answer (approx 6 marks). * Question 2 (15 marks/40 minutes): creative writing. The text type may be specified or liberal. * Question 3 (15 marks/40 minutes): extended response. Students usually answer on their core text, one text from the Board of Studies stimulus booklet (no longer used) and one or more texts of their own choice. It is usually written in essay form. English Paper 2 is a two-hour examination (plus 5 minutes reading time) usually conducted on the second day of the HSC exams. The paper is different between English (Standard) and English (Advanced). The response form of these questions may be specified or liberal but is normally in essay form, although other forms may occasionally be appropriate. English Paper 2 tests the English Modules through three questions, on the individual modules (A, B and C), all worth 20 marks with 40 minutes recommended writing time. As of the 2018 syllabus, Paper 1 has been reduced to two questions (both 20 marks/45 minutes) - unseen texts and extended response. Creative writing has been shifted to Paper 2 with the new Module C - The Craft of Writing. English Extension 1 has a two-hour examination (plus 5 minutes reading time). Students answer two questions relating to the module or elective they have studied, each marked out of 25 and allocated approximately one hour of writing. English Extension 2 has no examination but students submit a Major Work at the end of the course.

He was also a patient, close friend, and probable lover of the suspected serial killer Dr John Bodkin Adams. Childhood Gwynne's father made a fortune in the nineteenth century from an engineering business, Gwynnes Limited, and bought estates in Sussex with the proceeds. Gwynne's mother, May, was 41 when he was born. He was the last of nine children (though two had died). Until the age of 13, he was dressed by his mother as a girl in frocks, with bows, necklaces and long ringlets.Cullen, Pamela V., \\"A Stranger in Blood: The Case Files on Dr John Bodkin Adams\\", London, Elliott & Thompson, 2006, He was educated privately before being sent to Trinity Hall, Cambridge. The renowned harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse was one of his sisters. One brother, Rupert, was Member of Parliament for Eastbourne from 1910 until his death in 1924; his daughter was the celebrated cookery writer Elizabeth David. His mother's great-grandfather was Dutch and great-grandmother was a Sumatran. Career After university he served in the honorary post of Judge's Marshal. On 2 April 1904 he was commissioned to Second Lieutenant in the Sussex YeomanryLondon Gazette and made Lieutenant on 1 April 1908.London Gazette In 1904 Gwynne aided Viscount Turnour in his maiden election campaign in the constituency of Horsham, which Turnour then held for the next 47 years.The Sussex County Magazine In 1910 Gwynne was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple, where he practised in the Probate and Divorce Division.Ken Good, The House of Gwynne, Bookmarque Publishing 2002 The First World War broke out when Gwynne was 32. He was sent a white feather, a symbol of cowardice, by a \\"friend of the family\\" and in September 1916 he volunteered for active service. He won the Distinguished Service Order in Flanders in 1917 while attached to the Queen's Royal Regiment, much to the surprise of his family. He was wounded twice, leaving him with a permanent limp. On 8 April 1921, he was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.London Gazette In 1922, his mother died, leaving most of her money to Gwynne due to a family disagreement. That same year, Gwynne put his name forward as a Conservative candidate for Lewes, East Sussex, but withdrew it when his brother Neville hinted to the selection committee that Gwynne was a homosexual (around this time MP Noel Pemberton Billing was leading a witch hunt against homosexuals). John Bodkin Adams arrived in Eastbourne that same year. Rupert died in 1924, just after being re-elected to Parliament. Gwynne inherited his estate, but settled for local politics, being High Sheriff of Sussex in 1926/27 and then mayor of Eastbourne in 1928. While he was mayor, in 1929 the town bought of land surrounding Beachy Head, to save it from development, costing the town around ¬£100,000.The Times, 30 October 1929. p. 11 His term as mayor ended in 1931. On 9 November that year, he was made the 8th ever Honorary Freeman of Eastbourne for his services to the borough.List of Freemen of Eastbourne He stayed in local politics, being Chairman of the East Sussex County Council from 1937 to 1940. He constantly had financial problems, caused on the one hand by his extravagant lifestyle (he was famous for the wild parties he held at Folkington Manor, attended by, among others, The 1st Marquess of Willingdon, who had previously served as both Governor General of Canada and Viceroy of India, and Rudyard Kipling) and on the other, by his sexuality, which made him a prime target for blackmail. Indeed, his butler Wilde was known by those close to him to be one such person extorting money from him. After Gwynne's death, love letters from various local jockeys were found among his papers. During the Second World War, he became addicted to alcohol. In 1947, burdened with debt, he was forced to rent out Folkington and move into the smaller Wootton Manor. John Bodkin Adams Gwynne never married but he developed a close friendship with Dr John Bodkin Adams, an unmarried Eastbourne general practitioner and suspected serial killer, with whom he went on frequent shooting holidays to Scotland and Ireland. He would visit Adams every morning at 9 a.m. During the police investigation into Adams, a note written by a journalist was uncovered linking Adams sexually to a member of the local police and a local magistrate. The police officer is strongly suspected to have been the Deputy Chief Constable of Eastbourne, Alexander Seekings, and the magistrate to have been Gwynne. Despite the illegality of homosexual sex in 1956/57, the matter was not investigated further by police. In 1956, Adams was arrested on suspicion of murdering two of his patients. At that time Gwynne was Chairman of the Magistrates in Lewes, East Sussex, and had to step down from the committal hearing owing to a conflict of interest. On 12 February 1957, just before Adams' trial began,London Gazette Gwynne was knighted. During the proceedings, though, Colonel Gwynne was seen dining with Lord Goddard, the Lord Chief Justice, and Sir Hartley Shawcross, a former Attorney General, at a hotel in Lewes. Lord Goddard had by then already appointed the judge for Adams' case, Sir Patrick Devlin. After their meeting at the hotel Gwynne crashed his car while driving home. No evidence was adduced he had been drinking. The meeting was seen by one of the investigating officers from Scotland Yard, Charles Hewett, as further indication that the Adams' trial was the subject of concerted judicial and political interference.Cullen, Page 633. During the actual trial, while the jury was out discussing the verdict on Adams' first charge of murder, Lord Goddard phoned Devlin to urge him, if Adams was found not guilty, to grant him bail before he was tried on a second count of murder. Devlin was surprised since a person accused of murder had never been given bail before in British legal history.Devlin, Patrick; \\"Easing the Passing\\", 1985 A month after the trial on 10 May 1957, Goddard heard a contempt of court case against magazine Newsweek and the shop chain W. H. Smith & Son, which on 1 April during Adams' trial had respectively published and distributed an issue of the magazine containing two paragraphs of material \\"highly prejudicial to the accused\\", saying that Adams' victim count could be \\"as high as 400\\". Each company was fined ¬£50. Adams was sensationally acquitted of one murder charge, with a second charge being controversially withdrawn by the Attorney General. Gwynne cooled his relationship with Adams and even admitted to police, when interviewed in connection with the investigation into Adams, that he had given instructions to be buried in a lead-lined coffin. This unusual procedure was usually designed to protect the water table from contamination or to preserve evidence in case an exhumation might ever be necessary. Post Adams Gwynne fell into depression and in 1963 suffered a stroke. He was admitted to Berrow Nursing and Convalescent Home in Eastbourne in March 1964, having executed a Power of Attorney allowing Sir Dingwall Bateson to take control of his financial and property affairs. After Bateson's death in 1967, Gwynne's solicitors applied to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a Receiver to take over from Bateson. No family members were able or willing to take on the role, and so the Official Solicitor was appointed. According to Gwynne's doctor, he was unable to manage his own affairs due to 'Senile dementia with arteriosclerosis'.The National Archives, Kew, London, item J92/295: GWYNNE, Sir Roland Richard He died on 15 November 1971, in the nursing home, aged 89. His death certificate was signed by Dr Adams.Cullen, p. 635 His last will left his estate, valued at around ¬£1.7 million,In 2002's money (according to K.

Despite holding both titles simultaneously the roles of \\"HM Chief Inspector of Fire and Rescue Services\\", and that of \\"Fire and Rescue Adviser\\" differ slightly. There is currently an HMCI in England, Wales, and Scotland ‚Äì all of whom are also fire and rescue advisers to their respective governments. Both roles are categorical in law and cannot be overruled except by the sovereign. In his or her political capacity as \\"Fire and Rescue Adviser\\" the post holder is responsible for advising their respective UK governments on all matters concerning the fire and rescue service in their jurisdiction. As Her Majesty's Chief Inspector the post holder is responsible for auditing of all the local authority fire services in their jurisdiction to ensure they meet strict performance criteria and targets laid out by the government. Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Her Majesty's current Chief Inspector for England is also the UK's Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser. He is the former Chief Fire Officer of Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service, Peter Holland CBE. The role of CFRA also includes additional responsibilities to HM Government. The CFRA is the most senior Fire and Rescue Service adviser to the United Kingdom Government, advising on policy, procedures, and legislative changes affecting the UK Fire Service. The devolved administrations consider and adopt UK policies and procedures where applicable. Each Inspectorate (England Wales and Scotland) reports on the activities of the public fire and rescue services in the UK as well as the Defence Fire and Rescue Service (which operated by the Ministry of Defence) on a voluntary basis. Airport fire authorities are inspected by the Civil Aviation Authority. The HMFSI's equivalent in Scotland is Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate for Scotland. Background In February 2007, the UK government announced it was setting up a new unit to advise ministers on fire and rescue issues and creating the role of Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser (CFRA) confirming in May the same year that Sir Ken Knight had been appointed to the position.Department for Communities and Local Government, News Release 022, New Advisory Unit for Fire and Rescue Services to be Set Up, 8 February 2007Communities and Local Government News Release 099, 24 May 2007, New Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser Appointed In October 2007, Sir Ken left the London Fire Brigade to start his new role.Dept for Communities and Local govt: News Release 174 - New Advisory Unit for the Fire & Rescue Service starts work, published 1 Oct 2007 The announcement was made by the then fire minister Angela Smith. The purpose of the unit and its adviser is to \\"provide ministers and civil servants with independent professional advice on fire and rescue issues\\". The Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser also retains the historic title of HM Chief Inspector which was traditionally given to the head of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Fire Service. The new unit and its chief advisor will replace HMFSI, its function is to advise ministers, COBR and other government departments; and local government. The Chief Fire and Rescue Adviser or CFRA reports to the Department for Communities and Local Government, which was renamed to Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in 2018. The new units remit only extends to England and Wales. Knight was succeeded in the role by Peter Holland on 28 January 2013. The separate Inspectorate in Scotland Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate is under the leadership of its Chief Inspector, Steven Torrie. The role of the CFRA The DfCLG has outlined the general functions of the CFRA, and the new unit: *Advise ministers and senior staff on structure, organisation and performance, including equality, of fire and rescue services *It will identify and disseminate good practice to fire and rescue services *Continue the successful drive to reduce fire deaths, which have been halved in England over the last quarter of a century *It will also advise and liaise with government, local authorities, professional bodies and other interested organisations on fire, rescue and resilience matters *Is the umbrella organisation of the Crown Premises Inspection Group (CPIG). CPIG is the team of fire inspectors, appointed by the Secretary of State, to enforce the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order) 2005 within Crown premises. The detailed job description was made available to the public ahead of Sir Ken's appointment. It said the role of CFRA comes with a \\"substantial six figure package\\". The CFRA will have to set up the new unit, the last HM Chief inspector of Fire Services was Sir Graham Meldrum who retired in January 2007. The new post of CFRA has been created to reflect changes to the fire and rescue service in the UK brought about by the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, although it only applies to England and Wales. However, it is anticipated that the CFRA will advise the government on any major incident in the UK.

He was an amateur and autodidact, who was actually the owner of a carpet and soft furnishings factory. He was also a devoted family man with 12 children. He assembled, thanks to his many connections all over the world, a large part of the shell collection of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, which consists of 9,000,000 specimens and is one of the three largest shell collections in the world. He was a participant in the scientific surveys of Prince Albert I of Monaco and the author of 210 published works (between 1881 and 1937 (post mortem) ) in the field of malacology. He described 1895 new taxa. He collected shells from an early age, resulting in his personal collection of about 4.5 million specimens, relating to 33,000 Recent taxa and 7,000 fossil species.

History  Today you can find the first trace of humans by the hillsides that was once beaches in an archipelago. The border between Sweden and Norway went through Biskopsg√•rden from the 13th century until 1658, when Bohusl√§n belonged to Sweden. One of the old yards, Biskopsg√•rden, was used when the Bishop came to visit. Its area stretched up to the mountains over the current Biskopsg√•rden, and it is from there that it got its name. In ten years an area along the tram rail was built for 25,000 people. In the middle of the 1950s, an expansion of Biskopsg√•rden was started. Around 1958, people, such as authors and professors, moved to Biskopsg√•rden. After the labor migration on 1950s and 1960s, Biskopsg√•rden acquired an immigrant character. The proportion of professionals was higher than average, as well as average earnings. During the 1980s and 1990s, Biskopsg√•rden had changed and renewed. Today, Biskopsg√•rden has improved due to reparation, as well as social and cultural investments. On January 1, 2011, Biskopsg√•rden and Torslanda joined together and formed Western Hisingens district. In Gothenburg the number of district has been halved to ten. In 2005, Biskopsg√•rden was one of the areas, together with northeastern Gothenburg, where a large share of Somalis resident in Gothenburg lived which led to the drug khat being openly sold in public spaces. In its December 2015 report, Police in Sweden placed the district in the most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates. Living and population= Demographics  Biskopsg√•rden has approximately 12,750 dwellings. The majority of dwellings were constructed during the 1950s. In the spring of 2007, a program for new dwellings was approved by the building committee. The population of the district is approximately 25,600 (2008). The population has decreased a lot since the 1960s, then the population was above 37,000. The district is close to a large green area and major thoroughfares. In the 2011-13 period, about 55% of the population originated outside the EU and the Nordic Countries. The inhabitants of western parts of Biskopsg√•rden district have a low level of education, where 16% have a post secondary education of 3 years or above which is low compared to the rest of Gothenburg. About a third of school pupils leave mandatory 9-year school without qualifying for secondary education, compared to a fifth for Gothenburg as a whole. The employment rate is 56%, which is low compared to Gothenburg but slightly higher than vulnerable areas Bergsj√∂n and Angered. Conversely, the proportion of households receiving social welfare support is high. Participation in the 2010 council election was low at 62%. Development Further development of Biskopsg√•rden will need to reduce the isolated nature of the area to more closely integrate it with the rest of the city. The district has gone through major changes during its lifetime. An example on this is that; the ethnic diversity has increased; some of the blocks have been renovated or rebuilt. The Live-good process was started in 1993, a unique development forum, with the purpose of improving the district for the resident. The vision of the Live-good process is to have attractive preschool/school, better marketing, safety, own supply, good housing, and collaboration and accommodation dialogue. The district has three large business squares, L√§nsmanstorget, V√•rv√§derstorget and Friskv√§derstorget that are natural meeting places for the residents. The squares have a variety of small shops. Biskopsg√•rden have large planned neighbor areas used as natural meeting places for residents. Svarte Mosses has a large green area that gives the possibility to have activity meeting-places, such as barbecue places, caf√©, nature pathways, miniature golf, and other sports activities. The district has a geographical central location, with three tram services that connect the area with the city centre. The trams leaves every five minutes and it takes approximately 15 minutes to travel to the city. Education In Biskopsg√•rden there are 5 schools, one in each primary area. Ryaskolan. In South and North Biskopsg√•rden there are two properties with housing and daytime activities for older children. There is also two youth recreation centres and one library. There is a very well developed association life, with 80 compounds that are working in the district. About 50 compounds are focused on culture, politics and hobbies, 20 are sports associations and about 15 are pensioners associations. In 2018, kindergartens in Biskopsg√•rden district were reprimanded by the Municipality of Gothenburg after G√∂teborgs-Posten newspaper had found out that 4 out of 5 kindergartens stated they were willing to allow girls in their care to wear the Islamic hijab if the parents requested it. Following this finding, staff at 14 preschools and 4 primary schools in Biskopsg√•rden were then educated about promoting children's rights, promote integration and prevent honor-related violence and oppression. Business In Biskopsg√•rden you can find everything from restaurants and barber shops to machine shops and printers. Today there are 966 registered companies in Biskopsg√•rden. However Biskopsg√•rdens industry association was created in 1977. There is an industry area and a small business consisting 70 companies in the South Biskopsg√•rden. The industry area has looked the same the last 15 years. Crime Biskopsg√•rden has witnessed gang violence including gun murders and car bombs. A low point was on 18 March 2015 when two men shot into a restaurant with assault rifles, killing two and injuring ten. Both the targets and perpetrators were involved in large-scale drug crime, save for a murdered bystander. In the aftermath police installed 15 security cameras in the area from December 2016 until July 2018. Biskopsg√•rden has since 2015 been classified as a s√§rskilt utsatt omr√•de (especially vulnerable area) by the Swedish Police, which is defined as an area where criminals have an influence on society and it is hard or impossible for the police to fulfill its role.

TOCA 2 is notable for being one of only four PlayStation games (the others being Wipeout 3: Special Edition, Ridge Racer Type 4 and Andretti Racing) to feature a four-player mode using the PlayStation's link cable and split-screen at the same time - i.e., four players compete against each other simultaneously using two PlayStation consoles, with two players per console and connected to two televisions. All the tracks used in the various championships, including the main BTCC championship, are real racing tracks in Great Britain. These are as follows: Thruxton; Silverstone; Donington Park; Brands Hatch; Oulton Park; Croft; Snetterton; and Knockhill. There are bonus tracks and cars which can be accessed through the championship mode. TOCA 2 for Windows also has the ability to import skins for each car. They can be edited using any paint/drawing program. Reception Rick Sanchez reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Hands down, TOCA 2 one of the best touring-car sims available, and one of the best new driving games for PlayStation.\\" The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator GameRankings.

The square is divided into a northern and a southern part by the block Aurora in which the so-called Petersen House is found. History In the 15th century, the name 'Munkbron' referred to the bridge passing over to Riddarholmen were the Greyfriars abbey was located. As the latter islet, until the 1630s called Gr√•munkeholmen (\\"Greyfriar's islet\\"), received its present name, 'Munkbron' was being used for the quay passing along the western waterfront of the city (see also Riddarholmsbron). The present square, together with the quay passing along the shore and various present or historical spaces nearby, were known under several different names, including Muncke brons Hampnen (\\"Monk's Bridge Harbour\\", 1646), V√•ghusplatsen (\\"Scales Space\\", ?), Munkbrotorget (\\"Monk's Bridge Square\\", 1654) and Munkbrohamnsplatsen (\\"Monk's Bridge Harbour Space\\").

Description Gameplay screenshot showing the Ford Focus RS WRC as driven by McRae in the 2000 World Rally Championship season. It is the second game in the Colin McRae Rally series, featuring the works-entered cars and rallies of the 2000 World Rally Championship. The game has three difficulty levels, namely Novice, Intermediate and Expert. As with the previous game, Colin McRae Rally 2.0 lets players take part in rallying events set in various special stages across the world, and employs a number of cars featured in the 2000 World Rally Championship, such as the Ford Focus RS WRC and Subaru Impreza GC. New features include Arcade mode, with direct head- to-head competition against AI drivers or another player, improved graphics with more detailed vehicle models and interiors, and a cleaner and more minimalist menu system, which would be retained for the rest of the series until the release of Dirt 2 in 2009. Nicky Grist, whom at the time was the co- driver for McRae in 2000, reprises his role from the first game, who would remain until the release of Colin McRae: Dirt in 2007; Grist later returned to voice as himself in Dirt 4 in 2017. The race features a selection of cars featuring engines with a capacity in the region of 2.0, mostly which were in production at the time of the game's release - the Ford Focus, Ford Puma, Mitsubishi Lancer Evo VI, Peugeot 206, SEAT Cordoba, Subaru Impreza, and Toyota Corolla. A number of cars which had been in production a decade or more earlier are also featured - the Ford Sierra Cosworth and Peugeot 205 T16 from the 1980s, and the Ford Escort MK1, Mini Cooper S and Lancia Stratos from the late 1960s or early 1970s. Reception Colin McRae Rally 2.0 received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Colin McRae Rally 2.0 received positive reviews. Aggregating review websites GameRankings and Metacritic gave the PlayStation version 88.82% based on 25 reviews and 90/100 based on 13 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 86.56% based on 18 reviews and 83/100 based on 14 reviews and the Game Boy Advance version 82.50% based on 12 reviews and 80/100 based on 8 reviews. Doug Trueman reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"A superb racer that has depth, a solid framerate, and high replay value. It doesn't get much better than this on PlayStation.\\" In their April 2001 issue, PC Gamer praised the game for its graphics, physics and damage modeling, as well as its many gameplay options. However, they criticized the short rally stages, the high difficulty, and most vehicles and tracks being locked until beating certain levels.

Gameplay As with previous games in the series, Colin McRae Rally 2005 is presented as a realistic rally simulation, with players participating in rallies consisting of 70 stages spread over nine countries. There are over 30 cars available. There is also a revised graphics and damage engine that enables paint scratches on the car, and a new 'career' mode where the player starts out in the lower club leagues and works their way up to compete with Colin McRae in his 2004 Dakar Rally Nissan Pick-Up. In 'Championship' mode the player takes the role of Colin himself competing in six rallies using any 4WD car. The game's graphic engine allows for more realistic damage effects, like broken glass and doors falling off, and a blurred vision effect if the player comes into contact with a hard object. The damage system has similarities to the Demolition Derby one, as a damaged radiator will stall the car, and make it need to restart the engine.

A Mac OS X version of this game, renamed as Colin McRae Rally Mac, was published by Feral Interactive and developed by Robosoft Technologies, marking the first Colin McRae series game for the Mac OS X (now macOS). It was released on 26 October 2007, just six weeks after McRae's death in a helicopter crash. The development of the game was fraught with problems. Apple's switch to Intel Macs, some behind-the- scenes changes at Feral and other issues conspired to keep Colin McRae Rally Mac from being released until fairly late into 2007, despite it being based on PC-game underpinnings that Windows gamers had been enjoying since late 2004. Feral chose to make this release as independent of the PC franchise as possible to avoid any issues that might date it, calling it \\"Colin McRae Rally Mac\\" rather than attaching a year to it. Two mobile game versions of this game were created, a N-Gage title developed by Ideaworks3D and a J2ME title developed by IOMO and published by Digital Bridges.

It is common especially in algebraic topology; for example, Serre spectral sequence can be constructed by first constructing an exact couple. For the definition of an exact couple and the construction of a spectral sequence from it (which is immediate), see spectral sequence#Exact couples. For a basic example, see Bockstein spectral sequence. The present article covers additional materials.  Exact couple of a filtered complex  Let R be a ring, which is fixed throughout the discussion. Note if R is Z, then modules over R are the same thing as abelian groups. Each filtered chain complex of modules determines an exact couple, which in turn determines a spectral sequence, as follows. Let C be a chain complex graded by integers and suppose it is given an increasing filtration: for each integer p, there is an inclusion of complexes: :F_{p-1} C \\\\subset F_p C. From the filtration one can form the associated graded complex: :\\\\operatorname{gr} C = \\\\bigoplus_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty F_p C/F_{p-1} C, which is doubly-graded and which is the zero-th page of the spectral sequence: :E^0_{p, q} = (\\\\operatorname{gr} C)_{p, q} = (F_p C / F_{p-1} C)_{p+q}. To get the first page, for each fixed p, we look at the short exact sequence of complexes: :0 \\\\to F_{p-1} C \\\\to F_p C \\\\to (\\\\operatorname{gr}C)_p \\\\to 0 from which we obtain a long exact sequence of homologies: (p is still fixed) :\\\\cdots \\\\to H_n(F_{p-1} C) \\\\overset{i}\\\\to H_n(F_p C) \\\\overset{j} \\\\to H_n(\\\\operatorname{gr}(C)_p) \\\\overset{k}\\\\to H_{n-1}(F_{p-1} C) \\\\to \\\\cdots With the notation D_{p, q} = H_{p+q} (F_p C), \\\\, E^1_{p, q} = H_{p + q} (\\\\operatorname{gr}(C)_p), the above reads: :\\\\cdots \\\\to D_{p - 1, q + 1} \\\\overset{i}\\\\to D_{p, q} \\\\overset{j} \\\\to E^1_{p, q} \\\\overset{k}\\\\to D_{p - 1, q} \\\\to \\\\cdots, which is precisely an exact couple and E^1 is a complex with the differential d = j \\\\circ k. The derived couple of this exact couple gives the second page and we iterate. In the end, one obtains the complexes E^r_{*, *} with the differential d: :E^r_{p, q} \\\\overset{k}\\\\to D^r_{p - 1, q} \\\\overset{{}^r j}\\\\to E^r_{p - r, q + r - 1}. The next lemma gives a more explicit formula for the spectral sequence; in particular, it shows the spectral sequence constructed above is the same one in more traditional direct construction, in which one uses the formula below as definition (cf. Spectral sequence#The spectral sequence of a filtered complex). .}} Sketch of proof: Remembering d = j \\\\circ k, it is easy to see: :Z^r= k^{-1} (\\\\operatorname{im} i^r), \\\\, B^r = j (\\\\operatorname{ker} i^r), where they are viewed as subcomplexes of E^1. We will write the bar for F_p C \\\\to F_p C / F_{p-1} C. Now, if [\\\\overline{x}] \\\\in Z^{r-1}_{p, q} \\\\subset E^1_{p, q}, then k([\\\\overline{x}]) = i^{r-1}([y]) for some [y] \\\\in D_{p - r, q + r - 1} = H_{p+q-1}(F_p C). On the other hand, remembering k is a connecting homomorphism, k([\\\\overline{x}]) = [d(x)] where x is a representative living in (F_p C)_{p + q}. Thus, we can write: d(x) - i^{r-1}(y) = d(x') for some x' \\\\in F_{p-1}C. Hence, [\\\\overline{x}] \\\\in Z^r_p \\\\Leftrightarrow x \\\\in A^r_p modulo F_{p-1} C, yielding Z_p^r \\\\simeq (A^r_p + F_{p-1}C)/F_{p-1} C. Next, we note that a class in \\\\operatorname{ker}(i^{r-1}: H_{p+q}(F_pC) \\\\to H_{p+q}(F_{p + r - 1} C)) is represented by a cycle x such that x \\\\in d(F_{p+r-1} C). Hence, since j is induced by \\\\overline{\\\\cdot}, B^{r-1}_p = j (\\\\operatorname{ker} i^{r-1}) \\\\simeq (d(A^{r-1}_{p+r-1}) + F_{p-1} C)/F_{p-1} C. We conclude: since A^r_p \\\\cap F_{p-1} C = A^{r-1}_{p-1}, :E^r_{p, *} = {Z^{r-1}_p \\\\over B^{r-1}_p} \\\\simeq {A^r_p + F_{p-1} C \\\\over d(A^{r-1}_{p+r-1}) + F_{p-1}C} \\\\simeq {A^r_p \\\\over d(A^{r-1}_{p+r-1}) + A^{r-1}_{p-1}}. \\\\qquad \\\\square Proof: See the last section of May. \\\\square  Exact couple of a double complex  A double complex determines two exact couples; whence, the two spectral sequences, as follows. (Some authors call the two spectral sequences horizontal and vertical.) Let K^{p,q} be a double complex.We prefer cohomological notation here since the applications are often in algebraic geometry. With the notation G^p = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\ge p} K^{i, *}, for each with fixed p, we have the exact sequence of cochain complexes: :0 \\\\to G^{p+1} \\\\to G^p \\\\to K^{p, *} \\\\to 0. Taking cohomology of it gives rise to an exact couple: :\\\\cdots \\\\to D^{p, q} \\\\overset{j}\\\\to E_1^{p, q} \\\\overset{k}\\\\to \\\\cdots where we used the notation By symmetry, that is, by switching first and second indexes, one also obtains the other exact couple.  Example: Serre spectral sequence  The Serre spectral sequence arises from a fibration: :F \\\\to E \\\\to B. For the sake of transparency, we only consider the case when the spaces are CW complexes, F is connected and B is simply connected; the general case involves more technicality (namely, local coefficient system).

S√©gur was the main home of these viscounts, in the heart of their domain. The viscounty went from the Limoges-S√©gur family to the House of Montfort in Brittany, then to the Albrets and eventually to the Bourbons.Coat of Arms of the ancient Viscounts of Limoges Territory Their territory included the castles of S√©gur, Excideuil, Aixe-su-Vienne, Auberoche and Nontron. South of Dalon Abbey, we find Hautefort, and south of Lubersac, we find Pompadour. Although the two Lastours strongholds belong to the \\"Limoges land princes\\" (princes de la terre limousine), they have less power than the viscount families : Limoges, Comborn, Turenne, Ventadour, Comborn, Aubusson, Rochechouart. S√©gur Castle Built in a shingle of the Auv√©z√®re River, at the borders of Saint-Eloi, Saint Julien, Payzac and Beyssenac parishes, the place is naturally defensive. The S√©gur \\"verteil\\" (headquarters of the milites castri, the knights who defend the castle) was home to the P√©russe family (future dukes of the Cars), Bonneval family (future marquises of Bonneval) (Claude Alexandre de Bonneval became a famous Ottoman Empire pasha), and Pr√©vot family (later \\"du Mas\\" family, future marquises of Paysac). The upper castle is in ruins. Today, the only remaining part is the P√©russe hotel, in the \\"verteil\\". No visits (December 2006) Excideuil Castle Only two large towers remain, joined together by a screen wall that used to be the aula pinion. The main home (16th or 17th century?) was doubled in width at the beginning of the 20th century. The outward gate of the milites castri's verteil is a Renaissance door. Aixe Castle A merovingian castrum was recorded as being at the confluence of the river. The Ch√¢teau d'Aixe (or \\"Tour Jeanne d'Albret\\") was constructed in the 13th century in Aixe-sur-Vienne, controlled by the viscounts of Limoges. It was demolished at the beginning of the 19th century. Thiviers CastleAuberoche Castle See Ch√¢teau d'Auberoche in the French Wikipedia for a detailed discussion (in French). Probably around 1037 or 1059, the successor of Bishop Frotaire (the castrum founder) is said to have submitted the place to the Limoges viscount, in order to get the protection of this laic potentate against the Count of P√©rigord. As soon as the last third of the 12th century (1154‚Äì1157), the Viscount of Limoges acknowledged the bishop of P√©rigueux as his suzerain, as far as Auberoche is concerned. By this submission, the viscount extended his domination up to the P√©rigord episcopal and county headquarters gates. Therefore, the viscounts of Limoges could maintain and use their political and economic power at the gates of P√©rigueux. The castle became a chaplain center which included 16 parishes (in 1365) and controlled two main, convergent traffic streams towards P√©rigueux city, through the Auv√©z√®re and Manoir valleys. Confirmed as soon as September 1257, the judicial and administrative power was enforced in the whole district area by a provost, the agent of the viscount of Limoges.

Another four locomotives of the M.36 class were manufactured at Eveleigh Railway Workshops in 1876-77 using re-built tenders from Locomotive No.1-4. Two of the class later had cab shelters fitted to the tenders for suburban running. Z18 Class An order was placed in February 1882, with the Vulcan Foundry for six 2-4-0T locomotives to the specification of the then Acting Locomotive Engineer, Mr Scott. During Mr Scott‚Äôs subsequent absence in England on official business, Thomas Middleton, Locomotive Engineer, had the specifications altered to 0-6-0T wheel arrangement, together with other variations to the original order. Middleton claimed that the revised design would enable the locomotives to run at in suburban service. Commissioner Goodchap approved the changes and despite the protests on Scott‚Äôs return, the variations were made. The six locomotives were delivered in 1884 and designated the 285 class. They became the (R) 285 class in 1889 and the Z18 class in 1924. Their driving wheels proved too small for the speed required and they were reduced to shunting duties in Sydney Yard, with just the occasional venture into the suburbs. In 1907 the locomotives were fitted with new domed boilers, replacing the domeless versions originally fitted. This increased their weight by 3 tons which improved their adhesion factor. Power reversing gear was fitted in 1922, making them the first class in New South Wales to be so fitted. It was a hydraulic type and was excellent when shunting at Sydney station, however this was only short lived and Johnson bar lever reversing gear was fitted shortly after. In 1927 following the release of other locomotives with the electrification of the Sydney suburban network, the class was transferred to locomotive depot work, some being fitted with cranes and renumbered into the (X)10 series. Later, with the cranes removed, they were restored to their Z18 numbers and worked at Port Kembla shunting. 1076 was an exception which continued to be known by that number. No. 1802 (originally R286) was sold to the Public Works Department in 1927 and became their No. 75. It continued in service until it was cut up for scrap metal in 1964.McCarthy 1983 Gazetteer of Industrial Steam Locomotives, Illawarra District 1801 and 1806 were sold to the Wallarah Coal Company in 1957 and worked on the isolated Catherine Hill Bay Coal Railway until the line ceased operation in December 1963.\\"The Wallarah Colliery Railway, Catherine Hill Bay\\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin issue 424 February 1973 pages 37/38 Image from the NSWGR Archives. F351 Class Originally ordered in 1879 but the order was stopped.Forsyth, J.H. (1974) \\"Steam Locomotive Data\\" A follow-up order in 1882 was made, the specification originally for 2-4-0 tank locomotives with 5'0\\" diameter driving wheels made by the acting locomotive engineer Mr Scott. During his absence in England on official business this was changed by Mr T. Middelton to an 0-6-0 type with 4'0\\" diameter driving wheels, claiming that such locomotives would be capable of 30-33 mph in service. Despite Scott's protests, Commissioner Goodchap approved the changes and six locomotives were designed and built by Vulcan Foundry. The subsequent 0-6-0 locomotives became the R(285) class, later the Z18 class.Grunbach, A (1989) \\"A Compendium of New South Wales Steam Locomotives\\" p. 74-75 In August 1884 Mr Scott informed the commissioner that more locomotives were required with the opening of the Illawarra extension. Mr Middelton wanted more of the R(285 class), but Mr Scott recommended his original proposed design from 1881. After much hesitation by the government, Beyer, Peacock and Company were asked to design and build the locomotives. These became the F(351) class and went into service on the Sydney suburban network in 1885-86, being numbered 351 to 362. In 1887 six more locomotives of this design (numbered 363 to 3680) were delivered by Henry Vale of Sydney. No. 366 featured in the Redfern collision of 1894. The design was extremely similar to a number of 2-4-0 tank locomotives supplied to the Isle of Wight Central Railway from 1864. A similar locomotive was delivered to the South Australian Railways from 1884 as their P-class.Grunbach, A (1989) \\"A Compendium of New South Wales Steam Locomotives\\" p. 85-86 Their running life came to an end in 1901 as a result of the findings on the Sydenham derailment involving No. 363 and the whole class was taken out of passenger work. The F351 class were known to oscillate and rock at high speeds and were officially limited to 30 mph. A factor in the Sydenham derailment was the driver exceeding the official speed limit. The locomotive was believed to be doing 51 mph when the accident occurred. The entire class was subsequently withdrawn from passenger work and allocated to various shunting, yard and depot duties. A number of the class were modified with a heavy cast iron front buffer beam in an attempt to stabilise the front of the locomotive after 1901.http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4807205 Between 1906 and 1929 ten of the class were sold to various private railway operators. All members of the class had been withdrawn from passenger work by 1914. Eleven were still on the books at this stage and were renumbered Lo.19-Lo.26 (Lo. Indicated that they were no longer in revenue-earning service). In 1924 they were renumbered in the X10 class, bearing numbers 1031-1033, 1035-1037 and 1039-1043.http://www.australiansteam.com/1076.htm From 1914, members of the class still in NSWGR service were rebuilt with the same domed boilers that replaced the dome-less type originally supplied on the R285 class. A number of other modifications were made to the class such as replacing the leaf spring on the front axle with twin coil springs. For reasons unknown 1033 at some stage had the original parallel buffers on the rear replaced with longer bottle-shaped Turton buffers. In 1966, 1036 with withdrawn and scrapped, but during an overhaul the boiler was given to 1076, previously numbered R288 then 1804. Three of the class were still in service with the NSWGR from 1940. 1033 at Eveleigh Railway Workshops, 1036 at Junee Locomotive Depot (withdrawn and scrapped in 1966) and 1042 at Cardiff Railway Workshops.1042 was given an overhaul as late as 1970 at the age of 83 years and continued working until February 1973,Oberg, L.

(1974) \\"Steam Locomotive Data\\" Z11 Class thumb The Z11 class (formerly the M40 class) was a class of steam locomotives built for the New South Wales Government Railways in Australia.New South Wales Railways 1855-1955. Published by Department of Railways Built by Beyer, Peacock and Company of Manchester, they entered suburban traffic in Sydney in 1891. They were primarily intended for use on the steeply-graded Strathfield-Hornsby and Milson's Point-Hornsby sections, hence their hefty weight which served to hinder them later in their careers. Because of this, they were never noted for spectacular performance. Between 1906 and 1910, they were rebuilt with Belpaire boilers. They were soon superseded by the S636 class 4-6-4Ts and were promptly used on Newcastle suburban services for a period. In 1924, all were renumbered as part of the Z11 Class. No. 50 was sold to Australian Iron & Steel Ltd., No. 51 to the South Maitland Railway, No. 1104 to the Nepean Sand & Gravel Company and No. 1111 to the Southern Portland Cement Company of Berrima. The remainder were sold for scrap between 1925 and 1927. None are preserved. Z13 Class Due to a shortage of suburban engines in the Sydney area and the availability of surplus C79 class tender engines, it was decided to experimentally convert one of the tender locomotives to a tank type engine in 1896. The conversion proved successful and twenty had been converted at Eveleigh Railway Workshops by 1902. In 1924 the class was renumbered becoming the Z13 class. Following the delivery of C30 class locomotives from 1903, they were transferred to Newcastle suburban traffic and when replaced there, were allocated minor roles such as working the Carlingford, Morpeth and Warren branches. Two were sold to East Greta Mining & Railway Company, one to Ashtonfields Colliery, Thornton and a fourth scrapped. In later years their main duties were working of the Ballina branch, the Picton-Mittagong Loop line, the Yass Town branch and school trains on the upper North Coast. C30 Class The first batch of 35 locomotives were built Beyer, Peacock and Company entering service in 1903/04. Between 1905 and 1917 Beyer, Peacock built a further 60 engines while the New South Wales Government Railways built 50 at their Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The electrification of the inner suburban lines resulted in a surplus of the class too valuable to scrap. Accordingly, between August 1928 and July 1933, 77 of these locomotives were converted to C30T tender 4-6-0 type locomotives by Clyde Engineering and Eveleigh Railway Workshops to replace older locomotives on country branch lines. The remaining tank locomotives were mostly employed on Sydney suburban services to Cowan, Penrith and Campbelltown as well as branches to Carlingford, Richmond and Camden.\\"Byways of Steam: Cowan to Hornsby\\" Roundhouse January 1985 page 14 They were also used on suburban services in Newcastle and Wollongong. A few drifted to the country areas, working on sections where no turntable was readily available, such as Casino to Border Loop on the North Coast line, Leeton and Merriwa and shunting at yards such as Bathurst. The daily passenger trains on the extremely steep Unanderra to Moss Vale line were operated by 30 class locomotives until February 1967. Following the electrification of the country platforms at Sydney Central station, the 30 class replaced the 26 class locomotives used to shunt carriages in the yard, they being not so dangerous to water under the traction wiring. The first was withdrawn in February 1957, by July 1965 the fleet was down to 33 and by mid-1971 down to three. The last, 3085, was withdrawn on 22 February 1973.‚Ä≥Steam Locomotive Data, John Forsyth, NSWPTC 1970, 1974Railway Digest March 1973 It was the second last steam locomotive in service on the NSWGR. Single-deck cars 1877 American Suburban Carriage Stock Main article: New South Wales American Suburban carriage stock The American Suburban Carriage were built between 1877 and 1912 by a number of manufacturers with timber frames and truss sided body work. Due to the truss bodywork, it was difficult to cut doors in the sides of the body so doors at either end of the cars were provided with covered platforms to allow access to the carriages. They became the most numerous group of carriages built for any Australian railway system with a total of 659 carriages built. A further 196 carriages, known as Lucy Suburban Carriages were constructed between 1913 and 1916 but had steel under frames and separate bodywork. While they retained the general layout and appearance of the American Suburban Carriage, they were generally not referred to as such and 193 were later completely rebuilt for use in Electric train stock in the 1920s. The American Suburban carriages were built primarily as suburban passenger carriages for the Sydney network. Following the electrification of the Sydney network in the 1920s and 1930s, most carriages were converted for use on longer distance services, whilst others were transferred to Newcastle and Wollongong for continued suburban service or to country branch lines. The last examples were withdrawn in the mid-1970s. A number of American Suburban carriages have been preserved. Examples are owned by the Canberra Railway Museum, Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum, Lachlan Valley Railway and New South Wales Rail Transport Museum. =1920 wooden single-deck cars= Bradfield motor car C3045 at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum in 2010 In the 1920s, the Bradfield electrification program began. Until then, trains continued to be sets of steam-locomotive-hauled wooden end-platform cars. In 1921, 101 wooden bodied driving-motor cars (later numbered C3000‚Äì3100) were built by Ritchie Brothers and Meadowbank Manufacturing Company C3045 (now preserved) was built by the railway workshops as a prototype, but became the very last to enter traffic in 1923. They were originally steam-hauled EBB/EFA cars, prior to conversion to electric traction with the opening of the first section of electrified line between Sydney and Oatley in 1926. These wooden cars had steel sheathing for additional strength, and became known as the Bradfield cars. Some Bradfield cars were converted to parcel vans after accidents. Other Bradfield cars were rebuilt to resemble Standard suburban (1927-type) cars in the 1960s, to prolong their lives until new double-deck cars could be delivered to replace them. The last Bradfield power-cars were withdrawn from service in 1975. C3045 is preserved static at the NSW Rail Museum, Thirlmere, while C3082 has been retained by RailCorp. C3082, the former Elcar \\"Pilot\\" Shunter, was used on a number of single-deck railfan tours in the 1980s, often with Wooden trailer car T4279. At the same time, 193 steam-hauled end-platform cars were rebuilt into 184 electric trailer cars (T4101‚Äì4284) and nine driving trailer cars (D4001 to 4009). They were in service much longer than intended, being finally replaced by the Tulloch single deck, and later double-deck, trailers from the 1950s onwards. D4001 and 4006 were converted to Parcel Vans driving trailers. T4279 is preserved and has been used on many railfan single-deck tours in the 1980s and early 1990s. D4004 is also preserved awaiting restoration, but not operable. Survey of Sydney Electric Trains, 1926‚Äì1960, Part 1. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March 2001 =1925 all-steel cars= With the planned opening of the Sydney underground lines and electrification, it was proposed to build steel bodied suburban cars. As no such cars were built in Australia before, an initial 50 cars (numbered 3101‚Äì3150) were built by the Leeds Forge Company in England and assembled at Eveleigh Carriage Workshops and Clyde Engineering between April and October 1925. Initially numbered 2213‚Äì2262, they entered service being inserted into sets with Bradfield carriages for haulage by steam locomotives until fitted with Metropolitan-Vickers electrical equipment and motors in 1926. At this stage they were renumbered C3101 to C3150.\\"Sydney's Electric Trains from 1926 to 1960\\" ARHS Bulletin issue 761 March 2001 pages 90-93C3104 - 1925 Leeds Forge Standard Motor Car Sydney Electric Traction Society =1926‚Äì1960 single-deck steel cars= Standard power car C7396 on set F1 at Central station Between 1926 and 1960, a total of 417 motor cars and 417 trailer cars were built by various contractors including Leeds Forge Company, Walsh Island Dockyard, Clyde Engineering, Tulloch Limited and Comeng. The pre-war \\"1927 type\\" cars were known as the \\"Standard\\" cars as they dominated the suburban fleet, and featured First and Second Class travel until 1 January 1940. More cars (the majority being trailer cars), were delivered by Tulloch Limited between 1940 and 1957 to cater for system expansion, and to replace many of the decrepit Wooden trailer cars. The 80 cars built by Comeng from 1957 to 1960 (40 motor and 40 trailer cars) became known as the Sputnik cars. They had 4 single power operated doors on each side and were of spot-welded construction.The Sputnik Cars SETS Library These cars were introduced at the time of electrification extension from Parramatta to Penrith. One 8-car set of Tulloch cars was fitted with power-doors and ran from 1956 to 1976 as set F39. Between 1968 & 1973, 97 Standard & Tulloch motor-cars were converted from two to four motors on new air-ride bogies for better performance and adhesion, starting with C7500 (ex C3500). These single deck electric multiple unit (EMU) sets were the backbone of the Sydney suburban network until the stainless-steel double deck cars of the S (and later C, K & R) sets took over. The last of the Sputniks had their final retirement in 1993. Many cars were painted blue & white during the PTC years from 1972 onwards, and the last blue & white cars were repainted in 1987. Several cars were fitted with Beclawat sliding windows during overhauls as a cost-cutting measure (see photo). After 1976, they carried a deep 'Indian Red' livery until their retirement. In 1991, one eight-car set H22 was painted in a special livery to promote Taronga Zoo. Two power-door W-sets were painted in special liveries for the Zoo (W1) and to mark Sydney's Sesqicentenary (W2). Many of the motor cars were marshalled with the Tulloch double deck trailer cars (see below) to form 4 or 8 car mixed single and double deck sets.Survey of Sydney Electric Trains, 1926‚Äì1960, Part 2. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, May 2001 In their final years, these cars became associated with the term 'red rattlers' by the State Government and the media, due to the way the windows and window shutters rattled in their frames. On 10 June 2016, Preserved cars C7396, T4527, C3218 and C3426 were returned to operational status by Sydney Trains in conjunction with Historic Electric Traction. This train set, now known as Red Set F1, operates occasional special passenger trips through Transport Heritage NSW. At 90 years of age, Set F1 is now among the oldest fully operating electric train sets in the world. Double-deck cars1964 Tulloch double-deck trailers (1964‚Äì2003)= Tulloch trailer car T4873 forming part of a S set In the 1960s, tenders were called for double-deck electric passenger cars. In 1964, the first of 120 Tulloch trailers were delivered,The Double-Deck Suburban Cars Singleton, C.C. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, June, 1964 pp. 101‚Äì06 and integrated into the single-deck sets. The cars were built by Tulloch Limited, and were numbered 4801‚Äì4920, by operating across only the City Circle, South, Bankstown, East Hills and Inner West Lines (Sector 2). They consisted of normal floor level over the bogies, with a double deck passenger section between the bogies. The cars were largely riveted aluminium, with steel underframes. They carried green internal livery and were painted Tuscan Red on the outside sides with painted silver roofs to match the single deck carriages. For the first time in Sydney, fluorescent internal lighting and air suspension bogies were used. The initial 40 cars were used in power door sets, the remainder in non-powered door sets, and they replaced the remaining wooden bodied trailer cars. In 1987, W-set trailers T4834‚Äì4838 were converted to manual door M-set cars by having their power-doors disconnected, and rewired from 120- to 32-volt operation. The Tullochs were painted in the colour scheme of the day (blue & white and later deep Indian red). Cars T4839 to 4895 were later painted grey and marshalled into sets containing Comeng & Goninan double-deck cars (see below) as 'R & S sets'. Cars T4834‚Äì4838 and 4896‚Äì4920 continued to operate with older single-deck motor cars as 'M Sets'. The W set trailers (T4801‚Äì4833) and M set trailers (T4834‚Äì4838 and 4896‚Äì4920) were withdrawn in 1994 with the retirement of all single deck suburban stock, the cars marshalled with Comeng power cars in W sets saw service until February 2004, before the introduction of the Millennium Trains. Cars 4801, 4814, 4840, 4843, 4844, 4849, 4850 4854, 4874, 4881, 4799 have been kept for preservation. =1968 prototype double-deck power cars (1968‚Äì1980)= Prototype double- deck power car C3804 In 1966, after the success of the Tulloch double-deck trailers, tenders were called for double deck motor cars. In 1968, four experimental double-deck motor cars (C3801‚Äì3804) were built by Tulloch and entered serviceNew Double Deck Suburban Electric Power Cars Calf, H.R. Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April, 1969 pp87-91 enabling the first eight-car double-deck train, set S10, to operate by marshalling them with four Tulloch trailers T4839, 4840, 4843 and 4844. These were the first fully double-deck Electric Multiple Unit passenger trains in the world that had seating on both the upper and the lower level. Each power-car carried electrical equipment from different manufacturers for evaluation purposes: C3801 (Mitsubishi), 3802 (Toshiba), 3803 (Hitachi) and 3804 (English Electric). Set S10 proved unreliableSydney's First Double Deck Train Moss, Geoff Australian Railway History, December, 2007 pp. 451‚Äì59 and the single- deck \\"Sputnik\\" C3701-series power-cars often deputised for Tulloch power cars out of service. In 1977, it was decided to disband the set to convert them to trailers. C3801 was converted to T4797 in 1980 and C3803 became T4799 in 1982. Conversion of C3802 to T4798 was started at Elcar Workshops, but never finished and it was later scrapped. C3804 is now preserved at the NSW Rail Museum, Thirlmere. It was withdrawn from service on 4 January 1980. These trailers operated on the: * South Line ‚Äì City Circle to Macarthur via Granville * Inner West Line ‚Äì City Circle to Liverpool via Regents Park * Bankstown Line ‚Äì City Circle to Liverpool via Bankstown * East Hills Line ‚Äì City Circle to Macarthur via Sydenham (then via Airport Line in 2000‚Äì2003) =1972 Comeng power cars= Comeng S set power car in CityRail livery with destination board In 1972, the first Comeng-constructed stainless steel double deck power-cars entered service. These cars (C3805‚Äì3857) were loosely based on the recently introduced inter-urban cars, the V set. Their stainless- steel bodies were painted the standard \\"Tuscan red\\" to match the livery of the existing fleet. Cars C3844‚Äì3857 were delivered in the blue and white livery of the Public Transport Commission in the 1970s, and repainted to deep Indian red after 1976, before being paint-stripped to run in their original stainless steel finish in the early 1980s. They were initially marshalled into sets (from S11 onwards) with Tulloch trailers T4841, 4842, and 4845 to 4895, which had their passenger doors modified from manual to power operation. Internally, they had reversible seating with a light-tan upholstery, and a grey and off- white internal livery. Beclawat sliding windows were fitted to the upper and lower decks, with drop windows in the doors. The sliding windows were replaced with Hopper windows in the 1990s and internally they were repainted light grey with blue upholstered seating. These motor cars had tapered ends, which were fitted with destination boards in the 1990s. With the introduction of the Millennium Trains in 2002, several early Comeng power-cars were converted to non-driving trailers, with their pantographs removed, and renumbered T4701‚Äì4723. =1973 Comeng power and trailer cars= In 1973, additional 54 Comeng power cars C3858 ‚Äì 3911, and 56 Comeng trailer cars T4921 ‚Äì 4962, were ordered to coincide with the opening of the Eastern suburbs railway line. These trailer cars were the first to be of stainless steel construction, and they had an extra row of seats on the top deck (and are thus distinguished by an extra single window at the centre of the car on both decks). Ten driving trailers D4011 ‚Äì 4020 were built with small driver's compartments for 2-car trains. However, they never saw service as driving cars due to Union bans. Subsequently, 25 driving trailer cars D4021 ‚Äì 4045 (with large guard's compartments) were also built to be paired with a driving motor car to allow 2-car sets to be operated. Ten driving trailers were diesel hauled on South Coast suburban services, south of Thirroul, prior to electrification. Ten driving trailers, renumbered D4001 ‚Äì 4010, were used for two car shuttles in the initial period after the electrification of the Richmond line. These driving trailer cars subsequently had their driving equipment removed and were converted into standard non-driving trailer cars.Sydney Suburban Fleet, Part 2. Railway Digest, July 2002 Extended orders saw the Comeng double-deck fleet expanded to include power-cars C3912‚Äì3986 & 3741‚Äì3765, trailers T4963‚Äì4987 and driving trailers D4046‚Äì4095 by 1982. By 1976, one quarter of suburban cars were double deck. All the 1973 cars are now integrated with earlier stock and operate as L, R & S Sets. With the introduction of the Millennium Trains in 2002, several early Comeng power-cars were converted to non-driving trailers, with their pantographs removed, and renumbered T4701‚Äì4723. =1978 Goninan cars= A Comeng-built S Set led by power car C3765In the 1970s, A Goninan & Co in Newcastle entered the passenger car construction market building 80 power cars C3001 ‚Äì 3080 and 70 trailer cars T4101 ‚Äì 4170. Unlike the Comeng cars, the power cars had a flat front end and Pullman Standard fluting, and the upper deck passenger windows were set significantly lower than the earlier Comeng cars reducing passenger sight lines (a source of complaint from passengers). When the Eastern Suburbs Railway was opened in 1979, only stainless-steel Comeng or Goninan double deck cars were meant to operate on this line, but the painted Tulloch double-deck trailers were also used. In 1981, a brand new four-car Goninan set conveyed Queen Elizabeth II from Bankstown (which was declared a City by the Queen) to Martin Place. For this occasion the train was specially fitted out with carpets and other refinements. The set was targeted \\"R1\\" for the occasion. These cars continue to operate in 2007 as L, R and S sets. They were the last non-air conditioned passenger trains in service in Sydney. Two thirds of pre-1981 non-air conditioned rolling stock were withdrawn from service with the roll-out of 626 new A set Waratah carriages (78 sets) from 2012 to June 2014. The final sets were scheduled to be withdrawn from service by 2015 but some sets were retained for the South West Rail link since no newer rollingstock or additional Waratah trains had been ordered. In December 2016, the NSW Government announced a plan to introduce 192 new Waratah carriages also known as the Sydney Trains B sets. These have replaced the remaining non- airconditioned S set trains by the end of June 2019  Current suburban passenger rolling stock = 1981 Goninan power and trailer cars  Sydney Trains K set at Strathfield station In 1981, Goninan built the first air- conditioned cars for the Sydney suburban network. Until then, Sydney had lagged somewhat behind other cities that had commenced the introduction of air-conditioned stock. In order to fit the air-conditioning equipment into the motor cars, the pantographs were moved to the trailers, effectively meaning that a motor car must remain semi-permanently coupled to a trailer car. Four driving trailer cars D4096‚Äì4099 were also ordered, allowing 2-car sets to be operated with power cars C3501‚Äì3504. The first 8-car set (R1) was delivered with air-conditioning, followed by 90 forced ventilation cars C3505‚Äì3549 & T4171‚Äì4215, during the delivery process for this order, C3550 and T4216 were delivered, fully fitted with air-conditioning. Following this, the next order, numbered from C3551 and T4217, were also fitted with forced-air ventilation, and were the first to be fitted with air-conditioning. The first 100 cars had their upper deck windows at the unpopular lower height of the earlier Goninan cars, the final 60 were modified and these final 60 were distinguished by their front end being painted into the 'candy' white, orange and red State Rail livery of the time. The final batch (C3551-3580 & T4217-4246) also featured bright yellow internal walls. The forced ventilation cars were later retrofitted with air-conditioning, and the Beclawat sliding windows replaced by fixed panes in the late 1990s. Also at this time, the standard light grey internal livery was adopted, and the seats were replaced with blue upholstery.Sydney Suburban Fleet, Part 3. Railway Digest September 2002 160 of these cars were delivered until 1985, and continue to operate in 2011 as K sets.  1985 Goninan cars  C set at Campsie railway station In 1985, a new generation of advanced suburban passenger train was being considered by the State Rail Authority. There was a delay in the construction of these trains, and 56 interim stainless steel air conditioned cars, C3581‚Äì3608 and T4247‚Äì4274, were built by Goninan, known as the 'Chopper Cars' for their chopper control. These cars trialled several features of the next generation cars, such as fixed seating, door chimes and passenger address systems. They were originally fitted with a push-button feature, to enable passengers to open the doors manually, but this feature was short-lived. They retained the flat ends of the previous Goninan cars, but with the addition of a fibreglass moulded end piece which was originally white with orange and red stripes (the 'candy' State Rail livery). These ends were later painted grey with a lower yellow section which they retain to this day, and internally the standard grey livery and blue seat upholstery was applied. These cars continue to operate as C sets.  Tangaras  T set Tangara with Sydney Trains livery In 1988, the \\"third generation\\" train, called Tangara ‚Äì an aboriginal word meaning \\"to go\\", was introduced. This train marked a radical departure from the previous double deck car design both in appearance and technically. The Tangara is the last publicly funded electric rolling stock built for CityRail ‚Äì all future electric trains are being built and operated under public‚Äìprivate partnership agreements. A total of 450 T set cars were introduced between 1988 and 1994, allowing the withdrawal of the remaining single deck suburban passenger cars in 1993. Eighty G set cars featuring toilets, high-backed reversible seating and passenger door opening controls were built between 1994 and 1996. These generally operated on outer-suburban runs, typically to Wollongong, Springwood and Gosford, though they also sometimes operated in suburban service. These outer-suburban sets allowed the retirement of the last remaining single-deck U sets in 1996. One set, G7, was experimentally fitted with dual-voltage A/C traction. This set was extensively damaged in the Waterfall rail accident in January 2003 and scrapped after completion of the coronial inquiry into the accident. In 2010, a refurbishment program began for all Tangaras, which were by then nearly 20 years old and showing signs of wear and tear. This work involved reupholstered seats, new flooring and handrails, relocated end saloon partitions and a complete internal repaint. Inter-car doors and handrails are repainted yellow, and the interiors share common fittings with the Millennium and OSCAR cars. The former outer-suburban G sets have been retargeted as T sets from T101 onwards and the cars recoded from OD, ON and ONL to the suburban D & N codings, retaining the same 58xx and 68xx number series. The former ONL cars have had their toilet and water cooler removed and replaced with longitudinal seating, but without the luggage racks found elsewhere in these cars.  Millenniums  Sydney Trains M set at Central From 2002, 140 \\"fourth generation\\" carriages were introduced, known as Millennium trains or M sets. These trains allowed the withdrawal of the Tulloch trailer cars. These were the first passenger trains in NSW to introduce automatic passenger information displays and announcements. The design of the M sets formed the basis for the design of H sets and A sets. These trains are maintained by Downer Rail at the Auburn Maintenance Centre. While the Millennium trains are suitable for division into four-car sets, they are normally kept coupled as eight-cars sets at all times.  Waratahs  Waratah approaching Flemington Station The Waratah sets (also called A sets) are a double-decker, air- conditioned train based on the Millennium train, the order being for 78 sets of eight cars per train. The body shells were constructed in China and completed at Newcastle, New South Wales by a joint venture between the NSW Government, Downer Rail, and other companies under a public‚Äìprivate partnership, with delivery between 2011 and 2014 to replace the now withdrawn 6-8 car R & S Set trains. The first set went into regular service on 1 July 2011 on the Macarthur‚ÄìEast Hills‚ÄìAirport line with the last set delivered by mid-2014. The New South Wales Government announced on 1 December 2016 that 24 new suburban trains had been ordered. Known as the Sydney Growth Trains during development, the trains are officially classified as B sets and are also known as Waratah Series 2 trains. The $1.7 billion contract was awarded to Downer EDI. CRRC Changchun Railway Vehicles manufactured and delivered the bodies of the trains to Downer EDI, which assembled them. More than 90 percent of the design is shared with the original Waratahs. The first B set was unveiled in Auburn in March 2018. After undergoing months of testing, Set B2 was the first to enter revenue service on 7 September 2018. The B sets replaced the remaining S sets by the end of June 2019. In February 2019, a further 17 B sets were ordered with deliveries to start in September 2020, but due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the trains are likely to enter service in 2021.Sydney's stretched rail network in store for $900m in new trains Sydney Morning Herald 6 February 2019.Alstom Metropolis at Chatswood Station  Sydney Metro rolling stock =Alstom Metropolis TS sets 22 Sydney Metro Alstom Metropolis 6-car sets entered into service when the Sydney Metro opened in May 2019. Former inter-urban passenger rolling stock= U set Electric Multiple Units  U set driving car. The initial 80 electric interurban passenger cars (40 \\"CF\\" power cars 5001‚Äì5040, 20 \\"TF\\" trailer cars 6001‚Äì6020 and 20 \\"ETB\\" trailer cars 6021‚Äì6040) were introduced from 1958 to coincide with the electrification of the Blue Mountains line to Bowenfels. These trains were similar in external appearance to the single deck steel suburban cars but were slightly narrower (for 2+2 across seating), built of unpainted stainless steel and corridor connectors between the cars. These trains carried a 'U' target plate, and became affectionately known as 'U Boats'. They featured First and Second Class accommodation until 1974, when they became \\"one class\\". First Class (in the ETB trailers) was identifiable by blue covered seats (as opposed to green seats in second class), carpet on the floor and ashtrays in the smoking section. Their operational sphere spread from Lithgow/Bowenfels and Gosford to include Port Kembla, Dapto and Newcastle until their final demise in 1996. They have been used on many railfan tours since the 1960s, sometimes loco-hauled outside the electrified area. Three power cars and two trailer cars have been preserved by the Sydney Electric Train Society. Other U-boat cars have been preserved privately, and many sold to private buyers for a variety of uses after withdrawal.  620/720-class diesel rail motors  620/720 class railcar at Newcastle Eighteen two-car self-propelled 620/720 class railcars were introduced between 1961 and 1968, constructed at the New South Wales Government Railways' Chullora Railway Workshops. They were the final passenger railcars to be built by government workshops in NSW.Eade, W. 620/720: The Great Survivors. Railway Digest, November 2003 They were based on the 600/700 and 900/800 class railcars and were built for Newcastle suburban and regional workings, although they saw service on Wollongong services before electrification, and rural services to Cowra, Mudgee, Grafton and Murwillumbah.Walters, C The Survivors: The 620 Class. Australian Railway History, March, 2007 Three sets were built with first and second class accommodation and were used for country services, the remainder were single- class only (originally designated second class). They have served the non- electrified and pre-electrified sections of the Sydney suburban and outer- suburban (interurban) passenger networks ‚Äì they saw service on the Richmond line until completion of electrification works in the 1990s. After the removal of many country services and the electrification of the South Coast Line in 1985 and the Richmond line in the 1990s, they saw service on the Far South Coast line and the Southern Highlands line. At introduction, they were painted tuscan red. From the 1970s, some carried an Indian red livery. In 1980, some were painted in a reverse livery with yellow front ends. From 1982 the 'candy' livery of bright red, with orange, yellow and white trims was introduced system-wide and the 620/720 class were no exception. In the 1990s, they were repainted from 'candy' into a 'heritage' livery reminiscent of the former tuscan paint scheme, before adopting a grey and blue corporate CityRail livery in the 2000s. After the introduction of the Endeavour railcars in 1994, their numbers were reduced to seven two-car sets, and they were all withdrawn from service during 2007. Several of these sets have been preserved, with 621/721 repainted into 1960s deep Indian red livery with buff lining by the Rail Motor Society. This set has already seen use on enthusiast tours. At least one other set is under restoration to original external and internal condition.  SMR Railmotors  The South Maitland Railways railcar was a class of diesel railcar built by Tulloch Limited for the South Maitland Railway (SMR) in 1961. Having had all of carriages destroyed by a fire in March 1930, the SMR arranged for services to be operated by the New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR). However, with the service running at a considerable loss, the SMR sought to reduce costs by introducing diesel railcars.\\"When Diesels came to the South Maitland RailwaysAustralian Railway History April 2007 In September 1958 Tulloch Limited to answer an enquiry from the SMR for diesel railcars submitted a 65-page proposal document to SMR. As a result of this proposal SMR also approached Commonwealth Engineering for a request for a tender. In 1959 an order was placed with Tulloch Limited with all delivered for services to commence on 1 October 1961.\\"Contracts & Tenders\\" Railway Gazette 27 November 1959 page 496 Tulloch developed the design for the railcars with the assistance of Tube Investments of England whom Tulloch had had a technical assistance agreement since 1959. The car bodies and underframes were of mild steel construction. Upon completion the railcars were tested on the NSWGR network in the Sydney region, travelling as far as Penrith. Railcar No.1 was delivered to East Greta Junction on 26 April, followed by No.2 on 2 June and No.3 on 14 July. They operated all services on the line from Cessnock to Maitland except for the daily Cessnock Express to Sydney which continued to be operated by the NSWGR. All were painted royal blue and yellow. The original timetable provided services throughout the day, seven days a week. In May 1965, Saturday afternoon and all Sunday services were cancelled while off-peak services on weekdays were reduced to three in the morning and three in the afternoon. In January 1967 all SMR operated passenger services were cancelled and the railcars withdrawn and placed in store at East Greta with a replacement Rover Motors bus service to Newcastle introduced.Our History Rover Coaches The through NSWGR operated services continued until May 1972. After attempts by SMR to sell the Tulloch railcars failed, they were scrapped in 1977.  1100 \\"Budd\\" railmotors  The 1100 class railcar or Budd railcar are a type of diesel railcar built by Commonwealth Engineering for the New South Wales Government Railways in 1961. They primarily operated on the South Coast Daylight Express until withdrawn in 1993.  1200 Tulloch railmotors  In 1968, an order was placed with Tulloch Limited for 10 railcars for the Riverina Express with the fleet delivered between October 1970 and May 1972. While awaiting delivery of sufficient cars to operate the service, some were used on Goulburn Day Train and South Coast Daylight Express services in company with the 1100 class railcars. In addition, two vehicles were also constructed for Victorian Railways as their DRC Class. The ten cars were built in two configurations, one with a buffet section and seating for 8 First class and 36 Second Class (numbered PCR 1201-1203) and the other seating 18 First Class, 36 Second Class and a separate luggage compartment (numbered PCH 1221-1227). The objective was to provide two four-car trains, each consisting of one PCR and three PCH along with one spare car of each type. They entered service on the Riverina Express in May 1972. The purpose of forming the trains with individual railcars was to allow it to divide at major stations along the route where cars detached for Cowra, Tumut, Lake Cargelligo and Hillston on selected days, as well as the traditional destinations of Griffith and Albury. On the return journey, the cars amalgamated again to form a single train back to Sydney. The 1200s soon began to suffer equipment failures, particularly with their complex electrical system, especially when amalgamating. Following one car suffering a distorted engine support frame all were withdrawn in January 1973. The damaged car became an office. One set of four was returned to operate the service three days a week with locomotive hauled and later DEB sets operating it on the other days. This remaining cars were withdrawn in October 1975 when a second DEB set was transferred. In May 1974, two cars (PCH 1224 and PCH 1227) were sold to Victorian Railways to complement the two DRC railcars it had purchased new. In 1977 four were converted to operate an exhibition train around New South Wales for the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II. Three more were pooled with the 1100 class railcars on Illawarra line services while the car with a damaged engine frame became an office. In 1981 it was decided to convert the latter and two of the Jubilee cars into loco hauled cars, the remaining five were similarly treated in 1983. They were placed in service on the Illawarra line between Sydney and Bomaderry. They did occasionally stray operating both the Canberra Express and Newcastle Flyer in January 1986.\\"Southern and Illawarra Report\\" Railway Digest March 1986 page 84\\"Newcastle and Short North Report\\" Railway Digest March 1986 page 87 Following the cessation of locomotive hauled South Coast services in January 1991, they were redeployed to operate services on the Main South line to Moss Vale and Goulburn.\\"South Coast timetable\\" Railway Digest April 1991 page 114 In February 1993, six of the carriages were given a light refurbishment before being withdrawn in November 1993.\\"1200 Class Tulloch Cars\\" Railway Digest May 1993 page 206\\"Loco- Hauled Car Changes\\" Railway Digest February 1994 page 36 In August 1994, six were auctioned.\\"Rolling Stock - Carriage Auction Results\\" Railway Digest October 1994 page 38 Current inter-urban rolling stock= V Set  V set in 2013 NSW TrainLink Livery Introduced from 1970, these double deck interurban cars actually predated the first full suburban double deck sets. Described at the time as the 'most luxurious commuter stock in the world',NSW Double-Deck Interurbans Turn 30, Railway Digest, June 2000 they set new benchmarks for passenger comfort in Sydney. Initial service was confined to the Central Coast & Newcastle Line until they were usable on the Blue Mountains Line after the Glenbrook tunnel was widened in 1975. They could proceed as far as Lithgow after the Lithgow tunnels were widened in 1979. Services began on the Illawarra line after electrification in 1985. Initially these sets carried 'U' target plates. The subsequent orders of double-deck cars carried 'V' plates to designate sets fitted with vacuum toilets. The original 1970 cars were not a success, and they were rebuilt into trailers to run with the later-series intercity cars in the early 1980s. These later cars can be identified by seating with plastic orange surrounds, and they lack a door between the passenger compartment and the small entry/exit area. The second series of the V-Sets (DCM/DM) commenced being phased out in early 2011, to be replaced by the Oscar. When NSW TrainLink was established in 2013 the V sets were subject to refurbishment program involving the repainting and refitting the interior and new exterior livery.\\"NSW Trainlink to deliver dedicated service for Intercity and Regional customers\\" Transport for NSW, 1 July 2013 The rest of the V sets are expected to begin being replaced by 2024 when the D sets are introduced. OSCAR H set H sets (OSCARs, an acronym for Outer-Suburban CARs), were launched on 24 April 2006. The H sets were principally built to replace the G set Tangaras on outer-suburban services and the original order of V sets. They feature identical reversible seating to Hunter railcars, and one disabled toilet per four-car set, whilst the vestibules feature longitudinal seating and ceiling hand-grips. They run to Newcastle Interchange, Port Kembla and Kiama. These cars were built by UGL Rail. When the D sets are introduced, the H sets will also be displaced and moved onto the Sydney Trains suburban network.  Single Deck Interurban Cars Endeavour railcars An Endeavour set in the NSW TrainLink livery 28 Endeavour diesel railcars were introduced from 1994 to operate the non- electrified CityRail lines to replace the ageing DEB railcars and some of the 620/720 class railcars. They currently operate on the Southern Highlands line, the Illawarra line between Kiama and Bomaderry, the Bathurst Bullet on the Main Western line and the Hunter line. They previously operated weekend service on the Moss Vale ‚Äì Unanderra line. They operate as two or four-car sets. Several cars were converted into Xplorers, which they are technically and mechanically identical to. Hunter railcars New South Wales Hunter railcar In 2006, 14 Hunter diesel railcars were ordered to replace 620/720 class railcars. They are a new type of diesel multiple unit used on the Hunter Valley lines centred on Newcastle. The Hunter railcars were built by United Goninan and are sharing Newcastle to Maitland, Telarah and Dungog regional services with Endeavour railcars. The design is derived from the new generation Transwa Prospector, except that the lower top speed requirement for the Hunter railway line means that the driving cars are each single-engined instead of dual-engined. Former rural passenger rolling stock= CPH (Tin Hare) railmotors  CPH12 railmotor at Wagga Wagga station The CPH railmotors were introduced from 1923 to provide feeder services on country branch lines. They operated many branch line services in the south of the state until their widespread withdrawal in 1974.Banger, C. The Intercapital Daylight, 1956‚Äì1991 Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, Vol 52 No. 764. June 2001 They also provided pre-electrification service on the Richmond line, late night Clyde ‚Äì Carlingford shuttles, Sutherland ‚Äì Waterfall on the Illawarra line and Pippita & State Abattoirs line in suburban Sydney until they were officially withdrawn with the 27 November 1983 timetable. A handful of CPH railmotors worked Wollongong suburban services for some months afterwards. Many of these veteran rail motors are preserved and still operational. Following the failure of 620 railcars to fit through the Fernleigh tunnel, the CPH railmotors also provided passenger service from Newcastle to Belmont. Creamy Kate and Trailer JuneeAfter an accident at Bowning, in which several passenger cars were damaged, two underframes were salvaged. Around the two underframes, a two-engine railmotor and attendant trailer were constructed. The motor car was allocated number CHP38 and the trailer 81. It spent most of its days on branch lines out of Narrandera. Trailer 81 was ultimately rebuilt and renumbered FT551 and worked Sutherland to Waterfall shuttles with conventional CPH railmotors until electrification in July 1980.Rail Motor 38 and Trailer 551 ‚Äì The 55ft.

Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March, 1971 pp66-72  1935 S type carriages  Between 1935 and 1937 Clyde Engineering built 35 first class BS carriages with 42 seats and 86 second class FS side corridor carriages with 64 seats at its Granville factory.\\"Carriage Review\\" Railway Digest December 1986 page 394 Over the years they operated on services from express passenger and mail trains to branch line services. Withdrawals commenced in the 1970s but some lasted until the late 1980s on mail trains to Dubbo, Moree and Tenterfield and Interurban services to Newcastle, Bathurst, Goulburn and Bomaderry. During the period spanning 1974 to 1982 eight were gutted internally and fitted with suburban throw over seating and Beclawat windows for use on interurban services. These received the IFS and MFS classifications. As at June 1986, 32 remained in service with the State Rail Authority.\\"Carriage Review\\" Railway Digest November 1986 page 351 Silver City Comet The Silver City Comet at Central, 1937 These self-propelled diesel passenger trains were introduced in 1937 and operated between Parkes and Broken Hill. During World War II, they were also used on some intercity runs from Sydney to Canberra and Newcastle. Together with Victorian Railways' \\"Spirit of Progress\\", it was the first air-conditioned train in the British Empire. When introduced, it was originally painted silver, to reflect the harsh heat of the western plains. After World War II, Silver City Comet sets were repainted in standard NSWGR tuscan & russet, then Indian red liveries. Prior to the 50th anniversary of the Silver City Comet in 1987, it reverted to the original silver livery. The Silver City Comets were withdrawn in 1989. The majority of the remaining Silver City Comet fleet has been preserved in static condition.  FP Paybus  The FP paybuses were a series of thirteen small 4 wheel railbuses built for the Department of Railways New South Wales between 1937 and 1970. The rail buses were intended for use on branch lines whose low passenger numbers did not warrant the use of a larger railmotor.  1939 N type carriages  In September 1938 the Department of Railways New South Wales awarded a contract to Waddington, Granville for 35 steel carriages. They were equipped with forced air ventilation and downward opening windows. Neither were successful and were replaced by more conventional fittings.\\"Carriage Review\\" Railway Digest December 1986 page 393 The cars were delivered as 5 NUB sets of seven cars, normally marshalled as HFN, FN, FN, BN, BN, FN and HFN. Car numbers were 2177-2211 and the cars being numbered sequentially within each set. The BN cars were first class cars and sat 56 passengers in seven semi-partitioned sections. The FN cars were second class cars and could seat 78 passengers. The HFN cars were second class brake vans and could seat 68 passengers. In May 1944 they were placed on the Newcastle Flyer services until replaced by HUB sets from 1948. They were also used on the Cessnock Express. By 1969 five cars were modified from FN to RFN to provide additional buffets for the NSWGR fleet. The modified cars were three tons lighter and had a capacity of 47 passengers.1969 General Appendix, Department of Railways, New South Wales, page 445 A number were modified to BAM sleeper cars for use on longer distance trains which allowed retirement of a number of the older TAM type sleepers. Over the years they operated on both express passenger and mail train services. In May 1968 some were converted for use on the Brisbane via Wallangarra service while in June 1970 others were modified for use on the Southern Highlands Express.\\"20 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest May 1988 page 190\\"20 Years Ago\\" Railway Digest June 1990 page 230 They were withdrawn in the late 1980s following the cessation of the Northern and Western Mails.  400/500 class Railmotor  The 400 & 500 Class rail motors are diesel trains built by New South Wales Government Railways primarily for use on regional lines throughout NSW. The trains have since been phased out following a rationalisation of country branch line rail services in November 1983. The 400 Class power cars were built in 1938 at the Eveleigh Carriage Workshops, while the 500 Class trailer cars were built by Ritchie Brothers at Auburn.  1948 HUB set carriages  The HUB set cars were ordered by the Department of Railways New South Wales in 1943 to operate services from Sydney to Newcastle. Originally the contract was for an additional 25 N type carriages, but due to wartime restrictions construction was delayed and the contract was amended with the carriages being altered to air conditioned and an additional 3 cars added to the order. The contract was awarded to Tulloch Limited, Rhodes who built the 28 carriages numbered 2212 to 2239 between 1947 and 1949, and formed into four sets of seven carriages. Each carriage was 19.83 metres in length.\\"Countrylink's 'new' Daylight Express cars\\" Railway Digest February 1996 page 40 The cars consisted of: * eight first class cars coded BH * four first class with buffet coded RBH * four second class coded FH * four second class with buffet coded RFH * four second class with guard coded HFH * four second class cars with power generating equipment coded PFH. The 4 sets coded HUB were numbered 116-119, with each set originally consisting of HFH, RFH, BH, BH, RBH, FH and PFH. The first set entered service in April 1948 on the Newcastle Flyer. One briefly operated the Riverina Express before being transferred to the South Coast Daylight Express and them in 1956 to the Central West Express to Orange. From the 1970s, the HUB sets ceased operating as fixed formations and the carriages were operated with RUB and stainless steel rolling stock on services throughout the state.Rdh 2220 - Coaching stock - Unclassed/Buffet Car Department of Environment & HeritageRdh 2233 - Buffet/Daynighter Saloon Car Department of Environment & Heritage They ceased operating the Newcastle Flyer services in April 1988\\"The End of the Flyers\\" Railway Digest June 1988 page 215 and many were withdrawn as a number of locomotive hauled services ceased in the early 1990s. Some remained in service with CityRail on Southern Highlands services to Goulburn until replaced by Endeavour railcars in 1994. Most were auctioned in August 1994 with the State Rail Authority retaining five.\\"Rolling Stock - Carriage Auction Results\\" Railway Digest October 1994 page 38 In 1996 three were returned to traffic for use on CountryLink's new services to Broken Hill and Griffith before being withdrawn in April 2000.\\"CountryLink Loco-Hauled Services Cancelled\\" Railway Digest May 2000 page 7  600/700 Railmotor  The 600/700 class railcars were a class of Diesel Multiple Unit built by the New South Wales Government Railways. They were built to operate on branch lines from 1949 with low traffic volumes later being transferred to Newcastle and Wollongong to operate suburban services until withdrawn in 1994. However, one 600 class railcar was converted to solar operation for use on the Byron Bay Train service. The upgraded train entered service on 16 December 2017 and is believed to be the world's first solar-powered train.  1949 RUB set carriages  The RUB type carriage stock was a type of steel bodied air conditioned passenger carriage operated by the New South Wales Government Railways from September 1949 until April 2000. 900/800 class diesel rail motors From 1955 until 1990, air- conditioned 800/900 class trains, known as DEB sets, provided service to Canberra as the Canberra Monaro Express, replacing the steam hauled Federal City Express. The DEB sets were also used on some South Coast Line and Southern Highlands Line commuter services until they were replaced by Endeavour railcars in 1994.  1961 Stainless Steel carriages  The New South Wales stainless steel carriage stock was a type of passenger carriage operated by the New South Wales Government Railways from 1961 until 1993. These carriages were mainly used on interstate trains such as the Southern Aurora, which ran between Sydney and Melbourne, its slower counterpart the Spirit of Progress and the Brisbane Limited. They were also used on the Gold Coast Motorail to Murwillumbah. With the demise of locomotive-hauled trains, the majority of the carriages passed to the Australian Railway Historical Society, Canberra and New South Wales Rail Transport Museum who have maintained them in operational condition. The latter often operates them on tours under the Southern Aurora banner.Awake in a New World Heritage Express  Current rural passenger rolling stock =XPT XPT in CountryLink livery The XPT (express passenger train) is the mainstay of the NSW country passenger rail-network. Modelled on the British HST and introduced from 1982, they currently provide service from Sydney to Melbourne, Brisbane, Dubbo, Grafton and Casino. An XPT consist can vary between four and seven cars depending on demand. Initially, the XPT was painted in a livery that was predominately red, with black and orange was also used in the livery and InterCity XPT signwriting on the power cars. The initial impact of the XPT's striking livery provided the inspiration for the \\"candy-stripe\\" livery to be applied to SRA locomotives and the interurban & country passenger car fleet from 1982. The first CountryLink repaint was introduced in 1991, and was updated to a new CountryLink livery in 2008. Class leader XP2000 has appeared in a number of special liveries for Sydney 2000 Games and the 2001 Centenary of Federation. In the early 1990s, XAM sleeping cars were added to the interstate XPT consists after protests arising from the cancellation of the locomotive hauled sitting & sleeping car trains Brisbane Limited and Pacific Coast Motorail in 1990. Xplorer Xplorer in the final CountryLink livery. The Xplorer is a diesel self-propelled multiple unit train, introduced from 1993. They provide services to Canberra, Griffith, Moree, Armidale and Broken Hill. They are technically and mechanically similar to NSW TrainLink's Endeavour railcars, but with a buffet service and a higher standard of accommodation.  Future Stock  New Regional Trains  The NSW TrainLink Regional Train Project is an initiative of Transport for NSW to procure new trains to replace NSW TrainLink's Endeavour, Xplorer and XPT fleets.  Intercity/Regional Passenger Locomotives = Former Stock  6 Class  The 6 class consisted of engines 6 and 7, built in 1856. They were of a 2-2-2 wheel configuration  9 Class  The 9 class was built in 1858 as a part passenger, part coal engine with a 2-2-2 wheel configuration.  G23 class  The G23 class was built in 1863, as a 2-4-0 engine. It used to be called the 23 class until 1890.  8N Class  The 8N class was built for the northern sector in 1864 as a 2-2-2 engine.

Structure Within the vertebrate eye, there are considered to be three chambers: anterior, posterior, and vitreous. It is important to note that the eye can also be classified as having two cavities: anterior and posterior. Both the anterior and posterior chambers are located within the anterior cavity, while the vitreous chamber is located in the posterior cavity. The best way to distinguish between the two cavities is to use the lens as a dividing point. The vitreous chamber is the largest of the three chambers and is located behind the lens and in front of the optic nerve. This chamber is filled with a thick, clear gel-like substance called the vitreous humor (also vitreous body). The humor plays a crucial role in supporting the posterior side of the lens. Function The vitreous fluid, along with supporting the lens, also functions in maintaining the shape of the entire vitreous chamber and posterior cavity. It is imperative that the eye remains the proper shape to ensure that the light passing through the lens and the fluid can focus properly on the retina. The composition of the fluid is 99% water and contains no cells, so the light can effectively pass through without it being deflected. The fluid is often thought to be a sort of liquid lens that further focuses the light that has already passed through the lens on the way to towards the retina.

Similar sequences, called DNA uptake sequences (DUS), are found in species of the family Neisseriaceae (including Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae). Neisseria meningitidis Genetic transformation is the process by which a recipient bacterial cell takes up DNA from a neighboring cell and integrates this DNA into the recipient's genome by recombination. In N. meningitidis, DNA transformation requires the presence of short DUS (10-12 mers residing in coding and intergenic regions) of the donor DNA. Specific recognition of DUSs is mediated by a type IV pilin. Davidsen et al. reported that in N. meningitidis DUSs occur at a significantly higher density in genes involved in DNA repair and recombination (as well as in restriction-modification and replication) than in other annotated gene groups. These authors proposed that the over-representation of DUS in DNA repair and recombination genes may reflect the benefit of maintaining the integrity of the DNA repair and recombination machinery by preferentially taking up genome maintenance genes that could replace their damaged counterparts in the recipient cell‚Äôs genome. Uptake of such genes could provide a mechanism for facilitating recovery from DNA damage after genotoxic stress.

The book was adapted into a 1990 telefilm, Lantern Hill, by Sullivan Films, the producer of the highly popular Anne of Green Gables television miniseries and the television series Road to Avonlea. The book's United States copyright was renewed in 1965.  Introduction  Montgomery began formulating an idea on May 11, 1936, began writing on August 21, and wrote the last chapter on February 3, 1937. She finished typing up the manuscript on February 25, as she could not hire a typist to do it for her.Mary Rubio, Elizabeth Waterston, Selected Journals of L.M. Montgomery Volume V: 1935-1942, Oxford University Press, 2005, This novel was dedicated to \\"JL\\", her companion cat. The novel was written at Montgomery's house, \\"Journey's End\\"; the environment influenced Montgomery's writing to create a positive setting for Jane in Toronto. The unusual episode in chapter 37 involving a lion was based on a similar incident Montgomery had been aware of that had occurred in Atlantic Canada several years before, which she detailed in a letter to GB MacMillan on February 23, 1938.My dear Mr. M: Letters to GB MacMillan from LM Montgomery, Mcgraw-Hill Ryerson Ltd, 1980 On April 17, 1939, she began working on a new Jane book, but the sequel was never completed. Plot summary Jane Victoria Stuart, called Victoria by her family, lives in Toronto, Ontario, with her mother, grandmother, and aunt. Her grandmother is very strict and is jealous of anything that her daughter Robin (Jane's mother) loves. Jane does not like having to live with her grandmother and wishes she and her mother could escape, though she knows her mother will never have enough backbone to stand up to her grandmother and leave. Jane believes her father to be dead, but is eventually told he is alive and living far away on Prince Edward Island, her birthplace. Jane's only friend is Josephine Turner, Jody for short, an orphan who lives and works as a servant at the boardinghouse next door. Jane also likes to cook, but her grandmother will not allow her to practice. One day, a letter from her estranged father arrives, asking that Jane stay with him for the summer on the Island. Jane is very reluctant about going, but one of her uncles says that it would be best if she went. Upon arriving at the island, Jane meets her Aunt Irene (her father's sister) and takes an instant dislike to her. The next morning, she meets her father for the first time and loves him from the start. The two buy a little house on Lantern Hill and Jane takes on the role of housekeeper. Jane soon becomes friends with all the neighbors, such as the Snowbeam family and the Jimmy Johns (so named to distinguish them from a James Garland and a John Garland who also live on the Island). Jane also gains self-possession and, upon her return to Toronto, is much less affected by her sour, disapproving grandmother. Jane eagerly counts down the months until she can return to the Island the following summer and be reunited with her father and friends. Upon returning, she has many adventures, including finding a lion that had escaped from a circus and fearlessly locking it up in a barn. When Jody writes to say that she is about to be sent to an orphanage, Jane talks to the Titus ladies, a pair of sisters who want to adopt a child. Initially they say no, but after some consideration, they decide to adopt Jody. Upon her return to Toronto, Jane tells her the good news and Jody soon leaves for the Island, promising to see Jane in the summer. In the meantime, Jane finds out why her parents have separated. She discovers that her grandmother was against her parents' relationship from the start; when her mother returned home for a visit during a rough time in her parents' marriage, her grandmother convinced her to stay, then burned the letter Jane's father sent asking her to return home. One day, Jane receives a letter from Aunt Irene saying that Jane's father is going to Boston, probably to get a divorce from her mother, and it is likely he will remarry. Jane is shocked by the news and sets out alone to see her father on the Island, over a thousand miles away. She uses her pocket-money to buy a train ticket, endures a sleepless journey of two days, then walks three miles from the station in the cold and wet to the house on Lantern Hill. Her father, astonished, assures her that he is not going to get a divorce or remarry; he is going to Boston to meet with publishers about a book of his that has been accepted. Jane then catches pneumonia and her father sends a telegram to her mother. Robin, ignoring her mother's command of staying in Toronto, goes to the island to be with Jane. Jane's father falls in love with her mother all over again on first sight, and when Jane awakens, her parents have reconciled. As the book ends, Jane is happily making plans for her reunited family who will spend half the year in Toronto and half on Lantern Hill. Reception The Independent wrote \\"Some may find this heroine ... a little too keen on being good, too.\\" and \\"Her relationship with her father, a writer whose waywardness is the opposite of the old world of her grandmother, is genuinely delightful to watch unfold.\\"  Adaptations = Television movies  1990: Lantern Hill - Directed by Kevin Sullivan.

The film was directed by Roy Ward Baker, produced by Milton Subotsky, and scripted by Robert Bloch (who adapted four of his own short stories for the screenplay). Baker had considerable experience as a director of horror films as he had tackled Quatermass and The Pit, and Scars of Dracula. Robert Bloch, who wrote the script for Asylum based on a series of his own short stories, was also the author of the novel Psycho, which Alfred Hitchcock directed as a film. It is a horror anthology film, one of several produced by Amicus during the 1960s and 1970s. Others were Dr. Terror's House of Horrors, Torture Garden, Tales from the Crypt, The House That Dripped Blood, The Vault of Horror, and From Beyond the Grave. Shot in April 1972, the film was edited and set for release 15 weeks after the final day of shooting, premi√®ring in July 1972 in the UK. The film had its North American d√©but on 17 November 1972. Plot (including cast list)=Framing Story Dr Martin arrives at a secluded asylum \\"for the incurably insane\\" to be interviewed for a job by the wheelchair-bound, authoritarian Lionel Rutherford. Rutherford explains that he owes his current incapacitation to an attack by an inmate. Rutherford reveals his unorthodox plan to determine Martin's suitability for the post of chief doctor. One of the asylum's current inmates is Dr B. Starr, the former head of the asylum, who underwent a complete mental breakdown. Martin is to interview the inmates of the asylum to deduce which one is Dr Starr. If his choice is correct, Rutherford will \\"consider\\" him for the post. The attendant Max Reynolds admits Martin through the security door to the inmates' solitary confinement cells, where he interviews each in turn. This story is loosely based on Bloch's short story \\"A Home Away from Home,\\" first published in Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine and adapted for television on The Alfred Hitchcock Hour. * Robert Powell ‚Äì Dr Martin * Patrick Magee ‚Äì Dr Lionel Rutherford * Geoffrey Bayldon ‚Äì Max Reynolds \\"Frozen Fear\\" Bonnie recounts the plot to murder Ruth, the wealthy wife of her lover Walter.

After learning what the suit will be used for (it will reanimate Mr Smith's deceased son) and that Mr Smith has no money to pay the tailor, Bruno fights Smith and accidentally kills him. He returns with the unsold suit. His wife Anna uses the suit to adorn their store mannequin, and its true powers are revealed when the mannequin comes to life.

Martin concludes his interview, and Max shows him downstairs to deliver his judgment to Rutherford.

Dr Starr's true identity is revealed: it is \\"Max Reynolds\\", who had murdered the real Reynolds two days before. He then strangles Martin to death. Sometime later, a new candidate for the job arrives and is met by Dr Starr, who escorts him into the asylum.  Critical reception  Allmovie's review of the film was favourable: \\"Asylum is a textbook example of the skill that Amicus Productions showed for producing entertaining horror anthology films.\\" Box office The film was one of Amicus' more popular movies at the UK box office. Despite this it was the last movie Robert Bloch wrote for the studio.Ed. Allan Bryce, Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood, Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 94-101 Soundtrack Though Douglas Gamley is credited as having composed the music for this film, the majority of the score is drawn from public domain pieces by Modest Mussorgsky, in particular Night on Bald Mountain (heard over the opening and closing credits). Selections from his Pictures at an Exhibition are also used: \\"Gnomus\\" is heard over both an early display of artworks depicting lunatics and past medical practices to deal with the insane, and during the sequence of Byron's mannequin coming to life and making its way downstairs. The booming crescendo of \\"The Hut on Hen's Legs\\" is heard over the sequence where the tailor's dummy is animated and rampages in Bruno's shop. DVD and Blu-ray release After years of releases using degraded 16mm (for TV) and old theatrical 35mm prints, the film finally received a deluxe DVD release in 2006 from Dark Sky Films. The DVD provides extensive special features including an audio commentary by director Roy Ward Baker and cameraman Neil Binney, plus \\"Inside the Fear Factory\\" (a featurette about Hammer rival Amicus Films), cast and crew bios, liner notes, trailers and a still photo gallery. The film was remastered from a pristine 35mm print.

He is the \\"Thompson\\" of the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system, which indexes certain folktales by their structure and assigns them AT numbers. He also developed an alpha-decimal motif-index system (A~Z followed by numeral) for cataloging individual motifs. Biography=Early life Stith Thompson was born in Bloomfield, Nelson County, Kentucky, on March 7, 1885 the son of John Warden and Eliza (McClaskey). Thompson moved with his family to Indianapolis at the age of twelve and attended Butler University from 1903 to 1905 before he obtained his BA degree from University of Wisconsin in 1909. For the next two years he taught at Lincoln High School in Portland, Oregon, during which time he learned Norwegian from lumberjacks. He earned his master's degree in English literature from the University of California, Berkeley in 1912. Graduate education He studied at Harvard University from 1912 to 1914 under George Lyman Kittredge, writing the dissertation \\"European Borrowings and Parallels in North American Indian Tales,\\" and earning his Ph.D. (The revised thesis was later published in 1919).(pp. 226-249) This grew out of Kittredge's assignment, whose theme was investigating a certain tale called \\"The Blue Band\\",The tale that Pliny Earle Goddard collected and published in Chipewyan Texts (1912) is \\"The Boy who became Strong\\". The tale Kittredge refers to is the parallel, M√ºllenhoff (1845)'s tale \\"XI. Der blaue Band\\" from Marne in Dithmarschen, Schleswig- Holstein, Germany, translated by Benjamin Thorpe (1853) as \\"The Blue Riband\\". collected from the Chipewyan tribe in Saskatchewan may derive from contact with an analogous Scandinavian tale.= (Repr. 1977, 2006) Post-graduate, tenure Thompson was an English instructor at the University of Texas, Austin from 1914 to 1918, teaching composition. In 1921, he was appointed associate professor at the English Department of the Indiana University (Bloomington), which also had the responsibility of overseeing its composition program. He collected and archived traditional ballads, tales, proverbs, aphorisms, riddles, etc. The parallels and worldwide distributions of these could be studied using his motif cataloguing apparatus leading him to publish the first volume of his Motif-Index which was printed in 1955. He organized an informal quadrennial summertime \\"Institute of Folklore\\" beginning in 1942 which lasted beyond his retirement from tenure in 1955. In 1962, a permanent Institute of Folklore was established at Bloomington, with Richard Dorson serving as its administrator and chief editor of its journal publication. For nearly twenty years after his retirement, Thompson continued to work on his Motif-Index of Folk-Literature and The Types of the Folktale while also taking time to collaborate on projects with other folklorists such as Jonah Balys' The Oral Tales of India and Warren Roberts' Types of Indic Folktales. He even produced an anthology at the age of 83, One Hundred Favorite Folktales. In 1976, Thompson died of heart failure at his home in Columbus, Indiana. While Thompson wrote, co-wrote, or translated numerous books and articles on folklore, he became arguably best known for his work on the classification of motifs in folk tales. His six-volume Motif-Index of Folk-Literature (1955‚Äì1958) is considered the international key to traditional material.

Aggregate Industries manufactures and supplies a range of heavy building materials, primarily aggregates such as stone, asphalt and concrete, to the construction industry and other business sectors. Aggregate Industries also manufactures and imports cement, and provides a range of aggregate-associated goods and services, these include the manufacture of masonry and reconstructed stone items for construction industry and domestic applications, the manufacture of pre-cast concrete items, the supply of ready mixed concrete, design and project management consulting, and resurfacing contracting services. Aggregate Industries operates more than 60 quarries in the UK and has several bases throughout mainland Europe and Scandinavia. Its clients operate in a range of services including construction, aviation, education, horticulture, road building, housing, power and energy and rail. History The story of Aggregate Industries began with the Ellis family of Beaumont Leys, which is now part of Leicester. Active Quakers, the family was influential in the Midlands' first public railway, the Leicester and Swannington Railway, which was used to transport granite from local quarries. In time, John Ellis became the local MP and his descendant, Joseph Ellis II, entered into partnership with a Breedon Everard of Groby, initially as coal merchants, later extending their business interests to granite. In 1858, following the death of Joseph Ellis II, his sons James and Joseph joined with Breedon Everard to lease the Bardon quarries belonging to Robert Jacomb-Hood II of Bardon Hall. Those quarries, now known as Bardon Hills, are still active under the management of Aggregate Industries, and the nearby Bardon Hall is the company's headquarters. Aggregate Industries has subsequently grown, mainly through a series of acquisitions and particularly since 1990. In 2005 the company was acquired by the Swiss-based Holcim Group, which in 2014 was one of the largest cement companies in the world. In July 2015, Aggregate Industries became a member of LafargeHolcim following a global merger between Lafarge and Holcim, creating the biggest construction materials supplier in the world. Governance Aggregate Industries' board is chaired by a representative from LafargeHolcim. Other members comprise the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer/Deputy Chief Executive and a Non Executive Director. The board oversees performance and ensures that Aggregate Industries complies with the principles of good corporate governance. Strategy formulation, operational management, performance monitoring and the evaluation of major capital projects fall within the remit of the UK Executive Committee. This comprises the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer/Deputy Chief Executive, Organisation & Human Resources Director, and the Directors for the Cement & Concrete Products, Aggregates, Asphalt and Readymix, Contracting and Commercial Divisions. Controversy Massachusetts State Police searched the offices of Aggregate Industries, the largest concrete supplier for the underground portions of the Big Dig, in June 2005. They seized evidence that Aggregate delivered concrete that did not meet contract specifications. In March 2006 Massachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly announced plans to sue project contractors and others because of poor work on the project. Over 200 complaints were filed by the state of Massachusetts as a result of leaks, cost overruns, quality concerns, and safety violations. In total, the state has sought approximately $100 million from the contractors ($1 for every $141 spent). In May 2006, six employees of the company were arrested and charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. In July 2007, Aggregate Industries settled the case with an agreement to pay $50 million. $42 million of the settlement went to civil cases and $8 million was paid in criminal fines. The company will provide $75 million in insurance for maintenance as well as pay $500,000 toward routine checks on areas suspected to contain substandard concrete. Products Goods and services provided by Aggregate Industries include: * Road surfacing products and contracting service - Aggregate Industries lays, maintains and resurfaces roads, including just under half of the UK's strategic road network. * Garden and driveway landscaping - the company's Bradstone range is one of the UK's leading names in garden and driveway landscaping and products. * Masonry - in particular, cast stone walling blocks for interior and exterior use. * Ready mix concrete and screed - Aggregate Industries is one of the UK's leading suppliers of ready mix concrete, and supplies a wide range of products, chiefly for the construction industry. * Roofing tiles - including reconstructed stone roof tiles, which are largely used as an affordable and viable replacement for slate tiles, since these are becoming somewhat difficult to source. * Staircases and flooring - these products, which include beam and block flooring, hollowcore flooring, staircases and landings, are primarily supplied through Aggregate Industries' sister company, Charcon Construction Solutions. * Surface water solutions - products to facilitate drainage of surface water. * Sustainable drainage systems (SUDS) - products to reduce flood risk, using a range of surfacing materials. * Walling - products in both reconstructed and natural stone, also structural and architectural solutions. * Aggregates - these include crushed rock, sand and gravel, stone and fill materials. These are mainly used in construction projects. * Asphalt - Aggregate Industries supplies asphalt (and associated contracting services) for a range of applications including major road projects, airfields, pedestrian footpaths, driveways and sports surfaces. The company produces more than 6 million tonnes of asphalt each year. * Cement/cementitious materials - Aggregate Industries imports and supplies both grey and white cement, which is used in various forms including ready-mixed and precast concrete, mortars, screed and render. The company also offers a range of sustainable cement replacements including ground granulated blast slag, and fly ash. * Commercial hard landscaping - including paving, kerbs and drainage products and technical/design support. * Concrete blocks - in a wide range of sizes and strengths, including both dense and lightweight, and for a range of applications. Recognisable products and services Not all of Aggregate Industries' products and services are marketed under the Aggregate Industries name. Other Aggregate Industries products include: * Bradstone * Charcon * Express Asphalt * Garside Sands * Masterblock * London Concrete * Spadeoak * Witherley * Aggregate Industries Overseas * Ronez * Bennett's Barges Source: Sustainability While recognising that it operates within an industry marked by high energy consumption and transport needs, Aggregate Industries has a strong commitment to sustainability and to managing the impacts of its work upon people and the environment. It was the first company in the world to be certified to BES 6001, a framework for responsible sourcing of construction materials, by the Building Research Establishment, and the first in the construction sector to develop a company-wide Biodiversity Action Plan, in 2002. The organisation also has stated commitments and goals relating to carbon and energy, transport, waste and water. For example, between 2009 and 2012, the amount of waste it sent to landfill dropped from 52,251 tonnes to 13,555 tonnes. Aggregate Industries also produces a range of products that are designed with sustainability in mind, such as its low carbon, low water 'Life' range. Logistics Aggregate Industries delivers a wide range of heavy building materials to clients in many different locations, thus its logistics needs challenge its commitment to sustainability. However, the organisation aims to make its transport services both efficient and environmentally friendly. As well as using lorries to transport goods, powered by biofuels where possible, Aggregate Industries owns several ships and barges, and is an open access Train Operator. Many of its quarries have railheads on site, allowing materials to be loaded onto the transport vehicle immediately, minimising environmental impact. The company's largest ship, the Yeoman Bridge, can carry around 100,000 tonnes. The barges, which are based on the River Thames at Gravesend, provide an effective and environmentally friendly way of transporting heavy goods into the heart of London, each carrying around 1,000 tonnes. Employee relations Aggregate Industries employs 4,000 employees. It has, for many years, administered apprenticeships, young enterprise programmes and work experience, and maintains a graduate training programme. In 2012 it became the first company in its sector to establish a training scheme approved by the Institution of Civil Engineers that allowed participants to work towards achieving professional status. However, with a predominantly male workforce, many of whom are over 40, Aggregate Industries has also taken steps to safeguard the talent that it already has by encouraging staff to look after their health. During 2014, the company launched its 'Healthy You' programme, designed to raise awareness among staff of the need to address not work-based health and safety issues, but also underlying health concerns such as cardiovascular health, diabetes and mental health. The roll-out of Healthy You was accompanied by the introduction of compulsory occupational health medicals. Also in 2014, the company announced that it would invest over ¬£200,000 in placing defibrillators across 220 sites. Recent and ongoing capital investment In November 2014, Aggregate Industries announced the completion of a ¬£30 million upgrade of its quarry at Glensanda, in the Scottish Highlands, which is Europe's largest granite quarry. The upgrade included the construction of a new primary crushing machine and new tunnel for transporting the aggregates from the site directly onto waiting ships, and secured 500 Scottish jobs for the next quarter century, that being the predicted lifespan of the crushing machine. Aggregate Industries' CEO, Pat Ward, has described the ¬£30 million investment as being part of an ongoing programme of upgrades which includes new asphalt plants in Sheffield and Heathrow, as well as new crusher machinery at Moorcroft quarry in Plymouth. Research and innovation Linked to its commitment to sustainability, is Aggregate Industries' involvement in a range of innovative projects. These include Pipe Dream, an innovative high density, tunnel-style housing scheme, which has been developed by ZEDFactory Limited (developers of the first potentially zero carbon village in the UK) using precast concrete elements by Charcon Construction Solutions, which is an Aggregate Industries brand. Aggregate Industries has also been involved in the creation of England's first certified Passivhaus, Underhill Passivhaus, which is just outside Moreton-in-Marsh in Gloucestershire. Aggregate Industries is also exploring the potential of off-site manufactured housing, made with precast concrete, and insulating concrete formwork 'building shell' systems.

Together with the neighbouring villages of Laytown and Mornington it comprises the census town of Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington with a combined population of 10,889 at the 2011 Census and 11,872 (with Donacarney) at the 2016 Census. During the Celtic Tiger, with increasing property prices in Dublin, Bettystown expanded to cater for large numbers of commuters to Dublin. The area was well known before that as a spot for Dublin summer holiday visitors, with a number of caravan parks and seaside amusements. In 2007, it was announced that in revisions to D√°il Constituency boundaries for 2012, Bettystown and Laytown as far as the River Nanny would be ceded from the three-seat constituency of Meath East to the five-seat constituency of Louth. Transport The Dublin and Drogheda Railway line opened on 25 May 1844 with a station at Bettystown. However, this station was to close soon after in November 1847 and since then the village has been served by Laytown railway station also opened on the Dublin and Drogheda Railway line on 25 May 1844 (renamed as Laytown & Bettystown in 1913). Bus √âireann route D1 provides service between Laytown and Drogheda via Bettystown. Education There are two primary schools in Laytown/Bettystown which follow a Catholic ethos. They are Scoil Oilibh√©ir Naofa (opened in 2005) and Scoil an Spioraid Naomh Senior School. There are also two multi-denominational schools outside the town that service East Meath and South Drogheda. They are Le Cheile Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil an Bhradain Feasa. Le Cheile Educate Together National School is sited on grounds provided by another South Drogheda school, Drogheda Grammar. A secondary school, Col√°iste na hInse, was built in Laytown in 2008. Recreation  Leisure facilities in the Bettystown area include Funtasia, an amusement park, a tennis club and a golf course. Funtasia is an indoor family fun center, with bowling, pool and 'fairground' rides. Laytown & Bettystown Golf Club celebrated 100 years in 2009. Several club members have been capped for Ireland. Ireland held the European Land Sailing championships in September 2017 on Bettystown beach. Over 100 European sailors competed over this 5 day period of competitions. Bettystown beach has been host to the annual National Sandcastle and Sand Sculpturing competition in Ireland since 2003. Archaeology In 1850 the Tara Brooch was found on the beach at Bettystown.

Formerly known as the Township of Shedden, the municipality adopted its current status and name in 2004, taking the name of its largest community. The Town of Spanish is situated at the mouth of the Spanish River where it empties into the North Channel of Lake Huron. This river and its ecologically rich delta have had a positive impact on the development of the community of Spanish. The river has played an important and continuous role in the local economy from the days of the fur trade, through the timbering era, and now contributes to the tourism industry. History According to legend, the Spanish name was derived around the year 1750. Numerous persons have attempted to explain the rationale for the name \\"Spanish\\" in what was once historically part of New France. There are several different theories regarding the name of the community. According to local legends a French Jesuit Father was travelling in the area in the 1700s and encountered a Spanish speaking woman with children. The woman had been captured by local warriors in a battle in Spanish controlled lands far to the south in what is now the United States of America, and had been married to a local Ojibway chief, the family taking the name \\"Espaniel\\". Espaniel is a common surname among the local Ojibway communities. Another variant of the story has it that it was in fact a Spaniard who had fled the Spain-controlled lower Mississippi Valley during the fur trade days and had taken refuge along the North Shore and married into a local Ojibway community. Other theories on the name of Spanish include a claim that Dr. J.J. Bigsby, a geologist with the Canadian Boundary Commission, named the river to contrast with the nearby French River. Further intrigue arises from the 1980 discovery of two Spanish coins from 1742 found near the mouth of the Sauble River. This has led to speculation of very early Spanish-speaking explorers along the North Shore. The Spanish River has had numerous names since names were recorded. John McBean, HBC Factor at the La Cloche Trading Post recorded the name Eskimanetigon in his map of 1824. Elder Peter Owl of Sagamok states the name has traditionally been Minitegozibe. The Ministry has named a Provincial Park on the upper river The Spanish River Valley Minitegoibe Signature site. Early settlement of the area gained momentum in the latter part of the 1800s with the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in February 1884, between Lake Nipissing and Algoma, now known as Algoma Mills. According to an article in the Ontario Gazetteer, by 1903‚Äì1904, the Spanish River Station (the railway designation for Spanish) had a population of approximately 200 with two timber companies operating in the vicinity: Huron Lumber Co. and Spanish River Co. W. H. Graham operated a general store, William Coget ran the hotel and the local blacksmith as well as the Postmaster was Gustavo Hamilton. During the same year (1903‚Äì1904), the community of Spanish Mills, located on Aird Island in the North Channel just south of the Town of Spanish, also had a thriving timber industry complete with a sawmill, schoolhouse, and general store. The Sable and Spanish River Boom and Dam Co. and the Spanish River Lumber Company.  Residential Schools  The earliest version of the Spanish Indian Residential Schools was originally a log cabin in Wiikwemkoong, Manitoulin Island from 1850‚Äì1911. It was a day school for Native boys. Father Proulx was the first priest. In 1860 the Jesuit Priests managed the school. The old school burned down and a new site was chosen, were purchased at the mouth of the Spanish River. Reverend Joseph Sauve and Father Paquin undertook to build, design and supervise construction. In the fall of 1913 the school commenced. Boys from as far as Manitoba and as close as Cutler (Serpent River First Nations) attended the school. A shoe-maker shop and a pump house were built. Self-sufficient dormitories, classrooms, several lavatories, kitchen, a scullery, pantry, refrigerated area, corridors, offices, cloistered area, laundry room, infirmary, bakery and tailor shop were housed in the school. In 1981 a chapel was added. Near the school stood a wind mill powerhouse and shoe shop, a mill and a storage for milled products, a huge barn which held cows, several horse teams, a bull, a dairy operation and a blacksmith shop, a piggery and sheepery, a chicken coop and a garden. At the wharf was a cruiser named the Garnier and a vessel called Red Bug were tied up. Likewise in Wiikwemkoong a Native School for girls was located. It was run by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary from 1862‚Äì1914. The log cabin burned down in 1916 and was relocated opposite the boys school in Spanish. Both schools were funded by the Federal Government. The Indian Act stated that \\"Indians can attend a residential school if an Indian Day School is not available to them within a three mile (5 km) radius.\\" Children from broken homes and where home conditions were not the best were also sent to be enrolled into the schools. Remains of the residential school in 2008. The Daughters of the Heart of Saint Mary was an organization formed by and idea from a young French woman who hoped for a life of religion to a woman whose responsibilities kept them in the world. This idea occurred to a Jesuit priest when the woman approached him during the French Revolution. The Society was founded in 1790 and was forced to go underground. The society came to Canada 100 years ago to work among the natives in Ontario. In 1981 the building which was the former \\"Girls School\\" burned down and the \\"Boys School\\" was demolished in 2004. The shell of the \\"Girls School\\" still remains as a witness to history.

The law formerly permitted an abortion to be performed under some limited circumstances, but, in 1998, all exceptions were removed when a new abortion law went into effect.United Nations Population Division. (2002). Abortion Policies: A Global Review. Retrieved July 14, 2006. History of Salvadoran abortion law El Salvador's 1956 Penal Code contained no explicit exception to its prohibition of abortion, although, under accepted principles of criminal law, one could be justified if necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman. In response to the fact that the practice of illegal abortion was common, and was a major contributor to the rate of maternal mortality, the Salvadoran government chose to expand the cases in which abortion was permitted. Under the new Penal Code of 1973, an abortion could be legally allowed under three major conditions: if the pregnant woman's life was endangered and abortion was the only means to preserve it, if her pregnancy had resulted from rape or statutory rape, or if a serious congenital disorder was detected in the fetus. An abortion caused on part of the woman's negligence was exempted from prosecution, and the government also provided reduced penalties for a woman of good standing if she had consented to an illegal abortion, or self-induced one, in the interest of protecting her reputation. Reform process and current law Proposals to eliminate the exceptions to the general prohibition against abortion started to come before the country's Legislative Assembly in 1992. One bill would have resulted in the investigation of medical clinics suspected of providing abortion; as a result of a 1993 study, overseen by a politician affiliated with the Christian Democratic Party, several health care workers were arrested. Another proposal in 1993, which was supported by the Archbishop of San Salvador and the \\"Say Yes to Life Foundation\\" (an anti-abortion group), would have made December 28, a traditional Roman Catholic feast day known as the Day of the Innocents, the \\"Day of the Unborn\\".Center for Reproductive Rights. (2001). Political Process and Abortion Legislation in El Salvador. Retrieved March 3, 2007. In 1997, the Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) submitted a draft bill, designed to amend the Penal Code to withdraw all grounds under which abortion was then permitted. On April 25, 1997, the Legislative Assembly voted 61 out of 84 to approve this modification to the Code. On April 20, 1998, the new Penal Code was enacted, removing the exceptions that had been instituted in 1973, including the provision for the pregnant woman's life. Under this Code, a person who performs an abortion with the woman's consent, or a woman who self-induces or consents to someone else inducing her abortion, can be imprisoned for two to eight years. A person who performs an abortion to which the woman has not consented can be sentenced to four to ten years in jail; if the person is a physician, pharmacist, or other health care worker, he or she is instead subject to between six and 12 years. El Salvador also amended its Constitution in January 1999 to recognize human life from the moment of conception. Objections to the law The organizations IPAS, MADRE, and Women's Link Worldwide submitted a report to the United Nations Human Rights Committee in which they contended that the El Salvadoran law against abortion violates several treaties that El Salvador has ratified: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR); the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD); the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC); and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). They point out that \\"The Constitution of El Salvador protects every person‚Äôs right to life, liberty, security of person, and social justice. Furthermore it establishes that all persons are equal before the law and there can be no restrictions based on race, gender or religion. El Salvador‚Äôs criminal anti-abortion legislation violates all of these constitutional and human rights established in the previously mentions international conventions.\\" Continued practice of abortion in El Salvador Unsafe abortion is a serious public health problem and the second direct cause of maternal mortality in El Salvador. In 1994, the third-most-prevalent cause of mortality among adolescent girls was pregnancy and postpartum complications. Some of the girls arrested for trying to have abortions are as young as ten. It's a drain on resources in a country where health care expenditures in 1997 were $24 per person per year. The criminalization of abortion has extremely serious consequences for women‚Äôs lives and health: abortions performed under dangerous conditions; high mortality and morbidity rates; and a lack of reliable studies that could help health services provide better care to their clients, including women who have had abortions in unsafe conditions. This situation is further exacerbated by the persecution of women by the Salvadoran justice and health systems. In some cases, therapeutic abortions are performed by physicians in medical settings, and justified as other procedures, e.g. a laparotomy (abdominal incision) rather than an abortion. Miscarriages Many low-income women who have a miscarriage or a stillbirth are often prosecuted. Oftentimes they are reported by medical personnel to the police and subsequently arrested in the hospital. They are wrongly accused of abortion or homicide and sentenced up to 40 years in prison. Currently, there are 17 women in prison for pregnancy related complications that have not had due process while being prosecuted., Abortion methods in El Salvador Doctors in El Salvador report that women seeking abortions use a wide variety of methods: clothes hangers, metal rods, high doses of contraceptives, fertilizers, gastritis remedies, soapy water, and caustic fluids (such as battery acid). The most common methods are pills, such as Cytotec and potassium permanganate (inserted vaginally); catheters to inject soapy water or caustic liquids; rods of any type of material to penetrate the uterus; injections of unknown solutions; or a combination of abortion methods, such as pills, a catheter, and an injection or pills and a metal rod. Using pills, catheters, injections and rods can kill a woman or injure her permanently. In addition to having only dangerous methods at their disposal, the women being tried for abortion were forced to self-induce abortions in their homes, in unsanitary conditions or in clandestine clinics that could not guarantee adequate procedures. If complications arise due to the conditions in which the abortion was practiced, they are then at risk of being reported by hospital staff who treat the complications. All of this highlights the risk to life, health, security of person and liberty that terminating an unwanted pregnancy represents for young, low-income women in El Salvador. Prosecutions A report in 2001 revealed that, after the new Penal Code went into effect in 1998, 69 cases of illegal abortions had been prosecuted. In 23 of those cases, the women involved had been turned over to the authorities by health care workers when they arrived at the hospital seeking treatment after an unsafe abortion. Most abortions had been self-induced, through the use of clothes hangers, or by the ingestion of harmful amounts of hormonal contraception pills, antacids, or misoprostol pills.Center for Reproductive Rights.

In fact, Karina del Carmen Herrera Climaco had given birth at home and then began to bleed heavily. (The pregnancy was almost certainly unintentional, as it occurred after a tubal ligation.) Her mother called police to take her to hospital. While she was in hospital, police searched her home and found a lifeless infant. Medical examination failed to determine if the infant was born alive or dead, nor a cause of death. Nevertheless, a sentence of aggravated homicide was passed, separating her from her three children. Almost 8 years later, thanks to the efforts of a group of activists and national and international attorneys, Karina‚Äôs sentence was reviewed. It was annulled and she was released. She has not been compensated for her eight years of incarceration. Another 30-year sentence was passed out for an apparent miscarriage, in August 2008, by the Tribunal of San Francisco Gotera in the department of Morazan. Mar√≠a Edis Hern√°ndez M√©ndez de Castro, 30, was a single mother with 4 children when she found out she was pregnant. Maria told her family that she was pregnant, even though she didn't know how far along the pregnancy was. During the pregnancy, Maria felt a pain and went to the bathroom in her home at which time she suffered labor complications and passed out. She regained consciousness in the National Hospital of San Francisco. The doctor that treated Maria reported her to the police on suspicion of having an abortion. She was convicted of aggravated homicide and sentenced to thirty years in prison. Two more cases of women sentenced to lengthy prison terms for what might have been abortions or miscarriages are detailed in the same report. Medical harm The lack of contraceptive information and the ban on abortion put women's lives at risk, particularly when they are young. One- third of the women giving birth are 19 or younger, and a handful are 10 ‚Äì 14 years old. Case of \\"Beatriz\\" In 2013, a case arose of a pregnant 22-year- old woman, identified as \\"Beatriz,\\" who, due to lupus aggravated by loss of kidney function, was told by doctors that she would likely die if she gave birth and that the child, due to its anencephaly, would likely have only a few hours of life. Her doctors requested permission from the government to perform an abortion because the fetus was nonviable and Beatriz was likely to die. When the case came before the Supreme Court, the court denied Beatriz's request. She was given permission to have an early caesarean section, the same procedure that would have been used had the court ruled in her favor. Legally, this was not an abortion because the fetus was incubated and given fluids. The child died five hours after the procedure. Beatriz was able to recover and leave the hospital. The case was identified by reproductive rights activists as evidence of a lack of progress towards the goals of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, which affirmed reproductive rights as human rights and emphasized the importance of reducing maternal mortality.

Turnsole was an essential ingredient in some of the pigments used in such illustrations Turnsole or folium was a dyestuff prepared from the annual plant Chrozophora tinctoria. History Turnsole became a mainstay of medieval manuscript illuminators starting with the development of the technique for extracting it in the thirteenth century, when it joined the vegetable-based woad and indigo in the illuminator's repertory. However, the queen of blue colorants was always the expensive lapis lazuli or its substitute azurite, ground to the finest powders. Turnsole was downgraded to a shading glaze and fell out of use in the illuminator's palette by the turn of the seventeenth century, with the easier availability of less fugitive mineral-derived blue pigments. According to its method of preparation, turnsole produced a range of translucent colors from blue, through purple to red, depending to its reaction to the acidity or alkalinity of its environment, in a chemical reaction, not understood in the Middle Ages, that is most familiar in the Litmus test. Chrozophora tinctoria fruit Folium (\\"leaf\\"), was actually derived from the three-lobed fruit (illustration), not the leaves, and medieval recipes are explicit that the fruits must not be broken, or the seeds released, during production of the pigment. The fruits were collected in autumn (August, September) In the early fifteenth century, Cennino Cennini, in his Libro dell' Arte gives a recipe \\"XVIII: How you should tint paper turnsole color\\" and \\"LXXVI To paint a purple or turnsole drapery in fresco.\\" (though neither of these recipes use or describe turnsole). Textiles soaked in the dye vat would be left in a close damp cellar in an atmosphere produced by pans of urine. It was not realized that the oxidizing urine was producing ammonia, but the technique reminds us how foul-smelling was the dyer's art. It was sold impregnated into small pieces of linen and then extracted for use. The colour has been attributed to several different chemicals, including an anthocyanin. Production of the pigment is described in a 15th century manuscript and this was used as the basis of producing the dye. Although the plant extracts do contain several anthocyanins, the colour is due to a hermidin derivative, 6‚Ä≤-hydroxy-4,4‚Ä≤-dimethoxy-1,1‚Ä≤-dimethyl-5‚Ä≤-{[3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl]oxy}-[3,3‚Ä≤-bipyridine]-2,2‚Ä≤,5,6(1H,1‚Ä≤H)-tetraone, which has been named chrozophoridin. The blue colour is caused by dimers of the two atropisomers of this compound. Turnsole was used as a food colorant, mentioned in Du Fait de Cuisine which suggests steeping it in milk. The French Cook by Fran√ßois Pierre La Varenne (London 1653) mentions turnsole grated in water with a little powder of Iris. It was also used to dye red the rind of a cheese from the Netherlands. Herbals indicated that the plant grows on sunny, well-drained Mediterranean slopes and called it solsequium (\\"sun-follower\\") from its habit of turning its flowers to face the sun; alternatively it might be called \\"Greater Verucaria\\";So named in a recipe for producing the colorant, Pro tornasolio faciendo, British Library, Sloane Mss 1754, folio 235 verso, quoted in Daniel V.

In: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online e. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, September 2004). Retrieved 8 September 2010. Life Dorothy was born on 17 February 1755, probably at Woodford, Essex as the youngest of five children of Thomas Kilner (1719‚Äì1804), public servant and landowner, and his wife, Frances, n√©e Ayscough (1718‚Äì1768). The family moved to Maryland Point, then in Essex, in 1759. Kilner was much inspired by a friendship that began in childhood with Mary Ann Maze (Mary Ann Kilner, 1753‚Äì1831). This involved exchanging copious verse letters on religious and personal matters. When Maze married Dorothy's brother Thomas Kilner (1750‚Äì1812) in 1774, Dorothy moved into their house in Spitalfields, London and helped to bring up their five children. Both Dorothy and Mary Ann became prolific writers of books for children. The family moved to Margate in 1787 and to Dorothy's father's house at Maryland Point in 1789. Predeceased by most of her family, Dorothy became an invalid after a back injury in 1817, and her mind became unhinged in her later years, but she was looked after by her niece Frances and her grand-niece Maria. She died on 5 February 1836 and was buried in West Ham.

P. and Mary Pelham, in line with general practice for female authors in that period. \\"M. P.\\" may have referred to her home town of Maryland Point. Both she and her sister-in-law were published by the London firm of John Marshall. Kilner's best-known book was The Life and Perambulation of a Mouse (1784). This has been praised by a present-day critic as a book that \\"draws least attention to gaps and contradictions.... The story is episodic, as we follow the mouse Nimble through various households and overhear a variety of conversations.... This episodic, even picaresque, form effectively naturalizes‚Äîdefuses‚Äîpotential inconsistency.\\"Beverley Lyon Clark, \\"Reconstructing Dorothy Kilner: Anecdotes as Antidotes in Project Muse\\". Project Muse Retrieved 25 October 2016. Other titles of hers included Anecdotes of a Boarding School, or an antidote to the vices of those Establishments (1790) and Little Stories for Little Folks (c. 1785). Kilner wrote clearly and well, but in an age when the moral side of children's literature still predominated. So The Village School (1795) is subtitled A Collection of Entertaining Histories for the Instruction and Amusement of All Good Children. These feature a Mrs. Bell (the schoolteacher) and a Mr. Right (the parson). The book concludes: \\"From this fatal accident it is to be hoped, that every body will learn to be extremely cautious not to leave candles burning near linen, nor, indeed, anywhere, without constantly watching, that they may not do mischief.\\" Nonetheless, her discernment of children's character and amusements shines through. Copies of the books of Dorothy and Mary Ann were found long after their deaths in a trunk in their Maryland Point home. Several titles continued to be reprinted for many years. The Life and Perambulation of a Mouse, for instance, reappeared in 1870 in a collection edited by Charlotte M. Yonge, entitled A Storehouse of Stories.

The main exit of the Gamla stan metro station is located on M√§lartorget. History Sculpture 'The Family' The square appears in historical records in 1866 and came into being in the mid-19th century as a by-product when a new harbour was created by land filling. It was originally used to unload agricultural products delivered to the city from around the Lake M√§laren region. The location was historically known as Flugm√∂tet (\\"Flies' Meeting\\") because all latrines produced in the city were emptied behind a wooden paling here before being rowed away by worn-out old women, often former inmates seeking solace in the bottle, during nights. The waste products were brought to a plant on Kungsholmen where it was transformed into a gunpowder component. Though the latrine heap was discontinued during the 1840s, and this latter name never was made explicitly official, it appears in a guidebook in 1844, and was proposed as an official name in 1921.

He was a native of Glasgow, born there on 8 April 1851. His parents were devout members of the United Original Secession Church at the time, although in 1865 they joined the Reformed Presbyterian Church. They dedicated their son John to the ministry, a dedication he solemnly accepted for himself. He was educated at the High School and the University of Glasgow, where he won many prizes, including two gold and two silver medals. He graduated M.A. in 1873. Struthers studied theology at the Divinity Hall of Glasgow University and the Free Church College, Glasgow. He won Dr. John Caird's Special Prize for Sermon Composition at the University Divinity School. He was licensed to preach by the Reformed Presbyterians on 8 May 1876 and on 1 November 1878 he was ordained minister over the Reformed Presbyterian congregation at Whithorn in Wigtownshire. There he redecorated the church and manse. After a three-year pastorate at Whithorn, Struthers was called to the pastorate of the Reformed Presbyterian Church at Greenock, where he was inducted on 25 January 1882. He spent the rest of his life as the minister there. Theologically Struthers was a Reformed Presbyterian indeed, a staunch Calvinist and a lover of the Westminster Shorter Catechism. His preaching was popular, and he emphasised the love of God for sinners in his sermons. This love of God, exemplified in Jesus Christ dying on the cross, was the centre of his ministry. Struthers was instrumental in building a new church for the Greenock congregation. Built to his specifications, it still stands today. In 1887 the Reformed Presbyterian Church decided to begin its own Sunday-School magazine. Struthers took the editorship and the little work, The Morning Watch began to be issued in 1888. It consisted of twelve pages, mostly written by Struthers and illustrated by a capable Greenock artist, Miss Annie Macdonald. The professional relationship of the bachelor minister and the unmarried artist grew into something deeper and they were married on 20 May 1907. Although offered a D.D. by Glasgow, Struthers declined it, saying that it would look ridiculous for a children's magazine to be edited by a D.D. He was always a humble man and was content to be \\"The Children's Editor\\". The theologian James Denney said the Morning Watch was one of the hundred best books in the world. Today it offers a charming window into childhood in late Victorian and Edwardian Scotland. J.P. Struthers died suddenly on Sunday 17 January 1915. He collapsed while preaching his evening sermon, dying a few hours later. His main published work is his beloved magazine, although his wife edited a volume of his sermons under the title Windows in Heaven (London, James Clark, 1926).

He is probably best known today for his defense of the doctrine of penal substitution. Early life Denney was born in Paisley, Scotland, 5 February 1856, to Cameronian (Reformed Presbyterian) parents. His father was a joiner and Cameronian deacon. In 1876 the family followed the majority of the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland into union with the Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at the Highlanders' Academy, Greenock, University of Glasgow, from 1874 to 1879 and then at Free Church College, Glasgow until 1883. He won the Moral Philosophy gold medal and Blackstone Prize while at Glasgow University. He was influenced greatly by Edward Caird and Richard Jebb and briefly became a student assistant to John Veitch. Denney was an outstanding student at Free Church College, where he studied under Dr. George C.M. Douglas (Old Testament), Dr. T.M. Lindsay (Church History), Dr. James Candlish (Systematic Theology) and Dr Alexander Balmain Bruce (New Testament). Denney was greatly influenced by Professor Bruce in particular, adopting his system of apologetics. Denney said that Professor Bruce \\"let me see Jesus\\" rather than cluttering his lectures with abstruse points. While still a student Denney published his first work, Natural Law in the Spiritual World, by a Brother of the Natural Man. It was a trenchantly critical review of Henry Drummond's Natural Law in the Spiritual World. Ministry After university he turned to the Ministry. Denney was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Greenock on 16 May 1883 and was appointed Missioner to the Hill Street Mission of St. John's (Free Church), Glasgow. In 1886, he was called to be pastor of the East Free Church, Broughty Ferry, where he succeeded his friend and mentor Professor Bruce. At Broughty Ferry Denney was a popular preacher who preached the Gospel to the common people. He married May Carmichael Brown on 1 July 1886. Their marriage was a happy one. According to William Robertson Nicoll, Denney, previously tempted away from the Evangelical and Reformed faith of his parents, was influenced to return in that direction by his wife's encouraging him to read sermons by C.H. Spurgeon. Some of his expository sermons preached at Broughty Ferry were published in two volumes of The Expositor's Bible, edited by W. Robertson Nicoll, The Epistles to the Thessalonians in 1892 and The Second Epistle to the Corinthians in 1894. (Amusingly, some copies of the commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians in a later edition of The Expositor's Bible have Denney's name on the covers. The book was in fact written, as the title page makes clear, by Marcus Dods). In 1893 Denney was asked to deliver a series of theological lectures at Chicago Theological Seminary. These were published in 1894 under the title Studies in Theology. Some of his statements on the nature of the Bible were objected to, but otherwise the book was recognised as an important work. Denney was also awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Chicago. Academic career Denney was appointed Professor of Systematic Theology at his old alma mater, Free Church College Glasgow, in 1897, and spent the rest of his life teaching there. In 1900 he transferred to Professor Bruce's old Chair of New Testament Language and Literature, which he held until his death in 1917. In 1915 he was appointed principal of the college, the first former student of the institution to receive that honour. Denney became a close friend of the one-time Free Church minister and journalist Sir William Robertson Nicoll, to whose publications he contributed liberally dozens of articles. His wife died in 1907 and Denney felt the loss deeply, from which he never recovered, writing only two major works before his death in the summer of 1917 at the comparatively early age of 61. Theological position Denney's greatest contribution to theological literature is in his robust defence of the penal character of the atonement. First expressed in his Studies in Theology, it found its fullest expression in his 1902 work The Death of Christ (London, Hodder and Stoughton, often reprinted), and its follow-up (in later editions included as an appendix in The Death of Christ), The Atonement and the Modern Mind. Denney insists that the death of Christ cannot be understood unless it is seen as a death for sin, as Christ bearing the penalty in the place of those he came to save. He strongly resisted any attempt to drive a wedge between the substitutionary and ethical aspects of the atonement. In his last book, published posthumously, The Christian Doctrine of Reconciliation, Denney returned to the doctrine of the atonement, but this time, to the surprise of others, he modified his previous views, presenting a '\\"mellow\\" utterance on the great theme'.R Mackintosh, Historic Theories of Atonement, p. 284-5: 'Denney began to modify, to qualify his statements, to explain that his real meaning was different. [...] Denney had already repudiated \\"forensic \\" or \\"legal\\" or \\"juridical\\" views of Atonement. One must press the question, Is the death of Christ penal or is it not ? The posthumous volume answers, \\"In one sense\\" it is, but \\"not in another.\\"' Writings In addition to his academic oeuvre, he made dozens of contributions to journals and newspapers ranging from erudite theological journals to The Morning Watch, a Sunday-school magazine edited by his friend J.

It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List as habitat conversion and destruction may cause the population to decline in the future. It is also known as Pantanal cat and colocolo in parts of its range. It is named after the Pampas, but occurs in grassland, shrubland, and dry forest at elevations up to . There was a proposal to divide Pampas cat into three distinct species, based primarily on differences in pelage colour/pattern and cranial measurements. Accordingly, three species were recognised in the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World: the colocolo (L. colocolo), the Pantanal cat (L. braccatus), and the Pampas cat (L. pajeros) with a more restricted definition. This split at species level was not supported by subsequent phylogeographic analysis, although some geographical substructure was recognised, and some authorities continue to recognise the Pampas cat as a single species. In the 2017 revision of felid taxonomy by the Cat Specialist Group, the Pampas cat is recognized as a single species with seven subspecies. A further study released in 2020, found strong evidence for five distinct species within the Pampas cat complex. Characteristics The Pampas cat is a little bigger than a domestic cat and has a bushier tail. Its size varies between regions, ranging in body length from with a long tail. Six variants of its pelage occur, but all have two dark lines on the cheeks: * Type 1. Reddish or dark grey with rusty-cinnamon stripes on the flanks, a cinnamon upper side of the ears with black edges and tips, four or five reddish rings on the tail (outer two are darker), dark brown stripes on the legs, black chest spots, and whitish underparts with rusty-ochraceous stripes. This type occurs in central Chile in subtropical, xerophytic forests at altitudes of up to . * Type 2A. Flanks with large, reddish-brown, rosette-shaped spots with darker borders, numerous rings on the tail (of the same colour as the flank spots), and very dark brown, almost black stripes on the legs with spots or stripes on the underparts. This type occurs in the northern Andes in the subspecies L. c. thomasi and L. c. wolffsohni. * Type 2B resembles Type 2A, but the background colour is paler, and the body markings, stripes on the hind legs, and rings on the tail are paler and less distinct. * Type 2C is overall greyish with distinct dark brown stripes on the legs and spots on the underparts, a plain tail (no clear rings), and at most indistinct dark lines on the flanks. * Type 3A is almost entirely rusty-brown with faint spots, continuous bands, an unbanded tail with a prominent black tip, and all-black feet. This pattern is found in the subspecies L. c. braccatus. * Type 3B is similar to type 3A, but the background color is paler and more yellowish, with flank spots that are browner and more distinct, feet that are only black on the soles, and discontinuous rings and a narrow black tip on the tail. This type occurs in the subspecies L. c. munoai. The subtypes of Type 2 show variation according to altitude and latitude. Only the first subtype occurs in the north (around 20¬∞S and northwards), and only the third type occurs in the far south (around 40¬∞S and southwards). In between, the majority are of second subtype, but the first subtype has been recorded as far south as 29¬∞S, and the third subtype as far north as 36¬∞S. At latitudes where both the first and second subtypes are found, the former tends to occur in highlands and the latter in lowlands. Taxonomy Felis colocola was the scientific name proposed by Juan Ignacio Molina in 1782 for a cat from Chile. Skulls An extensive morphological analysis of Pampas cat specimens from across the species's range revealed differences in cranial measurements, and pelage colour and pattern. Therefore, the Pampas cat group was divided into three distinct species with 11 subspecies. This species division was recognised in the 2005 edition of Mammal Species of the World, although the number of subspecies was reduced: *Leopardus colocola (colocolo) **L. c. colocola ‚Äì subtropical forests of central Chile **L. c. wolffsohni (Garcia-Perea, 1994) ‚Äì in spiny shrublands and p√°ramo of northern Chile *Leopardus braccatus (Pantanal cat) ** L. b. braccatus (Cope, 1889) ‚Äì central Brazil, eastern Paraguay, extreme eastern Bolivia, and parts of north-eastern Argentina. ** L. b. munoai (Ximenez, 1961) ‚Äì Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, and Uruguay. *Leopardus pajeros (Pampas cat, with a more restricted definition) **L. p. pajeros (Desmarest, 1816), the Nominate subspecies ‚Äì southern Chile and widely in Argentina **L. p. crespoi ‚Äì eastern slope of the Andes in northwestern Argentina **L. p. garleppi (Matschie, 1912) ‚Äì Andes in Peru **L. p. steinbachi ‚Äì Andes in Bolivia **L. p. thomasi ‚Äì Andes in Ecuador Based on just two specimens, the subspecies L. p. steinbachi is larger and paler than L. p. garleppi. However, this is labelled with uncertainty due to the very small sample, and some treat it as a synonym of L. p. garleppi. Uncertainty also exists for the subspecies L. p. budini, which appears to resemble L. p. crespoi, and was described from lowlands of northwestern Argentina, but may actually be from humid forests in the region. Some recognise it, while others do not. Populations in southern Chile and the southern part of Argentina, included in the nominate in the above list, were recognised as the subspecies L. p. crucinus based on its dull pelage and large size. More recent work, primarily genetic studies, failed to find support for a split at species level, although some geographical substructure was recognized. Several authors recognise the Pampas cat as a single species. Since 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group recognises the Pampas cat as a single species with seven subspecies: *L. c. colocola *L. c. pajeros *L. c. braccatus *L. c. garleppi *L. c. budini (Pocock, 1941) *L. c. munoai *L. c. wolffsohni Authors of a study published in May 2020 found significant morphological, molecular, geographic, and ecological differences between various Pampas cat populations across South America. They propose five species within the Pampas cat species complex, namely L. colocola, L. braccatus, L. garleppi, L. munoai and L. pajeros. They consider all five species to be monotypic. Distribution and habitat A Pampas cat museum specimen The Pampas cat ranges throughout most of Argentina and Uruguay into the Gran Chaco and Cerrado of Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and north through the Andes mountain chain through Ecuador and possibly marginally into southwestern Colombia. It occurs in a wide range of habitats and inhabits elevations between in p√°ramo, marginally also in puna grassland and locally in dry forest. Where its range overlaps with the Andean mountain cat in northwestern Argentina, it occurs at lower elevations on average. In central to northwestern Argentina, the Pampas cat is found at elevations below in grassland, mesophytic and dry forest, and shrubland. In southern Argentina and far southern Chile, it is found in Patagonian steppes and shrubland at altitudes below . In 2016 it was recorded for the first time in the Sechura Desert and in the dry forest of northwestern Peru.Garcia-Olaechea, A. and Hurtado, C. M. 2016. Pampas Cat conservation in northwestern Peru. Small Wild Cat Conservation News 2 : 18. Ecology and behaviour Little is known about the Pampas cat's hunting and breeding habits. It is thought to prey mainly on small mammals and birds. Guinea pigs are thought to form a large part of its diet, along with viscachas, other rodents, and the ground-dwelling tinamou order of birds. Though some have suggested it is chiefly nocturnal, others suggest it is mainly diurnal.MacDonald, D., Loveridge, A., eds. (2010). The Biology and Conservation of Wild Felids. Oxford University Press. Litters are relatively small, usually consisting of only one or two kittens, and occasionally three. The kittens weigh around at birth. The average lifespan is nine years, but some have lived for over 16 years.

It feeds on small mammals such as cavies, ground-dwelling birds, small lizards, and snakes. Home ranges are between . Hybrids between the Pantanal cat and oncilla are known from Brazil.  Taxonomic history  In 1994, it was suggested that its distinct pelage colour, pattern and cranial measurements warrant a specific status. But results of phylogeographic analysis did not support this. The validity of the genetic work has been questioned. Others regarded it as \\"likely [a] distinct species\\". In 2017, it was considered a subspecies of the Pampas cat by IUCN assessors. In 2020, it was further recognized as a full species based on morphological, molecular, geographical, and ecological differences.

Stewart played over 500 games and scored over 250 goals in his professional career and had notable spells in the Premier League for Ipswich Town and Sunderland, and was the Premier League's second highest goalscorer for the 2000‚Äì01 season. He also played for Bristol Rovers, Huddersfield Town, Bristol City, Preston North End, Yeovil Town and Exeter City. Playing career Stewart signed for Bristol Rovers in 1991, where he played as a regular striker until 1996 when he signed for Huddersfield Town, the team that had beaten Bristol Rovers in the play-off final the season before. He was a great fan favourite at Huddersfield before being controversially sold to rivals Ipswich Town in the final run in at the end of the 1999‚Äì2000 season.Fans Angrily Confront Town Chairman Ipswich were promoted to the Premier League at the end of the season ahead of Huddersfield due in no small part to Stewart's goals, with two crucially coming in the 2‚Äì2 draw at Bolton Wanderers in the Play-off semi-final away leg, and he then scored another in the Play-off Final itself. He continued his great form for the next season being the Premier League's second top goalscorer (and the division's highest English goalscorer) during 2000‚Äì01 with 19 goals for Ipswich, who finished fifth and qualified for the UEFA Cup and leading for many fans to call for him to be included in the England team. The following season saw Ipswich suffer a fall from grace that resulted in relegation, and although Stewart only notched up six league goals, he was still the team's OPTA player of the year for the second successive year. Following Ipswich's fall from the Premier League, Stewart signed for Sunderland where he had three successful seasons. He played his last game for Sunderland on 8 May 2005, after a successful last season for the club which saw him score 17 goals. He departed Sunderland in good terms after deciding that he was too old to play to a Premiership standard. He chose to sign for Bristol City, fulfilling his ambition to play for the team which he has supported since he was a boy despite beginning his career with City's neighbours and rivals Bristol Rovers. In March 2006, Stewart moved on-loan to Preston North End until the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. After his return to Bristol he was publicly told by City's manager and chairman that he should seek another club, though he was not formally transfer-listed. In August 2006 he signed for Yeovil Town on a 3-month loan and scored a goal on his debut away at Swansea City. He signed a permanent deal with Yeovil in January 2007.Slade Lifted by Stewart Signing Stewart signed a deal with newly promoted League Two side Exeter City on 14 July 2008. In February 2009 he was a shock contender to fill the vacant manager's position at Yeovil Town, possibly teaming up with ex-Carlisle United boss John Ward. Stewart finished the 2008/2009 season scoring 7 goals for Exeter, taking his career tally to 249 goals, one short of 250. After Exeter's promotion to league one in May 2009, Stewart decided to hold his retirement plans and sign a new one-year deal with the club. He scored his 250th career goal in the League One game at Carlisle United on 22 August 2009. Stewart retired from professional football in April 2011, his final appearance being as a substitute for Exeter in a 2‚Äì0 win against the first club of his career, Bristol Rovers. Coaching career Stewart, already has been involved in some coaching duties as a senior player/coach role in his final two years at Exeter City. After retiring from his playing career, he worked full-time as a first team coach for Exeter. In July 2012 he joined former club Bristol Rovers as a development coach. In 2013 Stewart was made assistant manager at Bristol Rovers. He left the club by mutual consent in December 2018 along with then manager Darrell Clarke. On 20 May 2019, Stewart re-united with Clarke by joining Walsall as assistant manager.

Allen, The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants‚Äù. , 1975 Description Members of the genus Passerina are ericoid shrubs or shrublets, often with a tendency to having pendulous branches. Their leaves are markedly decussate. They are concave or closely involute, lined with woolly hairs, and cling to leafy stems without being large enough to cover them. This gives the plants a characteristic plaited or corded appearance. The flowers of some species are borne in terminal spikes, whereas other species bear them in a four-flowered head. Bracts, usually broader than leaves and larger than the flowers, subtend each flower. This is one helpful distinction between specimens of Passerina and plants in the genus Struthiola. The calyx has four sepals, forming a flask- shaped or subcylindrical tube. At the mouth the sepals spread into lobes that are shorter than the tube. There are no petals, but the lobes of the sepals are quite colourfully petal-like in many species. The ovary is ovoid with a single loculus containing a solitary ovule. The style is lateral, bearing a mop-like stigma that fills the mouth of the calyx-tube. The calyx is persistent and encloses the fruit except in species such as Passerina ericoides, in which the fruit is berry-like and expands until it protrudes out of the tube. A flower bears eight stamens of unequal length, the longest being the length of the calyx-lobes, but all protrude out of the calyx. The flowers lack of any noticeable scent, their protruding stamens, and their mop-like stigmata suggest their adaptation to wind pollination, in contrast to the petals and night scent of Struthiola. In most species the fruit is membranous, but some species, e.g. Passerina ericoides have a fleshy pericarp, forming a red berry attractive to birds and tortoises, hence one of its common names, \\"skilpadbessie\\", meaning \\"tortoise berry\\". However, that name also is applied to other plants, such as Nylandtia spinosa. The seeds have a black, crustaceous testa and curved, beak-like micropyle. As in the related Struthiola, the beak-like aspects of the fruit inspired the name \\"Passerina\\", which is from the Latin passerinus, meaning \\"sparrow-like\\". Distribution The genus is endemic to Southern Africa, most species within South Africa, though some extend north of the border. The greatest concentration of species is in Cape fynbos, where some species are endemic to very small regions. Passerina ericoides for example occurs naturally only on the Cape Peninsula and the vicinity of False Bay List of species There are some 20 accepted species in the genus Passerina plus about sixty unresolved and over 100 synonyms. The following are the accepted species, omitting subspecies.The Plant List (2013). Version 1.1.

The attractive ericoid habit and fuss-free growth make it a useful subject in informal fynbos gardens. Being wind-pollinated, the plants generally are not of much importance to pollinating organisms such as bees and birds. The Khoisan name gonna refers to the use of its tough bark, together with that of related plants, for binding such items as thatch. The material certainly is remarkably tough and has been used for plaiting into whip thongs. The Khoisan use of a decoction of some species for treating pain, plus the fact that many species of the Thymelaeaceae suggests that the material might be pharmacologically active, but there is no suggestion that the plants cause harm to stock. However, this harmlessness might well be for the same reason that the plants generally are of no value as forage for browsers, namely that they are unpalatable to stock.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub.

It is also known as brown rust and it is the most important rust disease on barley.  Symptoms  Pustules of leaf rust are small and circular, producing a mass of orange-brown powdery spores. They appear on the leaf sheaths and predominantly on the upper leaf surfaces. Heavily infected leaves die prematurely.  Disease cycle  Crop losses  Leaf rust of barley is considered a relatively minor disease in the United States. However, sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the southeastern and Midwestern regions of the country.  Pathotypes and host resistance  Most of the barley cultivars grown in the United States are susceptible to Puccinia hordei. Nineteen seedling resistance genes (i.e. Rph1 to Rph19) have been identified, but only three (Rph3, 7 and 9) have been deployed in commercial cutlivars worldwide. In the United States, the Rph7 gene effectively controlled the disease for over twenty years. However, in 1993, pathotypes with virulence to the Rph7 resistance gene were identified in Virginia, California, and Pennsylvania. Recently, the first simply inherited gene conferring adult plant resistance to leaf rust in barley was designated Rph20. Rph20 originated from the two-rowed barley landrace H. laevigatum (i.e., Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare); parent of the Dutch cultivar 'Vada' (released in the 1950s). To date there have been no reports of an Rph20-virulent pathotype.

Luckily Tim Means (environmentalist), founder of Baja Expeditions, who since 1974 had been a leading conservationist based in La Paz, formed a coalition of activists who were able to purchase part of the island from the ejido that was selling it to the casino resort developer. One-third of the funds came from Mexican funders, another third from American funders via the Nature Conservancy, and the rest through an anonymous gift to the World Wildlife Fund.

The mosque is built above a raised platform. The three domed mosque above the platform, now transformed into a multi-storied structure was originally a copy of Shaista Khan's another three domed mosque at the Mitford Hospital compound near the Buriganga River. There are some square-shaped rooms maybe built for Imam and for students of the madrasa. Today the original building design has been lost most of its original form through multiple renovations and extensions. Interior & exterior design The central Mihrab The three domes The promenade around the three domed prayer chamber, since there was no separate structure for study purpose, might have been used for open-air classes and the vaulted room with book-shelves on their walls underneath the platform may have been designed to provide residential accommodation for those who used to teach and study here.

Lejonstedts Gr√§nd is an alley in Gamla stan, the old town in central stockholm, Sweden. Stretching from Stora Nygatan to M√§lartorget and crossed by Lilla Nygatan, it forms a parallel street to Tyska Brinken and Kornhamnstorg. It is named after the Country marshal (lantmarskalk) and Councillor of the Realm Anders Lejonstedt (1649‚Äì1725). Lejonstedt who before knighthood was named Volimhaus, owned the block taking up the north-eastern part of the street in the late-17th century together with his brother Jakob (ennobled Gyllenborg) . History Together with its neighbourhood, the alley is a product of the reconstruction of the western part of the old town following the great fire of 1625. Before this, the unregulated urban structure of the city stretched down from V√§sterl√•nggatan to the eastern part of the alley, down to the shore. This area was unsuitable for any major construction and used mostly for sheds and for the city's defence. (including maps of the assumed extension of the medieval walls) While the extent of the 14th-century city wall is not well documented, the area formed a part of the south-western harbour area where agricultural goods delivered from the Lake M√§laren area were unloaded (which gave the present square Kornhamnstorg its name). During the period 1543‚Äì1553, a new wooden defensive structure was built along the western shore, which, however, burnt down after only two years. This was replaced by new defences built in brick and stone, but these were outdated within 50 years and completely demolished after the fire of 1625.

He was named after his paternal grandfather Antipater the Idumaean. He and his mother were exiled after Herod divorced her between 43 BC and 40 BC to marry Mariamne I. However, he was recalled following Mariamne's fall in 29 BC and in 13 BC Herod made him his first heir in his will. He retained this position even when Alexander and Aristobulus (Herod's sons by Mariamne) rose in the royal succession in 12 BC, and even became exclusive successor to the throne after their execution in 7 BC (with Herod II in second place). However, in 5 BC Antipater was brought before Publius Quinctilius Varus, then Roman governor of Syria, charged with the intended murder of his father Herod. Antipater was found guilty by Varus; however, due to Antipater's high rank, it was necessary for Caesar Augustus to approve of the recommended sentence of death. After the guilty verdict, Antipater's position as exclusive successor was removed and granted to Herod Antipas. Once the sentence had approval from Augustus in 4 BC, Antipater was then executed, and Archelaus (from the marriage with Malthace) was made heir in his father's will as king over Herod's entire kingdom (with Antipas and Philip as Tetrarchs over certain territories). Concerning Antipater's execution following on the heel of Herod's executions a couple of years before of his sons Alexander and Aristobulus, it would be recounted in the compendium Saturnalia (compiled by Macrobius) that Augustus remarked \\"It is better to be Herod's pig than his son.\\" We know two of Antipater's wives through the writings of Josephus. First was his niece Mariamne III, daughter of Aristobulus IV.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter 1:2; see http://www.ccel.org/j/josephus/works/ant-17.htm The second was a high-ranking Hasmonean princess whose first name is lost to history. She was the daughter of Antigonus the Hasmonean, the last Hasmonean king who also served as high priest. This wife of Antipater was also a first cousin of Mariamne I, renowned royal wife of Herod the Great. Josephus records that she was at the palace with Doris, Antipater's mother, in support of her husband during his trial before Varus in 5 BC.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVII, Chapter 5:2. In literature In Robert Graves' King Jesus, Graves puts forth the idea that Antipater secretly married Mary, who was of a royal Jewish line. The marriage served to strengthen the position of Antipater among Herod's many sons as future King of the Jews. Antipater was killed by his father five days before Herod's own death according to Josephus. According to Graves, a pregnant Mary is compelled to pretend to marry an old, pious carpenter, Joseph, to protect herself and the unborn Jesus.Graves, Robert King Jesus, ch. 5 passim Author Joseph Raymond supports this hypothesis as a fact.

Life and career Stafford-Clark was born in Cambridge, England, the son of Dorothy Crossley (Oldfield) and David Stafford- Clark, a physician. He was educated at Felsted School in England and Riverdale Country School in New York City, followed by Trinity College, Dublin. His directing career began as associate director of the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh, in 1966. He became artistic director there from 1968 to 1970. He was director of the Traverse Theatre Workshop Company from 1970 to 1974. Stafford-Clark co-founded the Joint Stock Theatre Company in 1974. Joint Stock worked with writers using company research to inspire workshops. From these workshops, writers such as David Hare, Howard Brenton and Caryl Churchill would garner material to inspire a writing phase before rehearsals began. This methodology is sometimes referred to as The Joint Stock Method. Productions during this period included Hare's Fanshen (1975), Brenton's Epsom Downs and Churchill's Cloud Nine (1979) which Stafford-Clark directed, as well as The Speakers, a promenade production.Philip Roberts and Max Stafford-Clark, Taking Stock: the Theatre of Max Stafford-Clark, 2007 From 1979 to 1993, he was artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre. He remains to date the Court's longest serving artistic director. In a difficult period for new writing, he helped nurture emerging playwrights including Andrea Dunbar, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels and Jim Cartwright. His regular collaborators on his productions included the singer Ian Dury. During this time the theatre's productions included Victory by Howard Barker, The Arbor by Andrea Dunbar, Insignificance by Terry Johnson, Our Country's Good by Timberlake Wertenbaker and Rat in the Skull by Ron Hutchinson. Perhaps the most important commission and production of this era was Top Girls by Caryl Churchill (1982). He has staged productions for Happy Days Enniskillen International Beckett Festival. In 1993, he founded the Out of Joint touring company with producer Sonia Friedman. He was its artistic director until 2017 when he was succeeded by Kate Wasserberg. He left the company after complaints were made about a tendency to make lewd remarks to women. The emergence of this issue in October 2017 led to further accusations of inappropriate sexual comments, going back several decades. The actress Tracy-Ann Oberman was among those who contacted The Guardian to relate their experience, taking the number of women who had made complaints about Stafford-Clark to five. Academic credits include an honorary doctorate from Oxford Brookes University and Professorships at the University of Warwick and the University of Hertfordshire. Personal life Stafford-Clark and Carole Hayman were married in 1971; after that marriage was dissolved, he and Ann Pennington wed, in 1981. During a six-month period in 2006 and 2007, Stafford- Clark suffered three strokes, which left him physically disabled and impaired his eyesight. Stafford-Clark's experience, and the condition of the NHS, inspired Irish playwright Stella Feehily (the couple married in 2010) to write the play This May Hurt a Bit, first performed in 2014. He has one daughter, Kitty Stafford-Clark, from his second marriage. Sexual harassment allegations In July 2017, an employee of Stafford-Clark's Out of Joint theatre company made a formal complaint about his behavior; an investigation followed, and he was asked to leave the company. Stafford-Clark stepped down in September 2017; in the weeks that followed, three more women stated that he had \\"made lewd comments to them.\\"  Legacy  In 1999 the British Library acquired Stafford-Clark's papers consisting of production diaries and rehearsal scripts covering his time with the Joint Stock Theatre Company, the English Stage Company at the Royal Court Theatre, and Out of Joint theatre company.Max Stafford-Clark Papers, archives and manuscripts catalogue, the British Library.

Although it is not known which one, it is known that in his youth he went to university and achieved a Licentiate in the Arts.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 116. Career He was made Dean of Brechin Cathedral in 1350,Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 43. leaving this post in 1352 to become Archdeacon of Aberdeen.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 18. It was the later position that enabled him, after the death of Bishop John de Rate in either late 1354 or early 1355, to be elected as the new Bishop of Aberdeen.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 115; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 43. Upon receiving the request for confirmation by the new bishop and the chapter of Aberdeen, the Pope declared that he had previously reserved the see for his own choice and declared the election void. The Pope nevertheless supported the decision of the chapter and appointed Alexander as bishop on 4 December 1355. He was consecrated before 12 July 1356; according to Hector Boece, this took place at Perth in the presence of the king.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 115 Boece also wrote that King David II of Scotland had written to the chapter of Aberdeen requesting that they elect a French follower of his by the name of Nicholas, but that the chapter refused to accommodate this suggestion. Pawn Alexander was one of the proctors appointed for the ransom of King David in 1357, after the latter had been taken as a hostage by the English crown at the Battle of Neville's Cross eleven years earlier. In 1362, King David granted the bishopric some land in the County of Banff to augment the income of a canon who in return would say mass for the souls of King David and his ancestors. Bishop Alexander died on 29 July 1380, and was buried before the altar of Aberdeen Cathedral. According to Hector Boece, he was at Scone when he died.

Gardiner was born and raised in Chelsea in London. He was the younger son of Clive Gardiner, painter and principal of Goldsmiths College from 1929 to 1958, and Lilian Lancaster, also a painter and one of Walter Sickert's favourite pupils at the Slade. His paternal grandfather was the journalist A. G. Gardiner. His elder brother, Patrick Gardiner, became a professor of philosophy at the University of Oxford. He was educated at Dulwich College, and served in the Royal Navy from 1942. He studied at the Architectural Association and qualified as an architect in 1948. He then worked for Wells Coates, then for short periods with Richard Blow and Peter Dickinson, and with Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew. He worked with Richard Sheppard from 1951 to 1957, working mainly on schools. He founded his own practice in 1957, and was in partnership with Christopher Knight in the 1960s. Perhaps his crowning achievement was designing a new house at Stratton Park in Hampshire for Sir John Baring, replacing a late 18th-century house by George Dance with a modern building largely in brick with a steel conservatory. The original building was demolished, but the Tuscan portico was left standing as an architectural feature in front of the house. He also worked on many school buildings in and around London. He became a business partner of Joan Scotson in 1970, who later became his wife. He received the OBE in 2002 for his contribution to community architecture. Concerned at the precarious nature of his profession, and the number of projects that were never built, he also taught architecture. He taught at the Architectural Association from 1955 to 1956, and at the Oxford School of Architecture (now part of Oxford Brookes University) from 1957 to 1968, at the University of Westminster from 1970 to 1974, at Washington University in St Louis in 1978, at Cheltenham College from 1979 to 1981, and at the University of London from 1981 to 1986. Gardiner was also a writer. He wrote a thriller, Death is an Artist in 1958. He wrote for the London Magazine for 37 years, from 1964 to 2001, and was architectural correspondent for The Observer for 23 years, writing a weekly column from 1970 to 1993. He also wrote for The Spectator, The Times, the Architectural Review, and the RIBA Journal. He also wrote several books on architectural subjects, including Evolution of the House (1974), a monograph on Le Corbusier (Fontana Modern Masters, 1974), Kuwait: The Making of a City (1984) and The House: Its Origins and Evolution (2002). He wrote two biographies, Epstein: Artist Against the Establishment (1992), and Frink, a life of the sculptor Elisabeth Frink (1997). Le Corbusier was a significant influence on his professional work, and he knew both Jacob Epstein and Elisabeth Frink. He also published poetry, and exhibited paintings and drawings. He married four times. His first marriage, to Shirley Warwick, second marriage, to Lucy Ward, and third marriage, to Shirley Blomfield, all ended in divorce. He married Joan Scotson in 1979, living on the King's Road in Chelsea until 2002, when they moved to Tunbridge Wells. He died at Pembury in Kent. He was survived by his fourth wife, and a son and daughter from his third marriage.

It is one of six species of blue-tongued skinks found in Australia, though further species are found in New Guinea and Indonesia. The western blue-tongued lizard grows to around 45 cm (18 in) in length. It has a brown, banded pattern across the body and tail; the underside of the body is usually pale. It has distinctive black markings to the rear of each eye. The body is wide and large in comparison to the size of the legs. As its name suggests, it has a blue tongue, which contrasts with the pink interior of its mouth. When threatened, it may open its mouth and stick out its tongue in a threat display. If the initial display is unsuccessful, and the predator or threat does not retreat, it may hiss and flatten out its body in an attempt to make itself look bigger. ... It is diurnal, hunting for insects, spiders, and snails, and foraging for plants (particularly berries) and carrion. It is not an agile lizard, so its prey tends to be slow-moving. It has powerful jaws which allow it break up snail shells and the exoskeletons of beetles. It is found in grasslands, dunes, shrublands, and sparse woodlands. It rests under leaf litter or rocks at night, and sometimes uses abandoned rabbit burrows for shelter. Blue- tongued lizards are popular pets and can live for up to 30 years in captivity, though the western blue-tongued lizard is extremely uncommon as a pet, as it is one of the rarer species. They give birth to approximately 5 live young. The young consume the placental membrane immediately after birth, and are precocious and disperse after a few days. They have bands of yellow and brown on their bodies and tails. The western blue-tongued lizard is found chiefly in Western Australia. It is restricted to the far south in the Northern Territory, and divided into an eastern and western population in South Australia.

Arnold, who is also an amateur bodybuilder, initially gained notoriety as \\"the Father of Prohormones.\\"Henry K. Lee (August 4, 2006) Inventor of 'clear' steroid gets 3 months in prison, The San Francisco Chronicle  Life and early career  Arnold grew up in Guilford, Connecticut. At age 11 he started working out after his father gave him a set of weights. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, despite following protein diets, he grew frustrated with his inability to put on much muscle mass. According to his version of events, Arnold's first contact with steroids happened when \\"a guy in a gym got him a cheap counterfeit steroid that contained just enough methyltestosterone that it added 10 pounds of muscle in all the right places.\\" This sparked his interest in chemistry, and in 1990 Arnold graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of New Haven.George Dohrmann (October 09, 2006) Is This Dr. Evil? A legend in the sports netherworld, chemist Patrick Arnold-- inventor of THG--breaks his silence on his role in the BALCO scandal and hints of a future filled with scary science , Sports Illustrated After graduation Arnold took a lab job in New Jersey that allowed him enough free time to research performance enhancers. He also took classes on organic synthesis at the University of Connecticut and Montclair State, and \\"devoured\\" books on supplements and steroids, studying both approved and unapproved Western drugs and those used by the East Germans in their doping heyday. In 1996 he befriended Dan Duchaine, who introduced Arnold to Stan Antosh, the owner of Osmo Therapy, a supplement company then based in San Francisco. Antosh persuaded Arnold to move his research to a small company in Seymour, Illinois, called Bar North America, which was owned by Ramlakhan Boodram. In Seymour, Arnold reviewed old patents looking for drugs that had never made it to market or were used only briefly. Later that year he introduced androstenedione to the North American market, which became successful after Mark McGwire was found using it. But because their company didn't sell andro directly to consumers -- but only as an ingredient to other supplement makers -- Arnold missed out on a financial windfall. In 2001 Arnold's company introduced the prohormone 1-Androstenediol, under the marketing name 1-AD. Like andro, 1-AD is a prohormone that is easily converted by the body into 1-testosterone, and it sold well. But the boom was short-lived. In January '05 an amendment to the federal Controlled Substance Act banned prohormones. The company lost 60% of their sales, and became unprofitable. According to Arnold, Victor Conte contacted him in 2000 seeking undetectable drugs. Arnold offered norbolethone, which he had synthesized in 1998. About this new venture Arnold recalls \\"I didn't feel I was jumping into anything more than [a potential problem] with a sports governing body,\\" and attributes his motivation for involvement to his curiosity about the responsiveness of well-trained athletes, as well as pride in his own work. In 2001 Arnold switched to providing Conte with tetrahydrogestrinone after norbolethone started to draw scrutiny from drug testers. Time in prison In 2006, Arnold was sentenced to three months in prison at Federal Correctional Institution, Morgantown in West Virginia followed by three months of house arrest for his role in the BALCO scandal.

Sinking of the colliery commenced in the late 1840s with production commencing towards the end of 1850. The colliery was owned by Earl Fizwilliam,Annals of Yorkshire (1852) by Henry Schroeder - pg 140 and was worked by Wakefield‚Äìbased agents J. & J. Charlesworth & Company. Coal was worked from two seams, the 5 ft. seam was worked at a depth of 90 yards, the 9 ft. seam being found at 127 yards. These seams were connected by a shaft. The colliery was rail connected to another Charlesworth operation, Kilnhurst Colliery and so to the main line railway (The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, Sheffield to Doncaster line). Some small buildings are still standing on the site (2007) and the track of the railway towards Kilnhurst is now a footpath. Following closure part of the site became the works of Bessacarr Caravans.  Early accident  The colliery had been operating for less than a year when, in December 1851 an accident took place. The Underground Steward went to inspect the workings just prior to the start of the day shift (around 6 a.m.) and was followed shortly afterwards by the miners. About an hour later an explosion took place which \\"astounded not only those at the pit but the whole neighbourhood\\". Two corves (small tubs of coal), one filled with 16 cwts.(approx. 1650 kg) of coal and one empty, were propelled skyward out of the shaft and became entangled in the headgear. Another report pointed out that \\"Some idea may be formed of the effect of the explosion, when it is stated that a man standing at a door of a cottage, upwards of a mile distant, was completely blackened!\\" By 9.30 a.m. repairs had been effected to the headgear to enable access to the mine and 14 injured men and boys were lifted out. By mid-afternoon a further 24 men and boys were brought out alive with the first of those killed. The cause of the explosion, which took place in the northern end of the 9 ft. seam, was cited as a roof fall which blocked the air flow and caused a buildup of foul air which was forced into areas where the miners were working with candles to give light. In total 51 persons were killed, 24 of these being 16 years or below. In some cases these were fathers and sons, working together. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death and commented in his summing up of the lack of inspectors for coal mines, there being only 4 of these in the country, and suggested that the Government should increase this number as soon as possible for the benefit and safety of the workers involved in the industry.

It is above sea level. Chimney Tops is a double-capstone knob on the eastern slope of the Sugarland Mountain massif, which stretches north-south across the north- central section of the Smokies. Mount Le Conte resides east of Chimney Tops, and Mt. Mingus southeast of Chimney Tops. Thus, while the view from the summit is 360 degrees, Chimney Tops is practically \\"walled in\\" on three sides. Geology Chimney Tops is one of the few instances of a bare rock summit in the Smokies. The bedrock atop the mountain has been exposed to natural weathering of the upper layers of soil strata. The bedrock is mostly Anakeesta Formation metamorphic rock, especially slate, phyllite, and metasiltsone. It was formed 200 million years ago when the North American and African plates collided during the Appalachian orogeny.Moore, Harry (1988). pp. 26‚Äì27. History The lower capstone of Chimney Tops, looking north from the higher capstone. The Cherokee name for Chimney Tops is Duniskwalgunyi, or \\"forked antler\\", referring to its resemblance to the deer antlers.. In the Cherokee legend \\"Aganunitsi and the Uktena\\", the captured medicine man, Aganunitsi, to free himself, searches remote parts of the Smokies to find the giant reptile, the Uktena, and seize an amulet from its forehead. In his quest, Aganunitsi searches distant gaps and peaks in the Smokies before going to Duniskwalgunyi, the Gap of the Forked Antler, and to the lake of Atagahi, and at each found monstrous reptiles.\\"Mooney, James (1972) p. 299. Folded metamorphic rock characterizes the capstones of Chimney Tops. The Road Prong Trail, which follows the stream of the same name at the base of Chimney Tops, is one of the oldest trails in the Smokies. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this ancient path was known commonly as the Indian Gap Trail. In 1832, the Oconaluftee Turnpike was constructed between Indian Gap and Smokemont. This road was expanded during the Civil War by Cherokee leader Col. Will Thomas, running parallel to the modern trail. The mountain's current name was probably given to it by residents of the Sugarlands, a valley to the north of the mountain that was home to a small Appalachian community before the national park was formed. Before the Sugarlands was reforested, Chimney Tops was clearly visible from most of the valley. Local legend even suggested that the top of the mountain was covered in soot. Access Sugarland Mountain, looking northwest from the summit of Chimney Tops. A common route to closely see the peaks is the Chimney Tops Trail, which can be accessed about 6.9 miles south/east of the Sugarlands Visitor Center on Newfound Gap Road. Before the summit part of the trail was closed, the trail ended at the foot of the south capstone (the higher of the two), but various unmaintained spurs crossed over to the lower summit. Another route is to follow the Appalachian Trail west from Newfound Gap to the Road Prong Trail. The Road Prong Trail, following the river at the base of the mountain, connects the Appalachian Trail with the Chimney Tops Trail. This route is twice as long as the route from the Chimney Tops parking lot. While no technical gear was needed, a climb was necessary to reach the capstones. From the summit, Mount Le Conte and Mount Kephart can be seen in the east, the Sugarland Mountain in the west and the Sugarlands valley in the north. A severe fire in late 2016 led to closure of many trails in the Great Smoky Mountains, including in the Chimney Tops area. The trail reopened in October 2017, with a new observation area that offers a place to view both of the bare rock points of the summit. However, due to the extreme heat of the fires, access to the summit is no longer permitted.Temporary Road and Facilities Closures, National Park Service website. Accessed: 16 March 2017.

Dedicated to the saints Bartholomew, Mark and John the Baptist, it was built between 1472 and 1476 as the personal shrine for the condottiere Bartolomeo Colleoni, a member of one of the most outstanding families of the city, and his beloved daughter Medea. The site chosen was that of the sacristy of the nearby church of Santa Maria Maggiore, which was demolished by Colleoni's soldiers. The design was entrusted to Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, whose plan respected the style of the church, as can be seen from the octagonal tambour of the dome and in the lantern cusp, as well as in the use of polychrome marbles. Overview The fa√ßade is characterized by the use of tarsia and polychrome marble decorations in white, red and black lozenges. Over the main portal is a rose window, flanked by two medallions portraying Julius Caesar and Trajan. The upper part of the basement has nine plaques with reliefs of Biblical stories, and four bas-reliefs with Hercules's deeds. The four pilasters of the windows flanking the portal are surmounted by statues of the Virtues. The upper part of the fa√ßade has a loggia in Romanesque style. The interior includes a square hall and a smaller room housing the high altar. The tomb of Bartolomeo Colleoni (who died on November 2, 1475) is on the wall facing the entrance. It is decorated with reliefs of Episodes from the Life of Christ, statues, heads of lions and an equestrian statue of the condottiere in gilded wood, finished by German masters from Nuremberg in 1501. The whole complex is surrounded by a triumphal arch. Amadeo himself executed the funerary monument of Medea Colleoni (died March 6, 1470). Located on the left wall, it has a statue of the Deposition from the Cross in high relief. The tomb was transferred here in 1892 from Basella di Urgnano. The presbytery has a high altar sculpted by Bartolomeo Manni in 1676, housing statues of the three saints to whom the chapel is dedicated, John, Mark and Bartholomew, by Pietro Lombardo. The upswept cornice is supported by Solomonic columns. The altar table, to a design by Leopoldo Pollack, is supported by angels carved by Grazioso Rusca. The altar by Bartolomeo Manni, incorporating earlier sculptures of saints by Pietro Lombardo Notable are the frescoes of the dome, depicting Episodes of the Lives of St. Mark, John the Baptist and Bartholomew, executed by Giambattista Tiepolo in 1732‚Äì1733. Bartolomeo Colleoni's remains For centuries it was believed that the condottiere's remains had been buried elsewhere, as the sarcophagus appeared empty. On November 21, 1969, however, they were discovered in Colleoni's tomb in a wooden coffin, hidden under a plaster cover. The funerary monument to Medea Colleoni, by Giovanni Antonio Amadeo.

Geography  Lake Elmenteita from the Nairobi-Nakuru highway Elmenteita is derived from the Maasai word muteita, meaning \\"dust place\\", a reference to the dryness and dustyness of the area, especially between January and March. The town of Gilgil is near the lake. In the south-to-north sequence of Rift Valley lakes, Elmenteita is between Lake Naivasha and Lake Nakuru. The major Nairobi-Nakuru highway (A104 Road) runs along the nearby escarpment affording motorists a spectacular vista towards the lake.Today the lake is a protected area due to its birdlife fame and also it has been named as one of the heritage sites together with the Lake Nakuru and Lake Bogoria by UNESCO. At the southern end of the lake are the \\"Kekopey\\" hot springs, in which an introduced fish, the Lake Magadi tilapia, breed. The reed beds nearby are fishing grounds for night herons and pelicans. Lake Elmenteita, as seen from space.  History  The Lake Elmenteita area saw its first white settlement when Lord Delamere (1879-1931) established Soysambu, a ranch, on the western side of the lake. Delamere gifted the land on the other side of the lake to his brother-in-law, the Honorable Galbraith Lowry Egerton Cole (1881-1929), part of whose \\"Kekopey Ranch\\", where he is buried, is preserved today as the Lake Elementaita Lodge. Soysambu ranch is still occupied by Lord Delamere's descendants, including the controversial Thomas P. G. Cholmondeley who has been instrumental in setting up the Soysambu conservancy. The conservancy covers 2/3 of the shoreline and is home to over 12000 wild animals. Lake Elmenteita has been a Ramsar site since 2005.  Ecology  Over 400 bird species have been recorded in the Lake Nakuru/Lake Elmenteita basin. Elmenteita attracts visiting flamingoes, both the greater and lesser varieties, which feed on the lake's crustacean and insect larvae and on its suspended blue-green algae, respectively. Lake Magadi tilapia were introduced to the lake from Lake Magadi in 1962 and since that time the flamingo population has dwindled considerably. The tilapia attract many fish-eating birds that also feed upon the flamingo eggs and chicks. Over a million birds that formerly bred at Elmenteita are now said to have sought refuge at Lake Natron in Tanzania. The lake's shores are grazed by zebra, gazelle, eland and families of warthog. The lake is normally very shallow (less than 1 m deep) and bordered by trona-encrusted mudflats during the dry seasons. During the late Pleistocene and early Holocene, Lake Elmenteita was at times united with an expanded Lake Nakuru, forming a much larger dilute lake. Remnants of the former joined lake are preserved as sediments at various locations around the lake basins, including former shorelines. Recently the lake level and number of flamingoes has receded as increased human activity has dried up catchment areas.Daily Nation, December 8, 2009: A lake lies on its deathbed  Associated sites  Nearby is the Kariandusi Museum, at an important prehistoric site where stone handaxes and cleavers were discovered in 1929 by Louis Leakey.

Origins and inspiration Mahomed Mosque at Dhaka (1885). Khan Mohammad Mirza mosque, an archaeological site located in southern Dhaka, near Lalbagh fort. The mosque rises above its surroundings because the tahkhana or underground rooms of the mosque are above grade. The roof of the tahkhana forms the platform on which the mosque is situated. The spacious prayer place before the main mosque is open in all directions allowing air to flow and keep the Musullis cool. Architecture and architect The domes on the mosque The main mosque where the Imam and a few Musullis are accommodated consists of three domes bears testimony of the architecture practiced during the sixteenth century. Two Persian inscriptions, one over the central archway and the other over the central Mihrab. According to an inscription found, the mosque was built during the rule of Deputy Governor of Dhaka, Farrukh Siyar, by a Khan Muhammad Mirza, who could have been the architect. The construction was orders by a Qazi Ibadullah during 1704‚Äì05 AD. The platform is 16'-6\\" above the ground level. The tahkhana comprises vaulted rooms for living purposes. The mosque is accessed from the east, up a flight of twenty-five steps. Area wise, the mosque occupies only a small portion of the platform. Prayer Hall The prayer hall is a rectangular structure measuring 48' x 24' and is capped by three domes, the central being the larger one. The smaller sizes of the side domes are achieved by using intermediary pendentives. The corners minarets are short and slender, rising just above the parapet and are capped by ribbed copulas. The annex to the north of the mosque serves as a madrasa or religious school and has a hujra or arcaded hall that is used for travelers and visitors. The facade of the mosque is decorated with paneling and ornamental merlons along the parapet. The entrances to the prayer hall are framed by multi-cusped arches and engaged columns on either side. Interior Tomb in front of the mosque The interior is divided into three bays by two lateral arches. Each bay contains a mihrab that is marked by multi-cusped arch within a rectangular panel. Gardens Various kinds of seasonal flowers are cultivated in the garden at the eastern portion making the compound a sight for sore eyes. A ‚ÄòMali‚Äô appointed by Department of Archaeology is in charge of the upkeep of the garden. A well in the northern portion of the garden once used for supplying water for ‚ÄòOzu‚Äô a way of becoming fresh before prayer is now abandoned. In the southern side of the garden stands a tall, old palm tree bearing the symbol of ancient for the place. Location and ownership This ancient structure can be beheld at 150 meter west on the road that goes beside Lalbag fort. The mosque being an architectural site of Dhaka city is also used as a mosque. Mutawalli of the mosque says, \\"Though the mosque is owned by the government as an archeological site and is being supervised by the Department of Archeology under Ministry of Cultural affairs there is lack of sincerity and transparency in the government intervention.\\" Restoration and controversies In 1913 the Archaeological Survey of India listed Mirza's Masjid as a historic monument; by then it had undergone alterations and appropriations that had to be demolished to restore it to its original form. The earliest photograph available on the mosque shows a ruined structure at the turn of the nineteenth century just before this early restoration attempt. Thereafter both the DOA and mosque committee have undertaken periodic repairs, some of which ignored the architectural and historic importance of the building. To compensate for the damaged drains and stop further deterioration the authority provided new outlets to drain rainwater out from the upper terrace (sahn); and improved water and sanitation services. The site experienced many encroachments that constricted the boundaries of the compound, which drew serious attention of the architects and other conservation enthusiasts when it was included as a case study in an architectural conservation workshop in 1989 in Dhaka, sponsored by the AKTC and UNDP. Conservation and criticism Conservation of invaluable heritage sites in the 400-year-old city of Dhaka has always been ignored, leading to destruction of the sites. Destruction of heritage sites and historical monuments started during Pakistan period on a moderate scale but it gained momentum after independence. Heritage properties suffered destruction in an appalling extent during military rule. According to conservationist architects, friezes and other ornamental features of the old buildings are replaced with dissimilar and odd-looking features. Details of the ornamental works, their sizes and proportions are lost in the intervention. According to conservationist architects, friezes and other ornamental features of the old buildings are replaced with dissimilar and odd-looking features.

The battle ended with a Serbian victory and prompted Ottoman Sultan Selim III to declare jihad (holy war) against the Serbs. Background In the 1790s, the Ottoman Sultan Selim III granted the Serbs in the Sanjak of Smederevo (central Serbia) the right to run their own affairs in exchange for their cooperation with the governor of Belgrade, Had≈æi Mustafa Pasha. Following the Slaughter of the Knezes in February 1804, a revolt led by Karaƒëorƒëe Petroviƒá erupted against the Ottoman janissary junta (the \\"Dahije\\") in Serbia. The Serbs initially received the support of Selim and managed to defeat the corrupt janissaries by the end of the year. Facing great pressure not to cooperate extensively with his Christian subjects, Selim began to view the Serbs as rebels by the spring of 1805. He appointed the Ottoman governor of Ni≈°, Hafiz Pasha, as the new governor of Belgrade and ordered him to confront the Serbian insurgents. The Ottoman Turkish forces were highly trained. Battle The village of Ivankovac is located near the town of ƒÜuprija. On , the Ottomans attacked the Serbian revolutionaries, commanded by Karaƒëorƒëe and Milenko Stojkoviƒá, at Ivankovac. Hafiz Pasha was seriously wounded during the battle and died as a result. The Ottomans were defeated.

It marked the first time that a regular Ottoman Turkish unit was defeated by Serbian revolutionaries during the First Serbian Uprising. The victory meant that the Serbian forces had taken full control of the Belgrade Pashaluk. Smederevo was captured in November and became the first capital of the Serbian revolutionary government, while Belgrade was taken the following year. Defeat in the battle prompted Selim to declare jihad (holy war) against the Serbian revolutionaries fighting to expel the Turks from Serbia.

It is similar in character to other tower houses located nearby, including Little Cumbrae Castle and Skelmorlie Castle, and is a category A listed building. It was built for Princess Mary, sister of King James III, as a wedding gift upon her marriage in 1467 to Thomas Boyd, Earl of Arran. In 1469 Thomas travelled to Denmark to escort James III's bride Margaret of Denmark, but he was forced to remain abroad as he and his father Lord Boyd were attainted for treason in 1469. The marriage was thereby annulled and Thomas died a few years later, possibly in Antwerp. The castle was recorded as roofless but intact from the later 19th century. In the late 1980s it was purchased by a Mr Philips, who began restoration work on the castle.

His main work is Venezuela Heroica (1881), a classic romantic view of history as an epic. Venezuela heroica is structured in five vignettes that depict the main battles and heroes of the Venezuelan War of Independence.

History of Willaston  Willaston is believed to have taken its name from an ancient farmstead known as Wiglaf's tun. Like other English villages, the name has been changed many times over the centuries. This is due to the neighbouring parish of Wistaston having a similar sounding name. To add confusion, Willaston was once ecclesiastically divided between the neighbouring communities of Nantwich and Wybunbury. Whilst there are at least two other villages called Willaston, the earliest documentary evidence relating to Willaston in this part of Cheshire can be found in the Domesday survey of 1086, where is it referred to as Wilavestune, owned by a 'free man' named Ulviet. A few years after the Norman conquest the title passed to Willam Malbank. The manor of Wilvastune remained in the Malbank family for several generations before ownership transferred to the Chanu family in the 13th century. At this time, Willaston was a remote, sparsely populated community with no village centre. Nevertheless, it covered a much larger area than it does today, stretching from Newcastle Road and London Road, Nantwich in the south, along Millstone Lane and as far as the ancient grazing land of Beam Heath in the north. These boundaries did not change until 1936, when local government decided to transfer some of Willaston's land to the expanding communities of Nantwich and Stapeley. In 1553, the manor of Willaston was bought by Richard Sneyd, Recorder of Chester. The Sneyd family lived at Keele Hall in Staffordshire and were the major landowners in WIllaston until the middle of the 19th century. Although Willaston had a number of farmsteads in the Middle Ages, most of the surrounding landscape was uncultivated. However, this began to change as more and more common land began to fall into private ownership during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The process (known as 'enclosure') brought major changes to rural communities such as Willaston, as individual plots of land were fenced off and used for arable farming, meadows and the grazing of livestock. The Sneyd family were absentee landlords but they owned most of the lands in Willaston from 1533 to the late 19th century. Unfortunately, the medieval moated site of the Chanu family was lost during the construction of the Nantwich by-pass in 1989. It was situated to the south-east of the Old Willaston Board School on land now owned by Cheerbrook Farm. Local amenities The village centre of Willaston has two public houses (The Lamb and The Nag's Head) and a social club, while an off-licence provides local produce and day to day goods. Another pub, The Peacock, is situated to the north-west of the village centre, on Crewe Road (the A534). Alongside The Peacock pub is a hotel operated by Premier Inn. The social club offers many social events ranging from a monthly kids disco to various tribute bands and acts. The club has two pool teams, a snooker team, two 7-a-side football teams, a darts and dominoes team and a ladies darts team. In summer 2013 the function room (available for hire) was refurbished. The village also has a fish and chip shop, and hairdressing salons. There are local businesses within the village providing employment (Scanlans, SJB Steel).

A restoration was carried out in September 2019. Former K6 Telephone box converted into a book exchange box Local events The World Worm Charming Championships have been held in Willaston since 1980. One of the major events in Willaston is the World Worm Charming Championships. It was started in 1980 by John Bailey.

The original event in 1980 was won with a total of 511 worms by Tom Shufflebotham - a record that stood until 2009.

The high altar was consecrated in 1185 and in 1187 the presbytery and the transept wings were completed. Due to financial troubles, the works dragged for the whole 13th‚Äì14th centuries. The bell tower was built from 1436 (being completed around the end of the century), while in 1481‚Äì1491 a new sacristy added after the old one had been destroyed by Bartolomeo Colleoni to erect his personal mausoleum, the Colleoni Chapel. In 1521, Pietro Isabello finished the south- western portal, also known as Porta della Fontana. The edifice was restored and modified in the 17th century. Architecture Giovanni da Campione's porch on the left transept. The church opens on the square (Piazza Duomo) on its own left side, as the main fa√ßade has no entrance, being once united to the Bishops' Palace. The external appearance has largely maintained its Lombard Romanesque origins. The church can be accessed by two entrances by Giovanni da Campione (1353) and by Isabello's Porta della Fontana. The main apse is crowned by a loggia surmounted by two frieze with geometrical and vegetables patterns, and has blind arcades with semi-columns. The latter's capitals have also vegetable themes, with the exception of one, decorated by Angels with Last Judgement's Trumpets. The transept's apses have a structure similar to the main one. Notable is Giovanni da Campione's porch in the left transept, which is supported by columns departing from lions in Veronese marble. the arch has a frieze with hunting scenes, while the vault is decorated by polychrome lozenges. A loggia houses statues of St Barbara, St Vincent and St Alexander. At the peak is a Gothic niche by Hans von Fernach (1403), with the Madonna with Child flanked by St Esther and St Grata (1398). also by Giovanni da Campione is the porch of the right transept, with a similar though simpler structure. The columns are supported by lions in white marble. It has reliefs with Christ Crowned by Saints and Birth of the Baptist. Isabello's Renaissance porch has, in the lunette, a fresco of Mary's Nativity attributed to Andrea Previtali. Interior Interior view of dome The interior has maintained the original Romanesque Greek cross plan, with a nave and two aisles divided by piers and ending with an apse, but the decoration its largely from the 17th century Baroque renovation. On the walls are tapestries, partly executed in Florence (1583‚Äì1586) under Alessandro Allori's design, partly of Flemish manufacture, depicting the Life of Mary. Over the tapestry of the Crucifixion (executed in Antwerp on Ludwig van Schoor's cartoons, 1698) is a painting by Luca Giordano, with the Passage of the Red Sea (1691). Left to the entrance is the sepulchre of Cardinal Guglielmo Longhi, work by Ugo da Campione (1313‚Äì1320). On the rear wall are the tomb of the composer Gaetano Donizetti, by Vincenzo Vela (1855) and that of the latter's master Simone Mayr (1852). At the beginning of the left aisle is the Baroque confessional carved by Andrea Fantoni in 1704. A crucifix from the 14th century is on the presbytery's balustrade. In the presbytery itself, housing six bronze candelabra from 1597, is a wooden choir designed by Bernardo Zenale and Andrea Previtali. The reliefs with Biblical tales were executed in 1524‚Äì1555 on designs by Lorenzo Lotto. They are characterized by a polychrome effect rendered through the use of different wood types. The right transepts has Giottesque frescoes from an unknown artist, with Histories of St Aegidius, The Last Supper and the Tree of Life (1347), partially covered by a 17th-century fresco.

He is the most copious and perhaps the most interesting of the Augustan epigrammatists. He lived under the patronage of Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul in BC 15 and then proconsul of Macedonia for several years), who appointed him governor of Thessalonica. There are many allusions in his work to contemporary history: *one celebrates the foundation of Nicopolis by Octavianus, after the battle of Actium *one anticipates his victory over the Parthians in the expedition of 20 BC *one is addressed to Gaius Caesar, who died in AD 4. None can be ascribed securely to a date later than 4. Waterwheel Antipater is also known for being the first to mention use of the waterwheel in a poem. He tells of an advanced overshot wheel watermill around 20 BC/10 AD.; He praised for its use in grinding grain and the reduction of human labour:Lewis, p. vii. The reference is important mentioning the mill, and supports other evidence of the antiquity of use. Taking indirect evidence into account from the work of the Greek technician Apollonius of Perge, the British historian of technology M.J.T. Lewis dates the appearance of the vertical-axle watermill to the early 3rd century BC, and the horizontal-axle watermill to around 240 BC, with Byzantium and Alexandria as the assigned places of invention. A watermill is reported by the Greek geographer Strabon (ca. 64 BC‚ÄìAD 24) to have existed sometime before 71 BC in the palace of the Pontian king Mithradates VI Eupator, but its exact construction cannot be gleaned from the text (XII, 3, 30 C 556). The first clear description of a geared watermill offers the late 1st century BC Roman architect Vitruvius who tells of the sakia gearing system as being applied to a watermill. Vitruvius's account is particularly valuable in that it shows how the watermill came about, namely by the combination of the separate Greek inventions of the toothed gear and the water wheel into one effective mechanical system for harnessing water power. Vitruvius' water wheel is described as being immersed with its lower end in the watercourse so that its paddles could be driven by the velocity of the running water (X, 5.2).

AD 200) was a Greek sophist and rhetorician. He was a son of Zeuxidemus, and a pupil of Adrianus, Pollux, and Zeno. In his orations, both extempore and written, some of which are mentioned by Philostratus, Antipater was not superior to his contemporaries, but in the art of writing letters he is said to have excelled all others, and for this reason the emperor Severus made him his private secretary and tutor (ab epistulis) of his two sons Caracalla and Geta. He was promoted to the consular rank in his early 50s by Septimius Severus, who sent him to govern Bithynia and Pontus. Yet, since Antipater used his sword too freely, he was deprived of his office. As Philostratus reports, Antipater then retired to his native place, where he died at the age of 68 of voluntary starvation. His nomen is derived from the Aelia gens, which would indicate that an ancestor of his had received Roman citizenship while Trajan or Hadrian was emperor (since Aelius was their family name).

It contains two families, the Dasycladaceae and the Polyphysaceae. These single celled algae are from 2 mm to 200 mm long. They live on substrates in shallow warm marine waters, usually less than 20 meters deep. They are very large cells. They are able to attain these sizes without numerous internal cell wells because they build calcium carbonate shells around themselves. They contain only one nucleus in their vegetative stage, which remains in the bottom of the cell in the holdfast at the substrate. Only when they are ready to produce gametes does the nucleus undergo meiosis and then numerous mitoses into many nuclei which then migrate into the gametangia at the top of the alga. Because the nucleus is safely hidden in the holdfast, the cells easily regenerate if the top portions are broken off. These algae are notable for having an intracellular network of 10 nm proteinaceous filaments, possibly for the storage and transport of ribonucleoprotein particles. Because of all these properties, and the fact that they are easy to manipulate they have been favorite organisms in the study of the role of the nucleus vs the unnucleated cytoplasm in the behavior of cells.

Dubtribe consisted of singers Sunshine Jones and Moonbeam Jones, but also included many sit in and on-tour musicians over the years. Born in a rent party, Dubtribe Sound System distinguished itself as performers by performing live for many hours, rather than replaying their recordings from DAT tapes or portable computers, and touring without stopping, often bringing their own sound, lights, and traveling family with them. But unlike its few counterparts in North America, Dubtribe would depart from the warehouse movement and establish itself in the mid-1990s as a grass-roots tour de force, refusing help, press, or money from any outside interests. Origins Sunshine Jones, an ex-punk rocker and Bay Area native, was taking in the still-emerging sounds of hip-hop. At club Townsend, DJ Doc Martin broke out some house music. \\"One night he just started playing Marshall Jefferson and Ten City, and it was a real shock,\\" Sunshine says. \\"I left angry with Martin because he sold out on hip-hop\\". After Sunshine spent a summer on the Spanish party isle of Ibiza in 1989, \\"it started to make sense. All shapes and sizes getting together to dance\\", he says. \\"I wanted to share that. It changed me forever\\". Back in San Francisco, Sunshine had been leading an acid jazz band. When it needed a vocalist, he took on Moonbeam in 1990 (\\"I didn't want to meet anybody named Moonbeam,\\" Sunshine says. \\"I had the shit beaten out of me for my name\\"). Inspired by Ibiza, he tried to transform his group into a live house-music act. Many of the band members bailed, leaving just Sunshine and Moonbeam to go it alone as Dubtribe. At first, it was a grind trying to get booked in a DJ-centric world, but the duo's DIY Come Unity events at the Bryant Street pad (the first event was a rent party) were a hit, and soon Dubtribe was making records. Break-up and reunion Dubtribe Sound System performed what appeared to be its final show at Cielo in New York City on December 1, 2005. The group reunited on September 5, 2009, to play at the Buzz Reunion 101 event at Ibiza Nightclub in Washington, DC. Dubtribe has had several performances across the U.S. from 2010 to 2013. As of 2014, Dubtribe still performs a few times per year.

The song rose up the UK Dance charts, while Dubtribe was struggling to be released from its six-album agreement with Jive parent BMG. After refusing to allow Wrigley's Gum to license the song for a UK television commercial, the band was summarily dropped. *2001's Do it Now', intended as the final Dubtribe Sound System recording, found itself in the hands of the UK Dance Music Guru Simon Dunmore of Defected Records Ltd..

Student activism and university participation frameleft Main speaker at the Z√≥calo (main square in Mexico City) at a student demonstration and rally with more than 200 thousand participants on January 9, 1987 Ordorika majored in physics at the Facultad de Ciencias in the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico in 1991. It is during his student days in the 1980s that he became a militant of the Mexican revolutionary left (izquierda revolucionaria) through the Comit√© Estudiantil de Solidaridad Obrero Campesina (CESOC) and as a member of Revista Punto Critico, a marxist organization and journal founded by the leaders of the 1968 Mexican student movement, and later Convergencia Comunista 7 de enero (CC7). He became an important student leader and representative to UNAM's University Council and gained national prominence with the creation of the Consejo Estudiantil Universitario in 1986. As a student member of the Council first, and with the Consejo Estudiantil, starting on October 31, 1986, Ordorika rejected structural adjustment policies affecting Mexican universities and, more concretely, attempts to increase tuition, restrictive student selection policies and standardized testing, proposed by rector Jorge Carpizo McGregor, at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. Ordorika participated in public debates (di√°logos p√∫blicos) between UNAM administrators and student leaders at the Che Guevara/Justo Sierra auditorium, transmitted live by university radio and featured prominently by the Mexican media in January 1987. During the student strike in February he was one of the selected spokespersons until CEU defeated Carpizo's structural adjustment reforms. National politics In 1988 Ordorika, Santos and Imaz led Mexican university students to support Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' independent presidential candidacy against the ruling Partido Revolucionario Institucional's Carlos Salinas. For this purpose they created the Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) notably featuring Adolfo Gilly, Salvador Mart√≠nez della Rocca, Enrique Gonz√°lez Rojo, Raul Alvarez Garin and others. He was one of the founder and leaders of newly formed left wing party Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Democr√°tica (PRD), led by C√°rdenas. Ordorika was a member of PRD's National Committee from 1990 to 1995. In 1994 he ran as this party's candidate for Federal Congress in Mexico City district XXII. During the 2000 presidential electoral campaign, Ordorika was appointed spokesperson and campaign head of communications for left wing candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. After the elections and the 2001 PRD congress Ordorika abandoned this party and exercised a strong critique against its bureaucratic trends and centrist political positions. Imanol Ordorika is also involved in the Mexican contemporary political debate as a public speaker, an editorial writer at La Jornada and a media commentator. Academic life Ordorika started his studies in physics at Facultad de Ciencias in 1974, but after 15 years he failed and joined CEU. In 1989 he became adjunct professor at the Instituto de Investigaciones Econ√≥micas at UNAM. From 1988 to 1990 he was elected member of the organizing committee for the University Congress at this university. In 1990, he was elected faculty representative to the University Congress. From 2004 to 2008 he was faculty representative to the university senate at UNAM. Ordorika obtained Master in Arts degrees in education (1993) and sociology (1998) as well as a Ph.D degree in social sciences and education from the Stanford Graduate School of Education (1999). He has been a full professor at UNAM since 2002. Ordorika is a faculty member and higher education specialist in Mexico and abroad. He has written extensively on power relations and politics within postsecondary institutions, faculty and student movements, higher education policy and on the impact of globalization on colleges and universities. In 2004 Ordorika received the Frank Talbott Jr. Visiting University Chair from the University of Virginia and in 2006 he was awarded the Alfonso Reyes Chaire des Etudes Mexicaines by the University of Paris III (Sorbonne Nouvelle). He is a member of the Mexican Academy of Sciences and attained the highest level (III) of the National Researchers System (Sistema Nacional de Investigadores). Since 2007 Imanol Ordorika is General Director for Institutional Assessment (Director General de Evaluaci√≥n Institucional) at UNAM. Here has been in charge of the design and development of the Mexican Universities Comparative Study. Publications=Books * Pusser, B., Marginson, S., Kempner, K. y Ordorika, I.

Adrian explains about her quiet and shy philosophy towards Rocky, but is later brought into a relationship with Rocky by her brother, Paulie. Adrian and Rocky later go to an ice rink on Thanksgiving Day, where Rocky told her about his fighting career and his style. She asked him why he wanted to be a boxer, and he said that his father told him that he had no brains, and should develop his body. Adrian is surprised, as her mother said that she didn't have much of a body and should develop her brain.

Then, he taunts her for not being a virgin, which sends Adrian crying, running towards her room, but Rocky stops the tirade, and later offers her to stay at his apartment. Before Rocky's upcoming match against Apollo Creed, Adrian decides to stay in Rocky's locker room. As the rounds go by, she eventually comes out during the 14th. As she witnesses Rocky get knocked down by Apollo, she briefly closes her eyes in silence. At the end of the match, Rocky calls out for her and Adrian rushes toward the ring, losing her hat along the way. As Paulie is denied entrance into the ring by security, she manages to slip inside the ring when he pulls up the ropes. While Creed is announced the winner, she appears to Rocky, to which he asks where her hat was, only for her to express her love for him. Rocky II In the second film, Adrian witnesses Rocky in the hospital after his recent match against Apollo Creed. At first, Apollo goads Rocky into a rematch, but Rocky, instead, intends on retiring from boxing, and undergoes surgery for retinal detachment. After his release from the hospital, Rocky proposes to Adrian at the Philadelphia Zoo, and the couple marry on February 8, 1976. With his earnings, they manage to find a new home and purchase a Pontiac Trans Am. That next month, they discover that they are expecting a baby. After a failed attempt to appear in commercials to capitalize on his newfound fame, Rocky struggles to look for other jobs, eventually prompting him to sell his Pontiac to Paulie. When Rocky announces his intention to come out of his hiatus from boxing to have a rematch with Apollo, Adrian tries to discourage him. Although Mickey encourages him, without Adrian's support he doesn't train well. Worried about money, Adrian returns part-time to the pet store. Due to the amount of lifting with her job and after a heated argument with her brother about her refusal to stand by Rocky's decision, she goes into premature labor, collapsing on the job, and gives birth to a boy. Due to excessive blood loss during labor, she slips into a coma. Rocky becomes distraught, and promises to stay with her until she awakens. In addition to Rocky, she is also visited by Mickey and Paulie. A week later, she regains consciousness. Rocky had refused to see the baby until Adrian came out of the coma. They saw their newborn son for the first time together and at Adrian's suggestion, named him Robert Balboa, Jr. (Robert being Rocky's real first name). Soon after, Adrian tells Rocky to win for her, giving her blessing for him to fight. On the night of the rematch, she stays home along with Paulie to watch the match as she was still recovering. Watching the fight on television, she becomes shocked during the final round as both Rocky and Apollo hit the floor. Both combatants slowly attempt to get back up, but Rocky emerges victorious by just one second, while Apollo stays down, losing the world champion title to Rocky. Adrian and Paulie celebrate and begin to shed tears of joy as Rocky calls out for her in victory. Rocky III The movie begins with showing that Rocky has been very successful and living an opulent lifestyle. Rocky convinces Mickey to move into his mansion so he can look out for him. Rocky, Adrian and Mickey attend the unveiling of a bronze statue in honor of the \\"Italian Stallion\\" at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Overwhelmed by the generosity of the city, Rocky announces his plan to retire from professional boxing. With the crowd booing in disbelief, Clubber Lang, a new up and coming boxer, comes forth and challenges Rocky, harshly berating him for being a coward and a \\"puppet\\". Mickey interrupts Lang's tirade to prevent Rocky from hearing the truth that Mickey hand-picked the ten competitors that Rocky defeated. Then Lang taunts Adrian with overtly sexual remarks; he'll show her a \\"real man\\". causing a goaded Rocky to agree to a match. With his preparation open to the public, Rocky is not able to train seriously for the fight. While his female fans would try to get close to him, Adrian would remain silent, watching in the background. Just minutes before the match, Lang verbally lashes out at Rocky, creating a scuffle, in which Lang shoves Mickey down to the floor, causing him to suffer cardiac arrest. Being escorted back into the locker room, Rocky becomes worried and plans to call the match off, but Mickey tells to him pull himself together, to which Rocky would ask Adrian to stay with him until a doctor comes. Rocky quickly loses the match against Lang, and Mickey dies from a heart attack. Only she, Rocky, Paulie, and Al Savani (his cutman) gather for Mickey's burial. Adrian tags along with Rocky and Paulie as they travel to Los Angeles to train with Apollo Creed for a rematch. Noticing that her husband is not giving his complete focus, Adrian confronts Rocky on the Santa Monica Beach. During the argument, Rocky reveals that he is afraid of losing, but Adrian ensures that they have everything that they have ever dreamed, such as fame and fortune, and that she will always be there for him, regardless of whether he wins or loses. Bolstered by this, Rocky goes on to regain his title from Lang. Rocky IV In the fourth film, Adrian and Rocky are visited by Apollo Creed, who has plans to have an exhibition match against a Russian Soviet Union boxer, Ivan Drago. After hearing his reasons, Adrian tries to discourage Creed, and tells him that she deeply cares about his well-being. Despite her suggestions, an exhibition match between the two materialize. Adrian attends the press conference, sitting with Apollo's wife, Mary Anne. Adrian witnesses the match between Creed and Drago, with Drago beating Creed mightily, causing Creed to die on the spot. Witnessing Apollo's death, she also attends his funeral alongside her husband. Sometime later, Adrian is notified by the press of Rocky announcing his plans to challenge Drago on Christmas in Russia. That night, she and Rocky argue about the risks, Adrian telling him that this is a match that he cannot win. Weeks after Rocky leaves with Paulie and Tony \\"Duke\\" Evers to Russia to train, Adrian surprises him there, and reassures that she will always be with him, no matter what. During the match, Drago overpowers Rocky, making it difficult for her to watch. But, after a moment of seriousness, Rocky delivers a punch that cuts Drago underneath his eye, causing Adrian to shout at Rocky to hit him, thus evening the playing field. After a decisive match, Rocky wins by knockout in the final round. Rocky V In the fifth film, shortly after the match with Drago, Adrian sits with her husband who is showing signs of complications. Upon their return to the United States, they reunite with their son, Robert, and hold a subsequent press conference. With questions about the complications were brought forth, she quickly denies it and states that her husband is in fit condition. But, Rocky is interrupted by fight promoter, George Washington Duke, in hopes of creating another lucrative match. Adrian takes the podium to announce that Rocky is retiring, which stuns the audience. Settling back home, Rocky overhears her and Paulie arguing about a dramatic life-changing situation. Paulie inadvertently has Rocky and Adrian give their accountant a power of attorney. In recoil, the accountant subsequently embezzled and squandered the Balboas' money on real estate deals gone sour, costing the Balboas their entire fortune and virtually all of their assets. In addition, the accountant had failed to pay Rocky's taxes over the past six years, and the mansion has been mortgaged by $400,000. Rocky tells Adrian that he wants to fight again to recoup their assets, but she requests that he should be tested with a physician's approval firsthand. The doctor performs computer- simulated tests, confirming that Rocky is diagnosed with a form of brain damage, and the effects are permanent and irreversible, making it impossible for him to be licensed to box in any state. While Rocky tries to go against his physician's orders, Adrian reassures him that they could make it through, and Rocky reluctantly acknowledges that it's time to retire from boxing. From their lavish lifestyle, they return to the streets, moving into Paulie's old house in South Philadelphia. Returning to her job at the J&M; Tropical Fish pet shop, she and Rocky are cornered by Duke. Rocky would consider offers, but Adrian would deny all of them, as she knows it's a matter of money, and Rocky would be severely disabled if he were to come out of retirement again. She becomes skeptical when Rocky invites a young ruffian boxer from Oklahoma, Tommy \\"the Machine\\" Gunn, to stay with them. With Rocky spending his time training Tommy, it creates a rift between Rocky and Robert. Duke managed to catch Tommy's attention, which causes him to part ways from his mentor. Adrian comes to Rocky's aid, following his dispute with Tommy, leaving Rocky severely frustrated. Rocky saw their relationship as another way of winning, getting back to the life they once lived, but Adrian attests to that, citing that the partnership was actually destroying their family, and should he pass down values, as well as passing it on to his son. From this, Rocky calms down and reconciles with Robert. As Tommy and Rocky engage in a street fight, she is notified by Robert, and the two make their way to the scene. Adrian is last seen walking away with the family in high spirits after Rocky emerged victorious. Rocky Balboa In autumn of 2001, Adrian discovered that she was dying from ovarian cancer. She underwent chemotherapy, but it was not enough to save her life. Adrian died peacefully in her sleep on January 11, 2002, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with her family along her side, aged 51. In the years since, Rocky, trying to break out of his bankruptcy, manages to open a small Italian restaurant, named after her. The walls of the restaurant showcase pictures of Adrian, Italian heritage, as well as Rocky's sports memorabilia, such as ringside photographs, clippings from newspapers, paintings, and his championship belts. Creed Adrian doesn't physically appear in Creed, having previously passed away from ovarian cancer, but photos of her are seen around Rocky's restaurant (which was named after her). When Rocky goes to the graveyard he first goes and puts her brother Paulie's favorite alcoholic drink on his gravestone next to hers, and then reads the newspaper to her and Paulie.

It was established by the Crawford and Ashby land company. A former mining town, Ashford includes all of the communities in the 25009 zip code from the top of Lens Creek Mountain to the bridge crossing Big Coal River, thence up the river (south) toward Costa and down the river (north) to Emmons and Lower White Oak. Rumble was a separate coal camp located within the area known as Ashford, but never had its own post office although there was an elementary school there that burned circa 1960. What was known as Rumble starts near Casey Fork Hollow and continues along County Route 1 to just past the new Ashford-Rumble School. From the Ashford bridge you can travel to Lower White Oak and Emmons (on the Boone County side) and to Dartmont (on the opposite side). Ashford Hill Road follows the east side of Big Coal River and is also considered part of Ashford. Ashford Hill Road ends at Brier Branch. Ashford no longer has a post office. The Ashford post office was destroyed by fire in 2005, and was never reopened. In August 2008, the brand new Ashford bridge opened to the public. The new bridge was named as a memorial to Willis W. Elkins a WWII Navy submarine crewman and long-time educator who was born about 100 yards from where the new bridge stands. The original bridge, constructed in 1923, was demolished on August 26, 2008. One of the locks of the old navigation system was located in Ashford where Lower White Oak Creek enters Big Coal River. This system of locks allowed steamboats to travel up the Big Coal River as far as Peytona. The heyday of the navigation system was in the 1850s. The Civil War interrupted traffic. Soon after the War the system was repaired, but was often rendered unusable due to floods. The coming of the C & O railroad signaled the end of the river transportation system, but remnants of some of the locks can still be seen during low water periods. Schools There is one school in Ashford that is Ashford-Rumble Elementary School. Amy Pritt is the principal of this school.

The series was launched in 1958, shortly after F.C Hall took over Rickenbacker. The guitars were created by Roger Rossmeisl, a German guitar maker.http://www.rickenbacker.com/history_modern.asp Model number and rank The Rickenbacker model numbering system includes many variables such as scale length, number of pickups and deluxe features such as binding and inlay. In addition to the model numbers (310, etc.), a 5 added to the model number signifies the addition of a vibrato, a 10 an additional pickup, and a 1 special features (such as the 331 \\"Light Show\\" guitar with internal multicolored lights and translucent plastic top). There are three main groups in the 300 series: The 310 group instruments (310 to 325) feature a 20-3/4\\" short scale, dot fretboard inlays, and small (12-3/4\\" wide) bodies. The body is unbound, semi-hollow (though lacking a sound hole), and boasts the \\"crescent moon\\"-style cutaways. This series is currently available only in \\"Vintage\\" or \\"C\\" reissue forms. These instruments were originally intended to be student models, but gained prominence due to John Lennon's use of a 325 during the early years of The Beatles. Lennon first heard of Rickenbacker guitars from an early musical hero of his, Jean \\"Toots\\" Thielemans. Lennon was able to obtain his first 325 from a Hamburg, Germany music store in 1959. Although accounts differ as to whether the instrument was part of the shop's regular inventory or if Lennon had it specially ordered, George Harrison maintained in an interview with Guitar Player Magazine that Lennon bought it \\"'on the knocks'‚Äîten percent down, and the rest when they [catch] you!\\" The 330 group consists of full scale guitars with standard features. These models (numbers 330 to 345) feature 24-3/4\\" scale necks, unbound 15\\" wide bodies with Rickenbacker's trademark \\"slash\\" sound hole, and pearl dot fretboard inlays. Finally, the 360 deluxe model group, numbers 360 to 375. These instruments have hollow bodies with rounded top edges and binding on the back edges, stereo \\"Rick-O-Sound\\" output in addition to standard mono output, and large triangular fretboard inlays made from crushed pearl. There are two body styles for these models: the earlier or \\"old style\\" which was produced from its introduction to approximately 1964, and the new style, with rounded top edges. The original style shared the body style of the 330, with sharp edges and cutaways, distinguishable only by the front, back and neck binding and triangle inlays. For examples of the different styles, one could see George Harrison of The Beatles, who used an old style 360/12 (which was actually the second of three prototypes) in the movie and on the album A Hard Day's Night, while Roger McGuinn of The Byrds used a new style 360/12 with a factory-added third pickup and onboard compressor. In addition to the three main groups, there are two other models: The model 350 (now existing only as the reissue models 350V63 and 350/12V63) is a full-scale version of the three-pickup 320 as it would have been produced in 1963 (although the 350 itself was not introduced until much later). This shares all of the same features as the 320, with the exception of scale length. The model 381 is, in reality, a hollow body archtop guitar and is seen as the flagship of the 300 Series in the form of the model 381V69. Its body style is similar to the 330, but with a Gothic carved top and back providing extra depth. The \\"1\\" in the model name signifies pickups, as the 380 was originally intended as an acoustic guitar with electric guitar styling (although the 380 was supplanted by the 381's popularity.) It was most famously used by John Kay of Steppenwolf. Rickenbacker guitars sold in Europe had traditional f-shaped sound holes until the 1980s. This was at the request of European instrument dealers, who were afraid that buyer response to the non-traditional \\"slash\\" sound holes would be poor. An example is the 1996, a (now discontinued) reissue of the export version of the 325.

It closely follows the 1991 novel of the same name by David Cook, who also wrote the screenplay. Plot Graham Holt (William Hurt) is a single man, aged 42, who wants to adopt a ten-year-old son. Graham is a sub- postmaster in a village in Wales. James Lennards (Chris Cleary Miles) is a disturbed child brought up in foster care. Graham wants a son, but James doesn't want another father at the time. Graham walks by an agency and starts looking at pictures of children. Being a single man and unmarried he decided maybe adoption is the way to go. He spots James picture and when he sits filling out the forms he is slightly baffled as to why he wrote son. Later in the film he makes a comment to James as to how desperate they must be to be considering himself to be a parent, 'since you can count on one hand the number of single men who wish to adopt.' Graham Holt's emotional development has been smothered by his uncaring parents. Graham was born to parents who loved each other more than their son, never spending time with him and later on pretending to be interested in him. His mother passes on and a year later his father suffers a stroke which means Graham has to now care for him. Later in a heartfelt scene, Graham's father passes and James bring out a shell placing it on Graham's ear, the one good memory Graham ever had of his father. This takes place later on in the film. James has been shifted from foster home to group home throughout his short life. Causing some disruptions and being unable to relate to women. Due to the nature of his past he has a hard time coping, anger, self-mutilation are just a few things that Happens with young James. He only has a vague memory of his mother when he was aged 3, but has a vivid and romantic image of his father. James's father is in and out of prison and has spun tales of him being a 'mercenary' in the one time they have spent together on the run. Near the end of the film, James finally dreams and remembers what has happened to his mother. As Graham goes through the extended vetting process to be an adoptive parent, He then has to attend classes and meet regularly with social workers. Graham and James meet and the embarrassed silences demonstrate Graham's nervousness and James's fears of the situation. Graham is not sure how to behave, nor what to say, due to being nervous. He talks about wanting a son, and suggests what James needs, ungracefully saying that James need a father, but stammering on the what James needs is that special someone to look after his needs. Throughout the movie James has flashbacks of his past about his father and his mother. They cause him to act out, from self-mutilation to destruction of property. Asked by James Key worker, if Graham likes children his reply is ‚ÄòYes, but I don't think I could eat a whole one.' Trying to make a tense situation easier. The Key Worker is cut off from explaining issues about James when James enters the room. When James is shown the room that would be his if the adoption goes through, it also serves as James room when he starts his visits to Graham's place. He moves towards Graham and places his arms around Graham's waist. He then hugs him briefly. Showing affection for the first time in his young life. James also makes friends in this time with some of the local children racing with a bicycle. On one trip out in the car, Graham tries to explain how a relationship should work, He explains it should be a partnership, he never mentions love. Graham has to visit key people in James' past; one of them, Lynn, a foster mother, who was one of the few females James ever got along with, was disappointed that James would not stop in to see her. She explained to Graham about James constantly running away and finding him partially dressed, always hiding in holes and covered in dirt. During this time a flashback scene is shown of James hiding from the police. On the ride home Graham asked James why he liked Lynn when women don't seem to be his cup of tea. James due to having issues starts to self-harm himself, first by scratching his legs with his hand, then by trying to jump from the car, all the while telling Graham that Lynn is not a proper woman, eventually forcing Graham to stop the car as James tries to jump out. James convinces Graham that tenting is fun. James stands in the small shop choosing gear while Graham remains outside with his caseworker. She quickly tells Graham to beware of knots for once they are tied they are harder to get out from. It's a happy experience. James plays in a creek while teaching an inept Graham the ways of camping or as the English refer to it as tenting. James tests Graham as well by finding a stick and giving himself and injury on his forehead. He tells Graham while remembering an experience by his birth father, that the kiss has to be a long one to make it feel better. After Graham asks Jamie if he was testing Graham and James replies, 'I often test people.' Unfortunately this is fairly common in the world scope of foster care since nothing is ever permanent. Later that night on the camp out Jamie goes to relieve himself then returns to the tent cold, and slips into the sleeping bag with Graham. Who at the time is dreaming and does not even realize the boy is in with him until he wakes in the morning. After a few weekends together, Graham takes James to meet Graham's father's brother, Uncle Turpin (John Hurt). Turpin teases James and finally makes him smile. He asks Graham if he has ever apologized to his father; he always hated Graham's mother, since she would never let the father have a moments peace. Graham replied it was a true love to which Turpin replies ‚Äòno' since she would not even let Graham's father take a whittle on his own. Turpin also asks Graham if he is sure about wanting to adopt, Graham is adamant about it that this is what he wants to do. So James now has a better understanding of Graham, and Graham a better understanding of James. While their relationship develops and has its ups and downs, nothing shakes Graham's belief that he is the one person who can make all the difference and that between them, they could change each other. Near the end James's father unexpectedly shows up and asks Graham to allow him to stay nearby secretly for the last few months he is expected to live, just to be able to see James without James knowing he is there. Graham decides that James should meet his father, that James should know that his father is dying of AIDS so that James would not have to wonder years later as to what had happened to his father. As a new school season is starting Graham is allowed to foster James while the final adoption can take place. In this way James would not have to change schools during the process. The reunion with James's father does not go well and James withdraws into himself. Once again the pains of the past take over as James tries to escape the pain in the only way he knows how. Graham invites James' father to move in with them, and he and James care for him as he lives his last few months. In the end Graham says to Jamie, \\"I won't be second best.\\" As James flips a sign over at a gas station from open to closed, more a symbol of his past is over and his new life is beginning, as he hurries to catch Graham and places his hand in Graham's.

In central and eastern Algeria it is called qe≈°≈°aba or qe≈°≈°abiya. The mountain dwellers of Morocco call it tadjellabit, which is a Berberized form. Etymology Reinhart Dozy's theory that the Djellaba would have been, originally, the \\"garment of the Djellab\\", that is to say of the slave trader, has been rejected by William Mar√ßais who proposed to see in djellaba an alteration of djilbab which, in ancient Arabic, meant draped clothing, although the djellaba is sewn rather than draped. He pointed out that in Oman the form gillab designates the woman's veil. The disappearance of the first b would have occurred identically in the Maghreb and Oman. As for the qe≈°≈°abiya, Georges S√©raphin Colin sees in this name the deformation of the Latin gausapa, a term which would have been preserved in the gosaba form in the Adrar where it designates the shirt. Overview Traditionally, djellabas are made of wool in different shapes and colours, but lightweight cotton djellabas have now become popular. Among the Berbers, or Imazighen, such as the Imilchil in the Atlas Mountains, the colour of a djellaba traditionally indicates the marital status (single or married) of the bearer:ezinearticles.com/?Traditional-Hand-Dressmaking-in- Marrakech&id;=3360786 a dark brown djellaba indicating bachelorhood. Traditionally, djellabas reached down to the ground but lightweight djellabas are somewhat slimmer and shorter. Men often wear a light-coloured djellaba sometimes along with a traditional Arab red fez hat and soft yellow babouche slippers (balgha in Arabic) for religious celebrations and weddings. Almost all djellabas of both styles (male or female) include a baggy hood called a qob (Arabic: ŸÇÿ®) that comes to a point at the back. The hood is important for both sexes, as it protects the wearer from the sun, and in earlier times, it was used as a defence against sand being blown into the wearer's face by strong desert winds. In colder climes, as in the mountains of Morocco, it also serves the same function as a winter hat, preventing heat loss through the head and protecting the face from snow and rain. It is common for the roomy hood to be used as a pocket during times of warm weather; it can fit loaves of bread or bags of groceries. Traditional djellabas are generally made of two types of material, cotton for summer wear and coarse wool for the winter. The wool is typically obtained from sheep in the surrounding mountains. Buttons for djellabas are made in the town of Bhalil.

Germanic culture is characterized as having significant roots from Scandinavian and Teutonic cultures, and has notable influences from other societies at the time, namely the Roman Empire,Brogan, O., 1936. Trade between the Roman Empire and the free Germans. The Journal of Roman Studies, 26(2), pp. 195‚Äì222. who gave the tribe its Latin name, Germani.Gummere, F.B., 1892.

The Germanic Languages. Cambridge University Press. pp. 1‚Äì20 and 550 million speakers worldwide. Origins There is much debate over the exact period that Germanic culture became a distinct cultural group within Europe. With the first recorded annotations written by Tacitus, the Roman historianBeare, W., 1964. Tacitus on the Germans. Greece & Rome, 11(1), pp. 64‚Äì76. most agree that the culture‚Äôs roots were present from about 1‚Äì400 AD onward.Hedeager, L., 1988. The evolution of Germanic society 1-400 AD. RAF Jones et al, 85. The ancestors of the medieval Germanic peoples are believed to be genealogical descendants of the Nordic Bronze Age, an event that saw mass emigration from the colder regions of the north into the fertile lands of central Europe.Anfinset, N. and Wrigglesworth, M., 2014. Local Societies in Bronze Age Northern Europe. Routledge. For this reason, Germanic mythology and that of the Norse pantheon having a striking resemblance resulting in several identical myths and legends.Owen, Francis (1960). The Germanic People. New York: Bookman Associates Language The first emergence of a linguistically distinct Germanic language is thought to be around 500 B.C., however since the only written records of the time are from Tacitus, it is difficult to establish a clear progression of the language‚Äôs trajectory. While there is no written evidence to suggest that most tribes were able to converse with each other, it is likely that they were multilingual as almost every one of the dialects has its roots within the mother (PIE) language. Until around the 5th Century AD, most dialects were diverse enough in their structure, syntax and content that any attempts at reconciling the two could not be done. By then, Germanic languages had picked up extensive amounts of Latin from their exposure to the Roman empire.Wolfram, H., 1997. The Roman empire and its germanic peoples. Univ of California Press. This signalled the transition to the varied modern Germanic languages prevalent today, with features such as its differing characters, (the umlaut) its declarative sentence structure (subject, verb, other) and its emphasis on \\"strong\\" and \\"weak\\" verbs, that make it functionally different from many other languages that are comparable around Europe.Meillet, A. and Dismukes, W.P., 1970. General characteristics of the Germanic languages. Coral Gables, FL: University of Miami Press. Religion and folklore Paganism has always been the driving religious system practised within Germanic tribes. However, each tribe or group would belong to a different sect, one formed through interaction with other societies and religions, and loosely based on a Nordic/European tradition.Jones, P. and Pennick, N., 2013. A history of pagan Europe. Routledge.pp. 2‚Äì3 One of the largest influences upon Germanic religion has been its encounters with other cultural groups such as the Celts and Romans, who also inhabited central Europe. There is archaeological evidence to suggest that these religions / customs traded iconography and myth freely amongst themselves.Ewing, Thor (2010). Gods and Worshippers in the Viking and Germanic World. pp.1‚Äì18 The afterlife within their religion was similar to the Norse, as an emphasis on dying a glorious death in battle was seen as a sacrifice given to the gods to please them. For example, deities worshipped by Germanic cultures (such as Odin, or Thor) share direct lineage with the Norse gods of the same name. While worship of these gods has waxed and waned over the years, there is proof that they did stem from a northern European origin. Germanic religion also had many crossovers with that of the Romans. Notably their shared ritual practices, particularly the culture‚Äôs fascination with nature and their position within the world: primarily with a patriarchal worldview concerning men‚Äôs position within the religion: having men as the executors of rituals, akin to a family priest or shaman. These rituals did not occur in any ceremonial buildings, instead taking place within the home, a place of much spiritual importance to Germanic culture. While spiritual duties were traditionally carried out by men, there are historical examples of Germanic priestesses in Roman writings, women who would take the role of a religious leader and would usually be involved in the performance of executions. Their folklore has always been one that has directly reflected their physical environments: Gnomes, who lived underground: Woodland Elves who inhabited the forests, and basilisks, living in the seas.Lecouteux, C., 2016. Encyclopedia of Norse and Germanic folklore, mythology, and magic. Simon and Schuster. Elements of these traditions have endured into the modern day, and are still told as contemporary fairy tales.MacGregor, Neil (28 September 2014). \\"The country with one people and 1,200 sausages\\". BBC. The transition to Christianity only began when contact with Rome reached a zenith in the 11th century and Scandinavian paganism was successfully replaced by the Christian church. Religion in modern Germanic culture is directly split between Catholicism and the EKD, a German evangelical church.

He had lived in Paris, but would often return to Oloron-Sainte-Marie, where his mother lived. There, he would recuperate through writing poetry. Career as a politician After being mobilized in World War I, he became Secretary of the Deputy to Achille Armand Fould, which he continued until joining the Ministry for Agriculture (1930‚Äì1932). As he began his career in political office, he became friends with Louis Barthou, Deputy of Oloron-Sainte-Marie, President of the Council and several times Minister for the Third Republic. During the beginning of his political career, he actively corresponded with Francis Jammes who he had met in B√©arn. Career as a writer In 1906, Huc forged binding friendships with both Francis Carco and Robert de la Vaissi√®re: They would later come together to create l‚ÄôEcole Fantaisiste (The Fantasy School). Then, in 1908, he became an editor for two magazines--H√©lios and l'Oliphant. At that time, he adopted his pseudonym, Tristan Der√®me. In the years leading up to World War I, The Fantasy School attracted talented individuals like Paul-Jean Toulet, Jean-Marc Bernard, Jean Pellerin, Francis Carco, Leon V√©rane, Robert de la Vaissi√®re, Rene Bizet, and No√´l Ruet. In 1922, he was nominated for membership in La Pl√©iade, along with Charles Maurras, Anna de Noailles, and Paul Val√©ry. A year later, he would meet B√©atrix Dassane, the Clym√®ne of his poems.

One of the biggest criticisms it faces is the perceived threat it poses to small private owned businesses due to the monopoly it imposes over products. Other controversial areas concern the treatment of staff, trading deals with suppliers and customer relations, as well as their approach to foreign businesses. There is also a belief that they use aggressive tactics to gain land and/or planning permission for building new stores. Allegations against the company are varied, including: *Chicken welfare controversy *Discrimination against Asian customers *Dishonest corporate policy *Eco-towns and the environment *Faking price cuts *Bullying suppliers and farmers *Local opposition to new stores and corporate expatiation *Financial affairs *Health and safety issues *Child labour accusations and other overseas cases The Tesco supermarket chain is often involved in litigation, usually from claims of personal injury from customers, claims of unfair dismissal from staff, and other commercial matters such as the treatment of suppliers. The public perception of the company as behaving unethically has led to the formation of pressure groups such as \\"No Tesco in Stokes Croft\\", minor consumer product boycotts and several lawsuits. Criticism of Tesco and related litigation As with any large corporation, the Tesco supermarket chain is involved in litigation, usually from claims of personal injury from customers, claims of unfair dismissal from staff, and other commercial matters. Two notable cases were Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd, which set a precedent in so-called 'trip and slip' injury claims against retailers, and Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass, which reached the House of Lords and became a leading case regarding the corporate liability of businesses for failures of their store managers (in a case of misleading advertising). Criticism of Tesco includes disapproval of the effects supermarket chains can have on farmers, suppliers and smaller competitors; along with claims of generally poor labour relations with its staff concerning sick leave regulations. Accusations concerning using cheap and/or child labour in Bangladesh amongst other places, have also arisen since the millennium. Tesco has been heavily criticised by the media in both the UK and Ireland among other places over its perceived ruthless and harsh business tactics compared to its rivals, all of whom stand charged, like Tesco, of bullying farmers to lower their prices to unsustainable levels. Waitrose was the only major supermarket to come out of this accusation relatively unscathed. Other less prominent disputes have occurred in Thailand, Ireland and Hungary. Tesco has been subject to several claims of apparently out-of-date food being 'back- labelled' to appear to still be in date, poor caf√© hygiene and a staff member contracting legionnaires' disease in the Wrexham store. Accusations concerning the use of cheap and/or child labour in Bangladesh amongst other places, have also arisen since 2000. Cases in the UK=Corporate policyThe UK's Competition Commission monopoly inquiry= In 2006, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) referred the UK grocery market to the Competition Commission for a new inquiry. In January 2007, the Competition Commission, published its initial findings into the UK grocery market. It said that they were \\"concerned with whether Tesco or any other supermarket can get into such a strong position, either nationally or locally, that no other retailer can compete effectively\\". It, however, found no actual basis for accusations that Tesco could use its land bank to control nearly half of national grocery retailing, and that suppliers' profits were being squeezed by the supermarket. Tesco's 2004 Adminstore acquisition led to local and UK-wide protests. Tesco's other store openings and expansions are sometimes contested by campaign groups. When a company controls more than 25% of a business sector in the UK, it is usually blocked from buying other companies in that sector (but not from increasing its market share through organic growth). The Office of Fair Trading currently treats supermarkets and convenience stores as two distinct sectors‚Äîalthough this definition has been challenged by smaller retailers, including the Association of Convenience Stores. =Planning infringements and corporate \\"land bank\\" conspiracy theory= In February 2006, a group of UK MPs produced a report highlighting the near monopoly powers of the big four supermarkets. One problem discussed by the group was that of building without appropriate planning permission. The discussion stemmed from the company's building of a store in Stockport that was 20% larger than the company actually had permission to build. In September 2006, subsequent (retrospective) planning permission was requested by Tesco but refused. Substandard cement was used in the railway tunnel under their new Gerrards Cross store. Tesco Stores Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment [1995] 1 W.L.R. 759; [1995] 2 All E.R. 636, deals with the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, where Tesco wanted to build a superstore outside Oxford. Criticism of Tesco includes allegations of stifling competition due to its undeveloped \\"land bank\\", pugilistically aggressive new store development without real consideration of the wishes, needs and consequences to local communities, using cheap and/or child labour, opposition to its move into the convenience sector and breaching planning laws. =Tesco v Walmart= Clubcard holders receive statements offering discount coupons which can be spent in-store, online or on various Tesco deals. Tesco was cited in a Wall Street Journal article(Abstract only is online) as using the intelligence from the Clubcard to thwart Wal-Mart's initiatives in the UK. =Pricing and advertising= The group has been criticised for its tactics, including allegedly misleading consumers with \\"phoney\\" price cuts. For example, advertising huge savings, when in fact they are only lowering the price of less popular items and raising the price of more popular goods. The Grocer also named ASDA as the cheapest UK supermarket (based on 33 items). Tesco was second and Sainsbury's and Morrisons joint third. Tesco price check tends to differ saying out of 7134 (compared to ASDA) products, (Survey carried out between 9 July 2007 and 11 July 2007) Tesco is cheaper: 1835 (compared to 1251 the previous week), Tesco is more expensive: 975 (compared to 984 the previous week) and Tesco is the same price: 4324 (compared to 4996 the previous week). Kayser Bondor v Tesco Stores (Times, 25 January 1962) Tesco's first reported case, it won an injunction against a retailer who it sold goods. Tesco required that the prices sold would not be lower than a certain minimum (resale price maintenance). Granting the injunction, Cross J held that no matter how much Kayser disliked the terms, it was not compelled to enter the contract. If it did it would have to abide by the terms, unless it could convince Parliament to legislate against the practice (see now, Competition Act 1998) In 2011, Tesco was fined ¬£300,000 for misleading customers regarding the sale of strawberries. Trading Standards in Birmingham brought the case stating that ¬£1.99 strawberries on sale in Sheldon, Birmingham, had not been for sale at ¬£3.99 long enough. Tesco admitted misleading customers into believing that the strawberries on sale were genuinely \\"half price\\". =Trading relations with suppliers= Tesco is also censured by those who think that it infringes upon the interests of farmers and smaller suppliers. The company responds by claiming that it follows industry-best practice and sources locally where it can to meet customer demand. In March 2005, the Office of Fair Trading published an audit of the workings of its code of practice on relationships between supermarkets and their suppliers. It reported that no official complaints had been received against Tesco or any of the other major supermarkets, but the supermarkets' critics, including Friends of the Earth, contested that suppliers were prevented from complaining by fear of losing business, and called for more rigorous supervision of the supermarkets. A further report by the Office of Fair Trading in August 2005 concluded that the aims of the Code of Practice were being met. In September 2006, Tesco came to an agreement with Tyrrells Crisps to stop selling grey market supplies. Tyrrells was founded by potato farmer Will Chase after big supermarkets' purchasing-power almost put his farm out of business. He started Tyrrells to gain greater margin by selling directly, and only sold through delicatessens and Waitrose supermarket. After Tesco bought supplies from the grey market, Chase sought legal advice but Tesco backed down. Tesco has been subject to several claims of apparently out- of-date food being 'back-labelled' to appear still to be within date, poor caf√© hygiene and a staff member contracting legionnaires' disease in the Wrexham store. Tesco denied squeezing its suppliers in December 2013 after retail analyst Cantor Fitzgerald accused Tesco of practices that risked breaching the Groceries Supply Code of Practice and criticised its trading relationships. Similar accusations were also made in April 2005 despite its record ¬£2,000,000,000 profit. =Labour relations= In May 2004, Tesco announced it was reducing sick pay in an attempt to reduce levels of unplanned absence, which led to concerns over employees continuing to work despite poor health (faced with a reduced income otherwise). American union leaders, representing employees of Tesco's Fresh & Easy brand, have complained that a \\"stark contrast\\" exists between the way the supermarket chain treats their British workers and staff at their US business. Tesco Stores Ltd v Othman- Khalid (Unreported, 10 September 2001), Mr Othman-Khalid was dismissed from a Tesco petrol station. CCTV cameras had shown him serving himself, playing video games on shift and taking a pack of ten cigarettes that was damaged stock and meant to be returned to the manufacturer. At a disciplinary, he lied saying that he had sold the cigarettes to a customer. He claimed that the dismissal was unfair (see unfair dismissal), and the tribunal agreed, because it said too much weight was given to the theft of the cigarettes over other factors of his job performance. The tribunal allowed the claim, but reduced his damages by 10% for contributory fault. But on appeal, Underhill QC found for Tesco that dismissal for theft, however small, was within the \\"reasonable range of responses\\" of an employer, under s.98(4) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. Amanda Hardy v Tesco Stores Plc [2006] EWHC 3091, Judge Seymour QC dismissed a claim by Mrs Hardy that she got a back injury while trying to lift some heavy bottles from the conveyor belt at the checkout. It was found her evidence was unreliable. Tesco Stores Ltd v Wilson (No.2) (aka, Abrahams v Wilson) (Unreported, 12 January 2000), Mr Wilson was an Afro-Caribbean rastafarian who worked for Barkland Cleaning Ltd, as a cleaner contracted to Tesco's site in Mereway, Northampton. Mr. Abrahams, one of the Tesco security guards, was on duty in plain clothes. When Mr Wilson drove into the car park, Mr. Abrahams knocked on his window and told him to get out so he could search the car. When Mr. Wilson refused, he said \\"you lot think you can get away with anything\\" and went and filed a report. Then Mr. Wilson was dismissed. He claimed this was unfair, because it was discrimination under the Race Relations Act 1976. He won ¬£5,000 in damages. Tesco appealed, but lost again. Judge Peter Clark held that \\"you lot\\" was certainly intended to refer to race, and that the whole defence of Tesco was meant to depict Mr. Wilson as violent and dishonest. This justified an aggravated damages award. Tesco Group of Companies (Holdings) v Hill [1977] I.R.L.R., a 63-year-old checkout operator did not ring up 18 items worth ¬£7 in one customer's purchase. Tesco started an investigation. She said she felt ill. Tesco called the police. They dismissed her. The Employment Appeal Tribunal held that the dismissal was unfair because she was given no opportunity to state her case when she was in a fit state. Johnson v Tesco Stores [1976] I.R.L.R. 103, an old case under old law, the employment tribunal found Tesco to have unfairly dismissed Mr Johnson. He had wrongly stated on his application that he had a certain job between 1967‚Äì73, when he had not. Eighteen months later Tesco found out, and they said this was the reason for dismissal. Under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1974 Sch.1, para.6, which refers to conduct during and not prior to employment, conduct prior to the start of the contract could not make the contract itself void. So Tesco was found to have dismissed Mr Johnson unfairly. During 2007, a group of Tesco employees were investigated for criticising the firm's human resources policy and its \\"rude\\" customers on the Facebook social networking site. =Customer privacy laws= In January 2005, Tesco faced criticism for their testing of RFID tags used to collect information on product movement in pilot stores. Critics label the tags \\"Spy Chips\\" and allege that they are to be used to collect information on customers' shopping habits. Local opposition to new stores and corporate expatiation Tesco's expansion has not been without criticism and, in some cases, active opposition. In April 2011, longstanding opposition to a Tesco Express store in Cheltenham Road, Stokes Croft, Bristol, evolved into a violent clash between opponents and police. The recently opened storefront was heavily damaged and the police reported the seizure of petrol bombs. Opponents such as No Tesco in Stokes Croft, have suggested that the store would damage small shops and harm the character of the area. Financial affairsTaxation laws= Tesco are currently suing The Guardian for libel and malicious falsehood over The Guardians claims that Tesco has developed a complex taxation structure involving offshore bank accounts in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. The Guardian claimed that this arrangement would enable Tesco to avoid an estimated ¬£1 billion tax on profits from the property sales, and also to avoid paying any tax on continuing operation of the stores, as the rate of corporation tax in the Cayman Islands is zero. On 5 April 2008 it was reported that Tesco was suing The Guardian for libel and malicious falsehood over the newspaper's claims that Tesco has developed a complex taxation structure involving offshore bank accounts in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. =Alleged bribery= Tesco Stores Ltd v Pook [2003] EWHC 823; [2004] I.R.L.R. 618, Mr Pook was a senior employee who got a computer company called Delta to pay his own company a \\"consultancy fee\\" (i.e. a bribe) to make sure Delta did not lose a supply contract with Tesco. Mr Pook was already serving 3 years jail for theft, and this action was for Tesco to get back that bribe money. It succeeded, because it was held that Mr Pook was in breach of trust through his conflict of interest. Moreover, there was an implied term that Mr Pook would not be allowed to exercise his rights under the company ESOP, until he had paid all he owed. Tesco Plc v Customs and Excise Commissioners [2003] EWCA Civ 1367, the Court of Appeal dismissed the claim by Tesco that it did not have to pay any VAT for transactions done under its loyalty card scheme. =SFO investigation into relations with the auditor PwC= In August, Tesco's financial management had announced that the firm's half-year dividend would be cut by 75% and full-year profits would be in the region of ¬£2.4bn to ¬£2.5bn, less than its previous revenue estimate of ¬£2.8bn, and already ¬£0.5bn down on last year's ¬£3.3bn reported corporate profits. The Serious Fraud Office launched a formal criminal probe into the auditing and accounting practices in mid 2014 and the Financial Reporting Council in December 2014. The US brokers JP Morgan claimed that the fiscal 'hole' in Tesco's accounts could be even worse than expected. The FRC decided to investigate auditor PwC for allegedly maliciously messing about with Tesco's accounts. on 22 December 2014. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) launched a criminal investigation into alleged accounting irregularities. Tesco said it had been \\"co-operating fully\\" with the SFO, who took matter out of the hands of the Financial Conduct Authority, the City's business regulator. The UK accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, was also reported to be monitoring Tesco. Tesco's auditor PwC declined to comment. It found that they were overstated by ¬£118m in the first half of this year, by ¬£70m in the 2013-2014 financial year and by ¬£75m before that. Warwick Business School's Prof Crawford Spence said: \\"Now that Tesco are being investigated for fraud by the SFO, the Financial Reporting Council have yet greater reason to start an investigation into the auditors' role with regard to these irregularities\\". The accountancy firm Deloitte had launched investigation into Tesco's misreported profits a week earlier. Tesco had suspended eight executives pending further enquiries by 18 October 2013, including the UK corporate boss Chris Bush, while an investigation into the scandal takes place. The firm is also withholding payments worth ¬£2,000,000 to its former chief executive Philip Clarke and chief financial officer Laurie McIlwee. Service levelsHome delivery services= In 2007, Tesco failed to deliver groceries via online shopping to a university campus in Sussex, offering no refund or apology. This sparked a local backlash from many customers who had similar dissatisfying experiences with Tesco's online delivery service.The Argus Newspaper, 25 May, page 27. In July 2015, Tesco announced that the minimum order from 23 July 2015 would be ¬£40 unless a ¬£4 surcharge was paid. This would be applied to all customers including those who had paid in advance for Delivery Savers promising \\"Once a day deliveries (over ¬£25) for every day included in your plan\\" for up to twelve months. =Queuing times= In December 2006, The Grocer magazine published a study which named Tesco as having the slowest checkouts of the six major supermarkets. Somerfield had the shortest queues with an average wait of 4 min 23 seconds. In order of least time spent at the checkout, the other major supermarkets were Waitrose, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons. =Facebook and Tesco= During 2007, a group of Tesco employees were investigated for criticising the firm's human resources policy and its 'rude' customers on the Facebook social networking site. =Clubcard= June 2016 saw the last clubcard boost event where customers could double up points to use in- store.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/25/tesco-customers-gutted-as- supermarket-scraps-popular-double-club/ In January 2018, Tesco announced that all clubcard points offers where points could be doubled or quadrupled would end. No notice was given to customers and Tesco faced a huge backlash. It then delayed the change to June 2018.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/17/tesco-delays-clubcard- changes-customer-backlash-reward-loyalty-scheme Product quality issuesFebruary 2013 horse meat scandal= In 2013, as part of the 2013 meat adulteration scandal DNA tests revealed that horse meat was present in some meat products sold in Findus and ABP Food Group ready packed meals. On 7 February 2013, it was revealed by the Food Standards Agency that the Findus beef lasagne range in the UK, France and Sweden and the shepherd's pie and moussaka ranges in France contained horse meat without proper declaration or official scrutiny. 2013-02-10 lemonde.fr2013-02-10 thelocal.se The contamination may have gone on since summer 2012 according to a leaked document. 2013-02-09 independent.co.uk Ready packed meal firm Findus, Compass Group was the world's biggest catering firm at the time, and Whitbread, which was Britain's biggest hotel group, were indicted for illegally selling concealed horse meat in food products. Compass Group had sold it to 47 Lancashire schools and a \\"small number\\" of schools in northern Ireland. As a result, Tesco dropped in market value by Wednesday 16 January 2013. Tesco, the Co-operative Group and Aldi also decided to cancel contracts with ABP Food Group because of the adulteration. In a public letter later that day, 11 firms, including Tesco and Asda, said they shared shoppers' \\"anger and outrage\\". Whitbread vowed to remedy the unacceptable situation on 26 February . The Food Standards Agency's (FSA) chief executive, Catherine Brown also said \\"it is unlikely we will ever know\\" how many unwittingly ate horse meat. =Food hygiene allegations= On 22 May 2007 the BBC's Whistleblower programme showed undercover footage detailing breaches of food hygiene rules in a branch of Tesco. The Whistleblower reporter applied for a job following a tip-off from a former employee. Breaches included the sale of products after their sell-by date; allegations that the company illegally and sold 'back- labelled' products after their use by date; falsification of temperature records; and the sale of partially cooked mince mixed with uncooked mince. A staff member also contracted legionnaires' disease in the Wrexham store. In addition to this the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, has on a number of occasions ordered the recall of Tesco branded products, including a case of glass contamination. Environmental Health Officers served a closure order on Tesco's store in Prussia Street, Dublin, the day after they inspected it, for a number of breaches of Food Hygiene Regulations. Tesco has been subject to several claims of apparently out-of-date food being 'back-labelled' to appear still to be within date, poor caf√© hygiene and a staff member contracting legionnaires' disease in the Wrexham store. Alleged health and safety issuesTesco's Kick drink= On 16 April 2007, BBC Northern Ireland's current affairs programme Newsline reported that the head of Newtownbreda High School in Belfast wanted its local Tesco store to stop selling the Kick energy drink, which was, like other brands, thought to be responsible for caffeine- induced misbehaviour in the classroom. The school had gone so far as to ban children from bringing the drink on to its grounds. In other schools it was also connected with caffeine addiction problems and insomnia in young male pupils. A school in Worthing, Sussex banned both Kick and Red Bull over the same problem. Tesco rejected the school's claims saying \\"... a normal serving contains no more caffeine than a cup of coffee. There is currently no legislation which would allow us or any other retailer to ban the sale of this or any other energy drink to children.\\" =Alcohol= Tesco's Dorset stores have been particularly censored for selling excessively discounted alcohol products as a loss leader. =Personal injury claims= Tesco Stores Ltd v Pollard [2006] EWCA Civ 393, a 13-month-old child fell ill when it ate some washing powder from a product that had a faulty child resistant cap. It was bought from Tesco, but manufactured by another company. When bringing proceedings against Tesco and the manufacturer, Tesco joined the mother for negligence in not properly looking after the child. The Court of Appeal found Tesco and the manufacturer alone liable under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. W (A Child) v Tesco Stores Ltd [2005] C.L.Y. 3097, in the St Albans County Court, a 10-year-old girl won ¬£1600 worth of damages for an injury to her ear five years before. She had slipped in the supermarket. Tesco Stores Ltd v Harrow LBC [2003] EWHC 2919, in the Harrow store, a customer found a piece of wire in a bap. The local council was found to be entitled to fine Tesco under the Food Safety Act 1990 (section s.8.). Collins v Tesco Stores Ltd [2003] EWCA Civ 1308, the Court of Appeal (Pill LJ giving the lead judgment) agreed that Mrs Jan Collins' claim for some ¬£24,000 for a workplace injury was statute barred. Because she had not brought the claim within 3 years of knowing the injury to be significant she was too late. Sutton v Tesco Stores Plc (Unreported, 30 July 2002) Mrs Sutton, who was a nurse and was pregnant, slipped on a squashed tomato at the store. She won ¬£7500 in general damages for her anxiety about the baby (who was born prematurely) and painful injury to her wrist. Harvey v Tesco Plc [2002] 6 Q.R. 11, Mrs Harvey at age 73 slipped on the floor in Tesco and fell, injuring her hand. She had to have a plaster cast, and because of swelling her wedding ring needed to be cut off. She received ¬£4000 in damages. K (A Child) v Tesco Stores Ltd [2000] C.L.Y. 1670, in the Uxbridge Crown Court a seven-year-old won ¬£500 damages for minor injuries at the Tesco store. An automatic door had failed to open and the child got bruising for a week, and felt quite ill the next day with a 'bad bump to the head'. Jacob v Tesco Stores Plc (Unreported, 19 November 1998), the Court of Appeal (Henry LJ and Clarke J) held that Mrs Jacob, a Tesco employee, was entitled to damages after a heavy fall probably from a water puddle in the store. Mrs Jacob had hurried to answer a colleague's query, and stepped in a water puddle. She quickly told someone that they should get a cleaner, hurried on 25 paces and fell. Tesco argued that the judge had not applied the leading case, Ward v Tesco Stores Ltd [1976] 1 W.L.R. 810 properly, which uses the res ipsa loquitur doctrine (i.e. if it were not for the puddle, how else could it have happened?). Tesco argued that there was no way the puddle could have made her slip 25 paces later, but their argument was dismissed because they could not come up with a better explanation. Peach v Tesco Stores Plc [1998] C.L.Y. 1665, Mrs Peach, 65, slipped on a mangetout (a pea pod) in the store and hurt her hip, requiring surgery. She had recovered after 3 months but developed deep vein thrombosis. She got ¬£10,000 in compensation. Watford (A Minor) v Tesco Stores Ltd [1998] C.L.Y. 1672, in the Uxbridge County Court, a little boy, aged 2 at the time of the accident, won ¬£3850 after he slipped on some crisps. He fractured bones in his leg, and it took him three months before he was fully recovered. Kitching v Tesco Stores [1995] C.L.Y. 1731, Miss Kitching was a checkout lady, aged 22. She injured her wrist badly when she tried to stop some soft drinks falling on her. She won ¬£5500 for injury in the course of employment, because she had pain, possibly permanent, in her arm and she was hindered in her hobbies of swimming and writing to pen-pals. Corporate identity and signage casesNomenclature, domain names and terminology= Tesco Stores Ltd v Elogicom Ltd 2006 EWHC 403, Tesco won a passing off action against misuse of its Internet domain name. Weight Watchers UK Ltd v Tesco Stores Ltd 2003 EWHC 1109, Tesco fended off an action from Weight Watchers, that in using the word \\"points\\" for the fat and calorie content in its products was passing off Weight Watcher's name for its own scheme. =Secret sale of Brian Fords discount stores= In June 2008, it was revealed that Tesco had bought independent supermarket Brian Fords discount stores (with one store in Barnstaple, Devon, UK) five years previously, without notifying the public. Tesco submitted planning applications for a new supermarket early in 2008 under Brian Fords' name.

Tesco Ireland is the largest food retailer in Ireland, with over 13,500 employees. Tesco Ireland has come in for increased criticism for apparently high prices in its Irish stores, although in its favour this seems to be because comparisons are with the British Tesco stores rather than other Irish retailers ‚Äì and thus, officially speaking, like goods are not being compared with like. However, there have been general criticisms of the similar pricing between Irish supermarkets, and economic reports noting the high prices in Ireland generally. Research from Forfas, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South vis-a-vis their operations in the North, and the Minister for Enterprise queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially in excess of 5%. Tesco in Ireland was convicted of failing to properly display prices by the National Consumer Agency in July 2008. An advertisement in 2011 for pork sausages resulted in complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom) (ASA), for implying that the meat came from free range pigs. The complaints were upheld, with the ASA agreeing that the advertisement was misleading. Tesco said it was baffled because the farm shown supplied meat from pigs that were born outdoors and reared indoors. A report by the independent retailers group RGDATA contained allegations that Tesco overcharged customers. The report shows that customers in six Tesco stores were overcharged by an average of 3% on some items. In July 2008 Tesco Ireland was convicted of failing to display prices properly by the National Consumer Agency. Speaking to business leaders in Belfast, Tesco plc CEO argued that higher prices in Northern Ireland were due to higher energy costs and the cost of transporting goods from Great Britain. Though this doesn't explain the large disparities in pricing when goods are moved by truck between the Derry (UK) branches and Letterkenny (Ireland) branches - a distance of 21 miles - for example.

The report shows that customers in six Tesco stores were overcharged by an average of 3% on some items. Tesco Ireland was convicted of failing to display prices properly by the National Consumer Agency in July 2008. Tesco received criticism for bureaucratic and inflexible parking systems in its Bloomfield store in Dublin, Ireland. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland, has on a number of occasions ordered the recall of Tesco branded products, including a case of glass contamination. Environmental Health Officers served a closure order on Tesco's store in Prussia Street, Dublin, the day after they inspected it, for a number of breaches of Food Hygiene Regulations. Most food is imported from Britain, where the BBC's Whistleblower programme showed undercover footage showing the sale of products after their sell-by date; allegations that the company illegally sold 'back-labelled' products after their use by date; falsification of temperature records; and the sale of partially cooked mince mixed with uncooked mince. The British-owned supermarket, refused to stock any of the one million postcards which are aimed at closing the controversial plant at Sellafield in Cumbria. Dunnes Stores and Superquinn, along with other retailers across the country, did sell the postcards. The Advertising Standards Authority in January 2009 found that Tesco advertising was misleading . Tesco apologised for selling anti Jewish literature to customers in Ireland. Sheikh Dr Shaheed Satardien, head of the Muslim Council of Ireland, said this was effectively \\"polluting the minds of impressionable young Islamic people with hate and anger towards the Jewish community.\\" Bangladesh In Autumn 2006, Tesco was caught up in two scandals over the treatment of workers in factories supplying it in Bangladesh. The first was a Channel 4 News investigation, which found child labour in four such factories. The second was a report published by War on Want, which alleged that wages were as low as 5 pence per hour, with workers often working 80+ hour weeks. In its defence, Tesco said that, \\"All suppliers to Tesco must demonstrate that they meet our ethical standards on worker welfare, which are closely monitored. Our suppliers comply with local labour laws, and workers at all Bangladeshi suppliers to Tesco are paid above the national minimum wage.\\" Campaigners have argued that the minimum wage in Bangladesh is too low, and that monitoring systems used by clothing retailers are ineffective. China In September 2011 a Greenpeace report revealed that supermarkets in China, including Tesco, were selling vegetables that contained illegal pesticides or at levels exceeding the legal limit. 16 vegetable and fruit samples were taken from Tescos in Beijing and Guangzhou. Among them, 11 were found containing pesticide residues. One leafy vegetable sample turned up two kinds of pesticides, methamidophos and monocrotophos, the use of which have been prohibited in China since the beginning of year 2007. In December 2019, the BBC reported allegations of forced prison labour from China in the Tesco's supply chain. Hungary There have been several complaints against Tesco in Hungary, both by customers and employees. Two trade unionists employed by the company were dismissed in June 2010. They had persuaded an employee and his family to report a serious accident which had resulted in injury. The company claimed that the unionists had put pressure on both the employee and his relatives in an 'unethical and dishonest manner' which had 'violated good faith and respectability'. According to Istvan Gask√≥, President of the Democratic League of Independent Trade Unions (LIGA) Tesco's actions were in breach of the Hungarian Labour Code, which states that employers are required to consult with the trade union prior to any dismissal of a unionist, which had not taken place. In a recent scandal an employee, asking for her name to be kept confidential, revealed that her bosses told her, on several occasions, not to dispose of smelly raw meat products, instead she was instructed to wash the meat with sodium hypochlorite and sell it later on. Occasionally, the smelly meat product was grilled and sold like that Allegations were made in the national press that Tesco was stifling operation in some regions and using unnecessarily harsh disciplinary procedures on its employees since the Millennium. Thailand In Thailand, Tesco has been criticised for aggressively pursuing critics of the company. Writer and former MP Jit Siratranont faced up to two years in jail and a ¬£16.4m libel damages claim for saying that Tesco was expanding aggressively at the expense of small local retailers. Tesco served him with writs for criminal defamation and civil libel. The case was subsequently dismissed. In Thailand another controversy arose when the Royal Thai Police alleged that Thai soldiers operating as Tesco security intimidated a rural boy into poisoning chocolates as revenge for having their contracts revoked by the company. The Cayman Islands In February 2008, a six-month investigation by The Guardian revealed that Tesco has developed a complex taxation structure involving offshore bank accounts in the tax haven of the Cayman Islands. The Guardian claimed that this arrangement would enable Tesco to avoid an estimated ¬£1 billion tax on profits from the property sales, and also to avoid paying any tax on continuing operation of the stores, as the rate of corporation tax in the Cayman Islands is zero. The USA American union leaders, aspiring to represent employees of Tesco's Fresh & Easy brand, have complained that a \\"stark contrast\\" exists between the way the supermarket chain treats its British workers and staff at its US business.

Having started work as boy as a stonecutter at mines of Besazio, Vela received his initial training at Viggi√π and then moved to Milan, where he worked on the Cathedral and enrolled at the Brera Academy of Fine Arts in 1832. In Milan, he worked under Professor Cacciatori. The influence of Lorenzo Bartolini‚Äôs work led to the adoption of a naturalistic approach and the early 1840s saw a number of figures in contemporary dress in obvious contrast to the classical approach still dominant in sculpture. Francesco Hayez played an active part in securing prestigious commissions for him from the liberal aristocracy and bourgeoisie of Lombardy, above all for works of a patriotic nature alluding to the Italian political situation. After a short stay in Rome, he enlisted in 1848 to serve as a volunteer in the first war of independence. He then moved to Turin, where he held the chair in sculpture at the Albertina Academy, in 1852. His repertoire of funerary monuments, portraits and public works drawing inspiration from the struggle for national liberation proved a great success also in France, where his work dedicated to the last days of Napoleon‚Äôs life won a prize at the Paris Universal Exhibition of 1867 and ensured his renown. He returned to Ligornetto in the same year and took up residence in the villa built to house the works from his studios in Turin. His mature production is characterised by a repertoire of portraits and funerary monuments, and includes a naturalistic relief dedicated to the 199 workers killed during the construction of the Gotthard Rail Tunnel (1882‚Äì83). His first piece winning an award at a contest at the Brera was a bas-relief depicting the Return of Ulysses to Ithaca. He then won in a Venetian competition (gold medal and 60 zecchini) from among submissions from Northern Italy with a model for a sculpture depicting Christ resurrects that daughter of Jair. With this award he traveled to Rome, to study and work. Vela returned to Milan to fight in the wars of the Italians against Austria. Once the rebellion was staunched, Vela completed the marble statue of Spartacus breaking his Chains; the resonance of the theme would not have been lost on Italian patriots. Vela refused the offer by the Austrian authorities to join the Academy of Fine Arts of Milan. He was imprisoned for his political views, and exiled to his hometown in Switzerland. There he began work on his statue of the carabiniere Francesco Cartoni, killed by the Austrians at Sommacampagna, and a statue of William Tell for Lugano. In 1852, he accepted a professorship at the Accademia Albertina of Turin. There he completed Rassegnazione, for the Contessa Loschi of Vicenza; a statue for the mathematician Piola; a statue of the poet Tommaso Grossi, one of the philosopher Rosmini; a Minerva for Lisbon; a statue of Count Cavour for the atrium of the Bourse in Genoa; a Monument to Donizetti with an allegorical female representing Harmony crying beside the portrait of great master. His statue of Hope was for the funereal monument of the Prever Family of Turin; his Cesare Balbo, for the public gardens of Turin; he made two statues of the two queens Maria Adelaide and Maria Teresa; Primavera, for the Bott√†ccini family of Trieste; L'Alfiere combattente, standing before the palazzo Madama in Turin. He completes a Monument to Manin in Turin. Vela completed a Vittorio Emanuele, for the Palazzo Civico of Turin; a Carlo Alberto, for the Royal Palace; a statue of Joachim Murat, For the camposanto of the Certosa in Bologna he completed: statues of Dante and Giotto for Prato della Valle in Padoa; and la Pregante. At the French Exposition of 1863, Vela exhibited: L' Italia riconoscente alla Francia, donated by Milan to empress Eugenia. She also commissioned a statue of Christopher Columbus in bronze for Vera Cruz, Mexico.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti., by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, page 541. He exhibited an Ecce Homo in Rome in 1883. L'Illustrazione italiana (1883) Volume 10, pages 313,314. Museo Vincenzo Vela His son, Spartaco Vela (1853-1895), was a landscape painter who trained at the Brera Academy. Spartaco willed the house and works in his father's studio to the Swiss government for the establishment of a museum: Museo Vincenzo Vela in Ligornetto. The house designed by the architect Cipriano Ajmetti, was restructured in 2001 by architect Mario Botta, and displays the works of the sculptor in a novel setting. The museum displays some of Spartaco's paintings and sculptures of his uncle Lorenzo Vela. The museum also contains contemporary paintings collected by the three Velas. Those of Lorenzo, include works of Ambrogio Preda (1839-1906), Luigi Scrosati (1814-1869), Giuseppe Landriani (1824-1894), Eleuterio Pagliano (1826-1903), Bartolomeo Giuliano (1825-1909), Federico Faruffini (1833-1869), and Mos√© Bianchi (1840-1904). Those of Spartaco include works from his Milanese circle of painters, including by his friend Giovanni Segantini (1858-1899), Eugenio Spreafico (1856-1919), FiIippo Carcano, Pio Sanquirico (1847-1900), and Franceso Fiocchi (1856-1936). Those works collected by Vincenzo include works by Gaetano Fasanotti (1831-1882), Ernesto Allason (1822-1869), Leone Eydoux (1829-1875), the brothers Domenico (1815-1878) and Gerolamo Induno (1827-1890), Enrico Gamba (1825-1909), Giuseppe Bertini (1825-1898), and Pierre (Henri Theodore) Tetar van Elven (1828-1908).Museo Vincenzo Vela Official Site.

It is the most common form of migration in ecology. It is found in all major animal groups, including birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans. The trigger for the migration may be local climate, local availability of food, the season of the year or for mating reasons.National Geographic. Why Animals Migrate To be counted as a true migration, and not just a local dispersal or irruption, the movement of the animals should be an annual or seasonal occurrence, such as Northern Hemisphere birds migrating south for the winter; wildebeest migrating annually for seasonal grazing; or a major habitat change as part of their life, such as young Atlantic salmon or sea lamprey leaving the river of their birth when they have reached a few inches in size. Overview A Christmas Island red crab on its migration Migration can take very different forms in different species, and as such there is no simple accepted definition of migration. One of the most commonly used definitions, proposed by Kennedy is Migration encompasses four related concepts: persistent straight movement; relocation of an individual on a greater scale (both spatially and temporally) than its normal daily activities; seasonal to-and-fro movement of a population between two areas; and movement leading to the redistribution of individuals within a population. Migration can be either obligate, meaning individuals must migrate, or facultative, meaning individuals can \\"choose\\" to migrate or not. Within a migratory species or even within a single population, often not all individuals migrate. Complete migration is when all individuals migrate, partial migration is when some individuals migrate while others do not, and differential migration is when the difference between migratory and non- migratory individuals is based on age or sex (for example). While most migratory movements occur on an annual cycle, some daily movements are also referred to as migration. Many aquatic animals make a diel vertical migration, travelling a few hundred meters up and down the water column, while some jellyfish make daily horizontal migrations, traveling a few hundred meters across a lake. Irregular (non-cyclical) migrations such as irruptions can occur under pressure of famine, overpopulation of a locality, or some more obscure influence. Seasonal migration is the movement of various species from one habitat to another during the year. Resource availability changes depending on seasonal fluctuations, which influence migration patterns. Some species such as Pacific salmon migrate to reproduce; every year they swim upstream to mate and then return to the ocean. Temperature is a driving factor of migration that is dependent on the time of year. Many species, especially birds, migrate to warmer locations during the winter to escape poor environmental conditions. Circadian migration is where birds utilize circadian rhythm (CR) to regulate migration in both the fall and the spring. In circadian migration clocks of both circadian (daily) and circannual (annual) patterns are utilized to determine the birds‚Äô orientation in both time and space as they migrate from one destination to the next. This type of migration is advantageous in birds that during the winter remain close to the equator, and also allows the monitoring of the auditory and spatial memory of the birds‚Äô brain to remember an optimal site of migration. These birds also have timing mechanisms that provide avians with the distance required to travel in order to reach their destination. To regulate the migration patterns of these birds, the mammalian circadian clock is utilized. This clock allows birds to determine when the appropriate time is to migrate, which location will best help them regulate their metabolism, and whether land or water travel will be most advantageous. Tidal migration is the use of tides by organisms to move periodically from one habitat to another. This type of migration is often used in order to find food or mates. Tides can carry organisms horizontally and vertically for as little as a few nanometers to even thousands of kilometers. The most common form of tidal migration is to and from Intertidal zone during daily tidal cycles. These zones are often populated by many different species and are nutrient rich. Organisms like crabs, nematodes, small fish, corals, and other species cycle to these areas as the tides rise and fall typically about every twelve hours. The cycle movements are associated with foraging of marine and bird species. Typically, during low tide smaller or younger species will emerge to forage because they can survive in the shallower water and have less chance of being preyed upon. During high tide, larger species can be found due to the deeper water and nutrient upwelling from the tidal movements. Tidal migration is often facilitated by ocean currents. In specific groups Flocks of birds assembling before migration southwards Different kinds of animal migrate in different ways. In birds Approximately 1,800 of the world's 10,000 bird species migrate long distances each year in response to the seasons. Many of these migrations are north-south, with species feeding and breeding in high northern latitudes in the summer, and moving some hundreds of kilometres south for the winter. Some species extend this strategy to migrate annually between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The Arctic tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year, a distance of at least , giving it two summers every year. In fish Many species of salmon migrate up rivers to spawn Most fish species are relatively limited in their movements, remaining in a single geographical area and making short migrations for wintering, to spawn, or to feed. A few hundred species migrate long distances, in some cases of thousands of kilometres. About 120 species of fish, including several species of salmon, migrate between saltwater and freshwater (they are 'diadromous').Harden Jones, F. R. Fish Migration: strategy and tactics. pp139‚Äì166 in Aidley, 1981. Forage fish such as herring and capelin migrate around substantial parts of the North Atlantic ocean. The capelin for example spawn around the southern and western coasts of Iceland; their larvae drift clockwise around Iceland, while the fish swim northwards towards Jan Mayen island to feed, and return to Iceland parallel with Greenland's east coast. In the 'sardine run', billions of Southern African pilchard Sardinops sagax spawn in the cool waters of the Agulhas Bank and move northward along the east coast of South Africa between May and July. In insects An aggregation of migratory Pantala flavescens dragonflies, known as globe skimmers, in Coorg, India Some winged insects such as locusts and certain butterflies and dragonflies with strong flight migrate long distances. Among the dragonflies, species of Libellula and Sympetrum are known for mass migration, while Pantala flavescens, known as the globe skimmer or wandering glider dragonfly, makes the longest ocean crossing of any insect, between India and Africa. Exceptionally, swarms of the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, flew westwards across the Atlantic Ocean for 4500 km during October 1988, using air currents in the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone. In some migratory butterflies, such as the monarch butterfly and the painted lady, no individual completes the whole migration. Instead the butterflies mate and reproduce on the journey, and successive generations travel the next stage of the migration. In mammals Wildebeest on the Serengeti 'great migration' Some mammals exhibit extraordinary migrations, with caribou having one of the longest known terrestrial migrations on the planet, reaching as much as 4868 km/year in North America. However, over the course of a year, gray wolves move the most. One gray wolf, in particular, covered a total cumulative annual distance (TCAD) of 7247 km. Mass migration occurs in mammals such as the Serengeti 'great migration', an annual circular pattern of movement with some 1.7 million wildebeest and hundreds of thousands of other large game animals including gazelles and zebra. A literature survey in 2009 found more than 20 species which engage, or used to engage, in mass migrations. Of these migrations, those of the springbok, black wildebeest, blesbok, scimitar-horned oryx, and kulan have ceased. Cites Harris et al. See figure. Long-distance migrations occur in some bats, notably the mass migration of the Mexican free- tailed bat between Oregon and southern Mexico. Migration is important in cetaceans, including whales, dolphins and porpoises.Lockyer, C.H. and Brown, S.G. The Migration of Whales. pp. 105‚Äì137 in Aidley, 1981.  In other animals  Some reptiles and amphibians migrate. Some crustaceans migrate, most spectacularly the Christmas Island red crab which moves en masse each year by the million. Tracking migration monarch, tagged for identification Scientists gather observations of animal migration by tracking their movements. Animals were traditionally tracked with identification tags such as bird rings for later recovery; no information was obtained about the actual route followed between release and recovery, and only a small fraction of tagged individuals were generally recovered. More convenient, therefore, are electronic devices such as radio tracking collars which can be followed by radio, whether handheld, in a vehicle or aircraft, or by satellite. Tags can include a GPS receiver, enabling accurate positions to be broadcast at regular intervals, but these are inevitably heavier and more expensive than devices without GPS. An alternative is the Argos Doppler tag, also called a 'Platform Transmitter Terminal' (PTT) which sends regularly to the polar-orbiting Argos satellites; using Doppler shift, the animal's location can be estimated, relatively roughly compared to GPS, but at lower cost and weight. Radio tracking tags can be fitted to insects including dragonflies and bees. In culture Before animal migration was understood, various folklore and erroneous explanations sprang up to account for the disappearance or sudden arrival of birds in an area. In Ancient Greece, Aristotle proposed that robins turned into redstarts when summer arrived. The barnacle goose was explained in European Medieval bestiaries and manuscripts as either growing like fruit on trees, or developing from goose barnacles on pieces of driftwood. Another example is the swallow, which was once thought, even by naturalists such as Gilbert White, to hibernate either underwater, buried in muddy riverbanks, or in hollow trees.

It is the third game to use its gameplay, and is the sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan while incorporating many of the improvements in gameplay made in Elite Beat Agents. The game has 4-player wireless play,Joystiq - Elite Beat Agents sequel is on (oh yes) supports the Nintendo DS Rumble Pak accessory, and was released in Japan on May 17, 2007.Ouendan 2 Coming Next Month Storyline Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii follows more or less the storyline from the original Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan, and is set roughly six years after the original game based on the game manual and the age differences of returning characters. Players act as the leader of a three-person cheerleading squad. Whenever someone is stressed out or backed into a corner, all they need to do is shout \\"Ouendan!\\" (Japanese for \\"Cheer Squad\\"). Then, the Ouendan appear (usually out of a place like a closet or waiting there while eating ramen) and use cheering and dance to help that someone through their troubles. The map of the territory that the Ouendan patrol within Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii is the same as that found in the original game, although it has been turned ninety degrees and is now rendered using 3D graphics. The original Ouendan (signified by wearing their long Gakuran jackets) are still present in this game, cheering people on. However, a new rival Ouendan appear that challenge the original Ouendan in skill and cheering (the \\"new\\" Ouendan are signified by their blue military-style outfits.) The individual stories are all unrelated, but characters featured in one stage may appear as background or supporting characters in another. One can also see characters from the first Ouendan game as lead, supporting or background characters, such as the pottery maker from the first game that appears as a guest at a hot springs, and gifts the hot springs family with new pottery work should the player be successful in the stage. In the final stage, all of the characters in the game unite when the two Ouendan join together and once again lead the entire world in a cheer to save Earth when the sun's activity stops, plunging Earth into another ice age. Gameplay As in the original game, this sequel is played almost entirely via touch screen (the only actual face button used is the Start button for pausing the game). The player acts as the Ouendan, who cheer on the people that are in turmoil and shout out for them (the original \\"Black\\" Ouendan control the west side of that world, Y≈´hi Town, and the new \\"Blue\\" Ouendan control the east side, Asahi Town.) The gameplay plays out identically to that found in the first Ouendan; the player must tap colored circles in precise time with the music in order to cheer the character through his or her problems. There are three types of marker: *Hit Markers: These need to be tapped to the beat. *Phrase Markers: When this is tapped, the stylus must be held down and follow a ball sliding along a track. If an arrow appears at the end of the track, the player must run the stylus back in the opposite direction. *Spin Markers: At certain points, a large wheel appears. Players must spin the wheel by making circular motions on the screen (either direction will do.) Once the required amount of spin has been cleared, further spinning will earn bonus points. The top screen displays the stage's protagonist overcoming his or her dilemma. If the player's cheering is good, then the meter at the top of the touch screen stays in the yellow, and the character is seen triumphing over whatever it is holding him or her back. If the player's cheering is bad, then the meter on the top of the screen falls to the red and the character struggles. If the player's performance is particularly poor, the meter will hit the bottom and the mission will end in failure. Then, the player can either try again, quit to do something else, or review the last five seconds of gameplay up to where he or she lost. At intervals in the song, the story progresses on the top screen. If the meter remains in the yellow, then the story will progress positively (scoring an \\"O\\") and if the meter is in the red, it will progress negatively (scoring an \\"X\\"). The number of Os and Xs given will determine the story's outcome from one of three possibilities: a good ending, which results in a special illustration, an average ending, or a bad ending. The final two levels do not adhere to this pattern. Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii contains multiple enhancements over the original game, many of which were first featured in Elite Beat Agents. These features include the ability to save stage replay data and use it later in a \\"ghost versus\\" mode, 4-player wireless play, Rumble Pak compatibility, multiple stage endings depending on the player's performance, and the ability to skip intro and epilogue sections of each stage. Also, as the player earns new ranks by achieving cumulative high score totals across all stages and difficulties, three additional bonus stages are unlocked when specific ranks are earned. Brand-new features introduced to the series for the first time in Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii include the ability to save 20 replay data files: in Elite Beat Agents, players could only save one replay for each song regardless of difficulty, and saving a new one would overwrite it. Moreover, on the easiest difficulty, the player can continue a failed stage from the point the failure occurred, beginning with half of the life bar. It is also possible to unlock a mode in which the game's timer circles/markers are disabled, forcing the player to hit the markers with only the rhythm of the music as a guide. On the Kigaru ni ≈åen mode, only the timer circles are missing. On all other difficulty levels, the whole marker disappears, and as the player moves up the difficulty levels, the markers disappear faster. The game also includes an unlockable gallery featuring pictures of the various cheer teams unlocked each time a specific player rank is reached, the \\"end of stage\\" images, and the Story mode scenes. The multiplayer mode has also been upgraded, as players are now allowed to use the male cheerleaders on Karei ni ≈åen mode. They retain their male animations, except their dancing corresponds to the positioning of the Very Hard markers. Likewise, the player is allowed to use a Cheer Girl on the easier difficulties, retaining the female moves, but the dances correspond to the male markers. As well as being able to skip song intros, players can now skip the ending sequence of songs they have previously completed. Elite Beat Agents characters Between June 28 and July 11, 2007, players could use a Japanese DS Download Station to unlock additional characters from Elite Beat Agents. This can also be achieved with an Action Replay DS. This provides an \\"EBA Mode\\" which replaces both Ouendan squads in the single-player game with the Elite Beat Agents or the Elite Beat Divas (although cutscenes and pictures are unaltered), and also allows the use of Agent J and the Ramen Shop Cat in multiplayer matches. In the final stage, the Elite Beat Agents replace the original Ouendan, while the backup dancers of the Blue Ouendan are led by the Ramen Shop Cat. Animations do not change, other than the fact that their right hands never open due to the microphone's presence.  Notes ReferencesExternal links *Official Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu!

He was the pupil and successor of Diogenes of Babylon as leader of the Stoic school, and was the teacher of Panaetius. He wrote works on the gods and on divination, and in ethics he took a higher moral ground than that of his teacher Diogenes. Life Very little is known about Antipater's life, except that he was the disciple and successor of Diogenes of Babylon as leader of the Stoic school in Athens, and he was the teacher of Panaetius.Cicero, de Divinatione, i. 3, de Officiis, iii. 12. The few extant accounts of his philosophical opinions would not be sufficient grounds for any great reputation, if it were not for the testimony of ancient authors to his merit. Plutarch speaks of him with Zeno, Cleanthes, and Chrysippus, as one of the principal Stoic philosophers,Plutarch, de Stoic. Repugnant. and Cicero mentions him as remarkable for acuteness.Cicero, de Officiis, iii. 12. He seems to have taken the lead during his lifetime in the disputes constantly recurring between his own school and the Academy, although he is said to have felt himself so unequal in argument to his contemporary Carneades in public debates, that he confined himself to writing; by which he was called \\"Pen-noise\\" ().Plutarch, Moralia: On Talkativeness; Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica, xiv. 8. Philosophy Antipater taught belief in God as \\"a Being blessed, incorruptible, and of goodwill to men,\\" and blamed those who ascribed to the gods \\"generation and corruption,\\" which is said to have been the doctrine of Chrysippus.Plutarch, de Stoic. Rep. Besides this treatise on the gods, he also wrote two books on divination, a common topic among the Stoics, in which he proved the truth of the subject from the foreknowledge and benevolence of God, explained dreams to be supernatural intimations of the future, and collected stories of divination attributed to Socrates.Cicero, de Divinatione, i. 3, 20, 39, 54. He is said to have believed that Fate was a god, though it is not clear what was implied in this expression;Stobaeus, de Fato, 16 and it appears from Athenaeus that he wrote a treatise entitled On Superstition ().Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, viii. Of Antipater's labours in moral philosophy nothing remains except a few scattered statements which concern points of detail, and have more to do with the application of moral precepts than with the principles themselves; such as they were, however, he took higher ground in solving them than his master Diogenes:Cicero, de Officiis, iii. 12, 13, 23. > If a wise man should inadvertently accept counterfeit money for good, will > he offer it as genuine in payment of a debt after he discovers his mistake?\\" > Diogenes says, \\"Yes,\\" Antipater, \\"No,\\" and I agree with him. If a man > knowingly offers for sale wine that is spoiling, ought he to tell his > customers? Diogenes thinks that it is not required; Antipater holds that an > honest man would do so.Cicero, de Officiis, iii. 23.

They also help locate missing people. Shomrim volunteers are unarmed and do not have the authority to make arrests, other than citizen's arrest.

Some Call Them Bullies.\\" The New York Times, 17 June 2016. In Brooklyn, Baltimore, and London many residents call Shomrim prior to the police due to the former's shorter response time. However, one of the volunteer patrols in New York has been criticised by the New York City Police Department for not always notifying police when a call comes in. In London, however, the Hackney Police Borough Commander Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne complimented Shomrim on this point, saying that \\"they will generally know when is the time to call us. They don't tend to waste our time and they don't let people go\\". Additionally, Brooklyn Shomrim organisers have been accused of withholding information on suspected child molesters and other Jewish criminals, in keeping with an interpretation of the Torah prohibition against mesirah (informing on a fellow Jew to the non-Jewish authorities). History The forerunner of the Shomrim was the Maccabees, a Jewish patrol organization founded by Samuel Schrage in 1964 in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn. While initially successful, it was disbanded at the end of the decade due to political pressure amid allegations of lack of oversight and tense relations with the African American community.Shaer, Matthew (14 December 2011) \\"Tough Jews\\", Tablet. Retrieved 11 February 2020. Shomrim was first established in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Borough Park, Crown Heights, Flatbush, and Williamsburg in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Similar patrols were later established in Haredi neighborhoods in Monsey, New York, Baltimore, Miami, Waterbury, Connecticut, and London, United Kingdom. In around 1998, a split in the organization occurred in Crown Heights when the rival group Shomrim broke off from the original group Shmira. This was the first time two competing groups were patrolling the same neighborhood. Volunteers Shomrim volunteers, who are unpaid, are mostly members of the Haredi Jewish communities that they serve; however, around 70% of the victims they help are not from the Orthodox Jewish community, usually just local residents from any race or religion. Despite previous reports, London Shomrim does not require that its members must be Jewish, male, employed or married, according to Stamford Hill Shomrim volunteer Michael Scher. In Brooklyn, Shomrim members, according to their coordinator, are fingerprinted and checked for a criminal record before being allowed to join the patrol. In Stamford Hill, London, Shomrim volunteers undergo training according to Security Industry Authority standards and are CRB checked prior to joining as a volunteer. Shomrim volunteers - who range from a few dozen to over 100, depending on the group - work on foot or in cars. Generally, members work two to a vehicle that is equipped with a radio and a siren. However, the UK divisions of Shomrim do not have audible or visual warning equipment (blues- and-twos) fitted in their vehicles. Some Brooklyn patrols have marked cars which resemble New York City Police Department (NYPD) vehicles, but most use their own, unmarked cars. The patrols may also carry walkie-talkies. They wear identifying jackets and yarmulkes on the job. The volunteers, says a coordinator, do not carry guns, batons, pepper spray, or handcuffs, and do not have the authority to make arrests. However, they are trained in how to safely track and detain suspects until police arrive, otherwise known as citizen's arrest. They have been known to quickly mobilize area residents to block off streets in order to stop suspects. Operations Each Shomrim group maintains its own dispatcher and 24-hour hotline, whose number is known throughout the Orthodox Jewish community. Shomrim responds to a wide variety of crimes and cases, including reports of purse snatching, vandalism, car and bicycle thefts, and missing people. Volunteers patrol the city streets in the overnight hours as a deterrent presence. When they are not on duty, they remain on call,\\"This is an Emergency!: An interview with Chaim Deutsch of Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol\\", Binah Bunch, 4 February 2008, pp. 14-15. and are often summoned to help other Shomrim groups or other Jewish community rescue organizations such as Hatzalah and Chaverim during large-scale search and rescue operations. Shomrim has been effective in apprehending suspects of burglaries robberies, assault, car thefts, vandalism, domestic violence, nuisance crimes, and antisemitic attacks. In an incident in 2010, four Brooklyn South Shomrim volunteers gave chase to a suspected child predator who drew a gun and shot each of them, after they had tackled him to the ground. The shooter was later acquitted of all charges except possessing a gun. Following that incident, the Brooklyn South Shomrim were issued bullet-proof vests by the New York State Senate. Shomrim volunteers have occasionally been criticized for using excessive force with suspects, particularly non-Jews. In 1996 a Crown Heights Shomrim volunteer was convicted of assault charges after repeatedly hitting a suspect on the head with a walkie-talkie after the man had been subdued. In 2010 a Baltimore Shomrim volunteer, an ex-Israeli Special Forces soldier, was arrested for striking a black 15 year old. The boy had been walking along a road in the early afternoon when a van with males started to drive next to him. The boy, who the judge said was frightened, took a nail- studded board from a construction site. The ex-soldier hit him with a walky- talky and, with help from two others, was held the boy on the ground for 8 to 10 minutes. He was suspended pending internal investigation, with Shomrim confident that he would be vindicated in court, and was sentenced to three years of probation in 2012 and ordered to research and write essays on cultural diversity. In 2011, two Monsey Shomrim volunteers were charged with misdemeanors in a fracas that erupted after a girl hit a passing van with a water balloon. Many Shomrim organisations call together an annual Community Engagement Event, with advice on crime prevention and bike registration.http://nmbshmira.com/gal.htm Police relations and controversy Shomrim maintains a delicate working relationship with local police departments and Shomrim regularly shares its information on crime with officers. The relationship is a sensitive one, however. Many residents of Hasidic neighborhoods in Brooklyn, Baltimore, and Stamford Hill tend to call Shomrim in an emergency rather than the police. Shomrim cites its faster response time, knowledge of the territory, and ability to speak Yiddish, the language of the Hasidic community, for the residents' preference. On occasion, Shomrim members have helped community members evade law enforcement.(11 January 2019) \\"NYPD Traffic Agent Harassed for Towing Vehicle in Borough Park\\", News12 Brooklyn. Retrieved 22 February 2019. While the expectation is for Shomrim to notify police, this is done in some cases but not in others. Former New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has publicly stated that Shomrim does not immediately notify police when a call comes in. This was highlighted in the 2011 missing-child case of Leiby Kletzky (see below): the first call by Kletzky's mother reporting her missing child was received by Brooklyn South Shomrim more than two hours before Kletzky's father called the police. The Brooklyn South Shomrim explains that it does not always notify police immediately in cases of missing children, since it receives at least 10 such calls a day and is experienced in quickly locating children by searching candy stores, buses, and relatives' homes. In London, however, the Hackney Police Borough Commander Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne complimented Shomrim on this point, saying that \\"they will generally know when is the time to call us. They don't tend to waste our time and they don't let people go\\". In Brooklyn, the civilian patrol has been accused of withholding information about suspected local child molesters. One Brooklyn South Shomrim member acknowledged to the press that they maintain a file of suspected local child molesters, and some believe that this file includes the suspects' photos and the make, model and license-plate number of their cars. But Shomrim does not share this information with police due to the Torah prohibition against mesirah (informing on a fellow Jew to the non-Jewish authorities). However, another high-ranking member claims that the other member was misquoted, and that the list that Brooklyn South Shomrim maintains is culled from the New York Sex Offender Registry. Members of the Williamsburg Shomrim always consult a rabbi before involving police in a crime committed by one Jew against another. Shomrim have on many occasions received awards and commendations from the police for their work. The founding of Shomrim organizations in North West London and Stamford Hill in 2008 initially met with disapproval by the London Metropolitan Police, which questioned the existence of a community patrol working in tandem with trained police officers and claimed they were endangering themselves. In 2009, a new borough commander in Hackney Chief Superintendent Steve Bending consulted with the NYPD to draw up a list of expectations for the volunteer patrol. The Stamford Hill Shomrim and the North West London Shomrim agreed to have its members undergo background checks and sign a code of conduct, and pledged to implement disciplinary measures for members who \\"act inappropriately\\". Today the Hackney borough commander commends Shomrim in its role as \\"evidence-gathers\\" and support for police activities. and they have received public praise from the higher ranks. including most recently Stamford Hill Shomrim received a formal commendation award from the local Metropolitan Police Borough Commander Stamford Hill Shomrim members receive ongoing training from the Police at Stoke Newington Police Station and are kept updated about new, targeted police operations in the area. Funding Shomrim organizations receive voluntary donations mostly from members of the Orthodox Jewish Community they serve. New York Shomrim groups have been successful at securing taxpayer funding in member earmarks for their operations, allowing them to buy sophisticated equipment. Commentators cite the groups' effectiveness and also their political clout as a voting bloc that follows rabbis' direction. List of Shomrim organizations Shomrim organizations in each neighbourhood or city operates independently. There are some exceptions, where there is a tight affiliation with neighbouring Shomrim organizations, a loose affiliation of neighbouring Shomrim organizations, or some other basic level of cooperation. New York CityBrooklyn South Shomrim= A BSSP Shomrim patrol emblem/shoulder patch circa 1990s to present. The Shomrim-run Brooklyn South Safety Patrol (BSSP), which covers the neighborhoods of Boro Park, Bensonhurst, and Kensington, has its origins in the 1980s when it was founded by Jacob Daskal. In the beginning the group was known as the \\"Bakery Boys\\" as its members were bakers who observed late-night car break-ins in progress. Its command center is located in a tire shop. The dispatchers, owners of the tire shop, receive about 100 calls a day and direct a force of 150 members. Brooklyn South Shomrim came to international attention as the coordinator of a massive volunteer search for Leiby Kletzky, an 8-year-old Boro Park boy who went missing while walking home from day camp in July 2011; he was later found murdered by a Kensington resident. The Brooklyn South command center alerted other Shomrim patrols in Flatbush, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights, as well as Haredi communities in Monsey, Monroe, Lawrence, Passaic, and Lakewood, to mobilize up to 5,000 Orthodox Jewish volunteers for a block-by-block search for the missing boy. After police identified the suspect's car from surveillance videos, two Flatbush volunteers searching in nearby Kensington spotted the car; the suspect was apprehended by police shortly after. Later the Brooklyn South Shomrim maintained order at the huge funeral for the victim and outside the parents' home during the week-long shiva period. In April 2016, Alex Lichtenstein, a former Brooklyn South Shomrim leader who was Boro Park's liaison to the NYPD, was charged with bribing police officers to obtain 150 gun permits for $6,000 a piece, then selling them to community members for $18,000. Upon his sentencing on 16 March 2017 to 32 months imprisonment and a $20,000 fine, Judge Sidney H. Stein said, \\"Mr. Lichtenstein has led a life of great deeds. He has also committed a great crime. You participated in corrupting the New York City police department\\".Whiehouse, Kaja and Jaeger, Max (16 March 2017) \\"Judge Goes Easy on Shomrim Leader who Bribed Cops for Gun Permits\\", New York Post On 10 May 2018, Daskal was arrested by the NYPD on suspicion of statutory rape of a 16-year-old girl. He was charged the next day with third-degree rape, a criminal sex act, sexual abuse, forcible touching, and acting in a manner injurious to a child less than 17.Baker, Al (11 May 2018) \\"Brooklyn Safety Patrol Leader Is Charged in Sex Abuse of Teen\\", New York Times The revelation was followed by Daskal's immediate resignation from his post as campaign treasurer for Simcha Eichenstein, a New York State Assembly candidate from the neighborhood.Blau, Reuven (16 May 2018) \\"Treasurer for Brooklyn Assemblyman Hopeful‚Äôs Campaign Steps Down Amid Child Rape Accusations\\", New York Daily News Authorities believe the abuse took place at Daskal's home in Boro Park between August and November 2017. =Crown Heights Shomrim= Crown Heights Shomrim was founded in 1977. It expanded its operations following the 1991 Crown Heights riots. Members, driving repainted police cars, respond to armed robberies, burglaries, and assaults in progress, as well as automobile accidents and general assistance to residents. While they are not authorized to make arrests, they will chase suspects and try to detain them by surrounding them and talking to them until police arrive. =Boro Park Shmira (CWSP)= Boro Park Shmira is the name of a rival safety patrol in Borough Park.Nathan-Kazis, Josh (20 April 2016) \\"Orthodox Shomrim Patrol Faces New Questions After Brooklyn Bribery Scandal\\", Forward. Retrieved 11 February 2020. It was founded in 2010 and has over 100 members. =Flatbush Shomrim= The Flatbush Shomrim Safety Patrol, originally known as Brooklyn Midwood Shomrim, was founded in 1991 by Chaim Deutsch with the support of neighborhood rabbinic leaders. At the time, police did not have the manpower to respond immediately to crimes in progress. The group's 40 volunteers patrol in their own, unmarked cars and use high-powered binoculars to view suspects at a distance. If they see a crime in progress, they summon police, who respond promptly. Often the Shomrim volunteers serve as witnesses for the filing of police reports. Members also carry special equipment for opening locked houses and cars. In 2009 the Flatbush Shomrim acquired a $250,000 mobile security command center which is similar to NYPD command centers, including a state-of-the-art communications system, flat-panel television, computer, fax machine, portable defibrillator, a toilet incinerator that can convert solid waste to ash, conference room, and kitchen. =Williamsburg Shomrim= The Williamsburg Shomrim was founded in 1977 by a local resident, in response to a wave of violent muggings perpetuated on Jewish residents by non-Jews. Today, the majority of calls received by Williamsburg Shomrim deal with car theft, missing children, and graffiti. In 2011, most of its 50 members worked six nights a week. As of 2019, it has over 100 members. In 2013 a Shomrim patrol attacked a student in south Williamsburg. The victim, who remains blind in his left eye, stated that while beating him, the men yelled homophobic slurs. Five suspects were arrested; one was convicted of gang assault and other charges all of which were later overturned on appeal, two pled guilty to lesser offenses and were sentenced to probation and community service in \\"culturally diverse neighborhoods\\", and two had the charges dismissed as the witnesses recanted their identification. The patrol had claimed to be responding to reports of car vandalism, but this was deemed \\"unfounded.\\"Hasidic Man Found Guilty of Gang Assault in Beating of Black Student in Brooklyn Eastern United StatesBaltimore Shomrim= Baltimore Shomrim was founded in 2005 in response to a rash of burglaries in the city's Orthodox Jewish community. In its first five years, the organization received over 4,600 calls for assistance. Members - generally local Orthodox businessmen and shopkeepers - wear matching jackets and carry two-way radios. The organization divides the area under surveillance into quadrants and responds quickly to all calls. Among the calls for help are bicycle thefts, missing children, and suicide attempts. =Lakewood Civilian Safety Watch= The Lakewood Civilian Safety Watch, commonly known as the Lakewood Shomrim, was formed in 2006 by Chaim Rubin and Aaron KugielskyGecan, Alex N. (2 July 2016) \\"Inside Lakewood's Controversial Watch Group\\", Asbury Park Press after an incident in which a local cheder teacher walking home one evening was attacked by an assailant with a steel bat.Burstyn, Rochel. \\"Meet LCSW\\". Binyan, 25 June 2015, pp. 8-9. As of 2015, the group has more than 60 Jewish volunteers, as well as non-Jewish personnel who work on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. The organization patrols the streets of Lakewood Township, New Jersey in marked cars. It fields an average of 400 calls a month. It also conducts public awareness campaigns for summer safety, school bus safety, and driving safety, and bicycle registration drives. =Miami-Dade Shmira Patrol= Miami-Dade Shmira Patrol was founded in 2003 by Isaac (Yitzy) Rosenberg. Western United StatesLos Angeles Shmira= The Los Angeles Shmira Safety Patrol was founded in 2009 in the Pico/Robertson area of Los Angeles. After a slow start a former member of the Guardian Angels joined and helped revitalize the patrol. LA Shmira works closely with the Los Angeles Police Department's Olympic Division and coordinates with the South Robertson District Council's Safety Committee. LA Shmira currently has 4 dispatchers and 20 volunteer responders, including three Rabbis. United KingdomShomrim London, Stamford Hill= The Stamford Hill Shomrim, founded in 2008 by Efrayim Goldstein, has many volunteers and a 24-hour emergency hotline. Shomrim volunteers undergo training according to Security Industry Authority standards and are CRB checked prior to joining as a volunteer. Members receive ongoing training at Stoke Newington Police Station as for the London metropolitan police and are kept updated about new, targeted police operations in the area. In its first five months of operation, the hotline received 2,000 calls reporting burglaries, thefts, muggings, missing people etc. On average, Stamford Hill Shomrim receives approximately 4500 hotline calls a year; however, the members deal with incidents as and when they come across it too. Incoming calls are dispatched to local Shomrim volunteers via two-way radios. While police figures previously showed Stamford Hill to have the lowest crime rate in the borough of Hackney, the presence of Shomrim has revealed that crime was being underreported by the largely Yiddish-speaking Hasidic community. Stamford Hill Shomrim proactively patrol and operate in North & East London primarily but not exclusively, typically in the N16 E5 and N15 postcodes, generally referred to as Stamford Hill, Upper Clapton and South Tottenham, which includes these wards (wholly or partly) in Hackney & Haringey: Brownswood, Stoke Newington Central, Stamford Hill West, Woodbury Down (formerly Lordship & New River), Springfield, Cazenove, Leabridge, Hackney Downs, Seven Sisters and St. Ann's. On many occasions, especially during searches for High Risk Missing People, Stamford Hill Shomrim members would patrol out of these boundaries. Stamford Hill Shomrim is currently headed by three Trustees, a Discipline Committee and an Executive Committee elected by its members. Rabbi Kurt Stern MBE and Isaac Kornbluh who are both members of the Hackney Police Independent Advisory Group, act as liaisons between Shomrim and the police. In 2012, Joe Lobenstein MBE, formerly elected Mayor of Hackney on 4 consecutive elections, was appointed as President of Stamford Hill Shomrim. After Joe Lobenstein died on 28 June 2015, aged 88, Rabbi Herschel Gluck OBE was appointed as the new President of Stamford Hill Shomrim. Shomrim is registered with the Charity Commission and with Neighbourhood Watch as 'Community Safety Patrol'. In 2013, after the murder of the soldier Lee Rigby, and an increase in hate crimes against the wider Muslim community, Stamford Hill Shomrim offered to help the local Muslim community and keep a watchful eye on local mosques and Muslim community centres, which was gratefully welcomed by the North London Muslim community as stated by Eusoof Amerat, a Muslim community advocate in Hackney and commended by the Hackney Police Borough Commander. Shomrim also advised the North London Muslim Community Centre on security issues, according to centre chairman Munaf Zeena. Shomrim's offer to the Muslim community was included in the 2013 annual report on International Religious Freedom and recognised by the US Secretary of State John Kerry in his speech when publishing this report, saying \\"in London, an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood watch team helped Muslim leaders protect their mosque and prevent future attacks\\". He continued by saying \\"they will not receive prizes; they may not ever receive recognition. Their courage goes unremarked, but that makes it all the more remarkable . . . Believe me, that's the definition of courage\\". In November 2014, Ambassador Samantha Power mentioned Shomrim's offer in her speech at the 10th Anniversary of the OSCE's Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism, Stamford Hill Shomrim have on many occasions received public praise from the higher ranks, as on one occasion by Metropolitan Police Superintendent David Grainger after a successful double arrest for burglary on the vulnerable, and have been lauded by Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Stephen Greenhalgh. in June 2014 Stamford Hill Shomrim received a formal commendation award from the outgoing Hackney Police Borough Commander - Chief Superintendent Matthew Horne. and on 12 June 2015 Shomrim volunteers were publicly commended for their help in identifying two suspects who slashed tyres of lots of vehicles in Stamford Hill area. On 5 February 2015, Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey QPM attended a Shomrim event as guest of honour and spoke highly of the work Shomrim do. This event was also attended by the then Minister for Justice Simon Hughes MP. In August 2014, Stamford Hill Shomrim organised its first annual Community Engagement Event where an estimated six thousand people participated, for advice on crime prevention and bike marking. In July 2015 Shomrim held a similar event where Senior members of Scotland Yard's police force attended including the Deputy Mayor for Policing and Crime Stephen Greenhalgh and Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball alongside Hackney borough commander Chief Supt Simon Lawrence. This is now a planned annual event. As well as helping the community and Police with catching offenders and reducing general crime in the area, Shomrim were singled out for their help in bring offenders of anti-Semitic crime to justice, with the Hackney Police Borough Commander quoted as saying that 27% of anti-Semitic perpetrators in Hackney are caught and charged or cautioned and \\"Shomrim have played a huge part in that by alerting us of crimes and providing evidence to bring offenders to justice\\". =Shomrim London NW= Shomrim London North West Community Patrol operates in the London Borough of Barnet. It was founded by Gary Ost in 2008 as a registered charity which operates as \\"mobile neighborhood watch\\" and acts as eyes and ears to the local Community and the Metropolitan Police. Volunteer Patrol members patrol the streets of Golders Green, Childs Hill, Hendon, Finchley and Temple Fortune whereby members report crime to the Metropolitan Police. At least 2 vehicles patrol the area every night. Shomrim London NW operate a 24-hour emergency response team which will dispatch units to a scene of an emergency and will liaise with the other responding emergency services. Volunteers are in radio contact, and dispatched via a central dispatcher. Shomrim London NW has the capability to deal with various scenarios including the locating of missing persons and protocols are in place for full-scale searches with Stamford Hill Shomrim & North West London Shomrim working in partnership. All volunteers have completed training from the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command (SO15) in assisting to identify potential security threats and suspicious activity. The Jewish Rabbinate in London have thanked Shomrim London NW for the dedication of its volunteers and for providing a valuable service in enhancing the quality of life within the Jewish neighborhood. Shomrim London NW also acts as a liaison between the North West London community and the Metropolitan Police. Ost, chief executive of Shomrim North-West London feels that reporting rates have increased in Barnet due to Shomrim's presence there and their work became doubly important during the London riots in July 2011 On 4 July 2015, an anti-Shomrim protest organized by neo-Nazis was held at Whitehall. Jeremy Bedford Turner, one of the leading skinheads of the London Forum, was arrested for incitement to racial hatred following an antisemitic speech he made at the rally in which he called upon the protestors to \\"free England from Jewish control.\\" He was convicted in May 2018 and given a 6-month custodial sentence.

Its chairman was Muammar Gaddafi, who had the most influence. In 1977, the Libyan Arab Republic was abolished and Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya was established. As a part of this, the RCC was officially abolished and replaced by the general secretariat of the General People's Congress. Membership Gaddafi in 1976 The other initial members (1970) were as follows: *Maj. Abdessalam Jallud *Maj. Beshir al-Saghir Hawady *Maj. Mukthar Abdullah al-Gherwy *Capt. Abdul Moniem al-Taher el-Huny *Capt. Mustafa al-Kharouby *Maj. Khuwaildi al- Hamidi *Maj. Muhammad Nejm *Maj. Awad Ali Hamza *Maj. Abu-Bakr Yunis Jabr *Capt. Umar Muhayshi *Capt. Mohammed Abu Bakr Al-Magariaf History Setting up a new government, the 12 member central committee of the Free Unionist Officers converted themselves into a Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), which governed the newly established Libyan Arab Republic. Below them were formed a council of ministers, headed by Mahmud Sulayman al-Maghribi, to oversee the implementation of RCC policy. Captain Gaddafi was promoted to the rank of Colonel, and was recognized as both chairman of the RCC as well as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, becoming the de facto head of state. From 1970 to 1972, he also served as prime minister. Although the RCC was theoretically a collegial body that operated through discussion and consensus building, from the start it was dominated by the opinions and decisions of Gaddafi, although some of the others attempted to constrain what they saw as his excesses. Gaddafi remained the public face of the government, with the identities of the other RCC members only being publicly revealed in the Official Gazette on 10 January 1970. All of them were young men, from (typically rural) working and middle-class backgrounds, and none had university degrees; in this way they were all distinct from the wealthy, highly educated conservatives who had previously governed the country. The coup completed, the RCC proceeded with their intentions of consolidating the revolutionary government and modernising the country. Monarchists and members of Idris' Senussi clan were removed from Libya's political world and armed forces; Gaddafi believed that this elite were opposed to the will of the Libyan people and needed to be expunged. Many figures in the old regime were imprisoned, though none were executed. They maintained the previous administration's ban on political parties, and ruled by decree. Further restrictions were placed on the press, and in May 1970, trade unions were banned. After Libya was converted into the \\"(Great) Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\\" in 1977, the remaining members of the RCC formed the apex of the \\"revolutionary sector\\" that oversaw the government. They were not subject to election, since they held office by virtue of having led the 1969 coup-- officially described as \\"the Revolution.\\" As a result, although Gaddafi held no formal governmental post after 1979, he continued to have the most important role in the government of the country until his overthrow and execution in the Libyan Civil War in 2011.

Still, the intravascular component is usually of primary interest, and volume status is sometimes used synonymously with intravascular volume status. It is related to the patient's state of hydration, but is not identical to it. For instance, intravascular volume depletion can exist in an adequately hydrated person if there is loss of water into interstitial tissue (e.g. due to hyponatremia or liver failure). Clinical assessment=Intravascular Volume Depletion Volume contraction of intravascular fluid (blood plasma) is termed hypovolemia,MedicineNet > Definition of Hypovolemia Retrieved on July 2, 2009TheFreeDictionary.com --> hypovolemia Citing Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. Retrieved on July 2, 2009 and its signs include, in order of severity: * a fast pulse * infrequent and low volume urination * dry mucous membranes (e.g. a dry tongue) * poor capillary refill (e.g. when the patient's fingertip is pressed, the skin turns white, but upon release, the skin does not return to pink as fast as it should - usually >2 seconds) * decreased skin turgor (e.g. the skin remains \\"tented\\" when it is pinched) * a weak pulse * orthostatic hypotension (dizziness upon standing up from a seated or reclining position, due to a drop in cerebral blood pressure) * orthostatic increase in pulse rate * cool extremities (e.g. cool fingers) Intravascular volume overload Signs of intravascular volume overload (high blood volume) include: * an elevated Jugular venous pressure (JVP) Intravascular Blood Volume Correlation to a Patient's Ideal Height and Weight For the clinical assessment of intravascular blood volume, the BVA-100, a semi-automated blood volume analyzer device that has FDA approval, determines the status of a patient‚Äôs blood volume based on the Ideal Height and Weight Method. Using a patient‚Äôs ideal weight and actual weight, the percent deviation from the desirable weight is found using the following equation: \\\\pm\\\\%\\\\text{ Desirable Weight} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Actual Weight}-\\\\text{Desirable Weight}}{\\\\text{Desirable Weight}}\\\\times100 Using the deviation from desirable weight, the BV ratio (ml/kg), i.e. Ideal Blood Volume, can be determined. The machine was tested in clinical studies for the treatment of a broad range of medical conditions related to Intravascular Volume Status, such as anemia, congestive heart failure, sepsis, CFS, Hyponatremia, Syncope and more. This tool for measuring blood volume may foster improved patient care as both a stand-alone and complementary diagnostic tool as there has been a statistically significant increase in patient survival. Pathophysiology=Intravascular volume depletion The most common cause of hypovolemia is diarrhea or vomiting. The other causes are usually divided into renal and extrarenal causes. Renal causes include overuse of diuretics, or trauma or disease of the kidney. Extrarenal causes include bleeding, burns, and any causes of edema (e.g. congestive heart failure, liver failure). Intravascular volume depletion is divided into three types based on the blood sodium level: #Isonatremic (normal blood sodium levels) Example: a child with diarrhea, because both water and sodium are lost in diarrhea. #Hyponatremic (abnormally low blood sodium levels). Example: a child with diarrhea who has been given tap water to replete diarrheal losses. Overall there is more water than sodium in the body. The intravascular volume is low because the water will move through a process called osmosis out of the vasculature into the cells (intracellularly). The danger is tissue swelling (edema) the most important being brain edema which in turn will cause more vomiting. #Hypernatremic (abnormally high blood sodium levels). Example: a child with diarrhea who has been given salty soup to drink, or insufficiently diluted infant formula. Overall there is more sodium than water. The water will move out of the cell toward the intravascular compartment down the osmotic gradient. This can cause tissue breakage (in case of muscle breakage it is called rhabdomyolysis). Intravascular volume overload Intravascular volume overload can occur during surgery, if water rather than isotonic saline is used to wash the incision. It can also occur if there is inadequate urination, e.g. with certain kidney diseases.

Geography = Location  Kleinwallstadt lies in the Bavarian Lower Main (Bayerischer Untermain) Region. The community has the following Gemarkungen (traditional rural cadastral areas): Hofstetten, Kleinwallstadt.  History  Kleinwallstadt was already settled quite early on. Archaeological finds from Hallstatt times bear witness to the prehistoric settlers. At a find in 1980, not only were some female skeletal remains unearthed, but also some lovely grave goods from Alamannic times (4th-5th century). In Kleinwallstadt, then also known as Bischofswallstadt, which was converted to Christianity as early as the early 8th century, the Archbishop of Mainz established in 1023 a Vogtei and a tithe court over a great expanse of the Spessart (range). In the 12th and early 13th century, the Lords of Waldenberg were enfeoffed with the place. About 1185 they built a castle on a crag east of the community, but this had already been destroyed by the mid 13th century. (The remains of the Altes Schloss were explored by archaeologists in 2006 and 2007). From the 16th century, the Focke von Wallstadt family were resident in the community. Their seat, the ‚ÄúIngelheimer Hof‚Äù next to the town hall, and all appurtenances passed in 1587 to the Echter von Mespelbrunn family, and thereafter to the Imperial Counts (Reichsgrafen) of Ingelheim. Under Archbishop Johann Schweikhard von Kronberg in 1611, 84 witches were put to death in Kleinwallstadt. Since the Thirty Years' War had wrought such devastation upon Kleinwallstadt and all records and documents had been destroyed, the Archbishop of Mainz issued new guild charters in 1733 for Kleinwallstadt and the surrounding villages. It can be inferred from these that earlier on in Kleinwallstadt and the surrounding area, quite a lively commercial life had taken hold, for the charters number 17 occupations, such as cooper, brewer, carpenter, mason, potter, dyer, glazier, stocking weaver and linen weaver. On the same grounds, the market rights, which had surely been granted earlier, were newly confirmed and chartered in 1737 by the Elector of Mainz. The Electoral Mainz Vogteiamt of Kleinwallstadt passed with the 1803 Reichsdeputationshauptschluss to the newly formed Principality of Aschaffenburg, with which it passed in 1814 (by this time it had become a department of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt) to Bavaria. File:Kleinwallstadt Bahnhof.JPGRailway station File:Kleinwallstadt Rathaus.JPGTown Hall File:Kleinwallstadt Kirche.JPGChurch File:Kleinwallstadt Hauptstra√üe im Winter.JPGMain street  Population development  Within town limits, 4,778 inhabitants were counted in 1970, 4,876 in 1987 and in 2000 5,650.  Politics = Mayors  The mayor is Thomas K√∂hler (CSU). In 2002 he succeeded Karl Heinz Bein (SPD). Thomas K√∂hler was confirmed in office in 2008 for a further six years.  Community council  The council is made up of 20 council members with seats apportioned thus (2008‚Äì2014 term): *CSU 10 seats *SPD 5 seats *Freie W√§hler 4 seats *B√ºndnis 90/Die Gr√ºnen 1 seat Municipal taxes in 1999 amounted to ‚Ç¨2,978,000 (converted), of which net business taxes amounted to ‚Ç¨721,000.  Coat of arms  The community's arms might be described thus: Argent a Roman watchtower with a tent roof gules, in chief dexter an inescutcheon party per pale argent and sable with a bend sinister counterchanged, in chief sinister an inescutcheon of the second with a wheel spoked of six of the first. The watchtower is a reference to the Limes Germanicus, built by the Roman Emperor Hadrian (117-138), which once ran along the river Main between Kleinwallstadt and the town across the river, Gro√üwallstadt (klein and gro√ü are German for ‚Äúlittle‚Äù and ‚Äúgreat‚Äù respectively). The inescutcheon on the dexter (armsbearer's right, viewer's left) side is the Focke von Wallstadt family's arms, and the one on the sinister (armsbearer's left, viewer's right) side is charged with the Wheel of Mainz, and refers to the community's long history as an Electoral Mainz holding, lasting until the Old Empire's downfall in 1803. The tinctures argent and gules (silver and red) also refer to Mainz's former overlordship. The arms have been borne since 1955.Description and explanation of Kleinwallstadt‚Äôs arms  Economy and infrastructure  According to official statistics, there were 6 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls working in agriculture and forestry in 1998. In producing businesses this was 606, and in trade and transport 176. In other areas, 366 workers on the social welfare contribution rolls were employed, and 1,879 such workers worked from home. There were 10 processing businesses. Five businesses were in construction, and furthermore, in 1999, there were 18 agricultural operations with a working area of 311 ha, of which 204 ha was cropland and 99 ha was meadowland.

Often incorrectly thought of as one of the longest tunnels in the world, the aqueduct's tunnel section is not continuous. The aqueduct was built to carry approximately per day of water from Thirlmere Reservoir to Manchester. The construction of the reservoir and aqueduct was authorised by the Manchester Waterworks Act of Parliament. The first phase was completed in 1897 and, for the pipeline sections, subsequent phases were completed in 1925. The first water to arrive in Manchester from the Lake District was marked with an official ceremony on 13 October 1894. History Thirlmere In 1874 John Frederick Bateman advised Manchester Corporation that the increasing demand for water, then averaging per day, would soon exhaust the available supply from Longdendale. His first recommendation was to source water from Ullswater, but it was eventually decided to seek powers to acquire Thirlmere and build a dam there.

Notable people Northern Ohio had settlers mostly from the Northeast, many of whom supported abolition of slavery before the Civil War. One of the notable natives of Bristolville is John Henrie Kagi, who fought with John Brown in Bleeding Kansas before its admission to the Union.

The German lepidopterist Hans Fruhstorfer wrote: \\"In this magnificent tropical genus, upon which nature seems to have showered all her abundance of most brilliant colours, and which is, therefore, justly called the 'princely race' of the Nymphalidae, we are most surprised to meet a repetition of two genera of not less abundant colours: the Callithea and Catagramma, except that the Agrias species greatly excel the latter in size and magnificent colours, and only the males of this genus bear a sexual distinction in the shape of a hair-brush on the hindwings. Some of them, like the famous A. sardanapalus, having been first discovered by Bates in the Amazon Valley, are of an absolutely charming beauty, and the contrast of its purple-red forewings beaming through a blue lustre hued over them as if in a violet purple gloss, with the brilliantly sapphire-blue hindwings, is undoubtedly one of the most magnificent sights that nature has ever produced in the whole world of butterflies.\\"Fruhstorfer, H. (1913). Family: Morphidae. In A. Seitz (editor), Macrolepidoptera of the World, vol. 5: 333‚Äì356. Stuttgart: Alfred Kernen. Prized by collectors, these large, showy butterflies have had hundreds of names applied to polymorphic variants. Description left left The species of the genus Agrias have, variously, very bright red, orange, iridescent blue and yellow colouration contrasting on the black or bluish background of their upperside wing. The underside wings are patterned. They have a robust appearance (broad thorax and short wide abdomen) allowing fast flight. The wingspan is 70‚Äì120 mm. Males of all Agrias species have prominent yellow tufts of androconial scales on the hindwings. These disperse pheromones for attracting suitable mates. Biology Adult Agrias live in the forest canopy, occasionally visiting the forest floor to feed on decomposing fruit. The butterflies always feed and rest with their wings closed, but if disturbed they may give a rapid flick of the wings, displaying the vivid colours of the upperside. Males establish territories and perch on tree trunks, branches, and even the ground. Agrias larvae feed on Erythroxylum. The smooth and round eggs are laid singly on the leaves of the food plant. The larvae are pale brownish, marked with lichen-green spots, have recurved \\"horns\\" on the head capsule and a bifid tail. They feed at night and spend the day on twigs. The pupa is pale green. It has a dorsal hump, and tapers sharply toward a stout cremaster and the bifid head. It is suspended from a stem or leaf of the food plant. Rio Huallaga, Peru Habitat Agrias are found in both lowland and montane tropical wet forests. Adults of Agrias amydon are also found in pasture habitats in the wet season but probably pass most, or all, of the long dry season in forest refugia. During the dry season, strong- flying A. amydon undoubtedly forage in open areas, only to return to sheltered retreats in response to thermal stress. Mimicry Agrias phalcidon is a Mullerian mimic with the Asterope (formerly Callithea) species complex. Systematics Clade showing phylogenetics of Agrias. Hybrids *Prepona √ó sarumani was described by Paul Smart in 1976 is considered to be a hybrid between Prepona praeneste abrupta and Agrias claudina lugens. Intergeneric hybrids are rare and this may indicate Prepona is very closely related to Agrias or that the genera should be combined.

Authoring systems can be defined as software that allows its user to create multimedia applications for manipulating multimedia objects. In the development of educational software, an authoring system is a program that allows a non-programmer, usually an instructional designer or technologist, to easily create software with programming features. The programming features are built in but hidden behind buttons and other tools, so the author does not need to know how to program. Generally authoring systems provide many graphics, much interaction, and other tools educational software needs. The three main components of an authoring system are: content organization, control of content delivery, and type(s) of assessment. Content Organization allows the user to structure and sequence the instructional content and media. Control of content delivery refers to the ability for the user to set the pace in which the content is delivered, and how learners engage with the content. Assessment refers to the ability to test learning outcomes within the system, usually in the form of tests, discussions, assignments, and other activities which can be evaluated. An authoring system usually includes an authoring language, a programming language built (or extended) with functionality for representing the tutoring system. The functionality offered by the authoring language may be programming functionality for use by programmers or domain representation functionality for use by subject experts. There is overlap between authoring languages with domain representation functionality and domain-specific languages. Authoring language An authoring language is a programming language used to create tutorials, computer-based training courseware, websites, CD-ROMs and other interactive computer programs.

History Duncan Falls is named for an early hunter and trapper by the name of Major Duncan, who emigrated from Virginia and settled near a falls on the Muskingum River, approximately nine miles south of present-day Zanesville, in the 1790s. He reportedly skirmished with the local Shawnee over his traps, and according to legend was killed by the Shawnee while attempting to cross the river at the falls. Thus, his name became associated with these falls. Other, more mundane explanations for the origin of the town's name also exist. The settlement of the town, initially known as Duncan's Falls, began with the establishment of a store by James Taylor in 1825. Alanson Holderidge and Justice Depew, both erected blacksmith shops around 1828. A tavern was established by Jacob Hall in 1830. James Taylor established a ferry across the Muskingum River at the falls in 1830. Although the county history by Everhart states that a free bridge was constructed across the river by the county government in 1831, the Zanesville Signal reported that the first bridge across the river did not arrive until 1875. James Taylor built a dam at the falls in 1832 to entice millers to settle in the town, and in 1835 the state government improved the dam. In 1838, a four-story flour mill was erected by Lewis Dugan and William Bowen. As the area around the falls was now starting to develop, James Taylor formally platted a townsite in 1841 (Taylor had previously platted Taylorsville, now known as Philo, on the other side of the river in 1833). By the 1840s, the dam and lock system was in place, allowing for steamboat travel, but raising the water level of the river so as to hide the falls. As of 1882, the town had around 200 inhabitants, including one physician, a Dr. Mason.Everhart, J.F. History of Muskingum County, Ohio, with Illustrations and Biographical Sketches of Prominent Men and Pioneers. J.F. Everhart & Co., Columbus, OH, 1882. Around 1890, an order from the U.S. Postal Service changed the name from Duncan's Falls to Duncan Falls.Zanesville Signal, Mar 9, 1958, p.15. In 1896, the original flour mill burned to the ground. It was rebuilt in 1898, and burned again in 1902, and was again rebuilt. The mill was purchased in 1922 by the Ohio Power Company, to acquire its water rights on the river. Ohio Power tore the mill down. Much of the town was damaged by a severe flood of the Muskingum River in 1913. By the 1920s, steamboat commerce on the river was dying down. The completion of the Philo Power Plant across the river in Philo in 1924 provided a much needed economic lifeline to Duncan Falls, which was furthered by the completion of the Ohio Ferro Alloys Corporation factory in Philo in 1927. The road along the east side of the Muskingum River through Duncan Falls was fully paved in 1933, bringing much highway traffic between Zanesville and Marietta through Duncan Falls (this traffic had previously traveled on a paved route further east that passed through Chandlersville and Caldwell).

The main missions of LULI include: (i) Research in Plasma Physics, (ii) Development and operation of high-power high-energy lasers and experimental facilities, (iii) student formation in Plasma Physics, Optics and Laser Physics. Research in Plasma Physics Focusing the extreme power of pulsed lasers (up to the petawatt level, 1015W) onto tiny spots, Œºm to mm in diameter, leads to ultrahigh intensities reaching today 1020W/cm2 or more. Targets irradiated at such intensities can reach temperatures of the order of hundred million degrees and pressures of tens of megabars. Moreover, the electric and magnetic fields associated with the laser beam itself or the fields produced in the plasma are responsible for the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies and to the production of intense radiation from THz to x-rays and Œ≥-rays. The main subjects studied by LULI's scientists include laser inertial fusion and all its physical components (e.g. laser- plasma interaction), fundamental physics of hot and dense plasmas and its applications in astrophysics and geophysics. In the short-pulse picosecond regime, the main developments concern the fast-igniter scheme for inertial fusion, and the production of brief and intense sources of radiation and relativistic particles. National and International Facility LULI is the French national civilian facility dedicated to research using high-energy high-power lasers and their applications. French and foreign users have access to the two most energetic French academic laser chains: 100TW and LULI2000. The main beam of the 100TW facility delivers 30 J in 300 fs at 1.06 Œºm. It is coupled with additional nanosecond and picosecond beams. Nano2000, the nanosecond version of LULI2000 consists in two laser beams delivering each 1 kJ in nanosecond pulses at 1.06 Œºm. PICO2000 couples one of these nanosecond beams with a 200 J picosecond beam. Each of these facilities is coupled to a dedicated experimental area. The development of the laser sources is supported by an important R&D; programme in high-power laser related optics and laser technology.

It meets SIL 3 of IEC 61508 and Category 4 of EN 954-1 or Performance Level \\"e\\" of the successor standard EN 13849-1.  Origin  SafetyBUS p was developed by Pilz GmbH & Co. KG between 1995 and 1999. The objective was to provide a fieldbus for data communication in terms of machinery safety . Since 1999 the technology of SafetyBUS p has been managed by the user organisation Safety Network International e.V. (formally SafetyBUS p Club International e.V.), whose members work on the further development of SafetyBUS p.  Application  The main application of SafetyBUS p lies in the communication of data with safety-related content. SafetyBUS p can be used anywhere that communicated data has to be consistent in terms of time and content, in order to safeguard against danger. This danger may concern hazards to life and limb, but may also involve the protection of economic assets. Typical application areas are: * Factory automation (e.g. car production, presses) * Transport technology (e.g. cable cars, fairground rides) SafetyBUS p can be used on applications with safety-related requirements up to SIL 3 of IEC 61508 or Cat. 4 of EN 954-1.  Technology  Technically, SafetyBUS p is based on the fieldbus system CAN. In addition to OSI Layers 1 and 2, which are already defined in CAN for bit rate and security, SafetyBUS p adds additional mechanisms to safeguard transmission in Layers 2 and 7.  Fault mechanisms  The following mechanisms are used on SafetyBUS p to detect transmission errors and device errors: * Sequential numbers * Timeout * Echo * ID for transmitter and receiver * Data security (CRC)  Technical details  The SafetyBUS p frame data, as determined by the technology, is as follows: * Maximum 64 bus subscribers per network * Up to 4000 I/O points per network * Transmission rates 20 to 500 kbit/s, depending on the network extension * Individual network segments can extend to up to 3500 m * Multiple network segments can be connected * Guaranteed error reaction times of up to 20 ms can be achieved * Suitable for applications in accordance with SIL 3 of IEC 61508 and Cat. 4 of EN 954-1 * Option to supply voltage to the devices via the bus cable * Subnetworks can be implemented in wireless technology, with fibre- optic cables and as an infrared connection.  Devices  Only safety- related devices are used in SafetyBUS p networks. In general these are designed to be multi-channel internally. Safety-related use of the devices normally requires safety to be certified by authorised testing laboratories, who test the devices in accordance with the applicable standards and provisions. A functional inspection is carried out by the user organisation Safety Network International e.V.  Organisation  The user organisation SafetyBUS p Club International e.V. combines manufacturers and users of SafetyBUS p and has been in existence since 1999. In 2006 the organisation was renamed Safety Network International e.V. In addition to the international organisation there are also two other regional organisations: Japan was established in 2000, while USA was established in 2001. The organisation continues to develop the system, resulting in its successor, SafetyNET p.  Literature  * Winfried Gr√§f: Maschinensicherheit. H√ºthig GmbH & Co.

This is caused by a nearby transmitter with a strong signal on a close frequency, which overloads the receiver and makes it unable to fully receive the desired signal.https://www.radio-electronics.com/info/rf- technology-design/receiver-overload/blocking.php Typical receiver operation is such that the Minimum Detectable Signal (MDS) level is determined by the thermal noise of its electronic components. When a signal is received, additional spurious signals are produced within the receiver because it is not truly a linear device. When these spurious signals have a power level that is less than the thermal noise power level, then the receiver is operating normally. When these spurious signals have a power level that is higher than the thermal noise floor, then the receiver is desensitized. This is because the MDS has risen due to the level of the spurious signals. Spurious signals increase in level when the received signal strength increases. When an interfering signal is present, it can contribute to the level of the spurious signals. Stronger interference generates stronger spurious signals. The interference may be at a different frequency than the signal of interest, but the spurious signals caused by that interference can show up at the same frequency as the signal of interest. It is these spurious signals that degrade the ability of the receiver by raising the MDS. Consider the case of a repeater station, a station consisting of a transmitter and receiver, both operating at the same time, but on separate frequencies, and in some cases, separate antennas. Elevated MDS can be experienced in this case as well. One way to correct this condition is adding a duplexer to the station. This is common in Land Mobile Radio services such as police, fire, various commercial and amateur service.

In pharmacology, drug desensitization refers to two related concepts. First, desensitization may be equivalent to drug tolerance and refers to subjects' reactions (positive or negative) to a drug reducing following its repeated use. This is a macroscopic, organism-level effect and differs from the second meaning of desensitization, which refers to a biochemical effect where individual receptors become less responsive after repeated application of an agonist. This may be mediated by phosphorylation, for instance by beta adrenoceptor kinase at the beta adrenoceptor. Application to allergies For example, if a person with diabetes mellitus has a bad allergic reaction to taking a full dose of beef insulin, the person is given a very small amount of the insulin at first, so small that the person has no adverse reaction or very limited symptoms as a result. Over a period of time, larger doses are given until the person is taking the full dose. This is one way to help the body get used to the full dose, and to avoid having the allergic reaction to beef-origin insulin. A temporary desensitization method involves the administration of small doses of an allergen to produces an IgE-mediated response in a setting where an individual can be resuscitated in the event of anaphylaxis; this approach, through uncharacterized mechanisms, eventually overrides the hypersensitive IgE response. Desensitization approaches for food allergies are generally at the research stage. They include: * oral immunotherapy, which involves building up tolerance by eating a small amount of (usually baked) food; * sublingual immunotherapy, which involves placing a small drop of milk or egg white under the tongue; * epicutaneous immunotherapy, which injects the allergic food under the skin; * monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies, which non- specifically reduce the body's capacity to produce an allergic reaction; * a Chinese herbal formulation, FAHF-2, another non-specific approach currently being studied in peanut allergy; * use of probiotics; * helminthic therapy; * a drug to suppress toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9); and * mepolizumab to treat eosinophilic esophagitis.

Desensitization also occurs when an emotional response is repeatedly evoked in situations in which the action tendency that is associated with the emotion proves irrelevant or unnecessary. The process of desensitization was developed by psychologist Mary Cover Jones, and is primarily used to assist individuals in unlearning phobias and anxieties.T.L. Brink (2008) Psychology: A Student Friendly Approach. \\"Unit 6: Learning.\\" pp. 101 Joseph Wolpe (1958) developed a method of a hierarchal list of anxiety evoking stimuli in order of intensity, which allows individuals to undergo adaption. Although medication is available for individuals suffering from anxiety, fear or phobias, empirical evidence supports desensitization with high rates of cure, particularly in clients suffering from depression or schizophrenia.  Steps  The hierarchical list is constructed between client and therapist in rank ordered series of steps from the least disturbing to the most disturbing fears or phobias. Secondly the client is taught techniques that produce deep relaxation. It is impossible to feel both anxiety and relaxation at the same time, so easing the client into deep relaxation helps inhibit any feelings of anxiety. Systematic desensitization (a guided reduction in fear, anxiety or aversion) can then be achieved by gradually approaching the feared stimulus while maintaining relaxation. Desensitization works best when individuals are directly exposed to the stimuli and situations they fear so anxiety-evoking stimuli are paired with inhibitory responses. This is carried out either by clients performing in real life situations (known as vivo desensitization), or, if it is not practical to directly act out the steps of hierarchy, by clients observing models performing the feared behaviour (known as vicarious desensitization). Clients slowly move up the hierarchy, repeating performances if necessary, until the last item on the list is performed without fear or anxiety.  Effects on animals  Horses have a natural fear of unpredictable movement. Pictured is a horse being desensitized to accept the fluttering skirt of a lady's riding habit. Animals can also be desensitized to their rational or irrational fears. A race horse who fears the starting gate can be desensitized to the fearful elements (the creak of the gate, the starting bell, the enclosed space) one at a time, in small doses or at a distance. Clay et al. (2009) conducted an experiment whereby he allocated rhesus macaques to either a desensitization group or a control group, finding that those in the desensitization group showed a significant reduction in both the rate and duration of fearful behavior. This supports the use of PRT training. Desensitization is commonly used with simple phobias like insect phobia. In addition, desensitization therapy has been shown to be a useful tool in training domesticated dogs. Systematic desensitization used in conjunction with counter-conditioning was shown to reduce problem behaviours in dogs, such as vocalization and property destruction.  Effects on violence  Desensitization also refers to the potential for reduced responsiveness to actual violence caused by exposure to violence in the media, although this topic is debated in the scientific literature on the topic. Desensitization may arise from different sources of media, including TV, video games and movies. Some scholars suggest that violence may prime thoughts of hostility, with the possibility of affecting the way we perceive others and interpret their actions. It is hypothesized that initial exposure to violence in the media may produce a number of aversive responses such as increased heart rate, fear, discomfort, perspiration and disgust. However, prolonged and repeated exposure to violence in the media may reduce or habituate the initial psychological impact until violent images do not elicit these negative responses. Eventually the observer may become emotionally and cognitively desensitized to media violence. In one experiment, participants who played violent video games showed lower heart rate and galvanic skin response readings, which the authors interpreted as displaying a physiological desensitization to violence. However, other studies have failed to replicate this finding. Some scholars have questioned whether becoming desensitized to media violence specifically transfers to becoming desensitized to real-life violence.

A member of the Manitoba Major Junior Hockey League (MMJHL), the Twisters play their home games at Morris Multiplex. History The Pembina Valley Twisters first skated into existence in September 2001, founded by Glenn Cordy and Kerry Lines. Glenn and Kerry coached the Sanford Sabers High School Hockey Team during the 2000-01 season. At the conclusion of an emotional season it was realized that the graduating players did not have a place to continue playing outside the \\"Winkler Flyers\\" and a Junior B team in St. Malo, Manitoba. Thus the founding of the team in 2001. The first four years were played in Oak Bluff. The first coach was Danny McDonald. The third and fourth years were led by Rick Smith and his coaching staff. During both seasons, the Twisters competed and made the playoffs. Concluding the fourth season, as was the case with Danny McDonald, Rick Smith stepped down as head coach. Rick's efforts did not go unnoticed as the Twisters were now on the verge of taking the next step, competing for a league championship. After our fourth season Glen Munford contacted Kerry Lines inquiring about an expansion franchise for Morris. That was not possible, as sharing the existing geographic area would not work. The other possibility was proposed, moving the Twisters to the Town of Morris. After several discussions and after partaking in the Stampede Parade, it was unanimously decided to move the franchise to Morris. The existing ownership group of Kerry, Don Boyd and Doug Ushakas now joined Glen Munford and Dale Rempel to make up the new ownership group. The Twisters entered the fifth year with Doug Ushakas behind the bench as head coach. The previous two seasons were as an assistant to Rick Smith. After an off season recruiting program, the Twisters were eliminated during the first round of playoffs.

There have been rumors that the name has a connection to the German movie Der blaue Engel, but this has never been confirmed. The class DE-1 DMUs were single car DMUs, while the DE-2s had two (articulated) carriages. They were extensively used on the branch lines in Friesland as well as on other non-electrified secondary routes. They also operated the Maastricht-Liege shuttle. Originally painted blue (hence the nickname), they were later repainted dark red. They were largely replaced by new Wadloper DMUs in the 1980s. 26 DE-2s were refurbished from 1975 to 1981 and repainted into yellow NS livery, but the DE-1s retained the dark red livery until withdrawal. A NS DE-2 stored away at a depot in Simpelveld, the Netherlands Description These streamlined DEMUs were built by Allan of Rotterdam in 1953-54 for Nederlandse Spoorwegen. 30 1-car DE-1 units (numbered 21-50) and 46 2-car DE-2 units (numbered 61-106) were built. The DE-1 contained only two compartments, smoking and non-smoking. There was no separate 1st class compartment; instead, eight seats in the non-smoking compartment were designated 1st class and fitted with different seat covers. Mechanically related to the class is the single-car DE-20, nicknamed The Camel (in Dutch: De Kameel), an inspection vehicle built in 1954, later hired out as an excursion train. The body shape of the units is derived from the NS Mat 46. The DE-1 is 27.05m long and has two bogies, each powered by two electric motors. The DE-2 is 45.4m long and the two cars are articulated, with three bogies in total. The first and third are each powered by two electric motors, with the middle bogie being an articulated Jacobs bogie. Power is provided by two diesel engines (originally manufactured by AEC), with each engine driving one bogie. The diesel engines on the DE-2 were replaced with more powerful motors in the 1950s. The wheelbase of each bogie is 3.0m, and the center-to- center distance of the bogies is 18.35m. The sets are equipped with Scharfenberg couplers, and up to three units can be coupled together for multiple working. The units were delivered in a light blue color with orange lining and provided with wings under the cab windows, leading to the Blue Angel nickname. In the 1960s, the units were repainted into red livery that was then standard for all diesel trainsets owned by Nederlandse Spoorwegen. Modernisation The first DE-2 unit, number 88, was refurbished by Hoofdwerkplaats Haarlem in 1975, and a further 25 DE-2 units were refurbished between 1977 and 1981. The changes included more spacious cabs, new interiors with read seating, a small first-class compartment, automatic doors, the removal of steps between the doors and the passenger seating, sliding windows to replace the crank-operated opening windows, and new diesel engines with a cooling system on the roof above each set of doors. The refurbished units were delivered in the standard Nederlandse Spoorwegen yellow livery. The refurbished units were renumbered 161-186. Due to significant differences in the conversion, prototype refurbished unit 161 was removed from service in 1984, and scrapped in 1988. Operations The DE-1 and DE-2 units could be seen on almost all non-electrified railway lines in the Netherlands. In many cases, the trainsets were used to replace steam locomotives. The first trainsets entered service in 1953 on the Arnhem -- Winterswijk, Gouda -- Alphen aan den Rijn, and Leeuwarden -- Sneek routes. The Groningen -- Delfzijl and Groningen -- Roodeschool routes followed in the same year, and in 1954 the units were placed on the Kamperlijntje, Zwolle -- Almelo line, and other non- electrified routes in Groningen, Friesland, and South Limburg. The units could also be found on international services between Maastricht and Liege, and between Heerlen and Aachen. Electrification between Gouda and Alphen aan den Rijn in 1956 resulted in the removal of these units from that route. In the early 1960s, the newly introduced DE-3 units replaced the DE-1 and DE-2 units on the Groningen -- Leeuwarden and Arnhem -- Winterswijk routes, with the displaced units mainly being used in Twente and around Zutphen. For a short time in the 1960s, the units were in service between Alkmaar and Hoorn, and from 1970 until the electrification of the line between Geldermalsen and Tiel in 1978, the units ran through services between Utrecht, Geldermalsen, Arnhem, and Nijmegen; after electrification, this route was cut back to Tiel. The units were removed from service between Maastricht and Aachen in 1977. Between 1981 and 1983, services on the northern branches in the provinces of Groningen and Friesland were taken over by the new Wadloper units, with all unrefurbished units being taken out of service by 1985. The refurbished DE-2 units were mainly used on unelectrified routes around Zwolle and Zutphen, and between Arnhem and Tiel. Eletrification of the Maastricht -- Liege route in 1985 resulted in the removal of units from international service. In 1988, the units were removed from service in South Limburg, although they returned to service between Maastricht and Aachen in December 1988. The service was cut back to Heerlen -- Aachen in May 1992, before finally being replaced in August 1998 by the new DM 90 stock. The final two DE-2 units in service, 180 and 186, were used by Oostnet and Syntus from 1998 and 2002, running between Almelo and Marienberg. Withdrawal The first DE-1 units were taken out of service in 1979, following the introduction of the new diesel-hydraulic Wadloper units. Most DE-1 units followed in the early 1980s, with units 21, 22, 25, 33, 34, 36, and 41 being kept in service until the mid-1980s due to rolling stock shortages, with the final units being retired in 1984 and 1985. Some DE-2 units were scrapped following accidents during their lifetime. The 20 unrefurbished units were retired by 1986, along with the prototype refurbished unit 161 in 1984. Unit 169 was taken out of service in 1995 following an accident, and most remaining units were taken out of service in 1997. Units 171, 178, and 179 remained in service with NS until 1998 for services in South Limburg. The final NS-operated units were taken out of service on August 14, 1998. Units 180 and 186 remained in service with Oostnet and Syntus from 1998 and 2002, with unit 164 retained as a source of spares. Unit 180 was withdrawn in April 2001 following an engine fire. Unit 186 was initially withdrawn in May 2001 with mechanical defects, but returned to service in September of that year; it was finally withdrawn on June 1, 2002. All three of the Syntus units have been preserved. Preservation DM-1s 20 and 41 are both preserved in working order at the Dutch Railway Museum in Utrecht. The cab of DM-1 21 is preserved by Stichting Stadskanaal Rail. DM-2 186 is preserved in working condition by the Stitchting Historisch Streekvervoer Achterhoek. Unit 179 is preserved in non-operational condition at the Zuid-Limburgse Stoomtrein Maatschappij. Unit 180 has been purchased by Rail Pleasure for use as a waiting area at their Twekkelo rail bicycle location. The ABk carriage from set 164 is in use as a holiday rental in Hoogwoud, with the cab of the Bk carriage preserved at the same location. The cab of the ABk carriage of number 169 has also been preserved by a private individual.

History = Pre-Colonial Period  The Banaue Rice Terraces Even before the colonization by the Spaniards in the Philippine islands, the natives of the archipelago already had practices linked to science and technology. Filipinos were already aware of the medicinal and therapeutic properties of plants and the methods of extracting medicine from herbs. They already had an alphabet, number system, a weighing and measuring system and a calendar. Filipinos were already engaged in farming, shipbuilding, mining and weaving. The Laguna Copperplate Inscription shows the use of mathematics in precolonial Philippine societies. A standard system of weights and measures is demonstrated by the use of precise measurement for gold, and familiarity with rudimentary astronomy is shown by fixing the precise day within the month in relation to the phases of the moon. Shipbuilding showed geometric thinking and mastery of convexity, concavity, and the proper proportion between ship breadth and length to ensure sailing efficiency. The practice of constructing as much as twelve ships and boats to fit inside each other, not unlike matryoshka dolls containing each other, can be interpreted as large three- dimensional wooden demonstration of sets, subsets, volumes, and ordinality.Mathematical Ideas in Early Philippine Society The Banaue Rice Terraces are among the sophisticated products of engineering by pre-Spanish era Filipinos.  Spanish Colonial Period  The colonization of the Philippines contributed to growth of science and technology in the archipelago. The Spanish introduced formal education and founded scientific institution. During the early years of Spanish rule in the Philippines. Parish schools were established where religion, reading, writing, arithmetic and music was taught. Sanitation and more advanced methods of agriculture was taught to the natives. Later the Spanish established colleges and universities in the archipelago including the University of Santo Tomas. Accounts by Spanish friars in the 1580s showed that astronomy was already known and practiced. The accounts also give the local names of constellations, such as Moroporo for the Pleiades and Balatik for Ursa Major among others. In 1687, Isaac Newton included an explicit reference to the Philippines in his classic Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica by mentioning Leuconia, the ancient Ptolemaic name for the Philippines. The study of medicine in the Philippines was given priority in the Spanish era, especially in the later years. The Spanish also contributed to the field of engineering in the islands by constructing government buildings, churches, roads, bridges and forts. Biology is given focus. Contributors to science in the archipelago during the 19th century were botanists, Fr. Ignacio Mercado., Dr. Trinidad Pardo de Tavera and Dr. Leon Ma Guerrero, chemist Anaclento del Rosario, and medicine scholars Dr. Manuel Guerrero, Dr, Jose Montes and Dr. Elrodario Mercado. The Galleon Trade have accounted in the Philippine colonial economy. Trade was given more focus by the Spaniard colonial authorities due to the prospects of big profits. Agriculture and industrial development on the other hand were relatively neglected. The opening of the Suez Canal saw the influx of European visitors to the Spanish colony and some Filipinos were able to study in Europe who were probably influenced by the rapid development of scientific ideals brought by the Age of Enlightenment.  American Period and Post-Commonwealth era  Angel Alcala is a national scientist noted for his work in marine and aquatic biology. The progress of science and technology in the Philippines continued under American rule. On July 1, 1901 The Philippine Commission established the Bureau of Government Laboratories which was placed under the Department of Interior. The Bureau replaced the Laboratorio Municipal, which was established under the Spanish colonial era. The Bureau dealt with the study of tropical diseases and laboratory projects. On October 26, 1905, the Bureau of Government Laboratories was replaced by the and on December 8, 1933, the National Research Council of the Philippines was established. The Bureau of Science became the primary research center of the Philippines until World War II. Science during the American period was inclined towards agriculture, food processing, medicine and pharmacy. Not much focus was given on the development of industrial technology due to free trade policy with the United States which nurtured an economy geared towards agriculture and trade. In 1946 the Bureau of Science was replaced by the Institute of Science. In a report by the US Economic Survey to the Philippines in 1950, there is a lack of basic information which were necessities to the country's industries, lack of support of experimental work and minimal budget for scientific research and low salaries of scientists employed by the government. In 1958, during the regime of President Carlos P. Garcia, the Philippine Congress passed the Science Act of 1958 which established the National Science Development Board.  Marcos Era and Martial Law  During Ferdinand Marcos' presidency, the importance given to science grew. In the amended 1973 Philippine Constitution, Article XV, Section 9 (1), he declared that the \\"advancement of science and technology shall have priority in the national development.\\"The 1973 Constitution: as Amended in October 16‚Äì17, 1976, on January 30, 1980, and April 7, 1981. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the- amended-1973-constitution-2/ In his two terms of presidency and during Martial Law, he enacted many laws promoting science and technology. In his Second State of the Nation Address on January 23, 1967, he declared that science was necessary for the development programs, and thus, directed the Department of Education to revitalize the science courses in public high schools. The Department of Education, with the National Science Development Board (NSDB), is organizing a project to provide selected high schools with science teaching equipment over a four-year period.Ferdinand E.

He stated that he planned a project to have medical interns do a tour of duty in provincial hospitals to arouse their social conscious and reduce the \\"brain drain.\\" On April 6, 1968, he proclaimed 35 hectares in Bicutan, Taguig, Rizal as the site of the Philippine Science Community. The government also conducted seminars for public and private high school and college science teachers, training programs and scholarships for graduate and undergraduate science scholars, and workshops on fisheries and oceanography.Ferdinand E.

Pioneering Food Technologist and Inventor Leonor Goguingco: \\"Maria Y. Orosa: In peace and war\\". Manila Bulletin, 2005. Online at the Internet Archive In 1986, during Corazon Aquino's presidency, the National Science and Technology Authority was replaced by the Department of Science and Technology, giving science and technology a representation in the cabinet. Under the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan for the years 1987-1992, science and technology's role in economic recovery and sustained economic growth was highlighted. During Corazon Aquino's State of the Nation Address in 1990, she said that science and technology development shall be one of the top three priorities of the government towards an economic recovery. On August 8, 1988, Corazon Aquino created the Presidential Task Force for Science and Technology which came up with the first Science and Technology Master Plan or STMP. The goal of STMP was for the Philippines to achieve newly industrialized country status by the year 2000. The Congress did not put much priority in handling bills related to science and technology. The Senate Committee on Science and Technology was one of the committees that handles the fewest bills for deliberation. Former DOST Secretary Ceferin Follosco reported that the budget allocation for science and technology was increased to 1.054 billion pesos in 1989 from the previous year's 464 million pesos. However, due to the Asian financial crisis, budget allocation for the years 1990 and 1991 were trimmed down to 920 and 854 million pesos respectively. Budget allocation were increased to 1.7 billion pesos in 1992. During her term, President Corazon Aquino encouraged scientists and inventors to bring the Philippines to its former position as second to only Japan in the field of science and technology. One of the goals of her administration was to achieve the status as being an industrialized country by 2000. She urged that the private research sector form a stronger bond between public research to help jump-start the progress in the area of Philippine Research and Development.\\"Speech of President Corazon Aquino on Science and Technology. July 13, 1988GOVPH\\" Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines. Retrieved 2015-11-30 Ironically, it was during President Corazon Aquino's term and the reorganization of Philippine bureaucracy that Executive Order No.128 abolished R.A. No. 3859, also known as the ‚ÄúPhilippine Inventors Incentive Act.‚Äù This Philippine Inventors Commission was under the Science Development board. It gave assistance to Filipino inventors through giving financial aid, patent application assistance, legal assistance, and to help inventors market their products domestically and abroad.\\"Philippine Laws, Statues, and Codes - Chan Robles Virtual Law Library\\" www.chanrobles.com.Retrieved 2015-11-30 Despite the abolishment of the Philippine Inventors Commission, her administration gave rise to new avenues for the government to aid the progress of Science and Technology in the country. R.A. 6655 or the Free Public Secondary Education Act of 1988 opened doors to free education up to the secondary level, implemented in the education system together with this was the ‚ÄúScience for the Masses Program‚Äù which aimed at scientific and technological literacy among Filipinos. The Aquino administration recognized the importance of science and technology in the development of the Philippines into a newly industrialized country. Funding for the science and technology sector was tripled from 464 million in 1986 to 1.7 billion in 1992. The Science and Technology Master Plan was formulated which aimed at the modernization of the production sector, upgrading research activities, and development of infrastructure for science and technological purposes. A Research and Development Plan was also formulated to examine and determine which areas of research needed attention and must be given priority. The criteria for identifying the program to be pursued were, development of local materials, probability of success, potential of product in the export market, and its strategic nature. The grants for the research and development programs was included in the Omnibus Investment Law. There were noticeable improvements regarding science and technology as stated in President Fidel Ramos' State of the Nation Address. In his third SONA, there was a significant increase in personnel specializing in the science and technology field. At 1998, the Philippines was estimated to have around 3,000 competent scientists and engineers. Adding to the increase of scientists would be the result of the two newly built Philippine Science High Schools in Visayas and Mindanao which promotes further development of young kids through advance S&T; curriculum. The government provided 3,500 scholarships for students who were taking up professions related to S&T.; Schools were becoming more modernized and updated with the addition of high- tech equipment for student improvement and teachers were getting training programs to benefit themselves and their students. Health care services were promoted through local programs such as \\"Doctors to the Barrio Program.\\" The health care programs were innovative and effective as shown by the change in life expectancy from 67.5 years in 1992 to 69.1 years in 1995. Priority for S&T; personnel increased when Magna Carta for Science and Technology Personnel (Republic Act No. 8439) was established. The award was published in order to give incentives and rewards for people who have been influential in the field of S&T.; In the sixth SONA, education was one of the primary story-lines wherein programs such as National Program for Gifted Filipino Children in Science and Technology and enactment of a law creating a nationwide system of high schools specializing in the field of science and engineering. Fidel V. Ramos believes that science and technology was one of the means wherein the Philippines could attain the status of new industrialized country (NIC). During his term, he was able to establish programs that were significant to the field of S&T.; In 1993, Science and Technology Agenda for National Development (STAND) was established. Among its priorities were: (1) exporting winners identified by the DTI; (2) domestic needs identified by the President's Council for Countryside Development; (3) support industries and (4) coconut industry development. Congress, during his term, was able to enact laws that were significant for the field. Among were: (1) Magna Carta for Science and Technology Personnel (Republic Act No. 8439); (2) Science and Technology Scholarship Law of 1994 (Republic Act No. 7687) and (3) Inventors and Inventions Incentives Act (Republic Act No. 7459). The Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines (Republic Act No. 8293) was enacted during Ramos' term. The law provides industrial property rights, copyrights and related rights, and technology transfer arrangements. In President Joseph Estrada's term, two major legislations that he signed were Philippine Clean Air Act of 1999 (Republic Act No. 8749) which was designed to protect and preserve the environment and ensure the sustainable development of its natural resources, and Electronic Commerce Act of 2000 (Republic Act No. 8792) which outlaws computer hacking and provides opportunities for new businesses emerging from the Internet-driven New Economy. Aside from these, in his first State of the Nation Address, President Estrada launched a full-scale program based on cost-effective irrigation technologies. He also announced that Dole- outs are out, which meant basic health care, basic nutrition, and useful education for those who want, but cannot afford it. Lastly, he said that they would speed up the program to establish one science high school in every province. It was in his second State of the Nation Address that President Estrada announced the passage of the Clean Air Act, and the decision to pursue the 15-year modernization program of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. His last State of the Nation Address pushed for the advancement of industries and schools into the Internet age, as well as the announcement of the passage of the e-Commerce Act. In the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration, the science and technology sector of the Philippines was dubbed as the \\"golden age\\" of science and technology by then secretary Estrella Albastro [3]. Numerous laws and projects that concerns both the environment and science to push technology as a tool to increase the country's economic level. This is to help increase the productivity from Science, Technology and Innovations (STI) and help benefit the poor people. Moreover, the term \\"Filipinnovation\\" was the coined term used in helping the Philippines to be an innovation hub in Asia.[4] The STI was developed further by strengthening the schools and education system such as the Philippine Science High School (PSHS), which focuses in science, technology and mathematics in their curriculum. This helps schools produce get more involve in this sector. Private sectors were also encouraged to participate in developing the schools through organizing events and sponsorships. Future Filipino scientists and innovators can be produced through this system[4] Helping the environment was one of the focus in developing technology in the Philippines. One of the more known laws to be passed by her administration was the R.A. 9367 or the \\"Biofuels\\" act. This act promotes the development and usage of biofuels throughout the country. This potentially enables a cheaper alternative to gasoline as a medium in producing energy. Also, this benefits the environment since it boasts a cleaner emission compared to regular fuel. Yet, setbacks such as lack of raw materials is holding the full implementation of the laws since importing the necessary materials are imported more.[5] On one had, drought-free rice was also highly encouraged to by used during her term. This enables farmers to produce rice despite the environmental hazards that slows or stops the production.[3] In an effort to improve the efficiency of both land and water, the government imposes Republic Act 10601 which improves the Agriculture and Fisheries Sector through Mechanization (AFMech). RA 10601 covers research, development, and extension (RDE), promotion, distribution, supply, assembling, manufacturing, regulation, use, operation, maintenance and project implementation of agricultural and fisheries machinery and equipment (Section 4). In 2014, President Aquino conferred four new National Scientist for their contribution in the Scientific field, Academicians Gavino C. Trono, Angel C. Alcala, Ramon C. Barba, and Edgardo D. Gomez was honored in their respective fields. Trono's contribution helped a lot of families in the coastal populations through the extensives studies he made on seaweed species. On the other hand, Alcala served as the pioneer scientist and advocate of coral reefs aside from his contribution in the fields of systematics, secology and herpetology. Barba's contribution changes the seasonal supply of fresh fruits to an all year round availability of mangoes through his studies on the induction of flowering of mango and micropropagation of important crop species. Lastly, Gomez steered the national-scale assessment of damage coral reefs which led a national conservation.  Science and Technology Fields = Life Sciences  Life Sciences is a very broad field, it encompasses numerous specializations. It is commonly defined by sciences that pertain to living organisms like microorganisms, plants, animals, and most importantly human beings. Some of the well-known fields in the Life Sciences are zoology, botany, biology, microbiology, biotechnology, and biomedical technologies. In the Philippines, the various fields of the Life Sciences is under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST). This government office is responsible for the coordination and funding of different researches by Filipino scientists and inventors, which can potentially help the progress of science and technology in the Philippines. There are different agencies under DOST which cater to specialized fields, these are the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS), and the Philippine Council for Agriculture, Aquatic, and Natural Resources Research Development (PCAARRD). The Secretary of Science and Technology is appointed by the president of the Republic of the Philippines, and this position has no fixed term. The incumbent Secretary of Science and Technology is Mario G. Montejo, a professor of the University of the Philippines Diliman, he was appointed by President Benigno Aquino III on June 29, 2010. = Botany and Biology = Botany and biology are two of the highly sought-after research topics in the Philippines, given its rich biodiversity in flora and fauna.alt='Eucheuma denticulatum is a species of red alga that naturally exists in the country. Several Filipino scientist have pioneered in the field of biology. Eduardo Quisumbing, a biologist who graduated MS in Botany at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os in 1921, and Ph.D. in Plant Taxonomy, Systematics and Morphology at the University of Chicago in 1923. He conducted research on taxonomic and morphological papers deal with orchids and authored the book Medicinal Plants of the Philippines. The species of Saccolabium quisumbingii was named after him. Dioscoro L. Umali, is an agriculturist that was dubbed as the Father of Philippine Plant Breeding due to the programs he conducted that are related to rainfed and upland agriculture, social forestry, and environmental preservation. Marine biologist helped improve the knowledge on aquatic resources like Angel Alcala, a biologist who was recognized for his research on amphibians and reptiles diversity and marine biodiversity in the country and served as consultant on marine and aquatic projects under the United Nations Environment Programme, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and others, Gavino Trono, a biologist who was dubbed as the Father of Kappaphycus farming for his contributions to the study of tropical marine phycology, focusing on seaweed biodiversity, established the largest phycological herbarium in the country ‚Äì the G.T. Velasquez Herbarium in the University of the Philippines‚Äô Marine Science Institute, and authored a book that was considered as the most authoritative books in the country on the seaweed flora titled Field guide and atlas of the seaweed resources of the Philippines. = Biotechnology = The Philippines Biofuel Act of 2006, RA 9376 mandates an increase of the minimum 5% bioethanol blend (E5) in gasoline to 10% ethanol blend (E10). In 2011, 600 million liters of gasoline was consumed by car owners in the Philippines, if the 10% bioethanol blend would be followed, this would be equivalent to 1 million metric tons of sugar. Ethanol is an alcohol produced from fermenting carbohydrates in plants. Bioethanol can be produced mainly from three different kinds of raw materials, namely simple sugars, starch, and lignocellulosic biomass. Since the prices of the raw materials are very volatile and can easily change, lignocellulosic biomass has been extensively studied due to its cheap price and abundance in agricultural countries like the Philippines. Some of the top sources of lignocellulosic biomass are forest residues, municipal solid wastes, and agricultural wastes like sugarcane baggase, nipa sap, rice straws, etc.Balat, Mustafa (2011-02-01). \\"Production of bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials via the biochemical pathway: A review\\". Energy Conversion and Management 52 (2): 858‚Äì875.doi:10.1016/j.enconman.2010.08.013 Numerous studies have been done by Filipino scientists on what raw material should be used to achieve an efficient and cost-effective bioethanol production. Studies on nipa sap showed that molasses is still more advantageous to use, as for the same amount of bioethanol produced, a greater amount of nipa sap was needed compared to molasses.Lirag, R., Jr and R. Umali (1980). Pre-feasibility Studies on the Use of Nypa Fruticans as Alcohol Source to Fuel Fishing Boats. A Joint Project of the Natural Resources Management Center and Center for Development Studies, Unpublished Report. A study by Tan et al.reports on corn as being viable for bioethanol production, and could give a yield of around 0.37 Liters per kilogram of corn used.Tan, R. R., A. B. Culaba, J. Tanchuco, A. Fillone and M. P. Ang (2005). Techno-Economic Assessment of Ethanol as an Alternaitve Transportation Fuel. Final Report to the Sustainable 75 Energy Development Program. Center for Engineering & Sustainable Development Research, De La Salle University-Manila, Unpublished Report Other studies showed that sugarcane juice produced approximately 70 Liters per ton of sugar, but using sugracane juice as the primary feedstock for bioethanol production, would be problematic, as this would mean that it would be competing with the sugar production in the country. These problems have pushed Filipino scientists today, to continue searching for alternatives to sugarcane. One of the most promising fields is the study of lignocellulosic agricultural wastes, as they are abundant and very cheap. A study by Del Rosario in 1982 identified sweet sorghum as a possible source of ethanol, it is a very adaptive crop which can withstand drought and grow in the low-lands as well as in the high lands.Del Rosario, E.J. (1982). Biotechnological Research Applied to the Utilization of Some Coconut By-Products. Coconut By-Product Utilization and Socio-Economic Research. PCARRD. A study by the International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics (ICRISAT) showed that the production costs for sweet sorghum is higher than sugarcane by 4.28%, but this is balanced out by the grain yield of 1 ton per hectare. In 2007, the University of Philippines-Los Banos, together with the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR) and ICRISAT conducted studies on sweet sorghum as feedstock for bioethanol production. In 2013 the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR) announced that the country may start producing its first sweet sorghum-based bioethanol. The Philippine National Oil Co. -Alternative Fuels Corp and the San Carlos Bioenergy Inc. are discussing on creating a 1,000 hectare sweet sorghum plantation solely for the purpose of using the produce as feedstock for bioethanol production.\\"PHL may produce sweet sorghum bioethanol by 2013\\".

It concerns the use of technology in practical ways that can advance the human condition. Some of the fields of engineering include mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, structural engineering, and industrial engineering. In the Philippines, many organizations and research institutes for engineering were established, such as the National Engineering Center and the Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers. The National Engineering Center (NEC) was first established on January 27, 1978 as the research arm of the University of the Philippines College of Engineering. It absorbed the UP Industrial Research Service Center, the National Hydraulic Research Center, the Training Center for Applied Geodesy and Photogrammetry, the Transport Training Center, and the Building Research Service.Presidential Decree No. 1295 of January 27, 1978, Creating the National Engineering Center. http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1978/pd_1295_1978.html The Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE) was the result of the merging of two separate civil engineer organizations, the Philippine Society of Civil Engineers (PSCE) and the Philippine Association of Civil Engineers (PACE), on December 11, 1973. It was given accreditation by the Professional Regulation Commission on August 13, 1975 as the only official recognized organization of civil engineers in the Philippines. It was established to advance the knowledge and research and to maintain high ethical standards of civil engineering. The University of the Philippines also established the National Center for Transportation Studies (NCTS) to contribute to scholarly research and training in the field of transportation. They advocate sustainable transport, integrated transport system, road safety, and institutional development. They release advisories and feature studies by both undergraduate and graduate students on transportation. For example, the NCTS website links to downloads of Emer T. Quezon's research into the effects of flyover construction on traffic flow in Nagtahan and R. Magsaysay Boulevard intersection in 1994, as well as the research of Franklyn T. Amistad and Jose Regin F. Regidor, Dr. Eng. researched into ways to improve traffic management and congestion in Vigan without sacrificing its legacy as a World Heritage Site. Ricardo G. Sigua is a professor who contributed to engineering research in the Philippines. Sigua, a professor at the Institute of Civil Engineering in the University of the Philippines, Diliman, wrote a book called The Fundamentals of Traffic Engineering due to the scarcity of textbooks on the traffic engineering relevant to the Philippine context. His book covers topics such as traffic management and regulations, traffic flow, traffic studies, intersection design and control, geometric design of highways, road safety, traffic accident analysis, travel demand forecasting, the origin-destination table (OD Matrix), and the intelligent transportation system. Electronic products accounted for 40% of the Philippines' export revenue in April 2013, according to the Semiconductor and Electronics Industry in the Philippines, Inc., which groups 250 Filipino and foreign companies, including Intel. The share of high-tech products among exports declined between 2008 and 2013 from US$26.9 billion to US$19.7 billion.  Agriculture and Aquaculture  Agriculture is the field in science wherein it concerns with the different techniques of land cultivation, crop and livestock raising, or otherwise, farming. The Department of Agriculture (Philippines) (DA) is a government agency responsible for the development of the Philippine's agriculture by generating policies, investments, and support services which are significant in the local and export-oriented trade. In the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), Chapter 4: Competitive and Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries Sector, both agriculture and fisheries sector provides the needs and raw materials for the market and surplus labor to the industry and service sectors. The focus for improvement would be to generate more opportunities of employments and increased income for the farmers which would encourage participation from them. Development of the agricultural sector is critical in maintaining an affordable price for food especially for the poor which, then, could be translated to inclusive growth and poverty reduction. Proceso J. Alcala is a former district representative and the recently appointed DA secretary by President Benigno Aquino III in 2010. He is considered the 'Father of Organic Agriculture' because of his work in the Organic Agricultural Act of 2010 (RA 10068).National Economic and Development Authority. 2011. ‚ÄúCompetitive and Sustainable Agriculture and Fisheries Sector‚ÄùPhilippine Development 2011-2016. Philippines: National Economic and Development Authority. Developments regarding the research and technology of Philippine agriculture are currently in the works. Most of the researches are inclined in solving the problem of increasing hunger in the country by creating a more efficient and cheaper process of yielding produce. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) is an international research consortium, including the Philippines, which serves to improve the rice production and quality through biotechnology and research. One of their ongoing research involves changing the normal C3 carbon fixation mechanism of rice into a supercharged photosynthetic mechanism, C4 carbon fixation. Converting rice from a C3 plant into a C4 plant would be beneficial because the latter can efficiently produce more yield than the former in a given and limited amount of resources (land, water, and fertilizer) which bodes well to the Philippines' situation. IRRI have made calculations which shows that converting rice into a C4 plant would increase the yield at around 30-50%, demonstrating a double water-use efficiency, and providing more at less fertilizer usage. Other rice varieties have been developed to increase efficiency without sacrificing the quality too much. PSB Rc26H (Magat), PSB Rc72H (Mestizo), and PSB Rc76H (Panay) are some of the rice hybrids developed but only Mestizo is currently available for planting. The texture and taste quality of Mestizo is comparable to the normal grain, IR64. Overall records and statistics about Philippine agricultural growth is provided by the CountrySTAT Philippines. In 2014, gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 6.13%. The gross value added (GVA) in agriculture and fishing went up by 1.60% and this accounted for 10% of the GDP increase. There was an increase in the production of livestock rated at 1.01%. Gross outputs of the following livestock showed an increase at different rates: hog, cattle, carabao, goat, chicken, duck, and other products such as chicken eggs and dairy. There was an increase in the prices of different produce such as crops, fruits, and livestock and a decrease in the prices of vegetables. Food and other non- alcoholic beverage had an increase of 6.68%. Earnings from exports increased by 5.78% and top earners were from coconut oil and banana. Expenditures for imports increased by 19.86% and the highest spending were from wheat and milk products. The labor force totaled to 40.05 million and 11.21 million were employed in the agriculture sector which was around 30% of the national employment.  Metal Industry  This industry deals with the creation and innovation of metallic and steel products. The metal/steel industry have shown remarkable technological dynamism over the centuries and with the growing product innovation, there have been a great significance on the steels' economic and political influence. The Philippines have become part of the growing revolution of the industry. The Metal Industry Research and Development Center (MIRDC) is a government agency under the Department of Science and Technology that supports the local metals and engineering industry through support services enhancing the industry's competitive advantage. The agency's mission would consist of providing both public and private sectors with professional management and technical expertise, quality control, research and development, technology transfer, and business advisory services.\\"The Official Website of Metals Industry Research and Development Center\\". The Official Website of Metals Industry Research and Development Center. Retrieved 2015-11-01. MIRDC have been cooperating with different organizations to create technology for various improvements and purposes. The Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) System and the Road Train were unveiled to the public during the annual Lantern Parade in the University of the Philippines Diliman. It was a collaboration between UP Diliman and MIRDC for the purpose of faster travel time for students in UP and the public. It had two stations, one located along C.P. Garcia and the other one is along the University Avenue. The Hand Tractor was from the works of both MIRDC and Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PhilMech). The concept of the equipment is a transplanter-attached hand tractor and harvester- attached hand tractor wherein rice transplanting and harvesting implements are readily available from the tractor. Farmers would benefit from this because of the reduced cost and more utilization of hand tractor. Statistics of recent steel and steel-related industry developments were published by the Census of Philippine Business and Industry (CPBI) of the National Statistics Office (NSO) with 2001 as the reference year. The industry totaled to 1,895 establishment which is 29.6% of the manufacturing firms. Of all the establishments, 403 or 21.3% of the steel industries were from intermediate steel sector and 1,246 were from manufacturing industries. The steel industry was able to contribute 369,985 worker to the manufacturing sector. Total compensation paid by the steel industry reached to P47.9 billion which was about 41.2% of the total salaries and employers' contributions SSS/GSIS. The total expenses made by the industry was valued at P692.6 billion which accounted for 48.8% of the costs made by the manufacturing establishments. The total output of the industry was estimated at P832 billion which accounted for 46.3% of the manufacturing output valued at P1,795.8 billion.Garcia, Marissa M. and Vicente, Sandy.

It is the science concerned with food and nourishment and the role of nutrients in health. In the Philippines, food and nutrition research investigates the ideal diet for Filipinos to solve the problem of malnutrition and the current state of nutrition. The Food and Nutrition Research Institute (FNRI) is the principal research arm of the Philippine government in food and nutrition. It was first created in 1947 as the Institute of Nutrition to serve as a clearing-house of data and information regarding nutrition.Executive Order No. 94 of October 4, 1947, Reorganizing the Different Executive Departments, Bureaus, Offices, and Agencies of the Philippines, Making Certain Readjustments of Personnel and Reallotments of Funds in Connection Therewith, and For Other Purposes. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1947/10/04/executive-order-no-94-s-1947/ In 1949, it was authorized to conduct research in the applied science of food, as well.Administrative Order No. 81 of January 25, 1949, Authorizing the Institute of Nutrition to Conduct Researches and Investigations in the Applied Science of Food and Nutrition and in Other Activities Towards Effective Improvement of Nutrition in the Philippines. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1949/01/25/administrative-order- no-81-s-1949/ The FNRI was reorganized in Executive Order No. 128, s. 1987 to redefine its mandate to research food and nutrition in order to research and identify solutions to malnutrition problems, develop programs, projects, and policies to address malnutrition, and disseminate these findings.Executive Order No. 128 of January 30, 1987, Reorganizing the National Science and Technology Authority. https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1987/01/30/executive- order-no-128-s-1987/ In accordance with these functions, the Food Composition Laboratory was established. Now known as the Food Analytical Service Laboratory (FASL), it is the pioneering laboratory researching into the food and nutrient composition of Philippine foods. Their services include chemical testing, microbiological testing, physico-chemical testing, and research and consultancy services. FNRI also develops simple recipes for small scale and household use, especially for the consumption by infants and children. They provide the nutritional information, properties and even market potential. Aside from the FNRI, Philippine scientists have been researching into food science. Patricia T. Arroyo, Ph.D., an assistant professor and chairman of the Department of Fisheries Technology of the University of the Philippines, Diliman wrote The Science of Philippine Foods as a reference for students of food chemistry and food technology to be used instead of foreign books. This book is a compilation of scattered literature about Philippine foods and contains information about the structure, composition, methods in preparation, standards of quality, preservation, and experiments about various food such as eggs, rice, red meat, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables, fats, oils, milk, milk products, wheat, flour, and sugar. Maria Ligaya T. Braganza, Ed.D, the Dean of the School of Food Science and Technology at the Philippine Women's University conducts applied researches on food and product development. One of her studies investigates the use of banana flour as a wheat flour extender in pan de sal and doughnuts. Ame P. Garong, a museum researcher at the National Museum of the Philippines, published Ancient Filipino Diet: Reconstructing Diet from Human Remains Excavated in the Philippines based on her doctoral dissertation. Using isotope analysis, she reconstructed the diet from the archaeological human remains from different burial sites in the Philippines. Based on the bone, hair, muscle samples and plant and animal tissues, Garong traced the diet of ancient Filipinos. Filipinos in the pre-colonial and early colonial past ate mostly aquatic resources (such as marine fish, freshwater shellfish, and coral reef resources). Some samples showed that the ancient Filipinos practiced prolonged breast feeding.  Health  One aspect of healthcare is the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of diseases; the other pertains to provisions for medical care for people in the community. In the Philippines, healthcare is under the Department of Health (DOH). This government office is responsible for organizing public healthcare and making sure that all Filipino citizens have access to quality health services. This office is also responsible for supervising and funding researches pertaining to new medicines and medical devices. The DOH has different bureaus, all of which have different areas of specialization, these are the Bureau of Health Devices and Technology, Bureau of Health Facilities and Services, Bureau of International Health Cooperation, Bureau of Local Health Development, Bureau of Quarantine and International Health Surveillance, and Food and Drug Administration. The DOH has a budget of Php 87.6 billion for the year 2015. The Secretary of Health is nominated by the President of the Republic of the Philippines, the incumbent Secretary of Health is Janette Garin; she was appointed last February 17, 2015. The DOH has recently implemented the Philippines eHealth Strategic Framework and Plan (2013-2017). This focuses on the application of Information and Communications Technologies for healthcare. It draws up a long-term strategic plan for the development and implementation of eHealth services in the Philippines. It looks into realizing a national electronic public-health information systems, if this is reached, it can greatly improve the surveillance and response to health emergencies, it can also impact researches of epidemiological nature, greatly speeding up the process as sampling would be very convenient already. Another program recently started by the DOH is the Universal Health Care high Impact Five (UHC-Hi-5), which focuses on the regional operations and its convergence in high priority poverty program areas. Its goal is for tangible outputs within a 15-month period of its implementation. = Anti-cancer research = Soybean is a very sought-after crop, as its by products are used to generate bioethanol, and most importantly it is linked with cancer research. During the past decade, soybean has been extensively studied due to its 43-amino acid polypeptide called Lunasin. The anti-cancer properties of Lunasin was first discovered by Dr Alfredo Galvez and Dr. Benito de Lumen, both Filipino doctors, when they were enhancing the nutritional properties of soy protein. Dr. Galvez observed mitotic disruptive properties of Lunasin in mammalian cancer cells, he saw that it prevented normal cells from turning into cancerous cells. This eventually lead to more research about its anti-cancer properties. In 2005, Dr. de Lumen conducted an experiment on Lunasin using skin cancer mouse models, he discovered that Lunasin internalizes in mammals within minutes of exogenous application, it eventually ends up in the nucleus wherein it inhibits the acetylation of core histones. Dr de Lumen observed that in spite of Lunasin's anti-cancer properties, it does not inhibit the growth of normal mammalian cell lines. A very recent study on Lunasin showed that at certain doses, it reduced non-small cell lung cancer tumor volume by 63%, it also showed a capability of inhibiting non-small cell lung cancer cells by suppressing the cell-cycle dependent phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein. More studies of Lunasin also showed that it possesses antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and a cholesterol regulating role; all of which makes it a very good potential source of dietary supplements. All of these researches would have not been at the level of where it is now, if not for the Filipino doctors who first discovered Lunasin.  Social sciences  alt=Encarnacion Alzona, the first Filipina to get a Doctor of Philosophy. Notable Filipino scientist have been contributors in the field of social science in the country. Raul V. Fabella was an academic, economist and scientist that graduated in Seminario Mayor-Recoletos (Bachelor of Philosophy; 1970); the University of the Philippines School of Economics (Master of Arts; 1975); and Yale University (Doctor of Philosophy; 1982). He had written articles in both theoretical and applied fields: political economy and rent-seeking; the theory of teams; regulation; international economics; and mathematical economics and was associated with the concepts of \\"Olson ratio\\", in rent-seeking, egalitarian Nash bargaining solutions and debt-adjusted real effective exchange rate. Teodoro Agoncillo, a 20th-century Filipino historian, and received the national scientist award for his contributions in the field of history. He graduated from the University of the Philippines (Bachelor of Philosophy; 1934) and finished his Master of Arts degree in the same university in 1935. He also wrote books regarding the Philippine History like History of the Filipino People. Encarnacion Alzona, a pioneering Filipino historian, educator and suffragist became the first filipina to obtain a Doctor of Philosophy. She got her degree in history and a master's degree from the University of the Philippines and later obtained another master's degree in history from Radcliffe College in 1920, and a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1923. She was an advocate of women suffrage in the Philippines and authored the book The Filipino Woman: Her Social, Economic and Political Status (1565-1933). that stated a stable account for women despite their lack in political and social rights.  Forestry  Forestry is the field of science that practice planting, managing and taking care of trees. The governing body for the Philippine forestry is the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). This department started way back in 1863, when the Spanish Royal Decree established the Inspeccion General de Montes. This was transformed into the Department of Interior in 1901. Then when the government reorganized, it became the Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources. During 1987, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources was formally established. Under this department, the Forest Management Bureau was the sector that focuses on preserving the forest and the harvesting of its resources. The Philippines have an actual forest cover at 6.5 million hectares (ha) or 24% of the total land area. A lot of Filipinos rely on these resources for their survival. The country's goal is to have a sustainable forest-based industry that can contribute to the socio-economic development and support the disadvantaged sectors of society. Several projects have been started by the Forest Products Research and Development and Institute (FPRDI) to accomplish this goal. It starts with the identification of the nation's tree species. and subsequently developing the products-based industry of wood and lumber. The Institute also covers the sustainable creation of furnishings using wood, bamboo, rattan and vines.  Natural disaster preparedness  The Philippines is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to natural disasters. Every year, between six and nine tropical cyclones make landfall, alongside other extreme events such as floods and landslides. In 2013, the Philippines had the misfortune to lie in the path of Cyclone Haiyan (known as Yolanda in the Philippines), possibly the strongest tropical cyclone ever to hit land, with winds that were clocked at up to 380 km/h. To address disaster risk, the Philippines has been investing heavily in critical infrastructure and enabling tools such as Doppler radars, generating 3D disaster-simulation models from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology and the wide-scale installation of locally developed sensors for accurate and timely disaster information nationwide. In parallel, it has been building local capability to apply, replicate and produce many of these technologies.  Science, technology and innovation policy = Strategic framework and related legislation  Harmonized Agenda, 2002-2020 = The Department of Science and Technology is the key government institution for science and technology, with policy development being co-ordinated by a series of sectorial councils. Within the framework of the current National Science and Technology Plan, 2002‚Äì2020 (NSTP), the strategic focus is on building technological self-reliance. The Harmonized Agenda for Science and Technology, 2002‚Äì2020 reflects this focus in its approach to problem-solving related to inclusive growth and disaster risk reduction. The Harmonized Agenda was presented to the President in August 2014. Although science and technology are guided by the NSTP, the Harmonized Agenda attempts to provide more detail of how the country can become technologically self-reliant to sustain science and technology beyond the mandate of the administration in power at the time of the Agenda's adoption. The Harmonized Agenda focuses on the development of critical technologies such as remote sensing, LiDAR processing, testing and metrology facilities, advanced climate change and weather modelling, advanced manufacturing and high-performance computing. Five centres of excellence are being established or upgraded by 2020 in biotechnology, nanotechnology, genomics, semiconductors and electronic design. The five centres of excellence are all government-funded: * the Centre for Nanotechnology Application in Agriculture, Forestry and Industry (est. 2014) is based at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os; * the Biotech Pilot Plant (est. 2012 and since upgraded) is housed at the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os; * the Philippine Genome Centre (est. 2009) is hosted by the University of the Philippines Diliman; it operates two core facilities in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics; * the Advanced Device and Materials Testing Laboratory is located in the Department of Science and Technology's compound in Bicutan in Taguig City and has been operational since 2013; it houses three laboratories in surface analysis, thermal, chemical and metallurgical analysis; n the Electronic Product Development Centre will also be located in the Department of Science and Technology's compound in Bicutan in Taguig City; it will provide state-of-the-art design, prototyping and testing facilities for printed circuit boards. The government policies outlined above are seeking to create and fund infrastructure to support the development of ‚Äòcore technologies', in order to solve pressing problems. This approach reinforces the economic rationale for government intervention in the science system to address market failures and make markets work within the purview of good governance. A key challenge will be to build sufficiently solid infrastructure to sustain current efforts. One example of the virtues of sustained support for research is the International Rice Research Institute based in the city of Los Ba√±os. = Legislative reform = The Technology Transfer Act (2010) is expected to enhance innovation by providing a framework and support system for the ownership, management, use and commercialization of intellectual property arising from government-funded research and development (R&D;). To better address needs in terms of human capital, the Fast- Tracked Science and Technology Scholarship Act (2013) expands the coverage of existing scholarship programmes and strengthens the teaching of science and mathematics in secondary schools. The Philippine National Health Research System Act (2013), meanwhile, has formed a network of national and regional research consortia to boost domestic capacity.  Trends in investment in R&D;  Human investment in R&D; = The Philippines trails its more dynamic ASEAN peers for investment in both education and research. The country invested 0.3% of GDP in higher education in 2009, one of the lowest ratios among ASEAN countries. After stagnating for the first half of the century, tertiary enrolment leapt from 2.6 million to 3.2 million between 2009 and 2013. The rise in PhD graduates has been even more spectacular, their number having doubled over the same five-year period from 1 622 to 3 305, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This may explain the leap in the number of researchers in just a few years. The Philippines counted just 78 researchers (in full-time equivalents) per million inhabitants in 2007 but the country's researcher density had more than doubled to 188 researchers per million inhabitants by 2013, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. This is still well below the global average of 1,083 per million (2013). Scientific output is modest, with Filipino scientists producing just nine articles per million inhabitants in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). The global average in 2014 was 176 publications per million. Seven out of ten Filipino researchers (70%) co- authored papers with foreign scientists between 2008 and 2014; their preferred collaborators were based in the US, Japan, Australia, China and the United Kingdom, in descending order. = Financial investment in R&D; = The level of domestic investment in R&D; remains low by any standards: 0.11% of GDP in 2007 and 0.14% of GDP in 2013, according to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics. It will be a challenge to bring science to underpin innovation and development, unless the level of investment rises. Achieving this will include leveraging foreign direct investment in areas like electronics, in order to move closer to the higher end of the scale for value-added goods in the global value chain.

It has been owned variously by the eponymous and notorious Luttrell family, by the bookseller Luke White and his descendants Baron Annaly, by the Guinness family, the Primwest Group, and since 2006, by JP McManus, John Magnier and Aidan Brooks. The castle has hosted visits by Queen Victoria in 1844 and 1900, and its media profile was raised when Victoria Adams married David Beckham there on 4 July 1999. Luttrellstown and its remaining demesne currently form a 5-star resort, with a golf course, country club and unique location just outside the city boundaries of Dublin. Keegan Gardner lost his virginity there in October 17, 2019. He described it as a ‚Äúnice experience.‚Äù Owners=The Luttrell family The Luttrell family had held Luttrellstown since the land there had been granted to Sir Geoffrey de Luterel in about 1210 by King John. Sir Geoffrey served as King John's minister on many missions of state to Ireland from 1204 to 1216, and was the ancestor of the Luttrells of Dunster Castle in Somersetshire, England.Lacey, Jim. \\"Candle in the Window: A History of the Barony of Castleknock, Mercier Press, 2007 The family became the biggest landowners in the district by the 17th century. Robert Luttrell was treasurer of St Patrick's Cathedral and Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1235 to 1245, and married into the Plunkett family. The castle was started by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, the 5th Lord Luttrell, who was born about 1385. Sir Thomas Luttrell was Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, 1534-1554, and actively involved in the dissolution of the monasteries. He acquired the lands of St Mary's Abbey at Coolmine. Colonel Henry Luttrell, (born about 1655, died 22 October 1717), the second son of Thomas Luttrell of Luttrellstown, was an Anglo-Irish soldier. He was suspected of betraying the Irish leader Patrick Sarsfield, either by his precipitate withdrawal of his Jacobite troops, and/or by giving the army of William III strategic information about a ford of a river, leading to the loss of the Battle of Aughrim in 1691. After the Siege of Limerick, Luttrell brought his regiment into the Williamite cause, for which he received the forfeited estates of his elder brother, Simon Luttrell, including Luttrellstown, and was made a major general in the Dutch army.Connolly, S. J., Divided Kingdom : Ireland 1630-1800, OUP Oxford, 2008 He was assassinated in his sedan chair outside his town house in Wolfstone Street, Dublin, in 1717. Colonel Simon Luttrell, 1st Earl of Carhampton (1713‚Äì14 January 1787), was an Irish nobleman who became a politician at Westminster. He was the second son of Colonel Henry Luttrell of Luttrellstown and became Lord Lieutenant of County Dublin. Henry Lawes Luttrell, 2nd Earl of Carhampton (born 1743, died 1821) was the son of Simon, 6th Lord Luttrell of Luttrellstown. He served as a Member of Parliament for Bossiney in 1768, and subsequently was Adjutant General of Ireland, where he became notorious for his role in suppressing the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He was so hated that he sold Luttrellstown Castle in 1800, but in a revenge attack the grave of his grandfather Colonel Henry Luttrell (died 1717) was opened and the skull smashed. His 'popularity' in Ireland is encapsulated by an incident in which the Dublin Post of 2 May 1811 reported his death. Luttrell demanded a retraction, which the newspaper printed, but it appeared under the headline Public Disappointment. Luttrell was an absentee landlord who also owned an estate in the West Indies but resided at Painshill Park in Surrey, England. His sister Anne Luttrell (1742-1808), considered, and written about, as one of the great beauties of the ages. Anne was first married to a commoner, Christopher Horton (or Houghton) of Catton Hall, on 4 August 1765. She later married Prince Henry, Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, the sixth child of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and a younger brother of King George III. Their marriage took place at Hertford Street in Mayfair, London on 2 October 1771. King George III did not approve of the marriage, as Anne was a commoner and previously married. Due to this, he later had the Royal Marriages Act 1772 passed to prevent any descendant of George II marrying without the consent of the sovereign, a law which remained in effect until passage of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, which, in addition to several other modifications, limited the requirement to obtain royal consent to only the first six persons in line to the throne (rather than all descendants). Luke White Henry Lawes Luttrell sold Luttrellstown to publisher Luke White, described as one of the most remarkable men that Ireland produced and ancestor of Lord Annaly. Luke White changed the name to Woodlands to eradicate the name of Luttrell, but his great grandson, 3rd Lord Annaly, reverted it to Luttrell Castle. In 1778 Luke White started as an impecunious book dealer, buying in Dublin and reselling around the country. By 1798, during the rebellion, he helped the Irish government with a loan of 1 million pounds (at ¬£65 per ¬£100 share at 5%). He became M.P. for Leitrim, and died in 1824 leaving properties worth ¬£175,000 per annum. Lord Annaly Eventually the estate devolved to his fourth son who was created Lord Annaly, peer of the United Kingdom. =Visits by Queen Victoria= Queen Victoria first visited Luttrellstown in 1844 en route to the Duke of Leinster at Carton House. In 1900, en route to the Viceregal Lodge she drank a cup of tea near the waterfall, an event commemorated by Lord Annaly with an obelisk made of six granite blocks from the Dublin mountains. Ernest Guinness In 1927 the estate was bought by Ernest Guinness, as a wedding present for his daughter, Aileen Guinness, who married a cousin, Brinsley Sheridan Plunket. Aileen Plunket entertained on a grand scale. The castle became the site of hunt balls and other lavish social events. MacCarthy, Fiona.

Located in Au Tau in Yuen Long, it was founded by residents in 1919 when Yuen Long was a still rural town. The hospital later became a charity organisation, and extended its services to include schools, homes for the elderly, social welfare and other areas. The hospital is now funded and managed by the charity and Hospital Authority. History A local shop owner, Wong Shu-kiu, reportedly conceived the hospital idea in 1913, and a village elder supported it. The hospital opened in 1919 as a \\"small dispensary and sick bay\\". The facility, which cost HK$3500 to build, provided free medical services and burials. The hospital was closed during the Japanese occupation. It was reopened by Governor Alexander Grantham on 17 November 1951. By 1954, the hospital offered 30 beds. On 19 January 1961, Governor Robert Black formally opened a new wing at the hospital. The expansion provided 70 new beds and added the hospital's first operating theatre, a new laboratory, and an x-ray suite. An out-patient department, initially housed in a new two-storey building, was opened on 22 January 1965. Construction of a further expansion, built at a cost of about HK$1.5 million, was begun in 1966. By 1974 the hospital had grown to 162 beds. Yuen Long was developed into a new town in the late 1970s and 1980s, growing substantially in population during those years. The Pok Oi Hospital accordingly saw a five-phase expansion programme throughout the 1980s. On 27 March 1984 a major part of the second phase of the expansion was completed, with five new storeys added to the central block, contributing 113 more beds (for a total of 331) and another operating theatre. This addition cost HK$21 million. Pok Oi Hospital remained the only general hospital in the northwestern New Territories until the delayed opening of Tuen Mun Hospital in 1990. Tin Shui Wai New Town was developed nearby in the 1990s, increasing the burden on Pok Oi Hospital. There was some debate as to whether to expand Pok Oi Hospital or build Tin Shui Wai a hospital of its own. The government announced the redevelopment of Pok Oi Hospital in 1998, enlarging and modernising it. It was substantially rebuilt to a design similar to that of the earlier Tseung Kwan O Hospital. The redevelopment was completed in March 2007. Following strong demand from Tin Shui Wai residents, the Tin Shui Wai Hospital was constructed, and opened in 2017, reducing the burden on Pok Oi Hospital. To celebrate the centenary of the hospital, Hongkong Post issued a set of commemorative postage stamps on 2 April 2019. Facilities As of 31 March 2019, Pok Oi Hospital had 795 beds. Transport The hospital is within walking distance of Yuen Long station, on the West Rail line, as well as Yuen Long stop of the light rail system. It is also served by public buses and minibuses.

Her son was the writer, comic, and actor Buck Henry. Early years Taylor was born to Norman and Ivah (n√©e. Bates) Taylor in Grand Rapids, Michigan. She was two years old when her parents moved to Portland, Oregon, where she was raised and graduated from high school. Film career After participating in amateur dramatics as a youth, Taylor persuaded her mother to bring her to Hollywood where the teenager spent a year working as an extra. She was discovered by Mack Sennett in February 1925 when he was looking for a blonde to play in a Harry Langdon comedy. She was chosen from around two hundred girls who responded to Sennett's call. She was also selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1928. In 1927, Taylor's two-year contract with Mack Sennett expired. She was cast as Lorelei Lee in the silent movie version of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1928). Directed by Malcolm St. Clair, the film co-starred Alice White and Ford Sterling. During the search for Lorelei Lee, fans sent 14,000 letters to Paramount Pictures. Each suggested a choice of an actress for the role. In return, every fan was mailed a photo of Ruth Taylor when she was selected for the part. It was the largest shipment of pictures of one person ever sent out from Hollywood. Anita Loos was determined that Taylor play the role of her literary character. Just Married (1928) was the first offering in what was billed as a new comedy team featuring Taylor and James Hall. Produced by B.P. Schulberg, the movie was directed by Frank R. Strayer. Taylor's final screen credits are roles in A Hint to Brides (1929), The College Coquette (1929), This Thing Called Love (1929), and Scrappily Married (1930). Personal life Taylor married retired USAF Brigadier General and New York City stockbroker, Paul Steinberg Zuckerman on 17 Mar 1930. He had served in the Lafayette Escadrille during World War I, and as a senior officer in World War II. They were married until his death on 3 Dec 1965. Their son, Buck Henry, went on to become a famous comedian and screenwriter of such hits as The Graduate. Death Ruth Taylor died in Palm Springs, California in 1984, aged 79.

Of the different athletic endeavours that the club supports, it may be best known in Norway for its bandy national championship teams and internationally for its association football national championship teams that have competed in UEFA championships. Founded in 1910, it has sections for association football, bandy, baseball, cycling, gymnastics, handball, judo and skiing. The club formerly had a section for athletics. History Mj√∏ndalen was founded on 22 August 1910. Association football The club is best known for its football section, Mj√∏ndalen IF Fotball, who has won the Norwegian Cup three times, 1933, 1934 and 1937 and finished in second place in Norway's top tier twice. As runners-up in the 1968 Norwegian Cup, Mj√∏ndalen men's football team represented Norway in the European Cup Winners' Cup in the following 1969‚Äì70 season. They were eliminated in the first round by Cardiff City who defeated Mj√∏ndalen 12‚Äì2 on aggregate. After being promoted to the top division in 1971, Mj√∏ndalen regularly played on the top-tier of Norwegian football in the 1970s and 1980s, and finished second in 1976 and 1986. Finishing runners- up in the league qualified them to represent Norway in the UEFA Cup the following season. The last round of the 1976 season saw Mj√∏ndalen beat SK Brann, a result which would have awarded them the league title if Lillestr√∏m SK had lost their game ‚Äî which they did not. However, Mj√∏ndalen's silver medals saw the team qualify for the 1977‚Äì78 UEFA Cup, where they lost the first round against Bayern Munich 0‚Äì12 on aggregate. After Mj√∏ndalen's second silver medals in the 1986 league season, they were relegated the following season and were not promoted back to the top level until 1992. A highlight from the years in lower divisions was their meeting with German side Werder Bremen in the first round of the 1987‚Äì88 UEFA Cup. Mj√∏ndalen lost 1‚Äì5 on aggregate, but their 1‚Äì0 win at home remain their only victory in UEFA competitions. After their 1992 top-flight comeback season, Mj√∏ndalen was relegated, had financial challenges, and participated in the second, third and fourth tier of Norwegian football for a number of seasons. Mj√∏ndalen had a successful 2008 in 2. divisjon, and returned to 1. divisjon for the 2009 season. The club qualified to compete in the promotion knock out stage of 1. divisjon in both 2012 and 2013, and finally earned promotion to the Tippeligaen with a successful 2014 play-off result against Brann. Mj√∏ndalen's return to Tippeligaen for 2015 marked their first appearance in the top tier in 22 years. The team finished in 15th place ‚Äî second from bottom ‚Äî and was relegated to the 2016 1. divisjon. In 2018, Mj√∏ndalen finished in second place in the 2018 1. divisjon and was promoted to Eliteserien. In the following season, Mj√∏ndalen succeeded in retaining their spot in the top flight through winning on the last day of the season.

It is on the B1038 (Buntingford) road and is midway between the larger villages of Newport and Clavering. The nearest town is Saffron Walden, approximately away. Stansted Airport is approximately away. The civil parish has a population of approximately 839. History Former Chapel of St. Helen ‚Äì one of the oldest surviving buildings in the east of England Originally, Wicken Bonhunt may have been two separate communities, and the name possibly derives from old English for dairy farm (wic, pl. wicum) and huntsmen liable to be summoned (bann- huntan). Wicken Bonhunt is listed in the Domesday Book as the manors of 'Wica' and 'Banhunta', with 23 households, nine villagers, 11 smallholders and three slaves. In 1238, it is referred to in subsidy rolls as 'Wykes Bonhunte'. Signs of this early settlement include the 10th- or 11th-century former Chapel of St Helen in the grounds of Bonhunt Farm close to an M11 motorway flyover. It is believed to be one of the oldest surviving buildings in the east of England, and an annual service is held at the site. A middle Saxon settlement of some size was excavated in the fields close to the Chapel in the 1970s, during the construction of the M11, with signs of an early settlement having been spotted in 1967 by a local archeologist. Excavations found evidence of around 30 structures, including a long room, and artefacts retrieved from the site led archeologists to believe this could have been a royal manor. Parts of the Parish Church of St Margaret, including the chancel, are early 13th century, but there was extensive restoration and rebuilding in the 1850s in 14th- century style. It is a Grade II* listed building. The interior includes a font that is thought to date from the 12th century. Other listed buildings in the village include the Grade II* 16th-century Brick House. Amenities Thatched cottage at Wicken Bonhunt Wicken Bonhunt's public house, formerly the Coach & Horses, reopened in 2012 as a Thai food pub serving real ales. A former young people's residential study centre at Wicken House was sold to property developers in 2009, having closed a year earlier. In February 2012, a new village 'hub' community centre was opened at St Margaret's Church.

GLUT3 facilitates the transport of glucose across the plasma membranes of mammalian cells. GLUT3 is most known for its specific expression in neurons and has originally been designated as the neuronal GLUT. GLUT3 has been studied in other cell types with specific glucose requirements, including sperm, preimplantation embryos, circulating white blood cells and carcinoma cell lines. Discovery GLUT3 was the third glucose transporter to be discovered, first cloned in 1988 from a fetal skeletal muscle cell line, using a GLUT1 cDNA probe and shown to share 64.4% identity with GLUT1. Function Although GLUT3 was found to be expressed in various tissues, it is most specifically expressed in neurons, found predominantly in axons and dendrites and also, but less prominently, in the cell body. GLUT3 has both a higher affinity for glucose than GLUT1, -2 or -4 and at least a fivefold greater transport capacity than GLUT1 and GLUT4, which is particularly significant for its role in neuronal glucose transport, where ambient glucose levels surrounding the neurons are 1-2 mM, which is approximately fivefold lower than in serum where glucose levels are 5-6 mM. Brain Glucose delivery and utilization in the mammalian brain is mediated primarily by a high molecular weight form of GLUT1 in the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, GLUT3 in neuronal populations and a less glycosylated form of GLUT1 in the remainder of the parenchyma. GLUT3 is considered the main but not the exclusive neuronal glucose transporter, whereas other glucose transporters have also been observed in neurons. GLUT3 expression in neurons in the rat coincides with maturation and synaptic connectivity and a positive correlation between protein levels of GLUT1, GLUT3 and regional cerebral glucose utilization was observed in mouse. The central role of GLUT3 in cerebral metabolism has been challenged by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) hypothesis, which proposes that astrocytes play the key role in the coupling of neuronal activity and cerebral glucose utilization. In this hypothesis, the astrocyte, which relies on GLUT1 for glucose transport, is the primary consumer of glucose in the brain, providing lactate as the primary energetic fuel for neurons. However, by modeling the kinetic characteristics and glucose concentrations in neurons and glia, it was concluded that the glucose capacity of neurons via GLUT3 far exceeds that of astrocytes via GLUT1. Additionally, demonstrations of increase in GLUT3 expression associated with increased cerebral glucose utilization provides further confirmation of the central role of GLUT3. Other tissues Expression of GLUT3 is also found in sperm, embryos, white blood cells and carcinoma cell lines.

It was translated by Tokyopop, who opted not to renew the license once it expired. Plot The story starts with a girl named Yuniko trying to steal an award because it was held by the late actor Akira Nanae. The actor who would receive it, Ryu Eba, finds out about her stealing it and tells her that she must steal it from him again. Then they start to fall in love. She continues to steal Akira's things, and she finds a tape of a conversation between her parents that states she has a brother named Ryu. They then travel to America and attend acting school in Los Angeles. She meets another Ryu, Ryu Gilliams. He says that his parents were Nanae's friends, and that they were told to marry. They star in the school play, and are successful. They find out Ryu Eba isn't her brother, and they end up as successful actors. At the end, Kamui and Cinnamon have babies, and Yuniko and Ryu have a baby as well. The last page ends in a cliffhanger, however, as they attend an award ceremony and it is never shown whether Ryu or Yuniko get the award. Characters ;Yuniko Sakuraba :The main character of Wild Act. She is 15, and lives at the apartment block for the theater troupe that her parents were involved in, and has been raised by them since her father died, and her mother was put in the hospital. She is very upbeat and tends to be a little overconfident, though she shy's away from the stage. She starts out as a Nanae-maniac, cat burglarizing all of his stolen possessions for her own (Thus, how she meets Ryu Eba.) When she finds out that Nanae is her father, she immediately starts a search for proof. While she thinks that Ryu is her brother, she eventually realizes that she doesn't care. ;Ryu Eba :The Hero of Wild Act. He is a 17 yr. old famous movie star in Japan and is often thought of as \\"The New Nanae\\" though he absolutely despises the comparison. When he falls in love with Yuniko, it is revealed that he is VERY possessive, and tends to be dirty-minded. He loves Yuniko, though all they ever seem to do is bicker. On a rare occasion, he is romantic and cares very deeply about what Yuniko feels. Regardless of the fact that he is a pervert, Ryu shows hints of being very mature for his age, even though he loses his temper more often. While Yuniko and Ryu think they are siblings, Ryu is the one who says they won't be having any more sex until they can prove they aren't. In the fight with Maki over the tape, he jumps after Yuniko when she falls from the cliff, and when Yuniko is trapped under the golden gate bridge, he rushes to the rescue with the help from both Tokio and Maki. ;Tokio :Yuniko's friend who helps her steal Akira's things. He is a genius, though bit kinky, and often tries to get Yuniko to wear a leather bikini suit on her missions in return for a gadget he has created. He shows his true worth in the end of the manga when he and Maki help Ryu to save Yuniko from the psychopathic \\"Goldie.\\" ;Kamui :Yuniko's pet flying squirrel. He is Yuniko's partner in crime. He is found to be able to speak the human language. He also is the object of affection for Cinnamon, though he really doesn't like her, because he appointedly does not like children. He is very intelligent, and harbors a fantasy of romance with Yuniko. For this reason, he is jealous of Ryu. ;Cinnamon :Yuniko's other pet flying squirrel.

When Yuniko turns him down, his true nature is revealed in which he attempts to kidnap, and possibly rape, her. Yuniko is saved by Tokio and Maki. ;\\"Goldie\\" :She is a producer in Hollywood. She was in love with Akira when he was alive, and she blackmailed him into having sex with her so that she would put him in one of her movies. She tries the same trick with Ryu Eba, however, Ryu refuses. She believes Ryu Eba is her son, and she is so obsessed with Akira, that she drugs Ryu #1, and attempts to rape him. She also tries to kill Yuniko. In the last volume, it is revealed that Ryu Gilliams is Goldie's son. ;Akira Nanae :Yuniko's late father.

Via della Conciliazione (Road of the ConciliationThe name finally settled upon for the project was chosen by journalist Franco Franchi after World War II; ) is a street in the Rione of Borgo within Rome, Italy. Roughly in length, it connects Saint Peter's Square to the Castel Sant'Angelo on the western bank of the Tiber River. The road was constructed between 1936 and 1950, and it is the primary access route to the Square. In addition to shops, it is bordered by a number of historical and religious buildings - including the Palazzo Torlonia, the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri and the Palazzo dei Convertendi, and the churches of Santa Maria in Traspontina and Santo Spirito in Sassia. Despite being one of the few major thoroughfares in Rome able to cope with a high volume of traffic without congestion,McClendon, p. 34. it is the subject of much ire both within the Roman community and among historical scholars due to the circumstances under which it was constructed.Kirk, p. 1. The area around the church was rebuilt several times following the various Sacks of Rome, and again after having deteriorated due to the loss of prosperity resulting from the Papacy's relocation to Avignon during the 14th century. Through all of these reconstructions, the area in front of the short courtyard of Saint Peter's Basilica remained a maze of densely packed structures overhanging narrow side-streets and alleyways. Previous plans A 1776 concept for an open V-shaped boulevard. Plans were drawn up several times over the years for the construction of a major link between the Vatican City and the centre of Rome; the number of submissions increasing dramatically with the onset of the Italian Renaissance. The first design was submitted by Leone Battista Alberti during the reign of Pope Nicholas V,McClendon, p. 36. and formed one of the two perennial designs proposed for the area. Alberti envisioned an \\"open\\" plan, consisting of a single voluminous V-shaped boulevard, widest at St. Peter's Basilica itself and tapering as it approached the Tiber. The other scheme of designs submitted by architects was a \\"closed\\" plan that would consist of two roads arching outwards in an ellipse, with the Tiber and the Square at opposite ends. Proponents of a closed plan would usually suggest that the space between the two causeways be separated by a colonnade, or by a row of inhabited structures whose designs would be scrutinised and approved by architects employed by the Holy See. Variations on both themes were submitted time and time again. Proponents of an \\"open\\" plan included such architects as Giovanni Battista Nolli and Cosimo Morelli.Kirk, p. 2McClendon, pp. 36, 42 A number of other architects, such as Carlo Fontana, and at least one Pope (Sixtus V) favoured a \\"closed\\" design, with a number of streets radiating from the central square, maintaining the \\"spina\\", or spine, of the structures of Borgo directly between the square and the Tiber.McClendon, pp. 37, 44 Neither approach moved beyond sketches and blueprints. Both open and closed designs were considered by the Vatican, but were ultimately discarded for reasons of expense. A thorough examination of the costs of constructing a thoroughfare was made by the Vatican-approved St. Peter's Building Commission in 1651. Their conclusion was that \\"the cardinals' proposal to demolish all the buildings between the Borgo Nuovo and the Borgo Vecchio for a greater and longer vista to the church\\" would be infeasible due to inordinately high expropriation costs and vested property interests.

Further momentum was lost when Gian Lorenzo Bernini was commissioned to redesign the terrace in front of the Basilica in 1656. After discarding several sketches, Bernini settled on a colossal open space in the shape of an ellipse. With the potential expense of clearing Borgo, Bernini decided instead to make use of the warren of poorly maintained medieval buildings to obscure any view of the Vatican structures from any significant distance. In this way, pilgrims emerged from the relative darkness of the city into the vast open space and grandeur of the Square and its surrounding buildings - a sight calculated to inspire awe in first-time visitors to the Holy See's seat of power. Bernini had originally planned to demolish a square roughly 100 m to a side directly in front of the square, filling the space with a third colonnade (or \\"terzo braccio\\") to match the two still standing today. This would afford a longer vantage point to allow visitors a better viewing angle of the new Basilica. The death of his patron, Pope Alexander VII, put a halt to Bernini's work. The third set of columns was abandoned, and Bernini's piazza remained open-ended and incomplete. From the final major reconstruction of Borgo in the 15th century, the site which the Via della Conciliazione now covers remained occupied by residential, religious, and historical buildings for nearly 500 years. The final impetus behind the road's construction was primarily political. Borgo, along with the rest of the Papal States outside of the Vatican itself, was taken by the Kingdom of Italy during the Italian unification in the 19th Century - leading to Pope Pius IX's declaration that he had become a prisoner in the Vatican and the formation of the Roman Question. For the next 59 years, the Popes refused to leave the Vatican, in order to avoid any appearance of accepting the authority wielded by the Italian government over Rome as a whole. Initially, parts of the Italian government welcomed this, expecting the influence of the Papacy to fade to the point that enough political support could be gained to abolish it altogether. However, this failed to come to pass, and eventually a compromise acceptable to both states was reached in the Lateran treaty of 1929. Mussolini and Rome Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, who had signed the accord on behalf of the King, resurrected the idea of a grand thoroughfare symbolically connecting the Vatican to the heart of the Italian capital. To fulfil this vision, Mussolini turned to the prominent Fascist architects Marcello Piacentini and Attilio Spaccarelli. Drawing inspiration from a number of the designs submitted by Carlo Fontana, Piacentini came up with a plan that would preserve the best aspects of both the \\"open\\" and \\"closed\\" designs - a grand boulevard that would nonetheless obscure the majority of the Vatican buildings per Bernini's intentions. The vast colonnaded street would require the clearance of the whole \\"spina\\" of Borgo placed in between the Basilica and the Castle. Since the facades of the buildings lining this space did not align perfectly, in order to create the illusion of a perfectly straight causeway traffic islands would be erected along both sides, with rows of obelisks leading towards the Square, doubling as lampposts. These were also intended to reduce the effect that the funnel-shaped design would have on perspective when facing the Basilica. The wings of those buildings closest to the square would be preserved to form a propylaea, blocking the greater portion of the Vatican City from approaching visitors and framing the Square and Basilica at the head of a grand open space that would allow for easy vehicular access.McClendon, pp. 38‚Äì39 Construction Demolition of the spina of Borgo began with Mussolini's symbolic strike of the first building with a pickaxe on 29 October 1936 and continued for twelve months. Even at the time, the demolition proved controversial, with many Borgo residents displaced en masse to settlements (\\"borgate\\") outside of the city.Kirk, p. 9. Among the buildings dismantled, either totally or in part, and rebuilt in another position, were the Palazzo dei Convertendi, the house of Giacomo Bartolomeo da Brescia, the Church of the Nunziatina, the palaces Rusticucci-Accoramboni and degli Alicorni (the latter had been already demolished in 1931). Other buildings, like the palace of the Governatore di Borgo and the Churches of San Giacomo Scossacavalli and Sant'Angelo al Corridore, were destroyed. Facing into the cleared area are five other historical buildings, the Palazzo Giraud Torlonia, the church of Santa Maria in Traspontina, the Palazzo dei Penitenzieri, Palazzo Serristori, and Palazzo Cesi (which was mutilated).Kirk, p. 16. The construction of the road was only a small feature in the reconstruction of Rome ordered by Mussolini, which ranged from the restoration of the Castel Sant'Angelo, the clearance of the Mausoleum of Augustus, to the vastly more complicated site of the Via dell'Impero through Rome's ancient imperial remains. His plan was to transform Rome into a monument to Italian fascism. Crowds spilling into the Via della Conciliazione during the funeral of Pope John Paul II. Construction of the road continued long after Mussolini's death and the abolition of Italian Fascism. The obelisks along the road were installed in time for the Jubilee of 1950. Today Via della conciliazione at night. Since its completion, the road has acted as the primary access point to St. Peter's Square, and by extension to the Vatican City itself.

The attraction features nostalgic train rides that are usually themed, such as the Easter Bunny Express, North Pole Express, and rides with favorite children's characters including Thomas the Tank Engine and Clifford the Big Red Dog. Route history The train operates on approximately of track between Lebanon, Mason and Monroe ‚Äì all cities in southwestern Ohio. For most trips the LM&M; runs south from Lebanon Station in downtown historic Lebanon to Hageman Junction. The train runs along the right-of-way of the Cincinnati, Lebanon and Northern Railway (CL&N;), a historic passenger and freight line that began operation in 1881 with narrow gauge track ( between the rails). Three years later it was rebuilt to standard gauge. The CL&N; was later acquired by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) that operated both freight and passenger trains over the line between Dayton and Cincinnati. The passenger service over this line was primarily commuter trains that took people who lived in Warren County to jobs in Blue Ash, Norwood, Cincinnati and Dayton. The PRR discontinued Cincinnati passenger service over this line in 1931 after the opening of Cincinnati Union Terminal. Continuity of the original right-of-way between Lebanon and Cincinnati was broken when interstate highway I-71 was constructed during the 1960s. Segments of the original CL&N;/PRR trackage are still in operation as of 2008. The LM&M;‚Äôs track from Lebanon to Hageman Junction is currently owned by the city of Lebanon and Genesee & Wyoming (current owner of the Indiana and Ohio Railway) owns the remaining track. While the I&O; continues to operate freight over the entire line, the LM&M; has trackage rights to operate passenger trains. Motive power Locomotive CRC 55 is the oldest GP7 locomotive in continuous operation in the United States of America. The locomotive was ordered from General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) in 1947 by the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) for service on the former Pere Marquette Railway territory in Michigan. The locomotive‚Äôs original number was 5704, and it ran in general freight service all over the C&O;, and subsequently the Chessie System, until it was retired, then purchased by the Indiana and Ohio Railway (I&O;) around 1987. Ownership of 55 was transferred to what is now the LM&M; when the I&O; was purchased by RailTex in 1996. The locomotive was built in May 1950 and was ballasted to ., making it and its sisters the heaviest GP7s on the C&O.; A conservative estimate is that the 55 has traveled well over 3 million miles to date. In 2018, the CRC 55 was re- painted into its as-delivered Chesapeake and Ohio paint scheme in blue-and- yellow. Coaches=CRC 101 - 104 The four open-window commuter coaches built in 1930 by the Pullman Company in Chicago, and by the Harlan and Hollingsworth division of Bethlehem Shipbuilding for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W;). These coaches did not require a locomotive because each car was self-propelled by four 3000 Volt DC, electric motors receiving electricity from overhead catenary wires. Though each car was equipped with individual engineer‚Äôs controls, two or more cars could be coupled together as a train and operated by a single engineer in the lead car. The coaches operated in commuter service in the eastern New Jersey suburbs of New York City. for the (DL&W;) Railroad until 1960, when the Lackawanna Railroad was merged with the Erie Railroad to form the Erie Lackawanna (EL) and continued to serve until 1976, and finally New Jersey Transit (NJT) until 1984, when they were purchased for use in Lebanon. At that time the cars were named after historic and significant places along the current LM&M; line: Car 101, \\"Mason\\"; 102 \\"Hageman\\"; and 103 \\"Turtle Creek\\" each hold 72 passengers, and Car 104 \\"Lebanon\\" holds 54 passengers and features a snack bar. Lebanon railroad station Built in 1972 as a replica of the original Lebanon Victorian-style passenger station and owned and maintained by the Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs. The land was purchased from the Penn Central Railroad and the Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs raised funds to build a membership facility on the property. The garden club members use the station as a library, meeting rooms, workshop space and memorabilia displays. The LM&M; ticket office and gift shop is located across the street at the corner of South and Mechanic. Crossing watchman‚Äôs tower The Lebanon Council of Garden Clubs secured a tower originally in service at the corner of Reading and Columbia Roads in Reading, Ohio. Before the introduction of automatic crossing gates, the gates were often operated manually by a crossing guard located in a tower that provided him a better view of oncoming trains and vehicular traffic. The tower was equipped with a coal stove, chair, and crossing gate controls. Semaphore signal The origin of the semaphore at Lebanon Station parking lot is unknown; however it is representative of a typical train order semaphore, which was used to convey different messages to an approaching train by changing the positioning of the arm. The train order signal had three color and blade positions, Green (vertical) indicating no orders, Yellow (diagonal 45 degrees) indicating pick up orders while moving, and Red (horizontal) indicating stop and sign for orders after reading them as verification with the block operator, who controlled the signal. The signal was built by the Union Switch and Signal of Swissvale Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. It is a donation from the Lebanon Kiwanis Club.

Early life De Young was born in St. Louis, Missouri. The family was Jewish, but the family history is murky. Michael in later years claimed that his father was a Baltimore banker of French origin, but he may have been a peripatetic jeweler and dry-goods merchant named De Jong or De Jongh. Michael was the son of Cornelia \\"Amelia\\" (n√©e Morange; 1809‚Äì1881) and, supposedly, Miechel de Young (d. 1854), who married in 1837. His maternal grandfather, Benjamin Morange, who served as the French Minister to Spain under Napoleon I, The Hebrews in America moved to the United States about 1815 and helped found the B'nai Jeshurun Congregation in New York in 1825. The de Young family moved from St. Louis to San Francisco in 1854. M.H. de Young's father was said to have died of a stroke during the journey. M.H. de Young attended and graduated from Heald College, a San Francisco college founded in 1863. Career= News  In San Francisco, de Young and his brother, Charles de Young (1846‚Äì1880), founded the Daily Dramatic Chronicle newspaper, first published on January 17, 1865, with the loan of a twenty dollar gold piece which Michael received from his landlord. A third brother, Gustavus, whose initial originally appeared in the masthead (\\"G. and C. de Young\\"), later vanished. The Daily Dramatic Chronicle was a four-page tabloid that was freely distributed throughout San Francisco. According to the de Youngs, the Daily Dramatic Chronicle would be \\"the best advertising medium on the Pacific Coast.\\" On September 1, 1868, the de Youngs expanded their tabloid into a daily newspaper. The first issue stated that the Chronicle would be \\"independent in all things, neutral in none.\\" The Daily Dramatic Chronicle was sold under the condition that it be renamed the Dramatic Review. De Young was also the director of the Associated Press for many years.  Public Leadership  De Young, inspired by the events of the Chicago World's fair, led a campaign to bring a world's fair to San Francisco. De Young then became the Director-General of the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. During a visit to New York City, De Young was inspired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art's location in Central Park. As a result, de Young wanted the fair to be held in Golden Gate Park. However, John McLaren, the Superintendent of Golden Gate Park, was concerned about how the removal of many trees would affect the environment of the park. In a intense debate, de Young asked McLaren, \\"What is a tree? \\"What are a thousand trees compared to the benefits of the exposition?\\" Significantly, de Young owned about 31 blocks south of the park and could have been motivated by the fair's potential positive impacts on his real estate holdings. While the vast majority of the fair's buildings were destroyed, de Young persuaded the city to save the Fine Arts Building. The building was renamed the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum after de Young's death. De Young supported the museum throughout his life and bequeathed $150,000 to the museum upon his death. Personal life De Young and his wife Katherine had five children: *Charles de Young (1881‚Äì1913) *Helen de Young (1883‚Äì1969), who married George T. Cameron (1873‚Äì1955) *Constance Marie de Young (1885‚Äì1968), who married Joseph Oliver Tobin (1878‚Äì1978) *Kathleen Yvonne de Young (1888‚Äì1954), who married Ferdinand Thieriot (1883‚Äì1920) *Phyllis D. de Young (1892‚Äì1988), who married Nion Robert Tucker (1885‚Äì1950) In 1884, he was shot by an irate businessman, Adolph B. Spreckels, apparently due to a negative newspaper article, but survived. M. H. de Young died on February 15, 1925 and a Catholic church mass was held in St. Mary's Cathedral (he had converted to Catholicism after marrying his wife, Katherine I. Deane). Legacy The M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, is named in his honor. According to his daughter Helen de Young Cameron, de Young \\"loved objects. He was an incurable collector. He collected everything. He stored his collections at the Memorial Museum, where he would visit them at all hours. He took genuine delight in sharing them with the citizens of San Francisco, insisting that his museum never charge admission.\\" De Young purchased many things of \\"curious and artistic and instructive value\\" for the museum.The Mineral Collector.

The site of new Ierissos is visible in the valley in the background, still given to agricultural uses. View of Ierissos showing the Akanthos site in the foreground and to the extreme right. Akanthos (; ) was an ancient Greek city on the Athos peninsula, on the narrow neck of land between the sacred mountain and the mainland, to the northwest of the Xerxes Canal. It was founded in the 7th century BCE as a colony of Andros, itself a colony of Chalcis in Euboea. Chalcidice was multi-cultural. The archaeology of the region suggests that some Hellenes were already there. The site is on the north-east side of Akti, on the most eastern peninsula of Chalcidice.Strabo and Ptolemy erroneously place Akanthos on the Singitic Gulf, but there can be no doubt that the town was on the Strymonian Gulf, as is stated by Herodotus and other authorities. The error may have perhaps arisen from the territory of Akanthos having stretched as far as the Singitic Gulf (Smith). The ancient city extended along a ridge comprising three hills bordering the south-east of modern Ierissos about from it. The ridge dominates the landscape. It is terminated on the north by the coastal road (Vasileos Konstantinou) and the beach between Ierissos and its harbor. The modern city is about equal in size to the ancient site, which is now partially wooded. Remains of an high circuit wall, a citadel, and Hellenistic buildings are visible embedded in the terrain, along with a deserted Byzantine church and two post Byzantine churches. The name selected for the colony is a phytoname, the name of a plant. The plant would most likely be Acanthus mollis, which abounds on the Mediterranean rocky coasts. Pomponius Mela says that it grew on the coast between the River Strymon and Athos. The plant, a thorny, flowering perennial, was known for its medicinal powers. It is the model for the plant design used on Corinthian capitals. The prosperous and successful city in the course of time became a part of the Byzantine Empire. In the 6th century CE the empire declined due to devastation of its population by plague, starting about 541. The peninsula was abandoned by the Hellenes only to be gradually repopulated by Slavs. In the 9th century the Byzantines recovered and reoccupied the peninsula, bringing in Hellenes and Armenians from Asia Minor. They were protected in Roman-style fortified towns called kastra. One of these was Erissos, placed over the site of Akanthos. After it became the site of a Bishopric, Erissos was changed to Ierissos by analogy with Hieros, \\"sacred.\\" There is an etymology for Erissos as follows. The Marble of Ladiava, an inscription from Ierissos, reports the presence of a large community of Roman merchants, 27 BCE‚Äì14 CE. They chose to call Akanthos, etymologically \\"spiny,\\" Echinia, \\"hedgehog.\\" In the course of time Echinia came to mean \\"sea urchin,\\" which also is spiny. The Roman colony disappeared along with the Greek city in the 6th century. When the Byzantines returned they chose the Latin form of the word, Ericius, which became Erissos by palatalization of the \\"c.\\" In 1430 Thessaloniki fell to Murad II, bringing Macedonia finally under the Ottoman Empire. Before then it had changed hands among the Ottomans, the Byzantines, and the Republic of Venice, since the late 14th century. The native population fleeing the city were pursued and brought back by the Turkish army. Subsequently, the city was augmented by the forced transplantation of Yuruk tribesmen from Anatolia, semi-nomads who kept sheep, practicing transhumance over the grasslands of Halkidiki, The region had been gradually deforested during the Byzantine era. The Ottoman rulers left Halkidiki in the hands of the monastic communities of Athos, whom they encouraged and allowed to rule. Despite vigorous revolutionary activity in the Greek War of Independence of 1821, Macedonia, of which Halkidiki was a part, was forced to remain under the empire. In 1912 the Kingdom of Greece combined with other Balkan states to liberate Macedonia from Ottoman rule in the Balkan Wars. Macedonia was then divided among the victors, Greece receiving south Macedonia, with Thessaloniki and Halkidiki. In 1922 the Turkish people abolished the empire in favor of the Turkish Republic. In the 1923 population exchange consequent on the border settlement with Greece, Ierissos received an influx of Anatolian Greeks. In 1932 a major earthquake devastated the village beyond re-use. It became \\"old Ierissos\\" as opposed to \\"new Ierissos\\" subsequently constructed in the valley below the hill. Unknown to the builders, the valley floor is the site of an ancient cemetery in use since before the founding of Akanthos, not abandoned until the 17th century CE. The new Ierissos is a flourishing city, architecturally in the style of the 1930s. The municipal arrangements of modern Greece have changed a number of times since then. More recently, the fact that Stagira, named for ancient Stagira, is in the vicinity stimulated the creation of the municipality, Stagira-Akanthos. In 2011 the name was changed to Aristotelis in honor of the Stagirite philosopher, Aristotle. Archaeology=Archaeological services in Macedonia The Akanthos site and monuments are officially known (in English translation) as the Archaeological Site of Akanthos (see the website given in the box). Excavation and administration (archaeological services) are conducted by, and are under the authority of, the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports through its departments. Currently (2018) the relevant departments, or ephorates, are under the Directorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, which is under the General Directorate of Antiquities and Cultural Heritage, which is under the General Secretary of Culture, which is under the Minister of Culture and Sports. The department with the responsibility of guidance and oversight of the site is the Ephorate of Antiquity of Chalcidice and Mount Athos, which has a list of responsibilities including the monasteries, and the sites of Akanthos, Olynthos, and Stageira. These assignments supersede previous arrangements, which might be cited in literature and on the Internet, such as 16th Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, Thessaloniki, which is no more. The archaeological ephorates of Macedonia began in the Balkan Wars, starting in 1912. There was already considerable international interest in the antiquities of Macedonia. The Ottoman Empire was supporting some rescue archaeology. For example, when an earthquake caused an opening to appear in a tumulus at Derveni, suggesting the impending collapse of a structure underneath, the Ottomans assigned Makridi Bey (Bey is a Turkish title), ethnically an Ottoman Greek, Theodoros Makridis, who had been at Hattusas, to excavate it. He never got a chance to finish it. In 1912 a Greek expeditionary army entered Macedonia. Among them were volunteers who were Greek archaeologists. With the approval of the army, they took over all archaeology in Macedonia, collecting and storing ancient items, surveying sites, and doing preliminary excavation, with the assistance of other Greek soldiers. The new Governor-General of Macedonia created the first official Archaeological Service. The General Staff of the Army began to automatically assign soldier- archaeologists to it. On November 9, 1912, the office of Ephor of Antiquities of Thessaloniki was created, with George Oikonomou as ephor. He was also head of the Archaeological Service. Gradually additional ephorates were created, which were numbered, 2nd, 3rd, etc., using capital Greek letters for numbers. Each of the ephorates required a museum to house its artifacts. The number of ancient sites to be protected and investigated is very large; the budget never seemed to be large enough, and there were never enough archaeologists to go around. The Archaeological Service accepted assistance from foreign institutions. A French mission had done some excavation for research under the Ottomans. French soldiers in Thessaloniki were glad to assist. The French Archaeological School of Athens had been formed and was active. Johns Hopkins and New York University undertook excavations. The Greek Archaeological Society of Athens and the University of Thessaloniki took a hand. By 1996 there were 25 ephorates of Prehistoric and Classical Archaeology in addition to others on related topics. In 2003 the ephorates were organized into eight directorates. The names and responsibilities of the ephorates require frequent adjustment to support the expanding archaeological investment. The names and numbers of museums also change frequently. Currently many of the artifacts from Halkidiki in general and Ierissos in particular are on display at the Archaeological Museum of Polygyros. Others are to be found in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki. Background to Chalcidic settlement Chalcidice has been occupied since the Palaeolithic, the beginning of human culture, which started at about 3.3 MYA (million years ago). Whether it was continuous occupation for that length of time is not answered by the evidence, which is intermittent. Whether the intermittency belongs to the evidence or to the habitation is not yet known. The major find site for the Palaeolithic is Petralona Cave, where the Petralona Skull was found, from a fully human Hominid believed to be ancestral (or close to it) to both modern and Neanderthal men. The date is the Middle Pleistocene (700,000‚Äì128,000 BP, or \\"before present\\"). Some assign it to the later Middle Pleistocene, 200,000‚Äì150,000 BCE, but a carbon date on the ashes of a fire yields 700,000 BCE. The fire is the earliest known one of human origin. Mesolithic culture also is present. The Middle and Late Neolithic (5500‚Äì3000 BCE) are represented at sites near rivers. In the Bronze Age (3000‚Äì1100) site density increased. The sites have the form of tells, or mounds, which in this case result from the construction of successive mud-brick and wood houses over the same site. These are at seaside locations. The dead were deposited in distinct cemeteries, whether in burials or cremation urns. There is no evidence of ethnicity. History begins in the Early Iron Age (1100‚Äì900 BCE). ThucydidesBook IV Chapter 120 mentions that, on the way home from Troy, a contingent from Pellene in Achaea of the Peloponnesus, driven to Chalcidice by a storm, deciding to stay, founded Skione, according to the Skionians, he says. The date is debatable, but if Troy fell in 1180 BCE, it would have been in the 12th century BCE. This is the first report of Hellenes in Chalcidice. The settlements of the period are on fortified heights (acropoli), whether on the coast or in the interior. The culture shows affinities to that of southern Greece. According to other sources, Chalcidice was also occupied by tribes of Thrace and other people of unknown language driven from Macedon by the Macedonians moving in. The Akanthos site After 1912 the fact that the Akanthos site was occupied by an inhabited village endowed it with a low archaeological priority. After 1932, the hills were open, but there was still little interest in improving the priority. In 1973 the priority changed suddenly with the discovery of the cemetery. A bulldozer preparing a site for new construction broke into a number of sarcophagi and shattered some pottery. Immediately the archaeological ephorate issued a non-development order, which it had the power to do, being a government agency, and conducted rescue archaeology on an emergency basis. This was the beginning of a systematic excavation that continues today, with no end in sight. The rescue archaeology soon extended over a large number of graves. The total is not known for sure. Numbers vary from a mere 600 to as many as 60,000. Part of the problem is that over such a length of time graves were destroyed to make way for others, or were placed over others. A few general observations can be made. The earliest cemetery was placed further inland near the center of Ierissos, while the later were more toward the sea., and were aligned pointing to sea. Currently a number of chronological work areas are distinguished, the two main ones being the cemetery of Akanthos, and the medieval cemetery of Ierissos, discovered in 1984. The first contains tombs ranging in time from the Proto-Geometric Period through the abandonment, with the most from the classical centuries, the 5th and 4th BCE. The second contains the graves of mediaeval Ierissos, from the founding of the Kolovou Monastery on the hill in 883 CE, which made use of Greek and Slavic texts, to the 12th century CE, judging by the coins. The fact that some coins date from the 6th century suggests that the site was not entirely abandoned. The graves are not spectacular find sites, compared to the tombs of chieftains, or monumental architecture, or hidden treasures of precious metals. The ordinary people were buried there in a variety of coffins or ash containers. Women and children predominated. Grave goods were abundant: favorite objects broken to kill them, the abundance and quality being indicative of the wealth and status of the deceased, as is usually the case. The clay figurines are especially revealing of life in the city. Of the greatest value archaeologically is the pottery, of which the shape and decoration typically fall into known types providing relatively certain chronological sequences and connections with other parts of Greece, Asia and Europe. The similarity of the ceramics to that of Corinth, east Greece, Thasos, Attica, and the Cyclades, along with the coins minted in Akanthos, are generally interpreted that the prosperity of Akanthos derived from its commercialism, which its strategic location supported. History Chalcidice Peninsula Foundation It was founded by 7th century BC (the archaeology suggests 655 BC) by colonists from Andros, according to Thucydides.Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, 4.84. Plutarch, on the other hand, referred to it as a mixed colony of Andrians and local Chalcidians, which was founded on the \\"Coast of Drakontos\\", in place of a preexisting civilization. He writes that settlers from Andros and Chalcis arrived on the shore at the same time. The natives of Acanthus, seeing the crowd of settlers, became frightened and left the city. The settlers sent an explorer each to see what had happened and, as they approached the city and realized it was empty, ran to be the first to take over the land for their fellow countrymen. The Chalcidian was the fastest but the Andrian, seeing he was losing, stopped and threw his spear on the wall's gate, before his opponent arrived. A court case followed, which was won by the Andrians, because as they protested, they had just about taken over the city first. Archaic period Its growth during the Archaic period is reflected by the wide circulation of its currency, first minted around 530 BCE with the distinctive emblem of a lion killing a bull‚Äîperhaps linked to Herodotus‚Äôs account (vii. 125) that on the march of Xerxes from Acanthus to Therma, lions seized the camels which carried the provisions‚Äîat least 92 different types of coins have been found. Its economic resources emanated from the mining and wood from the nearby forests, but also through agricultural and vegetable goods that were transported through the sizable harbor. Coin of Akanthos with lion attacking a bull, Macedon. Circa 500‚Äì480 BCE The first historical reference, in Thuycidides, from mid-5th century BC, connects the city with the Persian Wars, during which the townsfolk officially welcomed the Persians and willingly helped with the digging of the canal for Xerxes, 480 BC, for which Xerxes richly rewarded them. They declared one of his relatives who died in the area, named Artahei, a hero, and willingly took part in the expedition against Greece. Classical period After the Persian wars Acanthus became a member of the Athenian Alliance, paying tribute of three talents. In 424 BCE, after a short siege and oratory by Brasidas, the city was convinced to ally itself with the Spartans, although Thucydides remarks the greater likelihood that it was the threat to destroy their profitable vineyards, rather than Brasidas's rhetoric, that truly moved the Acanthians.Thucydides. History of the Peloponnesian War, 4.85‚Äì8. Coin of Akanthos, Macedon. Circa 470‚Äì430 BCE Coin of Akanthos, Macedon. Circa 470‚Äì390 BCE In the initial phase of the establishment of the Chalcidice League, it was mainly smaller towns and cities in Macedonia that were enrolled. Only when it was firmly established was an offer made to Acanthus. When this was refuse a second offer was made but with the threat that force would be used should Acanthus refuse to join the federation.HISTORY OF GREECE, G Grote vol. 9 p. 45 The townsfolk refused to join it, in part due to the old quarrel with the Chalcidians.Xenophon. Hellenica, 5.2.11. Under threat from the Chalcidians, Acanthus called in Sparta's help, which came in 382 BC when the Spartans and Acanthians captured and destroyed Olynthos and the alliance, at least temporarily. Acanthus's staying-out of the alliance meant that in 350 BC, when it was conquered by Philip II of Macedon, it was not destroyed. Later it was incorporated to the region of Ouranoupolis, a new city that was founded by Alexarchos (Cassander's brother), in the isthmus, between the Strymoinan and the Singitic gulfs. Hellenistic Period According to Livy, Acanthus was attacked by a Roman-Pergamene fleet in 199 BC during the Second Macedonian War and then besieged, captured and sacked by Rome in 168 BC.Livy, 31.45.16. Roman period The Romans later exploited all the natural sources of wealth and its harbor, and the town continued through the Roman and Byzantine period. In Roman times is attested epigraphically the existence of a Roman community attracted mainly by the rich mines of this region D.

ANT is the most abundant protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane and belongs to mitochondrial carrier family. Free ADP is transported from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix, while ATP produced from oxidative phosphorylation is transported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytoplasm, thus providing the cells with its main energy currency. ADP/ATP translocases are exclusive to eukaryotes and are thought to have evolved during eukaryogenesis. Human cells express four ADP/ATP translocases: SLC25A4, SLC25A5, SLC25A6 and SLC25A31, which constitute more than 10% of the protein in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These proteins are classified under the mitochondrial carrier superfamily.  Types  In humans, there exist three paraologous ANT isoforms: * SLC25A4 ‚Äì found primarily in heart and skeletal muscle * SLC25A5 ‚Äì primarily expressed in fibroblasts * SLC25A6 ‚Äì primarily express in liver  Structure  A side view of the translocase spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane. The six Œ±-helices are denoted by different colors. The binding pocket is currently open to the cytoplasmic side and will bind to ADP, transporting it into the matrix. (From ) The translocase (as a molecular surface, green) viewed from both sides of a lipid bilayer representing the inner mitocondrial membrane. Left panel (IM): view from the intermembrane space. The protein is in the open conformation towards this side. Right panel (M): view from the matrix. The protein is closed towards this side. ANT has long been thought to function as a homodimer, but this concept was challenged by the projection structure of the yeast Aac3p solved by electron crystallography, which showed that the protein was three-fold symmetric and monomeric, with the translocation pathway for the substrate through the centre. The atomic structure of the bovine ANT confirmed this notion, and provided the first structural fold of a mitochondrial carrier. Further work has demonstrated that ANT is a monomer in detergents and functions as a monomer in mitochondrial membranes. ADP/ATP translocase 1 is the major AAC in human cells and the archetypal protein of this family. It has a mass of approximately 30 kDa, consisting of 297 residues. It forms six transmembrane Œ±-helices that form a barrel that results in a deep cone-shaped depression accessible from the outside where the substrate binds. The binding pocket, conserved throughout most isoforms, mostly consists of basic residues that allow for strong binding to ATP or ADP and has a maximal diameter of 20 √Ö and a depth of 30 √Ö. Indeed, arginine residues 96, 204, 252, 253, and 294, as well as lysine 38, have been shown to be essential for transporter activity.  Function  ADP/ATP translocase transports ATP synthesized from oxidative phosphorylation into the cytoplasm, where it can be used as the principal energy currency of the cell to power thermodynamically unfavorable reactions. After the consequent hydrolysis of ATP into ADP, ADP is transported back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it can be rephosphorylated to ATP. Because a human typically exchanges the equivalent of his/her own mass of ATP on a daily basis, ADP/ATP translocase is an important transporter protein with major metabolic implications. ANT transports the free, i.e. deprotonated, non- Magnesium, non-Calcium bound forms of ADP and ATP, in a 1:1 ratio. Transport is fully reversible, and its directionality is governed by the concentrations of its substrates (ADP and ATP inside and outside mitochondria), the chelators of the adenine nucleotides, and the mitochondrial membrane potential. The relationship of these parameters can be expressed by an equation solving for the 'reversal potential of the ANT\\" (Erev_ANT), a value of the mitochondrial membrane potential at which no net transport of adenine nucleotides takes place by the ANT. The ANT and the F0-F1 ATP synthase are not necessarily in directional synchrony. Apart from exchange of ADP and ATP across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the ANT also exhibits an intrinsic uncoupling activity ANT is an important modulatory and possible structural component of the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore, a channel involved in various pathologies whose function still remains elusive. Karch et al. propose a \\"multi-pore model\\" in which ANT is at least one of the molecular components of the pore.Karch J, Bround MJ, Khalil H, et al. Inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition by deletion of the ANT family and CypD. Sci Adv. 2019;5(8):eaaw4597. Published 2019 Aug 28. doi:10.1126/sciadv.aaw4597 Translocase mechanism Under normal conditions, ATP and ADP cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane due to their high negative charges, but ADP/ATP translocase, an antiporter, couples the transport of the two molecules. The depression in ADP/ATP translocase alternatively faces the matrix and the cytoplasmic sides of the membrane. ADP in the intermembrane space, coming from the cytoplasm, binds the translocase and induces its eversion, resulting in the release of ADP into the matrix. Binding of ATP from the matrix induces eversion and results in the release of ATP into the intermembrane space, subsequently diffusing to the cytoplasm, and concomitantly brings the translocase back to its original conformation. ATP and ADP are the only natural nucleotides recognized by the translocase. The net process is denoted by: :ADP3‚àícytoplasm \\\\+ ATP4‚àímatrix ‚Üí ADP3‚àímatrix \\\\+ ATP4‚àícytoplasm ADP/ATP exchange is energetically expensive: about 25% of the energy yielded from electron transfer by aerobic respiration, or one hydrogen ion, is consumed to regenerate the membrane potential that is tapped by ADP/ATP translocase. The translocator cycles between two states, called the cytoplasmic and matrix state, opening up to these compartments in an alternating way. There are structures available that show the translocator locked in a cytoplasmic state by the inhibitor carboxyatractyloside, or in the matrix state by the inhibitor bongkrekic acid. Alterations Rare but severe diseases such as mitochondrial myopathies are associated with dysfunctional human ADP/ATP translocase. Mitochondrial myopathies (MM) refer to a group of clinically and biochemically heterogeneous disorders that share common features of major mitochondrial structural abnormalities in skeletal muscle. The major morphological hallmark of MM is ragged, red fibers containing peripheral and intermyofibrillar accumulations of abnormal mitochondria. In particular, autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) is a common disorder associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase and can induce paralysis of muscles responsible for eye movements. General symptoms are not limited to the eyes and can include exercise intolerance, muscle weakness, hearing deficit, and more. adPEO shows Mendelian inheritance patterns but is characterized by large-scale mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletions. mtDNA contains few introns, or non-coding regions of DNA, which increases the likelihood of deleterious mutations. Thus, any modification of ADP/ATP translocase mtDNA can lead to a dysfunctional transporter, particularly residues involved in the binding pocket which will compromise translocase efficacy. MM is commonly associated with dysfunctional ADP/ATP translocase, but MM can be induced through many different mitochondrial abnormalities. Inhibition Bongkrekic acid ADP/ATP translocase is very specifically inhibited by two families of compounds. The first family, which includes atractyloside (ATR) and carboxyatractyloside (CATR), binds to the ADP/ATP translocase from the cytoplasmic side, locking it in a cytoplasmic side open conformation. In contrast, the second family, which includes bongkrekic acid (BA) and isobongkrekic acid (isoBA), binds the translocase from the matrix, locking it in a matrix side open conformation. The negatively charged groups of the inhibitors bind strongly to the positively charged residues deep within the binding pocket. The high affinity (Kd in the nanomolar range) makes each inhibitor a deadly poison by obstructing cellular respiration/energy transfer to the rest of the cell. There are structures available that show the translocator locked in a cytoplasmic state by the inhibitor carboxyatractyloside, or in the matrix state by the inhibitor bongkrekic acid. History In 1955, Siekevitz and Potter demonstrated that adenine nucleotides were distributed in cells in two pools located in the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments. Shortly thereafter, Pressman hypothesized that the two pools could exchange nucleotides. However, the existence of an ADP/ATP transporter was not postulated until 1964 when Bruni et al. uncovered an inhibitory effect of atractyloside on the energy-transfer system (oxidative phosphorylation) and ADP binding sites of rat liver mitochondria. Soon after, an overwhelming amount of research was done in proving the existence and elucidating the link between ADP/ATP translocase and energy transport. cDNA of ADP/ATP translocase was sequenced for bovine in 1982 and a yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 1986 before finally Battini et al. sequenced a cDNA clone of the human transporter in 1989. The homology in the coding sequences between human and yeast ADP/ATP translocase was 47% while bovine and human sequences extended remarkable to 266 out of 297 residues, or 89.6%. In both cases, the most conserved residues lie in the ADP/ATP substrate binding pocket.

Life =Early life Julie Candeille described herself in her M√©moires as having \\"bright blonde hair, brown eyes, white, fine and clear skin, [and] a soft and laughing air\\". According to her colleague the actress , Candeille was pretty, with \\"a well- taken size, a noble gait, [and] traits and whiteness as held by creole women\\". Her ancestry was actually Flemish, with no known Creole elements, Candeille, like many women musicians of her time, came from a musical family. Her father Pierre-Joseph Candeille (1744‚Äì1827) was a composer, actor and low-bass opera- singer in the chorus, though he ended up exiled in Moulins where he became a theatre director.See Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis, Biographie universelle des musiciens Her father was her primary teacher, and some have speculated that his deeply invested interest in his daughter's education was an effort to bolster his career. Candeille developed her natural talents for song and harpsichord and performed extensively while still a child in chamber orchestras. Aged 7 she played in a concert before the French king and she was said to have played a concert alongside the teenage Mozart. By the age of 13 she had performed in public as a singer, pianist and harpist. Aged 14, she was initiated into the \\"La Candeur\\" masonic lodge, in which she met several playwrights such as Olympe de Gouges and other influential figures who favoured her artistic career in Parisian society and the intrigues of the dying ancien r√©gime. In her M√©moires, she records how she benefitted from protection by powerful figures such as the marquis de Louvois (an anti- establishment aristocrat and intimate friend of the chevalier de Champcenetz who was, like him, sent to the fort de Ham for misconduct), the music-loving duchesse de Villeroy (who led a mainly female salon whose influence also extended into the theatre), and the baron de Breteuil (minister of the king's household and possibly a lover of Candeille). Through the influence of her protectors, at the age of 15 she debuted at the Acad√©mie royale de Musique on 27 December 1782 in the title role of Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Aulide, in which she had only moderate success. At 16 Candeille made her fortepiano debut at the Concert Spirituel, where she performed a concerto by Clementi-‚Äìby this time she was also already composing sonatas, romances and airs for the harpsichord and piano, some of which have recently been rediscovered. Aged 17 she debuted a concerto that she composed. A reporter from the Mercure de France said: In order to support her family, Candeille returned to the stage. She did not have a voice which could challenge Mme Saint-Huberty in the opera (Saint-Huberty had succeeded Mlle Levasseur and Mlle Laguerre), so she returned to the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise on Monday 19 September 1785 as Hermione in Racine's Andromaque, receiving mixed reviews. During this time Mol√© was the protector of both Candeille and her friend Olympe de Gouge., M√©moires d'un pair de France, I, 197‚Äì201 Her strong personality and original ideas did not gain her friends and she was always held in low esteem by her colleagues in the Com√©die fran√ßaise such as Mol√©, Dazincourt, Fleury or Mlle Louise Contat, who regarded her just as one of the Versailles courtesans. Candeille joined Talma and those among his actors who welcomed the French Revolution in 1789. Playwright Candeille acting in Catherine ou la Belle fermi√®re on the stage of the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais in 1792 In 1789, she took the r√¥le of the young slave Mirza in L'heureux naufrage, a three-act play by Olympe de Gouges denouncing the living conditions of slaves in the French colonies. This play formed the pretext for a clash between the representatives of France's powerful colonial slave-owning lobby and the Amis des Noirs, a club co-founded by Brissot, Condorcet and abb√© Gr√©goire. After receiving mixed reviews on her performances for the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise she left the company in 1789 and traveled in the northern provinces. Candeille composed her first pieces of dramatic music during her travels. On her return to Paris, Julie Candeille was a star of the salons formed by the Amis des Noirs, and she is also known to have gone to the salons held by Mme de Lameth (also attended by Robespierre) and by Mme de Villette, Helv√©tius or Condorcet. It was during this era (1791) that Ad√©la√Øde Labille-Guiard, who shared Candeille's ideas, painted her portrait. The plays in which she advertised at the start of the Revolution had considerable success, such as those at the new Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s Amusantes on rue de Richelieu and at the Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique. The Revolution truly relaunched her career and she made several friends in advanced political circles. It is claimed that it was for her that Fabre d'√âglantine wrote his romance Je t'aime tant, set to music by Garat. In 1790 she returned to the stage, joining the Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique. In 1792, she participated in a festival held by Talma and his company at their home on the rue Chantereine in honour of general Dumouriez, victor of the battle of Valmy, at which Marat (at the head of a group of \\"√©nergum√®nes\\") loudly announced himself. Most of the guests (such as Antoine-Vincent Arnault or Pierre Victurnien Vergniaud) were denounced the following day in l'Ami du peuple. It is said that Julie Candeille was then the lover of Vergniaud, who had become a brilliant orator for the Girondins. Later in 1792 she debuted her most famous opera, the 3-act prose comedy Catherine, ou La belle fermi√®re, at the Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais. Candeille wrote the words and music for the opera and performed in the title role. First put on during the trial of Louis XVI, it was performed over 150 times in the next 35 years and received some international acclaim, prompting numerous editions of arrangements of the airs with harp or piano accompaniment. However, the opera was a success she was never able to duplicate ‚Äì none of the scores for her other comedic operas survive. Michaud, author of a famous biographical dictionary of his contemporaries, inferred under the restoration that Candeille had played the Goddess of Reason in Republican festivities.,At festivals given at Notre-Dame this r√¥le was played by Mlle Maillar de l'Op√©ra and by the wife of the bookseller Momoro. though she provided evidence to deny this.\\"La justification de Julie Candeille en r√©ponse √† Audiffret. Notice historique sur Julie Candeille\\" (extract from Michaud's Dictionnaire) However, the Goncourt brothers (not given to historical inaccuracies) support Michaud's charge. Compromised by her Girondin sympathies and too close to Vergniaud and other Girondins, in 1793 Julie Candeille was troubled by the authorities despite her popularity. She was the object of a denunciation and a search was ordered of her residence at rue Neuve des Mathurins, but thanks to the Montagnard deputy Julien de Toulouse (a member of the Committee of General Security) she managed to avoid being labelled a suspect and thus arrested.Julien de Toulouse, Encore un mot √†mes d√©tracteurs. Compte rendu de ma fortune, Paris, l'an III. \\"Citoyenne Simons\\" Once the Reign of Terror was over, on a whim she married the young doctor known as citizen Laroche, though she never took his name. The Directoire period saw her confirm her popularity as an actress and a playwright. Jacques-Antoine-Marie Lemoine's portrait of her was exhibited at the Paris Salon in year three, and at the Salon the following year a charming miniature by Mme Doucet de Suriny showing Candeille in a striped dress and red belt writing a new play was also exhibited. The play she was shown writing was her second opera, a slightly scandalous five-act verse comedy entitled La Bayad√®re ou le Fran√ßais √† Surate. This was written so as to give her the title role and was put on in January 1795, but was not as successful as she had hoped. Some critics had suggested that her success with Catherine had been a result of her father assisting in composition, and after a critical article in the Journal de Paris suggesting the same of La bayad√®re just after its debut, Candeille published a passionate response: Candeille ca. 1810, engraving by Coeur√© after Pierre-Paul Prud'hon In 1797, the actress √âlise Lange, old prot√©g√©e and friend of Julie Candeille, married the businessman Michel Simons, himself the son of a Belgian coach-builder whom Mlle Candeille had met in Brussels in August 1796, having gone to the Belgian capital to put on her opera Catherine ou la belle fermi√®re. Michel's father Jean Simons was not unfeeling to Candeille's charms and married her in Brussels on 11 February 1798 ‚Äì she divorced Laroche and broke a theatre engagement to marry him, thus ending her theatrical career. The new Madame Simons from then on lived in luxury in Brussels and Paris. Like many parvenus of that era, the couple wanted a petite maison, which they had built at great expense to designs by Bellanger at pointe Bellevue, on the former Mesdames estate.During this era Bellanger also built a house for Jean Simons and his wife Mlle Lange at la Chauvennerie, in the commune of Meudon, which also used an old royal estate It is said that she wanted to join her husband in his business activities and that she won him the commission to build Napoleon's carriage for his coronation via her friend Josephine (whom she had got to know in the salons)This carriage was a wonder of First French Empire technology and later came into the collection of Madame Tussauds in London, where it was destroyed in a fire in 1925. In 1803, Candeille and her former friend Mme Lejay, who had become comtesse de Pont√©coulant, were in charge of Brussels' welcome for Napoleon and his wife. When war resumed at the start of the First Empire, Jean Simons' business affairs declined and his wife retired to their Parisian h√¥tel particulier at 3 rue C√©rutti, giving piano recitals at aristocratic soir√©es in the French capital. She also became the beneficiary of a pension bestowed on her by the new empress Marie-Louise. Throughout her life Julie Candeille welcomed, supported and encouraged young people and other women musicians, dedicating many of her works to H√©l√®ne de Montgeroult and Pauline Duchambge. Her prot√©g√©s also included the young painter Girodet, with whom she had a wholly platonic liaison mainly conducted by letter. The adoptive son of doctor Trioson, Girodet became famous in 1793 for his Endymion, which put forward a newly aestheticised depiction of male anatomy. An undated drawing by Girodet shows him and Candeille in double profile ‚Äì she is hardly recognisable, having seemingly sacrificed her long blonde hair for an \\"√† la gar√ßonne\\" haircut before that phrase existed. She addressed passionate letters to him, more playing the role of an accomplice and friend than that of a transitory lover, since she was so much older than him. She signed herself \\"your dear old Galatea\\" (\\"Votre vieille Galath√©e\\") and offered him the chance to be her amorous intermediary, knowing as she did from Girodet's homo-erotic drawings that his tastes were for other men.Girodet produced a series of drawings on the death of Nisus and Euryalus in the Aeneid, a subtle glorification of heroic homosexuality.  Works =Literature Candeille was often criticized for her vanity, and her stage works received many unfavorable reviews in the Parisian papers. Candeille composed a total of 8 works for stage, only one of which (Catherine, ou La Belle fermi√®re) is extant. * Catherine, ou la Belle fermi√®re, Paris, year II. * La Bayad√®re, ou le Fran√ßais √† Surate, Paris, year III. * Ida, ou l'orpheline de Berlin, play in 3 acts. * Louise, ou la r√©conciliation. * Lydie, ou les mariages manqu√©s, Paris, 1809. * Bathilde, reine des Francs, Paris, 1814. * Vers sur la bont√©. * Justification de Julie Candeille en r√©ponse √† Audiffret. * Souvenirs de Brighton, Londres et Paris, Paris, 1818. * Agn√®s de France, ou le douzi√®me si√®cle, Paris, 1821. Music Contemporary discussions of her music highlight the supremacy of melody and use of simple harmonies used throughout her works. She composed in the style of Gr√©try, whom she greatly admired. Her works for keyboard, which she composed for her personal performances, are virtuosic ‚Äì her surviving musical works include a concerto for keyboard, three keyboard sonatas (some with violin accompaniment), and a duo for piano. Many other works are lost, including additional keyboard sonatas, duos, fantasias and variations. Modern editions of the concerto for keyboard, three arias and the overture from Catherine are available through Hildegard Publishing. * Three sonatas for harpsichord, with violin accompaniment. * Concerto for piano and strings. * Two great-sonatas for piano, opus 8 (under the name Julie Simons). * Fantaisie for piano (dedicated to Mme Rivi√®re). * Nocturne for piano (fantaisie n. 5, Op. 11).

This can reduce the amount of time spent on configuring, monitoring or troubleshooting a large network. The system will also allow network administrators to closely analyze the network. This system is installed in a central server that gathers data from RF devices from different brands and settings. The server can command a selected group of devices to apply given settings simultaneously.  Standardization  LWAPP was proposed by Airespace, as a standard protocol to provide interoperability among any brand of access point. Airespace was purchased by Cisco Systems. Its purpose was to standardize \\"lightweight\\" access points with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), but it was approved as a standard. Sponsored by Cisco Systems, it has been submitted to IETF in RFC 5412.RFC 5412, Lightweight Access Point Protocol, P. Calhoun, R. Suri, N. Cam-Winget, M. Williams, S. Hares, B. O'Hara, S. Kelly (February 2010) Although this protocol has so far not been popular beyond the Airespace/Cisco product lines, the CAPWAP standard is based on LWAPP. Support for LWAPP is also found in analysis products from AirMagnet, who has implemented a software based on this protocol to analyze Cisco wireless products. Still considered proprietary, LWAPP systems compete with other non- standard lightweight wireless mechanisms from companies like Meru Networks and Aruba Networks.  LWAPP Layer 2  On Layer 2, LWAPP only requires a data link connection in order to transfer frames and Layer 2 broadcasts. Even if IP connectivity is not established it will still operate at layer 2.  LWAPP Layer 3 and 4  Layer 4 UDP 12222 (data channel) and 12223 (control channel) connectivity must be established to work with this form of the protocol. Broadcasts or DHCP option 43 can be used to prime the access-points of the network. The controller must be on the same subnet if DHCP is not configured to handle layer 3 LWAPP provisioning. Another option for directing an AP to the controller is by defining the controller on the DNS server of the network.

It has been supplanted by Portuguese. Classification The Apiak√° language belongs to subgroup VI of the Tupi- Guarani languages. It is very close to Kagwahiva and may be a dialect of that language.Hammarstr√∂m (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices History After coming into contact with the Neo- Brazilians, the Apiaca language changed with combined elements of the Lingua Geral, A Tupi-based trade jargon. Today, Portuguese or Munduruku are more widely spoken as opposed to the Apiaca language, though these people have always been known by the name \\"Apiaca.\\" All the Apiac√° speak Portuguese and those married to members of the Munduruku and Kaiabi tribes speak their spouse's language fluently or have the ability to understand them fully. Although the Munduruku and Kaiabi languages and idioms are spoken on a day-to- day basis in the Apiaca villages, they are, however, limited to domestic spaces and informal conversations. The language used in formal conversations is Portuguese, due to contact with the Neo-Brazilians and Portuguese settlers. Although they cannot impose their own language on the co-resident Munduruku and Kaiabi people, due to such a small number of them who actually speak the Apiaca language, the Apiaca manage to impede the languages of these peoples from becoming the official languages in their villages. This allows Portuguese to function as an instrument of resistance employed by the Apiaca to prevent their cultural absorption by the Munduruku and Kaiabi tribes. Despite the linguistic proximity, the Apiak√° do not allow Kaiabi to be taught in their villages' schools, this stems from historically bad relations with this tribe, however, due to the better relationship the Apiaca have with the Munduruku people, they permit Munduruku teachers to give lessons in their own language. For many years the Apiaca have been attempting to revive their language through the schools in their villages but have so far been unsuccessful. In recent years there has been an initiative to create a book known as the \\"Apiaca Word\\" in order to catalog the language. Extinction The last fluent heritage speaker of Apiak√°, Pedrinho Kamassuri, died in hospital in Juara, Mato Grosso, on April 10, 2011. It is unknown how many partial speakers still live as of 2018.

It was culled from five notebooks spanning from 1956 to 1959, while Kerouac was fully absorbed by his studies of Buddhism and Buddhist philosophy. Kerouac initially experimented with Old Angel Midnight (then called \\"Lucien Midnight\\") in 1953 in his diary titled \\"1953. Notes again.\\" In entries dated from November 20 to December 3, 1953, he made notes on \\"Lucien Midnight\\" which was to be originally conceptualized in what he called \\"book movie\\" form, when he closed his eyes and projected onto paper a cinematic sense of what he heard. A bookmovie, he explained in Some of the Dharma, is a \\"prose concentration camera-eye visions of a definite movie of the mind with fade- ins, pans, close-ups, and fade-outs.\\" Kerouac's notes on Lucien Midnight were written while staying in the Lower East Side where he initially heard sounds coming through a tenement window from the wash court below. He then heard voices coming from kitchens of the other occupants in nearby apartment buildings and a man named Paddy arriving home drunk, and even a junky stirring in his bed. Kerouac conceptualized an idea of developing a work based on James Joyce‚Äôs experimental novel Finnegans Wake (not Ulysses as indicated by Ann Charters in her introduction to Old Angel Midnight for Grey Fox Press) where the ‚Äúsounds of the universe‚Äù became the chief ‚Äúplot‚Äù with all of its associated ‚Äúneologisms, mental associations, puns and wordmixes‚Äù that stewed a plethora of languages and ‚Äúnonlanguages.‚Äù Kerouac determinedly ‚Äúscribbled out in a strictly intuitional discipline at breakneck speed‚Äù the fledgling prose that would finally comprise the finished book for City Lights's Pocket Poet series eight years later. Kerouac's one dogma was to compose Lucien Midnight strictly in pencil by candlelight. Lucien Midnight differs from his sketching method of writing because it is based upon an aural experience, and not visual. The bookmovie approach was abandoned in 1953 in favor of a different approach he had stylistically achieved by 1956. In other notes from the time, Kerouac described Lucien Midnight as a \\"monolog of the world.\\" On March 1, 1957, while staying with William S. Burroughs in Tangiers, Kerouac worked on Lucien Midnight. Kerouac said of the poem: Kerouac began the first notebook on April 1, 1956. By now his spontaneous prose method had become second nature to him. Kerouac was staying with Gary Snyder in his Mill Valley cabin. Writing John Clellon Holmes on May 21, 1956, Kerouac explained his intentions: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what to write anymore, I‚Äôve been doodling with an endless automatic writing piece which raves on and on with no direction and no story and surely that wont do tho I‚Äôll finish it anyway while doing other things. Old Angel Midnight was first printed in Big Table 1, 1959. Big Table was a new magazine started by Paul Carrol and Irving Rosenthal published after the University of Chicago censored the student magazine, The Chicago Review. A \\"prose picnic\\" is what Judge Julius Hoffman called Kerouac's poem, in the ensuing trial of the Post Office vs. Big Table. To Kerouac, Old Angel Midnight was the only ‚Äúform in which I am allowed to say anything I want because not only I‚Äôve got to approximate the speed and content of mindflow naked word-babble,‚Äù but that it could give him to ‚Äúswim‚Äù with absolute freedom, ‚Äúdedicatedly crazed in the sea of that language.‚Äù Within the scope of that work, Kerouac envisioned the voices he heard discussing the ‚Äúlong weekend from Friday afternoon as it moves into Sunday night.‚Äù When he prepared drafts for eventual publication, Lucien Carr objected to the use of his first name, telling Kerouac that it was ‚Äúpejorative.‚Äù It should have been, Kerouac explained to Ginsberg in a letter on August 28, 1958, ‚Äúmajorative,‚Äù referring to Lucien Midnight's intended all- encompassing universal sweep of humanity and its surrounding cosmos. In December 1958, Kerouac stayed up through the night skimming through the pages of the Holy Bible and an English dictionary looking for a replacement title. When he heard Charles Van Doren, on a morning talk show (the son of Mark Van Doren and notoriously involved in a television quiz show scandal that decade) refer to a phrase from Mark Twain‚Äôs journal, Kerouac had his answer. Twain writes, \\"I never felt so happy in my life, sir ‚Äî never since I was born, sir. Loved that hoary, venerable old angel as if he was my father, sir.‚Äù Lucien Midnight then became Old Angel Midnight. Kerouac dedicated the poem to Lucien Carr, a friend of Kerouac who was a key member of the early Beat Generation, and whose manner of speech was the initial inspiration for Old Angel Midnight.

It started feeding electricity to the National Grid in November 2005. The headquarters of Apple Inc, in California. The roof is covered with solar panels. Building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are photovoltaic materials that are used to replace conventional building materials in parts of the building envelope such as the roof, skylights, or facades. They are increasingly being incorporated into the construction of new buildings as a principal or ancillary source of electrical power, although existing buildings may be retrofitted with similar technology. The advantage of integrated photovoltaics over more common non-integrated systems is that the initial cost can be offset by reducing the amount spent on building materials and labor that would normally be used to construct the part of the building that the BIPV modules replace. These advantages make BIPV one of the fastest growing segments of the photovoltaic industry. The term building-applied photovoltaics (BAPV) is sometimes used to refer to photovoltaics that are a retrofit ‚Äì integrated into the building after construction is complete. Most building- integrated installations are actually BAPV. Some manufacturers and builders differentiate new construction BIPV from BAPV.  History  PV applications for buildings began appearing in the 1970s. Aluminum-framed photovoltaic modules were connected to, or mounted on, buildings that were usually in remote areas without access to an electric power grid. In the 1980s photovoltaic module add-ons to roofs began being demonstrated. These PV systems were usually installed on utility-grid-connected buildings in areas with centralized power stations. In the 1990s BIPV construction products specially designed to be integrated into a building envelope became commercially available. A 1998 doctoral thesis by Patrina Eiffert, entitled An Economic Assessment of BIPV, hypothesized that one day there would an economic value for trading Renewable Energy Credits (RECs). A 2011 economic assessment and brief overview of the history of BIPV by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory suggests that there may be significant technical challenges to overcome before the installed cost of BIPV is competitive with photovoltaic panels.James, Ted; Goodrich, A.; Woodhouse, M.; Margolis, R.; Ong, S. (November 2011). \\"Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) in the Residential Sector: An Analysis of Installed Rooftop System Prices.\\" NREL/TR-6A20-53103. However, there is a growing consensus that through their widespread commercialization, BIPV systems will become the backbone of the zero energy building (ZEB) European target for 2020. Despite technical promise, social barriers to widespread use have also been identified, such as the conservative culture of the building industry and integration with high-density urban design. These authors suggest enabling long-term use likely depends on effective public policy decisions as much as the technological development.

United Solar Ovonic thin- film PV building-integrated solar shingles There are four main types of BIPV products: * Crystalline silicon solar panels for ground-based and rooftop power plant * Amorphous crystalline silicon thin film solar pv modules which could be hollow, light, red blue yellow, as glass curtain wall and transparent skylight * CIGS-based (Copper Indium Gallium Selenide) thin film cells on flexible modules laminated to the building envelope element or the CIGS cells are mounted directly onto the building envelope substrate * Double glass solar panels with square cells inside Building-Integrated Photovoltaic modules are available in several forms: * Flat roofs **The most widely installed to date is an amorphous thin film solar cell integrated to a flexible polymer module which has been attached to the roofing membrane using an adhesive sheet between the solar module backsheet and the roofing membrane. Copper Indium Gallium Selenide (CIGS) technology is now able to deliver cell efficiency of 17% as produced by a US-based companyMiaSol√© website and comparable building- integrated module efficiencies in TPO single ply membranes by the fusion of these cells by a UK-based company.BIPVco technical datasheet * Pitched roofs **Solar roof tiles are (ceramic) roof tiles with integrated solar modules. The ceramic solar roof tile is developed and patented by a Dutch companyZEP BV in 2013. **Modules shaped like multiple roof tiles. **Solar shingles are modules designed to look and act like regular shingles, while incorporating a flexible thin film cell. **It extends normal roof life by protecting insulation and membranes from ultraviolet rays and water degradation. It does this by eliminating condensation because the dew point is kept above the roofing membrane. ** Metal pitched roofs (both structural and architectural) are now being integrated with PV functionality either by bonding a free-standing flexible moduleTechnical datasheet for a free-standing flexible module or by heat and vacuum sealing of the CIGS cells directly onto the substrate Technical datasheet for a heat and vacuum-sealed CIGS cell *Facade ** Facades can be installed on existing buildings, giving old buildings a whole new look. These modules are mounted on the facade of the building, over the existing structure, which can increase the appeal of the building and its resale value. *Glazing ** Photovoltaic windows are (semi)transparent modules that can be used to replace a number of architectural elements commonly made with glass or similar materials, such as windows and skylights. In addition to producing electric energy, these can create further energy savings due to superior thermal insulation properties and solar radiation control.  Transparent and translucent photovoltaics  Transparent solar panels use a tin oxide coating on the inner surface of the glass panes to conduct current out of the cell. The cell contains titanium oxide that is coated with a photoelectric dye. Most conventional solar cells use visible and infrared light to generate electricity. In contrast, the innovative new solar cell also uses ultraviolet radiation. Used to replace conventional window glass, or placed over the glass, the installation surface area could be large, leading to potential uses that take advantage of the combined functions of power generation, lighting and temperature control. Another name for transparent photovoltaics is ‚Äútranslucent photovoltaics‚Äù (they transmit half the light that falls on them). Similar to inorganic photovoltaics, organic photovoltaics are also capable of being translucent.  Types of transparent and translucent photovoltaics  Non-wavelength-selective = Some non-wavelength-selective photovoltaics achieve semi-transparency by spatial segmentation of opaque solar cells. This method uses any type of opaque photovoltaic cell and spaces several small cells out on a transparent substrate. Spacing them out in this way reduces power conversion efficiencies dramatically while increasing transmission. Another branch of non-wavelength-selective photovoltaics utilize visibly absorbing thin-film semi-conductors with small thicknesses or large enough band gaps that allow light to pass through. This results in semi-transparent photovoltaics with a similar direct trade off between efficiency and transmission as spatially segmented opaque solar cells. = Wavelength- selective = Wavelength-selective photovoltaics achieve transparency by utilizing materials that only absorb UV and/or NIR light and were first demonstrated in 2011. Despite their higher transmissions, lower power conversion efficiencies have resulted due to a variety of challenges. These include small exciton diffusion lengths, scaling of transparent electrodes without jeopardizing efficiency, and general lifetime due to the volatility of organic materials used in TPVs in general.  Innovations in transparent and translucent photovoltaics  Early attempts at developing non-wavelength- selective semi-transparent organic photovoltaics using very thin active layers that absorbed in the visible spectrum were only able to achieve efficiencies below 1%. However in 2011, transparent organic photovoltaics that utilized an organic chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc) donor and a fullerene acceptor exhibited absorption in the ultraviolet and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum with efficiencies around 1.3% and visible light transmission of over 65%. In 2017, MIT researchers developed a process to successfully deposit transparent graphene electrodes onto organic solar cells resulting in a 61% transmission of visible light and improved efficiencies ranging from 2.8%-4.1%. Perovskite solar cells, popular due to their promise as next-generation photovoltaics with efficiencies over 25%, have also shown promise as translucent photovoltaics. In 2015, a semitransparent perovskite solar cell using a methylammonium lead triiodide perovskite and a silver nanowire mesh top electrode demonstrated 79% transmission at an 800 nm wavelength and efficiencies at around 12.7%.  Government subsidies  In some countries, additional incentives, or subsidies, are offered for building-integrated photovoltaics in addition to the existing feed-in tariffs for stand-alone solar systems. Since July 2006 France offered the highest incentive for BIPV, equal to an extra premium of EUR 0.25/kWh paid in addition to the 30 Euro cents for PV systems.PV Subsidies: France up, Netherlands down  Leonardo ENERGY These incentives are offered in the form of a rate paid for electricity fed to the grid.

China  Further to the announcement of a subsidy program for BIPV projects in March 2009 offering RMB20 per watt for BIPV systems and RMB15/watt for rooftop systems, the Chinese government recently unveiled a photovoltaic energy subsidy program ‚Äúthe Golden Sun Demonstration Project‚Äù. The subsidy program aims at supporting the development of photovoltaic electricity generation ventures and the commercialization of PV technology. The Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Energy Bureau have jointly announced the details of the program in July 2009. Qualified on-grid photovoltaic electricity generation projects including rooftop, BIPV, and ground mounted systems are entitled to receive a subsidy equal to 50% of the total investment of each project, including associated transmission infrastructure. Qualified off-grid independent projects in remote areas will be eligible for subsidies of up to 70% of the total investment. In mid November, China‚Äôs finance ministry has selected 294 projects totaling 642 megawatts that come to roughly RMB 20 billion ($3 billion) in costs for its subsidy plan to dramatically boost the country‚Äôs solar energy production.

Williams, 549 U.S. 346 (2007), 556 U.S. 178 (2009), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States, which held that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits punitive damages, and ordered a lower court to reconsider its damages awards on that basis. Trial court decision Mayola Williams, the widow of Jesse D. Williams, who died of smoking-related lung cancer in 1997, sued Philip Morris USA, a cigarette manufacturer, for fraud based on Philip Morris advertisements and sponsored studies that made cigarettes seem less dangerous than they actually were. At trial in 1999, the jury found for Williams and awarded her $821,485.50 in compensatory damages and $79.5 million in punitive damages. At that time, the verdict was the largest against a tobacco company. The trial court found that the compensatory damages exceeded the state cap and the punitive damages were \\"grossly excessive\\". It reduced the respective amounts to $521,485.50 and $32 million. Appeals On appeal, the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed and reinstated the $79.5 million judgment. Following the \\"guideposts\\" established in BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore, the Court of Appeals examined whether the punitive damages were appropriate based on (1) the degree of reprehensibility of the conduct, (2) the disparity between the actual harm and the punitive damages, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages and civil penalties allowed in similar cases. While determining the reprehensibility of Philip Morris's actions, the court considered the length of the misinformation campaign and the number of people it had reached, concluding that its actions were so reprehensible that they justified punitive damages 97 times greater than the actual damages. The Oregon Supreme Court denied review. The Supreme Court of the United States then granted certiorari, and in the 2007 decision vacated the Court of Appeals' judgment, remanding the case to the Oregon Court of Appeals for that court to reconsider the amount of the punitive damages award in light of State Farm v. Campbell. Later decisions The Court of Appeals again reinstated the $79.5 million judgment. On appeal, the Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, also holding that the courts can consider evidence of similar conduct to other people in Oregon‚Äìeven those not party to the lawsuit‚Äìwhen awarding punitive damages. Philip Morris then appealed again to the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008, arguing that the Oregon Supreme Court ignored the guidance the U.S. Supreme Court had given as to punitive damages. In March 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court in essence affirmed the lower court decision when it withdrew their writ of certiorari.Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Williams, . Philip Morris then paid Williams $61 million, as under Oregon law the state collects 60% of all punitive awards and places those funds into a compensation fund for crime victims. After Philip Morris paid Williams, it then fought the state over paying the remaining amount in punitive damages to the state, claiming that the tobacco settlement signed by Oregon in 1998 prevented Oregon from collecting. The Oregon Supreme Court again disagreed with Philip Morris in December 2011 and ruled that they had to pay the remaining punitive damages, which after interest then totaled $99 million.

According to Pausanias, there was a \\"lesser Daedala\\" (ŒîŒ±ŒØŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒ± ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅŒ¨), celebrated every four years or so exclusively by the Plataeans, and a \\"greater Daedala\\" (ŒîŒ±ŒØŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒ± ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ±), celebrated by all of Boeotians every fourteen cycles (approx. 60 years). In the lesser Daedala, the people of Plataea went to an ancient oak grove and exposed pieces of cooked meat to ravens, attentively watching upon which tree any of the birds, after taking a piece of meat, would settle. Out of this tree they carved an image, and having it dressed as a bride, they set it on a bullock cart with a bridesmaid beside it. The image seems then to have been drawn to the bank of the river Asopus and back to the town, attended by a cheering crowd. These adorned xoana were also called \\"daidala\\" (Œ¥Œ¨ŒπŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒ± or Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒ¥Œ¨ŒªŒµŒπŒ±), with the connotation that they were \\"crafted\\" or \\"fashioned\\" (compare Daedalus, \\"daidalos\\" (Œ¥Œ±ŒØŒ¥Œ±ŒªŒøœÇ) meaning \\"cunning worker\\"). After fourteen of these cycles, the great Daidala was celebrated by all the people of Boeotia; and at its start one wooden figure was chosen from the many that had accumulated through the years and designated the \\"bride\\". The wooden figure was prepared as a bride for a wedding, ritually bathed in the Asopus, adorned and raised on a wagon with an attendant. This wagon led a procession of wains carrying the accumulated daedala up to the summit of Mount Cithaeron, where a wooden sacrificial altar was erected out of square pieces of wood. This was covered with a quantity of dry wood, and the towns, persons of rank, and other wealthy individuals, offered each a heifer to Hera and a bull to Zeus with plenty of wine and incense, while at the same time all of the daedala were placed upon the altar. For those who did not possess sufficient means, it was customary to offer small sheep, but all these offerings were immolated in a hecatomb in the same manner as those of the wealthier persons. The fire consumed both offerings and altar. This archaic custom was explained with an aition or \\"origin myth\\" about Hera and Zeus, which is related by Pausanias: :\\"Hera, they say, was for some reason or other angry with Zeus, and had retreated to Euboia. Zeus, failing to make her change her mind, visited Kithairon, at that time despot in Plataea, who surpassed all men for his cleverness. So he ordered Zeus to make an image of wood, and to carry it, wrapped up, in a bullock wagon, and to say that he was celebrating his marriage with Plataia, the daughter of Asopus. So Zeus followed the advice of Kithairon. Hera heard the news at once, and at once appeared on the scene. But when she came near the wagon and tore away the dress from the image, she was pleased at the deceit, on finding it a wooden image and not a bride, and was reconciled to Zeus. To commemorate this reconciliation they celebrate a festival called Daidala, because the men of old time gave the name of daidala to wooden images... the Plataeans hold the festival of the Daidala every six years, according to the local guide, but really at a shorter interval. I wanted very much to calculate exactly the interval between one Daedala and the next, but I was unable to do so. In this way they celebrate the feast.\\" :::- Pausanias (IX.3 ¬ß 1, &c.;) The account of the origin of the Daedala given by Pausanias agrees in the main points with the story related by Plutarch, who wrote a work on the plataean Daedala; the only difference is that Plutarch represents Zeus as receiving his advice to deceive Hera from Alalcomenes (instead of Kithairon), and that he calls Plataea, \\"Daedala\\". Other usages The term \\"daedala\\" can also be taken as a noun derived from Daedalus, the famed inventor. In this sense, Lucretius speaks of Natura daedala rerum, \\"Nature, the inventor of all things\\".

A small fraction of Mambilla migrants left the Mambilla Plateau for the Ndom Plain (also known as the Tikar Plain) on the Cameroon side of the international border as well as in a couple of small villages, such as New Namba, further north towards the towns of Gashaka and Banyo. The preferred ethnonym is spelt Mambila in Cameroon and Mambilla in Nigeria. \\"Norr\\" is also used (the word for person in Nigerian dialects of Mambilla) (Bami-Yuno, ms). Identification The Mambilla / Mambila people of Nigeria and Cameroon regard themselves as a group with a common identity. They are the denizens of the Mambilla Region, and have been in their homeland for upwards of 4,000 years (Zeitlyn & Connell, 2003). In Nigerian dialects they refer to themselves as 'Norr' (the people) while in Cameroon there is a collective noun 'Ba' that is used in the unmarked sense to refer to the Mambilla, and also to refer to Mambilla in Cameroon on the Ndom or northern Tikar plain (see below) contrastively with neighbouring Mambilla on the highlands of the Mambilla plateau who can be referred to as \\"Bo ba bo\\". The populations of different Mambilla villages speak different dialects of Mambilla or closely related Mambiloid languages. They also share a set of closely related cultural practices, in particular a conjunction of masquerade and oath-taking called \\"suu\\", \\"shua\\", \\"sua\\" or \\"shuaga\\". In the Somie (Ndiba) dialect this is phonetically written as [ Éwa…£a]. See discussion in \\"Sua in Somie\\" cited below. A locally written French language historical source for Somie history is Zeitlyn Mial & Mbe 2000. The Mambila language is a congeries of dialects and related languages. The SIL Ethnologue database gives two codes MCU for the Cameroonian dialects and MZK for the Nigerian dialects. See the survey work of Bruce Connell on the VIMS website cited below, and the article on Mambiloid languages. The Common Mambilla or Tungbo Dialect is the most widely understood Mambila dialect in Nigeria. It is also the literary language of Mambilla for the vast majority who inhabit the Mambilla Plateau. The Mambila New Testament known as 'Li Fa' and several Mambilla Language study texts are written in the Common Mambilla dialect for Nigeria. A New Testament in Ju Ba is also available for speakers of Cameroonian dialects. Location Most Mambilla live on the Mambilla plateau with their modern capital at Bommi (Gembu in \\"Sardauna\\" Local Government. ). in Taraba State of Nigeria [Note that the traditional and historical name of this local government area has been \\"Mambilla\\", and that the \\"Sardauna\\" misnomer is a modern imposition by external or non-indigenous peoples, particularly, in conjunction with the defunct Jega Government of 1984]. This is a highland plateau, the northerly continuation of the Bamenda grassfields. The plateau is dissected by many rivers (notably the River Donga) leaving a complex geography of steep valleys separated by highlands (all of similar altitude). The Gang Peak, located in the northeastern corner of the Mambilla Plateau, on the Mambilla-Gashaka- Cameroon tri-point boundary zone, is Nigeria's loftiest landform. Villages are found both on the hilltops and on valley bottoms, and are relatively isolated from one another particularly during the rainy seasons when river crossings can be difficult (and impossible for motorised transport). Agriculture is concentrated on the valley bottoms while the highlands have been extensively grazed since the 1940s, i.e. since the immigration of cattle graziers towards the end of British administration (it was part of British Cameroon until the referendum of 1959/61). There has been overgrazing and erosion has caused considerable problems from the late 1970s onwards. A smaller number of Mambilla, migrants from Nyo or Mvor in southern Mambilla Plateau and other villages, are to be found on the edge of the Ndom (northern Tikar) plain in Cameroon at the foot of the escarpment of the Mambilla Plateau. The principal Cameroonian villages are Atta, Sonkolong and Somi√©. This is an area which, beginning from about A.D 1790, they, in a piece-meal fashion, progressively captured from the Twumwu, a pre-Tikar group that inhabited the Ndom Plain (Zeitlyn & Connell, 2003). At an altitude of some 700 m, these Ndom villages live in a different ecological zone from those of the Plateau: for example, oil palm plantations and gallery forest are found there.  Art  The Mambila Plateau lies north of the grasslands. The inhabitants developed unique art styles of sculpture made of clay, terracotta, pith, and wood. Wood carving is done primarily by men, yet there is no one specific specialist. Tools are a creation of the carver themselves, creating tools as needed. Things like chisels, curved knives, straight knives are made by the sculptor. Using these handmade tools leaves room for error and never leaves and entirely smooth surface. Sculptures with heart shaped faces symbolize the earliest artistic endeavors, while current mask display stylizations of birds, beasts, and humans. A majority of Mambila figures in the Mambila Plateau were taken by art traders in the 1960s and 1970s, leaving very few figures and sculptures to be documented. The most documented figures of the Mambila culture are Tadep and Kike figures. Male Tadep Guardian Figure, Brooklyn Museum  Figures  Tadep depict male and female pairs usually carved from low density wood. They can also depict singular figures of multiples of one sex. Kike are figures carved and made from the pith of raffia palm. and are larger statue type figures. These figures would often be placed inside of granaries, while other statues are displayed on the outside as well. These objects were sacra of associations related to illness and healing. Tadep and Kike were part of the Sauga association. There are several eccentricities that set their art apart from other cultures. Mambila figures made of soft pith, and the attachment to shrines and sacred enclosures are something that only certain sexes are allowed to see. The pith figures were to act as embodiments of visiting ancestral spirits. Ancestral spirits guarded family treasures located within shrines by embodying these figurines. Another distinction is the annual application of their color scheme of red, white, and black to functioning objects. The male figure had a small opening in the abdomen as a receptacle for food particles, while the female figure had a blocked off abdomen opening.  Tawong Festival  During the biannual dance that takes place in June or July and November or December, the young unmarried people of the villages are allowed freedom of sexual experimentation. Typically after the dancing and pairing off of the unmarried, they celebrate the planting of crops with a celebration that happens only for men. Men travel from village to village for festivities which include dance, sports, and form friendships that promote intertribal relations. Masks are worn during this time and can only be seen by men. The \\"Suah Bvur\\" is a mask of the first rank, typically like a helmet and worn over the head, resting on the wearers shoulders. It is always accompanied by a number of second rank masks like the \\"Suah Dua\\", which rest on top of the head. Almost all masks and art figures are kept from women as they are not allowed to see them, or be any part of them. Farmer Grazier disputes  In late 2000, and thereafter, particularly on 1 January 2002 when Udawa Fulani mercenaries from Niger and Chad invaded the Mambilla Plateau, conflicts over land led to many Fulani herders being driven from the Mambilla Plateau and becoming refugees in Cameroon. (There were confirmed newspaper and official reports of Fulani mercenaries being brought into Mambilla.See Gaussett's article, and reports/photos of the captured mercenaries in TheNews, 4 February 2002, pp. 29 ‚Äì30, New Impression, 22 April 2002, p. 42; Daily Independent, 21‚Äì27 January 2002, pp. A1, A2; TELL, 28 January 2002, p. 23 Similar troubles occurred in mid 2017. Climate There is a dry season from late November until early March, the rains (which are abundant and regular) peaking in August. Showers and isolated heavy rains are rarely experienced between December and February On the Mambilla Plateau the altitude is sufficient for evenings to be cool. Daytime temperatures hardly exceeds making it the coldest plateau in Nigeria.

He received his B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Arizona in 1965. He spent a year in the University of Arizona's graduate program in anthropology before pursuing his Ph.D., which he received in 1970 from the University of Utah. During his graduate studies, Adovasio worked on multiple excavations and ecological and archaeological mapping projects in Utah; he also performed basketry and textile analyses for Danger Cave and Hogup Cave.Adovasio JM, personal communication, November 2012. By his own admission, Adovasio was \\"programmed to be an archaeologist.\\" He developed a passion for archaeology at a young age. Under the guidance of his mother, a historian, he learned to read using books about geology, paleontology, and archaeology. Once at the University of Utah, Adovasio studied under the tutelage of Jesse D. Jennings, whose work at Danger Cave and other eastern Great basin closed sites greatly influenced Adovasio's research foci. During Adovasio's graduate years at the University of Utah, he processed a deluge of perishable artifacts (baskets, strings, and cords) from Hogup Cave. Through this work, Adovasio developed expertise in and passion for perishable artifacts that has persisted throughout his career.Baker, D.

From 1995-2001, he served as Commissioner of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. He currently serves as an expert witness for Archaeological Resource Protection Act (ARPA) cases, helping to protect archaeological sites from looters. Before taking a position at Mercyhurst, Adovasio taught at Youngstown State University and at the University of Pittsburgh. He taught anthropology at Youngstown State from 1966-1968 and 1970-1971. After taking a postdoctoral stint at the Smithsonian Institution, he assumed a position at Pitt, where he worked from 1972 to 1990. While there, he taught anthropology, Latin American studies, and geology and planetary sciences; he also served as Chairman of the Department of Anthropology and Director of the Cultural Resource Management Program (CRMP). In fact, Adovasio founded the Cultural Resource Management Program at Pitt. The fundamental purpose of CRMP was to conduct basic research and to provide a vehicle to teach students how to conduct archaeology utilizing precise data collection and documentation procedures often with highly sophisticated tools. He maintained this research/teaching orientation at the Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute. Adovasio has also worked on a multitude of excavations in North America and internationally, including Meadowcroft Rockshelter, where he has been involved for the past 40 years. He has also worked on excavations in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and Israel. He has also analyzed perishable remains from excavations in Central and South America, Europe, and Asia. Honors and awards Adovasio is the recipient of a number of honors and awards. In 1971, the Smithsonian Institution awarded him a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship, followed by a Certificate for Academic Achievement in 1972. Adovasio received an honorary D.Sc. from Washington and Jefferson College in 1983. He also won the Mercyhurst College Alumni Association Outstanding Achievement Award (1993), the Pennsylvania Historic Preservation Board Award for Archaeological Research at Meadowcroft Rockshelter (1996), and the J. Alden Mason Award for Career Contribution to Pennsylvania Prehistory (1996). In 1995, Adovasio became a Knight of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. His peers elected him as a fellow for the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he has served as a lecturer for the Archaeological Institute of America since 2008. Meadowcroft Rockshelter Adovasio excavated the Meadowcroft Rockshelter site in Pennsylvania from 1973 to 1978 under the auspices of the University of Pittsburgh. The site contains 11 distinct stratigraphic units spanning at least 16,000, and potentially 19,000 radiocarbon years, of sporadic occupation, making it the oldest and longest occupational sequence in eastern North America and one of the oldest in the Western Hemisphere.Adovasio JM, Gunn JD, Stuckenrath, R. 1978. The Meadowcroft Rockshelter, 1977: An overview. American Antiquity, 43 (4): 632-651. The site was visited principally during the Fall of the year by broad spectrum foragers throughout its long history. Even after the appearance of horticulture in the area, the basic function of the site never changed. Due to the age of this site, Adovasio has been involved in the \\"Clovis First\\" debate for several decades, defending Meadowcroft as a pre-Clovis site. Skeptics like James Mead and C. Vance Haynes have repeatedly questioned Meadowcroft's age based on concerns about contamination of radiocarbon samples and the absence of Pleistocene fauna.Adovasio JM, Gunn JD, Donahue J, Stuckenrath R, Guilday JE, Volman, K. 1980. Yes, Virginia, it really is that old: A reply to Haynes and Mead. American Antiquity, 45 (3): 588-595. To support the radiocarbon dates from the earliest occupational levels, Adovasio emphasizes that the 52 radiocarbon dates from Meadowcroft are, with several inconsequential low order reversals in late contexts, in absolute stratigraphic order. Additionally, all of the assayed samples derive from firepits and fire features with directly associated cultural material of indisputable anthropogenic origins. The entire suite of early dates derives from beneath a rockfall event of Clovis age. Haynes and others have raised the possibility of coal contamination, but only of the 11 oldest dates.Haynes CV. 1980. Paleoindian charcoal from Meadowcroft Rockshelter: Is contamination a problem? American Antiquity, 45 (3): 582-587. Adovasio has repeatedly pointed out that there is no coal seam at Meadowcroft‚Äîonly isolated outcrops of vitrinite‚Äîmaking contamination unlikely. Further, the highly localized vitrinite is separated from the Stratum IIa occupational floors by approximately 30‚Äì50 cm of undisturbed deposits. Regardless, vitrinite is not soluble in water and could therefore only contaminate fire features in the stratum as particulate matter. Repeated examination of the radiocarbon samples by four different laboratories has consistently failed to reveal any particulate fragments. Additionally, microstratigraphic analyses by Paul Goldberg and associates has conclusively indicated absolutely no groundwater movement and hence, no vehicle for transporting contaminants in any of the sites 11 strata.Goldberg P, and Arpin TL. 1999. Micromorphological analysis of sediments from Meadowcroft Rockshelter, Pennsylvania: Implications for radiocarbon dating. Journal of Field Archaeology 26(3): 325-342. Furthermore, if vitrinite contaminated the dates in Stratum IIa, it logically follows that it would have similarly contaminated all subsequent dates as the same vitrinite exposures were present throughout the Meadowcroft occupation. If the later dates were contaminated to the same extent claimed for the earlier dates, the later dates would be several thousand years in the future. Haynes also suggests that soluble matter may have contaminated the carbonized cut bark specimen from lower Stratum IIa, as is the case with the charcoal samples derived from fire features. There is absolutely no evidence for soluble or non-soluble contamination of the cut bark specimen. The faunal remains at Meadowcroft have also been a point of contention; namely, that no Pleistocene fauna has been identified in the stratum dated to the Pleistocene. However, preservation of bone is poor in the deepest levels and only 11.9 grams of identifiable faunal remains have been recovered. Significantly, all of the identifiable remains represent species which have previously been recovered in Pleistocene contexts, though none of them are extinct.Mead JI. 1980. Is it really that old? A comment about the Meadowcroft Rockshelter \\"overview.\\" American Antiquity, 45 (3): 589-582. The pre-Clovis debate continues, with many skeptics resurrecting the same concerns about contamination and absence of Pleistocene fauna. It is notable, however, that although archaeologists have called the early dates from Meadowcroft into question, Adovasio's methods of excavation have always been considered above reproach. Research emphases Adovasio primarily studies soft technologies/perishable artifacts (such as basketry, textiles, and cordage). As an expert in textiles and other perishables, Adovasio has examined approximately 90% of all North American perishablesAdovasio JM, Soffer O, Page J. 2009. The invisible sex: Uncovering the true roles of women in prehistory. New York, NY: Harper Collins Publishers and has written numerous books, guides, papers, and chapters for edited volumes over the identification and analysis of perishables from various parts of the continent. Adovasio also examines the adaptations and behaviors of Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene populations globally and is involved in developing the interdisciplinary relationship between archaeology and geology (geoarchaeology). Finally, he is also involved in the ongoing development of excavations, field documentation, and analytical protocols for excavations, as shown by his work in CRMP at Pitt and at MAI at Mercyhurst. Recently, Adovasio has worked to dispel gender bias in prehistoric archaeology. Traditionally, archaeologists have painted men in prehistoric cultures as the principal breadwinners and central figures in the economy of their respective populations. Adovasio, however, defends the importance of women to prehistoric lifeways in his book The Invisible Sex, coauthored with Olga Soffer and Jake Page. One of the primary reasons the androcentric view has persisted is the relative absence of women from the archaeological record: the durable evidence of male handiwork (lithics) endures, but softer technologies decompose.Adovasio JM, Page J. 2002. The First Americans: In Pursuit of Archaeology‚Äôs Greatest Mystery. New York, NY: Random House Inc. Since women were typically the ones who made and used perishable artifacts, their roles in prehistory are often undetected since these artifacts break down so quickly. Adovasio's specialty lends him a unique window into the world of prehistoric women, providing a logical platform from which to attack traditional concepts about men's and women's roles in prehistoric North America. Current/Future Research: Currently, Adovasio is working in the Gulf of Mexico looking for submerged sites on the continental shelf, focusing on submerged coastlines, especially where rivers meet the ocean. Analysis of submerged sites could yield a wealth of information about prehistoric humans, as modern humans have yet to disturb them due to the rise in sea level that submerged the sites thousands of years ago. He also continues to analyze prehistoric plant fiber perishables from throughout the world. Selected books and monographs *(2010) Adovasio.

The club was a result of the merger of ANU and University of Canberra rugby clubs in 1998, with Northern Suburbs joining in 2001. The club's colours are navy, gold and green. The Uni-Norths home playing fields and clubhouse, known as ‚ÄòThe Barn‚Äô, are located on the grounds of the Australian National University and are within a few minutes walk of the Canberra CBD. The clubhouse has a second-floor balcony which overlooks the Rugby and Cricket No. 1 Oval, with a licensed bar facility and a large catered function centre. History The rugby clubs of Northern Suburbs and Canberra University College (CUC, which later integrated with the ANU) were foundation members of the Federal Capital Territory Rugby Union (FCTRU). The FCTRU, which later became the ACTRU and eventually the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union, was formed in 1937. The Canberra grade competition began in 1938. The Northern Suburbs club played in a myrtle green jersey and was known as the Galloping Greens. Norths won the John I Dent Cup for the premiership seven times between 1940 and 1972. Notable players for Norths include Owen Butler, who was selected for the Wallabies in 1969. The ANU club wore a jersey with blue and white hoops, and started playing in the first grade competition in 1960 after an amalgamation of existing ACTRU grade clubs from Canberra University College (entered first grade in 1938) and Australian Forestry School (entered first grade in 1949). Notable ANU players include Laurie Fisher who captained the first grade team to win the John I Dent Cup in 1992 and later became the coach of the Brumbies. In 1998 the ANU Rugby Club was amalgamated with the University of Canberra Rugby Club (UC Killer Bees). The UC club had fielded teams in the Monaro Division competition and was founded in 1971 at the Canberra College of Advanced Education (CCAE), which became the University of Canberra in 1990. Norths ceded from the ACTRU Premier competition in 2001 and formed a coalition with the new University club. Although not a legal merger, the coalition proved successful, with the Norths Junior Owls receiving additional coaching and administrative resources and junior players progressing through to the senior club. Recent events The club won the Queanbeyan Rugby Sevens Tournament in both the men's and women's competitions in 2009. The Owls won the Laffan Cup, awarded to the winning team of the Australian Universities Rugby Championship in 2011. The Owls women's side won the ACT premiership and minor premiership double in 2014. The Owls women's sevens team also won the Bowl in the Bowral 7's competition in 2014. The Owls Women's premier division side (XV's) won the 2019 Grand Final defeating Royals 40-19.

She later married the librettist of the work, William Bartholomew (1793‚Äì1867), who also collaborated with Mendelssohn on his oratorio Elijah (German: Elias). The anthem is particularly well known through the recording made in 1927 by treble Ernest Lough. The text (derived from Psalm 55): { Hear my prayer, O God, incline Thine ear! Thyself from my petition do not hide. Take heed to me! Hear how in prayer I mourn to Thee, Without Thee all is dark, I have no guide. The enemy shouteth, the godless come fast!

The Afghan rug weighed 30 kilos and was flown on an intelligence service plane, avoiding import tax. The ministry said the transportation from Kabul to Berlin on the jet of the chief of the secret service was done as \\"a personal favour\\". The centre-left opposition accused the minister of \\"brazen abuse\\" of office, which risked undermining Germany's efforts to promote good governance in countries like Afghanistan. Hiring affair On 2 May 2012 the German TV magazine Monitor reported that after Niebel took the office of Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development over 40 members or staff of the FDP were hired to work in his ministry.

He works at Institut Jules Bordet (Brussels, Belgium). He lives in Baelen  Earlier work  Breast cancer cells (BCC) frequently metastasize to the skeleton, where they lead to tumor-induced osteolysis and subsequent morbidity. Marc Lacroix has investigated the interrelationships between BCC and bone cells (osteoblasts, the bone-building cells, and osteoclasts, the bone-degrading cells). With colleagues, he discovered that BCC produce soluble factors increasing osteoclast activity, notably interleukin-11, the production of which is reduced by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor aspirin. BCC also reduce the proliferation of osteoblasts and their production of collagen, the main protein component of bone. Marc Lacroix also examined the response BCC to the anti-osteolytic agent calcitonin In close collaboration with Prof. Guy Leclercq (Laboratoire Jean-Claude Heuson de Canc√©rologie Mammaire, Institut Jules Bordet, Belgium), Marc Lacroix has studied various aspects of estrogen receptor biology, ligand-binding and transcriptional activity, and life-cycle.  Recent work  The amount of data on breast cancer available for the scientific and medical community is growing rapidly. According to PubMed, a search engine offering access to the MEDLINE database of citations and abstracts of biomedical research articles, 7918 papers containing the expression ¬´breast cancer¬ª were published in 2006. Their number was 3592 in 1996, 1455 in 1986 and only 626 in 1976. In general, the older information is overlaid by more recent data and forgotten to some extent. In 2004, Lacroix and colleagues collected and assembled data from hundreds of articles related to the biology, pathology and genetics of in situ, invasive and metastatic breast cancers. These papers were covering a time period of about 25 years. Lacroix et al. concluded that despite undergoing increasing genetic alteration, most individual breast cancers rather surprisingly maintain their phenotype when they evolve from in situ to the metastatic state. This conclusion was in opposition to a progression model widely accepted at that time, which was suggesting that carcinoma in situ could evolve into invasive carcinoma and subsequently produce metastases through an accumulation of molecular abnormalities possibly allowing extensive phenotype changes and subsequent gain of aggressiveness.

() is a terrestrial television station in Taiwan and was founded in 1971. Recent milestones of the network are in sports events include to have the distinction to offer exclusive coverage of the 2017 Universiade which was held in Taipei. This included airing the opening and closing ceremonies plus major games and it enabled its YouTube channel with several options to watch the rest of the games. Due to recent interest on soccer in Taiwan triggered by the success of its National team it also bought the rights to broadcast in its free-to-air waves the 2018 FIFA World Cup for all matches from the eight-finals to the end of the tournament becoming with that the only channel which offered an event often reserved to cable TV channels. History Founded on October 31, 1971, CTS began as a joint venture between the Republic of China Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Education. In its inception, CTS was the only VHF television channel on the island of Taiwan. In 1998, the channel was commissioned by the Republic of China to provide an \\"Electronic Government\\" program, which would act as an informational source for government workers. On July 1, 2006, by virtue of the government's media reform law, the channel was incorporated into the Taiwan Broadcasting System (TBS) (the island state's consortium of public television stations) with Public Television Service (PTS) being the other member of the group. The new structure called for the transfer of the station's main studios from Taipei to Kaohsiung over a span of five years. Afterwards, it was allowed to continue to generate income through traditional advertisements and maintain its 60-40 ratio of entertainment to news programming. Given its reputation as the network wherein many of Taiwan's best dramas were broadcast, CTS today is active in an ongoing campaign to restore its status as the official drama channel of Taiwan. Notable programs aired by CTS Birth of Heart (È¢®Èõ®Áîü‰ø°ÂøÉ) was the CTS's first drama which aired in 1977 simultaneously over TTV, CTV, and CTS. Today (‰ªäÂ§©), one of CTS's most popular women's magazine shows, aired from 1972 to 1988. It won the prestigious Golden Bell Awards three times (in 1982, 1985, and 1988). The Variety 100 (Á∂úËóù100) was hosted by veteran Chang Hsiao-yen (Zhang Xiaoyan). It was one of the earliest prime time variety shows on CTS and 1979 to 1984. Twin Bang (ÈÄ£Áí∞Ê≥°) was a popular daily CTS show during the 1980s and 90s. It ran from 1986 to 1994. Chinese Characters (ÊØèÊó•‰∏ÄÂ≠ó), the CTS version of a popular educational program, showcased the Chinese writing characters in traditional form. Airing from 1981 to 1998, it was the similar to a version on the TVB network in Hong Kong. Justice Pao or Justice Bao (ÂåÖÈùíÂ§©) was one of the most popular Chinese TV series of all time. The first version aired in 1974 with 350 episodes. The second version aired in 1993 with 236 episodes. It became the most popular Asian drama in history. It was shown in 80 countries in more than 40 languages (including Tagalog on ABC-5 now known as TV5 aired as \\"Judge Bao\\") and was the longest TV series ever produced by the CTS network. In February 2009, a new \\"Judge Bao\\" aired on the CTS for the third time. Love (ÊÑõ), the first Chinese series on CTS, shown in both Mandarin and Taiwanese (Hokkien), aired 68 episodes. Doraemon (ÂìÜÂï¶AÂ§¢), the Japanese animated series from the TV Asahi network, was shown in the Mandarin-dubbed version on CTS. Reruns still air on CTS today. The Four Brothers of Peking (‰∫¨ÂüéÂõõÂ∞ë), the 53-part TV drama from the CTS network was set in latter part of the Qing Dynasty. Super Sunday (Ë∂ÖÁ¥öÊòüÊúüÂ§©), the most popular Sunday night variety show program ever, was first originally hosted by Chang Hsiao-yen (Zhang Xiaoyan) and Harlem Yu Cheng-ching (Yu Chengengqing). Originally shown on the TTV network from 1994 to 1996, it was transferred to the CTS network in 1996 and stayed for seven years. Space Warriors (Â§™Á©∫Êà∞Â£´), was a Tokusatsu in Taiwan. The program used the opening theme song of Gavan and used the stunts of Dynaman. In the first season, the four colors, Yellow, Black, Green, and Pink, used the tear weapons of Bioman. They continued to use these weapons in the second season. In season two, using the stunts of Goggle V, Red, Black, and Green used the weapons of Sun Vulcan. In season three, the four Colors, Red, Blue, Black, and Pink, used weapons of Changeman. The program ran in the 1980s, ending in 1987. It was later aired in Korea, on KBS Korea, during 1991.

They were one of the twenty-one clubs to meet at the George Hotel, Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 to form the Northern Rugby Football Union. They were originally based in Broughton, Salford. In 1933, they moved out of Salford and into the Manchester district of Gorton and were renamed Belle Vue Rangers in 1946. The original club folded in 1955. In 2005, local businessman, Stefan Hopewell attempted to resurrect the club and now owns the intellectual property to Broughton Rangers and Belle Vue Rangers. History=1877‚Äì1905: Foundation Broughton supplied four players for the Lancashire county rugby team in 1887 The club was founded in 1877 as Broughton and added Rangers for its second season. The club's headquarters was the Bridge Inn on Lower Broughton Road and home games were played at Wheater's Field. On 15 December 1888, Rangers lost to New Zealand Natives 8‚Äì0. From 1892 the headquarters was the Grosvenor Hotel on the corner of Great Clowes Street and Clarence Street. A motion to join the Northern Union was moved by the club captain and carried unanimously. Broughton Rangers was one of 21 clubs which met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield on 29 August 1895 and formed the Northern Rugby Football Union. Broughton built on winning the Lancashire League in 1896‚Äì97 and 1898‚Äì99 by becoming the first champions of the Northern Union. When the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues amalgamated in 1901‚Äì02; Rangers' form was so outstanding that by February the championship was guaranteed. The same year, Broughton won the Challenge Cup beating Salford 25‚Äì0 at Rochdale in front of 15,006 spectators. Rangers won the East Lancashire League that season after finishing 12 points ahead of second-placed Salford. 1906‚Äì1917: Early success Broughton Rangers became the first club to win the Championship and the Northern Union Challenge Cup in the same season in 1901-02.In the 1902 Challenge Cup final Rangers captain Bob Wilson became the first player to score three tries in a final. Broughton Rangers appeared in successive Lancashire Cup Finals, in 1906‚Äì07 and 1907‚Äì08, beating Warrington 15‚Äì6 at Central Park, Wigan but losing to Oldham 16‚Äì9 at Rochdale 12 months later. The Rangers reached the top-four semi-finals in 1907‚Äì08, losing to All Four Cups winners Hunslet. Broughton Rangers lost 14‚Äì20 to New Zealand during the 1907‚Äì1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain on Saturday 19 October 1907, the match attracted a crowd of 24,000, New Zealand led early in the game and despite a Rangers comeback, New Zealand won. The club won the Challenge Cup in 1910‚Äì11 when it beat Wigan 4‚Äì0 at the Willows, Salford in front of a crowd of 8,000. Broughton's last game at Wheater's Field was against St. Helens on 9 April 1913 before moving to the Cliff on Lower Broughton Road, Higher Broughton. Inter-war years Broughton's highest league position between 1918 and 1939 was sixth in 1935‚Äì36 and its lowest, 27th in 1927‚Äì28, with Rangers generally finishing in the bottom half of the league. The only trophy won in the inter-war years was the 1920‚Äì21 Lancashire Cup, when they defeated Leigh 6‚Äì3 at Salford in front of 25,000 spectators. In 1933, Broughton Rangers moved to Belle Vue Stadium, inside the speedway track. In 1941‚Äì42 the club dropped out of the wartime Lancashire League and did not return to league competition until 1945‚Äì46. On 18 September 1935 Rangers signed future Lance Todd Trophy winner Frank Whitcombe from Army Rugby Union buying him out of the army for a fee of ¬£100. Two years later in 1938, they sold him to Bradford Northern for ¬£850, a world record fee for a front row forward. Belle Vue Rangers In 1946‚Äì47, Broughton was renamed Belle Vue Rangers. It made a Lancashire Cup final appearance in 1946‚Äì47 which ended in 9‚Äì3 defeat by Wigan at Station Road, Swinton. The club repeated this feat in 1947‚Äì48; losing again to Wigan 10‚Äì7 at Wilderspool, Warrington. After the war, Rangers finished mid-table or above but after finishing 12th in 1950‚Äì51, Rangers finished 30th, second from bottom in 1954‚Äì55, its last season before the club folded.

Life Andrzej Wasowski was born in Warsaw, Poland in 1924.\\"Andrzej Wasowski; Polish Pianist, 69, Toured as Prisoner,\\" by Bernard Holland, The New York Times, May 29, 1993 His father's family owned estates in Podolia and sugar refineries and mining interests in Silesia. His mother, Princess Maria Glinska Wasowska was Professor of Piano at the Warsaw Conservatory. She, in her turn, had studied piano with Richard Baumeister, a pupil of Franz Liszt. Andrzej began his piano studies with his mother at the age of four. In 1931 he was admitted to the Warsaw Conservatory where he studied with Margerita Trombini-Kazuro, who had studied with one of Liszt's disciples, Giovanni Sgambati. He graduated from the conservatory in 1939 with one of its highest awards, the Grand Prix d'Interpretation. Lwow, where he was living, was overrun by the Russian army in 1939. On hearing him play, they packed him off to give concerts in the Soviet Union where he performed 186 times, giving up to nine concerts in a three-day period. While in the Soviet Union, he studied with Konstantin Igumnov in Moscow. He returned to his native city in 1942. He was permitted to give concerts to benefit war relief organisations, but was not permitted to play Polish music. Since the Nazis forbade performance of Polish music, Wasowski played clandestinely in basements for handfuls of Poles who risked their lives to hear Chopin. When he refused to play concerts for the Nazis, he was put to work in a slave battalion. After the Second World War, all of his family's possessions were seized by the communists, and the 26-year-old Wasowski became a stateless refugee. He placed third in the 1951 Marguerite Long International Piano Competition in Paris and second in the 1952 Busoni International Piano Competition in Bolzano. He toured western Europe extensively in the late 1940s and 1950s. By the mid-1950s he played in Venezuela eventually becoming a citizen of that country. In 1956 he married Countess Maria Grocholska in Cannes. He continued to tour extensively in Europe, South and Latin America including Mexico. He returned to his native Poland for a series of concerts in 1959 and 1960. His U.S. debut was in New York's Carnegie Hall in 1965. In the Fall of 1967, he took up a teaching post at Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His letter of References included a handwritten note from Leopold Stokowski. Mr. Wasowski's family joined him from France in September 1969. During breaks from the school year he travelled back to Europe, South America and throughout the United States to perform. On January 7, 1981, Wasowski played Chopin's Complete Mazurkas in Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. William Zakariasen of the New York Daily News in his review described it as \\"one of the most revelatory Chopin recitals heard in decades.\\"The New York Times, June 29, 1997 In 1983 he settled in Washington D.C. where he played at the Terrace Theater of the Kennedy Center numerous times. He died in Washington. Legacy We would know nothing of his playing were it not for the enterprise of a small US record company, Concord Records, who re-issued Wasowski's 1980 recordings of Chopin's complete mazurkas (previously issued by Finnadar Records) and his 1989 recordings of the complete nocturnes. These recordings were hailed by critics. Bernard Sherman, reviewing the mazurkas for the New York Times described Wasowski as one of those artists the broad international public neglects but critics and colleagues rave about. Another critic, Charles MichenerThe New York Observer, July 29, 1996 praised the Mazurkas as full-blooded and intoxicating, almost shocking in their use of rubato, the freedom with which they shake the pieces' rhythmic structures. Critical acclaim for the nocturnes (recorded in just two days, 30 September and 1 October 1989) was equally marked. The recording received the 1997 Critics Choice Award from National Public Radio, and the critic Jessica Duchen writing in BBC Music Magazine (May 1997) said These performances of the Chopin Nocturnes, recorded in 1989, are really rather extraordinary‚Ä¶ a glorious singing tone of great clarity, eloquence and purity, with beautifully balanced accompaniment and inner voices‚Ä¶ they moved me to tears. Wasowski's recordings show a novel approach to rhythm, especially in the mazurkas. Being familiar with the dances themselves, his readings are informed by the rhythmic conventions of Polish music, resulting in interpretations that differ markedly from the literal notation, but which are perhaps more in keeping with Chopin's own performance (see an extensive discussion in Sherman's review in the external links section). Of his own playing, he said \\"In my conviction, Chopin is not a sentimentalist. On the contrary when I am at the piano I feel his power and anguished revolutionary might.\\" See also *List of Poles References All other biographical material is from a biography which was included with his recordings of the Chopin Mazurkas.

The name 'Tray' derived from the way in which the original assortment was delivered to the shops. Originally Milk Tray was packed in five and a half pound boxes, arranged on trays from which it was sold loose to customers.

It had two runs, one from 1923 to 1925 as LEF, and later from 1927 to 1929 as Novy LEF ('New LEF'). The journal's objective, as set out in one of its first issues, was to \\"re-examine the ideology and practices of so-called leftist art, and to abandon individualism to increase art's value for developing communism.\\" Productivism Although LEF was catholic in its choices of writers, it broadly reflected the concerns of the Productivist left-wing of Constructivism. The editors were Osip Brik and Vladimir Mayakovsky: fittingly, one a Russian Formalist critic and one a poet and designer who helped compose the 1912 manifesto of Russian Futurists entitled, \\"A Slap in the Face of Public Taste\\". The covers were designed by Alexander Rodchenko, and featured photomontages early on, being followed by photographs in New LEF. Among the writings published in LEF for the first time were Mayakovsky's long poem About This, and Sergei Eisenstein's The Montage of Attractions, as well as more political and journalistic works like Isaac Babel's Red Cavalry. The journal had funding from the state, and was discussed critically, but not unsympathetically by Leon Trotsky in Literature and Revolution (1924). Factography The later New LEF (\\"–ù–æ–≤—ã–π –õ–ï–§\\"\\"Novy Lef\\"), which was edited by Mayakovsky along with the playwright, screenplay writer and photographer Sergei Tretyakov, tried to popularise the idea of 'factography': the idea that new technologies such as photography and film should be utilised by the working class for the production of 'factographic' works. In this it had a great deal of influence on theorists in the West, especially Walter Benjamin and Bertolt Brecht. Linked journals also appeared such as the Constructivist architectural journal SA (edited by Moisei Ginzburg and Alexander Vesnin) and Proletarskoe Foto, on photography. The New LEF closed in 1929 over a dispute over its direction between Mayakovsky and Tretyakov, and under pressure for its 'Formalism', which jarred with the incipient Socialist Realism.

While still in Utrecht city the Leidse Rijn crosses the Merwede Canal and the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal. It is the continuation of the Kromme Rijn (Crooked Rhine) through the moat system of Utrecht. The canal ends in Harmelen. There it connects to the Oude Rijn, which eventually flows into the North Sea at Katwijk aan Zee. The canal gives its name to the Utrecht neighborhood of Leidsche Rijn. History Since the beginning of our era, the old course of the Rhine between Utrecht and Harmelen became increasingly more difficult to navigate. The building of a dam in the Kromme Rijn in 1122 led to a silting up of the old Rhine below Utrecht, especially as it meandered through very flat terrain. Already in the early Middle Ages (ca. 700) a canal from Utrecht to Vleuten was dug. When the part Vleuten-Harmelen ultimately became too narrow and winding as well, in 1381 the Oude Rijn (Old Rhine) canal (Harmelen-Utrecht) was dug. Under the expansion plans of the Utrecht city mayor Hendrick Moreelse in 1662-1665 a new shortcut was dug, the Leidse Rijn, connecting to where the Oude Rijn canal made a curve to the northeast. At the place where the new canal connected to the Oude Rijn the nobleman Everard Meyster built an estate called Oog in Al.

ISSN 1368-485X Development The development of the Silent goes back to the early 1990s and its roots can be found in Walter Mauri's light sailplane called the \\"Dream\\". On 8 December 1994 the definitive prototype of Silent light sailplane made its maiden flight from the small grass strip of Gagliano in the northeastern Italian province of Friuli. The glider, flown by test pilot Walter Mauri and towed by a 50 hp trike, was airborne in 200m and, after climbing to 600m, successfully flew for 16 minutes. Series production of the \\"Silent 2\\" with the 13m wings will begin in the second half of 2003. On 1 September 2003, USAF Captain Brock Vaughn flew his kit-built self-launch Silent Club sailplane for the first time. On 22 November 2003 the first test flights of a jet-powered Silent Club sailplane were conducted. Powered by twin AMT USA engines, the 12m Silent easily self-launched with acceptable take-off distance and good climb rate. Several successful flights were conducted to analyze performance, handling, temperature issues, and engine systems. Design The fuselage is carbon and glass fiber composite with epoxy resin. The wings have an elliptical planform, vertical or elliptical design winglets. The wing structure includes extensive use of carbon fiber, both in the sandwich skins and in the tapered I-beam wing spar which uses pultruded carbon rods for the spar caps. The wing geometry is notable in that it varies non-linearly from the root to the tip, both in overall planform shape and in wing section profile. The flaperons stretch for 11.0 meters of the full wingspan and their range of motion varies from positive landing L +8¬∞, to +4¬∞ for thermalling, to 0¬∞, -4¬∞, and S -8¬∞ reflex positions for cruising. Schempp-Hirth-type spoilers extend on the upper wing surface only. Opening the single-element spoilers with stick held results in a noticeable nose-down pitch movement. This, however, can easily be avoided by maintaining the nose attitude relative to the horizon; doing this will cause little airspeed change. Closing the spoilers has a similar pitch-up effect, again easily controlled with stick movement. On approach, the spoilers are moderately effective. Descent rate can be quickly increased by slipping. At approach speed with spoilers out, there is a clear view ahead over the nose. The sailplane is trimmed in pitch via an innovative variable-position horizontal stabilizer. The stabilizer position is governed by the flaperon setting. The five settings of the flaperons control produce corresponding changes to the stabilizer incidence, thus defining the trim airspeed in relation to the flaperons requirements. The conventional elevator remains in trail, minimizing trim drag. There is a fixed or retractable main wheel behind the pilot, with shock absorber and drum brake activated via spoiler control lever aft travel. The Silent airframe has undergone thorough analysis (Politecnico di Milano) and testing (both by the factory and independent parties) . The factory performed complete in-house destructive tests of the wings to confirm that the structure met design loads (the ratings are +5.3/-3.0, +4.6/-2.6, +4.3/-2.3 respectively for the aircraft at gross weight). Note that the Italian RAI (equivalent of the FAA) requires independent testing of the aircraft since the Silent falls within the Italian equivalent of proposed Sport Category. However, for Germany, independent structural tests to failure under supervision of the LBA (German equivalent of the FAA) were required. They are noteworthy in that they are performed at a temperature of 54 ¬∞C (129 ¬∞F)! All tests exceeded the 1.5 safety factor requirement. The structural test program also included fuselage drop testing, stabilizer load testing, and control system load testing. A certificate was issued by the LBA showing conformance with the requirements. Successful flutter tests have been performed by an academic flight group in Italy. The Silent 2 Targa has extremely light ailerons, light elevator, generous rudder. The roll rate is quick because of the lively feel of the ailerons. Stall is predictable and recovery simple. In level flight, as airspeed is reduced when approaching the stall speed the sailplane vibrates a little, at this point decreasing the angle of attack results in airspeed increase and normal flight resume. From a climbing attitude the sailplane stalls decisively, the nose pitches down gently and recovery is easy with stick forward. Spin entry is obvious and recovered with rudder and stick. Variants There are three versions of the Silent Gliders. * The Silent Club version has 12 meter wingspan. *The Silent 2 version has 13 meter wingspan. *The Silent 2 Targa version has 13.3 meter wingspan and a special elevator.

Career * They have released 8 albums, including Locomondo Live!, an album which turned gold in December 2011. Two of their video clips have received the \\"Best Alternative Video Clip\\" award from Mad-TV Greece (in 2007 and 2010). * Locomondo is the most known Reggae band in Greece, as well as the only Greek group that has recorded in Jamaica. This happened in 2005, when the band followed an invitation of ex Skatalites trombonist and Studio One legend Vin Gordon to the \\"island in the sun\\" and recorded the album \\"12 meres stin Jamaica\\" (12 days in Jamaica). The album contained two songs that meant to be great hits in Greece, but also attracted attention beyond the Greek borders. * The first was a reggae cover of the Rembetiko song Frangosyriani composed in 1935 by the legendary Markos Vamvakaris. Taking notice of this interesting musical mixture the German film director, screenwriter and producer of Turkish descent Fatih Akin included the song in his Venice Film Festival Special Jury Prize winning film Soul kitchen in 2009, and used it as the soundtrack for the red carpet event of his film. * The second hit of this album was Den kani kryo stin Ellada (its not cold in Greece), a hymn to a positive way of thinking. The song‚Äôs chorus became a slogan in Greece and is considered the band‚Äôs most known song. * In the next album ‚ÄúMe wanna dance‚Äù the band collaborated with Spanish singer Amparo Sanchez (Amparanoia) in Barcelona and Natty Bo (Ska Cubano) in Athens. * In 2010 Locomondo recorded \\"Goal\\", a romantic song about football, which turned out to be an unofficial soundtrack for the Greek National Football Team qualifying for the second time in its history in the final phase of the World Cup. The video clip of the song featured Greek national player Dimitris Salpingidis who scored the qualifying goal against Ukraine. Although the Greek team disqualified in the first round in South Africa, the band considered it as a strike of luck as Salpingidis scored against Nigeria in the 2nd match, becoming the first player to ever score for Greece in a World Cup final phase. thumb\\"280px\\"\\"x420px\\"Markos Koumaris (Photo by George Karahalios) * In 2012 the italian rap band Club Dogo released the single titled P.E.S. which was based on Locomondo‚Äôs song ‚ÄúPro‚Äù and reached platinum.

The correct toll is determined by requiring all users to take a ticket from a machine or from an attendant when entering the system. The ticket prominently displays the location (or exit number) from which it was issued and may contain a precomputed chart of toll rates for each exit. Upon arrival at the toll booth at the destination exit, the motorist presents the ticket to the toll collector, who determines the correct toll. If no ticket is presented (i.e. the ticket is lost), generally the highest possible toll is charged. Most ticket-based toll roads today use an electronic toll collection system as an alternative. In this case, sensors at both the entry and exit toll plazas read the vehicle's transponder and the correct toll is deducted from the user's account. First employed on the Pennsylvania Turnpike when it opened in 1940, the ticket system has been utilized on lengthy toll highways in which the exits are spread out over a distance on an average of per exit.

Also, traffic entering at said interchange heading away from the mainline toll plaza pays before entering the highway, but traffic entering heading toward the mainline toll plaza receives a ticket.

It is located 160 km from Thessaloniki, and 10 km from the border of the Autonomous Monastic State of the Holy Mountain, or Mount Athos. It is the site of Ancient city and former bishopric Hierissus, and as such remains a Latin Catholic titular see. Ferries run from Ierissos to the east coast of Mount Athos. Since the 2011 local government reform Ierissos has been the seat of the municipality of Aristotelis, and of the municipal unit of Stagira-Akanthos.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior  Names  The name of Ierissos is derived from the Latin Ericius, a translation of Akanthos, the name of the ancient city (also Latinized as Acanthus) located on a ridge bordering the southeast side of the town, from it.  History  Akanthos, near mount Athos, was an Ancient Greek city in the Roman province of Macedonia Prima (civil diocese of Macedonia)) During the Byzantine era Erissos was the seat of a bishopric, evidenced from 883 (see below). From the 10th century onwards, the town's history is indissolubly linked with that of Mount Athos. In 942 there were disputes between Ierissos and the monks of Mount Athos over the borders between Ierissos and the monastic community's lands and, the following year, the differences were settled in person by a large commission of major politicians and church officials. In the summer of 1425, Ierissos came into the hands of the Turks. During that time the Venetians, starting from Cassandreia, landed on the coastline of Ierissos, burnt down the settlement (by then only a large village) and its surroundings and (on departure) set alight the castle and five towers. Under Ottoman rule, Ierissos was one of the privileged Mademochoria. In 1821 Ierissos took part in the Greek War of Independence and during the repression the village was burnt down by the Turks and a large number of residents killed. In 1932 the village was destroyed by a powerful earthquake, with 121 people killed and approximately 500 injured. After the earthquake the new Ierissos was built in its current position, a little north west of the ancient city.Pavlides, S. B.; Tranos,M.

Belasco produced a series of plays at the theater starring Mrs. Leslie Carter, George Arliss, Mary Pickford, and Lillian Gish. In 1910 the name became Republic Theatre when Belasco renamed his Stuyvesant Theatre on West 44th Street for himself. The Republic's most famous tenant during this time was the play Abie's Irish Rose, which ran for 2,327 performances between 1922 and 1927. Billy Minsky converted the Republic into Broadway's first burlesque house in 1931, calling it Minsky's Burlesque. It remained as such until 1941. Minsky built a double runway down the middle of the auditorium for his strippers, the most famous of whom was Gypsy Rose Lee. In 1942, it became a movie theater called The Victory, named to support the war effort during World War II. In 1972, as the neighborhood gradually declined, it became the first theater on 42nd Street to exhibit XXX pornographic films. In the early 1990s, the Victory returned to legitimate theater, using its stage space as a venue for offering plays by non-profit companies. It presented the En Garde Arts company's production of the play Crowbar in 1990 and in 1991 the Theater for a New Audience offered Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, followed by other productions. In 1990, New York City, together with the State of New York, jointly took possession of the Victory. In 1992, it was one of seven 42nd Street theaters to fall under the auspices of New 42nd Street, a non-profit corporation set up to oversee the redevelopment of these historic theaters and operate three projects: The New Victory Theater, The New 42nd Street Studios and The Duke on 42nd Street. The Victory was the first theater to be restored in an effort to revitalize 42nd Street and Times Square by The New 42nd Street organization. Between 1994 and 1995 it underwent an $11.4 million renovation headed by the architectural firm of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. The restoration included rebuilding the original exterior double staircase that had been removed in 1911 for the widening of West 42nd Street, and returning the rest of the theater to much the way it looked during the Belasco era. On December 11, 1995, the refurbished theater, renamed The New Victory Theater, opened as New York's first and only off-Broadway theater for kids and families. Upon its reopening, it became once more the oldest operating theater in New York City. The 499-seat theater presents up to 16 productions each year. Film location Before The New 42nd Street, Inc. took over the theater's lease in the early 1990s, several films were shot at the Victory Theater. In Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, the scene where Robert De Niro takes Cybill Shepherd to the movies was shot there. The scene's exterior shot shows them entering the former Lyric Theatre, which was next door. Scenes in Woody Allen's 1993 film Manhattan Murder Mystery were also filmed there. Toward the end of the movie, Diane Keaton‚Äôs character is held hostage in the Victory's dressing rooms and the finale of the film was shot on the stage. The exterior of the New Victory Theater is shown in the 1998 film The Siege, when a bomb is detonated inside the theater by terrorists. For the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey were filmed outside the theater, on the staircase and on the main floor of the auditorium. These scenes were cut from the film but are included as deleted scenes on the DVD. An episode of Sex and the City filmed scenes in the theater. Video game The fa√ßade of The New Victory Theater is in the video game Grand Theft Auto IV. During the sequence in \\"Liberty City's\\" fictionalized 42nd Street/Times Square, the theater is featured. In the game, the theater is called the Liberteen and presents shows like Banging Trash Can Lids for an Hour.

Large species can be up to , not inclusive of legs and antennae, with body mass usually no more than . One gravid captive female reached a mass of about , making it one of the heaviest insects in the world and heavier than a sparrow. This is, however, abnormal, as this individual was unmated and retained an abnormal number of eggs. The largest species of giant wƒìtƒÅ is the Little Barrier Island giant wƒìtƒÅ, also known as the wƒìtƒÅpunga. One example reported in 2011 weighed .

Three arboreal giant wƒìtƒÅ species are found in the north of New Zealand and now restricted to mammal-free habitats, reason being, the declining abundance of most wƒìtƒÅ species, particularly Giant wƒìtƒÅ, can be attributed to the introduction of mammalian predators, habitat destruction, and habitat modification by introduced mammalian browsers. New populations of some wƒìtƒÅ have been established in locations, particularly on islands, where these threats have been eliminated or severely reduced in order to reduce the risk of extinction. Deinacrida heteracantha, and D. fallai are found only on near- shore islands that have no introduced predators (Te Haututu-o-Toi and Poor Knights Island). The closely related species D. mahoenui is restricted to habitat fragments in North Island. Two closely related giant wƒìtƒÅ species are less arboreal.

It involved five companies that had commercialized high-tech fermentation technologies, including American company Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Japanese companies Ajinomoto and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo, and Korean companies Sewon America Inc. and Cheil Jedang Ltd. A criminal investigation resulted in fines and three-year prison sentences for three executives of ADM who colluded with the other companies to fix prices. The foreign companies settled with the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division in September through December 1996. Each firm and four executives from the Asian firms pleaded guilty as part of a plea bargain to aid in further investigation against ADM. The cartel had been able to raise lysine prices 70% within their first nine months of cooperation.James M. Griffin, Deputy Assistant Attorney Gen., Antitrust Div., Dep't of Justice, The Modern Leniency Program After Ten Years: A Summary Overview of the Antitrust Division's Criminal Enforcement Program, Aug. 12, 2003 The investigation yielded $105 million in criminal fines, a record antitrust penalty at the time,John M. Connor, Global Price Fixing. Boston: Kluwer Academic (2001), p. 395. including a $70 million fine against ADM. ADM was fined an additional $30 million for its participation in a separate conspiracy in the citric acid market and paid a total fine of $100 million. Three former high-ranking ADM executives were convicted in September 1998 after a ten-week jury trial.An Antitrust Primer for Federal Law Enforcement Personnel, US Department of Justice, Antitrust division Buyers of lysine in the United States and Canada sued and recovered $80 to $100 million in damages from the five cartel members, and ADM paid $38 million to settle mismanagement suits by its shareholders.John M. Connor, Global Price Fixing. Boston: Kluwer Academic (2001), p. 481. The lysine cartel was the first successful prosecution of an international cartel by the U.S. Department of Justice in more than 40 years.John M. Connor, Global Price Fixing: Second Edition. Heidelberg: Springer-Verlag (2008), pp. 3-8. Since then, the DoJ has discovered and prosecuted scores of international cartels. ADM's role The company and senior ADM executives were indicted on federal criminal charges for simultaneously engaging in price-fixing in the international lysine and citric acid markets. Three of ADM's top officials, including vice chairman Michael D. Andreas, were eventually sentenced to federal prison in 1999 to a total of 99 months, an antitrust record at the time. Moreover, in 1997, the company was fined $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in U.S. history at the time. ADM was later fined almost $50 million by the antitrust authorities of Canada, Mexico, and the European Union.John M. Connor, Global Price Fixing. Boston: Kluwer Academic (2001), p. 536. The FBI learned of the lysine price- fixing conspiracy from Mark Whitacre, then Divisional President of ADM's BioProducts Division, because his wife threatened to inform the FBI if he did not. Whitacre only then told the FBI that he and other ADM executives were involved in price-fixing agreements with other rival businesses around the world. The FBI and Whitacre attended and listened in on the cartel‚Äôs meetings in cities such as Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and Hong Kong. During Whitacre's undercover tenure, the FBI collected hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes that documented crimes committed by executives from around the world fixing the prices of food additives in the largest price-fixing case in history at the time (1996). ADM ultimately settled federal charges for more than US$100 million and paid hundreds of millions of dollars more ($400 million alone on the high fructose corn syrup class action case) to plaintiffs and customers. Furthermore, several Asian and European lysine and citric acid producers that conspired to fix prices with ADM paid criminal fines in the tens of millions of dollars to the U.S. government. Several executives, including the former Vice Chairman of ADM, served time in federal prison as a result. The ADM investigation, in turn, convinced antitrust prosecutors that price-fixing was a far more pervasive problem than they had suspected and led to prosecutions of cartels in vitamins, fax paper, and graphite electrodes. European and Canadian regulators have started to crack down on the problem, too. Once a crime that rarely attracted the notice of federal authorities, price-fixing is now under attack by governments around the world. Billions of dollars have already been paid in antitrust fines to the U.S. government since Whitacre first blew the whistle in 1992. The investigation and prosecution of ADM and some of its executives has been reported to be one of the \\"best documented corporate crimes in American history\\". Whitacre was later charged with and pleaded guilty to committing a $9 million fraud that occurred during the same time period he was working for the FBI. Popular adaptations The Informant is a nonfiction thriller book written by journalist Kurt Eichenwald and published in 2000 by Random House that documents the case and the involvement of ADM executive Mark Whitacre. It has been adapted into the 2009 film The Informant! starring Matt Damon, which was released September 18, 2009.  See also  * United States v.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 3,972 and it contained 1,083 housing units. History Mission Township was given its name due to the church-riding ministers riding across to different churches in the township. One of these ministers, Jessie Walker, actually has a memorial at the United Methodist Church in Sheridan, which is the seat of the township. Geography The township is shares its western boundary with Serena Township, and its northern boundary with Northville Township. The township border is defined by where the Fox River goes southwest, turns south, then continues to go east, south, west, northwest, north, and then it then curves to go southwest again, forming an awkward \\"S\\" shape on the map. The community of Sheridan resides at the beginning of the bends in the river, and the community of Norway resides where the river flows north, and then curves around to flow southwest. Millington resides along the river, northeast of Sheridan. The community of Newark resides along the county line within Kendall County, but the community is no more than 4 to 5 miles away from the river.

George Frederick Muntz (26 November 1794 - 30 July 1857) was an industrialist from Birmingham, England and a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) for the Birmingham constituency from 1840 until his death. His father Philip Frederic Muntz came to England from Poland (now Lithuania) shortly after the French revolution, and lived at Selby Hall, Worcestershire. Philip Muntz established himself as a merchant and manufacturer in Birmingham, with the company, Muntz & Purden, specialising in steel toys. He married Catherine, daughter of his business partner Robert Purden, of Radford. George's younger brother, Philip Henry Muntz (1811 - 1888), J.P., M.P. for Birmingham, was the first head of the Muntz family of Edstone Hall, Warwickshire.A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain and Ireland, fifth edition, vol. II, Sir Bernard Burke, Harrison, Pall Mall, 1871, p. 962, 'Muntz of Umberslade' and 'Muntz of Edstone Hall' pedigrees As an industrialist, George Frederic Muntz developed Muntz Metal. This was a brass alloy intended to replace the copper that was then used to prevent fouling on ocean-going ships. Muntz was a supporter of political reform and a member of the Birmingham Political Union. In his actions that led to the Reform Act of 1832, he was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold: To stop the Duke, run for gold. He also was involved in a riot at Saint Martins in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838, but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming to be a republican, his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. Edwards wrote in 1877 of a conversation about a speech he made: > \\"They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim.\\" \\"Why not?\\" said I. > \\"Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's > enough\\". His home was at Umberslade Hall, in Tanworth in Arden. In the grounds of his estate, Muntz's son commissioned a church to be built which stands to this day, Umberslade Baptist Church. His descendants still live in the area and operate Umberslade Hall Children's Farm. He had seven sons and two daughters. The family business was continued by the eldest son, George Frederick junior together with Philip Albert Muntz,Samuel Timmins, 'Muntz, George Frederick (1794‚Äì1857)', rev. Matthew Lee, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 also a Member of Parliament who was created a Baronet in 1902 (see Muntz Baronets).

He first appeared in Adventure Comics #335 (August 1965) created by Edmond Hamilton and John Forte and was an enemy of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Fictional character biography=Lars Hanscom Starfinger was a helmeted figure with five different powers generated by each finger of his right hand. The Legion discovers that Starfinger is actually Lightning Lad, controlled by Dr. Lars Hanscom. Hanscom, under the guise of examining Lightning Lad's robotic arm, had hypnotized the Legionnaire and outfitted him with the Starfinger glove, so that Hanscom could obtain the rare metal rejuvium by threatening to destroy the \\"Seven Wonders of the 30th Century\\". Hanscom was brought to justice; after escaping prison, he briefly tried a criminal career on his own.Adventure Comics #336 His most notorious crime was the kidnapping of one of Duo Damsel's bodies during her wedding to Bouncing Boy.Superboy #200 (February 1974) He later tried as \\"Doctor Larsh\\" (Lars H.) to use Lightning Lad again on the eve of the birth of the Legionnaire's twins, but was easily defeated. Char Burrane Young Science Police cadet Gim Allon was on Mars chasing a fugitive just moments prior to the meteor strike that would imbue him with the growth powers he would use to become a Legionnaire. That criminal, Char Burrane would later escape again, and while fleeing across the Martian surface, would stumble upon a mysterious ring which was capable of generating two super- powered women, identifying themselves as Starlight and Starbright who originated from a micro world contained within the ring itself. With their powers, Burrane then begins building a criminal empire. Years later, he claims the name of Starfinger and has Hanscom killed on Takron-Galtos II to announce his arrival.Legion of Super-Heroes (3rd series) #29 (December 1986) Displaying an obvious vendetta against Colossal Boy, the new Starfinger battles the Legion and ultimately captures his personal nemesis and an undercover Chameleon Boy (acting on his own as Legion Espionage Leader). Overwhelmed by the subsequent team of rescuing Legionnaires, Starfinger flees to the secret world within his ring. Shrinking Violet discovers the ring, which is then heavily guarded.Legion of Super-Heroes (3rd series) ANNUAL #4 (1988) Molock Hanscom In the fourth volume of the Legion of Super-Heroes series, Molock Hanscom (formerly the leader of the Cosmic Spy League and brother of Lars) takes on the Starfinger role by arranging the assassination of Burrane. He sends killers (including the Persuader) after Char Burrane II to capture his predecessor's ring, and ultimately becomes successful in acquiring the artifact. Starfinger III is killed by the Khunds.Legion of Super-Heroes (4th series) #57 (May 1994)  Powers and abilities  Starfinger's right hand has five star tipped fingers, each of which can project different energy rays. Each ray has a different property: *Thumb - projects a neutralizing ray *Index finger - projects super-lightning *Middle finger - projects a super-thrust ray *Ring finger - tuneable and can project any kind of super-radiation (e.g. heat, Green kryptonite, gamma rays, shrinking rays, etc.) *Pinky - projects a freezing ray Using all the fingers together projects a distorting ray that scrambles superpowers and makes them function erratically. In other media * The Char Burrane version of Starfinger appears in the Legion of Super-Heroes episode \\"The Substitutes\\" voiced by Taylor Negron. He is portrayed as arrogant and narcissistic with a thick, and comically near-incomprehensible, Spanish accent. Starfinger wears a pair of mechanical gloves that have a different power in each finger. One finger has the ability to create small furry creatures which (unknown even to him) grow into monsters that eat the Earth's ionosphere. With the Legion busy trying to save the ionosphere, the Legion of Substitute Heroes are left to fight Starfinger. The \\"Subs\\" are able to subdue Starfinger and help the Legion stop the destruction of the ionosphere. In this episode, Brainiac 5 characterizes Starfinger as a \\"third-rate nuisance\\".Legion of Super-Heroes episode \\"The Substitutes\\" He makes two additional appearances in the companion comic book title, The Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century.

It instituted a number of reforms in the process of running the central government of the Roman Catholic Church, as article 1 states \\"The Roman Curia is the complex of dicasteries and institutes which help the Roman Pontiff in the exercise of his supreme pastoral office for the good and service of the whole Church and of the particular Churches. It thus strengthens the unity of the faith and the communion of the people of God and promotes the mission proper to the Church in the world\\". Background John Paul II Pastor bonus laid out in considerable detail the organization of the Roman Curia, specifying precisely the names and composition of each dicastery, and enumerating which competencies, or responsibilities, each dicastery was charged with overseeing. It replaced the previous governing document, Regimini Ecclesiae universae, which was released by Paul VI in 1967. It delineated the roles of the Secretariat of State, Congregations, Tribunals, Pontifical Councils, Administrative Services and Pontifical Commissions of the Roman Curia. It also established the norms for the ad limina visits of bishops to Rome and the relationship between the Holy See and the particular Churches and episcopal conferences.  Changes  Among the changes formulated in the constitution was the re-integration of the Council for Public Affairs of the Church into the Secretariat of State as the Section for Relations with States (the Second Section). The Council for Public Affairs of the Church had previously been a section of the Secretariat of State, but was made an independent dicastery by Pope Paul VI in 1967. The constitution also opened membership in dicasteries to priests, deacons, religious, and lay persons. For centuries, only cardinals were eligible for membership in the organs of the Holy See, but Pope Paul VI allowed diocesan bishops to be members following calls for collegiality at the Second Vatican Council. Pastor bonus continued the opening of the central government of the church by allowing representatives of all the faithful to have a role in the Roman Curia. Modifications , Pastor bonus has been amended by ' in 2011, ' and ' in 2013, and ' in 2014. In the Apostolic Letter Ministrorum institutio of 16 January 2013, Pope Benedict XVI transferred the governance of seminaries from the Congregation for Catholic Education to the Congregation for the Clergy. On the same day the Apostolic Letter Fides per doctrinam transferred the competence of catechesis from the Congregation for Clergy to the Pontifical Council for Promoting New Evangelization. In October 2013, Pope Francis and his Council of Cardinals were reviewing Pastor bonus for possible further revisions. On 24 February 2014, Francis issued the Apostolic Letter ' establishing the Council for the Economy to oversee the administrative and financial structures and activities of the dicasteries of the Roman Curia, the institutions linked to the Holy See, and the Vatican City State. It also established the Secretariat for the Economy as a dicastery of the Roman Curia.  References  External links  *Original text *Full text, translated to English by Francis C.C.F. Kelly, James H.
