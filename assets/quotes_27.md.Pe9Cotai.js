He then bought a franchise in the CBA in May 1983. Stepien hired former Cavaliers assistant coach Gerald Oliver as the first coach and general manager of the Tornados.

He was the first professor of natural history at University College, Toronto and president of the Canadian Institute (now the Royal Canadian Institute). He was also the first editor of the Unitarian magazine The Inquirer.  Early life and ministries  Hincks was born on 16 April 1794 in Cork, Ireland, the son of Thomas Dix Hincks, an orientalist and naturalist, and Anne Boult. He was educated in Belfast and trained as a minister in Manchester College, York from 1810 to 1815. He served in Cork from 1815 to 1818, then moved to Exeter where he ministered from 1818 to 1822. In 1822 he joined the Unitarian church and served as a minister at Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel in Liverpool until 1827. He didn't work again as a minister until 1839, when he moved to London.  Teaching  In 1827 he returned to Manchester College, York to teach Mathematics and philosophy. While he was there he became involved with the Philosophical Radicals. He stayed there until 1834 and in 1839 took a break from teaching to resume his work with the church, serving in 1845 as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel in Hampstead. In 1849 he became the first professor of natural history at Queen's College, Cork, the same year as the college started teaching and 4 years after it was founded. While there he had a major role in the development of the botanical gardens, in which he hoped to represent all the known orders of plants that he could grow in the Irish climate. He was also involved in developing the museum and herbaria. In 1853 he travelled to Canada, where he became the first professor of natural history at University College, Toronto. This was a somewhat controversial appointment as he was chosen over Thomas Henry Huxley who had the backing of a number of well respected botanists including Charles Darwin. It was suspected that his success over Huxley was due to the influence of his brother Francis Hincks, who was Premier of the Province of Canada at the time. He was said to be well like by his students there, although his ideas and teaching style was often seen as outdated. He was strongly opposed to Darwinism, preferring the Quinarian taxonomic system.  Other work  Hincks was elected as a fellow of the Linnean Society, a society for the study of taxonomy and natural history, in 1826. In 1828, while teaching at Manchester College, York, he became the first Honorary Curator of Botany in the museum of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society (latterly known as the Yorkshire Museum). The society was formed in 1822 as a charitable organisation aimed at promoting the natural sciences, archaeology and history. Following the construction of the museum and its associated gardens, Hincks planned to organise the plants using de Candolle's system though only a small amount had been planted to this scheme by the time of his departure from the post. Hincks had spent most of time working with the herbarium collections rather than the gardens. While teaching and serving as a clergyman, Hincks also carried out editing and publishing work. He was the first editor of the Unitarian magazine The Inquirer from 1842 to 1847 during his time in London. His work there was influenced by his interest in education and his desire for an end to slavery and the death penalty. In Canada he served as president of the Canadian Institute from 1869 to 1871 and became editor of their journal, the Canadian Journal. Through this he published a number of books including:  Personal life  In 1817 Hincks married Maria Ann Yandell and together they had 8 children, five boys and three girls. One of their sons Thomas Hincks (1818‚Äì1899) followed in his fathers footsteps and also became a minister and naturalist. Yandell died in 1849 and Hincks remarried Sarah Maria sometime before leaving England, her maiden name is not known. William Hincks died in Toronto on 10 September 1871 at the age of 77.

Total six pieces were made. The vehicle was partly armoured. The initiative for the vehicle development came from the Finnish Defence Forces which sent an inquiry for a light off-road lorry to Sisu-Auto in April 1983. At the time the Defence Forces was planning to purchase of 1 000 such vehicles. Sisu-Auto handed over a prototype for testing at the end of year 1986.  Technical Data  Sisu- Auto opted two engine types: Deutz BF 6 L 913 and Valmet 411 DSJ. The latter one is in use in four vehicles. The gearbox is ZF-S5-35/2 which was connected to a reduction gear unit of Sisu's own design. The axles are portal type and they are equipped with disc brakes and CTI system. Unlike in Masi, the frame is stiff and the high travel of wheels is only carried out by suspension. The front axle is sprung with coil springs, the rear axle with parabolic leaf springs.  Characteristics  The tests showed that from its mobility the vehicle was the best in the market. The engine started in -25 ¬∞C. SA-110 went in 60 cm deep snow and 75‚Äì85 cm deep water without any problems. It could climb 30¬∞ hills and it drove over a pile of gravel with an angle of 25¬∞ with ease. Due to these characteristics, the vehicle was called ‚Ä≥Unimog killer‚Ä≥. The deficiencies were a too small engine power and a too low torque and also a too high noise level; the highest measured value in the cabin was 88 dB. The 9.4-metre turning circle was regarded too large and the ratios of the 3rd and 4th gear were criticised. The too high price of the vehicle was one reason why the serial production was not started. It cost 85% of the Masi and 50% of the price of Pasi.

Plot The film reverts 36 hours earlier after a man pulls up at a house and confronts another man at his front door. The tale centers on Harry, a freelancer who spends a great deal of time with his beloved female pup, Jolly. Owing a group of people a large amount of money for refusing to do them a favor, he plans to leave town to avoid the debt. One day when he returns home, Jolly is found dead. Stricken with grief and anger, Harry enlists the help of his close cousin Cecil to find Jolly's murderer, dragging him through a path of destruction. At a bar, they interrogate a rude bartender, Thomas, getting a lead on a man named Bachmeier, a regular visitor and suspect who was given Harry's address upon request. Harry snaps and shoots Thomas dead for that reason. Next, they track down known prostitute, Tina, who was recently seen with Bachmeier. Refusing to pay her for sex and written info, Cecil is shot by Tina in the hand with a gun, but Tina joins her friend Vicki in death when Harry shoots them, as he grows overly vengeful. The following stop takes Harry and Cecil to a law firm office, where they confront and wipe out three unscrupulous lawyers, Bobby, Eichelberger and Danny, for withholding info. The receptionist eventually tells them Bachmeier is at a wedding reception. There, Harry and Cecil show up uninvited and hold the people hostage, although Bachmeier is not present and his sister, Angela, informs them that her family is dysfunctional. After killing many people in attendance, assaulting Angela and shooting her husband, Gary, a man soon gives them Bachmeier's address. The film returns to the beginning.

The following article comprises a list of the characters appearing in the anime Saint Seiya Omega, a spinoff of Masami Kurumada's manga Saint Seiya. The characters are organized according to the factions they belong to, or as secondary characters that are affiliated to none. Main characters ;: , Satsuki Yukino (as child) :A 13-year-old boy (14 in Season 2), who is destined to become the Pegasus Bronze Saint in the future era. The main protagonist in the series, trained since his early childhood to become a Saint, Koga is rebellious but also compassionate. He is still unaware of the purpose of having become a Saint in an era of peace, and has yet to discover his destiny. He meets Seiya, who teaches him the importance of friendship. Despite being capable of dealing Light-based attacks, Koga is later revealed to originally command the element of Darkness and be a host for Abzu, the God of Darkness. During the final battle against Abzu, with his Pegasus Cloth damaged, he dons Seiya's Sagittarius Cloth and defeats the God of Darkness, expelling the darkness from his body. While recovering from his wounds from the battle with Abzu, Koga learns of the advent of the war with Pallas' army, but claims that his days as a saint are over with his cloth damaged beyond repair, until he is attacked by one of Pallas' Pallasites and with his Cosmo, he manages to revive the Pegasus Cloth in a new, reinforced form, returning to his duty as a Saint of Athena, and it later gets a second upgrade when he and his friends Cosmo combines into the that awakens their Omega Cloths. ;: :A 14-year-old boy (15 in Season 2), Koga's best friend and trusted partner, the Lionet Bronze Saint of the future generation. With a bright and cheerful personality, Souma is also emotional and prone to lose his temper, he commands the element of Fire. Souma seeks to avenge his father, a Silver Saint who was murdered by Mars' own daughter, Hornet Sonia, only to witness firsthand at the Darkness temple her own tragic history. Through a series of trials of battles, including training under the retired Unicorn Saint Jabu, Souma battles Sonia as the newly christened Scorpio Saint, attempting to both defeat and save her from her delusions. Despite attaining his Seventh Sense, he is unable to save Sonia from the out of control power of her Cloth, comforting her as she dies. After Mars' defeat, he becomes an instructor at the Paleastra until the appearance of the Pallasites forces him to return to battle. ;: :The female Saint of the Eagle constellation, a 13-year-old girl (14 in Season 2) and war orphan. Departing from Kurumada's manga, the Aquila Saint is ranked as a Bronze Saint in Omega. Yuna aims to become a true and strong Saint, but strongly opposes the implied rule that female Saints should remain in a life of secrecy. She originally wore the mask of the female Saints, mandatory for them in the presence of males, but now fights without a mask. She commands the element of Wind and later learns to perform a dual attack with Souma, combining their cosmo into a massive, spiraling wave of flames. ;: :A 12-year-old boy (13 in Season 2), friend to Koga, who considers him almost his brother, the Dragon Bronze Saint in the future era. Very caring of others by nature, Ryuhou suffers from a frail health. Calm and polite, he has a natural talent for becoming a formidable Saint, but he is affected by his condition. He received the Dragon Cloth from his father, the legendary Dragon Shiryu. The young Ryuhou commands the element of Water. After Genbu's death, Geki entrusts the Libra Cloth to Ryuhou so that he can give it to his father. ;: :The young Bronze Saint of the Wolf constellation. Descendant of shinobi, a smart and knowledgeable 13-year-old boy (14 in Season 2). Stoic, Haruto aims to become a strong Saint. With a calm personality, he blends the shinobi arts with the ancient fighting style of the Saints. He becomes a singer after the battle with Mars, although returns to being the Wolf Saint after his first public show is ruined by the Pallasites. He commands the element of Earth. ;: :An enigmatic young man, the Orion Saint in the future era. Eden is 15 years old (16 in Season 2). Mysterious and distant, Eden believes in the dominance of the strong and disregards the weak, putting his faith in his own strength. Unlike in Kurumada's mythos, in which the Orion Saint belongs to the Silver Saint ranks, in Omega, the Orion Saint is ranked as a Bronze Saint. He is later revealed to be Mars' son and Sonia's younger brother, Eden defeats Koga in a battle of strength taking Aria back to Mars and is later shown heartbroken at Aria's death at the hands of his own father, eventually deciding to join forces with Koga and the others to stop his plans. Following the defeat of Abzu, Eden starts working with Pallas' servants and join their ranks as a Teriary Pallasite, wielding a club called the , upon being promised by them that they shall eventually revive Aria and his family for him. However it is revealed that he never intended to align with them and was working as a spy for the Sanctuary, and in the occasion, he discards his Chronetector and dons his new Orion Cloth. Eden commands the element of Thunder. After protecting Koga and the others from Europa, he finally decides to travel along with them while keeping an eye on Subaru who surprised him with a massive amount of Cosmo. When Koga and the other Bronze Saints meet Celeris and Selene, Eden learns what it means to have someone to protect. Eden is very much like Ikki in the original series: he usually keeps a distance from his fellow Bronze Saints and appears to help when it is most crucial. However, he also is very caring for his friends as he protects them from Europa's Terrible Slash, and his friendship with the other Saints increases during the series. ;: :Aria is a girl who commands the element of Light. She was one of the two infants that Athena protected from Erebus during Seiya's fight with Mars, the other being Koga. In the occasion, she was bathed in Athena's Light and inherited her powers. She was being raised by Mars since then to develop her Light powers as part of his plans to replace Saori with her as the new Athena. After being rescued by Koga, she travels with him and his friends to destroy the several ruins used by Mars to siphon the planet's Cosmo. After the final ruin is destroyed, Aria displays a power comparable with Athena's and makes use of it to confront Mars, but is ultimately killed by him and has her powers absorbed. ;: :An energetic twelve-year-old young boy with no memories of his past. Originally a Steel Saint with no memories of his past, Subaru dreams of one day become as powerful as a god. He has little sense of duty towards Athena at first, determined to prove himself by defeating Koga, who became notorious following his triumph over Abzu, but eventually becomes more responsible and friendly during his travels with him. Among the Steel Saints, Subaru has the strongest Cosmo, and it is hinted that he might eventually obtain his own guardian constellation and become one of Athena's Saints. This is confirmed when he eventually learns to perform his own Cosmo-powered technique known as the Pleiades Impact and inherits the Equuleus Clothstone from a dying Celeris. The true nature of Subaru's powers are shrouded in mystery as he sometimes displays surges of overwhelming Cosmo when he is overtaken with fury and manages to restore and upgrade the Equuleus Cloth despite not having achieved the Seventh Sense, drawing the attention of Eden, who finds something familiar in his Cosmo. He is ultimately revealed to be Saturn, having turned himself into a human boy to bide his time.

After convalescing from her wounds caused by Mars, she reveals to Koga the secret of his and Aria's origin, although the attack left her unable to use her cloth.

Genbu arrives to the Lushan waterfall to retrieve the Libra Gold Cloth, which he considers rightfully his, as the Libra Gold Saint. He is revealed to have been a former student of Dohko and originally left the path of a Saint, only to carry on the path Shiryu would have originally taken had he not lost all of his senses. As Genbu states, the Libra Cloth chose him to be the bearer, which he now uses on Athena's behalf just like Dohko and Shiryu did before him. After defeating Aquarius Tokisada, he decides to join the Bronze Saints' fight but when Medea upsets the balance that maintains the Twelve Houses, he is forced to stay behind to prevent them from collapse.

Harbinger was later recruited by Capricorn Ionia to become a Gold Saint. Even though the Bronze Saints fail to defeat him, he allows them to pass, claiming that he hopes to fight them once more when they grow stronger. Harbinger remains the Taurus Saint following Mars' defeat, and despite being considered the least reliable of all the remaining Gold Saints, Harbinger is entrusted with Athena's Cloth by Saori, with orders to protect it until the time comes for her to use it. After the battle with Pallas and Saturn he is entrusted with the role of Great Pope and rebuild the sanctuary, a position he begrudgingly accepts. ; : :The Gemini Gold Saint in the era of Omega. Abandoned by her parents at an early age, Paradox's life was saved in the past by Dragon Shiryu, which led her to become a Saint.

Ryuhou attempts to return the Dragon Cloth to him, although Shiryu declines, claiming that it now belongs to his son. Having no Cloth to fight the Pallasites, Shiryu stands on the backlines during the attack on Pallasvelda, attending to the wounded Saints, until his son gives him the Libra Clothstone, allowing Shiryu to officially assume the title of the Libra Saint.

As of 2013, there are 240 protected areas in the Philippines covering a total area of ‚Äì 14.2% of the Philippines' total area. History The first important legislation that formed the basis of the current system of national parks and protected areas in the Philippines is the Philippine Commission Act No. 648 enacted in 1903 by the US Congress. This act authorized the Civil Governor to \\"reserve for civil public purposes, and from sale or settlement, any part of the public domain not appropriated by law for special public purposes.\\" A total of eight national reserves had been established on July 26, 1904 pursuant to this law. These are: Lamao Forest Reserve in Bataan, Mariquina Reserve in Rizal, Angat River Reserve in Bulacan, Caliraya Falls Reserve in Laguna, La Carlota Reserve in Negros Occidental, San Ramon Reserve in Zamboanga, Magalang Reserve in Pampanga, and Hacienda San Antonio in Isabela. In the same year, the Forest Act of 1904 (Act No. 1148) was adopted that expanded the scope of protected areas in the Philippines. Among the first of such mountain forest reserves to be declared was Mount Maquiling declared on November 21, 1910. On February 1, 1932, the National Parks Act (Act No. 3195) was enacted that formally established the national parks system in the country. Mount Arayat became the first national park in the Philippines established on June 27, 1933 following this act. A series of acts and legislations were passed in the next decades that aimed to further strengthen these policies, including the Revised Forestry Code of 1975 (Presidential Decree No. 705) and Forest Administrative Order No. 7. Following the 1987 Constitution, the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act was enacted which further enhanced the administration and classification of protected areas, and broadened the mandate of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in enforcing its provisions.  Classification  Protected areas in the Philippines encompasses of terrestrial areas and of marine areas. They are managed according to the following classifications described in Section 4 of the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992 (NIPAS Act).

Successively redeveloped, the fort was used first by Bermudian Militia and then by regular Royal Artillery units from 1612 into the 20th century. Today it houses a museum. Militia forts 1624 Map of Bermuda, with illustrations of fortifications and important sites, including Fort St. Catherine's at top, left The first fort was built on the site from wood in 1612. This was replaced by a stone fort in 1614. It was one of a number of forts built immediately following the Virginia Company being given official sanction in 1612 for its possession of Bermuda, which it had occupied since the wreck of the Sea Venture in 1609. The first forts were built around St. George's Harbour, followed closely by forts on Castle Harbour, the Castle Islands Fortifications. These forts include the oldest surviving buildings, the oldest surviving fortifications, the oldest surviving house (a fort commander's house), also the first stone forts, the first stone house, and the first coastal artillery built by the English in the New World. While most of these forts were designed to prevent an enemy entering St. George's Harbour, either directly from the open Atlantic, or via Castle Harbour, Fort St. Catherine's, was placed in a location to prevent vessels which had entered through the reefline from the open Atlantic via the main shipping channel from rounding St. George's Island and moving to Westward. Vessels passing this way are constrained by the surrounding reeflines, and must travel near to shore, and cannot take evasive manoeuvres, making the site a very useful one for coastal artillery. Use by the Regular Army An RML 10 inch 18 ton gun at Fort St Catherine The fort was rebuilt five times, the last time at the end of the 19th Century, by when Bermuda had become the premier base for the Royal Navy in the Western Hemisphere, requiring a large military garrison with numerous forts and batteries to protect it. Ultimately, the fort's exposed position made it more vulnerable than later forts, often designed to be protected from fire, and obscured from view, by earthworks. These included Fort Victoria and Fort Albert, on the hill directly behind Fort St. Catherines. In the 20th Century, Fforts fell out of favour, and most of the coastal artillery still in use was placed in batteries with only minimal fortification, like the St. David's Battery, Alexandra Battery, and Warwick Camp Battery. The 10 inch RMLs at Fort St. Catherine were not replaced as the 9.2 inch RBLs placed at Fort Victoria made St. Catherine's and Fort Albert unnecessary. the RMLs were pushed over the side of the fort in the 1940s and have lain since rusting on the surrounding slopes and shoreline. The 10 inch RMLs now mounted in the fort were taken from Fort Albert in the 1960s. Post- Military Use In the 1950s, a production of Macbeth was staged at Fort St. Catherine's starring Charlton Heston. Today, the fort houses a museum dedicated to Bermudian history, particularly the military aspect. As a result of their historical significance, with fortifications spanning the full four centuries of English settlement in the New World, the forts at the East End of Bermuda, together with St. George's Town (or the Town of St. George), have been made a UNESCO World Heritage Site (the Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications). It also houses Slazo's Earth Sandwich. ReferencesBibliography * Defence, Not Defiance: A History Of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, Jennifer M. Ingham (now Jennifer M.

Plot summary Alex is an actress who is attracted to her co-star Jamie, who stars alongside her in a local theater play. Alex is also married to an independent musician named Elliott. When Elliott goes on tour with his music, Alex lets Jamie sleep on her couch and flirts with him. Alex continues to fall in love with Jamie while Jamie has a relationship with her sister. The film concludes with Alex being remorseful for her actions. Production Swanberg stated that he worked \\"more collaboratively\\" with other people than he did on his earlier films. The producers were Anish Savhani and Noah Baumbach. Baumbach was Swanberg's main off-set creative consultant and he helped with the film after viewing the director's previous film Hannah Takes the Stairs. Working with Baumbach made Swanberg become a more self-confident director. Swanberg said that his films need to provide what does not exist, while also competing with the moments that are on YouTube and Facebook. He also said, \\"Alexander The Last is when I‚Äôve reached my conclusions about certain things\\". The film was shot with a HD Handycam. The leads in the film are also the screenwriters. Release Alexander the Last debuted at the South by Southwest film festival and as a part of IFC Films Festival Direct video on demand service on March 14, 2009. The film was released on DVD in 2010 with some deleted scenes that are hosted by Swanberg. Reception Richard Brody of The New Yorker wrote, \\"Alexander the Last is a significant advance over Swanberg‚Äôs other films; his camera work‚Äîand he does indeed do the camera work‚Äîis more careful and more controlled, and his images are by and large more expressive, not merely revelatory of performance (as they were, for the most part, in his earlier films).

He was a patrilineal great-grandson of Afonso I, Duke of Braganza, an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, as well as a descendant of King Henry II of Castile and Ferdinand I of Portugal. He studied law and canon law. He had a close relationship with Queen Isabella I of Castile and was with her in her final hours, signing her last will and testament as a witness. After her death, he became a counselor of her widower, King Ferdinand II of Aragon. Due to his commitment to the royal family, the Archbishop strongly supported Isabella and Ferdinand's daughter Joanna upon her accession to her parents' thrones and also supported the accession of her son, Charles I, as her co-ruler. King Charles I kept him as royal counselor. He started his ecclesiastical career as canon of Segorbe and Albarracin, becoming bishop of Calahorra in 1503 and remaining in that post until 1508, when he was named bishop of Segovia. He served as such until 1511. In 1512, he became bishop of Sig√ºenza. Charles I appointed him viceroy of Catalonia and captain-general of Catalonia, Cerdanya and Roussillon in 1525. He produced numerous works and commissioned the decoration of several churches. Finally, in 1532, he was made archbishop of Zaragoza, but he never visited the city itself. He died in Barcelona on 15 January 1539 and was transferred to the Cathedral of Santa Maria de Sig√ºenza, where he was buried in the mausoleum that bears his name.

The DUDE was proposed in 2005 by Tsachy Weissman, Erik Ordentlich, Gadiel Seroussi, Sergio Verd√∫ and Marcelo J. Weinberger.T. Weissman, E. Ordentlich, G. Seroussi, S. Verdu ÃÅ, and M.J. Weinberger. Universal discrete denoising: Known channel. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,, 51(1):5‚Äì28, 2005. Overview The Discrete Universal Denoiser (DUDE) is a denoising scheme that estimates an unknown signal x^n=\\\\left( x_1 \\\\ldots x_n \\\\right) over a finite alphabet from a noisy version z^n=\\\\left( z_1 \\\\ldots z_n \\\\right). While most denoising schemes in the signal processing and statistics literature deal with signals over an infinite alphabet (notably, real-valued signals), the DUDE addresses the finite alphabet case. The noisy version z^n is assumed to be generated by transmitting x^n through a known discrete memoryless channel. For a fixed context length parameter k, the DUDE counts of the occurrences of all the strings of length 2k+1 appearing in z^n. The estimated value \\\\hat{x}_i is determined based the two-sided length-k context \\\\left( z_{i-k}, \\\\ldots, z_{i-1},z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots,z_{i+k} \\\\right) of z_i, taking into account all the other tokens in z^n with the same context, as well as the known channel matrix and the loss function being used. The idea underlying the DUDE is best illustrated when x^n is a realization of a random vector X^n. If the conditional distribution X_i  Z_{i-k}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i-1}, Z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i+k}, namely the distribution of the noiseless symbol X_i conditional on its noisy context \\\\left( Z_{i-k}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i-1},Z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots,Z_{i+k} \\\\right) was available, the optimal estimator \\\\hat{X}_i would be the Bayes Response to X_i  Z_{i-k}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i-1}, Z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i+k}. Fortunately, when the channel matrix is known and non-degenerate, this conditional distribution can be expressed in terms of the conditional distribution Z_i  Z_{i-k}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i-1}, Z_{i+1}, \\\\ldots, Z_{i+k}, namely the distribution of the noisy symbol Z_i conditional on its noisy context. This conditional distribution, in turn, can be estimated from an individual observed noisy signal Z^n by virtue of the Law of Large Numbers, provided n is ‚Äúlarge enough‚Äù. Applying the DUDE scheme with a context length k to a sequence of length n over a finite alphabet \\\\mathcal{Z} requires O(n) operations and space O\\\\left( \\\\min( n , \\\\mathcal{Z}^{2k} ) \\\\right). Under certain assumptions, the DUDE is a universal scheme in the sense of asymptotically performing as well as an optimal denoiser, which has oracle access to the unknown sequence. More specifically, assume that the denoising performance is measured using a given single-character fidelity criterion, and consider the regime where the sequence length n tends to infinity and the context length k=k_n tends to infinity ‚Äúnot too fast‚Äù. In the stochastic setting, where a doubly infinite sequence noiseless sequence \\\\mathbf{x} is a realization of a stationary process \\\\mathbf{X}, the DUDE asymptotically performs, in expectation, as well as the best denoiser, which has oracle access to the source distribution \\\\mathbf{X}. In the single-sequence, or ‚Äúsemi-stochastic‚Äù setting with a fixed doubly infinite sequence \\\\mathbf{x}, the DUDE asymptotically performs as well as the best ‚Äúsliding window‚Äù denoiser, namely any denoiser that determines \\\\hat{x}_i from the window \\\\left( z_{i-k},\\\\ldots,z_{i+k} \\\\right), which has oracle access to \\\\mathbf{x}. The discrete denoising problem Block diagram description of the discrete denoising problem Let \\\\mathcal{X} be the finite alphabet of a fixed but unknown original ‚Äúnoiseless‚Äù sequence x^n=\\\\left( x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}^n. The sequence is fed into a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). The DMC operates on each symbol x_i independently, producing a corresponding random symbol Z_i in a finite alphabet \\\\mathcal{Z}. The DMC is known and given as a \\\\mathcal{X}-by-\\\\mathcal{Z} Markov matrix \\\\Pi, whose entries are \\\\pi(x,z)=\\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left( Z=z \\\\,\\\\, X=x \\\\right). It is convenient to write \\\\pi_z for the z-column of \\\\Pi. The DMC produces a random noisy sequence Z^n=\\\\left( z_1,\\\\ldots,z_n \\\\right)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Z}^n. A specific realization of this random vector will be denoted by z^n. A denoiser is a function \\\\hat{X}^n: \\\\mathcal{Z}^n \\\\to \\\\mathcal{X}^n that attempts to recover the noiseless sequence x^n from a distorted version z^n. A specific denoised sequence is denoted by \\\\hat{x}^n=\\\\hat{X}^n\\\\left( z^n \\\\right)=\\\\left( \\\\hat{X}_1 (z^n),\\\\ldots , \\\\hat{X}_n(z^n) \\\\right). The problem of choosing the denoiser \\\\hat{X}^n is known as signal estimation, filtering or smoothing. To compare candidate denoisers, we choose a single-symbol fidelity criterion \\\\Lambda:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to [0,\\\\infty) (for example, the Hamming loss) and define the per-symbol loss of the denoiser \\\\hat{X}^n at (x^n,z^n) by \\\\begin{align} L_{\\\\hat{X}^n}\\\\left( x^n,z^n \\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\Lambda\\\\left( x_i \\\\, , \\\\, \\\\hat{X}_i(z^n) \\\\right) \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Ordering the elements of the alphabet \\\\mathcal{X} by \\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\left( a_1 , \\\\ldots , a_{\\\\mathcal{X}} \\\\right), the fidelity criterion can be given by a \\\\mathcal{X}-by-\\\\mathcal{X} matrix, with columns of the form \\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}} = \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\Lambda(a_1,\\\\hat{x}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Lambda(a_{\\\\mathcal{X}},\\\\hat{x}) \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\,. \\\\end{align} The DUDE scheme=Step 1: Calculating the empirical distribution in each context The DUDE corrects symbols according to their context. The context length k used is a tuning parameter of the scheme. For k+1\\\\leq i\\\\leq n-k, define the left context of the i-th symbol in z^n by l^k(z^n,i)=\\\\left( z_{i-k},\\\\ldots,z_{i-1} \\\\right) and the corresponding right context as r^k(z^n,i)=\\\\left( z_{i+1},\\\\ldots,z_{i+k} \\\\right). A two-sided context is a combination (l^k,r^k) of a left and a right context. The first step of the DUDE scheme is to calculate the empirical distribution of symbols in each possible two-sided context along the noisy sequence z^n. Formally, a given two-sided context (l^k,r^k)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Z}^k\\\\times \\\\mathcal{Z}^k that appears once or more along z^n determines an empirical probability distribution over \\\\mathcal{Z}, whose value at the symbol z is \\\\begin{align} \\\\mu \\\\left( z^n,l^k,r^k \\\\right)[z] = \\\\frac{\\\\Big \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ k+1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n-k \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, ( z_{i-k},\\\\ldots,z_{i+k})=l^k z r^k \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\Big} {\\\\Big \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ k+1\\\\leq i \\\\leq n-k \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, l^k(z^n,i)=l^k \\\\text{ and } r^k(z^n,i)=r^k\\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\Big} \\\\,. \\\\end{align} Thus, the first step of the DUDE scheme with context length k is to scan the input noisy sequence z^n once, and store the length-\\\\mathcal{Z} empirical distribution vector \\\\mu \\\\left( z^n,l^k,r^k \\\\right) (or its non-normalized version, the count vector) for each two-sided context found along z^n. Since there are at most N_{n,k}=\\\\min\\\\left( n,\\\\mathcal{Z}^{2k} \\\\right) possible two-sided contexts along z^n, this step requires O(n) operations and storage O(N_{n,k}). Step 2: Calculating the Bayes response to each context Denote the column of single-symbol fidelity criterion \\\\Lambda, corresponding to the symbol \\\\hat{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}, by \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}. We define the Bayes Response to any vector \\\\mathbf{v} of length \\\\mathcal{X} with non-negative entries as \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\text{argmin}_{\\\\hat{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} This definition is motivated in the background below. The second step of the DUDE scheme is to calculate, for each two-sided context (l^k,r^k) observed in the previous step along z^n, and for each symbol z\\\\in\\\\mathcal{Z} observed in each context (namely, any z such that l^rzr^k is a substring of z^n) the Bayes response to the vector \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mu\\\\left( z^n\\\\,,\\\\,l^k\\\\,,\\\\,r^k \\\\right)\\\\odot \\\\pi_{z}, namely \\\\begin{align} g(l^k,z,r^k) := \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes} \\\\left( \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mu\\\\left( z^n\\\\,,\\\\,l^k\\\\,,\\\\,r^k \\\\right)\\\\odot \\\\pi_{z} \\\\right)\\\\,. \\\\end{align} Note that the sequence z^n and the context length k are implicit. Here, \\\\pi_z is the z-column of \\\\Pi and for vectors \\\\mathbf{a} and \\\\mathbf{b}, \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\odot\\\\mathbf{b} denotes their Schur (entrywise) product, defined by \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{a}\\\\odot\\\\mathbf{b}\\\\right)_i = a_i b_i. Matrix multiplication is evaluated before the Schur product, so that \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mu\\\\odot\\\\pi_z stands for (\\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mu)\\\\odot\\\\pi_z. This formula assumed that the channel matrix \\\\Pi is square (\\\\mathcal{X}=\\\\mathcal{Z}) and invertible. When \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\leq\\\\mathcal{Z} and \\\\Pi is not invertible, under the reasonable assumption that it has full row rank, we replace (\\\\Pi^\\\\top)^{-1} above with its Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse \\\\left( \\\\Pi\\\\Pi^\\\\top \\\\right)^{-1}\\\\Pi and calculate instead \\\\begin{align} g(l^k,z,r^k):=\\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\left( (\\\\Pi\\\\Pi^\\\\top)^{-1}\\\\Pi \\\\mu\\\\left( z^n,l^k,r^k \\\\right)\\\\odot \\\\pi_z \\\\right)\\\\,. \\\\end{align} By caching the inverse or pseudo-inverse \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}, and the values \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}\\\\odot \\\\pi_z for the relevant pairs (\\\\hat{x},z)\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\times\\\\mathcal{Z}, this step requires O(N_{k,n}) operations and O(N_{k,n}) storage. Step 3: Estimating each symbol by the Bayes response to its context The third and final step of the DUDE scheme is to scan z^n again and compute the actual denoised sequence \\\\hat{X}^n(z^n)=\\\\left( \\\\hat{X}_1(z^n), \\\\ldots , \\\\hat{X}_n(z^n) \\\\right) . The denoised symbol chosen to replace z_i is the Bayes response to the two-sided context of the symbol, namely \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{X}_i(z^n) := g\\\\left( l^k(z^n,i) \\\\,,\\\\, z_i \\\\,,\\\\, r^k(z^n,i)\\\\right)\\\\,.\\\\end{align} This step requires O(n) operations and used the data structure constructed in the previous step. In summary, the entire DUDE requires O(n) operations and O(N_{k,n}) storage. Asymptotic optimality properties The DUDE is designed to be universally optimal, namely optimal (is some sense, under some assumptions) regardless of the original sequence x^n. Let \\\\hat{X}^n_{DUDE}:\\\\mathcal{Z}^n\\\\to\\\\mathcal{X}^n denote a sequence of DUDE schemes, as described above, where \\\\hat{X}^n_{DUDE} uses a context length k_n that is implicit in the notation. We only require that \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}k_n=\\\\infty and that k_n \\\\mathcal{Z}^{2K_n}=o\\\\left( \\\\frac{n}{\\\\log n} \\\\right). For a stationary source Denote by \\\\mathcal{D}_n the set of all n-block denoisers, namely all maps \\\\hat{X}^n:\\\\mathcal{Z}^n\\\\to\\\\mathcal{X}^n. Let \\\\mathbf{X} be an unknown stationary source and \\\\mathbf{Z} be the distribution of the corresponding noisy sequence. Then \\\\begin{align} \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\mathbf{E}\\\\left[ L_{\\\\hat{X}^n_{DUDE}}\\\\left( X^n,Z^n \\\\right) \\\\right]= \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\min_{\\\\hat{X}^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}_n}\\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[L_{\\\\hat{X}^n}\\\\left( X^n,Z^n \\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\,, \\\\end{align} and both limits exist. If, in addition the source \\\\mathbf{X} is ergodic, then \\\\begin{align} \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} L_{\\\\hat{X}^n_{DUDE}}\\\\left( X^n,Z^n \\\\right) = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\min_{\\\\hat{X}^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}_n}\\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[L_{\\\\hat{X}^n}\\\\left( X^n,Z^n \\\\right)\\\\right]\\\\,,\\\\,\\\\text{ almost surely}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} For an individual sequence Denote by \\\\mathcal{D}_{n,k} the set of all n-block k-th order sliding window denoisers, namely all maps \\\\hat{X}^n:\\\\mathcal{Z}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{X} of the form \\\\hat{X}_i(z^n) = f\\\\left( z_{i-k},\\\\ldots,z_{i+k} \\\\right) with f:\\\\mathcal{Z}^{2k+1}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{X} arbitrary. Let \\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}^\\\\infty be an unknown noiseless sequence stationary source and \\\\mathbf{Z} be the distribution of the corresponding noisy sequence. Then \\\\begin{align} \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\left[ L_{\\\\hat{X}^n_{DUDE}}\\\\left( x^n,Z^n \\\\right) - \\\\min_{\\\\hat{X}^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}_{n,k}} L_{\\\\hat{X}^n}\\\\left( x^n,Z^n \\\\right) \\\\right ] =0 \\\\,,\\\\,\\\\text{ almost surely}\\\\,. \\\\end{align} Non-asymptotic performance Let \\\\hat{X}^n_{k} denote the DUDE on with context length k defined on n-blocks. Then there exist explicit constants A,C>0 and B>1 that depend on \\\\left( \\\\Pi,\\\\Lambda \\\\right) alone, such that for any n,k and any x^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}^n we have \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{A}{\\\\sqrt{n}}B^k\\\\,\\\\leq \\\\mathbf{E} \\\\left[ L_{\\\\hat{X}^n_{k}}\\\\left( x^n,Z^n \\\\right) - \\\\min_{\\\\hat{X}^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}_{n,k}} L_{\\\\hat{X}^n}\\\\left( x^n,Z^n \\\\right) \\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\sqrt{k}\\\\frac{C}{\\\\sqrt{n}} \\\\mathcal{Z}^{k} \\\\,, \\\\end{align} where Z^n is the noisy sequence corresponding to x^n (whose randomness is due to the channel alone) K. Viswanathan and E. Ordentlich. Lower limits of discrete universal denoising. IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 55(3):1374‚Äì1386, 2009. . In fact holds with the same constants A,B as above for any n-block denoiser \\\\hat{X}^n\\\\in\\\\mathcal{D}^n. The lower bound proof requires that the channel matrix \\\\Pi be square and the pair \\\\left( \\\\Pi,\\\\Lambda \\\\right) satisfies a certain technical condition. Background To motivate the particular definition of the DUDE using the Bayes response to a particular vector, we now find the optimal denoiser in the non-universal case, where the unknown sequence x^n is a realization of a random vector X^n, whose distribution is known. Consider first the case n=1. Since the joint distribution of (X,Z) is known, given the observed noisy symbol z, the unknown symbol X\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X} is distributed according to the known distribution \\\\mathbb{P}(X=xZ=z). By ordering the elements of \\\\mathcal{X}, we can describe this conditional distribution on \\\\mathcal{X} using a probability vector \\\\mathbf{P}_{Xz}, indexed by \\\\mathcal{X}, whose x-entry is \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left( X=xZ=z \\\\right). Clearly the expected loss for the choice of estimated symbol \\\\hat{x} is \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{P}_{Xz}. Define the Bayes Envelope of a probability vector \\\\mathbf{v}, describing a probability distribution on \\\\mathcal{X}, as the minimal expected loss U(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\min_{\\\\hat{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\top \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}, and the Bayes Response to \\\\mathbf{v} as the prediction that achieves this minimum, \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\text{argmin}_{\\\\hat{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\mathbf{v}^\\\\top \\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}. Observe that the Bayes response is scale invariant in the sense that \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}(\\\\mathbf{v}) = \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}(\\\\alpha\\\\mathbf{v}) for \\\\alpha>0. For the case n=1, then, the optimal denoiser is \\\\hat{X}(z)=\\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\left( \\\\mathbf{P}_{Xz} \\\\right). This optimal denoiser can be expressed using the marginal distribution of Z alone, as follows. When the channel matrix \\\\Pi is invertible, we have \\\\mathbf{P}_{Xz} \\\\propto \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}P_Z\\\\odot \\\\pi_z where \\\\pi_z is the z-th column of \\\\Pi. This implies that the optimal denoiser is given equivalently by \\\\hat{X}(z)=\\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\left( \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mathbf{P}_Z\\\\odot\\\\pi_z \\\\right). When \\\\mathcal{X}\\\\leq\\\\mathcal{Z} and \\\\Pi is not invertible, under the reasonable assumption that it has full row rank, we can replace \\\\Pi^{-1} with its Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse and obtain \\\\hat{X}(z)=\\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\left( (\\\\Pi\\\\Pi^\\\\top)^{-1}\\\\Pi\\\\mathbf{P}_Z\\\\odot\\\\pi_z \\\\right)\\\\,. Turning now to arbitrary n, the optimal denoiser \\\\hat{X}^{opt}(z^n) (with minimal expected loss) is therefore given by the Bayes response to \\\\mathbf{P}_{X_iz^n} \\\\begin{align} \\\\hat{X}^{opt}_i(z^n) = \\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\mathbf{P}_{X_iz^n} = \\\\text{argmin}_{\\\\hat{x}\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}}\\\\lambda_{\\\\hat{x}}^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{P}_{X_iz^n}\\\\,, \\\\end{align} where \\\\mathbf{P}_{X_iz^n} is a vector indexed by \\\\mathcal{X}, whose x-entry is \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left( X_i=x  Z^n=z^n \\\\right). The conditional probability vector \\\\mathbf{P}_{X_iz^n} is hard to compute. A derivation analogous to the case n=1 above shows that the optimal denoiser admits an alternative representation, namely \\\\hat{X}^{opt}_i(z^n)=\\\\hat{X}_{Bayes}\\\\left( \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top}\\\\mathbf{P}_{Z_i,z^{n\\\\backslash i}}\\\\odot\\\\pi_{z_i} \\\\right), where z^{n \\\\backslash i}=\\\\left( z_1,\\\\ldots,z_{i-1},z_{i+1},\\\\ldots,z_n \\\\right)\\\\in \\\\mathcal{Z}^{n-1} is a given vector and \\\\mathbf{P}_{Z_i,z^{n\\\\backslash i}} is the probability vector indexed by \\\\mathcal{Z} whose z-entry is \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\left( (Z_1,\\\\ldots,Z_n) = (z_1,\\\\ldots,z_{i-1},z,z_{i+1},\\\\ldots,z_n) \\\\right)\\\\,. Again, \\\\Pi^{-\\\\top} is replaced by a pseudo-inverse if \\\\Pi is not square or not invertible. When the distribution of X (and therefore, of Z) is not available, the DUDE replaces the unknown vector \\\\mathbf{P}_{Z_i,z^{n\\\\backslash i}} with an empirical estimate obtained along the noisy sequence z^n itself, namely with \\\\mu\\\\left( Z_i, l^k(Z^n,i),r^k(Z^n,i) \\\\right). This leads to the above definition of the DUDE. While the convergence arguments behind the optimality properties above are more subtle, we note that the above, combined with the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem, is enough to prove that for a stationary ergodic source, the DUDE with context-length k is asymptotically optimal all k-th order sliding window denoisers. Extensions The basic DUDE as described here assumes a signal with a one-dimensional index set over a finite alphabet, a known memoryless channel and a context length that is fixed in advance.

Partlow (June 8, 1911 ‚Äì April 19, 1987) was an American pitcher in Negro league baseball. He played between 1934 and 1951. Playing Career A left handed pitcher of great strength whose hitting kept the scouts on the edge of their seats, he was the third black signed in 1946 by Branch Rickey, president of the Brooklyn Dodgers. In order, Rickey signed Jackie Robinson, John Wright and Mr. Partlow. They were added to the roster of the Royals, his International League farm club in Montreal. It was about that time that the expansive Rickey signed Don Newcomb.Though Mr. Partlow quickly proved himself, maintaining his winning ways with Montreal through the 1949 season, he was left behind when the Dodgers called up Robinson. He waited patiently, but the call never came to play with the Dodgers. His widow and his children recall the period without bitterness. They remember his conversations with the front office, the talk about \\"more seasoning\\" and about the question of his age (he was 33 when he was first signed), and the usual, \\"We'll move you when you're ready.\\"Mr. Partlow, who was known as the strikeout king of Negro Leagues, was born in Washington, Ga., and educated in Cincinnati. He played there with the Cincinnati White Sox and the Cincinnati Tigers before joining the Homestead Grays.The hitting of \\"Silent Roy,\\" as he was known, was as powerful as his pitching. He took the Puerto Rican Winter League honors in 1940 with a .443 average. And in 1942, he pitched a no-hitter against Chicago's American Giants.He was playing for the Homestead Grays when World War II forced him from the diamond. He served in the Army and, at war's end, joined the Philadelphia Stars. It was 1945 and he had a good year. He participated in 17 games, winning nine, losing four and leading the National Negro League in strikeouts - 83. He caught Rickey's eye in a game at Ebbets Field between the all-stars of the National League and the National Negro League when he relieved Newcomb. Coming to the mound in the third inning, he was nicked for a hit by the first man he faced, Frank McCormick, who later joined the Phillies.But that was the last hit. He struck out Hal Gregg, Eddie Stanky and Goodie Rosen in one inning. He left the game in the eighth to give another pitcher a chance to show his stuff.Rickey signed him at the first opportunity.Sportswriters of the day who had watched the pitching duels that developed on occasion between Mr. Partlow and Sachel Paige in the Negro leagues applauded Rickey's move. They recognized his potential.\\"Silent Roy\\" enjoyed the play in Montreal until 1949. Then he decided to rejoin the Homestead Grays. The Grays were delighted to have him. He played for them for an additional four seasons and played in the Caribbean league during the winters.Then he gave it all up and went to work for the American Container Corp. He worked there until he retired.In Bums, the history of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Roy Campanella offered a to- the-point assessment of Mr. Partlow. \\"No one,\\" he said, \\"could beat Roy in pitching when he was in the mood.

The campaign began with Ming intervention in support of a rival faction to the H·ªì, but ended with incorporation of Vietnam into China, marking the start of the Ming province of Jiaozhi. A few years earlier, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly (ËÉ°Â≠£Áäõ) had usurped the throne of the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty, which ultimately led to the intercession of the Ming government to reestablish the Tr·∫ßn dynasty. However, H·ªì forces attacked the Ming convoy escorting a Tr·∫ßn pretender, and all were killed in the attack. After this event, the Yongle Emperor appointed Marquises Zhang Fu (Chinese: ÂºµËºî, Vietnamese: Tr∆∞∆°ng Ph·ª•) and Mu Sheng (Chinese: Ê≤êÊôü, Vietnamese: M·ªôc Th·∫°nh) to prepare and lead the Ming armies for the invasion of ƒê·∫°i Ngu. The war lasted from 1406 to 1407, resulting in the Ming conquest of ƒê·∫°i Ngu and the capture of the members of the H·ªì dynasty.  Background  The Edict for invade Annam by Yongle Emperor wrote in May 1406. The former ruling dynasty of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát, the Tr·∫ßn, had tributary relations with the Ming Empire.. However, in 1400, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly deposed and massacred the Tr·∫ßn house before usurping the throne. After taking the throne, H·ªì renamed the country from ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát to ƒê·∫°i Ngu.. In 1402, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son, H·ªì H√°n Th∆∞∆°ng (ËÉ°Êº¢Ëíº).. Eventually, in May 1403, he requested the investiture of his son from the Ming government on the account that the Tr·∫ßn lineage had died out and that his son was a royal nephew. The Ming government, unaware of the deeds that H·ªì had committed against the Tr·∫ßn, granted him this request. In October 1404, Tr·∫ßn Thi√™m B√¨nh arrived at the Ming imperial court in Nanjing, claiming to be a Tr·∫ßn prince. He notified the court of the treacherous events that had taken place and appealed to the court for the restoration of his throne.. No action was taken by them until early 1405 when his story was confirmed by a Vietnamese envoy. The Yongle Emperor of the Ming Empire issued an edict reprimanding the usurper and demanding the restoration of the Tr·∫ßn throne.. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly had doubts about the pretender's claims, but nevertheless acknowledged his crimes and agreed to receive the pretender as king. Thus, the nominal king was escorted back by a Ming envoy in a military convoy. On 4 April 1406, as the party crossed the border into L·∫°ng S∆°n, H·ªì's forces ambushed them and killed the Tr·∫ßn prince that the Ming convoy were escorting back.. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly expected the Ming Empire to retaliate, so he prepared the military for the imminent Ming invasion. He also took on a hostile foreign policy, which included harassing the southern border of the Ming Empire.  War  On 11 May (according to ) or in the month July (according to ) 1406, the Yongle Emperor appointed Duke Zhu Neng (Êú±ËÉΩ, Duke of Cheng) to lead an invasion with Marquises Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng as second-in-command. Chen Qia (Èô≥Ê¥Ω) was appointed to oversee the supplies, while Huang Fu (ÈªÉÁ¶è) was appointed to handle political and administrative affairs.. On the eve of departure, the Yongle Emperor gave a banquet at the Longjiang naval arsenal, located at the Qinhuai River in Nanjing. Huang Fu kept a log to document the military campaign. Sixteen days before the Yongle Emperor gave the banquet at Longjiang, Huang Fu had departed from Nanjing and spend a night at Longjiang, before sailing west on the Yangtze River. After eight days, he reached Poyang Lake; after another week, he reached Dongting Lake. Thereafter, Huang traveled through the Xiang River southwards, passing Xiangtan and Guilin, heading towards Nanning in Guangxi. Three months had passed after his departure from Nanjing, when Huang arrived at Longzhou in Guangxi, where he joined the main body of the Ming forces. Zhu Neng and Zhang Fu would cross the border from Guangxi, while Mu Sheng would invade the Red River Delta from Yunnan. However, Zhu Neng died, aged 36, at Longzhou in Guangxi. Thus, Zhang Fu took over the command of the Ming army stationed there. The military expedition would now be commanded by Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng. In the winter of 1406, the Ming armies began their invasion.. Zhang Fu departed from Guangxi and Mu Sheng departed from Yunnan for a pincer attack into enemy territory. Modern historians estimate that 135,000 troops set off from Guangxi and 80,000 troops set off from Yunnan. On 19 November 1406, they captured the two capitals and other important cities in the Red River Delta. On 24 November 1406, Zhang Fu's forces had conquered C·∫ßn Tram and several other strongholds. Mu Sheng's forces‚Äîwho had departed from Yunnan‚Äîmet up and joined Zhang Fu's forces at ƒêa Bang castle (northwest to Hanoi). On the afternoon of 12 December 1406, aided with heavy artillery bombardments, the Ming army launched 3-pronged attacks on the castle. Vietnamese military general Nguy·ªÖn T√¥ng ƒê·ªó opened the castle's gate for elephants charge, but the elephants were repelled and turned back the castle followed by the swarming Ming troops. ƒêa Bang defenders were been overran.http://epress.nus.edu.sg/msl/reign/yong-le/year-4-month-12-day-18 Geoff Wade, translator, Southeast Asia in the Ming Shi-lu: an open access resource, Singapore: Asia Research Institute and the Singapore E-Press, National University of Singapore In the next day, follow the fall of ƒêa Bang, with the help of defector M·∫°c Th√∫y, Zhang Fu's forces easily captured the city of ƒê√¥ng ƒê√¥ (modern-day Hanoi) and committed many violent atrocities against the city's civilians, also refueled their supplies. By the end of 1406, ƒêa Bang and ƒê√¥ng ƒê√¥ were captured by the Ming. In 13 March 1407, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly and his eldest son H·ªì Nguy√™n Tr·ª´ng led 35,000 troops with 615 artillery pieces, launched an naval counterattack to repel the Ming army from ƒê√¥ng ƒê√¥ in H√†m T·ª≠ river, but their forces were been surrounded and defeated by the Ming and forced to retreat to capital T√¢y ƒê√¥ (modern-day Thanh H√≥a). More than 10,000 Vietnamese soldiers were killed after this failed offensive.https://www.bbc.com/vietnamese/vietnam-48581607 Prominent families from the Red River plain, led by M·∫°c Th√∫y and his brothers (descendants of M·∫°c ƒêƒ©nh Chi), pledged their allegiance to the Ming.. By late January 1407, the Ming armies had taken control of the Red River Delta by superior siege and naval warfare. citadel of the H·ªì dynasty By early May 1407, H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly was forced to flee southwards as he had lost the support from his people and was being pursued by the Ming forces. The Ming armies expelled him from Thanh Hoa. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly destroyed his palace at T√¢y ƒê√¥ and fled to the south by ship. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly and his son H·ªì H√°n Th∆∞∆°ng were captured by the Ming on 16 June 1407. The rest of the monarchs were captured on either the same or following day. Their capture occurred in the region of the present-day H√† Tƒ©nh Province. They were caged and brought as prisoners to the Yongle Emperor in Nanjing. The Ming Shilu (Chinese: ÊòéÂØ¶ÈåÑ) 2 December 1407 entry stated that the Yongle Emperor gave orders to Marquis Zhang Fu to not harm innocent Vietnamese and to spare the family members of rebels, such as young males if they themselves were not involved in the rebellion.Wade, Geoff (translator).

The Yongle Emperor asked them whether they had killed the former king and had usurped the throne of the Tr·∫ßn royal family, but he received no answer in return. Most of the prisoners were either imprisoned or executed. H·ªì Qu√Ω Ly and his son H·ªì H√°n Th∆∞∆°ng were imprisoned, but there is no known record of their eventual fates thereafter. The oldest son H·ªì Nguy√™n Tr·ª´ng became weapon engineer near the Chinese capital Beijing. In 1442, he wrote a memoir titled Nam √îng m·ªông l·ª•c (Chinese: ÂçóÁøÅÂ§¢ÈåÑ) about his homeland. In June 1407, the Yongle Emperor annexed the conquered region as Jiaozhi (Giao Ch·ªâ) province.. L√º Yi (ÂëÇÊØÖ) was appointed as the military commissioner, Huang Zhong (ÈªÉ‰∏≠) as the vice-commissioner, and Huang Fu (ÈªÉÁ¶è) as the provincial administrator and the surveillance commissioner. Jiaozhi province was divided into fifteen prefectures, 41 sub-prefectures, and 210 counties. The first major signs of discontent against Chinese rule would surface when Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªói (a former Tr·∫ßn official) revolted in September 1408, but he was captured by Zhang Fu in December 1408. Tr·∫ßn Qu√Ω Kho√°ng (a nephew of Tr·∫ßn Ng·ªói) would continue the rebellion until he was captured by Zhang Fu on 30 March 1414, formally ending the rebellion.. Uprisings continued throughout the course of the Chinese domination. In addition to the annexation of ƒê·∫°i Ngu into Ming territory, the Yongle emperor sought to sinicize the people of Annam by ordering for all books about Annamese history and folk culture to be burned while keeping those of Chinese culture, such as Mahayana Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian texts.

Upon stimulation, granulocytes and monocytes produce reactive oxygen metabolites (superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorous acid) which destroy bacteria inside the phagosome. Formation of the reactive oxidants during the oxidative burst can be monitored by the addition and enzymatic oxidation of a fluorogenic substrate, DHR 123. The level of reactive oxygen radicals is determined by flow cytometry.Donadebian, H.D. 1989. Congenital and acquired neutrophil abnormalities.In: Klempner, M.S. et al. (eds) Phagocytes and Disease.

History The McCrudden light machine rifle was invented by ex-Australian serviceman John Charles Raginald McCrudden (known as Reg) following his discharge from the AIF in 1917. It is believed there are only two surviving examples of this interesting weapon, one being held in the Pattern Room in Leeds, England. The other McCrudden Light Machine Rifle Mk1 is on extended loan to the Power House Museum exhibition in Sydney, Australia.http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=11405&search;=gun&images;=&c;=1&s;=http://trove.nla.gov.au/result?q=mccrudden McCrudden's first hand-built prototype was believed to have been manufactured at an engineering workshop in Randwick, Sydney. McCrudden and his guns traveled from Sydney to Jervis Bay for an audience with Commodore J S Dumaresq and Lt Cmdr Burgh. He was received favorably and recommendations were made that he should take the gun to England for assessment by the British War Office, Dumaresq forwarding a favorable report in light of the Navy's pending trials to select a weapon to replace the Lewis Gun. Following Dumaresq's advice McCrudden took his designs to England where he had additional weapons made by Kingsway Manufacturing Company Ltd in London. Overview According to a press report in the Daily Telegraph of August 6, 1921 McCrudden alleged that his gun was foolproof, with only seven moving parts and had the advantage of having a variable rate of fire adjustable to ‚Äòfire one or 800 rounds per minute as easily as one can operate a throttle‚Äô. In addition the gun could also be easily converted to water cooling for sustained fire. Both the Mk and the later Miki suffered chronic misfeeds due to the internal design of the gun and the location of the magazine at the side of the gun. Had McCrudden relocated the magazine to the top, he may well have had a successful design.

Created in 1955, soon after his first flag painting, entitled simply Flag, it was the first painting by Johns to be acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, bought from the artist in 1998. The price was undisclosed but experts estimated its value at the time as more than $20 million. The painting is a relatively early example of the many works created by Johns from 1954, inspired by a dream of the U.S. flag. Painted on canvas using encaustic, oil, newsprint, and charcoal, White Flag is the first monochrome rendering of the US flag by Johns. Measuring by , it is also the largest of his flag paintings. Johns worked on three separately stretched areas of canvas - the 48 stars to the upper left, seven of the thirteen stripes to the upper right, and the remaining six longer stripes below - which were then combined to form a whole. The U.S. flag is depicted in the form it took between 1912 and 1959, with 48 white stars on a blue canton representing the then U.S. states (prior to the admission of Alaska and Hawaii) with thirteen red and white stripes. The stars and stripes are built up as a collage of paper and fabric which were dipped in molten beeswax before being applied to a ground of beeswax. The three collages were then joined together and covered with layer of fast-setting dirty white encaustic (beeswax mixed with white pigment) with highlights added in white oil paint. Johns's rapid brushstrokes are clearly visible in the roughly- finished encaustic medium. The completed work covers the whole of the canvas, with no frame, Johns's selection of the US flag allows him to explore a familiar two-dimensional object, with its simple internal geometric structure and a complex symbolic meaning. The built-up collage distorts the flags flatness, while the off-white encaustic obliterates the flag's usual red- white-and-blue colouring, leaving a ghostly embalmed remnant. Johns's Neo-Dada work anticipates aspects of pop art, minimal art, and conceptual art. Its 1988 Christie's auction for was briefly the highest auction price for an artwork by a living artist, as the record was supplanted the next day by another Johns painting.

From the outset the station (which had been built on a 1 in 66 gradient) was provided with a wooden fronted platform and a GWR Pagoda type hut. This platform was situated on the up (eastern) side of the line, adjacent to the public highway and was rebuilt from its original height of 1 foot 2 inches to the standard height of 3 feet during November 1908 (similar alterations were also made to other platforms on the line). The platform, as well as being accessible from the public highway, could also be accessed from the former Bullo Pill Tramway (locally known as the Dram Road) which was latterly used as a footpath, but there is no record of a boarded crossing over the track ever being provided at that location. In the later years, crews working down trains (uphill towards Bilson) claimed to have run short on steam and regularly abandoned their trains on the unofficial foot crossing; conveniently located next to the White Horse Public House.

It has been played annually since 1927, making it the longest uninterrupted intersectional rivalry in college football, and the third-longest never- interrupted college football rivalry overall, after only Minnesota vs. Wisconsin (uninterrupted since 1907) and Kansas State vs. Iowa State (uninterrupted since 1917). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 game has been canceled, even though both schools still plan to play a fall season schedule in 2020. Notre Dame leads the series 77‚Äì13‚Äì1. Before Navy won a 46‚Äì44 triple-overtime contest in 2007, Notre Dame had a 43-game winning streak that was the longest series win streak between two annual opponents in the history of Division I FBS football. Navy's previous win came in 1963, 35‚Äì14 with future Heisman Trophy winner and NFL QB Roger Staubach at the helm. Navy had come close to winning on numerous occasions before 2007. The Midshipmen subsequently won again in 2009, 2010 and 2016. Though the game is often played at Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, it has never been played at Navy‚ÄìMarine Corps Memorial Stadium, due to its relatively small size. Instead, Navy usually hosts the game at larger facilities such as Baltimore's old Memorial Stadium or current M&T; Bank Stadium, FedExField in Landover, Maryland, or at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. From 1960 to 1970, the Midshipmen hosted the game at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, and they hosted the 1972, 1974 and 1993 games at Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium. The game has been played twice in Dublin, Ireland‚Äîin 1996 at Croke Park and 2012 at Aviva Stadium. The game was also occasionally played at old Cleveland Stadium. The 2016 game was held at EverBank Field in Jacksonville, Florida. Navy's 2018 home game was played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California (the first time the teams have played each other west of the Eastern Time Zone). The 2020 game was to be at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, but due to the COVID 19 pandemic, it was first moved to Annapolis before finally being canceled altogether. This would have been the first time the game was played at Navy's home stadium. History Despite the one-sided result the last few decades, most Notre Dame and Navy fans consider the series a sacred tradition for historical reasons. Both schools have strong football traditions going back to the beginnings of the sport. Notre Dame, like many colleges, faced severe financial difficulties during World War II, which were exacerbated by the fact that it was then still an all-male institution. The US Navy made Notre Dame a training center for V-12 candidates and paid enough for usage of the facilities to keep the University afloat. Notre Dame has since extended an open invitation for Navy to play the Fighting Irish in football and considers the game annual repayment on a debt of honor. The series is marked by mutual respect, as evidenced by each team standing at attention during the playing of the other's alma mater after the game, a tradition that started in 2005. Navy's athletic director, on renewing the series through 2016, remarked \\"...it is of great interest to our collective national audience of Fighting Irish fans, Naval Academy alumni, and the Navy family at large.\\" The series is scheduled to continue indefinitely; renewals are a mere formality. However, the 2020 game ended up being canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting disruption to college football schedules. Notre Dame opted to play an Atlantic Coast Conference schedule for that one season only. The ACC allowed each team to play one non-conference game, which had to be in the school's home state. Western Michigan originally agreed to make the short trip from Kalamazoo to South Bend on September 19, but the Broncos subsequently canceled their entire fall season. Notre Dame subsequently scheduled a home game on that date against South Florida of the American Athletic Conference instead. Notre Dame won that game 52-0. The Midshipmen opted to play independent BYU instead of Notre Dame, in Annapolis. On Monday, September 7, 2020, BYU routed Navy, 57-3, behind closed doors. On August 6, 2020, Navy and Notre Dame signed an agreement continuing their rivalry series for the next 12 seasons, from 2021 through 2032. The Streak Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak against Navy began in 1964: * 1964 ‚Äì Notre Dame 40, Navy 0: Notre Dame came in at 5‚Äì0 under first year coach Ara Parseghian and shut out the Midshipmen in a game that pitted 1963 Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach against 1964 winner John Huarte. * 1969 ‚Äì Notre Dame 47, Navy 0: The Irish set a still-standing, single-game school record of 720 total offensive yards. * 1974 ‚Äì Notre Dame 14, Navy 6: For three quarters, Navy kept the Fighting Irish offense in check with its punting game and led 6‚Äì0 going into the fourth quarter. Notre Dame quarterback Tom Clements threw a touchdown pass to Pete Demmerle to put the Fighting Irish in front, then Randy Harrison added an insurance touchdown with an interception return. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, Irish coach Ara Parseghian privately decided to resign at the end of the season after this game. * 1976 ‚Äì Notre Dame 27, Navy 21: Irish defensive back Dave Waymer tipped away a fourth down pass in the end zone late in the game to preserve the win for Notre Dame. * 1984 ‚Äì Notre Dame 18, Navy 17: John Carney's field goal with 14 seconds left erased a 17‚Äì7 deficit. The officials failed to notice that the play clock had expired before the ball was snapped. * 1991 ‚Äì Notre Dame 38, Navy 0: Notre Dame's 700th victory. * 1997 ‚Äì Notre Dame 21, Navy 17: Allen Rossum saved the day for the Fighting Irish, knocking Navy receiver Pat McGrew out of bounds at the 1-yard line on a 69-yard pass as time ran out. * 1999 ‚Äì Notre Dame 28, Navy 24: Notre Dame needed a 1st down on 4th and 9 with 1:37 left. They failed to convert but an errant spot allowed the Irish to keep possession and eventually score to escape with a 28‚Äì24 win. * 2002 ‚Äì Notre Dame 30, Navy 23: Notre Dame, coming off a 14‚Äì7 upset loss to Boston College, scored 15 unanswered points late in the fourth quarter to win under first-year head coach Tyrone Willingham. * 2003 ‚Äì Notre Dame 27, Navy 24: D.

Rio Nutria joins Rio Pescado to form the Zuni River in McKinley County on the Zuni Indian Reservation, in western New Mexico. History Rio Nutria is archaic sixteenth and seventeenth century Spanish (primarily rural Castilian) for \\"beaver river\\". In New Mexico there are at least two other Rio Nutrias rivers. One is the Rio Nutrias which is tributary to the Rio Chama, described by Francisco Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante who wrote in his diary on August 2, 1776, \\"...we halted in a small plain on the bank of another arroyo which is called Rio de las Nutrias, because, although it is of permanent and running water, apparently during all or most of the year it stands in pools where they say beavers breed.\\" In his annotated 1900 translation of the diary of Francisco Garc√©s, Elliott Coues wrote in a footnote: \\"In proof of this use of nutrias for beavers I can cite a passage in Escalante's Diario. Doc. para Hist. Mex.,2d ser., i, 1854, p. 426: \\"Aqui tienen las nutrias hechos con palizades tales tanques, que representan a primera vista un rio mas que mediano - here have the beavers made with sticks such ponds that they look at first sight like a river larger than usual\\"; the reference being of course to the damming of the stream by these animals.\\" In his dictionary of New Mexico and Southern Colorado Spanish, Rub√©n Cobos also translates the word nutria (which is contemporary Spanish for otter), as meaning beaver in the archaic Spanish that persists in the region from the earliest settlers since 1598. Watershed and course The Rio Nutria passes into the Zuni Indian Reservation and enters one of several reservoirs on the river, the Nutria Diversion Reservoir, then passes through the villages of Upper Nutria (native name is Tsediijih) and Lower Nutria (native name is Taiakwin). Rio Nutria then passes into Nutria Reservoir N. 3, 4 and 2 before reaching its confluence with the Rio Pescado. Ecology Not surprisingly, the river is excellent habitat for beavers (Castor canadensis). Fish species found in the Rio Nutrias at the U.S. 285 crossing include Rio Grande chub (Gila pandora), Fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), Flathead chub (Platygobio gracilis), Longnose dace (Rhinichthys cataractae), and White Sucker (Catostomus commersoni).

Hypothalamic disorders result from a deficiency in the release of gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH), while pituitary gland disorders are due to a deficiency in the release of gonadotropins from the anterior pituitary. GnRH is the central regulator in reproductive function and sexual development via the HPG axis. GnRH is released by hypothalamic neuroendocrine cells into the hypophyseal portal system acting on gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary. The release of gonadotropins, LH and FSH, act on the gonads for the development and maintenance of proper adult reproductive physiology. LH acts on Leydig cells in the male testes and theca cells in the female. FSH acts on Sertoli cells in the male and follicular cells in the female. Combined this causes the secretion of gonadal sex steroids and the initiation of folliculogenesis and spermatogenesis. The production of sex steroids forms a negative feedback loop acting on both the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus causing a pulsatile secretion of GnRH. GnRH neurons lack sex steroid receptors and mediators such as kisspeptin stimulate GnRH neurons for pulsatile secretion of GnRH. Types There are two subtypes of HH, congenital HH (CHH) and acquired HH (AHH). CHH is due to genetic abnormalities resulting in non-functional GnRH secreting neurons or gonadotropic cell dysfunction in the anterior pituitary. CHH is divided into 2 subtypes depending on the condition of the olfactory system, anosmic HH (Kallman syndrome) and normosmic HH. AHH is an acquired form of the disease often occurring after sexual maturation and is not related to genetic defects. Pathogenesis CHH is a type of HH resulting from the abnormal migration of GnRH neurons during embryonic development. GnRH neurons are derived from the olfactory placode and migrate into the central nervous system (CNS) during embryonic development. Embryonic migration can be affected by several gene mutations including but not limited to, KAL1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF8), sex determining region Y-Box 10 (SOX10), GNRHR, GNRH1 and KISS1R . Kallmann syndrome results in a loss of smell (anosmia) and is associated with KAL1 mutations. The KAL1 gene encodes anosmin-1, an extracellular adhesion molecule that plays a role in GnRH neuronal migration and adhesion. Mutated KAL1 genes leads to ill GnRH neuronal migration as well as olfactory neuron disorder causing anosmia and non-functional GnRH releasing neurons. Mutations of KAL1 are mostly nucleotide insertion or deletion causing frame shifts in the translation of anosmin-1 resulting in a faulty protein. Inactivating mutations in the genes encoding GNRH1 or its receptor will result in the failure of the HPG axis and give rise to normosmic CHH. Inactivating mutations of KISS1 or KISS1R causes normosmic CHH in humans This is because KISS1 is the mediator for the feedback loop in the HPG axis allowing low levels of sex steroid to stimulate GnRH secretion from the hypothalamus. CHH is a genetically heterogenous disorder with cases reported as being X-linked, recessive and autosomally inherited. The prevalence has been estimated to be 1/4000 to 1/10000 in males and 2 to 5 times less frequent in females. The prevalence difference between male and females is unknown, and is likely to be underreported for females. Acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (AHH) is a postnatal onset of a GnRH releasing disorder and/or pituitary gonadotroph cell disorder. There are many causes of AHH, mostly due to structural or functional abnormalities involving the HPG axis such as sarcoidosis, lymphocytic hypophysitis, pituitary adenomas, craniopharyngiomas and other CNS tumours. Most of these patients have multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. Hyperprolactinaemia is the most common cause of AHH. It is a well-established cause of infertility in both male and female mammals. Prolactin inhibits GnRH neurons and therefore inhibits the subsequent release of LH, FSH and sex steroids. The mechanism of prolactin induced inhibition of GnRH release is poorly understood. It is suspected that the prolactin receptor is expressed on a small subset of GnRH neurons in mice and thus has a direct inhibitory effect on GnRH release. There is evidence to suggest indirect inhibition of GnRH neurons mediated by other neurotransmitters such as dopamine, opioid, neuropeptide Y and Œ≥-aminobutyric acid. Drug usage of glucocorticoids and opioid analgesics in high dosages can lead to the inhibition of GnRH synthesis. Opioid receptors reside in the hypothalamus and when bound to opioids they decrease the normal pulsatile secretion of GnRH and therefore result in HH. Chronic treatment with supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids results in a marked decrease in testosterone without an increase of LH levels, suggestive of a central mechanism of induced HH. Diagnosis The clinical presentation of HH depend on the time of onset as well as the severity of the defect. Diagnostic tests to measure GnRH levels are difficult. This is because GnRH is confined within hypophyseal portal system and has a short half-life of 2‚Äì4 minutes. GnRH levels are thus checked indirectly via LH and FSH levels which will be totally or partially absent in HH. Exogenous GnRH can be used as a diagnostic tool. If the patient has hypothalamic GnRH deficiency, LH and FSH will gradually appear in response to the exogenous GnRH but in pituitary cases of HH, a minimal response will be generated. Typically, CHH is diagnosed in adolescence due to a lack of pubertal development, but it can be possible to diagnose in male neonates. Clinical presentations of CHH involve an absence of puberty by 18 years of age, poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics, or infertility. In men with CHH, serum levels of inhibin B are typically very low as inhibin B is a marker of Sertoli cell number. For females, CHH is most commonly revealed by primary amenorrhea. Breast development is variable and pubic hair may or may not be present. CHH can be diagnosed in the male neonate with cryptorchidism (maldescended testes) and a micropenis as signs of GnRH deficiency. There are no clear signs of CHH in female neonates. Another clinical sign of CHH, more specifically Kallmann syndrome, is a lack of a sense of smell due to the altered migration of GnRH neurons on the olfactory placode. Kallmann syndrome can also be shown through MRI imaging with irregular morphology or aplasia of the olfactory bulb and olfactory sulci. Anterior pituitary function must be normal for all other axes in CHH as it is an isolated disorder. Testing anterior pituitary function is helpful to identify if the HH is due to hyperprolactinemia. Management The goal for HH therapy is to induce pubertal development, sexual function, fertility, bone health, and psychological wellbeing Testosterone therapy for males and estradiol therapy for females is used to improve genital development, develop secondary sexual characteristics, allow for the growth and closure of the epiphyseal plate, as well as improving sexual function. This therapy does not restore fertility as gonadotropins are required for spermatogenesis and folliculogenesis. If fertility is desired, pulsatile GnRH therapy or gonadotropin therapy is necessary. Gonadotropin therapy involves the use of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and FSH. In the male, hCG stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone so that plasma and testicular levels increase. With the increased levels of testosterone, sexual activity, libido and overall wellbeing should improve. Administration of FSH is required to induce spermatogenesis by acting on Sertoli cells. FSH is required for maintaining the production of high numbers of good quality sperm. Gonadotropin therapy in HH men usually is able to generate enough sperm for fertility to occur, however sperm count is still lower than normal. In the female, the goal for gonadotropin therapy is to obtain ovulation. This is obtained with FSH treatment followed by hCG or LH to trigger ovulation. FSH will stimulate granulosa cells for follicular maturation while LH will act on luteal cells to produce steroids aiding follicular maturation and preparing the endometrium for pregnancy. For hyperprolactinaemia-caused AHH, dopamine agonists are used to improve GnRH secretion. Dopamine binds to D2 receptors on lactotrophs within the anterior pituitary This results in the inhibition of secretion of prolactin resulting in less direct and indirect inhibition of GnRH secretion. In up to 10-20% of cases, patients can exhibit sustained fertility and steroid production after therapy, resulting in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism reversal. The mechanism for this reversal is unknown but there is believed to be some neuronal plasticity within GnRH releasing cells.

The society locates sites of American and Jewish historical interest and importance. It works with local community organizations, synagogues, churches, historical societies, governments and individuals, to erect interpretive historical markers that help illuminate the American-Jewish experience and reflect on the commonality of being American. JASHP was founded in 1999 after the discovery by the founder, Jerry Klinger, of the first permanent Jewish house of worship in the territory of New Mexico (Temple Montefiore, Las Vegas, N.M.). JASHP has completed projects in 37 states and in five countries. Projects are constantly being developed and proposals are welcomed. Over 7,000,000 people a year benefit from JASHP projects. The society is a small organization. Each program is individualized with organizational participation from as few as two or three people to as many as 300. Considering JASHP's size, its impact has been disproportionately large.

This construction arises naturally in an attempt to find a replacement for the circumcenter of a quadrilateral in the case that is non-cyclic. Definition of the construction Suppose that the vertices of the quadrilateral Q are given by Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4 . Let b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4 be the perpendicular bisectors of sides Q_1Q_2,Q_2Q_3,Q_3Q_4,Q_4Q_1 respectively. Then their intersections Q_i^{(2)}=b_{i+2}b_{i+3} , with subscripts considered modulo 4, form the consequent quadrilateral Q^{(2)} . The construction is then iterated on Q^{(2)} to produce Q^{(3)} and so on. First iteration of the perpendicular bisector construction An equivalent construction can be obtained by letting the vertices of Q^{(i+1)} be the circumcenters of the 4 triangles formed by selecting combinations of 3 vertices of Q^{(i)} . Properties 1\\\\. If Q^{(1)} is not cyclic, then Q^{(2)} is not degenerate.J. King, Quadrilaterals formed by perpendicular bisectors, in Geometry Turned On, (ed. J. King), MAA Notes 41, 1997, pp. 29‚Äì32. 2\\\\. Quadrilateral Q^{(2)} is never cyclic. Combining #1 and #2, Q^{(3)} is always nondegenrate. 3\\\\. Quadrilaterals Q^{(1)} and Q^{(3)} are homothetic, and in particular, similar.G. C. Shephard, The perpendicular bisector construction, Geom. Dedicata, 56 (1995) 75‚Äì84. Quadrilaterals Q^{(2)} and Q^{(4)} are also homothetic. 3\\\\. The perpendicular bisector construction can be reversed via isogonal conjugation.O. Radko and E. Tsukerman, The Perpendicular Bisector Construction, the Isoptic Point and the Simson Line of a Quadrilateral, Forum Geometricorum 12: 161‚Äì189 (2012). That is, given Q^{(i+1)} , it is possible to construct Q^{(i)} . 4\\\\. Let \\\\alpha, \\\\beta, \\\\gamma, \\\\delta be the angles of Q^{(1)} . For every i , the ratio of areas of Q^{(i)} and Q^{(i+1)} is given by : (1/4)(\\\\cot(\\\\alpha)+\\\\cot(\\\\gamma))(\\\\cot(\\\\beta)+\\\\cot(\\\\delta)). 5\\\\. If Q^{(1)} is convex then the sequence of quadrilaterals Q^{(1)}, Q^{(2)},\\\\ldots converges to the isoptic point of Q^{(1)} , which is also the isoptic point for every Q^{(i)} . Similarly, if Q^{(1)} is concave, then the sequence Q^{(1)}, Q^{(0)}, Q^{(-1)},\\\\ldots obtained by reversing the construction converges to the Isoptic Point of the Q^{(i)} 's. References * J.

Political Persecution He moved to the United States in September 2013, after he became the target of some government authorities involved in the trafficking of drugs and money laundering to the United States. After this Mr. El Aissami falsely accused Mr. Isea of corruption and personally conducted an investigation and presented fabricated evidence. The Attorney General at the time, Luisa Ortega, allowed Mr. El Aissami as governor to manage a team of prosecutors for this case, which is illegal. Without a guarantee of an impartial, fair, and legal trial, Mr. Isea decided to remain in the US, until the government changes and have the opportunity to demonstrate his innocence. His family has also been targeted by the Venezuelan government, when on June 2015, SEBIN agents detained Rosario Romero and Raiza Isea, mother and sister of Rafael Isea, as measured retaliation ordered by Tareck El Aissami, governor of Aragua state at that time, trying to force Rafael Isea to return to Venezuela to surrender to the Chavista justice.

Written by Betty Burbridge and Stanley Roberts, based on a story by Luci Ward and Jack Natteford, the film is about a singing cowboy and his buddies who discover that the ranch they bought is really a dairy farm‚Äîand worse, it's subject to intimidation from a protection racket that prevents dairy products from safely reaching the market.Magers, pp. 138‚Äì139. Plot Tired of traveling around the country performing their music, singing cowboy Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his Texas Troubadors decide to purchase a cattle ranch and settle down. When they arrive at the ranch purchased for them by Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette), they cannot believe that the herd consists of milkcows rather than the cattle they had anticipated. Soon they find themselves in the middle of a dairy war in which various farmers' trucks are being hijacked and destroyed in an attempt to drive them out of business. The town veterinarian, Dr. Rodney Blair (Robert Barrat), suggests that the Hall Trucking Company is behind the raids and proposes the establishment of a protective association. No one suspects that Blair and deputy sheriff Dave Haines (Buster Crabbe) are in fact the real masterminds behind the sabotage. When Gene vetoes Blair's idea of a protective association, the doctor directs his men to attack Gene's ranch, sending a secret code over the radio station owned by Haines's unsuspecting sister Carol (June Storey). During the raid, Gene captures Clanton (Jack Ingram), one of Blair's men, and turns him over to Sheriff George Glenn (William Farnum). Soon after, Blair arrives at the jail, kills the sheriff, and frees his henchman. Suspecting that Blair and Haines are involved in the raids, Gene accepts decides to run for sheriff against Haines, and he wins. Gene then convinces the ranchers to contract with the Hall Trucking Company. When he discovers Blair's secret radio messages, he tricks Dr. Blair and his men into an ambush in which the milk trucks are overturned, and the hijackers are caught. Gene and his men emerge victorious in the dairy war.

He was known particularly for his books on the grand hotels of New York City and London. Early life Morehouse was born in New York City on August 11, 1945, the son of newspaperman/drama critic Ward Morehouse II and actress-turned-publisher Joan Marlowe. He grew up in New York City hotels and relocated to Darien, Connecticut, when his mother remarried. He graduated from Darien High School in 1963 and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years before joining the acting company of the American Shakespeare Festival in 1966. Morehouse held various jobs from 1966 to 1969 while writing plays and attending Columbia University School of General Studies at night. In 1969, he joined the New York Post as a copy boy, briefly becoming a police reporter in 1972. 1970s and 1980s Morehouse was a staff correspondent at the Christian Science Monitor from 1973 through 1983. From 1973 to 1976, he covered business and consumer issues in Boston. He also wrote a lengthy series on New England railroads, rural poverty and business. After transferring to The Monitor‚Äôs New York City bureau, Morehouse covered politics, stories of New York life, and increasingly, entertainment-based pieces about Broadway from 1977 to 1983. After 1983, he continued to freelance for The Monitor and write for additional publications including Theatre Magazine, The Baltimore Sun and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Morehouse's play, The Actors, was first produced Off-Off Broadway at the Troupe Theatre in November 1982. In 1986, The Actors was produced at the Royal Court Theatre on Manhattan‚Äôs West Side and ran until May 1987. He produced his next play My Four Mothers at the Jan Hus Theatre with a $10,000 grant from the Lambs Foundation of the Lambs Club. Over the next few years, Morehouse had two other plays produced Off-Off Broadway. 1990s In 1991, M Evans & Company published Morehouse's first book The Waldorf-Astoria: America's Gilded Dream. In 1993, Morehouse began freelancing on a regular basis for the Reuters, covering The Business of Broadway and writing occasional reviews of Broadway shows for Reuters as well as Reuters TV. In 1994, he returned to the New York Post adding a weekly \\"On & Off Broadway‚Äù column to his reporting, until 1998. Morehouse was the first to report in July 1994 that Disney's The Lion King was headed for Broadway, which Disney vigorously denied. Morehouse left The Post in 1998, but continued to freelance celebrity news stories for them until 2000. 2000 to present Morehouse ended his freelancing with The New York Post in 2000, his last interview with Katharine Hepburn. In 2002, he joined the [regenerated] New York Sun as the Broadway After Dark columnist, reviving the popular column initiated by his father for the original New York Sun. He held that post until late 2004 when he joined amNew York. Morehouse worked for amNew York for two years, after which he brought the column to The Epoch Times. In 2001, If It Was Easy, a play Morehouse co-wrote with Stewart F. Lane, a Broadway producer and theater owner, was produced Off-Broadway at the Douglas Fairbanks Theatre. It ran for four months. Also that year, his second book, Inside the Plaza: An Intimate Portrait of the Ultimate Hotel was published by Applause Theatre and Cinema Books, an imprint of the Hal Leonard Corporation. In 2006, Morehouse wrote Life at the Top: Inside New York's Grand Hotels, one of three books to be published with BearManor Media. This was followed by Discovering the Hudson, a history of the historic Hudson Theatre in 2007. In 2010 Morehouse wrote London's Grand Hotels, a history of nearly 30 London grand hotels, including The Savoy, The Dorchester, and Brown's. It was also published by BearManor Media. This book made Morehouse one of the top hotel authors in America. In 2010, Morehouse co-wrote the play Gangplank with Mark Druck, which was produced by the American Theatre of Actors on West 54th Street as an Off-Off Broadway production. Present Morehouse wrote a monthly Checking In column for TravelSmart Newsletter about hotels from San Francisco to New England and a number in London, Brussels and Paris. In April 2012 Applause Theatre and Cinema Books published a revised and updated version of his book \\"Inside the Plaza\\". He was also a drama critic for Black Tie Magazine.

Works=American Civil War John A Wilson in studio creating Washington Grays Monument, Boston The year after Wilson graduated from School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1905), he received his first major recognition when he was commissioned by the State of Pennsylvania to make the Washington Grays Monument in Philadelphia to the men who served in the American Civil War.George MacLaren. \\"Nova Scotia's First Sculpture: John A. Wilson\\", Nova Scotia Historical Quarterly, Vol. #3:2 (1973), p. 118. In 1909, Wilson's soldier's monument for all soldiers of war was unveiled on Dudley's Town Common (in front of the First Congregational Church), Dudley, Massachusetts. A crowd of 1200 was in attendance.Worcester Daily Telegram July 6, 1909 Four- sided and capped with the sculpture of an American eagle, the multiwar memorial has inscriptions for the American Revolution: \\"To the memory of Dudley's Heroes who bore arms to found an Independent Nation - 1776\\"; the American Civil War: \\"Her Patriots of 1861-1865 who offered their lives to Preserve this Union\\"; and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War/Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War: \\"her soldiers in the Spanish-Philippines War, 1878.\\" In 1909, Wilson created the \\"Massachusetts Monument\\" in the Baton Rouge National Cemetery. The commemorative monument on its grounds, was erected to honor Massachusetts sailors and soldiers who died in Civil War battles in the Gulf region. The granite monument is inscribed with the names of the Infantries and Light Batteries that served in the Gulf theater of operations. Massachusetts Governor Ebenezer Sumner Draper attended the proceedings. In 1911, he created a statue of Private Daniel A. Bean of Brownfield, Maine, 11th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. Major Sylvanus Bangs BeanSylvanus Bean served with the 11th Maine Regiment along with his son, Daniel A. Bean. Daniel was killed in Hampton, Virginia as a result of being shot in both thighs during the war. Daniel died before his father Sylvanus could see him at the field hospital. Daniel died on 06/06/1864 and is buried at Plot: D 2820, Hampton National Cemetery, City of Hampton, Virginia, USA. The statue of Daniel Bean stands in Brownfield, Maine, where the roads to Hiram and Denmark diverge. Of all the Civil War memorials erected by Maine towns, this remarkable monument was the only one cast in the image of a real person. The absence of weapons distinguishes it even further. The boy stands as he would have on his last day at home, taking the Oath of Induction.MacDonald, p. 60; One writer suggested the figure is holding his cap in one hand and waving a timid goodbye with the other.

It was the first major work Wilson created in his new \\"Waban Studio\\". Although this statue, unlike that of Bean, is armed, it has been described as \\"silent\\" because the soldier has no cartridge box on his belt so he cannot fire his gun..Silent Sam (Civil War Monument), The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Virtual Tour; retrieved March 1, 2008.

Christian, 2007. p. 109 Each year on the second Sunday in June, memorial services sponsored by the Charitable Association of the Boston Fire Department are held at the Firemen's Memorial at Forest Hills Cemetery in order to pay tribute to deceased members so they would be assured of a decent and final resting place and they would not necessarily end up in Pauper's Field. On a lofty granite base a larger-than-life fireman in bronze, attired for service but in a moment of contemplation. On each side of the pedestal were set bronze plaques, 3 ft. by 4 ft., depicting the life of a fireman in the spirit of a renowned set of Currier & Ives prints. Shown in vivid bas-relief were horse- powered equipment and men en route to their duty. The plaque on the rear of the statue pictures a nineteenth century pumper as it would have looked between fires in the firehouse with no horses, men, or background. The memorial was dedicated in grand style on June 14, 1909. On that day, set aside in all the state for past firemen, the memorial was dedicated in a ceremony partially presided over by John F.

If it had not been for that, classes at the Copley Society of Art and Sundays in your studio, I fear my life long dream of being a sculptor would not have materialized. Where anybody today could get the sound training you gave us, I have no idea.MacDonald, p. 83  Nova Scotia  The Nova Scotia monuments were made in the same year (1923). The Hector Pioneer was made in the Worcester Art Museum. Wilson's assistant for the work was Evangeline (Eells) Wheeler. The sculpture was unveiled 17 July 1923 on the 150 Anniversary of the arrival of the ship Hector. The Governor General of Canada Field Marshal Julian Byng, 1st Viscount Byng of Vimy led the proceedings. = The Lion Series = Carmichael-Stewart House Museum, New Glasgow, Nova Scotia Wilson made a series of nine lions in freestone early in his career.

The episode is billed as the first of a two-part season finale. It is co-written by Wendy Riss and Aaron Zelman and directed by Keith Gordon. In the episode, the detectives look to Richmond's campaign staff for suspects, while he gets ready for the election; and Mitch and Stan Larsen try to get their family back to normal. Plot Picking up where the previous episode left off, Linden (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) peg Gwen and Jamie as prime suspects‚Äîthe only ones in Richmond's campaign with enough power to broker a deal between the Indians and Michael Ames. The detectives enter Mayor Adams' office and strike a deal: he (Tom Butler) will keep Lt. Carlson off their backs and they will not expose Adams' involvement in the doctored toll booth photo of Richmond. Linden insists they are fighting a common enemy, noting that Richmond's camp planted the Indian bones at Adams' waterfront construction site. At the Larsen home, Terry (Jamie Anne Allman) and the boys return from trick-or-treating. Denny (Seth Isaac Johnson) embraces Mitch when he sees her, but Tommy (Evan Bird) walks away. Terry later surprises Mitch with the news that Stan bought a house and argues when Mitch defends her long absence. She tells Mitch that she has been trying to keep the family together while Mitch was on \\"some vision quest\\". Linden and Holder review Jamie and Gwen's alibis on the night of Rosie's murder. Holder says Jamie was with his grandfather all night, then went to the city hall gym at 4:37 a.m. ‚Äî without his keycard, according to a guard. The next morning, Holder calls Linden to report that Jamie's grandfather confirmed Jamie's alibi. At City Hall, Linden asks a Richmond campaign worker (Sachin Sahel) to identify the owner of the blood-stained keycard. He says the list of keycard IDs was mysteriously deleted from his hard drive soon after Rosie's murder, but adds that Gwen requested a new keycard after the murder. At the casino, Holder and Linden see Chief Jackson (Claudia Ferri) and Roberta Drays (Patti Kim) arguing and deduce that they are romantically involved. Jackson gives them security camera footage from the night of Rosie's murder ‚Äî minus footage from the elevator camera, which she claims is broken. Linden sees a photo from the casino's grand opening and points out Gwen (Kristin Lehman) and Senator Eaton (Alan Dale) standing alongside Chief Jackson. Councilwoman Ruth Yitanes (Lee Garlington) tells the detectives that Gwen canceled their dinner plans on the night of Rosie's murder. When asked if the Richmond campaign has links to a Michael Ames' company, Yitanes says the company donates to Mayor Adams. Richmond (Billy Campbell) emerges from the voting booth. The press takes pictures of him and Mayor Adams together. Adams quietly tells Richmond his career is over. Outside, Gwen and Richmond hold hands, she laments that she \\"tried so hard\\" for him. At the city-planning department, the detectives learn that Ames has several companies. His newest had its authorization to bid on city contracts expedited by Jamie and that Michael's wife Sally's name is not on the new company, which has landed the contract for the mayor's waterfront construction site. Linden and Holder question Jamie (Eric Ladin) about Ames' new company. He says he expedited the request in an attempt to woo Ames as a campaign donor. When asked about his keycard, he shows it to Holder. Linden later wonders if Gwen and Jamie are both involved in Rosie's murder. Holder speculates that Gwen canceled her dinner with Yitanes upon learning about the waterfront break-in. In the Larsen garage, Stan (Brent Sexton) smiles upon hearing about Janek's death on the radio. Mitch (Michelle Forbes) says she knows about the second house and Stan suggests they move for a \\"fresh start.\\" They argue about leaving the memories of Rosie behind and moving on with their lives. The detectives visit the yacht club, where a valet (Grayson Gabriel) shares the guest sign-in log for October 5. Gwen's name is signed in at 8:37 p.m. with a license plate number that matches the campaign car in which Rosie's body was found. They question Gwen, who admits she recently lost her keycard but maintains she was at a Tacoma bed and breakfast on the night of Rosie's murder. Linden asks her about the campaign car, but she warns them to be careful with murder accusations. Later at Holder's apartment, Linden studies the grand opening photo and notices Jackson's former head of security had a broken arm. At the casino, the detectives tell Drays that Jackson framed her former head of security for murder and will eventually do the same to her. They demand to see all withheld casino security footage from the night of Rosie's murder. Richmond's campaign team erupts in cheers when they learn Richmond and Adams are now close in the poll numbers. He receives a phone call, asking what the caller wants as he watches Gwen and Jamie talk. Richmond's driver drops him off at the house of Jamie's grandfather, Ted Wright (Marcel Maillard). Jamie later arrives and asks his grandfather what was so important that he needed to talk to him, then he sees Richmond, who asks Jamie why he lied to him. The detectives watch the missing security footage, which reveals the campaign car pulling up at 12:58 a.m. Holder plays a second disc, labeled \\"10th floor elevator.\\" They watch Rosie (Katie Findlay) enter the elevator at 1:02 a.m., Chief Jackson enters it at 1:04 a.m., and Michael Ames (Barclay Hope) enters it at 1:05. Finally, at 1:07, Jamie enters the elevator and looks directly into the camera. Reception=Critical reception \\"Donnie or Marie\\" received positive reviews. Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4.6 out of 5 stars and \\"could barely move\\" after watching the episode. \\"There's still a sense of not really having any clue who killed Rosie, which may be extremely obnoxious to some and perfectly riveting to others. But that noir tone has never changed, The characters have remained true to themselves flaws and all, and the case, while at times long winded, in these last few episodes has felt like it's moved somewhere, giving us something to grasp onto and feel as if the answers are within our reach.\\" The A.V. Club's Brandon Nowalk rated this episode a B, calling it a \\"suspenseful cliffhanger\\" and comparing the cross-editing to the previous episode \\"Bulldog\\" by stating: \\"The difference is that last week cut between an absorbing dramatic scene and an energetic detective scene while \\"Donny Or Marie\\" [sic] cuts between two thrilling mysteries surfing each other's wakes. Instead of falling through the dramatic pauses, the momentum carries all the way through the finale.\\" William Bibbiani of CraveOnline was pleased to see an episode dedicated to the murder investigation. He stated: \\"I've been saying throughout this season that The Killing would have to really step up its game in the last few episodes to make the last 11 episodes seem like they were worth the trouble, and while 'Donnie or Marie' is certainly a strong one, it's not so revelatory or dramatic that it forgives the failings of the season that precedes it. If every episode of the season was this good, The Killing would have been a much better series. But even then, it would need to really end with a glorified bang to justify the buildup.\\" Ratings The episode was watched by 1.84 million viewers, making it the most viewed episode of the season, and scored a 0.5 rating in the 18-49 demographic, even with the previous episode.

Eddy (June 15, 1907 ‚Äì April 13, 1998) was an American economist who served in the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury Department between 1934 and 1954. He was in Harry Dexter White's Division of Monetary Research. Between 1948 and 1954 he was Chief of Division for the Treasury's Gold and Silver Exchange Stabilization Fund. Career=Early years Eddy was born in New Jersey on June 15, 1907. From 1921 to 1924 he attended Phillips Academy in Andover, MA, and he received his BA from Yale University in 1928. (He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa there). He studied at Harvard University from 1930 to 1933, when he received an MBA. At Harvard, his interest lay macroeconomic policies, specifically U.S. deficit and prosperity via stable prices. Government service In December 1933, Eddy became assistant to the Economist and Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He worked as a research analyst for the Division of Research and Statistics at the U.S. Treasury (1934‚Äì1936). He returned to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1936, where he worked in its Research Department until 1939, first Far Eastern affairs, later on domestic finance and business issues. After a brief time as a columnist and reporter for the Journal of Commerce in New York City, he returned to the Treasury (still in 1939) as a senior economic analyst in the Division of Monetary Research. During World War II, Eddy served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. He remained in the Navy as a reservist. Upon his return from the war, he resumed work for the U.S. Treasury under (to be) accused communist Harry Dexter White, who was then director of the Division of Monetary Research. From 1948 to 1954 he was Chief of Division for the Treasury's Gold and Silver Exchange Stabilization Fund. In 1948, Eddy traveled to Saudi Arabia, possibly to help establish the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency. Accusation and clearance In 1954, Eddy was suspended from the U.S. Treasury as a security risk. At the time, many Treasury employees came under suspicion of communist sympathies. The suspension arose from his associations with and open support of alleged communists, including Lauchlin Currie, Harry Dexter White, V. Frank Coe, Robert C. Barnard, Emile Despres, William Ludwig Ullman, Harold Glasser, Solomon Adler, and William Henry Taylor. Elizabeth Bentley, a former communist who became a government informer, was a main source of information on the communist activities of Treasury employees. During Eddy's hearing, his lawyer (Byron N. Scott) attacked Bentley's credibility and evidence against many of those he defended. Eddy mentioned to the Security Board that he also doubted the guilt of Alger Hiss (convicted in 1950 of perjury). In late 1955, following his hearing, Eddy received full clearance and back pay. Retirement Soon after receiving full clearance, Eddy resigned from the U.S. Treasury. He began a book about the accusations of Bentley and Whittaker Chambers against Hiss and White. Personal life In 1941, Eddy married wife Eileen. He died on April 13, 1998. Writings In September 1998, Bruce Craig gave the Harvard University Law School materials accumulated by Eddy: research papers of Elinor Ferry (from Ferry's son James), files related to the William Henry Taylor case (from Bryan Scott), and Eddy's own papers (each processed and inventoried separately by Harvard). Eddy's papers formed a major source for Treasonable Doubt by R. Bruce Craig.

Levy, directed by Paul Landres, and starring John Beal and Colleen Gray. Like 1956's The Werewolf, it offered a science fiction take on a traditionally supernatural creature, although the films were produced by different production companies. The film was released theatrically in San Francisco as a double feature with The Monster That Challenged the World, but it did not receive a theatrical run aside from this. The Vampire, due to the use of its alternative title, is now often confused in references with the 1935 film Mark of the Vampire starring Bela Lugosi. Plot The late Dr. Campbell was experimenting with vampire bat blood just before his death. Colleague Paul Beecher (Beal) finds a bottle of pills among Dr. Campbell's effects and takes them home. Dr. Beecher's daughter, Betsy (Lydia Reed), accidentally substitutes the vampire blood pills for her father's migraine tablets. As a result, the kindly Dr. Beecher starts having blackouts from the pills. During a consultation with patient Marion Wilkins (Ann Staunton), Paul feels unwell and asks her to return the next day. The following morning, he receives a phone call notifying him that Marion has gotten progressively ill. When he goes to visit her, he finds her terrified by his presence, and she dies suddenly. On her neck, Paul finds two puncture wounds. Worried about his recent blackouts, Paul returns to Campbell's lab where he speaks with his colleague, Will Beaumont (Dabbs Greer). Will tells Paul that Dr. Campbell's research involved regressing animals‚Äô minds to a primitive state, then reversing and advancing the process. The next morning, Henry (James Griffith) is mysteriously found dead with the same puncture wounds and inexplicable disintegration of the tissue on his neck. Later, Paul is called to the hospital to perform an emergency surgery, but is unable to focus and has to leave the operating room. When Paul realizes he is responsible for the series of local murders‚Äîwhich he has been committing during his blackouts‚Äîhe arranges for Betsy to stay with an aunt for her own safety. Paul again confronts Will about the pills, but Will assumes Paul is in a delusional state. He agrees to stay with Paul to calm him, and locks the bottle of pills in a drawer. During the night, Will witnesses Paul's transformation into a vampire; Paul then murders Will, disposing of his body in a furnace. The following day, Sheriff Buck Donnelly (Kenneth Tobey)‚Äîsuspicious that Will may be engaging in human experiments‚Äîgoes to question him. At the lab, Buck finds an audio recorder that contains a recording of Will's murder. Meanwhile, Paul's nurse, Carol Butler (Gray), is opening his office when she is confronted by Paul, who urges her to go home. Before leaving, she notices a vial of poison, and realizes Paul may be planning to commit suicide. Before she is able to leave, she witnesses Paul transform into the vampire. Buck arrives shortly after, and witnesses Carol fleeing with Paul in pursuit. She runs into a meadow where she is attacked by Paul, but Buck follows behind and manages to shoot Paul to death. After he dies, his monstrous body reverts to its normal appearance.

Reception Tom Weaver of Fangoria said The Vampire was \\"one of the best independent horror films of the 1950s\\". In a retrospective assessment of the film, Nathaniel Thompson of Turner Classic Movies praised the film's \\"atmospheric\\" musical score and its blending of genres: \\"Taking a cue from Blood of Dracula, The Vampire minimizes the risk of bringing back a still out-of-vogue monster by introducing elements of science fiction, a far more popular genre on movie screens at the time\\". Michael Toole and Jeff Stafford, also of TCM, praised the film, noting: \\"Unfairly lumped with other grade-B horror flicks from its era, The Vampire (1957) actually deserves some credit for adding a new spin - pill addiction - to this overexposed horror genre and placing the story in a contemporary setting\\". Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the movie 2 stars out of 4, noting that it had some merit and singling out Beal's performance for praise.Leonard Maltin, \\"The Vampire\\", Cinemania, 1996. Home media The Vampire was released on DVD in 2007 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a Midnite Movies double feature with The Return of Dracula.

Pera (born March 10, 1978) is the founder of Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. a global communications technology company that Pera took public in 2011. In October 2012, Pera also became the owner of a professional basketball team: The Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association. At the age of 36, Pera earned a spot on Forbes list of the 10 youngest billionaires in the world. Early life and education Pera established his first computer services company while attending high school. That company provided networking and database services to local businesses. Pera also played on his high school's basketball team until a heart condition, which has long since resolved, kept him home for a year. After high school, Pera attended the University of California, San Diego, where he graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and a B.A. in Japanese Language. He stayed on at UC San Diego and completed his masters in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on Digital Communications and Circuit Design. Career=Apple After graduation, Pera, who admired Steve Jobs, secured a job at Apple Inc., where he tested the company's Wi-Fi devices to ensure compliance with Federal Communications Commission standards for electromagnetic emissions. While working at Apple, Pera noticed that the power sources that Apple's Wi-Fi devices used to throw signals were far below FCC limits. Boosting their power, he reasoned, could increase their transmission range to over dozens of miles, which could facilitate Internet access in areas that telephone and cable companies do not reach. When his bosses at Apple ignored his idea, Pera decided to build his own low-cost, high-performance Wi-Fi module. For the next year, Pera spent his nights and weekends in his apartment testing prototypes. By early 2005 he was ready to start his own business and he left Apple to form Ubiquiti Networks. Ubiquiti Networks Pera founded Ubiquiti Networks in March 2005 using only $30,000 of personal savings and credit card debt. Ubiquiti's early products utilized existing Wi-Fi technology to wirelessly deliver the Internet to underserved areas (e.g., rural areas and emerging markets) lacking the infrastructure to access the Internet through traditional avenues such as phone lines and cable lines. The company has since successfully branched out into other product lines such as wireless access points, security cameras and traditional networking equipment (e.g., switches and routers). Memphis Grizzlies On June 11, 2012, sources told ESPN.com that Michael Heisley had an agreement in principle to sell the Memphis Grizzlies to Robert Pera. The official sale of the Memphis Grizzlies to Pera was approved on October 25, 2012. The Grizzlies made the NBA playoffs in the two seasons before Pera purchased the team and made the playoffs during the first five seasons of his tenure as owner. In the first year of Pera's ownership, the Grizzlies won a club record 56 games and made its first-ever appearance in the Western Conference Finals. The Grizzlies team won more playoff games during the first two years of Pera's tenure than it did during the team's 17 previous seasons in the NBA. Pera is a supporter of the Grizzlies Foundation, a sports charity which operates in Memphis. ReferencesExternal links * Robert J. Pera profile page at Forbes.com * Robert J.

Background Upon the return of the liberal politician Giovanni Giolitti to government in June 1920, during the Biennio Rosso, the official attitude towards the Kingdom of Italy's regency of Carnaro constituted in Fiume began to waver. On November 12 of the same year, Italy and Yugoslavia signed the Treaty of Rapallo, forming the Free State of Fiume as a consequence to an occupation of Fiume by Gabriele d'Annunzio and his troops which began with the Impresa di Fiume. D'Annunzio entered Fiume as part of his and many Italians protest for an incomplete victory after World War I, because Italy was denied some of the Eastern Adriatic lands it claimed and was promised at its entry to the war. Occupation The resumption of Italy's premiership by the liberal Giovanni Giolitti in June 1920 signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's coup. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, under which Fiume was to be an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a government acceptable to both. D'Annunzio refused to accept an ultimatum forced upon him to abandon Fiume and claimed the Treaty of Rapallo as illegal. Consequently, his Regency declared war on Italy, further provoking a backlash from the Italian forces, resulting in a cannonade from the Royal Navy. General Enrico Caviglia led his troops against the city, beginning on 24 December 1920 and after just five days occupied the city. Following defeat Following the defeat of d'Annunzio's forces, there was an election of the Constituent Assembly, giving autonomists and independentists an overwhelming victory with 65% of the vote. On 5 October 1921, Riccardo Zanella became the first and only elected president of the short lived Free State of Fiume, however this was unable to end disputes over the city. Seven months later in Rome, Mussolini became prime minister, and Italy started heading towards a fascist regime. As a result, Zanella was overthrown in a putsch by local fascists in March 1922, resulting in an Italian military occupation of the city. This period of diplomatic tension ended with the Treaty of Rome on 27 January 1924, which assigned Fiume to Italy and Su≈°ak along with other villages, to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration.

Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 1 Print. was a prominent Austrian-Hungarian eugenicist and writer. He lived for a time in California as the Austrian Vice-Consulate where he observed and wrote on eugenics practices in the United States. His best known book, Die Rassenhygiene in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika (Racial Hygiene in the United States of America) described his observations in America. His reports on American eugenicist activity influenced German and especially Berlin eugenicists up to the first World War. He served as a key connection between American and German eugenics activities.  Views on eugenics  He shared his views with Germans and Hungarians ‚Äúthat eugenic policies should improve the racial qualities of the nation‚Äù.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 187. Print. He was predominantly concerned with improving the biological quality of the population.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 205. Print. Published in 1913, Racial Hygiene in the United States in America discussed the similarities of eugenics theories such as negative and positive eugenics and so-called practical social policies like sterilization and immigration. He endorsed ‚Äúnegative‚Äù eugenic policies on the practical level, while simultaneously emphasizing their theoretical value.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 199. Print. Negative eugenics programs included any activities that discourage or stop the reproduction or continuation of certain peoples deemed inferior. It could also include programs that simply limit certain people to the state. These programs would include sterilization, immigration bans, separate institutions for different groups, marriage restrictions and more. The people typically picked for negative eugenics were placed in racialized groups or somehow physically or mentally deemed \\"unfit\\". Positive eugenics entailed any programs that encourage reproduction, success or admittance into the state of certain groups considered superior. These programs could include restricting abortions, providing financial aid for additional children and more. According to his book, he viewed marriage limits, immigration laws, and forced sterilization as the best ways to practice eugenics as he observed it in the United States. They were all negative, which was the main criticism about both his work and United States' practice of eugenics. His book Krieg und Rassenhygiene (War and Racial Hygiene) published in 1916 demonstrated his view of war as ultimately destructive to the \\"hereditary strength among European nations.\\" Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 207. Print. According to Hoffman, the best young men, representing the strength of the European nations at war, either died or were injured in other lands which hurt the genetic strength of the population. This observation came after the outbreak of World War I, which resulted in catastrophic loss of life.  Austro-Hungarian influence  Geza von Hoffmann dominated the external group of eugenics in Eastern Europe. He and other members of the external group looked outside of Eastern Europe for influence on eugenics instead of relying on their own nations. His work, along with the work of other notable eugenicists in the Eugenic Society in Hungary, made that country between 1910 and 1918 the ‚Äúvanguard of eugenic thinking in Europe.\\" He compared and combined eugenics ideas in both Germany and United States and theorized about applying the combined concepts to Hungary society.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 186. Print. In his article titled \\"Eugenics in the Central Empires since 1914\\", he compared various eugenics societies and their different activities. He compared the German Society for Racial Hygiene, the German Society for Racial Hygiene in Munich, the International Society for Racial Hygiene, the Austrian Society for the Study of the Science of Population, the Czech Society for Eugenics, the Hungarian Society for Racial Hygiene and Population Policy.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 1- 2. Print. Hoffmann further developed the concept of eugenics in Austria-Hungary and later internationally. He believed other eugenicists like Istv√°n Ap√°thy and Madzsar were too focused on the \\"social and political\\" aspects of eugenics. He believed eugenics study needed to look at and understand the biological aspect of the practice. He argued that the \\"biological perspective\\" was the most important aspect of understanding eugenics and racial hygiene.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 198. Print.  German connections  Hoffman was among a group of Central and Southeast European eugenicists educated in Germany and Austria.Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 9. Print. Despite being an Austro-Hungarian diplomat he \\"had strong connections with German racial hygiene.\\" Before the 1920s, Hofmann was the strongest connection between German and American eugenicists. World War I made it more difficult to keep up that contact.K√ºhl, Stefan. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. pp. 18. Print. However, despite the loss in contact, he continued to influenced German eugenic practices significantly with his observations on American eugenic practices.  American observations  Hoffmann was a rare European observer of eugenics in the early 1900s, and he offered a comprehensive research of eugenic legislation in United States. He lived for several years in California as the Austrian vice-consulate. He kept his German colleagues, especially his Berlin colleagues, and even the German public, informed about the development of racial eugenics in United States.II. K√ºhl, Stefan. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. pp. 16 Print. In 1913, his book Die Rassenhygiene in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika (Racial Hygiene in the United States of America) was used as a standard work of the early American eugenics movement. It outlined the scientific basis of eugenics. He explained the widespread acceptance of eugenic principles in United States. He argued that the ideas of Galton, Mendel and Darwin, ‚Äútheories of evolution and decay, importance of heredity, and the possibility of race improvement‚Äù were becoming a part of American science and social life. He described how even the American Presidents supported some forms of eugenics. He quoted Woodrow Wilson's presidential address where President Wilson acknowledges ‚Äúthat the whole nation has awakened to and recognizes the extraordinary importance of the science of human heredity, as well as its application to the ennoblement of the human family.\\" He quoted another President, Theodore Roosevelt, who used Edward A. Ross's phrase ‚Äúrace suicide\\" as his own. Perhaps most importantly to German eugenicists, he described how American federal and state agencies were lending structure and financial support to eugenic research. He outlined American marriage restrictions of ‚Äúfeebleminded‚Äù persons and he included information on the thirty-two states that forbid marriage and sexual relations between blacks and whites. He discussed the first eugenic sterilization performed in the United States in Indiana in 1899. According to Hoffmann, it was performed with no legal basis. In 1907 the doctor in charge of the procedure asked the Indiana legislature to create laws permitting sterilization of mentally handicapped persons. He documented the many states that followed suit in passing sterilization laws. *1909 California and Connecticut *1911 Nevada, Iowa, and New Jersey *1912 New York *1913 Kansas, Michigan, North Dakota, Oregon In his final chapter of the book, Hoffman addressed the fact that American eugenics is based on the concept of Charles Woodruff (American Eugenicist) that northwest Europeans are ‚Äúour best citizens.\\"II. K√ºhl, Stefan. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. pp. 17. Print. In 1910, he reported in the Journal of the International Society for Racial Hygiene, (Archiv f√ºr Rassen- und Gesellschaft) on a proposal by the American Genetic Association led by Harry H. Laughlin which stated that the ‚Äúlowest 10 percent of American population be sterilized‚Äù. However, he became less in favor of United States eugenic goals over time. He claimed that ‚Äúrash actions, the lack of a powerful bureaucratic system, and the peculiarity of the American Constitution were partially responsible for getting sterilization laws passed, but also contributed to their poor enforcement‚Äù.  Influence in Germany  Hoffmann's work helped shape German's view of the United State. It revealed the importance of eugenics in United States to German eugenicists. German eugenicists often referred to his work in addition to the work of Harry Laughlin.II. K√ºhl, Stefan. The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. New York: Oxford UP, 2002. pp. 25. Print. In part because of Hoffmann's work, the United States was considered by German eugenicists to be the \\"first country to enforce comprehensive eugenics legislation.\\" German eugenicists also believed that racial conflicts in the United States were what pushed such a systemized eugenics movement. In addition, because of Hoffmann's work, the United States was also looked down upon by German eugenicists for \\"lack of enforcement.\\" Hoffmann's assumed a pivotal historical significance for the eugenics movement in Germany. His connection reveals the importance of American eugenics to Germans before World War I and shows how American and German histories are connected.  Recognition = General  Hoffmann was acknowledged as an expert in Germany and America on eugenics. Turda, Marius, and Paul Weindling. \\"Blood and Homeland\\": Eugenics and Racial Nationalism in Central and Southeast Europe, 1900-1940. Budapest: Central European UP, 2007. pp. 203. Print. He ‚Äúcontributed to European and American debates on racial hygiene, eugenics and sterilization.‚Äù His books and articles were published in both Hungary and abroad. He first propagated his eugenics views in Hungary and then to the broader audience in the rest of Europe and North America.  Germany  Hoffmann was praised for providing insight into eugenicist activities, structures, and attitudes in the United States. He was however, criticized by Fritz Lenz who argued that Americans had a better negative eugenics operation but not enough positive eugenics. Lenz believed American leaders were not pushing American women to have enough children. Lenz said it was a problem of ‚Äúextreme dominance of the ladies.\\" Essentially, according to Lenz, American was doing enough to stop inferior reproduction but needed to encourage superior reproduction. Lenz also believed that women in America had too much choice about reproduction.  United States  Hoffmann's work was respected in the United States in some circles as evidenced by the review of his book in the Bulletin of the American Academy of Medicine. His book Die Rassenhygiene in den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika (Racial Hygiene in United States) first published in 1913 was reviewed in the 14th Volume in 1913. The bulletin reported that, while in United States as Vice-Counsel of Austria-Hungary, he gathered significant material for his book. The book, according to the bulletin, is a good examination of the United States eugenics activities from chapter one's foundation of eugenics, chapter two's spread of eugenics in the America, chapter three's \\"marriage regulations with eugenics purpose\\", chapter four's sterilization of the degenerate and chapter five's selection of the immigrant. The bulletin especially gave credit to the appendix that included marriage laws, sterilization laws, immigration laws, an \\"admirable bibliography comprising 927 numbers,\\" and index of authors. According to the bulletin, there was \\"no other work which gives a more complete or concise statement of the progress of eugenics in the United States and every student of the subject should have access to the volume.\\" American Academy of Medicine. \\"Notes and Notices.\\" Bulletin of the American Academy of Medicine.

Singer: October 21, 1944, in New York City ‚Äì June 5, 2000) was a U.S. activist, particularly for LGBT rights, and a gay marriage pioneer, filing one of the first gay marriage lawsuits in American history after being denied a marriage license at the King County Administration Building in Seattle, Washington in 1971. Biography Singer was born New York City to Jewish parents of Lithuanian and Polish background Irving and Miriam Singer. He and his two younger brothers Michael and Thomas and his younger sister Judith were raised in a non-religious, politically aware household in Mount Vernon, New York. He came out to his parents in 1963 or 1964, to the initial consternation and eventual acceptance of his mother and the long-running anger of his father. He served as a VISTA volunteer for civil-rights causes in the mid-1960s, applied for conscientious-objector status and served as an Army medic in Germany. Studying at City College of New York, he received his liberal arts degree in 1970. Later that year, he left for San Francisco and, later, went to Seattle. On September 20, 1971, Singer and fellow activist Paul Barwick applied for a marriage license at the King County Administration Building in Seattle, not being keen on actually getting married but wanting \\"to make a point about having the same rights as heterosexuals.\\" Their request was refused by then-county auditor (and current County Assessor) Lloyd Hara. They were among the first same-sex couples in the United States to apply for a marriage license, causing a flurry of media coverage and leading to a lawsuit, Singer v. Hara, which ended in 1974 with a unanimous rejection by the Washington State Court of Appeals. Singer worked as a typist for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, but his taste for women's clothing and his open disclosure of his homosexuality resulted in him being fired after one year in 1972, despite the protests of co-workers. He sued the EEOC with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in his favor in 1974, with the U.S. Supreme Court remanding the case back to the Ninth Circuit, essentially instructing it to rule in ben Miriam's favor, resulting in his receiving back pay from the entire span of the lawsuit. The suit also resulted in the EEOC enforcing prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of sexual preference. While Ben-Miriam did not go back to the EEOC, he took up a job with the U.S. Department of Labor, from which he retired in 1995. In 1973, Singer changed his name to Faygele Ben-Miriam, Faygele being the Yiddish word for \\"little bird\\", used both as a woman's first name and a derogatory Yiddish term for \\"faggot\\", \\"ben\\" meaning \\"son of\\" in Hebrew and Yiddish, and Miriam being his mother's name, thus stressing both his Jewish and his gay identity. Ben-Miriam also participated in the Radical Faeries in Wolf Creek, Oregon and for a while published RFD, virtually single-handedly. He was active on the National Board of the New Jewish Agenda, worked with the International Jewish Peace Union and was active in Kadima of Seattle. He died on June 5, 2000, at the age of 55. According to his sister, he died of lung cancer (he had been a heavy smoker) which metastasized to his brain. Although he had been HIV positive for several years, he did not die of AIDS, a fact which, again according to his sister, annoyed him: he would have preferred that his death be as political as his life. Ben-Miriam helped found the Gay Community Social Services of Seattle and also produced the first gay country music album, Lavender Country.

Features  The Flucard is compatible with any device with an SD host slot. Once the Flucard is plugged into the device, the device gains Wi-Fi functionality and will be able to wirelessly transmit files (i.e. photos and videos) to other Wi-Fi enabled devices. The Flucard also allows users to wirelessly upload files from the host devices to an online Flucard Portal or an alternative server of choice.  History  In 2005, Henn Tan, the chief executive officer and chairman of Trek 2000 International, was on an overseas trip with his family in China. On the third day of the tour, Tan's daughter's camera went missing. Tan would later recount that it was not so much the cost of the equipment but the loss of three days' worth of invaluable memories that affected him. Out of this ordeal, however, came the idea for a new product. Tan saw the potential for a better way to quickly and effectively store and protect such data on-the-go. When he got back to Singapore, Tan committed the company's research and development team to create an \\"intelligent\\" SD card that could wirelessly transmit files. In 2008 the Flucard started to materialise. The name \\"Flucard\\" was purportedly chosen as Tan believes that the adoption of the Flucard would spread like a contagious flu, eventually displacing the standard SD card. Trek is one of the claimants to the invention of the ThumbDrive, the disruptive technology that replaced the floppy disk as the medium-of-choice for digital storage. In 2010, Trek, together with its long-time partner Toshiba, jointly launched the forum \\"Standard Promotion Forum for Memory Cards Embedding Wireless LAN\\" to promote the adoption of the Flucard.

Saint-Cyr outmaneuvered his opponents, distracting them with a false attack in front while sending the bulk of his force across Llobregat River in a turning movement around the Spanish right flank. The Spanish defensive lines crumbled and the French captured 1,200 soldiers, all the Spanish artillery and Caldagues himself. The Peninsular War engagement was fought near Molins de Rei, located west of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The Dos de Mayo Uprising caught the Imperial French occupation forces in Spain off guard. By the end of August 1808, the Franco-Italian garrison of Barcelona found itself isolated and in danger of capture. Emperor Napoleon soon assembled a substantial army, entrusted it to Saint-Cyr, and directed his general to relieve Barcelona. After a risky campaign, Saint-Cyr defeated a Spanish force at Cardadeu and reached Barcelona. Finding his opponents holding a strong position behind the Llobregat, Saint-Cyr marched out of Barcelona and resolved to drive them away. Prelude=Strategic situation After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, Emperor Napoleon began to exhibit such signs of megalomania that his brilliant diplomat Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord resigned as foreign minister. Undeterred, Napoleon got King Charles IV of Spain and his son Prince Ferdinand into his custody and then tricked both into abdicating. Then he announced that his brother Joseph Bonaparte would reign as the Spanish king. Meanwhile, on various pretexts, Napoleon moved significant bodies of Imperial French troops into Spain. In February 1808, these soldiers seized Barcelona and many border fortresses. On 2 May 1808, street riots in Madrid were put down with extreme measures by Marshal Joachim Murat and 20,000 Imperial troops. Very soon, the Spanish people rose in rebellion against the French occupation forces. Guillaume Philibert Duhesme commanded the Corps of Observation of the Eastern Pyrenees which numbered 12,714 men. The 1st Division under Joseph Chabran was made up of one Swiss and seven French battalions and counted 6,045 soldiers. The 2nd Division under Teodoro Lechi had 4,596 troops in four Italian and two Neapolitan battalions. The cavalry brigade led by Bertrand Bessi√®res numbered 825 troopers in two French provisional regiments, while the cavalry brigade commanded by Fran√ßois Xavier de Schwarz counted 892 Italian and Neapolitan horsemen. There were also 356 artillerymen and wagon drivers. Napoleon expected Duhesme to help capture Valencia and Lleida as well as hold Barcelona. These instructions proved to be hopelessly optimistic, given Duhesme's limited numbers and the intensity of the spreading revolt. The Battles of El Bruch were two unsuccessful attempts to clear the El Bruc pass, first by Schwarz and then by Chabran. Taking half his corps, Duhesme tried to clear the road to France, but in the Battle of Gerona his troops were unable to storm the city. Napoleon realized that Duhesme needed help, so he scraped together 8,000 second-class French soldiers into a new division and assigned it to Honor√© Charles Reille. First, Reille marched to the relief of the Sant Ferran Castle at Figueres, then he tried to capture the port of Roses (Rosas) but failed. In late July, Reille and Duhesme converged on Girona from north and south and began the Second Siege of Gerona. This operation progressed so slowly that Conde de Caldagues attacked the siege lines and forced the French to withdraw. Reille retired to Figueres with little trouble, but the miquelets, a Catalan militia, harassed Duhesme's soldiers unmercifully. Duhesme had to abandon his artillery and wagon train before his troops escaped to Barcelona on 20 August 1808. Operations When Napoleon finally understood the scope of the problem in Catalonia, he made some significant changes. Already on 17 August 1808, Napoleon appointed Laurent Gouvion Saint- Cyr to be his new commander in Catalonia. Saint-Cyr was reinforced by 18,000 men from the garrison of Italy, though it would be weeks before they could arrive. Unlike Reille's motley soldiers, these included crack troops in the French division of Joseph Souham and the Italian division of Domenico Pino. There was also a small Franco-Italian division under Louis Fran√ßois Jean Chabot, an Italian cavalry brigade led by Jacques Fontane, and the French 24th Dragoon Regiment. Battle of Cardedeu, 16 December 1808 Meanwhile, 10,000 Spanish regulars were idle in the Balearic Islands because their commander Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu was afraid that his new British allies planned to seize the islands. After the soldiers threatened to mutiny, Vives finally allowed Marquis del Palacio to sail to the mainland with 5,000 men. These troops landed in Catalonia by 23 July. The local authorities appointed Del Palacio the new Captain General of Catalonia and he opened a blockade of Barcelona. About 10,000 Spanish troops under Theodor von Reding from the Province of Granada were approaching Catalonia. A division from the Province of Aragon under Luis Rebolledo de Palafox y Melci, 1st marqu√©s de Laz√°n reached Lleida. Palacio remained so inert during the summer and fall that he was replaced as Captain General by Vives on 28 October. By this time the Spanish numbered 20,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Vives tightened the blockade of Barcelona and finally drove the garrison within its walls on 26 November. Other than that, Vives proved to be as slow and unenterprising as Palacio. Saint-Cyr opened the Siege of Roses on 7 November 1808 and Roses surrendered on 5 December. This removed a potential threat to the French communications. Saint-Cyr arrived before the fortress of Girona with 17,000 troops in the second week of December. He hoped to lure the Spanish garrison outside the walls, but this tactic did not work. The commander at Girona, Mariano √Ålvarez de Castro and Laz√°n refused to risk their 8,000 soldiers in the open field against Saint-Cyr's much superior force. The French commander knew that besieging Girona would take too long, so he sent away his artillery and his wagon trains and boldly slipped past Girona, leaving Reille's division behind. Vives assumed that the French would be stalled in front of Girona. When he found that Saint-Cyr was marching through the hills, he responded by sending a division under Reding to block the French. Vives finally woke up and brought an additional brigade, though he had 24,000 troops available. Saint- Cyr completely outfoxed his opponents and arrived near the village of Cardadeu to find Vives and Reding facing him with only 9,100 soldiers and seven cannons. In the Battle of Cardadeu on 16 December Saint-Cyr utilized massive attack columns to smash through the Spanish lines. The French inflicted 2,500 casualties on their adversaries while suffering a loss of only 600. Vives became separated from his army. He fled to the coast where he was picked up by and shipped to Tarragona. Battle=Preparations Laurent Gouvion Saint- Cyr On 16 December, Conde de Caldagues drove off a strong sortie that was mounted by the defenders of Barcelona, but that evening he heard about the Spanish defeat at Cardedeu. Accordingly, Caldagues withdrew the blockading force behind the Llobregat River to positions from Molins de Rei on the north and Sant Boi de Llobregat on the south. During the hasty retreat, Caldagues abandoned a large food depot at Sarri√† to the Imperial French. On the morning of 17 December, Saint-Cyr led his army of relief into Barcelona. To his annoyance, no soldiers from the blockaded garrison were sent out to greet his victorious soldiers. When the egotistical Duhesme finally appeared, he remarked to Saint-Cyr that his forces were not in danger and would have been able to hold out for another six weeks. Not to be outdone, the prickly Saint- Cyr produced a copy of one of Duhesme's dispatches to Marshal Louis-Alexandre Berthier stating that his garrison was in dire straits and begging for its relief. Duhesme withdrew to sulk in silence. After being deserted by about 1,000 of his miquelets, Caldagues counted 11,000 troops. These were soon joined by Reding who brought the remnants of the force beaten at Cardedeu, 3,000‚Äì4,000 men. The lines along the Llobregat included the field fortifications built for the right wing of the blockade and they were only about from the Barcelona suburbs. The defenses were strong and mounted heavy guns, but were too long for an army of 15,000 soldiers. The Llobregat was fordable at many points and if the French assault came at one point it was likely to succeed. In the absence of Vives, the second-in-command Reding took control of the Spanish forces. He and the third-in-command Caldagues knew the Spanish position was weak but they were in a dilemma. Reding and Caldagues wanted to retreat west into the very strong position at Ordal, where they planned to construct an entrenched camp. However, a withdrawal to Ordal would open the Barcelona‚ÄìLleida highway to the French. It would also allow the French to gather up the crops in the plains. Looking for some direction, Reding sent a message to Vives who was at Sitges. Vives failed to assume responsibility, leaving it to Reding to decide whether to defend or retreat. Vives' reply arrived on the night of 20‚Äì21 December. In order to demonstrate his courage in the eyes of the Catalans, Reding determined to fight. Imperial forces Saint-Cyr led four divisions out of the city on the windy and cold morning of 21 December 1808, leaving Duhesme to hold Barcelona with Lechi's Italian division. The Imperial forces included the divisions of Chabran, Souham, Pino, and Chabot. Chabran's division was part of Duhesme's corps which had been blockaded in Barcelona. Chabran's troops were French veterans plus one battalion of Swiss. Souham's French and Pino's Italian divisions were made up of crack troops. Chabot's division consisted of one battalion of French soldiers and two of Neapolitans. The Neapolitans were widely regarded as the worst troops in Europe. Saint-Cyr's force also included Fontane's cavalry brigade, consisting of the Italian Royal Horse Chasseurs and the 7th Italian Dragoons. Action Map shows the Battle of Molins de Rei. Chabran's division feinted at the bridge at the upper right, while Saint-Cyr's main attack crossed the river at the bottom and wheeled to the right. Saint- Cyr planned for Chabran's 4,000-man division to mount a diversionary attack on Molins de Rey bridge. While the Spanish generals were distracted, 14,000 troops in the divisions of Souham, Pino, and Chabot would cross the lower fords of the Llobregat and march against the Spanish right flank. At 5:00 am, Chabran began his feint against the Spanish left flank. Reding was fooled and reinforced his left by drawing some troops from his right flank. At 6:00 am the real Imperial assault began when Saint-Cyr ordered his other three divisions to advance. Souham's division crossed at the ford of Sant Joan Desp√≠. The Spanish troops of the center began to march downhill to oppose Souham, but they flinched and did not push their attack. The divisions of Pino and Chabot crossed farther south at San Feliu against weak opposition. The Imperial French soon cracked the overextended Spanish line in several locations. Chabot's small division on the extreme left swept completely around the Spanish right flank. As Chabot's troops moved deeper into the Spanish rear, the troops fighting against Pino and Souham were compelled to yield good defensive terrain and fall back. The Imperial advance rolled up the broken Spanish left and center, thrusting them toward the north in a confused mass. Soon crowds of retreating soldiers began to appear in Chabran's front. This was the moment for Chabran to convert his false attack into an actual assault, but he hesitated. By the time Chabran's troops splashed across the Llobregat, most of the Spanish troops had fled beyond their reach. Vives belatedly arrived on the battlefield at this time. Seeing his troops running for their lives, Vives immediately decamped. Saint-Cyr unleashed his dragoons in pursuit of his enemies and they caught the Conde de Caldagues when his horse collapsed. The French captured 1,200 men, 25 cannons, a magazine containing 3,000,000 cartridges, and many muskets thrown away by the fleeing Spanish soldiers. Another source claimed that the Spanish sustained losses of 1,000 soldiers killed and wounded plus 1,200 men, 25 guns, and one color captured. The French lost 400 killed and wounded out of a total of 18,000 men and 48 guns. Historian Charles Oman wrote that the French were weak in artillery and that the field guns captured from the Spanish proved very useful. He noted that Saint-Cyr's troops brought no guns with them and that much of Duhesme's artillery was lost in the retreat after the Second Siege of Gerona. Aftermath Theodor von Reding Most of the routed Spanish soldiers fled to Tarragona for sanctuary, while others headed for Lleida or Tortosa. In their wake, the victorious Imperial French troops occupied the watershed of the Llobregat and areas to the west, including the important defile at Ordal. Souham's division took post at El Vendrell, Pino's at Sitges and Vilafranca del Pened√®s, Chabran's at Martorell, and Chabot's at Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia. Saint-Cyr believed securing enough food for his army was his first priority and reopening his supply line with France was his second priority. It would be difficult for the French to supply Barcelona by sea with warships of the British Royal Navy hovering off the coast. Meanwhile, the inland route was blocked by Spanish-held Girona and Hostalric. Saint-Cyr found other reasons for pausing in his victorious march. The winter campaigning exhausted his soldiers and they needed to recuperate. The Spanish troops under Alvarez and Laz√°n harassed Reille's division near Girona. Saint-Cyr might have tried to capture Tarragona, but he believed that he would need a siege train and a large supply of ammunition in order to reduce that powerful fortress. He was unaware that most of the miquelets had gone home, the regular infantry were becoming mutinous, and the Catalan people were in a state of hysteria, howling for scapegoats. In Lleida, a local man named Gomez seized power and began executing anyone whom he suspected of treason. Reding finally put a stop to this by sending a battalion to the city to arrest and execute the tyrant. When the pressure from Saint-Cyr relaxed, the Catalans began to rally. The second echelon of Reding's Granadan troops arrived at the front and reinforcements also came from Mallorca. The Granadans included the Santa F√© and 1st Antequera Regiments while the Mallorcans consisted of the Beschard Swiss Regiment and the Palma Militia. The Spanish authorities induced the incompetent Vives to resign and replaced him with Reding, who was at least courageous though not brilliant. The miquelets returned to duty so that one month after Molins de Rei, the Army of Catalonia counted 30,000 men. On 1 January 1809, Laz√°n ambushed and mauled the 4th Battalion of the French 2nd Line Infantry Regiment, killing and wounding 200 men and capturing 90 more. When Reille and 2,500 troops tried to exact revenge he met with a stinging repulse. However, Laz√°n soon withdrew his division from Catalonia and marched to help his brother Jos√© de Palafox y Melci whose army was fighting the Second Siege of Zaragoza. Saint-Cyr kept his troops busy gathering food supplies and suppressing the miquelets. The Imperial troops cleared the El Bruc pass and captured Montserrat but did not occupy it. Occasional ships got through the British blockade to keep Barcelona fed. It was only later that a system of convoys was begun. The next large engagement in Catalonia was the Battle of Valls on 25 February 1809.

The mall is spread across the first eight floors of the building, and includes fashion, food, beauty, entertainment and business meeting facilities. It stands on a land operated by the Gelora Bung Karno Complex Management Center, who also operates the nearby Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex. The building also contains apartments above the mall level 8, including hotel accommodation by Harris Hotel. The tenth floor contains a gym, pool and tennis court. The complex along with the mall and apartment tower, was known as Sudirman Place from 2006 to 2008. The apartment tower is 213 meters tall and one of the tallest apartment tower in Jakarta. The apartment tower was known as The Pinnacle from 2006 to 2008, which is now named as FX Residence.  History  fX Sudirman was first established and officially open in February 2006 as Sudirman Place by PT Aneka Bina Lestari who manages it with a concept that melds family mall and boutique mall. Although there were already two big malls (Senayan City and Plaza Senayan) close to the area, the owner was confident that the mall going to be very successful considering its strategic location, being easily reached from patrons arriving from several direction. When it was first established, around a hundred tenants agreed to open in the new mall, however less than ten tenants opened at the launch, namely Nichols Edward, Bali Deli, Zuma and Starbucks. Most of the tenants cancelled their agreement to open in the mall, or closed soon after opening because the mall suffered from a lack of visitors. According to Bagus Y. Prastowo, GM Advertising and Promotion FX Plaza, the family mall concept with 100 tenants wouldn't work because its size (30 thousand m2) was as too small compared to the other malls close by with 150 thousand m2 space. Sudirman Place officially closed in November 2006. The building management was then taken over by PT Plaza Lifestyle Prima (Group PT Plaza Indonesia Realty Tbk/PIR) who saw potential based on its location, provided it could be positioned in the market as complementary to the malls nearby. After three months comparative study, a further six months was taken to create the new concept for the mall. The new management uses overseas building designer Denton Corker Marshall and its architect Budiman (Principal Architect), the same company who designed Plaza eX. After actively promoting it creatively and intensively, Henny Udi Marketing Director from PT Plaza Lifestyle Prima as the sister company of Plaza Indonesia Realty (PIR) manages to increase tenant occupancy rate from 25 percent to 97 percent. It is reopened in July 2008 as fX Plaza. The previous tenants were encouraged to stay with one condition that they should follow the \\"new concept\\", or their contracts were settled \\"peacefully\\", according to Henny Udi (Leasing Director). When it is first opened, the new concept manages to attract five thousand visitors daily to the mall. The mall provided 20 Mbit/s free wifi in every floor. with over 200 access points. and Atmosfear Slide was added to the mall. the slide designed by Legacy Entertainment. In June 2011, the apartment is taken over by Tauzia Hotel Management and operated its seventh hotel chain (Harris Hotel) and introduce it as \\"Harris Suites\\" inside fX Sudirman. It has 88 rooms and uses an already established facility for the apartment. In July 2012, the mall celebrates four years since the reopening.  Land dispute  fX building is part of land dispute surrounding Gelora Bung Karno area. According to Hakam Naja as the Head of Indonesia Country Asset Working Committee the funding received from fX mall is supposed to go to the country's asset instead of Indonesian National Sport Committee (KONI). Bomb threat In November 2008, the building received a bomb threat sent to Indonesian police SMS number 1717, U.S. Embassy and Australian Embassy.  fPod  When it is re opens in mid 2008 the building \\"new concept\\" also offered 11 closed meeting places known as \\"fPod\\".

Created by Adam Reed as one of the show's original supporting characters, Cheryl is played by Judy Greer. Greer auditioned for the role because of her desire to break into voice acting, after previous efforts had failed. For Archer Vice, the comedy's fifth season, Jessy Lynn Martens provided the character's singing voice. Cheryl made her debut in Archer first episode, \\"Mole Hunt\\", on September 17, 2009. Cheryl, part of the wealthy Tunt family, is introduced as the incompetent personal assistant to Malory Archer (Jessica Walter). She is portrayed as an emotionally fragile, ditzy personality in Archer early years; among her attributes are her choking fetish and addiction to rubber cement. In later seasons of the comedy, Cheryl assumes new personae‚Äînotably Cherlene in Archer Vice and Charlotte Vandertunt in Archer Dreamland‚Äîand evolves into an increasingly neurotic character. Her characterization has been well received by the media, as has Greer's acting. At the 39th Annie Awards, Greer received an Annie Award nomination for outstanding achievement in voice acting. Arc and personality Cheryl Tunt debuted in Archer first episode, \\"Mole Hunt\\", as the incompetent secretary of Malory Archer (Jessica Walter). Cheryl's early storylines focus on her attempts to sabotage Cyril Figgis' (Chris Parnell) relationship with Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), whom she greatly despises. Cyril, emasculated by Lana and increasingly suspicious of her relationship with Sterling Archer (H. Jon Benjamin), agrees to have sex with Cheryl. Paranoid that Lana may discover his infidelity, he distances himself from Cheryl afterward, much to her dismay. Cheryl threatens to tell Lana of their affair to force him into continuing it, although in a conversation with Pam Poovey (Amber Nash), she reveals her true intentions were to make Sterling jealous. Though Lana catches Cyril cheating with Framboise, the former human relations head at the Organization of Democratic Intelligence Networks (ODIN), Cheryl nonetheless reveals the affair to her, adding more tension to their rivalry. As heiress to the Tunt family railroad fortune, Cheryl is subjected to numerous threats and kidnappings. She and her brother Cecil (Eugene Mirman) inherit US$1 billion in trust funds after the death of their parents; the fortune is split evenly amongst each party, and Cheryl's net worth balloons tenfold. This results in an attempted kidnapping, which ultimately fails when the robbers mistake Pam for Cheryl. Cecil even attempts to extort her wealth after an unprofitable investment in an undersea research facility leaves him bankrupt. Cheryl is introduced as an emotionally fragile woman who craves Sterling's affection. The character becomes an increasingly maniacal and unstable personality in Archer evolution. Greer recalled in an interview, \\"It was really fun to see her evolve and I think [Reed] and I always had fun recording together. I'm so thankful that it got so crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun.\\" Cheryl's instability has resulted in involuntary commitment, and she is often sexually aroused from being choked. Reviewers have described Cheryl as \\"incompetent\\", \\"insane\\", \\"glue-chugging\\", and \\"empty-headed\\". Throughout Archer early seasons, the character creates a number of aliases as part of one of the comedy's longtime running gags. > My interpretation is that she isn‚Äôt trying to keep the secret. That she > doesn‚Äôt care. She changed her last name to avoid getting kidnapped, but > really, if anyone figured it out and asked her, she‚Äôd just probably be like > ‚ÄúYeah, shut up!‚Äù or whatever. I feel like everyone at ISIS is so self- > involved and so concerned with furthering their own agenda that it would > never occur to them to think that anyone else has anything else going on. In the show's subsequent years, Cheryl assumes a number of new personae‚Äîthe rising country music superstar known professionally as Cherlene, and Charlotte Vandertunt, heiress to the Vandertunt media empire. Development Judy Greer, the voice of Cheryl Tunt Judy Greer provides the voice of Cheryl Tunt. Greer came to the Archer producers' attention for her work in Glenn Martin, DDS, and she joined the show because of her desire to break into voice acting, after previous attempts had failed. She and casting director Linda Lamontagne, whom she worked with in Glenn Martin, DDS, consulted with the producers in Los Angeles for the role: \\"She was kind of relentless with them, saying 'Use her, use her.' I read for many different roles and then finally they cast me.\\" When Greer began recording her lines at a studio in Phoenix, she believed Archer was too raunchy to be commissioned for network TV. The actress said, \\"So when I found out it was picked up, I was like, 'Oh! Wait, I don't know what you're talking about.' They said, 'Remember that thing?' And I went, 'Really?' So then I recorded a bunch of them, and the scripts were the funniest scripts that I've ever read, and so crazy.\\" Animators based Cheryl's initial physical appearance on Siobhan Price, a writer and producer at Adult Swim.https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/how-it-feels-become-face-generations- shrugging-indifference-163827/ Prior to Greer's casting, Cheryl was expected to be merely a supporting character for Archer, part of a running gag where Sterling impregnates Malory's secretaries. Reed remarked, \\"Whenever it happened, they would gas them with sleeping gas and just leave them on the steps at Bellevue Hospital with no ID or memory of what just happened. But when Judy agreed to do the show, Cheryl became a much more important character.\\" Reception Cheryl's characterization and Greer's voice work has been well received by the media. HitFix's Alan Sepinwall called Cheryl his favorite character on the show. In her review for \\"El Secuestro\\", Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club felt that Greer's performance was an episode highlight, where she effectively captures her character's quirk. VanDerWerff wrote, \\"Greer is mostly just asked to say crazy things as Cheryl, and that‚Äôs fun, but she steps it up here, playing both Cheryl‚Äôs insanity and the part of her that‚Äôs a spoiled trust-fund kid who‚Äôs found a day job and has to ride the subway with a dwarf that freaks her out.\\" Likewise, Ian MacDonald of TV Overmind said the writers \\"found a great way to expand on ISIS' most emotionally unstable employees\\"; \\"Cheryl, whose crazy has been escalated to an almost extreme,\\" MacDonald stated, \\"seems almost justified in her maladjusted- ness. She's a billionaire heiress who owns an ocelot and drinks glue [...]. Humor involving insane rich people just no[t] getting it is usually pretty funny, and if anyone can pull it off, it's Adam Reed and [Judy] Greer.\\" Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and H. Jon Benjamin, Greer was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production‚Äîthe award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.

The two musicians made a connection, and when Schaaf moved to Brooklyn at the same time as Tapper in 2010, they decided to perform together officially as Yellow Ostrich. After recording their first studio album, The Mistress, the band enlisted the help of multi-instrumentalist Jon Natchez to help achieve their sound on stage. Natchez had played previously with numerous other indie bands including The Antlers and Beirut, and eventually became an official band member. While on tour in 2011, the band signed to Barsuk Records, who released the band's sophomore LP, Strange Land. On June 10, 2013, the band announced that Jon was leaving the band to pursue other things. At that time, they announced that Jared Van Fleet and Zach Rose (who had been with the group since January 2013) were officially joining the band. On November 7, 2014, Yellow Ostrich released a statement on their official Facebook page that they would be disbanding after their final performance, which occurred on December 8, 2014 at Glasslands Gallery in Brooklyn, New York.

The star is 65 light years from earth. The class of this white dwarf is DAe meaning that it has a cool helium rich atmosphere. This star exhibits emission lines showing the Zeeman effect in the hydrogen Balmer spectrum. GD 356 belongs to a class of high field magnetic white dwarfs (HFMWD), but it is unique in that the split lines are purely emission lines with no absorption. The emission region appears to be due to a heated upper layer in the photosphere in which the magnetic field is uniform to within 10%. The emission can be produced by an atmosphere at 7500K in a gravity field of 106 ms‚àí2 and a magnetic field of 13 megaGauss. The magnetically split emission lines, HŒ± and HŒ≤, are circularly polarised. One explanation is that it is caused by a large electric current flowing between the poles of the star and a highly conducting planet. Other explanations such as being due to Bondi-Hoyle accretion or due to a corona are ruled out by the lack of radio and X-ray emissions. Accretion of gas at a low rate over a broad area of the star, only results in heating at levels high in the atmosphere and not down to the opacity depth of 1.0 as observed with these lines. The spectrum does not vary over periods of hours or days. This indicates that the rotation axis must match the magnetic dipole axis. The power radiated by the emission lines is 1027 erg s‚àí1. Overall light from the white dwarf varies by 0.2% smoothly over a period of 117 minutes. Explanations given for the variation are a dark spot rotating with the star. This could be near the rotation pole when viewed nearly edge on, or could be on the equator with the pole pointing roughly towards Earth. Other catalog names for this are LP 137-43, EGGR 329 and WD 1639+537. Properties The mass of GD 356 is whereas when it was a main sequence star it would have had a mass of . In order to reach a temperature of 7510 K it would have become a white dwarf about 1.6 Gya. Prior to this the main sequence lifetime would have been 500 million years giving it a total age of 2.1 billion years. The current magnitude is 15. The absolute visual magnitude is +13.43¬±0.16. Proper motion is 0.24\\" pa, in direction 212¬∞. The trigometric parallax is 21.1 parsecs. Tangential motion is 25 km‚àí1. Spectrum The HŒ± line splitting is 44.5 nm. In similar white dwarfs an absorption line is expected to be seen instead, so that means the emission has sufficient energy to overpower any absorption. The emission was originally discovered by Jesse L. Greenstein. The original HŒ± line has a wavelength at 655.2 nm and is called the œÄ component. The blue shifted component œÉ‚àí has wavelength 633.4 nm and red shifted component line œÉ+ is at 678.2 nm. Possible companion The unipolar-inductor theory says that a high-conduction companion orbits. As it moves through the star's magnetic field, a high voltage is produced between the star facing side of the planet and the dark side. A current then flows along field lines to the point on the star where the field lines meet the star's photosphere, the current is completed through the photosphere heating it up. A planet in a close orbit would develop the shape of the Roche potential and is very likely to be molten due to tidal heating. A planet with a density of over five g/cm3 is stable at an orbital period longer than 4.7 hours. A planet in this kind of orbit may have a temperature of 560 K and could be detectable in infrared if it was large enough. Infrared observations rule out a large companion such as a brown dwarf or other large planet over twelve Jupiter masses. This is based on the expected temperature of 2.1 billion year old planets. A planet could possibly get into this situation by evaporating while orbiting inside the gaseous shell of the red giant and at the same time having its orbit decay due to bow-shock friction with the gas. Tides induce on the expanded star by the planet would also cause the orbit to decay, rather than expand as might have been expected to loss of gas from the star. These possibilities have been studied because that is the expected future of the Earth. Another hypothesis is that close-in planets could have formed during the merger of two white dwarfs.

Taking place largely in real time, the film follows a trio of payroll robbers who kidnap a young woman and force a man with a sick child to be their getaway driver, all while trying to avoid being caught by the police. An adaptation of the Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine short story \\"Man and Boy\\" by Michael J. Carroll, Rabid Dogs was a departure for Bava, as its emphasis on realism sets it apart stylistically from his colourful horror films. Following three weeks of principal photography, producer Roberto Loyola declared bankruptcy, resulting in the-then incomplete film being shelved due to his ownership of the rights. Rabid Dogs remained unseen for over two decades, but following an acquisition of the rights by Lander, it has since been released on home video in multiple versions, with various scenes being partially re- shot, added or removed for continuity. One of these versions, titled Kidnapped, was supervised by Bava's son Lamberto and his colleague Alfredo Leone. A Franco-Canadian remake of the same name, directed by √âric Hannezo, was released in 2015.  Plot  Four criminals rob a car carrying company wages. During their getaway, their car is damaged and one is killed. The remaining criminals, Doc (Maurice Poli), Blade (Aldo Caponi) and Thirty-Two (Luigi Montefiori) are forced to flee on foot into an underground car park, pursued by the police. The criminals take hostages, and when Blade accidentally kills one, the police, seeing the other hostage Maria (Lea Lander) in danger, back away, allowing the criminals to escape in her car. Doc knows that a description of their new getaway car will soon reach the authorities, so they hijack another car. The driver, Riccardo (Riccardo Cucciolla), protests he has to get his young child ‚Äì a comatose boy in a blanket ‚Äì to hospital, but the criminals force him to drive them out of the city towards their hideout. During the journey, Maria cannot stop shaking, which annoys Blade and Thirty-Two. They fondle her and Doc is barely able to restrain them. At a traffic construction site, Doc tells everyone to close their windows, attracting attention on a hot day. Doc then has them open their windows and they continue. Later, Maria asks to stop so she can relieve herself, then tries to escape. Blade and Thirty-Two chase her to an unoccupied farmhouse, recapture her, and force her to urinate in public as punishment. Later, Riccardo asks Doc if he can stop for food. Riccardo buys sandwiches and soda, while Thirty-Two buys scotch. When a woman recognizes Riccardo, he says he's going on a picnic with friends. Back on the expressway, Thirty-Two becomes intoxicated and draws attention from other motorists. Doc and Blade fail to control him and he attempts to rape Maria. Rather than risk attracting police attention, Doc shoots him. Blade is shaken but understands that Doc had no choice. Thirty-Two does not die, but becomes immobile. Riccardo tells them they need petrol. However, when they reach a filling station, the attendant (Francesco Ferrini) tells them that he is on his break and will not help them for 20 minutes. Doc, in a hurry, threatens him, but he pulls a gun, saying he was robbed the previous year and cannot be intimidated. Blade forces Maria to ask him to fill their car so they can get the boy to hospital. The attendant relents, but a young woman (Eriak Dario) shows up claiming her car had broken down and she needs assistance. She pressures Doc into giving her a ride to the next town. When she opens the side door, Thirty-Two's bloody hand appears. The woman fails to see this, but the attendant does. To avoid a scene, Doc allows her to join them. The attendant returns to his office with a shrug. The hitchhiker, also named Maria, talks constantly, annoying everyone. She is oblivious to the situation. When she inadvertently removes the blanket covering Thirty-Two', revealing the bullet wound, Blade kills her. Doc forces Riccardo to pull over so they can dispose of her. They also carry Thirty-Two out of the car, and Blade shoots his mortally wounded friend in a mercy killing. The group finally reaches the hideout: a ruined villa where Doc has stashed a back-up car, carrying papers to enable him and Blade to emigrate. Riccardo and Maria are elated, but Doc reveals he intends to kill them to secure their escape. Riccardo tries to persuade Doc to let the boy, in a sedative-induced sleep throughout, live. Doc refuses and orders Riccardo to remove him from the car. As Riccardo does so, he pulls out a gun hidden in the child's blanket and shoots both Doc and Blade, who shoots Maria dead before expiring. With the car tires flat from the bullet hits, Riccardo moves the child to Doc's getaway car, takes the stolen money, and leaves. In a final twist, it is revealed that Riccardo has a dark secret: he is a criminal who kidnapped the child and phones the child's mother to tell her to pay a ransom of six million lire and he will call back with instructions. Riccardo returns to his new car containing the child in the trunk and drives away. Style Unlike Bava's earlier films that showcased garish colors and outlandish camera angles, Rabid Dogs was described by Roberto Curti as not even looking like the work of the same director. The film starts similar to the poliziotteschi films that were growing popular in Italy in the 1970s, but lacks the sociological insights those films had. Production Actor Al Lettieri was replaced by Riccardo Cucciolla (pictured) after the first three days of shooting. By the early 1970s, Mario Bava was facing difficulties in his career. He received creative freedom to make the type of film he wanted with Lisa and the Devil (1974), which was shelved when it failed to find a distributor at the Cannes Film Market. Another of his films, A Bay of Blood (1971), was a box office disappointment in Italy. This led to him trying a new project different from anything he had done previously, and he began developing what would become Rabid Dogs under the working title L'uomo e il bambino. The film is based on \\"Man and Boy\\", a short story published in an issue of Giallo Mondadori, and the screenplay was written by Alessandro Parenzo and an uncredited Cesare Frugoni. Principal photography began in August 1973; Bava opted to shoot everything in chronological order. The film was shot on the road along the Roma-Civitavecchia motorway. Al Lettieri was hired to play Riccardo, but after arriving on the first morning of shooting intoxicated, he was fired and the role was recast three days later with Riccardo Cucciolla. Cucciolla could not speak English; according to co-star Maurice Poli, he had to read his lines in English from the script that was placed strategically around the car. Bava's son, Lamberto Bava, who was the assistant director on the film, has discussed several issues with the film's production stemming from producer Roberto Loyola. Reportedly, Loyola had financial difficulties, and the crew stopped working when their cheques were not dated in the first week. After Loyola signed them, the crew continued work to only find later that all of their cheques had bounced. Despite these problems, Bava was able to complete principal shooting in three weeks. During filming, the film's title became Ore 9 Semaforo (9 A.M. - Red Light) and later Cani Arrabbiati. All that remained to be filmed were some cutaway shots involving helicopters and police cars, and a pre-credit sequence. Loyola went bankrupt during this period, and had the production shelved. The Bavas attempted to regain possession of the film, but were unable to retrieve the rights to complete it. Release Rabid Dogs was screened in 1995 at the MIFED Film Market in Milan. This version was titled Semaforo rosso () and was developed by Lea Lander's group Spera Cinematografica with funding from German film journalist Peter Blumenstock. Lamberto Bava stated that this version was completed against his wishes and created from a rough cut of the film assembled by Carlo Reali while originally filming. This version included shot-on-video inserts to connect footage and the addition of a police siren sound at the end of the film. As the film was shot without sound, the soundtrack and dubbing had to be completely redone. This version had its premiere at the 14th Brussels International Film Festival in 1996. Home video The first DVD of the film was limited to 2000 discs from Blumenstock's label Lucertola Media in 1998. This version lost Spera's inserts and kept the original ending of the film, which was shot per Bava's script indications. The film was released again in Germany in 2001 through the Astro label. The Astro version does not contain the prologue and features a longer take of the film's ending. Following this, a fourth version was developed as a rough draft by Alfredo Leone. This version includes more video footage of missing cutaway shots, two new scenes shot on video at the end of the film and ends with a zoom-in and freeze-frame of a mother's face. A fifth version of the film was released by both Leone and Lamberto Bava, which added stock footage of 1970s police cars and new scenes shot on 35mm by Lamberto and Roy Bava between April and May 2001. This version contains new dubbing and a new music score by Stelvio Cipriani. Lamberto Bava edited this version with Mauro Bonanni, which cut parts of the film he felt Mario Bava would not have wanted. Roberto Curti has stated that among the above versions, the Astro version was the best release as the Leone/Lamberto Bava release was \\"nothing short of a mess, albeit a well-intentioned one\\". The DVD released by Anchor Bay contains the Leone and Lamberto Bava version of the film titled Kidnapped, as well as the Lucertola version. A Blu-ray of the film was released by Kino Lorber in the United States which only contains the Leone and Bava version titled Kidnapped. In the United Kingdom, Arrow Video released a Blu-ray that contained both Kidnapped and the version seen on the American Anchor Bay release. The Lucertola version on Arrow Video's Blu-ray contains parts in standard definition as no complete film print could be found after Kidnapped was created.  Critical reception  Tim Lucas, author of the critical biography Mario Bava: All the Colors of the Dark, calls the film \\"an exceptional work in the distinguished career of Mario Bava\\" and states that Rabid Dogs is to Bava's career what Detour (1945) is to the filmography of Edgar G. Ulmer, a minimalist noir masterpiece that shows how much drama he was capable of conjuring onscreen with little or no means.\\" On reviewing the Semaforo rosso version, Slant Magazine gave the film three and a half stars out of four, declaring that the \\"final plot twist so shocking that it forces the spectator to reevaluate everything that transpired prior. Quite cynically, Bava evokes a human society where no one is to be trusted\\". Reviewing the Arrow Video Blu-ray, Fangoria declared that the Semaforo rosso cut superior to Kidnapped, noting that Kidnapped \\"is still a striking film, just one that was altered from the original intent in a few unflattering ways.\\" and the Rabid Dogs was an \\"overlooked masterpiece ranks up there with [Mario Bava's] best movies.\\" Aftermath and influence Rabid Dogs was remade under the same title as the debut feature by Eric Hannezo in 2015.

It has traditionally been used to refer to a weak spot in a figurative suit of armor. The standard meaning is similar to that of Achilles' heel. Grammarist provides a sample usage by The Daily Telegraph that they find acceptable: \\"Such hype was anathema for the modest professional fighter, who has 22 victories under his belt, and not a perceptible chink in his armour.\\" Etymology The phrase \\"chink in one's armor\\" has been used idiomatically since the mid-17th century. It is based on a definition of chink meaning \\"a crack or gap,\\" dating back to around 1400. Notable controversies ESPN posted a headline using the text \\"Chink In The Armor\\" but quickly retracted it. While the phrase itself is innocuous, its use in contemporary times has caused controversy in the United States due to it including \\"chink\\", a word that can also be used as an ethnic slur to refer to someone of Chinese or East Asian descent.  ESPN  Considerable controversy was generated in the United States after two incidents regarding Asian American basketball player Jeremy Lin and the network ESPN occurred in the same week. An editor used the phrase as a headline on the company's web site in February 2012; the headline was titled \\"Chink In The Armor\\", and referred specifically to Lin. The headline was a reference to Lin's unsuccessful game against the New Orleans Hornets, suggesting that Jeremy Lin's popularity and winning streak were weakening. While ESPN has used the phrase \\"chink in the armor\\" on its website over 3,000 times before, its usage in this instance was considered offensive because it directly referred to a person of Chinese descent. Many viewed the usage of the phrase as a double entendre. Slate called it \\"a bad choice of words at best and a smirky, passive aggressive racist dig at worst\\". ESPN quickly removed the headline, apologized, and said it was conducting an internal review. The editor, Anthony Federico, denied any idiomatic usage, saying \\"This had nothing to do with me being cute or punny ... I'm so sorry that I offended people. I'm so sorry if I offended Jeremy.\\" Nevertheless, he was fired. On-air ESPN commentator Max Bretos also used the same phrase to refer to Lin, asking \\"If there is a chink in the armor, where can Lin improve his game?\\" Bretos apologized, saying \\"My wife is Asian, would never intentionally say anything to disrespect her and that community.\\" He was suspended for 30 days. Forbes believes he did so without racist intent. As a result of the controversy, a writer for Slate suggested the phrase be retired permanently. While admitting that the phrase \\"chink in the armor\\" is not inherently racist, the writer argued that any usage of the word \\"chink\\" was offensive, regardless of context. Comedy television show Saturday Night Live satirized ESPN's use of the phrase, pointing out the difference in society's reaction to racial jokes about Asian people versus racial jokes about black people. In the skit, three sports commentators were featured happily making jokes about Lin's race, while a fourth drew contempt for making similar comments about black players.  Other  A commentator on CNBC in 2013 used the phrase when referring to Rupert Murdoch's divorce of his Asian-American wife, sparking outrage. In 2015, The Wall Street Journal used the idiom in a tweet to promote an article about various difficulties China's paramount leader Xi Jinping was encountering. The organization subsequently deleted the post, stating that \\"a common idiom used might be seen as a slur. No offense was intended.\\" In October 2018, TBS baseball announcer Ron Darling, who himself is of Chinese descent, used the phrase during a Yankees-Red Sox playoff game, referring to the performance of Japanese pitcher Masahiro Tanaka and immediately received similar criticism. Darling later apologized for his unintentional choice of words.

Plot American Peter Kleist (Antonio Cantafora) arrives in Austria to take a break from college studies and look up his family's history. At the airport he is greeted by his uncle, Karl Hummel (Massimo Girotti), who invites him to stay at his house. Peter learns from Karl that his great-grandfather, Baron Otto Von Kleist, nicknamed \\"Baron Blood\\", was a notorious sadist who tortured and murdered over 100 villagers. Legend says he burned a witch named Elizabeth H√∂lle, who cursed him with a spell that would allow him to rise from the dead so she could take her revenge on him again and again. The Baron's old castle and former residence is being remodeled into a hotel for tourists. Peter persuades his uncle to take him to the castle. At the castle, they meet Herr Dortmund (Dieter Tressler), the entrepreneur responsible for the hotel project, and Eva (Elke Sommer), a former college student of Karl, whose job is to ensure Dortmundt does not make any lasting changes to the castle's architecture. After a tour of the castle, Karl invites Eva to his house for dinner. During the meal, Peter brings up the subject of Baron Von Kleist. Gretchen (Nicoletta Elmi), Karl's young daughter, claims to have seen the Baron in the woods near the castle, but nobody listens to her. Peter produces an ancient document he found at his grandfather's house back in America. It is an incantation which, if read in the castle bell tower at midnight, will supposedly bring the Baron back to life. Against Karl's warnings, Peter and Eva go to the castle and read the incantation. Although it is midnight, the bell tolls two o'clock, the same time Baron Von Kleist was murdered. Heavy footsteps approach from outside. Eva implores Peter to recant the incantation, using the alternate spell on the same document. But a gust of wind blows the parchment into a fireplace. Peter goes outside to investigate, but there is no one there. In the woods surrounding the castle, the Baron emerges from his grave and visits a doctor's office. The doctor (Gustavo De Nardo) dresses his wounds. When the doctor insists on calling an ambulance, the Baron grabs a scalpel and stabs him to death. The next morning, Peter and Eva admit what they've done. Karl insists they are imagining things and tells them to forget about it. The Baron secretly enters his castle and kills Dortmundt, hanging him from the castle ceiling. When the body is found by Fritz (Luciano Pigozzi), the caretaker of the castle, the Baron kills him. With Dortmundt dead, the plans for restoring the castle fall through and the property goes up for auction. The next day, the castle is purchased by Alfred Becker (Joseph Cotten), a millionaire who uses a wheelchair. He offers Eva a job in assisting him to restore the castle to its original condition. She gladly accepts. Later, Eva is attacked in one of the castle corridors by the Baron. She is saved by the intrusion of Peter. Eva quits her job and decides to make a fresh start elsewhere. That evening, Eva returns to her apartment in town, only to find the Baron waiting for her. She escapes through a window and seeks shelter at Karl's home. Finally convinced that the Baron is alive, Karl agrees to help Eva and Peter find a way to destroy him. They visit Christina (Rada Rassimov), a local medium, who conjures H√∂lle's spirit from the netherworld for information about the Baron. Christina gives them a magic amulet and tells them that the ones who raised the Baron are the only ones who can destroy him. Because of this, he will do everything in his power to kill Peter and Eva. After Peter, Eva and Karl leave, Christina is killed by the Baron. On her way home from school, Gretchen is terrorized by the Baron, who chases her though the woods. Returning to the castle, Gretchen meets Becker for the first time. She tells her father that Becker is the Baron; she recognizes his eyes. Karl, Peter and Eva confront Becker. He shows them the restored castle, complete with dummies impaled on stakes. Becker rises from his wheelchair and knocks out Peter, Karl, and Eva. He then takes them to his torture chamber. When Eva wakes up, she is tied to a chair and sees Fritz's dead body in the open spike- lined coffin beside her. Becker ties up Karl to a rack, while he tortures Peter with red-hot pokers. As Eva struggles to untie herself, she accidentally drops the amulet onto Fritz's body. A few drops of Eva's blood from her wounds land on Fritz's body and the amulet. The secret of how to destroy the Baron comes to light: the Baron's victims all rise from their coffins, empowered by the magic amulet and the blood of the ones who raised him. The undead victims attack the Baron and rip him apart. Eva unties Peter and Karl, and the trio flee from the castle, while the Baron's dying screams and H√∂lle's laughter echo into the night air.

Production Baron Blood originated as a screenplay written by Vincent G. Fotre, a professional tennis player who dabbled in writing movies. The screenplay was acquired by independent producer Jerry Briskin, who showed it to Alfredo Leone in hopes he would be interested in co-producing it. Leone greatly liked the script and saw it as an opportunity to work with director Mario Bava again after their first collaboration, Four Times That Night, had turned out disastrously. Leone had turned down an offer from Bava to produce Hatchet for the Honeymoon, but felt Baron Blood to be a more appropriate vehicle for Bava. When Briskin proved unable to meet his end of the production deal, Leone took on sole control of the project. Bava initially turned down Leone's offer because one of the production associates had set the condition that the movie be filmed in one or more of the castles located in Vienna, and he was resolved to remain in Italy. However, with his career on the wane, he ultimately became resigned that a better offer than Baron Blood was unlikely to come along in the foreseeable future. Baron Blood marked the return of Bava to the horror genre, six years after Kill, Baby... Kill!. Leone handled the casting, though Nicoletta Elmi, who had appeared in Bava's earlier film Twitch of the Death Nerve, was cast at Bava's request. The film began shooting in 1971, which included location work at the Austrian castle Burg Kreuzenstein. According to Leone, Bava was so excited by the castle's filming possibilities that when Leone told him he had secured the deal to use the castle, Bava embraced and kissed him. The film's credited cinematographer is Antonio Rinaldi, although producer Alfredo Leone stated that Bava took over cinematography for the film, with Rinaldi handling the second unit shots. To satisfy a distributor's agreement, most of the film's violent scenes were filmed twice, one for theatrical release and one for television, with the violence being toned down in the television version. One week into filming, Baron Blood faced a financial crisis as the Bank of America cancelled their agreement to discount Leone's letter of credit in response to the Nixon shock. To solve the issue, Leone flew to New York to secure funding of $125,000 from J. Arthur Elliot and Sam Lang. Despite the film's complicated and contradicting writing credits across different countries, Leone has maintained that the script is almost entirely Fotre's work; Mario Bava and William Bairn's contributions were minimal, while \\"Wilibald Eser\\" is a fictional person presumably credited to satisfy the Italian/German co-production agreement. Release Baron Blood was released in Italy, where it was distributed by Jumbo Cinematografica, on 25 February 1972. The film grossed a total of 269,812,000 Italian lire, which Italian film historian Roberto Curti described as \\"mediocre\\". Baron Blood was acquired for release in the United States by American International Pictures, which cut the film by ten minutes and replaced Stelvio Cipriani's score with one by Les Baxter. The American print of the film also credits the screenplay to Vincent Fotre and William A. Baron. It was an international box office success, particularly in the U.S., owing to which producer Alfredo Leone offered Bava a contract for a new film (Lisa and the Devil) and granted him total artistic control on it.  Critical reception  In contemporary reviews, Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, writing, \\"sometimes you can enjoy horror movies because they're so bad, but Baron Blood isn't bad enough.\\" A.H. Weiler from The New York Times gave the film a negative review, calling the title villain \\"bland\\" and stating: \\"Under Mario Bava's pedestrian direction, the concocted creaking, screaming, gory murders and Miss Sommer's frightened racing through dark passageways largely add up to spectral schlock\\". From retrospective reviews, film critic Leonard Maltin gave the movie 2.5 stars, briefly noting \\"standard plot is livened by unusual settings and lighting\\". Daryl Loomis from DVD Verdict gave the film a mostly positive review, stating: \\"Baron Blood is not Mario Bava's best film, but it's far from his worst. It's bloody and full of torture, if not so full of suspense, but it's still a lot of fun.\\" Dread Central awarded the film a score of 3 out of 5, commenting: \\"Baron Blood [is] a particularly uneven piece of work; yet, Bava‚Äôs eye is consistently impressive, creating swathes of Gothic imagery such as a chase sequence through fog-laden streets, sterling use of shadow in framing his antagonist, and a great location in the form of the Baron‚Äôs castle. To be expected is also the director‚Äôs excellent use of lighting and primary colours, making this another rich visual experience with that distinctly European feel. While it certainly isn‚Äôt anywhere near the upper echelons of Bava‚Äôs filmography, it offers enough in the way of style and the gleefully macabre to keep it afloat\\". The film currently has a 14% approval rating on movie review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on seven reviews.  In popular culture  The Well to Hell hoax is an urban legend that circulated on the internet and in American tabloids in the late 1990s. The hoax was that a borehole in Russia was purportedly drilled so deep that it broke through into Hell, and that seismologists in Siberia recorded sounds in the nine-mile deep pit that included yells and haunting screams for help from sinners supposedly sent to Hell. The recording, however, was later revealed to have been a cleverly remixed portion of the soundtrack of Baron Blood, with various effects added.

Jones divorced his first wife, Julie McMahon, in 2009. In July 2011, Jones wedded Courtney Perry in a religious marriage, but not legally by the laws of Minnesota or the United States in solidarity with non-heterosexual couples who could not wed: \\"It was for this reason that Courtney and I decided to forego legal marriage until such time as our GLBT friends were afforded all of the benefits that accrue with a legal marriage.\\" Twenty-eight months later, they were scheduled to legally wed at the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden on November 11, 2013. Career While attending Fuller Theological, Jones returned to his childhood church--Colonial Church in Edina--and worked there as a youth pastor for seven years before leaving for his doctoral work at Princeton. As a spokesperson with the emerging church movement, Jones was invited by a similar Jewish organization, Synagogue 3000, to speak at their 2006 meeting.

The airport is located on a site, of which is occupied by the current facilities. Further growth and expansion of the airport is limited by urban encroachment as much of the surrounding land has been developed into residential estates. The airport has been managed by Sunshine Coast Airports, a business unit of the Sunshine Coast Regional Council which is also responsible for the operations of the Sunshine Coast Airport at Maroochydore since 2008. History Early aircraft operations in the Caloundra area used the sandy beaches for takeoffs and landings; however, as early as 1927, community groups were calling for the construction of an airport. The current site was reserved as a landing ground in 1931. The modern airport facilities were built by the now defunct Landsborough Shire Council and were officially opened on 19 August 1972 by Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. New hangar facilities were constructed on airport land to accommodate the Queensland Air Museum in the 1980s. Operations The airport is home to 19 businesses, providing 220 jobs for the local area. As well as aviation related services, the airport offers tourist attractions including skydiving, scenic flights and a museum. Several companies offer flight training for general aviation and recreational pilots including Inspire Aviation, GoFly Aviation and Airways Aviation Academy. The Queensland Institute for Aviation Engineering's main campus has been located at the airport since 2000. The institute is an internationally accredited training provider for aircraft maintenance and engineering students. Caloundra is one of two bases for Airways Aviation (formerly Chopperline Flight Training) (The other being Gold Coast Airport), a provider of flight training, maintenance and corporate charter services for helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. Airways Aviation also contribute to local tourism offering scenic flights and corporate transfers from the airport. The Queensland Air Museum was established in 1973, moving to a permanent facility at Caloundra Airport on 14 June 1986 at the invitation of the Landsborough Shire Council. The museum is a tourist drawcard for the area, and since moving to Caloundra the collection has grown from five to over forty aircraft on display. Major exhibits include a GAF Canberra bomber, a DHC-4 Caribou as well as many smaller military and civilian types significant to aviation in Queensland. The museum now has a F-111C following the retirement of the aircraft from active service with the RAAF. Airport facilities Caloundra airport has two sealed runways, . Only one runway is equipped with Pilot Controlled Lighting which can be turned on and off by radio as required. Fuel and aircraft maintenance facilities are available. There is no control tower and pilots are required to co-ordinate aircraft movements using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). Circuit training for student pilots in not permitted after 2100 hours on weekdays and after last light on weekends as the airport is in a noise sensitive area. The nearest navigation aid for aircraft is the Maroochydore VOR installation to the north. Currently there are no airlines serving Caloundra and there are no plans for regular passenger flights in the immediate future. Future On 19 August 2010, Sunshine Coast council voted to retain Caloundra Airport in the current location. Both council and the Queensland Government had proposed relocating the airport to allow the land to be sold and redeveloped. A report to council recommended the creation of a master plan, environmental and business strategy to secure the long-term future of the facility. Following this decision, consultation with aviation businesses and the release of a preliminary master plan called for a extension of runway 05/23 and expanded facilities for general aviation businesses. In September 2011, however, the state government approved a new housing estate at Caloundra South which will see new homes are built directly under the flight path for the airport, as close as from the runways. This has led to a delay in the tender process for leases at the site, and renewed uncertainty for businesses over their future tenure at Caloundra Airport. Accidents and incidents * On 2 September 1990, a Jodel D11 aircraft, registration VH-FTY crashed into a swamp shortly after takeoff from Caloundra. The aircraft was destroyed by post-impact fire; however, the two occupants survived the crash with serious injuries. The pilot reported the engine lost power during the initial climb. * On 15 August 2004, a Mooney M20 aircraft, registration VH-DXZ crashed into the ocean off Bokarina while approaching Caloundra Airport at night. The wreckage was not located for 13 days following the accident, which killed the pilot. A subsequent investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau cited spatial disorientation and a lack of visual reference while over water in darkness as contributing factors in the crash. * On 12 August 2017 a small private aircraft crashed and flipped on the runway. Four people were injured with two taken to hospital in a serious condition. It is believed that the aircraft stalled, flipped and came to a halt upside-down above the runway.

In particular, Mortal Kombat has often been criticised from a broad spectrum of politicians and other critics for its unrestrained use of graphic and bloody violence (both in the game's regular combat scenes and its Fatalities‚Äîfinishing moves which allow the player to kill or otherwise maim opponent characters). The violent nature of the series, one of the earliest of its kind, has led to the creation and continued presence of the Entertainment Software Rating Board and other ratings boards for video games. Various Mortal Kombat games have been censored or banned in several countries, and the franchise was the subject of several court cases. In Germany, every Mortal Kombat game was banned for ten years from its release until 2015. Mortal Kombat (2011) is also banned in Brazil and South Korea, and has been banned in Australia until February 2013. MK11 is banned in Indonesia, Japan, China and Ukraine. Controversies and censorship The Mortal Kombat series' violence, particularly its \\"Fatalities\\", was a source of major controversy in late 1992 and 1993. A moral panic over the series, fueled by outrage from the mass media, resulted in a Congressional hearing and helped to pave the way for the creation of the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) game rating system in 1994. In 2010, Mortal Kombat co-creator and long-time producer Ed Boon revealed that he had actually sympathised with much of the outrage and admitted, \\"I wouldn't want my ten-year-old kid playing a game like that.\\" Congressional hearing and response During the U.S. Congressional hearing on video game violence, Democratic Party Senator Herb Kohl, working with Senator Joe Lieberman, attempted to illustrate why government regulation of video games was needed by showing clips from 1992's Mortal Kombat and Night Trap (another game featuring digitized actors).Steve Kent, The Ultimate History of Video Games. Brought in as an expert, Professor Eugene F. Provenzo commented that such games \\"have almost TV-quality graphics [but] are overwhelmingly violent, sexist and racist.\\"Karen J. Cohen, States News Service, \\"Kohl still wants video games bill\\". The Milwaukee Sentinel, December 10, 1993. Nintendo, which had a policy of screening games for content like blood, had refused to allow gore in Mortal Kombat's release for their home system. Meanwhile, their rival, Sega, released the game with their MA-13 rating, resulting in a great commercial success for them when millions of consumers chose their version over Nintendo's.Kevin C. Pyle, Scott Cunningham, Bad for You: Exposing the War on Fun!, page 63. Nintendo's representatives attempted to use that fact to attack Sega during the hearings. In response to these developments, Sega's Spanish division cancelled the release of their version of Mortal Kombat in Spain, fearing the game would stir up as much controversy there as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. Lieberman had been one of the first politicians to voice concerns over Mortal Kombat in 1993, and continued to be one of the most avid critics of violent video games. He later referenced the series and DOOM in a 1996 statement, when he joined Kohl and the psychologist David Walsh in a campaign to inform Congress about the new wave of violent games such as Resident Evil.Claire Bond Potter, Renee Christine Romano, Doing Recent History: On Privacy, Copyright, Video Games, Institutional Review Boards, Activist Scholarship, and History that Talks Back, page 209. Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias recalled having been \\"pretty pissed off\\" about that because of how he felt \\"the folks like Lieberman\\" have been \\"trivializing real problems with their video game nonsense.\\" During the 2000s, however, the controversy surrounding the series had wound down significantly. In 2006, AP writer Lou Kesten wrote that while Lieberman had remained \\"one of the video game industry's most persistent critic[s,] Mortal Kombat is no longer the flashpoint of the game violence debate. Its brand of mano-a-mano brawling is seen as kind of old-fashioned today, now that the likes of Grand Theft Auto are serving up the indiscrimate slaughter of innocent civilians.\\"Lou Kesten, the Associated Press. \\"Blood and guts a video game standby.\\" Park City Daily News, October 26, 2006. TIME commented in 2012 that \\"the reason the 1992 classic remains seminal is because it broke an implicit taboo about what was okay to put in a game.\\" Game ratings, bans and censorship As with the first Mortal Kombat game, the extremely bloody content of Mortal Kombat II became the subject of a great deal of controversy regarding violent video games. In 1994, Mortal Kombat II was added to the index of works deemed harmful to young people by Germany's Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons. The next year, all versions of the game, except for Game Boy's, were confiscated from the German market for violating ¬ß131 of the country's penal code, which prohibited showing gruesome violence against humans (the ban ended in 2005, due to the ten-year limitation for confiscations). Mortal Kombat II has been censored in its original release in Japan, where Nintendo insisted on changing the blood shown in the game from red to green, as well as making the screen turn black- and-white for all character-specific lethal Fatality moves.EGM2 5 (November 1994), page 96. The backlash that Nintendo of America had received for their own similar censorship of the first Mortal Kombat, however, informed the company's future business practices, and so the sequel and following games in the series were released by them uncensored. In 2009, Mortal Kombat developer and publisher Midway Games was forced to tone down the Joker's finishing move to secure the ESRB T-rating for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. In 2010, Swiss Social Democrat politician Evi Allemann unsuccessfully campaigned to outlaw Mortal Kombat, Manhunt, and video games displaying interactive \\"cruel acts of violence\\" in Switzerland. The series' 2011 reboot game Mortal Kombat has been banned by law in a number of countries, including entirely in Australia and South Korea, and partially in Germany (prohibiting any sort of advertising and public exposure). The Australian Minister for Home Affairs, Brendan O'Connor, asked to be briefed on the decision, citing \\"public disquiet on the issue,\\" and the game was eventually allowed in the country in 2013 when the R18+ rating came into effect. Due to stated reason of the inconsistency of the game with the local legislations, the previously planned regional releases of 2019's Mortal Kombat 11 have been canceled in Indonesia, Japan, and Ukraine (in Ukraine because of laws banning Nazi and Communist symbols, in Indonesia because of laws regarding Communist symbols). The game is also unavailable in the People's Republic of China. Legislation The Australian Senate had set up an inquiry in response to the original Mortal Kombat, Time Killers, and Night Trap, and the surrounding media coverage; the Senate's inquiry led to the Commonwealth Classification Act, which came into force on March 1, 1995, and introduced the Australian Classification Board. Almost exactly 18 years later, the Board finally banned the 2011 Mortal Kombat game for its \\"explicit depictions of dismemberment, decapitation, disembowelment and other brutal forms of slaughter.\\"It took 18 years, but Mortal Kombat's finally banned, news.com.au, March 2, 2011. The game's publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive, appealed, but the appeal was rejected. However, following the introduction of an adults-only rating system in 2013, the ban was overturned in Australia and the game re-rated R18+ uncensored.Mark Serrels, Mortal Kombat Finally Receives An R18+ Classification In Australia, Kotaku Australia, February 14, 2012. In 1998, the Florida House of Representatives' Barry Silver sponsored a bill to regulate video game violence, which he stated \\"[has] affected the moral fiber of our youth.\\" The bill's initial proponents included Florida's Democratic Governor, Lawton Chiles (who alleged that violent video games can become \\"an instruction manual for murder and mayhem\\"The Associated Press, \\"Chiles looks to restrict violent video games\\". Boca Raton News, April 3, 1998.) and Florida State University Professor Murray Krantz, a specialist in child development. Eventually, the bill garnered support from more than 50 lawmakers and various groups ranging from the Florida Parent-Teacher Association to the Christian Coalition of America. After seeing a videotape of gameplay from one of the Mortal Kombat games, the House Governmental Rules and Regulation Committee passed the bill unanimously. Opponents, such as the Interactive Digital Software Association's founder and president, Doug Lowenstein, regarded the bill as unconstitutional, violating the First Amendment's freedom of speech provision with potentially far-reaching consequences. In 2002, U.S. District Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr. decided that video games are not speech at all and thus do not deserve First Amendment protection. Limbaugh based his opinion in part on his review of four games including Mortal Kombat, misnamed in court documents as \\"Mortal Combat\\". In 2005, California passed a statewide ban on selling violent video games to minors, proposed and championed by former Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, the ban was eventually struck down by a 7-2 vote in the Supreme Court case Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association in 2011. The Court ruled that \\"video games qualify for First Amendment protection,\\" making the ban unconstitutional. The Justices' majority opinion declared: \\"Reading Dante is unquestionably more cultured and intellectually edifying than playing Mortal Kombat. But these cultural and intellectual differences are not constitutional ones. Crudely violent video games, tawdry TV shows, and cheap novels and magazines are no less forms of speech than The Divine Comedy, and restrictions upon them must survive strict scrutiny.\\" Justice Elena Kagan was quoted as calling Mortal Kombat \\"an iconic game, which I am sure half of the clerks who work for us spent considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing.\\" Advertisement censorship Mortal Kombats advertisements received criticism as well. In 1993, Senator Lieberman, referencing one of Sega's television commercials for the game, argued that the ad itself too promoted violence. Some advertisements were subjected to censorship. The 2011 edition of Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition awarded the Mortal Kombat series the world record for the earliest video game poster to be censored: \\"On April 22, 2003, Britain's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) took the then unprecedented step of condemning the poster campaign promoting Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance.\\" The ASA claimed that the poster, showing a hoodie with a bloodstained hand, was \\"irresponsible\\" and \\"condoned violence\\"; the poster was removed. Blood on the Carpet, a TV commercial for 2005's Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks created by London-based company Maverick Media, was also targeted by the ASA as \\"condoning and glorifying violence\\". Studies on video game violence *In 2000, psychologists Craig A. Anderson and Karen Dill conducted two related studies on the effects of media violence. The studies involved notably violent games, including Mortal Kombat and Wolfenstein 3D. They concluded that playing such games makes players, especially males, act more aggressively. Following the studies' publication, a year-long \\"flurry of new scrutiny\\" was directed at Mortal Kombat by U.S. lawmakers and the media.\\"Violent video games are drawing fire from many lawmakers.\\" The Southeast Missourian, July 19, 2004. *A 2008 experiment by Richard J. Barlett, Christopher P. Harris, and Callie Bruey also examined how playing Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance affected subjects' hostility and heart rate. They interpreted their findings as evidence that players exhibited \\"more aggressive thoughts activated in semantic memory.\\" *In a 2010 experiment conducted by psychologists Brad Bushman and Bryan Gibson, using Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe and two other violent games (Resistance: Fall of Man and Resident Evil 5), the authors concluded \\"that the aggression stimulating effects of a violent video game can persist long after the game has been turned off, if people ruminate about the violent content in the game.\\" *The following year, Dr. Brock Bastian from the University of Queensland's School of Psychology performed an experiment in which participants played Mortal Kombat, fighting against each other and against artificial intelligence-controlled opponents. The study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, claimed to have \\"found evidence that playing violent video games leads players to see themselves, and their opponents, as lacking in core human qualities such as warmth, open-mindedness, and intelligence.\\" Bastian concluded that \\"the findings of this study point to the potential long-term effects of violent video game play and suggest that repeated exposure to these dehumanising experiences may result in chronic changes in self-perception.\\" *Bruce D. Bartholow, a psychology professor at the University of Missouri, said that there is a fear that this simulated violence can translate into real-life violence as \\"the extent that a player learns to make specific or violent responses in the context of the game, those same skills could transfer to similar scenarios outside the game, potentially increasing aggression in nongaming situations.\\"Craig Johnson, \\"'Mortal Kombat' is back, but this time (some) fans cringe\\", HLN, July 15, 2014. Real-life violence In the aftermath of the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, the subjects of DOOM and Mortal Kombat returned to Congressional hearings about the alleged impact on children. United States President Bill Clinton stated that \\"video games like Mortal Kombat, Killer Instinct, and DOOM, the very game played obsessively by the two young men who ended so many lives in Littleton, make our children more active participants in simulated violence.\\" Attorney Jack Thompson, a Christian conservative activist against sexual themes and violence in video games and other entertainment media, represented the families of three of the Columbine victims in unsuccessfully trying to sue the producers of DOOM and Mortal Kombat.John Shelton Lawrence, Robert Jewett, The Myth of the American Superhero, page 202. Some critics have alleged that the Mortal Kombat series influenced particular cases of real-life lethal violence other than the Columbine massacre: *In 1999, Brazil banned Mortal Kombat, Postal, Carmageddon, and four first-person shooter games for allegedly inspiring twenty-four-year-old medical student Mateus da Costa Meira's deadly shooting rampage at Morumbi Shopping in S√£o Paulo, which was primarily blamed on Duke Nukem 3D. *In 2007, twenty-year-old Patrick Morris used a shotgun to kill fifteen-year-old Diego Aguilar in Klamath Falls, Oregon, in what prosecutors alleged was a drug deal-related killing. However, Morris' defense attorney alleged that violent video games such as Mortal Kombat \\"may have blurred Morris' ability to distinguish reality and the consequences of his actions.\\" *In 2008, in the so-called \\"Mortal Kombat murder\\" case, seventeen- year-old Lamar Roberts and sixteen-year-old Heather Trujillo were accused of fatally beating Trujillo's seven-year-old half-sister, Zoe Garcia. The pair told investigators they were acting out moves from a Mortal Kombat game. At a preliminary hearing, prosecutor Robert Miller stated: \\"Zoe Garcia was the object of abuse by both Heather Trujillo and Lamar Roberts caused these injuries with .\\" Roberts and Trujillo were convicted of murder. The victim's parents said they were convinced the Mortal Kombat story was fabricated by the killers. *In the aftermath of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Wayne LaPierre, Executive Vice President of the National Rifle Association (NRA), named four violent video games, including Mortal Kombat, as contributors to the increased incidence of killing sprees in the United States.Paul Tassi, NRA Press Conference: Blame Video Games and Movies, Not Guns, Forbes.com, 12/21/2012. Many commentators regarded LaPierre's choice of Mortal Kombat as an odd and outdated pop culture reference. *In 2015, CNN's Ashleigh Banfield described the Charleston church shooting as \\"Mortal Kombat murders\\". Feminist and racial perspectives Some critics have condemned the Mortal Kombat series as sexist and/or racist, especially regarding its many Asian characters. Guy Aoki, the president of the advocacy group Media Action Network for Asian Americans, rebuked Mortal Kombat II in 1994 for allegedly perpetuating existing stereotypes of Asians as martial arts experts, with the game's portrayal of characters such as Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Raiden, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Li Mei, and Sub-Zero. Allyne Mills, publicist for the game's publisher Acclaim Entertainment, answered: \\"This is a fantasy game, with all different characters. This is a martial arts game which comes from Asia. The game was not created to foster stereotypes.\\"May Lam, \\"Do Fighting Video Games Prolong Stereotypes of Asian Americans?\\" AsianWeek, September 23, 1994. The characters' racial diversity and the inclusion of female characters were also criticized by the psychologists Patricia Marks Greenfield and Rodney R. Cocking in their 1996 book Interacting with Video, writing they \\"cannot assume that this greater diversity represents a more progressive identity politics, for one could argue that it merely increases the racist and sexist potential of the individual fights.\\" In 1995, critical studies professor Marsha Kinder denounced Mortal Kombat II and Mortal Kombat 3 for allegedly allowing players to have what she termed \\"a misogynist aspect to the combat.\\" In a 1999 book titled From Barbie to Mortal Kombat, written by media scholars Justine Cassell and Henry Jenkins, the series was used to represent \\"the basic boy cyberworld of aggression, action and dead bodies.\\" Critics alleging the Mortal Kombat series being sexist and incompatible with women included liberal journalist Ellen Goodman, among others. On the other hand, U.S. Appeals Court Judge Richard Posner considered Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 to be \\"a feminist violent video game\\". Finding that Indianapolis' attempt to ban Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 violated the First Amendment, Judge Posner wrote \\"the game is feminist in depicting a woman as fully capable of holding her own in violent combat with heavily armed men. It thus has a message, even an 'ideology' just as books and movies do.\\" Judge Posner further marveled that \\"the woman wins all the duels. She is as strong as the men, she is more skillful, more determined, and she does not flinch at the sight of blood.\\"American Amusement Machine Ass'n v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001). Harm to game developers In 2019, Mortal Kombat 11 developers were diagnosed with PTSD after spending long time working with the violent visuals used in the video game, with a worker avoiding sleeping due to having violent dreams during sleeps. The development company was also criticized for lacking formal process, standard procedure, or guidance available for workers who needed to step back from the violent content, or felt such work had begun to negatively affect them.I'd Have These Extremely Graphic Dreams': What It's Like To Work On Ultra-Violent Games Like Mortal Kombat 11 Court cases=Daniel Pesina v. Midway Manufacturing Co. In 1996, actor Daniel Pesina (who had portrayed Johnny Cage, Sub-Zero, Scorpion, Reptile, Smoke and Noob Saibot in the first two games) sued Midway Games, Williams Electronics Games, Acclaim Entertainment, Nintendo, and Sega. He alleged \\"that all defendants used his persona, name, and likeness without authorization in the home version of Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II and the related products.\\" The case was tried in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois with Judge Elaine E. Bucklo presiding. The court concluded that \\"alleged use of martial artist's name, likeness or persona in a martial arts video game did not violate his common-law right of publicity.\\" Philip Ahn, Elizabeth Malecki, and Katalin Zamiar v. Midway Manufacturing, et al. In 1997, Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat II actors Philip Ahn (Shang Tsung), Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), and Katalin Zamiar (Kitana, Mileena, and Jade) jointly sued Midway Games, Williams Electronics Games, Acclaim, Nintendo and Sega for using their likenesses in an unauthorized way. They sought \\"a constructive trust on all monies defendants received and continued to receive from their alleged breach of their duties to [the] plaintiffs.\\" Ahn, Zamiar, and Malecki alleged \\"that they were only modeling for the coin-operated video game, not the subsequent home video, home computer, and hand-held versions of the game.\\" With Judge Robert William Gettleman presiding in the Northern District of Illinois Court \\"the plaintiffs lost on all counts because they had all consented to the videotaping and because the choreography and choice of movements used in the game were not jointly 'authored' by the individuals.\\" Wilson v. Midway Games, Inc. In 1997, thirteen-year-old Noah Wilson was killed by Yancy Salazar, also thirteen. Salazar stabbed Wilson in the chest with a kitchen knife and severed his aorta, leaving Wilson to die after an hour of massive blood loss. The victim's mother, Andrea Wilson, alleged that her son was killed due to Salazar's strong interest in Mortal Kombat. She claimed that Salazar was so \\"obsessed\\" with the game that he thought he was actually the Mortal Kombat character Cyrax, who she claimed used a Fatality in which he grabs the opponent in a headlock and stabs his opponent in the chest. In fact, this Fatality did not exist and was never performed by the character Cyrax. With Judge Janet Bond Arterton presiding, the case was tried in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The Court ruled that \\"Wilson's complaint fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\\" Royalties lawsuits related to Time Warner's 2009 Acquisition of Midway assets In 2009, Lawrence Kasanoff, producer of the Mortal Kombat films, TV series, soundtracks, and live tour, and his company, Threshold Entertainment, sued Midway in bankruptcy court over what he claimed were his own intellectual property (IP) parts of the franchise. Trying to preserve copyrights to certain Mortal Kombat characters and to retain the right to create derivative film and television projects based on the franchise, Kasanoff attempted to block a $33-million bid for Mortal Kombat assets by Time Warner, whose New Line Cinema developed the 1990s film adaptations of the games. Two other lawsuits related to millions of dollars of unpaid royalties were filed during the periods of 2000-2004 and 2005-2008. In 2011, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Ronald M. Sohigian awarded Kasanoff only $14,981 and dismissed his other claims. He also ordered Threshold to pay Time Warner, Inc. $25,412 in legal fees after determining that Time Warner, Inc. was the \\"prevailing party.\\" Kasanoff appealed the ruling and the denial of a jury trial.

Szymanowski was greatly influenced by German culture and the symphony has many echoes of Richard Strauss and Max Reger. This symphony introduced Szymanowski to Europe in 1911-12 and it was heard in Berlin, Leipzig and Vienna. The symphony was published soon after the composer's death after much revision. This symphony and its use of a solo violin laid the foundation, so to speak, of Szymanowski's first Violin Concerto. A typical performance of the symphony lasts about 30 minutes.Palmer, Christopher (CD booklet insert: Szymanowki-Symphonies Nos. 2 & 3; Bartok-Two Pictures, Detroit Symphony Orchestra conducted by Antal Dorati, Decca, Catalogue# 425625-2)International Music Score Library Project (imslp.org)  Form  The symphony is supposed to show off the composer's prowess as a contrapuntalist. The work unconventional for its time, is in two movements and begins in a typical Szymanowski manner (also with a similarity to Scriabin) with a violin solo: 1\\\\. Allegro moderato ‚Äî Grazioso :The first movement in B flat major has a passionate character to it. 2\\\\. Tema ‚Äî Variazioni ‚Äî Fuga :The second movement in which Reger is explicitly invoked, is almost a self-contained movement with its own introduction. It consists of a theme and five variations. It is playful, festive and dance-like. The Scherzo itself is a three-part structure based not only on the variation theme but also on the 1st movement's solo violin theme. The movement ends with a sixth variation followed by a fugue. Its model is probably the fugal finale of Strauss' Sinfonia domestica. Each subject in the fugue proves to be derived from earlier themes.  Instrumentation  Szymanowski scored his symphony for a large orchestra consisting of standard instruments: ;Woodwind :3 Flutes :3 Oboes or :(2 Oboes and 1 Cor anglais) :2 Clarinets in B :1 B and 1 E Clarinet or :(1 Bass Clarinet) :3 Bassoons ;Brass :4 Horns in F :3 Trumpets in B :3 Trombones :Tuba ;Percussion :Perc(3) :Harp ;Strings :1st and 2nd Violins :Violas :Cellos :Contra basses Evaluation Conductor Antoni Wit deems the symphony a very challenging work, explaining that when he is asked to conduct it he replies that the orchestra won't have it easy and the performance will require more work than usual and each musician to prepare its part before the rehearsals, but that nevertheless it will be worth it.Antoni Wit: \\"Creo que cada vez lo hago un poco mejor\\".

It is characterized by a resistance or complete insensitivity to the effects of follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH), a gonadotropin which is normally responsible for the stimulation of estrogen production by the ovaries in females and maintenance of fertility in both sexes. The condition manifests itself as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (decreased or lack of production of sex steroids by the gonads despite high circulating levels of gonadotropins), reduced or absent puberty (lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, resulting in sexual infantilism if left untreated), amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), and infertility in females, whereas males present merely with varying degrees of infertility and associated symptoms (e.g., decreased sperm production). A related condition is luteinizing hormone (LH) insensitivity (termed Leydig cell hypoplasia when it occurs in males), which presents with similar symptoms to those of FSH insensitivity but with the symptoms in the respective sexes reversed (i.e., hypogonadism and sexual infantilism in males and merely problems with fertility in females); however, males also present with feminized or ambiguous genitalia (also known as pseudohermaphroditism), whereas ambiguous genitalia does not occur in females with FSH insensitivity. Despite their similar causes, LH insensitivity is considerably more common in comparison to FSH insensitivity. Signs and symptoms In females, FSH insensitivity results in diminished development of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells and low to normal estrogen levels, elevated to very elevated gonadotropin levels, and low inhibin B levels, whereas males present with diminished Sertoli cell proliferation and moderately elevated FSH levels, normal to slightly elevated LH levels, normal testosterone levels, and reduced inhibin B levels. Due in part to elevated LH levels, which stimulate androgen production by theca cells in the ovaries, and due in part to FSH insensitivity, resulting in a lack of aromatase in nearby granulosa cells that normally convert androgens into estrogens, it could be expected that females with FSH insensitivity might present with symptoms of hyperandrogenism at puberty. However, this has not been found to be the case. This may be in part because FSH, via stimulation of granulosa cells and the resultant secretion of yet-unidentified paracrine factors (but possibly including inhibin B), has been shown to significantly enhance the LH-mediated stimulation of androgen production by theca cells. In addition, theca cells predominantly secrete the relatively weak androgen androstenedione, whereas granulosa cells, signaled to do so by FSH under normal circumstances, convert androstenedione into its more potent relative testosterone (which is subsequently converted into estradiol). Hence, in females, FSH insensitivity may not only result in deficiencies in estrogen production by granulosa cells, but in diminished androgen synthesis by both theca and granulosa cells as well, which could potentially explain why hyperandrogenism does not occur. FSH insensitivity presents itself in females as two clusters of symptoms: 1) hypergonadotropic hypogonadism or hypoestrogenism, resulting in a delayed, reduced, or fully absent puberty and associated sexual infantilism (if left untreated), reduced uterine volume, and osteoporosis; and 2) ovarian dysgenesis or failure, resulting in primary or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, and normal sized to slightly enlarged ovaries. Males on the other hand are significantly less affected, presenting merely with partial or complete infertility, reduced testicular volume, and oligozoospermia (reduced spermatogenesis). Cause FSH insensitivity is caused by inactivating mutations of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) and thus an insensitivity of the receptor to FSH. This results in an inability of the granulosa cells in ovarian follicles to respond to FSH in females, in turn resulting in diminished estrogen production by the ovaries and loss of menstrual cycles, and an inability of Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testicles to respond to FSH in males, which in turn results in impaired spermatogenesis. DiagnosisTreatment Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen may be used to treat symptoms of hypoestrogenism in females with the condition. There are currently no known treatments for the infertility caused by the condition in either sex.

The band released their second album White Orchid in April 2013.Label: GAEA Records History The band's original line-up featured Johannes Lepp√§nen (guitar, vocals), Joni K√§hk√∂nen (guitar, vocals), Mikael Jurmu (bass, vocals), Santtu Vainio (synth, vocals) and Antti Inkil√§inen (drums), who formed the band in February 2010. Inkil√§inen and Lepp√§nen had previously been working together in a band, and they often played shows with Jurmu's band \\"Yes Please!\\". After growing accustomed to each other, they decided to start their own group. Lepp√§nen later met K√§hk√∂nen in a local pub, who introduced him to Vainio. In October 2012 the band announced that Mikael had left the band and was replaced by Tuomas Asanti as the new bass player. Joni was replaced by Max Salonen in the beginning of 2014. The name of the band was chosen when K√§hk√∂nen was speaking to Lepp√§nen about a French foreign film he had just seen.Joni was talking to me about some French film he had just seen. Never mind what the movie was, I just thought that French Films would probably be a good name for a band. Since 2010 the band has been touring all over Europe, and also played shows in Japan, China and United States. Their first performance outside of Finland was in Skopje, Macedonia in the summer of 2010. French Films has been performing at some of the big European festivals like Roskilde Festival, Hultsfred Festival and Flow Festival. In July 2013 the band opened for Muse at their concert in the Helsinki Olympic Stadium. French Films is a winner of the 2013 European Border Breakers Awards.

Imaginary Future (2011) French Films released their debut album, Imaginary Future in September 2011. The album received positive reviews throughout the world, though it was mostly noted by the independent music media. Imaginary Future also won a European Border Breakers Award in the beginning of 2013. The band itself is quoted as saying \\"We think it's a good combination of roughness of punk and the softness of dream pop\\".  White Orchid (2013) In early 2013 it was announced that French Films' second album called White Orchid will come out April/May 2013 in Europe and Asia.

For bodies which appear smaller in angular diameter than the Sun, the proper term would be a transit and bodies which are larger than the apparent size of the Sun, the proper term would be an occultation. All of Neptune's inner moons and Triton can eclipse the Sun as seen from Neptune. All other satellites of Neptune are too small and/or too distant to produce an umbra. From this distance, the Sun's angular diameter is reduced to one and a quarter arcminutes across. Here are the angular diameters of the moons that are large enough to fully eclipse the Sun: Naiad, 7‚Äì13'; Thalassa, 8‚Äì14'; Despina, 14‚Äì22'; Galatea, 13‚Äì18'; Larissa, 10‚Äì14'; Proteus, 13‚Äì16'; Triton, 26‚Äì28'. Just because the moons are large enough to fully eclipse the Sun does not necessarily mean that they will do so. Eclipses of the Sun from Neptune are rare due to the planet's long orbital period and large axial tilt of 28 degrees. In addition, the largest moon, Triton, has an orbital inclination of about 25 degrees to Neptune's equator. This makes eclipses of the Sun by Triton rare. Even when such an eclipse does occur, it passes rather quickly, as Triton moves in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation.

It is typically less than long across the back, and is variable in colouration, to match its background. It may have been the crab seen by Christopher Columbus on Sargassum weed in the Sargasso Sea in 1492. Description Planes minutus is a small crab, reaching a maximum carapace length of , and typically less than . It has conspicuous eyes in wide orbits at the corners of the wide front edge of the carapace. The first pair of pereiopods (walking legs) bear a symmetrical pair of chelae with cutting teeth; the other four pairs are adorned with spines on the last two segments of each leg. It differs from the larger P. major in that males have a broadly triangular abdomen, rather than one which narrows abruptly after the third segment, and from P. marinus in having flattened legs with a fringe of setae that aid in swimming. The colouration of Planes minutus is very variable, and camouflages the crab against the Sargassum weed it often lives on. The base colour is typically brown, sometimes tending towards yellow or red. This is often supplemented with large patches of white, apparently imitating the calcareous tubes attached by annelid worms to Sargassum. Although the colour pattern tends to match that of the substrate on which the crab is found, the colouration is only able to change slowly after a change of substrate. Distribution Planes minutus is found in the North Atlantic Ocean, between the latitudes of 11¬∞ N and 32¬∞ N, and also from the west coast of Africa, the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Occasionally the crab has been recorded on the Cornish coast, the first publish record was at Falmouth in 1845 by William Pennington Cocks. Others specimens followed such as in 1848 (Falmouth) and 1899 on the Manacles. The latest occurred in 2015. Related species, such as Planes major (formerly P. cyaneus) and Planes marinus, occur in other parts of the world's oceans Ecology A Columbus crab living on a loggerhead sea turtle Planes minutus is exclusively pelagic, inhabiting a wide variety of substrates, including Sargassum weed, floating timbers and the hulls of ships. It is often found in association with turtles, especially the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta. It had been thought that the crab fed on the turtle's faeces, but it is now thought to fill a cleaning role. Although proficient at swimming, Planes minutus has little endurance, being capable of swimming for less than 45 minutes at before sinking. It uses all its legs while swimming, the first two pairs holding the crab up in the water, and the remaining legs propelling it forwards. The legs may begin to beat before the crab releases itself from its resting place, allowing it to accelerate more quickly. Attacks on passing animals only normally occur within of the crab's substrate. The diet of P. minutus is very varied, including small fish, krill, isopods, sea skaters and squid, and food items may be stored for later consumption. Taxonomic history The first record of Planes minutus may have been made by Christopher Columbus during his first voyage to the New World. On September 17, 1492, in the Sargasso Sea near , he recorded \\"much more weed appearing, like herbs from rivers, in which they found a live crab, which the Admiral kept. He says that these crabs are certain signs of land\\". It is thought that this is likely to refer to Planes, rather than the larger Portunus sayi, which rarely occurs so far east. As a result, crabs of the genus Planes are sometimes known as \\"Columbus crabs\\". Sporadic records followed from different oceans, but the first name to be accepted under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature is the name \\"Cancer minutus\\", published by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae. In 1825, Thomas Edward Bowdich described the species under the name \\"Planes clypeatus\\"; Bowdich's genus is now used for all the Columbus crabs, but Linnaeus' species name has priority, and so the species is now known as Planes minutus.

It is co-written by Jonathan Igla and Matthew Weiner and directed by Weiner. It originally aired on the AMC channel in the United States on June 10, 2012. In the episode, which primarily takes place around Easter 1967, the firm looks to expand its office space after a profitable quarter. Roger seeks to resume his affair with Megan's mother, while Pete has a final encounter with Beth. Megan struggles to find acting work and asks for Don's help, and Peggy is adjusting to life away from Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. Plot Don (Jon Hamm) soothes an aching tooth with a cotton ball soaked with whiskey at home. Megan (Jessica Par√©) offers to schedule him a dental appointment, but he declines. Her visiting mother Marie (Julia Ormond) consoles her when she receives a rejected screen test reel. Howard (Jeff Clarke) and Beth Dawes (Alexis Bledel) join Pete (Vincent Kartheiser) on the train. Howard explains that Beth will be staying with her sister for a while. Beth quickly excuses herself and Howard follows. Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) joins Joan (Christina Hendricks) on the elevator and sees that she pressed the 38th-floor button. She calls it an accident, deflecting Harry's questions about the agency's moving to another floor. As Don heads in to work, he passes an elevator whose doors are closing. Inside he sees a man who looks like his dead brother, Adam (Jay Paulson). Beth calls Pete at his office, asking him to meet her at the Hotel Pennsylvania. He hangs up after telling her that he hopes she likes waiting, for that is what he has had to do. At a partners meeting, Joan announces revenue is up 34% from last year, making it their best-ever quarter. She has plans to meet with the building manager about new office space, but cautions against overextending and suggests postponing a final decision until June. The partners agree. At CGC, Ted Chaough (Kevin Rahm) tosses Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) an unlabeled carton of a Philip Morris' \\"top secret ladies' cigarette\\" and tells her to \\"Smoke it, name it, sell it.\\" Pete arrives at Beth's hotel room. She reveals she is starting electroshock therapy the next day. She has been depressed and it is the only thing that will help, but it might erase her memory of him. In bed, he urges her to forgo treatment and stay with him. She declines, explaining that electroshock does work. At the Draper home, Megan and her friend Emily (Emily Foxler) discuss the difficulty of finding work as actresses. The phone rings and Megan answers, but no one responds. Emily asks if Don can get her an audition for Butler shoes' \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" commercial. Megan agrees, but later gives Don a copy of her own screen test instead, asking him to recommend her for the Butler commercial. He refuses, asserting she wants to be \\"somebody's discovery, not somebody's wife.\\" She relents and later cries in the bathroom. Roger calls the Draper home pretending to be Emile and asks for Marie. Roger admits to her that he hung up on Megan several times that day and invites Marie to his room at the Stanhope Hotel for a rendezvous. Entering the office the next day, Don passes an employee who looks like Adam. Joan, still visibly despondent over Lane's suicide, informs Don that SCDP will receive a $175,000 insurance payout for Lane's death. He tells her to repay Lane's wife the $50,000 Lane gave the company after Lucky Strike left. As she leaves, Don ices his tooth. He later visits Rebecca Pryce and hands her a $50,000 check. After showing Don the photo of Dolores and asking who she is, Rebecca accuses the agency of short-changing Lane and tells him to not leave thinking he has done anything for anyone but himself. Marie wakes Megan at midday and tells her to stop feeling sorry for herself. She compares Megan's situation to that of a little girl wishing to be a ballerina, stating that the world could not support that many of them. When Megan asks if that is what Marie tells herself, Marie calls her ungrateful and walks out. Later, Marie and Roger enter his hotel room, kissing passionately. He tells her Lane has died and asks her to take LSD with him. She declines, asking him to not ask her to take care of him. Trudy (Alison Brie) shows Pete her plans for a backyard pool, but he calls it \\"permanent\\" and warns that daughter Tammy could drown. She chastises him, saying she is tired of the \\"doom and gloom\\". He later visits Beth at the hospital. When she does not recognize him, he tells her he is visiting a friend who became heartbroken after an affair ended. Don arrives home to find Megan drunk and escorts her to bed. She throws herself at him, saying her sex appeal is all he wants and is the reason he will not give her acting career a chance. Marie enters the apartment, and Don scolds her for leaving Megan alone. Marie advises him to help Megan through this crisis, so he will have the life he desires. He grimaces, holding his cheek. He later visits the dentist for an extraction and, while anesthetized, sees Adam's ghost, who tells him it is not his tooth that is rotten. When Don asks Adam not to leave him, Adam smiles and tells him he will be \\"hanging around\\". Don goes to a movie theater and sees Peggy seated, about to watch Casino Royale. He joins her, telling her he is proud of her success but did not know it would be without him. Howard wakes Pete on the train. Pete argues that Howard could not wait to hospitalize Beth and \\"erase her brain\\". Realizing Pete has slept with Beth, Howard throws his fists at Pete, who then fights with the conductor and is kicked off the train. At home, Pete tells Trudy he fell asleep at the wheel and drove into a ditch. Concerned about his welfare, she agrees that he should have an apartment in the city. Alone at the office, Don watches Megan's screen test and smiles. Joan later shows the partners around the prospective new office space and Pete remarks \\"I'm going to have the same view as you, Don.\\" The five partners stand in front of the windows and look out across Manhattan. Dressed as \\"Beauty\\", Megan kisses Don on the set of Butler's commercial and tells him she loves him. He watches her a moment, then walks off. He sits down at a bar and orders an Old Fashioned. On her first business trip, Peggy looks out of her motel room window and sees two dogs mating. She is shocked, then gets into bed with a glass of wine and her work and smiles. At home, Pete sits in the dark with headphones on, eyes closed. Roger stands naked on a chair facing the hotel window, arms outstretched anticipating his LSD to hit. A blonde approaches Don at the bar, tells him her girlfriend (a brunette) is interested, and asks if he is alone. He turns and looks at her. Production \\"The Phantom\\" explores the guilt of various characters, including Don Draper (Hamm), who feels responsible for the death of his brother Adam As in past seasons, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner started writing \\"The Phantom\\" by conjuring up the final images. \\"I envisioned in the beginning that Peggy would be in that hotel room,\\" he remarked, \\"seeing those dogs [rutting] in the parking lot, and that she would be happy about being on her first business trip; and that Pete would have this moment of realizing what had happened to him, that this activity was a symbol that something bigger was wrong; Roger would long to get that feeling back, because it had worn off; and that Don would be in that bar. That was the last image, always, that someone would come up and say, 'Are you alone?' And we wouldn't know what he answers.\\" \\"The Phantom\\" metaphorically depicts the guilt and contrition of various characters of the series, including main character Don Draper‚Äîwho feels that he encouraged one of his coworkers to commit suicide‚Äîand his wife Megan, who is conflicted with her aspirations and the slights from her mother. The death of Lane Pryce, who dies in \\"Commissions and Fees\\", looms over the episode. Although Lane's name is not mentioned, Weiner noted that the audience could discern his presence. \\"We feel his presence in conversations with Joan in the office, certainly when Don goes to see Rebecca [Lane's widow], we see his chair there in the background.\\" Although The New York Times columnist Dave Iztkoff suggested that \\"The Phantom\\" was a deliberate tribute to The Sopranos finale \\"Made in America\\", Weiner proclaimed otherwise; \\"I say this without any humility whatsoever, that anything that people find comparable to The Sopranos is flattering to me. It was not deliberate by any means ‚Äî this not the end of the show. We have to come back next season and we don't know how he's going to answer but we know he's in a different place. But you recognize that guy when he looks up. We haven't seen him in a while.\\" Themes relating to feminism are imbued in \\"The Phantom\\", particularly in a scene where Peggy goes to see a film with Don. To Elisabeth Moss, this scene was fundamental for her character's progression, as it demonstrated that Peggy and Don were equals for the first time. \\"For once, they were just friends meeting at a movie theater\\", asserted Moss. As Weiner summed up, \\"There's a new respect. He's very frank with her and they're much more like colleagues now that he doesn't own her anymore.\\" In another scene, Peggy arrives at a hotel in Richmond, Virginia, where she is staying for a business conference. \\"Then she gets to fly for the first time [...] and she's staying at this Holiday Inn, and there's these dogs outside of the window, and she has her work on the bed and her wine. She's by herself, and she's so supremely happy.\\" In making the stunt, the trainers affirmed that the dogs may copulate during production; the incident did take place on the last day of shooting on the set of a parking lot of a replica of a Holiday Inn. \\"It was incredible to me ‚Äî these dogs have been waiting for that moment their whole lives,\\" stated Weiner, \\"We got what we needed, they got their treat, it was over.\\" In crafting the wardrobe for Megan throughout \\"The Phantom\\", costume designer Janie Bryant studied the mod subculture which was then at its apex. In particular, Megan sports a burgundy overcoat embroidered with windowpane patterns, strikingly reminiscent of one worn by the English model Twiggy. Reception=Critical reception The finale received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix commented: > \\"Some of the most memorable scenes and moments of the series' run occurred > over these last three months. 'The Phantom' was an episode that seemed to > take some of the smaller earlier missteps [of the season] and magnify them. > If not for a great final 10 minutes or so... I'd be going into [the] hiatus > feeling much more sour about the season than I should.\\" Newsdays Verne Gay said of \\"The Phantom\\": > \\"...just another episode... What was lacking, however, has been much the > same as the rest of the season ‚Äî a certain passion, or emotional resonance. > It all felt terribly chilly and remote ‚Äî characters in service of Matt > Weiner's grand overarching themes, as opposed to an episode in service of > their hearts.\\" More approvingly, Matt Zoller Seitz, writing in New York Magazines Vulture blog, wrote of the finale: > \\"...a summation of core Mad Men themes: the displacement of an existing > order by a new one; the gradual, mysterious, outwardly imperceptible changes > experienced by individuals, businesses, cities, and nations over decades; > and the possibility of reinventing oneself and starting over, again and > again and again.\\" Ratings \\"The Phantom\\" garnered the highest ratings for a Mad Men season finale to date, attracting 2.7 million viewers. 1.4 million adults in Mad Mens core demographic of the 25-54 age range watched the finale while 1.2 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic viewed the finale. In response, AMC President Charlie Collier said, \\"As in each season prior, Season 5 is now Mad Mens most- watched season, an uncommon television growth record and a testament to the ongoing quality and uniqueness of this rare property. I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the record live-same-day Nielsen ratings that gain so much attention are only a small part of the Mad Men success story. Congratulations to the entire Mad Men team on another terrific season.\\" Accolades Julia Ormond received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her work as Marie Calvet for the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards. The episode also received nominations for Outstanding Cinematography for a Single-Camera Series and Outstanding Hairstyling for a Single-Camera Series.

It is located in Belorechenskiy, Lutuhynskiy district of Luhansk region, Ukraine. The mined coal rank is \\"G\\" ‚Äì electric-power coke. As of 1 June 2011 reserves of the mine amounted to 11.6 million tons. There is an opportunity to cut further spare reserves, following which the mineable reserves could amount up to 70 million tons of coal. History The design and engineering of the mine began in 1949. The project was named Bilorichenska after Belaya river. The mine was planned in the area where \\"a burning stone\\" in the chalk deposits was found in the 18th century. The building of the shaft started in December 1950 and construction of the surface structures started in September 1951. The mine was commissioned in 1957. In 1960‚Äì70, Bilorichenska miners became several times the winners of all-union socialist competitions. In 1975 the mine exceeded the targeted state plan and raised 670 thousand tons of coal. At this rate the mine continued to work for the following one and a half decades. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the production decreased rapidly due to lack of investments and technology. In 1996 coal production amounted to only 193 thousand of tons. By this time all the coal reserves of the coal beds Almaznyi and Kamenskiy series were exhausted. In September 2002 a new shaft was put into exploitation, equipped with 3KD-90 heavy duty complex. Due to this, in 2003 for the first time in its history the mine acquired the capacity of 750 thousand tons. In 2008 the mine developed its first \\"1 million tons of coal\\" per year. During the following seven years a series of faces along the L6 bed 725 m horizon were put into production, namely: the original eastern, 5th western, 2nd eastern, 2nd western, 6th western, 5th bis western, 3rd western and 1st bis eastern. Each of these faces is equipped with modern heavy duty complexes and machines. In 2010 coal production at Bilorichenska amounted to 1.182 million tons. In 2011 one more face was put into production -7th western. Its production totalled above 100 thousand tons of coal per month. What is more, a Coal Dry Cleaning Machine was put into operation and a new Diesel House opened at the mine. As of 2012, there are above 3000 employees at the mine. Ownership After the collapse of the Soviet Union the mine belonged to the state owned Luhanskvuhillya coal mining group. In 2001, the mine declared insolvency and the re-capitalization process started. In 2002 the mine obtained a strategic partner Valentin-Invest, a holding company of Ukrainian businessman Igor Martynenkov, who obtained the majority stake in the mine while the state-owned shares decreased to 25.83%. The recapitalization plan was approved by court in 2007. This decision was annulled by the High Commercial Court of Ukraine in 2010. In 2012 the court decided to return the mine into the state ownership. On 14 September 2012, the Ukrainian state took control over the mine by force. Some media sources links this action to the participation of Igor Martynenkov at the parliamentary election running against the candidate of the Party of Regions. Production safety At the mine territory a rescue-workers school was built, which later became a basis for the only mine rescue station in Ukraine. Besides, in 2004 the mine purchased 14 units ‚ÄúYUREK-6‚Äù, what made it possible to equip all the main and local conveyor lines with fire-fighting systems. Social responsibility Bilorichenska mine has renovated a culture centre and a nursing school \\"Rosinka\\" (Dewdrop) of Belorechenskiy settlement and opened a museum of Bilorichenska mine. In August 2011 gas lines were led in the settlement. Water supply and sewerage of Belorechenskiy township are provided managed by the mine.

In 1936, the Ynchausti family completed the divestment of most of their corporate holdings with the intention of adopting a less visible business profile. The company was founded, majority owned, and led by the Ynchausti family for the entirety of its operations. Its primary lines of business during operation included banking, shipping, sugar production and trade, two distilleries (alcohol production), abaca production and trade, insurance, and real estate. It also figured prominently in infrastructure development during the 19th century. The company was likely the first Philippine-owned multi-national conglomerate and, as a result, is one of the Philippine's most storied and influential industrial groups of its time. At the height of its operations, the company maintained offices in Manila, Iloilo City, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, New York and San Francisco. A number of the businesses whose beginnings involved Ynchausti y Compa√±ia, or members of the Ynchausti family, remain active in the Philippines today.  Inception  One of the major Spanish trading companies of the 18th century was Real Compa√±√≠a Guipuzcoana de Caracas. This company began in operations in 1728 and lasted until 1785, when their royal charter was withdrawn. The company held the monopoly on trade between Spain and Venezuela, through various ports in Spain, the Basque Country, and Venezuela. Many of the owners were Basques, from the province of Gipuzkoa. In 1785, with the lapsing of its royal decree, the company was reformed by its owners into Real Compa√±√≠a de Filipinas. With the formation of Real Compa√±√≠a de Filipinas, traders began making the journey to the Spanish colony. Concurrent with the influx of new traders and businessmen was the addition of foreign capital and expertise. For centuries, the Philippines was a relatively sleepy colony. The 19th century saw a dramatic economic boom in the Philippines, driven in part by the Real Compa√±√≠a de Filipinas. Among the Basque traders was Jos√© Antonio de Ynchausti. He was a ship-owner and captain from Gipuzkoa who originally plied the trade waters between Spain and Venezuela. With his son, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Ynchausti, he established a presence in the city of Manila. The first company, J.J. Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a, was founded in 1816. Its primary line of business was ship chandlery, though it was also involved in general trade operations. Over time, Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Ynchausti became a prominent, well- respected, and connected businessman. Eventually he played a role in the politics of the day, sitting on a number of high profile advisory councils. He was involved in the Assembly of Reformists, a body composed of Filipinos who made recommendations for reforms in the Philippines to the Spanish crown. He was an influential figure during his time and instrumental in laying the foundation for the economic future of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a and his family.  19th Century: The Puente Colgante and Beyond  Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a maintained offices and holdings on both sides of the Pasig River. In the 1840s, a decision was made by the Spanish government to develop much needed infrastructure and Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a was awarded the franchise to construct the Puente Colgante soon after. This bridge spanned the Pasig River and connected the Binondo area (Muella de la Industria where the headquarters and warehouses of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a were located) and Intramuros (the original walled city of Manila). The bridge was designed and built by Matias Menchacatorre y Compa√±√≠a, a Spanish-Basque engineering firm. The original name of the bridge was Puente de Claver√≠a, named after the Governor-General of the Philippines Naciso Claver√≠a (a Basque from San Sebasti√°n, Gipuzkoa). However, because of its modern and unique design it became more commonly known as the Puente Colgante, or Hanging Bridge. This bridge is notable because it was the first steel suspension bridge in Asia, and one of the first in the world. Construction on it began in 1849 and was completed in 1852. Tolls from pedestrian and carriage use of the bridge was an important, early source, of income from Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a. The Puente Colgante was a visible sign of the affluence and influence of the Ynchausti family. By 1854, Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a began to expand its interests and scope. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Ynchausti was one of the founding members, director, and primary stockholder of Banco Espa√±ol-Filipino de Isabel II (presently, the Bank of the Philippine Islands). The Tanduay Distilery and Hagonoy Distillery were also founded by the Ynchausti family, in cooperation with Valent√≠n Teus e Yrissary (who was a trusted agent, manager, and minority shareholder in Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a). Tanduay became one of the most decorated Philippine companies of the 19th century, winning numerous international awards for its rum. Tanduay, now owned by the LT Group, remains a popular beverage manufacturer. Famously, the most prominent example of Tanduay's roots is that every bottle of rum still carries the Ynchausti family crest even today. While there have been stories to the contrary, such as the logo being 'made up', the truth is that the Ynchausti family used their coat of arms for Tanduay's logo. Additional interests of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a were in sugar, abaca production, paints (YCO Paints and YCO Floor Wax) and shipping. By the late 19th century Ynchausti Shipping was the largest inter-island shipping company in the Philippines. Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a was one of the largest sugar producers as well, becoming the largest during the 1900s. Among its sugar assets was the famed sugar central, La Carlota. Almost all of its sugar assets were located in Negros. It was the only domestic owned company that was the equal, or greater, in terms of production as foreign sugar companies. It also spearheaded the development of Manila hemp (abaca) rope, becoming the single-largest producer in the Philippines. In Manila, it owned vast amounts of land, specifically along what was known as Calle Real, or Roxas Boulevard today. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Ynchausti died in 1889, leaving management of the firm to his two sons, Rafael and Joaqu√≠n Jos√©. Jos√© Joaqu√≠n also had a daughter, Clotilde, who married a prominent Manila-based French businessman by the name of Arturo Vidal S√°enz, eventually settled in France. Under the dual management of the siblings Rafael and Joaqu√≠n Jos√©, Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a expanded its interests throughout the Philippines, becoming the largest conglomerate of its day. They successfully shepherded it through the Philippine Revolution, supporting the First Philippine Republic by buying war bonds and paying taxes. The brothers were also able to successfully navigate the early American colonial era, maintaining the company's status as a major economic force. Starting in the mid-19th century and continuing until the company was dissolved, the Ynchausti brothers were supported by their professional managers and minority shareholders, and lawyers. Two prominent Philippine families got their start either working for the Ynchausti family or as employees and (later) stockholders of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a. These are the Araneta family (Gregorio Araneta and his son Salvador Araneta were trusted personal and corporate lawyers and acted as agents representing the interests of the family) and the Elizalde family. Members of the Elizalde family migrated to the Philippines to act as managers in Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a.  The 20th Century: Growth and Divestment  The early portion of the 20th century saw the Ynchausti family adjusting to the new colonial leadership under the United States of America; it was not without its difficulties. However, they were able to adjust and expand their asset base. From 1900 until 1920 the company continued its Philippine industrial dominance. When the United States reviewed the Philippines in 1898 they identified two major companies: Tabacalera and Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a. In 1915, Rafael de Ynchausti died. He was survived by two daughters: Angelina and Mar√≠a de la Consolaci√≥n (Consuelo). Angelina married Jos√© McMicking Sr, then the Sheriff of Manila. Among their children was Jos√© Rafael McMicking de Ynchausti (later known as Joseph \\"Joe\\" R. McMicking). He married Mercedes Z√≥bel de Ayala, of the venerable Z√≥bel de Ayala clan. Starting with an initial investment in Ayala y Compa√±√≠a (precursor of Ayala Corporation) in the post-World War II reconstruction years, McMicking eventually became the primary shareholder of Ayala y Compa√±√≠a, as well as the intellectual force and guiding light behind Ayala's rapid growth in the 20th century. He conceptualized the development of Makati City, as well as the famous residential development Sotogrande in Spain. Through his efforts, Ayala became one of the country's largest and most important conglomerates, a reputation it still maintains today. Consuelo de Ynchausti married Ignacio R. Ortigas. Their descendants became majority shareholders in Ortigas & Company, one of the Philippine's oldest and most prominent real estate developers. Among Ortigas & Company's assets and developments are the famous Greenhills Shopping Center and Ortigas Business District. After Rafael's death, Joaqu√≠n Jos√© de Ynchausti took over management of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a. He came to rely on the Elizalde family for assistance in managing the firm's vast assets. In 1920 he embarked on a world trip. First, he traveled to Colorado in the United States to acquire a railway system from Baldwin Locomotive Works. The system he acquired was installed in the company's sugar centrals in Iloilo to help in transporting agricultural production. After that he journeyed to Spain to see his son, Manuel, who was studying law at the University of Madrid. Sadly, Joaqu√≠n Jos√© died of a heart attack at the Ritz-Carlton in Madrid. Manuel de Ynchausti, born in 1900, was Joaqu√≠n Jos√©'s only surviving son. As a result, he was the heir apparent of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a. However, because of his youth (he was only twenty at the time of his father's death) managerial control was instead entrusted to members of the Elizalde family until he came of age. By 1927, Manuel felt it was time to become more active. He completed his law studies at the University of Madrid and married a young Basque woman from San Sebasti√°n, Ana Bel√©n Laurrari. They returned to Manila and settled in the family's ancestral home along Calle Real. But, by that time he found it difficult to become involved because of certain internal corporate issues. Spurred by those issues, as well as changing global economic conditions, Manuel made the difficult decision to divest Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a of certain partners and some of its industrial assets, among them Ynchausti Shipping, Tanduay, YCO Paints and Floor Wax, Rizal Cement, and their sugar interests. The Rizal Cement factory, located in Binangonan, Rizal was established in 1924 and was the first cement factory in the Philippines. It was sold to Vicente Madrigal. The Elizalde family was able to acquire Tanduay, YCO Paints and Floor Wax, and some of the sugar interests. Around this asset base they formed Elizalde & Company, Inc. in 1936. Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a continued under the leadership of Manuel M. de Ynchausti, albeit with a much lower profile than before. The proceeds from the divestment of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a were distributed among the various Ynchausti family members, eventually funding their own business enterprises. On a personal level, Manuel became noted for his humanitarian efforts in the Philippines and in aid of Basque refugee women and children during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Most notably for the Philippines, in the 1920s he turned over thousands of hectares of land in Negros to the farmers and tillers who worked the land and to the Roman Catholic Church (primarily the Capuchin Order). He was awarded the Knighthood of Saint Gregory by Pope Pious XI in 1927 in recognition of his social outreach efforts. In reviewing the importance of Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a and the Ynchausti family, Alejandro R. Roces, Philippine National Artist in Literature, wrote: \\"The economic impact of the Ynchausti family becomes readily apparent when studying the family tree and history. They were an entrepreneurial clan that also balanced humanitarian considerations. Their humanitarian legacy, as much as the economic, is something well-worth remembering for this historic Filipino family.\\" References Defunct companies of the Philippines Companies based in Manila ","title":"Ynchausti y Compa√±√≠a"},{"id":"36104863","text":"Ant√¥nio Mattar Neto (born 14 November 1944) is a Brazilian former footballer who competed in the 1964 Summer Olympics.

The species are confined to the Afrotropical realm mainly in the Guinean Forests of West Africa and the Congolian forests. Description E. cyparissa Euphaedra are large and showy butterflies. They share a common wing shape. On the basal areas of the upperside of the wings (especially the hindwings) are large suffused patches of metallic green, blue, orange or red. Most species also have a cream or orange subapical bar. The undersides are various shades of yellow or green and marked with black streaks and spots. Many species also have pink patches or streaks on the undersides of the hindwings. The larvae are green, with yellow and pink markings and bear long and branched lateral spines. Biology Green species or forms are found in rain forest, yellow species or forms typically occur in drier and often more patchy forests. This is a camouflage adaptation to particular forest light patterns. The larvae of most species feed on Sapindaceae others on Anacardiaceae, Rutaceae, Sterculiaceae, Annonaceae, Palmae.

The species level taxonomy of these polymorphic and also hybridising butterflies is a challenge requiring a synthesis of studies of their evolutionary taxonomy, sympatry and molecular phylogenetics in combination with detailed morphological studies. This is so far only partly achieved. The type species of the genus is Papilio cyparissa Cramer. Species groups Defining species groups is a convenient way of subdividing well-defined genera with a large number of recognized species. Euphaedra species are so arranged in assemblages called \\"species groups\\" but (not superspecies, but an informal phenetic arrangement). These may or may not be clades. As molecular phylogenetic studies continue, lineages distinct enough to warrant some formal degree of recognition become evident and new groupings are suggested, but consistent ranking remains a problem.

It is located about 22 miles northeast of the town of Lovelock, and is managed by the Pershing County Water Conservation District. The reservoir stores water for the agricultural area surrounding Lovelock, which is at the far downstream reach of the Humboldt, near the Humboldt Sink. Since the Lovelock area receives a mere 5.76 inches of rain annually, agriculture requires irrigation, but the high variability of the Humboldt (which often runs completely dry) means that water storage is necessary for irrigation to be feasible. Rye Patch Settlement The settlement of Rye Patch got its start in the early 1860s, and at one time included a school and boarding house. Rye Patch was named for the wild dry grass that grew in the area. In 1869, the Central Pacific Railroad came to the region and the Rye Patch station opened. The stamp mill at Rye Patch processed ore from the mines at Star City, Unionville and Rochester until the late 1870s. The Rye Patch Post Office was in operation from June 1872 until November 1916. Rye Patch Dam In 1933, the Bureau of Reclamation decided to build the Rye Patch Dam to impound the Humboldt and create the reservoir. The dam was built between 1935 and 1936 to the west of Rye Patch station. A New Deal project intended to help fight the Great Depression, the dam was funded by the Public Works Administration and employed workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps. The dam was expanded in 1975‚Äì1976, raising the dam three feet to provide the reservoir with more storage capacity. Rye Patch Reservoir also includes the Pitt‚ÄìTaylor Reservoirs, two off-stream storage basins that predate Rye Patch. They were built in 1913 by Humboldt‚ÄìLovelock Irrigation, Light and Power Company, a private venture run by William C. Pitt, an upper Lovelock Valley rancher, and John G. Taylor, an upper valley farmer and sheep rancher. These reservoirs are less efficient than Rye Patch, losing much water to evaporation, so they are used only for additional capacity in high-flow years. The reservoir has experienced sedimentation, a problem common to reservoirs in which sediment settles out of the river flow and decreases the capacity of the reservoir. A 1972 study estimated that the reservoir had lost 10% of its capacity to sedimentation since construction.Rice, F. Eugene, and Bruce L. Rice. \\"Bathymetric Reconnaissance of Rye Patch Reservoir and the Pitt‚ÄìTaylor Reservoirs, Pershing County, Nevada.\\" Map. U.S. Geological Survey Library, Reston, VA. Carson City, NV: Nevada Division of Water Resources, 1972. Print. Water Resources Information Series Report, Vol. 13. The reservoir has come under criticism, particularly from upstream users who accuse Lovelock farmers of attempting to monopolize the waters of the Humboldt for their own use. For instance, when the reservoir was nearly drained in 1992 to provide water to the farms, anglers at the Rye Patch State Recreation Area complained of a massive fish kill. The project has also been criticized for single-minded focus on irrigation and skewed cost-benefit ratios. Furthermore, a study by the Nevada State Museum in 1987 concluded that construction of the Rye Patch and Pitt‚ÄìTaylor Reservoirs flooded archaeological and paleontological sites that showed evidence of prehistoric human habitation.

He further served in the capacity of Mayordomo mayor del rey and the Alf√©rez del rey of Ferdinand IV of Castile. He was a major benefactor of the city of Bilbao, where he expanded the local fishing village and granted it the power to maintain its customs market free of any Portazgo (royal tribute) answerable only to the authority of the Lord of Biscay.  Family origins  Diego L√≥pez was the son of Diego L√≥pez III de Haro and his wife, Constanza de Bearne. He eventually inherited the title of Lord of Biscay from his father after his sister and the usurper to the title, John of Castile. His paternal grandparents were Lope D√≠az II de Haro, Lord of Biscay, and his wife, Urraca Alfonso de Le√≥n, the illegitimate daughter of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. His maternal grandparents were Guillermo II de Bearne, the Viscount of Bearne, and his wife, Garsenda of Provence. Amongst his siblings were Lope D√≠az III de Haro, Lord of Biscay, Teresa de Haro, wife of Juan N√∫√±ez I de Lara, head of the House of Lara, and of Sancha D√≠az de Haro. He was the great grandson of the king, Alfonso IX of Le√≥n.  Biography = During the youth of Fernando IV de Castilla (1295‚Äì1301)  Diego L√≥pez' exact date of birth is unknown, but it most likely occurred sometime around the year 1250. In 1282, he married the infanta Violant of Castile, daughter of King Alfonso X of Castile. On 25 April, 1295, after the death of King Sancho IV of Castile (who the Haro family had fought to overthrow), Diego L√≥pez took advantage of the instability in the court of the young King Ferdinand IV of Castile and took power over the Lordship of Biscay which rightfully belonged to his sister, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro. The incessant fighting against the Castilian crown, led primarily by the following infantes; John of Castile, an enemy of the Haro family who claimed the throne as the heir to his brother, Sancho IV of Castile, Infante Henry of Castile, son of Ferdinand III of Castile and uncle of the young king Ferdinand IV, who claimed guardianship over the king. This was exacerbated by the claims of the infantes of Cerda, Ferdinand de la Cerda and Alfonso de la Cerda, who were supported by France, Arag√≥n, and their grandmother, Queen Violant of Aragon, widow of Alfonso X of Castile. Still further, problems also arose with the Kingdom of Aragon, Portugal, and France, who all tried to take advantage of the instability that plagued the contemporary Kingdom of Castile. Finally, internal Castilian players such as Diego L√≥pez V de Haro, Nu√±o Gonz√°lez de Lara, and Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara, amongst others, sowed confusion and anarchy throughout the kingdom. During the summer of 1295, after the Cortes of Valladolid of the same year, Diego L√≥pez was confirmed in his illegitimate possession of the Lordship over Biscay, turned over by the pretender to both Biscay and the Castilian throne, infante John of Castile. During this time, John also temporarily accepted Ferdinand IV as his sovereign and he regained his previous possessions and titles. On 15 June, 1300, Diego L√≥pez V de Haro converted the fishing village of Bilbao into a town under the authority of the Lords of Biscay. During the Cortes of Valladolid in 1300, the infante John of Castile officially renounced his pretendership to the throne despite being proclaimed king of Le√≥n in 1296. He took an oath of fealty ti Ferdinand IV and his successors on 26 June 1300. The same year, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro together with her husband (the same infante Juan), as compensation for renouncing her claim over the Lordship of Biscay, received title over Mansilla, Paredes de Nava, Medina de Rioseco, Castronu√±o, and Cabreros. A short while later, Maria de Molina, and the infantes Henry and John, accompanied by Diego L√≥pez V de Haro, laid siege to Almaz√°n, but lifted the siege due to opposition from the infante Henry.  During the adolescence of Fernando IV de Castilla (1301‚Äì1310)  In November 1301, Diego L√≥pez was in the court of the city of Burgos when the papal bull of Pope Boniface VIII made public the marriage of Mar√≠a de Molina (mother of Ferdinand IV) and the dead Sancho IV of Castile. This recognition by the pope, coupled with the coming of age of Ferdinand IV of Castile instantly made the claims to the throne of John of Castile, Henry of Castile, Alfonso de la Cerda, and Ferdinand de la Cerda much less plausible as they had thereby lost one of their principal claims to the throne. Going forward, the crown of Castile and Le√≥n was much more secure. The infante Henry, upset over the legitimization of Ferdinand IV by the pope, forged an alliance against the head of the House of Lara, Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara in an effort to alienate Ferdinand IV from his mother, Mar√≠a de Molina. The likewise embittered magnate, John of Castile started his own faction together with Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara in an effort to reclaim the Lordship of Biscay for his wife, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro. Later in 1301, the king placated Henry with titles over Atienza and San Esteban de Gormaz as compensation. In 1302, the rivalry between these two factions became clear with infante Henry, Maria de Molina and Diego Lopez on one side and the infante John of Castile and Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara on the other. The infante Henry threatened the Queen with a declaration of war against her and Ferdinand IV if she did not acquiesce to his demands. This coincided with a fall from grace of Maria de Molina as the contemporary magnates attempted to lessen the grip of power she had maintained over the king. In the final months of 1302, the queen was in Valladolid where she agreed to placate the members of the nobility who threatened her with war against King Ferdinand IV who spent Christmas with John of Castile and Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara in the Kingdom of Leon. In 1303, there was a meeting between the King Denis of Portugal and Ferdinand IV where in Ferdinand obtained the return of various territories. The split between the two aforementioned factions continued. In May of that year, celebrations over the success of the meeting (which neither Diego Lopez, Maria de Molina, or Henry of Castile participated in) were held in Badajoz. Further agreement was reached by Ferdinand IV and Denis of Portugal to obtain Portugal's assistance against the opposing faction. Diego Lopez' faction met in Roa with Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, giving the latter orders to travel to the Kingdom of Aragon and to enlist his support against Ferdinand IV. The group agreed to reunite on the Day of John the Baptist in the municipality of Ariza. Henry of Castile later conveyed this message to Maria de Molina who was in Valladolid at the time. Henry's plan was for Alfonso de la Cerda to become King of Leon, marrying the infanta Isabel de Castilla y de Molina, daughter of Maria de Molina and sister of Ferdinand IV. At the same time, the infante Pedro de Castilla y Molina, brother of Ferdinand IV, was to be named the King of Castile, marrying one of the daughters of James II of Aragon. Henry claimed that his intention was to foster peace in the kingdom and eliminate the influence of the infante John of Castile and that of Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara. This plan, which proposed the breakup of the Kingdoms of Castile and Le√≥n and the forced or obliged resignation of Fernando IV, was rejected by the queen Maria de Molina who refused to meet the rebel faction in Ariza. At the same time, the queen was asked by King Ferdinand IV to help foster a peace between him and the rebel faction. The queen traveled to Ariza where instead of supporting the rebel cause, she pleaded with the group to remember their oaths of fealty to the king and to return to his service causing many of the rebels to abandon the cause of infante Henry and Diego Lopez. This move, which weeded out many of the more moderate rebels, served only to cement the hardline base who vowed to wage war against the king, demanding further that the Kingdoms of Murcia and Ja√©n be turned over to Alfonso de la Cerda. It was during this time that the infante Henry of Castile became deathly ill and retired to his villa at Roa. Fearing that Henry's possessions would revert to Diego Lopez and Juan Manuel upon his death as was his wish, the queen plotted with Henry's confessor to convince him to leave all his possessions to the crown. This move inevitably failed and Diego Lopez, together with Juan Manuel inherited all his possessions when Henry died on 8 August 1303. He was sepulchered at the now destroyed Monasterio de San Francisco de Valladolid. In November 1303, the king asked the queen for her support in an effort to end the infighting between infante John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos and Diego Lopez for control over the Lordship of Biscay which at this time was under the full control of Diego Lopez. The queen agreed to help her son and the relationship of mother and son was restored when she succeeded in reaching an agreement with the infante John. In winter of 1304, the king was in the area of Carri√≥n de los Condes when the infante John once again claimed for his wife the lordship of Biscay together with the continued support of Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara. The king attempted to offer her title over Paredes de Nava and Villal√≥n de Campos as compensation, but this was refused by the infante John. The king then drafted a lopsided deal where Diego Lopez V would turn over his titles over Tordehumos, √çscar and Santa Olalla. He would also be made to give up his possessions in Cu√©llar, C√≥rdoba, Murcia, Valdetorio, and his title as Se√±or√≠o de Valdecorneja. In return for this, Diego would be able to keep Lordship of Biscay, Ordu√±a-Urdu√±a, Balmaseda, las Encartaciones, and Durango. Understandably, the infante John accepted these terms and the king called Diego Lopez to Carri√≥n de los Condes to cement the deal. Not surprisingly, Diego Lopez V refused these demands and threatened an all out rebellion against his rule. The king, who was at the time preparing for the Treaty of Torrellas, from which Diego Lopez was excluded, promised the infante John that he would receive Biscay after all and that Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara would get La Bureba. He further stated that both could divvy up the territories currently belonging to Diego Lopez in La Rioja if the two could resolve the diplomatic crisis that was ongoing with Aragon. In April 1304, the infante John commenced negotiations with the Kingdom of Aragon to resolve demands made by Alfonso de la Cerda and disputes held by the Aragon. In the meantime, the king confiscated the territories of Diego Lopez V and of Juan Alfonso de Haro, Se√±or de los Cameros and divided them up amongst his supporters. After this bold move, many of the rebels came back under the fold of the king. In winter of 1305, Diego Lopez once again refused the kings demands that he hand over Biscay at Guadalajara. = Fighting over possession over the Lordship of Biscay (1305‚Äì1307) = In 1305, Diego Lopez V was called to present himself in the courts of Medina del Campo which took place that year, to respond to the demands of the king. At the court, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro, Diego's niece and wife of the infante John, demanded the return of her rightful property, the title of Lord of Biscay, a title which Diego had taken in the unrest that surrounded King Ferdinand IV of Castile's younger days on the throne. While the infante John and Maria were presenting their case to the court, Diego Lopez, together with three hundred of his knights arrived at the court and Diego Lopez announced his refusal to give up his title, citing a deal struck in the year 1300 where his niece had renounced her claim. Diego Lopez V left the court without waiting for its final decision and began drafting a proposal soliciting aid from the pope. It was around this time that Diego Lopez forged a new alliance with Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara who had gotten into disputes with the infante John. Seeing himself in a losing position, the infante John signed a two-year truce with Diego Lopez as he assumed the new alliance between Diego Lopez and the House of Lara would not hold. Trouble came quickly to this relationship as Lope D√≠az IV de Haro, Diego Lopez' son and heir entered into a dispute with Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara and he attempted to get his father to accept the kings deal. The same year, Ferdinand IV gave Lope Diaz IV the charge of Mayordomo Mayor of the king. The king called for a meeting with Diego Lopez V, to which Diego Lopez brought along Juan N√∫√±ez II in an effort to reconcile the latter with the king, while the king maneuvered to split the powerful duo. The king failed in his efforts and the two rebels left without notifying the king. At the same time, ambassadors from France arrived to solicit an alliance with the kingdom through marriage of Ferdinand IV's sister, the infanta Isabella. . In April 1306, the infante John, against the advice of Maria de Molina, induced the king to declare war officially against Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara in the knowledge that Diego Lopez would support his ally. The forces of the king laid siege to Aranda de Duero where Juan Nunez was at the time. Juan immediately broke his oath of vassal to the king. After a series of skirmishes, Juan Nunez managed to escape from the siege while pretending to surrender the city. He moved from there to meet with Diego Lopez and his son, Lope Diaz IV where the three promised to wage war against the king in their respective territories. As most of the kings vassals were unsupportive of the war, costs spiraled as they demanded war preparation funds and made little effort to use the money effectively. The king ordered for the infante John to enter into negotiations with Diego Lopez V, something he agreed to without issue as his vassals were equally unsupportive of the war. The two sent the queen, Maria de Molina to negotiate a peace. Negotiations with the rebels were hosted by Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n in the town of Pancorbo. Negotiations with Diego Lopez quickly broke down and he again decided to continue to appeal to the pope. At the beginning of 1307, while the king, Maria de Molina and the infante John were in Valladolid, they heard news that Pope Clement V renounced the validity of the renunciation over Biscay of 1300. The king drafted a new agreement whereby Diego Lopez V would keep Biscay during the course of his life, but it would revert to Maria II of Haro upon his death and would not go to his son, Lope Diaz IV who would instead inherit Ordu√±a-Urdu√±a and Balmaseda, and get Miranda de Ebro and Villalba de Losa from the king. The group convened on the court of Vallalodid to reach a final agreement. Before the agreement over Biscay was finally reached, Juan Nunez II de Lara left the courts feeling betrayed by the king and his mother. For this reason, the king granted Diego Lopez V the title of Mayordomo Mayor of the king, a move which in turn upset the infante John enough to leave the courts, warning the king that he would no longer be of service to him until the wardens of Diego Lopez' castles paid tribute to his wife (upon Diego Lopez' death according to the agreement). Regardless, the group met again in Lerma where it was agreed that the castles that would go to Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro would begin to pay her tribute, whilst the castles going to Lope D√≠az IV de Haro would do the same for him. With the reconciliation of Diego Lopez V and of the infante John, the king demanded that Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara leave the Kingdom of Castile and for him to return the castles of Cuenca and Ca√±ete located in the Province of Cuenca that the king had earlier given to him. The king proceeded to Tordehumos in October 1307 where he began to siege the city together with the infante John, his son, Alfonso de Valencia, and the Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, Juan Os√≥rez. It was around the same time that the king also received a papal order to take all the possessions of the Knights Templar into his possession. Added to other complications, King Ferdinand IV decided to reach a peace treaty with Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara where Lara agreed to turn all his territories over to the king minus those in La Bureba and La Rioja. After the siege and the peace agreement, many nobles, sensing an opportunity to grab power, attempted to create new friction between Lara, the infante John and the king. Convinced that the king wanted them both dead, Juan Nunez II and the infante Juan forged a new alliance together without attempting to reach out to Diego Lopez V. Despite assurances from the king to the contrary, this edgy conflict bubbled until 1309 when the king called a conference at the courts of Madrid (the first of its kind actually held in the capital). Present at this conference were all the major players left alive from the previous infighting. The king announced his intention to wage war against the Kingdom of Granada due to growing pressure to expand from his nobles. = The Conquest of Gibraltar and the Siege of Algeciras (1309) = Amongst the nobles that took part in the action were a majority of the nobles from the previous civil strife from both sides. These included Diego Lopez V de Haro, the infante John of Castile, Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara, Alonso P√©rez de Guzm√°n, Fern√°n Ruiz de Salda√±a, Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena and many other magnates from Castile. The Castilian forces were made up of the militias of the towns of Salamanca, Segovia, Seville, and many other cities. King Denis of Portugal also sent 700 knights under Mart√≠n Gil de Sousa, Alf√©rez of the king of Portugal. Furthermore, a great deal of knights from the orders of Santiago Calatrava were also present. Pope Clement V granted King Ferdinand IV a tenth of all taxes and rents collected by the church for a period of three years. This edict was passed by papal bull on 28 April 1309 from the city of Avignon. The Rock of Gibraltar, which was taken by Fernando IV on 12 September 1309. King Ferdinand IV of Castile set up his headquarters in the city of Seville where emissaries of king James II of Aragon announced their readiness to commence operations against the city of Almer√≠a. Ferdinand IV in turn decided to lay siege to the city of Algeciras which had been the main Muslim stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula for many years. Diego Lopez, amongst others opposed this plan and advocated unsuccessfully for an attack on Gibraltar. This was possibly due in part to the fact that the city had been unsuccessfully besieged in the past, most notably at the Siege of Algeciras (1278). Nevertheless, the Castilian-Leonese army gathered in the city and was transferred over the Guadalquivir River towards Algeciras. The vanguard of Ferdinand's army reached the city walls on 27 July 1309, followed three days later by the last of the Christian forces which included the king Ferdinand and his entourage. The other prong of attack led by James II of Aragon began its siege of Almer√≠a on 15 August of the same year. With the siege of Algeciras ongoing, Gibraltar fell to the forces of Ferdinand under the control of Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara, Archbishop of Seville, Fernando Guti√©rrez Tello and the Grand Master of the Order of Calatrava on 12 September 1309. In mid October 1309, the infante John of Castile, his son, Alfonso, Juan Manual, and Fern√°n Ruiz de Salda√±a deserted the Castilian encampment at Algeciras together with about fifty other knights. The action, which was due in part because Ferdinand IV owed them a great deal of money, provoked the indignation of the European monarchs and the protest of James II of Aragon who tried to persuade the deserters unsuccessfully to return to Algeciras. Nevertheless, King Ferdinand IV maintained the support of Juan N√∫√±ez II de Lara and of Diego Lopez de Haro and continued to try and take the city. Disease and generally poor conditions became so bad in the Christian camp that Ferdinand IV was forced to pawn the jewels and crowns of his wife, Constance of Portugal to pay his soldiers and knights. A short time later, the troops of Felipe de Castilla y Molina, brother of Ferdinand IV, arrived in the Christian camp accompanied by 400 knights and many footsoldiers under the command of the Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela. Towards the end of 1309, Diego Lopez V became sick as the result of an attack of gout, from which he would later die in Christian camp on the River Andarax. After months of failed attempts to take the city, Ferdinand IV decided to negotiate a peace with the Kingdom of Granada who had sent their emissary to the camp. They reached a deal where Ferdinand would lift the siege in return for 50,000 gold pieces and the towns of Quesada and Bedmar. Death and legacy Diego Lopez V de Haro died in winter of 1310 in the camp at Algeciras. His niece, Mar√≠a II D√≠az de Haro, wife of the infante John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos, took possession of the Lordship of Biscay. Further, the infante John returned the villas of Paredes de Nava, Cabreros, Medina de Rioseco, Castronu√±o and Mansilla to the king. After his death during the siege of Algeciras, his body was taken to the city of Burgos where he was sepulchered at the now destroyed Monasterio de San Francisco de Burgos.

It was formed in 1974 by recreational scuba divers and other persons to pursue an interest in maritime archaeology and maritime history. The SUHR was renamed as the South Australian Archaeology Society in March 2012 as part of a plan to expand its activities beyond maritime archaeology to include other archaeological disciplines.Reynolds, Steve; (2012) 'Club News' in SDF News Sheet ‚Äì June 2012‚Äù (Scuba Divers Federation of South Australia), at http://www.sdfsa.net/newsletters/2012/2012-06-News-Sheet.pdf, retrieved 11/06/2012 Origins The SUHR was founded in September 1974 by recreational scuba divers principally from the Underwater Explorers Club of South Australia (UEC) and occupational scuba divers from government agencies such as the South Australian Museum and the South Australian Police, as well as a number of individuals interested in maritime history.Brock, A.E., 1977, ‚ÄòThe Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia‚Äô, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology, Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 113-115. The origin of the SUHR is due in part to the positive public response to the aftermath of a successful expedition in 1973 to locate and recover two anchors discarded during 1803 by whilst under the command of Matthew Flinders off the coast of what is now Western Australia.Brock, A.E., 1977, ‚ÄòThe Society for Underwater Historical Research of South Australia‚Äô, In Green, J. (Ed.), 1977, Papers from the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology, Perth, Western Australia, Oceans Society of Australia, Australian Sports Publications, Melbourne, Victoria, pp. 114. The recovery of the anchors and their connection to the voyage of HMS Investigator is commemorated in the inclusion of the best bower anchor and the outline of the Australian continent on the SUHR emblem.‚ÄòSecond Annual Report, September 1976‚Äô, p.2, in Cowan, David (editor), (2007), The Society for Underwater Historical Research ‚Äì Publications 1974-2004, Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA. Organisation After its formation in 1974, the SUHR was initially managed by a committee consisting of a President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer and the following specialist officers ‚Äì Research Officer, Registrar of Relics (added in 1976), an officer to liaise with the responsible part of the South Australian Government which was initially the South Australian Museum, and an officer to liaise with the South Australian Police Force (removed in 1978). By the late 1970s, it had evolved into a project-based organisation whose work consisted of activities such as planning, research, exploration, logistics, photography, survey and the publication of reports. Activities such as recovery and conservation, while historically significant, ceased to be carried out in the late 1980s except where permitted by archaeological practice.Cowan, David; (2007), 'About the SUHR', in Cowan, David (editor); (2007), The Society for Underwater Historical Research ‚Äì Publications 1974-2004 , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA. pages 9-14. In April 1982, a group within the membership who were unhappy with the increasing level of professionalization, resigned and founded a competing organisation known as the Nautical Archaeology Association of South Australia.‚ÄòLetter to Society for Underwater Historical Research Committee‚Äô in the SUHR Newsletter for April 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), The Society for Underwater Historical Research ‚Äì Publications 1974-2004, Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.‚ÄòMinutes of the General Meeting held ‚Ä¶ on Tuesday 27 April 1982‚Äô in SUHR Newsletter for May 1982, Cowan, David (editor); (2007), The Society for Underwater Historical Research ‚Äì Publications 1974-2004 , Society for Underwater Historical Research, Port Adelaide, SA.

He is considered to be one of the most important South African sculptors, along with Moses Kottler and Anton van Wouw. Russia 1903 ‚Äì 1908 Israel-Isaac Lipshitz was born on 8 May 1903 as the second son of Shlomeh Josef Lipshitz of Dvinsk and Chayah Meray Faktor of Plungƒó, Lithuania. His paternal grandparents were of the Jewish Chassidic sect, while his maternal grandparents were of the Misnaged sect in February 1904, Israel's father set out for Cape Town in search of better prospects than were available to him in Plungƒó. He left his wife and the infant with the paternal grandfather Yankeh Fivah Faktor for the next four- and-a-half years. In his care the young Israel was taught to draw, carve wood and model in dough and candle grease. His grandfather had built the synagogue in Plungian, and it was in the decorative art of the synagogue that Israel first felt the impetus to artistic expression. Cape Town 1908 ‚Äì 1928 In 1908, Israel and his mother travelled to the port of Bremen, from where they arrived in Cape Town on 30 April 1908. In 1909, Israel started attending kindergarten classes at the Constitution Street Public School, where he received drawing instruction by the painter Ruth Prowse, and from 1911 to 1914 attended the Public Schools in Constitution and De Villiers Streets. From 1915 to 1917 he studied at Hope Mill School and matriculated in 1920 from the Normal College in Buitenkant Street. After school he pursued and abandoned a briefly held ambition to become a writer and enrolled, in April 1922, at the Cape Town Art School in Stal Plein. The Cape Town Art School was run by Mr. P. Thatcher and Mr. C. S. Groves, who imposed a tradition of British academic discipline. Lipshitz developed friendships with painter Russel Harvey and sculptor Moses Kottler. Through Kottler, who had studied at the Bezalel Art School in Jerusalem and in Germany, before settling in Cape Town in 1915, Lipshitz made contact with modern art. In 1925 Lipshitz met the Russian Jewish sculptor Herbert Vladimir Meyerowitz, who arrived from Berlin and was appointed lecturer at Michaelis School of Fine Art. They became friends and Meyerowitz invited him to be his assistant as Michaelis. Lipshitz derived considerable benefit from this relationship as he learned from Meyerowitz's skill in woodcarving. He also received an introduction to West African sculpture from Meyerowitz, who lent him a copy of Carl Einstein's Negerplastik (1915), an art-historical piece on primitivism. At the end of 1926 a disagreement led to a parting of ways between Meyerowitz and Lipshitz. Isaac took up a studio with Russel Harvey in the Wasserfall and Hardick building in Church Street among painters George Crosland Robinson and Constance Penstone and sculptor Thackeray Edwards. Towards the end of 1928, Lipshitz decided to further his education in Paris. He married Rachil Sief on 8 May 1928 and soon after made his departure for the City of Lights thanks to a grant from Ernest Oppenheimer. Paris 1928 ‚Äì 1932 Montparnasse (1931), oil on canvas, 41 x 33 cm Lipshitz took up residence in Montparnasse, Paris. He enrolled in the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re where studied under Antoine Bourdelle, onetime assistant to Rodin. In Paris he was initiated in the Modern Movement. Here he came into contact with the concepts of Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, Dadaism, Surrealism and Constructivism. In May 1929, with Rachel Lipshitz pregnant with their first child, he was forced to turn professional sculptor and abandon the Acad√©mie. He rented a studio in the rue Bardinet and some work was soon accepted for the Salon d'Automne of 1929, marking the beginning of his professional career. Also in 1929 he was able to visit first the studio of Ossip Zadkine, then Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi. His friend Nesto Jacometti also introduced him to the work of a circle of Jewish artists within the Ecole de Paris who would influence Lipshitz greatly: Chaim Soutine, Jules Pascin, Moise Kisling and Amedeo Modigliani. When Rachil Lipshitz returned to Cape Town in February 1930, Isaac remained in Paris for another two years, producing the body of work eventually shown at his first one-man exhibition in Cape Town in 1932. During these last two years he lived the life of a Bohemian, frequenting the Caf√© de la Rotonde and the D√¥me and gate crashing the annual Beaux Arts Ball. It was during this time he took up the soubriquet Lippy to distinguish himself from Cubist sculptor Jacques Lipchitz. Cape Town 1932 ‚Äì 1947 He returned to Cape Town in March 1932, settling in Barnett Street near the Company's Garden. He installed his studio in Castle Street, with painter Chistopher Williams and set about organising his first solo exhibition of sculptures and drawings, which was to take place at the Martin Melck House on 16 May 1932. He found vociferous opposition to the Modern Movement and critics, like Bernard Lewis writing for The Cape, dismissive of all that it produced. Lippy's exhibitions at Asbey's Galleries in 1934 and 1937 was subjected to a renewed assault by Lewis, but defended by younger critics, such as German sculptor Ren√© Graetz. Other artists such as Maggie Laubser, who had returned from Berlin strongly influenced by the German Expressionism, was similarly assaulted. That young artists felt compelled to defend Lippy's work was a first sign that they were organising themselves in opposition to establishment figures like Edward Roworth, then president of the South African Society of Arts. In 1936, the painter Gregoire Boonzaier returned from studies in London and felt compelled to take this further. The New Group Gregoire Boonzaier was born into the artist establishment in Cape Town. His father was D. C. Boonzaier, the cartoonist and connoisseur, and the family home was frequented by artists like Pieter Wenning, Gwelo Goodman and Moses Kottler; even Bernard Lewis the critic. He had exhibited at the Royal Academy, with the London Group and the New English Art Club. Instead of availing himself of these extraordinary credentials and ensconcing himself in the conservative establishment, he set out to organise young artists in order to exhibit independently of the South African Society of Artists. With the aid of painter Freida Lock, Boonzaier formed the New Group and organised its inaugural exhibition from 4 to 10 May 1938 at the Argus Gallery, Burg Street. This show featured paintings by Boonzaier, Freida Lock, Charles Peers, Enslin du Plessis, Terence McCaw, Alexis Preller, Florence Zerffi, Fran√ßois Krige, Maurice Hughes, Rhoda Kussel, Joyce Ord-Brown, R. J. Pope-Ellis and Graham Young. Moses Kottler, Ren√© Graetz and Lipshitz contributed sculptures. It was not just a matter of taste that divided the establishment from the New Group. The battle lines were being drawn by events in Europe, with official censorship of Modern Art in Nazi Germany and the opening of the Entartete Kunst (degenerate art) exhibition on 30 June 1937 in Munich. Lipshitz formed a working association with painter Cecil Higgs, exhibiting together at 52 Dorp Street, Stellenbosch, in September 1938, in collaboration with Ren√© Graetz and Maggie Laubser. They would exhibit again, with John Dronsfield, in 1940, 1941 and 1945. The animosity in art circles came home to Lipshitz when, in August 1939, Bernard Lewis criticised a nude by Higgs at a New Group in the Stellenbosch University Library, giving rise to its removal, over public protest. Moreover, in November 1940, Edward Roworth, then Director of Michaelis and the South African National Gallery, openly supported Adolf Hitler's suppression of modern art. Lipshitz attacked him in a speech to The People's Club, quoted in full in Trek on 7 November 1940. It was a resounding defeat for the traditionalists. Palm Studios The Palm Studio (1936), gouache, 32 x 43.5 cm David and Goliath (1948), monotype, 53 x 34 cm In 1932 Lipshitz had become friends with Expressionist painter Wolf Kibel and they leased premises at 18 Roeland Street, Cape Town, which they restored and named Palm Studios. They offered workshops and mentoring to younger artists like Gerard de Leeuw and Dorothy Leeb. Kibel and Lipshitz developed a technique of monotype printing. The monotypes were the first to receive widespread attention in South Africa, becoming sought after collector's items. In June 1934 they held their first joint exhibition at the studio. Financial problems eventually led to their eviction in May 1937, after which they took up space in Madeira House in Stal Plein, with Freida Lock, John Wright and Hetta Crouse. It was a serious setback for Kibel, who was ill with tuberculosis. He was to die on 29 June 1938. England 1947 ‚Äì 1948 Lipshitz left South Africa in May 1947, taking up a studio belonging to Lady Nicholson (daughter of Sir Lionel Phillips) in Glebe Place, Chelsea, London. He worked for six weeks and participated in the Gimpel Fils Summer Exhibition. After this he moved to 18 Ellersdale Road, Hampstead to prepare for a London debut, an exhibition to open at the Galerie Apollinaire in Litchfield Street on 12 April 1948. Lipshitz exhibited 25 carvings at this occasion. Despite being his first exposure to a mature, informed audience, the works were well received by Maurice Collis writing for Time and Tide, Colin MacInnes in The Observer and Vorticist painter Colin MacInnes. Lipshitz exhibited again at the A.I.A. Gallery, and at The Little Gallery, with Dolf Dieser. Part of the Galerie Apollinaire exhibition was shipped to Johannesburg, where an exhibition was held at Gainsborough Galleries. He also met sculptors Henry Moore and Jacob Epstein, spending some time with the latter in his studio. During a trip to Paris with friend Yankel Adler he met Jean Arp. In 1948 he visited the artist's colony at Zennor, in Cornwall, stayed with David Lewis and met the carver Sven Berlin. Lipshitz returned to Cape Town in November 1948. Cape Town 1949 ‚Äì 1967 The internationalist bent in South African art was to culminate in the establishment of a South African Branch of the International Art Club of Rome, with Maurice van Essche as chairman. Van Essche, Lipshitz, Cecil Higgs, John Dronsfield, Irma Stern, Jean Welz, Alexis Preller and Walter Battiss were invited to participate in the Art Club exhibitions in Turin and Rome in early 1949. As a result of the exhibitions in Italy, South Africa was invited to exhibit at the Venice Biennale in 1950. A committee convened by Minister of Education, Arts and Science, C. R. Swart and consisting of John Paris, Director of the South African National Gallery, Dr. J. W. von Moltke of the Michaelis School and Prof. F. E. J. Malberbe of Stellenbosch University selected Van Essche, Lipshitz, Higgs, Dronsfield, Stern, Maud Sumner and sculptor Elsa Dziomba to represent the country at the Biennale. The selection and published photographs of selected works sparked an uproar in the Afrikaans press, particularly Die Burger. The result was that the works went to Venice with the aid of private funds. John Paris, as Director of the South African National Gallery (SANG), moved to assert the institution's independence and orient acquisitions policy away from the British School and towards South African art. The SANG acquired two Lipshitz works: Tree of Life (1950) in November 1950, and Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1946) in March 1959. Graphic works were purchased in 1954, 1959 and 1962. Rupert Shepard, Director of the Michaelis School, offered Lipshitz a post, which he assumed in 1950. In 1952 he was chief advisor to the SANG for the exhibition The Meaning of Sculpture. His works were acquired by other major collection in Southern Africa, and in June 1964, he was awarded the medal for sculpture by the Suid- Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns, followed in October 1964 by an Associate Professorship at Michaelis. Lipshitz emigrated to Israel in 1978, where he died in 1980.

Route description  The road is part of State Route 76, which connects the coastal suburb of Trigg, Western Australia, with the Swan Valley in the east. Morley Drive runs through the following local government areas City of Stirling, City of Bayswater and City of Swan. The entire road is controlled by Main Roads Western Australia for its entire length, and is designated as part of the Karrinyup-Morley Highway (H28). Morley Drive commences at a traffic light intersection with Main Street on the boundary of Balcatta and Tuart Hill, with Morley Drive continuing from Karrinyup Road west of the intersection. further east, Morley Drive meets Wanneroo Road and then travels along the suburbs of Nollamara and Yokine for before intersecting with Flinders Street. The road is now within the suburb of Dianella, travelling through said suburb for , intersecting with Dianella Drive, Grand Promenade, Alexander Drive and The Strand. The former two intersections are standard traffic light T-junctions, while the intersection with Alexander Drive and The Strand (north-west and south-east) is designed as a hamburger roundabout. At Camboon and Wellington Roads, Morley Drive heads over into the City of Bayswater and the suburb of Morley. The roads runs through the suburb for , intersecting with McGilvray Avenue and Crimea Street, before ending at a roundabout interchange at Tonkin Highway. Morley Drive, and State Route 76, continue as Morley Drive East to Caversham and the Swan Valley.  History  Morley Drive was first built during the 1970s to service the then-new inner northern suburbs of Perth. Before then, North Beach Drive was the main route to the coast in the west, as well as some similar situations in Morley, with Morley Drive being mostly discontinuous. Upon the opening of the road, which made the whole road continuous, the existing roads that were affected were made into discontinuous local roads. Also of note was Grand Promenade being cut off from what is known today as Dianella Drive. During the late 1980s, the six-way roundabout with Alexander Drive and the Strand was converted into a hamburger roundabout, resulting in The Strand becoming discontinuous. Morley Drive represented the northern terminus of the section of Tonkin Highway north of the Swan River from 1984 until 1989, when it was extended further north to Benara Road (Tonkin Highway became continuous in 1988). Apart from minor modifications, Morley Drive remained relatively unchanged until 2010, when the terrain of the eastbound carriageway near McGilvray Avenue was lowered to improve road safety around that area. 2016, the Flinders Street intersection was upgraded with longer turning lanes and better pedestrian facilities. Between 2016 and 2018, as part of the NorthLink WA road project, the intersection with Tonkin Highway was upgraded to a roundabout interchange with Tonkin Highway free-flowing over Morley Drive, a first in WA.

Statistics South Africa asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five racial population groups. The 2011 census figures for these categories were Black South African at 76.4%, White South African at 9.1%, Coloured South African at 8.9%, Asian South African at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%. Statistics South Africa provided five racial categories by which people could classify themselves, the last of which, \\"unspecified/other\\" drew negligible responses, and these results were omitted.Census 2001 , Statistics South Africa. The 2010 midyear estimated figures for the other categories were Black at 78.4%, White at 10.2%, Coloured at 8.8%, Indian/Asian at 2.6%. The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; it declined to 16% in 1980. Black South Africans The majority population of South Africa are those that classify themselves indigenous Black South Africans, Africans or Black people of South Africa, but they are not culturally or linguistically homogeneous. The major ethnic groups include the Zulu, Xhosa, Bapedi (North Sotho), Batswana, South Ndebele, Basotho (South Sotho), Venda, Tsonga, and Swazi, all of which predominantly speak Southern Bantu languages. Black South African's ethnicities native distribution is also found across countries neighbouring South Africa. The Basotho are the majority ethnic group of Lesotho. The Batswana ethnic group constitute the majority of the population of Botswana. The Swazi ethnic group is the majority ethnic group in Swaziland. The Tsonga ethnic group is also found in southern Mozambique, they are also known as the Shangaan (Shangana, Shangane or Shangani). Black African Black African as a population and ethnic representation in South Africa is a catch-all reference to the majority of Black South Africans, minority of Black South Africans, and all expatriate Black people from other African countries who are in South Africa. It is important to note, Khoisan South Africans are the minority of Black South Africans that complete the context of \\"Black South Africans\\" or complete the context of the indigenous South African population, but others among them do not classify as Black South African, but identify as 'Coloured Africans' and a number of expatriate Khoisan in South Africa classify as 'Other'. Demographics As of the calculations of 2004, there are 34,216,164 Black Africans and 8,625,050 Black African households residing in South Africa. The African population density is 29/km2. The density of Black African households is 7/km2. Black Africans make up 79.0% of the total population. The percentage of all African households that are made up of individuals is 19.9%. The average Black African household size is 4.11 members. In South Africa, the Black African population is spread out, with 34.0% under the age of 15, 21.6% from 15 to 24, 28.3% from 25 to 44, 11.8% from 45 to 64, and 4.3% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age of an Black African is 21 years. For every 100 Black African females there are 91.1 Black African males. For every 100 Black African females age 18 and over, there are 86.2 Black African males. With regard to education, 22.3% of Black Africans aged 20 and over have received no schooling, 18.5% have had some primary, 6.9% have completed only primary school, 30.4% have had some high education, 16.8% have finished only high school, and 5.2% have an education higher than the high school level. Overall, 22.0% of Black Africans have completed high school, and 59% of Africans, aged 25 to 64, have an upper secondary education as their highest level of education.

Black African males have a median annual income of ZAR 14,162 versus ZAR 8,903 for Black African females.Unemployment, race and poverty in South Africa Coloured South Africans The Coloured population is mainly concentrated in the Cape region, and come from a combination of ethnic backgrounds including Indigenous South Africans, Whites, Griqua and Asians. It is important to denote that this ethnicity is not by default to people of multiracial heritage in South Africa, therefore many multiracial South Africans do identify by any ethnic heritage they may be from i.e. Blacks, Whites, Asians etc., in the same matter, some people with little or no multiracial heritage do identify as a Coloured ethnic. However, during Apartheid this ethnicity was by law anyone who is of multiracial heritage or determined to be Coloured by the government. This ethnicity doesn't necessarily have an ethnic language nor of specific race but they are contemporarily South African cultured and rather stem their traditional and historical identity from the sense of community of Coloured people, e.g. Cape Coloureds. They are not all culturally or linguistically homogeneous but many from those who identify as Coloured usually speak Afrikaans as a first language. In detail, Coloureds descend from indigenous African people (South African Bantu-speaking peoples, South African Khoisan (mostly those who lived in the Cape Peninsula) and Africans not of South African descent), Griqua multiracials, European groups (mainly Dutch and British) and Asian groups (Javanese, Malay, Indian, Malagasy and other concerned Asian ethnicities) mainly of slaves brought in South Africa. Khoisan refers to two separate groups. The Khoikhoi, who were called Hottentots by the Europeans, were pastoralists and extensively integrated into the colonial economy, many converting early to Christianity; the San people, called Bushmen by the Europeans, were hunter-gatherers. The Khoisan groups as a minority completes the rest of the indigenous South African population and it is also found that others do not classify themselves as Black South African, African or even Black African. In the 2011 census for example, the overwhelming majority of the San community in Platfontein originating from the northern parts of Namibia and southern Angola opted to be classified as 'Other' and many from those claiming to be descendants of Namaqualand Khoikhoi classify themselves as Coloured. Within the Coloured community, more recent immigrants will also be found i.e. Coloureds from the former Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); Namibia and immigrants of mixed descent from India (such as Anglo-Indians) who were welcomed to the Cape when India and Burma received their Independence. In 2008, the Pretoria High Court has ruled that Chinese South Africans who arrived before 1994 are to be reclassified as Coloureds. As a result of this ruling, about 12,000‚Äì15,000 ethnically Chinese citizens who arrived before 1994, numbering 3%‚Äì5% of the total Chinese population in the country, will be able to benefit from government BEE policies.We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese, The Times Ethnic groups, 2001‚Äì2011 (Numbers are millions of people; horizontal scale is percentage of total population). White South Africans Europeans in South Africa are predominantly descendants of Dutch, German, French Huguenots, English and other European settlers. Culturally and linguistically, they are divided into Boers, who speak Afrikaans, and English-speaking groups. The white population has been on the decrease due to a low birth rate, emigration and as a factor in their decision to emigrate, many cite the high crime rate and the discriminatory affirmative action policies of the government. Since 1994, approximately 400,000 whites have permanently emigrated. Despite high emigration levels, immigrants from Europe have settled in the country. By 2005, an estimated 212,000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. By 2011, this number may have grown to 500,000. Some European Zimbabweans emigrated to South Africa. Some of the more nostalgic members of the community are known in popular culture as \\"Whenwes\\", because of their nostalgia for their lives in Rhodesia \\"when we were in Rhodesia\\". Despite high emigration levels, a high level of non-South African white immigrants have settled in the country, in particular from countries such as Britain and Zimbabwe. For example, by 2005, an estimated 212,000 British citizens were residing in South Africa. Since 2003, the numbers of British migrants coming to South Africa has risen by 50%. An estimated 20,000 British migrants moved to South Africa in 2007. There have also been a significant number of White Zimbabwean arrivals, fleeing their home country in light of the economic and political problems currently facing the country. There have been other white immigration waves to South Africa in recent decades. In the 1970s, many Portuguese residents of African colonies such as Angola and Mozambique came to live in South Africa after the independence of those nations. In addition, the apartheid government encouraged Central European immigration in the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly from Poland and Hungary. In Eastern Europe, particularly from Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Armenia Demographics As of the census of 2001, there are 4,293,638 Whites and 1,409,690 White households residing in South Africa. The White population density is 4/km2. The density of White households is 1.16/km2. Whites make up 9.6% of the total population. The percentage of all White households that are made up of individuals is 19.1%. The average White household size is 3.05 members. In South Africa, the White population is spread out, with 19.0% under the age of 15, 15.1% from 15 to 24, 31.0% from 25 to 44, 23.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.1% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age of a White is 35 years. For every 100 White females there are 94.0 White males. For every 100 White females age 18 and over, there are 91.1 White males.

Asian South Africans The major part of the South African Asian population are descendants from India with an estimated population of 1.2 million or 2.5% of the South African population (see Indian South Africans); many of them descended from indentured workers brought in the nineteenth century to work on the sugar plantations of the eastern coastal area then known as Natal. There is also a significant group of Chinese South Africans (approximately over 300,000 individuals) and Vietnamese South Africans (approximately 50,000 individuals). Asian South African extends to those of Japanese, Korean, Pakistani and many other South Africans of Asian descent. The majority of the Indian population came to South Africa as indentured labourers to work in the sugar plantations in Natal in the late 19th and early 20th century. They came from different parts of the Indian subcontinent, adhered to different religions and spoke different languages. Others however came independently for work purposes and business interests.

The case was important regarding repressed and recovered traumatic memories because being a well-documented study, it had the potential to provide evidence for the existence of the phenomena. The case served as an educational example of childhood sexual abuse and recovered traumatic memory for several years, until further investigation by Elizabeth Loftus and Melvin J. Guyer revealed serious concerns about its background and validity. The original article appeared in Child Maltreatment in 1997, accompanied by a series of articles by five additional psychologists and memory experts: Paul Ekman, Stephen Lindsay, Ulrich Neisser, Frank W. Putnam, and Jonathan W. Schooler, giving their own comments and interpretations about the case.  Background = First interviews  Forensic psychologist David Corwin first interviewed Jane Doe in 1984 at age six, in order to evaluate sexual and physical abuse claims by her father and stepmother, allegedly committed by Jane's biological mother. At the time of these interviews Jane‚Äôs parents were going through a custody battle, and both accused each other with wrongdoings such as tax fraud, failing to comply with visitation orders and physical abuse of the children. In the absence of conclusive evidence about these allegations, Corwin was left to decide about their credibility, believing the father‚Äôs version and discarding the mother‚Äôs. Corwin met Jane Doe three times as a child, videotaping the conversations with her, using the tapes and transcriptions as the basis of his analysis and evaluation of the abuse. Six- year-old Jane stated on the videotapes several times that her mother repeatedly abused her, but it was evident that this was not the first time she was asked to talk about what happened, raising the possibility for previous suggestions that could have influenced her. She reported instances of digital penetration while the mother was bathing her, and other physical abuse such as hitting her, pulling her hair, and burning her feet on the stove. On the basis of these interviews, Corwin concluded that the mother was abusing Jane Doe, and as a result she lost custody over her daughter, including visitation rights.  Second interview  The second interview took place eleven years later, when Jane Doe was seventeen. After her father and step-mother separated, she lived with her father until he became seriously ill and died. She was now living with a foster mother, and had some relationship with her biological mother. Jane wanted to see the old tapes because she was having trouble remembering what had actually happened. Corwin interviewed her in the presence of the stepmother. She did not have any memories of the abuse such as the foot-burning episode, but she remembered the interviews and the accusations. However, after further questioning Jane recalled some memories about a single episode in the bathtub, being hurt by her mother. Although still unsure whether her mother intentionally hurt her or not, the memories seemed vivid and powerful. She also recalled accusing her mother of taking pornographic photographs of her and her brother, and selling these. The origin of this recollection is uncertain, but as it was not documented previously, it is likely to be a false memory coming from other sources or suggestions. During the meeting, Corwin showed the old videotapes to Jane. After watching the tapes, Jane was reluctant to believe that she would have lied as a child, and concluded that her mother must have hurt her.  Interpretations  Corwin used the videotape and the transcript for educational purposes about childhood sexual abuse since the first interview, with consent given by Jane Doe‚Äôs father. The second session was later added and consent from Jane was acquired. The recollection about the bathroom episode in the second interview was interpreted by Corwin as a repressed and recovered traumatic memory, and the case-study was published in the psychological journal called Child Maltreatment in 1997. Several other psychologists (Paul Ekman, Stephen Lindsay, Ulrich Neisser, Frank W. Putnam and Jonathan W Schooler) also commented on the case in the journal, mostly in agreement with Corwin‚Äôs interpretation, and with some criticism from Neisser and Lindsay. After publishing this article, the Jane Doe case became influential, frequently used as an example in psychology and law, as an evidence for the repressed memory phenomenon.  Further research  Loftus and Guyer, skeptical of Corwin‚Äôs evidence, conducted extensive research about the case, which involved finding the family through legal databases, as well as talking to friends and relatives. They found additional information that Corwin omitted, indicating that the full story was more complicated than originally thought. They revealed details about the custody battle between the parents, which escalated to a point where both the father and the mother have been sentenced to short periods as a result of mutual accusations, with the situation eventually leading to the sexual abuse allegations. They also discovered that the marks on Jane‚Äôs feet and hand, serving basis for the claim that her mother burned her feet on the stove, were probably a result of a previous skin infection that looked ambiguous. They also found a clinical psychologist report, which doubted the sexual abuse at the time, and a documented Child Protection Services investigation, that did not find reason to take action against the mother. In addition, they found evidence of the father being a problem drinker and abusive towards Jane‚Äôs older brother.  Consequences  After the research and the interviews with the family members, Loftus and Guyer ascertained that Jane‚Äôs mother did not abuse her daughter and that the case was based on false premises. Jane Doe became convinced that the abuse happened, after Corwin showed her the eleven-year-old videotapes. She broke all contact with her biological mother, and complained about invasion of privacy at the University of Washington where Loftus worked as a professor. The university started an investigation about the research, which went on for nearly two years hindering the publication of the findings that had great importance for the public. When Loftus and Guyer were eventually able to publish the case (2002) in the Skeptical Inquirer magazine, Jane Doe filed a civil suit against Loftus (Taus v. Loftus) and others involved in the research, revealing her real name (Nicole Taus) in the process. Most of her claims were dismissed as strategic lawsuit against public participation, and the lawsuit was settled in 2007.  Conclusion  The two part articles in the Skeptical Inquirer describing the underlying circumstances of the case presented quite a different picture from the abuse hypothesis published by Corwin in 1997. This alternative explanation was supported by considerable evidence, indicating that Jane Doe was not abused by her mother, and her allegations and ‚Äúmemories‚Äù were probably the result of suggestions and coercions from her father and step-mother.

Oscar Ratti and Adele Westbrook, husband and wife, wrote Aikido and the Dynamic Sphere shortly after they had achieved shodan rank in aikido, and a short stay in Japan. It is based largely on the teachings of Yasuo Ohara, founder of the New York Aikikai. The book has been praised for Ratti's many illustrations (over 1200); although it has been noted that they do not provide sufficient information for the purposes of instruction. The authors' system of numbering techniques and attacks (rather than using the Japanese terms, which can differ between styles) has been praised for its ingenuity in unifying aikido terminology. Westbrook's text focuses heavily on the moral aspect of aikido, dividing violent encounters into four ethical levels: # Unprovoked attack, in which the victim is assaulted without warning or reason. # Provoked attack, in which the victim insults or otherwise encourages the attacker to act. # Subjective self-defence, in which the defender fights back with the intent of harming the attacker. # Ethical self-defence, in which neither defender nor attacker are harmed. Another goal of the book is to explain the supposedly esoteric concept of ki in Western terms. Westbrook defines it as a \\"unity of mind and body - the fusion of... direction and action\\". The text has received criticism both for its emphasis and simplification yet it remains notable in that it was one of the first texts written by Western aikido practitioners to address these issues. It is a standard found in most aikido libraries, remaining in print and translated into many languages.

She has been awarded Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honor of India in 1971 for her civil services.  Early life  She was born to wealthy family of Mathuradas Goculdas and his wife, Premabai, in Bombay. Sumati was named Jamuna, after the sacred river associated with Krishna in Vrindavan. According to then contemporary customs in India, while still a young girl she was married to Shanti Kumar Narottam Morarjee, the only son of Narottam Morarjee, the founder of Scindia Steam Navigation Company, which later grew to be India's largest shipping firm.  Scindia Steam Navigation Company  She was included in the managing agency of the company in 1923 at age 20. Sumati built the company from humble beginnings parlaying a few vessels in the company and gradually developing it, till she assumed full charge of the company by 1946, managing over six thousand people. She was already on the board of directors, and her expertise in the shipping trade, developed over many years.

Life  Charles Frederick was the eldest son of Duke William the rich and his wife, Maria of Austria (1531-1581), a daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I. His early and unexpected death of smallpox at the age of 19 in Rome during a pilgrimage and Grand Tour left a deep mark in history. His death left his younger brother John William as heir apparent of the United Duchies. However, John William had a weak health and mental problems and would die without an heir. This led to the War of the J√ºlich succession, which led to Prussia acquiring its Rhine Province. If Charles Frederick had not died young, then perhaps none of this would have happened and the map of Europe might have looked very different today. Charles Frederick's tutor Stephanus Winandus Pighius created a literary monument for his pupil with his Hercules Prodicius, which became the first tourist guide to Italy. Charles Frederick was described as a firm, fun-loving and highly intelligent young man. He was among the guests of honor at the ceremony in St. Peter's Basilica to open the Holy Year of 1575. Pope Gregory XIII was very attached to his guest, as he hoped that the young Prince would later have a favourable effect on the neighbouring Protestant countries. A week later, the Pope honoured his guest by giving him a consecrated sword and hat, an honor that was otherwise reserved for Kings. When Charles Frederick died five weeks later, Gregory XIII personally paid the cost of a royal funeral and an enormous funeral procession. Charles Frederick was buried across from Pope Adrian VI, in the Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima, the church in Rome of the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. His magnificent grave monument was designed by his tutor Pighius, and executed by the sculptors Nicolas Mostaert and Gillis van den Vliete. It shows, among other things, a resurrection scene that alludes to the statue of Laoco√∂n and His Sons found in 1506. A second part of the monument, with the presentation of the consecrated sword and hat, now hangs in the vestibule of the church. The inscription there states that Charles Frederick had a precocious sense of piety and was brilliant despite his youth and knew many things and many languages.

It is a sitting class. This class includes Les Autres sportspeople. People from this class compete in the sport at the Paralympic Games. History A version of this classification first appeared in 1998 during the World Championships, when the sport's governing body decided to pilot a classification programme. At the time, there was a classification called W1, which was for all sitting archers. Sport This is a Paralympic archery classification. In 2000, BBC Sport defined this classification as \\"W1, spinal cord and cerebral palsy athletes with impairment in all four limbs.\\" In 2008, BBC Sport defined this classification was \\"ARW1: spinal cord and cerebral palsy athletes with impairment in all four limbs\\" In 2008, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation defined this classification was \\"The main difference between ARW1 and ARW2 is the amount of functional ability athletes have in their upper bodies.\\". In 2012, the Australian Paralympic Education Programme defined this classification as \\"ARW1 - spinal cord and cerebral palsy athletes with impairment in all four limbs\\" In 2010, World Archery defined this classification as: a tetraplegic archer in a wheelchair or comparable disability. The Telegraph in 2011 described this classification as: \\"Athletes shooting from wheelchairs\\" The British Council defines this classification in 2012 as: \\"These athletes have a disability that affects their arms and their legs.\\" This classification has a subclassification: ARW1-C. In 2010, World Archery defined this classification as: \\"Within ARW1, archers with a greater handicap could be allocated to a sport sub-class ARW1-C and be allowed to compete in facilitated rounds at national or development level competitions. Note: These archers can compete in a higher class internationally.\\"  Disability groups = Les Autres  One of the disability groups eligible to participate in this class is people defined as Les Autres. = LAF1 = LAF1 classified athletes compete in ARW1. Sportspeople in this class use wheelchairs on a regular basis as a result of reduced muscle function. ACSM's Primary Care Sports Medicine defines LAF1 as a medical class as \\"[s]evere involvement of the four limbs -- for example, MS, muscular dystrophy (MD), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) with contractures\\" As a functional class, ACSM's Primary Care Sports Medicine defines LAF1 as \\"use of wheelchair with reduced function of muscle strength and/or spasticity in throwing arm, and poor sitting balance.\\" Medically, this class includes people with severe multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with contractures. This means they have severe issues with all four limbs. In terms of functional classification, this means the sportsperson uses a wheelchair, has poor sitting balance and has reduced strength or spasticity in their throwing arm. = LAF2 = LAF2 classified athletes compete in ARW1 or ARW2. Sportspeople in this class use wheelchairs on a regular basis as a result of reduced muscle function. They have low to moderate levels of balance issues while sitting, but maintain overall good balance from that position. They have normal arm function. Medically, this class includes people with severe hemiplegia, and paralysis of one limb while having deformations in two other limbs. Functionally, this means they have severe impairment of three limbs, or all four limbs but to a lesser degree than LAF1. In terms of functional classification, this means the sportsperson uses a wheelchair, has moderate sitting balance, reduced limb function in their throwing limb but has good sitting balance while throwing. Events At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, this classification was known as W1. Events eligible for this classification included W1 Comp Men, W1/2 Women and team. In the W1 Comp Men competition, archers qualified from Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Great Britain, Italy, Korea, Switzerland and the Ukraine. For the W1/2 Women's competition, archers qualified from Canada, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Japan, Turkey and the Ukraine. The World Archery Para Championships are the major international event for this classification. In 2011, it was held in Turin, Italy and served as a qualification competition for the 2012 Summer Paralympics. Events for this classification included Individual Compound Men W1, in addition to team events using either a compound bow or a recurve bow. For the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the men's individual compound qualifying score for the event set by FITA and the International Paralympic Committee was 1150+ FITA score and 720 Round Score of 575+. For the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the men's individual recurve qualifying score for the event set by FITA and the International Paralympic Committee was 1100+ FITA score and 720 Round Score of 550+. Only one man from the United States was able to qualify for the 2012 Paralympics at the 2012 U.S. Paralympic Team Trials. For the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the women's individual recurve qualifying score for the event set by FITA and the International Paralympic Committee was 1000+ FITA score and 720 Round Score of 450+. At the 2012 Paralympics, this classification will compete in the \\"Olympic round format at a 122cm target from a distance of 70m\\". For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, archery classification was scheduled for September 7 and September 8 at Sambodromo. Equipment Their wheelchair can be higher than from the bottom of the armpit of an archer. Archers in this class \\"are allowed to use simultaneous protrusion and strapping. They may use any wheelchair and amount of body support/strapping to maintain body stability as long as no support is given to the bow arm whilst shooting.\\" In this class, archers are allowed to use compound bows in competition. Men are restricted to a maximum draw of and women are restricted to . Archers are allowed to have an assistant who can knock their bow for them. The assistant must be wearing the same uniform colour and number as the archer they are working with. Becoming classified Classification is handled by FITA ‚Äì International Archery Federation. FITA has an Ad Hoc Committee dedication to classification, which is led by Chief Classifier Pauline Betteridge. This committee is in charge of determining classifications, providing materials about classifications and training people to classify archers. World Archery classification is done by at least three people. One of them must have a medical background. On the national level, there only needs to be one classifier. Archery classification is done by medical professionals. In classifying an archer, the classifiers look for the range of movement and strength of the archer's arms, legs and back.

Signs and symptoms Symptoms of the condition in males consist of loss of libido, impotence, infertility, shrinkage of the testicles, penis, and prostate, diminished masculinization (e.g., decreased facial and body hair growth), low muscle mass, anxiety, depression, fatigue, vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes), insomnia, headaches, and osteoporosis. In addition, symptoms of hyperestrogenism, such as gynecomastia and feminization, may be concurrently present in males. In females, hypoandrogenism consist of loss of libido, decreased body hair growth, depression, fatigue, vaginal vasocongestion (which can result in cramps), vasomotor symptoms (e.g., hot flashes and palpitations), insomnia, headaches, osteoporosis and reduced muscle mass. Symptoms of hypoestrogenism may be present in both sexes in cases of severe androgen deficiency (as estrogens are synthesized from androgens). Causes Hypoandrogenism is caused primarily by either dysfunction, failure, or absence of the gonads (hypergonadotropic) or impairment of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland (hypogonadotropic), which in turn can be caused by a multitude of different stimuli, including genetic conditions (e.g., GnRH/gonadotropin insensitivity and enzymatic defects of steroidogenesis), tumors, trauma, surgery, autoimmunity, radiation, infections, toxins, drugs, and many others. Alternatively, it may be the result of conditions such as androgen insensitivity syndrome or hyperestrogenism. More simply, old age may also be a factor in the development of hypoandrogenism, as androgen levels decline with age. Diagnosis Diagnosis of androgenic deficiency in males should be based on symptoms together with at least two measurements of testosterone done first thing in the morning after a period of not eating. In those without symptoms testing is not generally recommended. Androgen deficiency is not usually a checked for diagnosis in healthy women. Treatment Treatment may consist of hormone replacement therapy with androgens in those with symptoms. Treatment mostly just improves sexual function in males. Alternatively, gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH)/GnRH agonists or gonadotropins may be given (in the case of hypogonadotropic hypoandrogenism). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stated in 2015 that neither the benefits nor the safety of testosterone have been established for low testosterone levels due to aging. The FDA has required that testosterone pharmaceutical labels include warning information about the possibility of an increased risk of heart attacks and stroke.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. History At the end of the 19th century, the availability of iron ore from the Upper Peninsula caused shipping traffic through the Great Lakes to increase tremendously. Martin Reef, only a few inches deep in its shallowest area, was a significant hazard for ships approaching the Straits of Mackinac. In 1896, the Lighthouse Board asked for funds to be allocated to construct a lightship to station at the reef. However, despite repeated requests, it was not until 1906 that Congress approved the request. Plans were drawn up to construct a lightship designated LV89. In 1907, the Racine-Truscott-Shell Boat building Company of Muskegon, Michigan was awarded a contract to build the steel-hulled vessel. The vessel was completed in 1908, but was not stationed on the reef until the beginning of the 1909 shipping season. However, over the next few decades, ships in the Great Lakes became larger and larger, and extended the shipping season past the times that LC89 was able to stay on station due to winter ice. In the 1920s, the Lighthouse Service began designing a permanent structure to replace the lightship on Martin Reef, and soon funds were allocated for construction. Work was started in the summer of 1927, and once the pier structure was complete, a temporary light was rigged and LV89 was removed and stationed at North Manitou Shoal in Lake Michigan. The entire project was completed in the summer of 1927. In 1939, the Coast Guard assumed responsibility for the nation's lighthouses. They installed electric generators at Martin Reef to power the light. At some point, the station was automated, and the original Fresnel lens was removed and replaced with a acrylic optic. The original lens is on display at the museum at the Point Iroquois Light. In 2000, the ownership of the light station was turned over to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In January of 2020, the ownership of the light station was turned over to the Martin Reef Light Historical Preservation Society Inc. Description The Martin Reef Lighthouse sits on a square concrete-filled crib, placed in at the southeast edge of the reef. The crib is the base for a pier containing cellar storage areas for coal and water. Additional concrete forms an external \\"wave flare\\" around the pier, and the resulting pier structure is approximately high from its base. The lighthouse itself is a square, white, three-story structure made of a skeletal steel frame covered with reinforced concrete and iron and sheathed with steel. The lighthouse is centered on the crib. The first floor of the lighthouse was designed as an engine room, the second floor as an office, kitchen, and living area, while the third floor contained sleeping rooms. A square, watchroom sits on the top of the lighthouse, topped with an octagonal cast iron lantern with a red roof. The lantern originally contained a flashing white fourth order Fresnel lens manufactured by Sautter & Cie of Paris. It currently contains a 200 mm acrylic lens. The lighthouse also contained compressed air diaphone fog signal. The Poe Reef Light, built in 1929, is a duplicate of this lighthouse.

In December 1944 he again returned to Australia and was promoted to lieutenant colonel before taking command of the signals unit attached to the I Australian Corps, which was subsequently involved in the amphibious landings on Tarakan, Labuan and Balikpapan against the Japanese during the Borneo Campaign in 1945. Following the end of the war Vincent held a number of senior appointments in the Signal Corps, including as Director of Signals between 1954 and 1958. As a colonel he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List on 12 June 1958 in recognition of his service to the Australian Staff Corps. Promoted to brigadier in 1962, he commanded the Australian Army Force in the Far East Land Forces, headquartered in Singapore, during which he gained an understanding of the situation in Vietnam. He commanded the 1st Task Force between 1963 and 1965, and was involved in preparing infantry battalions prior to their deployment to Vietnam. In mid-1966 he was promoted to major general and assumed command of the 1st Division.. Vincent took over as Commander, Australian Force Vietnam (COMAFV) in Saigon on 29 January 1967 from Major General Ken Mackay, a former classmate at Duntroon, due to the latter's illness.. During his period in Vietnam the size of the Australian force in Phuoc Tuy Province grew significantly and he was instrumental in the eventual deployment of Centurion tanks to the theatre, while he also approved the deployment of the 1st Australian Task Force out of the province in late-1967 and its use in helping to disrupt the Viet Cong Tet Offensive in January 1968. Vincent was replaced as COMAFV on 30 January 1968.. During 1968 and 1969 Vincent was posted to Washington, D.C. as head of the Australian Joint Service Staff. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1969. Returning to Australia in 1970 he served on the Military Board as Adjutant-General until he retired in 1973. Retirement In his later years Vincent remained interested in military issues and was the defence advisor to the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) from 1975 to 1993 and the chief commissioner of the RSL Australian Forces Overseas Fund. A qualified military pilot, he took a keen interest in the development of Army Aviation and became honorary colonel of the Australian Army Aviation Corps. In 1994 he was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours for his service to the veterans community. He died unexpectedly at his home in Canberra on 8 October 1995, aged 79. He was survived by his wife Margaret and their three children and three grandchildren.

Fearing for his life, Le Gastelois felt compelled to leave Jersey to live on the small island six miles to the north east of Jersey, having been treated as a criminal and ostracised by many who lived on Jersey. Ten years later, on 10 July 1971, the real criminal, Edward Paisnel, nicknamed the Beast of Jersey, was caught and on 29 November 1971, was sentenced to jail for 13 attacks; this ended an 11-year reign of terror.  Early life  Le Gastelois was born on the island of Jersey to French parents. His father was from Besneville and his mother from Montgardon. He studied at St Martin's School.  Suspicion and arrest  In a documentary, a journalist described how Le Gastelois liked to roam the country lanes at night. Stan de la Haye of the Honorary Police described Le Gastelois as a loner who wore a dirty old raincoat tied up with a piece of rope ‚Äì thus matching the description of the wanted man. Unfounded grudges against Le Gastelois were formed in fear, and fueled by the local police force in Jersey not speaking out to silence gossip. As the hysteria reached fever pitch, Le Gastelois' unconventional lifestyle led him to become one of 30 suspects arrested during an investigation by Scotland Yard. He was released after 14 hours of questioning due to a lack of evidence. His clothes were sent for forensic examination at Scotland Yard, and on release he was issued with ill-fitting clothes. Unlike the other suspects, Le Gastelois' name was released to the public, and he became a scapegoat. The attacks of the Beast of Jersey continued unabated. Public suspicion against Le Gastelois remained so strong, however, that his cottage was burnt down in an act of arson.Histoire des Minquiers et des Ecr√©hou, Robert Sinsoilliez, St Malo 1995, In the documentary, Le Gastelois said that the police had searched his house 12 times in 12 months.  Exile  In 1961, Advocate Denys Richardson took Le Gastelois out to the reef in his boat, where Le Gastelois took on some work refurbishing the hut belonging to Advocate Richardson, and doing odd jobs for other hut owners. He described his life on the reef as \\"paradise compared to what I've been through.\\"  Reclusive life on the reef  From May 1961 until April 1975 and despite Paisnel's capture, Le Gastelois continued to live a quiet life of solitude on the islet of La Marmoti√®re, explaining that he had become so used to it and it was his home with all his possessions there with him. His story became a cause c√©l√®bre and the bearded character soon established himself as the \\"King of the Ecr√©hous\\" and became an attraction for those visiting the reef.Jersey Witches, Ghosts & Traditions, Hillsdon, Norwich 1987, The huts on the reef have no running water nor electricity. During the bitterly cold winters, there would be no visitors to the islands for months at a time. To survive, he lived off the land as best he could, becoming expert at finding lobsters in the expanse of rock pools at low tide. He collected rain water, and his diet also included seaweed and seagull eggs. Visitors to the reef would often bring him supplies and books from Jersey. He said in an interview that he did not like the fish but preferred the seaweed. To keep warm he would pull two tables together, cover them with a blanket to make a tent and then light a candle or small fire inside it.  King of the Ecr√©hous  Exonerated, Le Gastelois remained on the √âcr√©hous where he formed the firm conviction based on what he had read in the law books given to him by visitors that the archipelago could become an independent entity since they were not permanently occupied. He claimed that status pursuant to Norman law in force since Rollo in 911, which provides that a person can claim possession of a deserted place if he lives there for 10 years. His request was formally submitted to the Queen, not as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland but in her capacity as Duke of Normandy. His request was unsuccessful and the √âcr√©hous remained a possession of the Bailiwick of Jersey.  Accusation of arson  After Le Gastelois lived for 14 years as a hermit, in 1975 a posse of officials from Jersey went to the reef to exterminate rabbits which were said to be destroying what little vegetation existed there. As they were returning to Jersey, the biggest building on the reef, a hut belonging to Lady Trent, caught fire and was destroyed. The rabbits were a source of food for Le Gastelois, who was arrested and accused of lighting the fire as an act of revenge. He was imprisoned for 3 months on remand, but at his subsequent Royal Court trial he was unanimously acquitted by the 24-strong jury who took just minutes to reach their 'not guilty' verdict.  Return to Jersey  Despite saying that he had no reason to go back to Jersey, Le Gastelois did not return to the √âcr√©hous and remained in Jersey from 1975 until his death in June 2012. He moved into a single room at the rear end of a cottage in Dumaresq Street, St. Helier owned by the States of Jersey. He mostly kept himself locked in. He suffered severe back pain which impaired his ability to walk very far. Having received no pension he was living in extreme poverty. Later he lived at Victoria Cottage Homes for 3 years, then Guardian Nursing Home for another 3 years and then the last 18 months of his life at Palm Springs nursing home.  Interviews and documentary  Le Gastelois gave an interview to Channel Television in 1964 and to the Jersey Evening Post in 1966. In 1998, he was the subject of an award-winning 24-minute documentary.  Proposed compensation  In 1999, The States of Jersey debated a proposition brought by Senator J.S. Rothwell to pay Le Gastelois ¬£20,000 in compensation as a token of support to redress the injustice that he had suffered. In a BBC interview, he was quoted as saying \\"What can you do? You can't rebuild my life, you can't rebuild me. I don't want much now, only want to be left in peace.\\" He said of the proposed compensation: \\"It's a bit late in life but it will help.\\" The Finance and Economics Committee presented written comments to the States, expressing their sympathy for Le Gastelois' circumstances but in their opinion paying compensation could establish a precedent. After the States voted in favour of holding the debate in camera, Senator Rothwell withdrew his proposition.  Family  Le Gastelois never married, and he left no children. His nephew William Du Heaume and wife Valerie Du Heaume along with their family still live in the island as does William Du Heaume's brother Ernest and his two sons. Valerie Du Heaume looked after him when his health failed. She has called for the States of Jersey to make a public apology, and for a memorial to him to be placed on the reef.  Memorial  Amongst the many friends that attended his funeral were 9 expert mariners from Normandy who had been amongst Le Gastelois' most frequent visitors during his exile, including Alain Blancheton, former harbourmaster of Carteret who gave the eulogy. Shortly after Le Gastelois' death, a Facebook group was set up to gain public support for a suitable memorial. St Martin's honorary police also expressed interest. The Facebook group has suggested \\"Wrongly Accused; forgive us\\" as a suitable epitaph. A letter to the editor of the Jersey Evening Post suggested that Jersey Heritage which each year commissions a portrait of one of the Island's well known citizens should select Le Gastelois as its next subject. Theatrical performance Scriptwriter Andrea Earl has written a play about Le Gastelois' life. It was performed for the first time at Jersey Opera House on 28 October 2014, the month being the 100th anniversary of his birth.

The route runs along the Saar to Sarreguemines. History  A treaty was contracted between Prussia and France to build the border crossing at Sarreguemines on 18 June 1867. The line was completed in 1869, but since the connecting line from Sarreguemines to Hagenau was still under construction, the first locomotive ran over the Prussian bridge between Hanweiler and Sarreguemines on 23 May 1870. On 1 June 1870 the line was officially opened in the presence of German and French government officials. A Prussian and French military band played together in Saarbr√ºcken station. A few weeks later, on 16 July 1870, the last passenger train ran from Sarreguemines, subjected to stone-throwing by the French during the lead up to the Franco-Prussian War. The line was originally intended to be part of a longer line, running from Brussels to Basel via Saarbr√ºcken. After the Franco- Prussian War 1870-1871, this plan lost its importance as the Luxembourg‚ÄìMetz‚ÄìBasel railway line was now entirely under German control. In the 1940s there was an express service between Cologne and Strasbourg on the line, but the line has never had much significance for long distance traffic. On 20 June 1960, the line was one of the first lines in the Saarland to be electrified, when it was electrified to Brebach station. On 11 September 1981 electrification was extended to the border near Hanweiler-Bad Rilchingen. As of September 1983 electric operations were extended to platform 1 of Sarreguemines station. As the rest of the station is not electrified, it can be run on the German catenary supply system without changing voltage. The second track between Hanweiler and Saargem√ºnd was removed because of the narrowness of the Prussian Bridge. Since 1997, the line has been operated as part of the Saarbahn Stadtbahn service; Regional-Express services also run between Saarbr√ºcken and Strasbourg. A B√ºbingen Nord station was planned originally on the line between the stations of B√ºbingen and G√ºdingen. This was shown on the line map, but was abandoned because of its cost. Route Starting at Saarbr√ºcken station, the line runs at first parallel with the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn) to Saarbr√ºcken-Ost station. This halt is only served by trains on track 1 to 2 and is not a scheduled stop any longer for trains on the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìSarreguemines line, which uses track 4. Here the line branches off to the south. In 1997, a connection was built from the Saarbahn (the Saar's Stadtbahn) line from R√∂merkastell to the Saarbr√ºcken‚ÄìSarreguemines line between Saarbr√ºcken Ost and Brebach. Until 1945, there was also a siding from the Palatine Ludwig Railway to R√∂merkastell, but this was not rebuilt after the destruction of a road bridge during the war. Brebach station is still responsible for the operation to the Halberg iron works (Halbergerh√ºtte). Stadtbahn sets are parked on the extensive network of rail tracks there. Until the 1990s, there was a siding from Brebach to the R√∂merbr√ºcke power station, the wholesale market, and some private businesses. Reactivation of this line is now under discussion. A railway bridge was built over the River Saar in 1975, especially to connect to the German operations centre of Peugeot in the G√ºdingen/Unner district. By the autumn of 2005, all of these sidings had been dismantled except for the siding to the Halberg iron works. The Saar bridge was closed in 2003. View of Sarreguemines, on the left is track 1 electrified with the 15 kV overhead system of Deutsche Bahn After Brebach the line runs in viewing distance of the Saar. The station building at G√ºdingen was demolished in 2006. There were also some sidings in B√ºbingen, which were abandoned in 2007. Kleinblittersdorf station has been rebuilt in recent years and a third terminating track has been installed, which can also be used by Saarbahn trains in coupled sets. The former station building is now privately owned. The new platforms were moved a few metres to the south and combined with a modern bus station. Here, too, former private railway sidings have now been dismantled. The lime works of Saarstahl (Saar steel) is in Auersmacher, which is served more than once a day by trains carrying lime to V√∂lklingen. A small diesel locomotive is still based there especially for shunting. Hanweiler station operates as a border station, but it has now lost most of its tracks. The line becomes a single track before the station and crosses the Saar and the border with France over the Prussian bridge. The line ends at platform 1 of Sarreguemines station. Rail services The focus of operations on the line is local and regional traffic in the Upper Saar. Traditionally, for decades there were also several express services each day between Saarbr√ºcken and Strasbourg. Today the line is used by Saarbahn services. The regional traffic from Saarbr√ºcken to Strasbourg via Saargem√ºnd is operated with identical Alstom Coradia LINT diesel multiple units by Deutsche Bahn (class 641) and SNCF (Class X 73900). The formerly extensive freight operations (mainly coal trains to France) is confined to and from the Halberg iron works and the Halberg-Guss company in Brebach. In addition, several times a day broken slag is carried from the Saarstahl underground mine in Auersmacher to V√∂lklingen.

Henrik Fexeus at Jack Reacher premiere  The TV host  Fexeus television appearances often deal with the same psychological topics as his books. He has appeared in both his own programs and already established program formats. * In 2007-2009 Fexeus wrote and performed the 16 episode TV special Mind Storm, which aired on Swedish Television. This was his first major public appearance (along with the book The art of reading minds the same year). In Mind Storm, Henrik performed psychological experiments on people who were often not aware that they were participating in an experiment. These experiments formed the basis for a further discussion of human behavior with different psychological experts. Reporter in Mind Storm was Charles Franz. Mind Storm has also been shown in Norway, Denmark and Finland and was one of the programs that represented SVT at the television Fair INPUT in Johannesburg in 2008. * In 2010 Henrik Fexeus led seven episodes of the discussion program Theme: at the Knowledge Channel, also for SVT's behalf.Theme: discussed such diverse topics as entrepreneurship, dyslexia and cancer. * In 2011 Fexeus was a jury member on Sweden's Got Talent on TV4, along with Bert Karlsson and Charlotte Perrelli. Fexeus task was to assess the participants' body language and stage presence. * In 2013 Fexeus hosted the video blog Headquarters, along with journalist Susanne Delastacia. Headquarters ran for 13 episodes and produced by United Screens. * In 2014 Henrik Fexeus was back at SVT with the program Love Code. The format was developed by Endemol and was met with some criticism when it was broadcast. * During Almedalsveckan 2014, Fexeus was the body language expert for TV4 and P4 with Lotta Brom√©. In TV4 Nyhetsmorgon was part of a panel that included Marcus Oscarsson and Elaine Eksv√§rd, where his job was to review the political party leaders' body language and nonverbal communication during their interviews. In P4 he was similarly analyzing the party leaders, based on their public speeches. * Henrik Fexeus continued to be a part of TV4 Nyhetsmorgon's election coverage until the elections in 2014, where he examined the party leaders' body language in the final debates. His collaboration with Nyhetsmorgon continued in 2014 to the spring of 2015, where he presented weekly psychological experiments to demonstrate human behaviour. * Between February 2015 and January 2017, Henrik Fexeus was a distinguished panel member of the radio show Dilemma, broadcast by Mix Megapol every Saturday and Sunday. Dilemma was led by television profile Anders S Nilsson and presenteds problems submitted for the panel to resolve. In addition to Henrik, the most common panelists were Josefin Crafoord and Thomas J√§rvheden, but Claes Malmberg, Martin Timell and Tobias Karlsson has also visited the program. * In 2016, Henrik analysed the body language of the US presidential candidates during the campaign period for Aftonbladet TV. *Henrik hosted the podcast \\"Kan Sj√§lv: En podcast om varf√∂r vi √§r som vi √§r\\" (\\"By myself: A podcast about why we are the way we are\\") 2017-2018, produced by NENT media group, in 30 episodes. *During the Swedish election of 2018, Henrik analysed the non-verbal communication of the Swedish political party leaders for SVT's morning news show MorgonStudion.  The lecturer  Since 2005, Henrik Fexeus gives talks based on his books. His lectures deal with non-verbal communication, relationship-building, and \\"mental super powers\\". Henrik lectures in Swedish and English all over the world, e.g. in Norway, Mexico, Finland and Spain.

It is separated from Hiddensee by the narrow B√§k, only 120 metres wide in places. It forms the western part of the border between the Schaproder Bodden and the Vitter Bodden. The island is 1.23 km long and up to 580 metres wide. It has an area of ca. 37 ha. Ferry services between R√ºgen and Hiddensee used to run via F√§hrinsel. It was closed in 1952 when the port at Schaprode was upgraded to handle mailboat services. F√§hrinsel is a nature reserve and out-of-bounds to visitors. It is a roosting place for thousands of birds and the grazing area for a herd of Gotland sheep.  Geography  Juniper - a typical shrub on F√§hrinsel F√§hrinsel consists of a fan of several berms, up to 2 metres high, and spits, as well as silted-up areas of the lagoon, the Schaproder Bodden. About 12,500 years ago, during the last cold phase of the ice age, glacial ice masses piled up sand and gravel. When the ice retreated, the Dornbusch on Hiddensee, as well as two ridges of glacial till running westwards from R√ºgen, belonged to a vast Young Drift landscape in the southern Baltic Sea region. One ridge formed the heights of the island of Ummanz and the Gellen peninsula, another ran between Trent via the present Stolper Haken near Seehof northwards from Schaprode to the F√§hrinsel. Following the flooding of the region around R√ºgen and Hiddensee about 3,900 years ago, the aforementioned end moraines remained behind as islands. Not until much later (2,900 years ago) did abrasion begin, mainly as a result of breakers. Numerous spits and bars formed and Hiddensee was given its elongated shape. The block of till between R√ºgen and F√§hrinsel was eroded and, at some point, it must have been breached. When the remaining cliff section on the F√§hrinsel was abraded, southward running spits formed due to the currents from the northeast flowing past both sides of the northern tip of the island. The narrow bays, lagoons and runnels (Riegen) between the spits slowly filled with organic material and silted up. F√§hrinsel is covered by a dense growth of juniper on the old berms. Between the berms an undergrowth of heather has developed. Reeds and salt meadow vegetation grows in the silted-up zones. In the lagoons, sedge and bog plants predominate. On the eastern shore of the island, a flint field, about 150 metres from north to south and about 20 metres wide, indicates that there was formerly a cliff here. Of historical interest is a triangular set of ramparts in the southeast, the Swedish or Old Rampart (Schwedenschanze or Alte Schanze). This guarded the strait between the Stolper Haken and F√§hrinsel. At that time this was the first sea inlet on an approach from the north; the peninsula of Bug and the Bessin were not as long as they are today. At the Stolper Haken is a counterpart of the rampart on the F√§hrinsel. Headlands on the F√§hrinsel are the M√∂venort, no longer recognizable as a spit in the central region, and the Buschort, its southern tip. In the centre is a frequently-flooded salt meadow landscape, the Roschen, which is only 40 cm above the level of the Baltic Sea. Off the island to the southeast is the island of Bullenriff, which measures only 85 by 80 metres, and is sometimes called Kuhwerder. The name indicates that it used to be intensively grazed. It is, like the Roschen, very flat and only covered by typical salt meadow vegetation.  Bird world  Despite the loss of several breeding species (including oystercatchers and ruff, and reductions in the populations of others, F√§hrinsel still has high importance as a breeding area. This is partly due to the fact it remains out of bounds and partly because of its special landscape. Shelduck nest between the juniper bushes nest and it is one of the most important breeding sites for red-breasted merganser in the Hiddensee area. On the Roschen there are breeding colonies of many black- headed, common and Mediterranean gulls. teal also breed here. The ruff is an example of the extinction of a bird species on Hiddensee. Even in the 19th century it still occurred in the salt meadows south of Kloster and on F√§hrinsel in stable numbers. But around 1940/1950 it died out as a result of egg stealing by foxes and people. The common tern and Sandwich tern, which until about 1970 occasionally bred here, are no longer seen. Songbirds on the island include the skylark, white wagtail and red-backed shrike. During migration periods between March and May and between September and November, waders and ducks gather in large numbers on the meadows and in the shallow bodden waters. Despite its not very exposed location, F√§hrinsel is occasionally a stopover for various vagrants. Between 28 June and 10 July 1971 one to four gull-billed terns were observedDittberner, Hoyer: Die Vogelwelt der Inseln R√ºgen und Hiddensee ‚Äì Teil I ‚Äì Nonpasseres. p. 168 and on 28 May 1985 an adult rosy starlingDittberner, Hoyer: Die Vogelwelt der Inseln R√ºgen und Hiddensee ‚Äì Teil II ‚Äì Singv√∂gel. p. 137 from central Asia and Southeast Europe stayed on the island.

Biography  Entering the Acad√©mie Julian in 1906, painter, draughtsman and lithographer Henri Sollier, born in Bagnolet, near Paris, on 7 December 1886, graduated to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1908, and worked in the ateliers of Fran√ßois Flameng, and, after 1910, of Fran√ßois Schommer. In spring 1919 he celebrated the victory of the Allies with two eloquently titled paintings, Pour elle! and Par elle !, which he exhibited at the Devambez Gallery in Paris. After the interruption of the First World War a fruitful decade ensued of prizes and awards, enabling him to undertake extensive travels.  Trip to Senegal  In 1920 his first participation at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais achieved a Mention Honorable, together with the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts Prix Leclercq-Maria Bouland; the following year the Prix de l‚ÄôAfrique Occidentale Fran√ßaise brought him a travel grant. Sollier set off immediately for French West Africa, to spend three years in Senegal, sending portraits of indigenous peoples ‚Äì Wolof and Bambara women ‚Äì to the Pavillon de Marsan and the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, and colourful and exotic market scenes from Dakar. From these bustling centres of trade Sollier brought back portraits of merchants from neighbouring lands, such as the Maure au chapelet, submitted to the 1923 Salon.  Between exoticism and regionalism  On return in 1924 Sollier reserved his African canvases for his regular admirers at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, while at the Salon d‚ÄôAutomne, as a newcomer, he presented two paintings in settings more familiar to the public: Les tilleuls and Le porche de Chartres. The painter cultivated two themes, the exotic and the regional, at least until 1935, regularly exhibiting canvases inspired by Africa at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© Coloniale des Artistes Fran√ßais. One of these recalls his secondary activity as an illustrator, exemplified in his poster design for the 1925 Exposition Agricole in Dakar and Saint-Louis. Ten years later Sollier took part in the first Salon de la France d‚ÄôOutre-Mer (Salon of French Overseas Territories, Paris, Grand- Palais), and in a group show organised in Brussels by the Soci√©t√© Coloniale des Artistes Fran√ßais. The year 1929 marked Sollier's discovery of Brittany: a stay in Douarnenez, Finist√®re, won this Africa specialist's heart: the landscapes and deeply traditional people of Brittany offered a different kind of exoticism from his African sojourn.  Joining the Naturalist painting  Sollier did more than just capture the picturesque motifs found in the landscapes of Brittany; he also painted realistic portraits of its inhabitants. In Solitude, winner of a silver medal at the 1930 Salon, Sollier demonstrated his conversion to the naturalist style of the day. His uncompromising portraits of a Breton women echoe the social realism of Jules Adler, whose academy Sollier frequented in parallel to his courses at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In the 1934 Salon Les a√Øeux won a gold medal. The composition's compact organisation intensifies the frontal dialogue between the protagonists, who bear a certain family resemblance to the kin of Jean-le- Boiteux, a peasant from Plougasnou (Finist√®re) portrayed by Jean-Fran√ßois Raffa√´lli in 1876. The coppery skin tones and broad brushstrokes that convey the humble condition of Sollier's A√Øeux are close to the manner of his contemporary Lucien Simon. Simon's work focused on the Bigouden area of Brittany and showed a strong ethnographic content, as in Procession √† Penmar‚Äôch. Taking up the mantle of Courbet‚Äôs realism, Lucien Simon and his fellow artists popularised Breton subjects in Paris at the turn of the century.  Sollier in Brittany  In 1933 he went to B√©nodet and Sainte- Marine, where Simon continued to paint at the top of the semaphore tower he had been using as a studio since 1902. So had another former member of the Bande noire, Andr√© Dauchez, whose views of Finist√®re are close to Sollier's landscapes from the same period. The two artists evince a similar approach to light, sometimes intense, sometimes muted, following variations in the weather. However, Sollier was often more subtle than his older colleague, and his Brittany landscapes from the 1930s are noteworthy for the delicacy of their unusual pastel effects. From Sainte-Marine, Sollier pushed on to Cornouaille, stopping at Pont-l'Abb√©, Loctudy, Lesconil and Penmarc‚Äôh, where Lucien Simon painted his Procession. In 1935 Sollier went north to Camaret- sur-Mer, a small fishing port on the Crozon peninsula. The place had been popular with painters ever since Eug√®ne Boudin‚Äôs repeated visits there between 1874 and 1880. Among them, Charles Cottet and Georges Lacombe left strongly contrasting representations of the site. Sollier's painting of the rocks at Camaret are a long way from Lacombe's symbolist vision.  Towards new horizons  Finist√®re was Sollier's favourite part of Brittany, but he also spent time in the Morbihan and along the C√¥tes d‚ÄôArmor. There he painted scenes of everyday life, which he exhibited regularly at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais. This longstanding fidelity was rewarded by the success of his Brittany paintings both with the public and with the judges at the Salon, who awarded him a gold medal at the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques (Paris) in 1937. That same year Sollier was made a committee and jury member of the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais, a distinction to match the degree of his public and official recognition. During the 1940s, without leaving Brittany, Sollier began to explore new genres and new places. He twice tried mythological painting, immediately winning the Prix James Bertrand for his Hommage √† Phidias at the 1944 Salon. The following year he returned to this genre with Naissance d‚ÄôAphrodite. This departure from his Breton repertoire was continued by landscapes from the Seine-et-Marne and Burgundy, with a deliberate detour to the village of Murols in Auvergne, which had witnessed whole colonies of landscape artists, from Th√©odore Rousseau to Victor Charreton. He died in 1966 in Paris, brush in hand.  Works in public institutions  * La rue descendante, 1928.

By August 1897, the Spanish military forces under Governor-General of the Philippines Fernando Primo de Rivera drove General Emilio Aguinaldo‚Äôs revolutionaries to the hills of Biak-na-Bato, Bulacan. Pressured by the need to divert military resources to the Cuban War of Independence because of a threatened intervention by the United States, Primo de Rivera resorted to peaceful negotiations and the mobilization of a non-Tagalog people local militia, Voluntarios Locales, in the event the negotiations failed. The enthusiastic response to the formation of the Voluntarios Locales de Bacolor on November 17, 1897 foreshadowed the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14, 1897.Togores Sanchez, Luis E.

While the Congress was in session, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1898) ceding the Philippines to the latter for $20 million on December 10, 1898. The treaty was yet to be ratified by the US Congress and therefore did not impede the assembly from completing its task. The Constitution of the First Philippine Republic, otherwise known as the Malolos Constitution, was completed and approved on January 20, 1899. Among the more contested provisions of the charter was the separation of church and state. The provision's passage by a margin of one vote was largely attributed to the vigilance of the freemasons.Calderon, Felipe G. Mis memorias sobre la revoluci√≥n filipina: segunda etapa, 1898 √° 1901.

On the same day, the president and the Council of Government (Cabinet of the Philippines) headed by Apolinario Mabini as Presidente (Prime Minister of the Philippines) signed a decree covering the release of all Spanish prisoners not pertaining to the regular army, the disposition of Spanish-owned properties, and the expulsion of the Spanish clergy.Philippines. Gobierno Revolucionario, 1898. p. 123. On January 26, Mabini issued a memorandum appointing the members of the Commission on Prisoners of War to implement the decree.

Liongson was assigned to General Antonio Luna's command in view of mounting cases of insubordination, desertion and opportunism. After the fall of Malolos on March 31, 1899, Liongson, the Judge Advocate, wrote to the Secretary of War on April 6 from Calumpit sending a list of the men and officers ordered arrested by Luna and punished for misdemeanors he thought were violative of military discipline.Agoncillo, Teodoro A.

The death sentence was invoked, but at the petition of the defence was ultimately accorded a sentence of twelve years imprisonment with demotion.\\"Artigas Cuerva 1917. p. 827. On June 5, 1899, Gen. Antonio Luna and his aide, Col. Francisco Roman were killed by members of the Kawit Battalion whom Luna disarmed and arrested during the Battle of Caloocan. On the same day, Aguinaldo assumed overall command of the Central Luzon forces.Joaquin, Nick. A Question of Heroes. Philippines: Anvil Publishing Inc. 2011 pp. 195‚Äì196. Col. Liongson was recalled to the General Headquarters in the town of Tarlac, Tarlac by then the seat of a government on the move. Retreat and surrender Conventional warfare proved to be unsustainable for the Philippine army. Endangered by encircling American forces in his last seat of government at Bayambang, Pangasinan, Aguinaldo issued directives disbanding the regular forces and commencing guerrilla warfare on November 12, 1899. By November 12, 1899, General Arthur MacArthur, Jr.'s forces seized Tarlac when guerrillas began to harass, sabotage and ambush Americans by raids on supply trains, patrols and small detachments.Gates, John Morgan. Schoolbooks and Krags: the United States Army in the Philippines, 1898-1902. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press 1973 pp. 156-179. Subjected to these harassments in Tarlac was the 9th Infantry Regiment (United States). Tipped by an informer, a detachment including US Medal of Honor recipient Lt. Edgar F. Koehler attacked the village of Tinuba six miles north of Tarlac on March 4, 1900. 150‚Äì160 villagers were rounded up and 29 suspected insurrectos, including Col.

Unlike modern designs, air-blast injected Diesel engines do not have an injection pump. A simple low-pressure fuel-feed-pump is used instead to supply the injection nozzle with fuel. At injection, a blast of compressed air presses the fuel into the combustion chamber, hence the name air-blast injection. The compressed air comes from compressed-air tanks which feed the injection nozzle. A large crankshaft-driven compressor is used to re-fill these tanks; the size of the compressor and the low rotational frequency of the engine's crankshaft means that air-blast injected Diesel engines are huge in size and mass, this, combined with the problem that air-blast injection does not allow for quick load alterationR√ºdiger Teichmann, G√ºnter P. Merker (publisher): Grundlagen Verbrennungsmotoren : Funktionsweise, Simulation, Messtechnik , 7th issue, Springer, Wiesbaden, 2014, , p. 381. makes it only suitable for stationary applications and watercraft. Before the invention of precombustion chamber injection, air-blast injection was the only way a properly working internal air fuel mixture system could be built, required for a Diesel engine. During the 1920s,R√ºdiger Teichmann, G√ºnter P. Merker (publisher): Grundlagen Verbrennungsmotoren : Funktionsweise, Simulation, Messtechnik , 7th issue, Springer, Wiesbaden, 2014, , p. 382. air-blast injection was rendered obsolete by superior injection system designs that allowed much smaller but more powerful engines.Anton Pischinger, Otto Cordier: Gemischbildung und Verbrennung im Dieselmotor, Springer, Wien, 1939, , p. 1 Rudolf Diesel was granted a patent on air-blast injection in November 1893 (DRP 82 168).Rudolf Diesel: Die Entstehung des Dieselmotors, Springer, Berlin 1913, , p. 21  History  The air-blast injection system was first used by George Bailey Brayton in 1872 for a two-stroke gas engine. Rudolf Diesel wanted to build an engine with direct injection for which he tried using accumulating in 1893.MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG: Leistung und Weg: Zur Geschichte des MAN Nutzfahrzeugbaus.Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg, 1991, . p. 440 Due to the highly viscous fuels Diesel used and thermal afterburning occurring, the principle of accumulating did not work sufficiently. Therefore, Diesel had to improve the injection system. German engineer Friedrich Sass says that Diesel knew about Brayton's invention and that it is therefore very likely that Diesel decided to replace his own inferior injection system with an air-blast injection system similar to Brayton's.Friedrich Sass: Geschichte des deutschen Verbrennungsmotorenbaus von 1860 bis 1918, Springer, Berlin/Heidelberg 1962, , p. 414 Diesel did so in February 1894, because he could not come up with a better solution, however, Diesel wanted to replace the air-blast injection system with a superior system ever since; an improved accumulating system which allowed for direct injection without a huge compressor was patented by Diesel and Rudolf Brandstetter in 1905.MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG: Leistung und Weg: Zur Geschichte des MAN Nutzfahrzeugbaus.Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg, 1991, . p. 417 Nevertheless, this improved system was still insufficient and Diesel considered direct injection without a huge compressor ‚Äûunfeasible‚Äú. It took another ten years for the first working direct injected Diesel engines which were not air-blast injected to show up in 1915; the precombustion chamber, which made motor vehicle Diesel engines possible, had been invented in 1909.Friedrich Sass: Bau und Betrieb von Dieselmaschinen: Ein Lehrbuch f√ºr Studierende. Erster Band: Grundlagen und Maschinenelemente, 2nd issue, Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg, 1948, , p. 94 & 95  Design = Atomiser design  Initially, sieve-type amtomisers were used for the injections nozzles, until the sieves were widely replaced by discs. Also, ring-type atomisers were used for some engines.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 270 The ring-type atomiser is based on the principle of different air velocities occurring inside the nozzle, which force the fuel to mix up with air.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 271 Disc-type atomisers have small perforated discs placed above each other with small gaps in between (as seen in Fig. 6 in the sectional drawing on the right). The discs are slightly misaligned to increase constriction. Depending on the capacity of the engine and, therefore, quantity of injected fuel, either two, three or four dics are used per injection nozzle. The disc material depends on the fuel type. In general, bronze casting and phosphor bronze casting are used; for engines running on coal tar, the discs are usually made from steel.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 265 For engines with disc-type atomisers, the injection pressure should be in sync with the rotational frequency of the crankshaft. This means that with an increase in rotational frequency, the air pressure must be increased as well. Usually, at injection, 97% air and 3% fuel are getting injected through the injection nozzle.MAN Nutzfahrzeuge AG: Leistung und Weg: Zur Geschichte des MAN Nutzfahrzeugbaus.Springer, Berlin / Heidelberg, 1991, . p. 419 The injection pressure is between 5 and 7 MPa which limits the rotational frequency. Also, with increasing engine load, the injection pressure must be reduced to prevent misfire.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 269 Neither disc hole diameter calculation nor the proper size of the discs were known engineering knowledge at the beginning of the 20th Century. The disc designs were usually based on the engineers' experience. While big holes require a lot of compressed air and therefore consume more engine power, holes being too small reduce the engine power output. Julius Magg recommends a disc hole diameter depending on the indicated cylinder power output: D^2= 0,2 N. D is the hole diameter in millimetres, N is the power output in PS.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 274  Nozzle layout  In the early 20th Century, two different injection nozzle designs for air- blast injected engines were common: The open nozzle and the closed nozzle design.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 261 The closed nozzle design was the initial and most common design, it is usually found in vertical engines (such as the Langen & Wolf engine as seen on the right). It can be used for both two- and four- stroke engines. The injection nozzle is supplied with fuel from the fuel-feed- pump while constantly being fed with compressed air from the compressed-air tank. This means that the fuel-feed-pump has to overcome the resistance caused by the injection-air-pressure. A separate cam on the camshaft (as seen in Fig. 5 and on the two-cylinder Johann-Weitzer-engine on the right) would activate the injection valve so the compressed air would then press the fuel into the combustion chamber. Before the injection valve opens, neither fuel nor compressed air can enter the combustion chamber.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 263 The closed nozzle design allowed for a good air-fuel-mixture at the time which made it very useful for high capacity engines. This also resulted in lower fuel consumption compared to the open nozzle design. Biggest disadvantages were the higher manufacturing cost and the injection nozzle restrictions that made designing engines with horizontal cylinders considerably difficult,Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 280 since in horizontal cylinder engines, compressed air can easily enter the cylinder without pressing a sufficient quantity of fuel into the combustion chamber which leads to engine misfire or postignition.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 268 The open nozzle design was mostly used for engines with horizontal cylinders and unusual for engines with vertical cylinders. It can only be used for four-stroke engines. Like in the closed nozzle design, the fuel is fed to the injection nozzle. However, the injection valve only prevents compressed air from entering the cylinder; the fuel constantly enters a prechamber above the combustion chamber in the cylinder. Between prechamber and combustion chamber, the disc-type atomisers are placed to separate the chambers from each other. At injection, the compressed air would then press the fuel through the disc-type atomisers into the combustion chamber.Julius Magg: Die Steuerungen der Verbrennungskraftmaschinen, Springer, Berlin, 1914, , p. 275 Manufacturing engines featuring the open nozzle design was considerably cheaper and easier than making them with a closed nozzle design. It also allows for using tar as fuel. However, fuel supply is insufficient and at the beginning of the injection, too much fuel enters the combustion chamber which causes too much pressure buildup inside the cylinder. This, as well as the problem that it is impossible to supply high capacity engines sufficiently with fuel, means, that the open nozzle design can only be used for smaller engines.

Based on a story by Gerald Geraghty and George Sherman, the film is about an army sergeant and former rancher who runs into opposition from local ranchers when the United States Army sends him to purchase their ranch land needed for a strategic air base.Magers, pp. 141‚Äì143. Plot The United States Army sends Sergeant Gene Autry (Gene Autry), a rancher in civilian life, to negotiate the purchase of ranch land out West needed to build a strategic air base. Local ranchers, led by Gabby Whittaker (George \\"Gabby\\" Hayes), refuse to sell their land to the government. After some investigation, Gene suspects that the ranchers' refusal to sell their land may be influenced by borax mine magnate Stevenson (Jonathan Hale), who wants more money than the government is offering for his Atlas Borax Mine. To prevent ranchers from selling their land to the army, Stevenson and his men embark upon a plan of sabotage that makes it appear that the army fliers are employing ruthless tactics to force the ranchers into selling. Influenced by Stevenson's covert agitation, the ranchers are driven to armed resistance when Gabby's nephew Jimmy (Billy Lee) is killed in an explosion caused by Stevenson. As the ranchers prepare to barricade the town, Gene rides to the rescue with proof that Stevenson was responsible for the explosion and the sabotage. Angered by the treachery, the ranchers, led by Gene in an armored truck, ride to the Atlas Borax Mine and bring Stevenson and his gang to justice.

In 1923, Lithuania invaded the territory and annexed it. As part of Lithuania, in 1926, the then four Catholic parishes were separated from the Diocese of Ermland (renamed Warmia in 1945), which it had been a part of since 1820. Since the area was small, and had few Catholic residents, it was not given a bishopric, but a territorial prelature. The prelature was vacant between 1939 and 1949 (when the Bishop of Ermland functioned as Apostolic Administrator), and after 1975. In contrast to the rest of Lithuania, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the area of Klaipƒóda is, like much of East Prussia was until 1945, mostly Lutheran. In 1940, just 12,000 (7%) of the inhabitants were Catholic. By 1990, the number had doubled in all major cities due to migration (including moves and deportation after the Second World War) of the former populations, and immigration of Catholic Lithuanians.

In both paintings, Stanzione has dispensed with the halo and palm leaf, omissions that are common in Neapolitan painting of the 1600s. Although lacking the traditional external signs of sainthood, her status as one of God's elect is evidenced in the raised head and upturned eyes, an open mouth, and the hand with fingers spread over the heart. The block of stone closing off a corner of the composition is a device commonly used in Neapolitan painting of this century. However, in the case of Saint Agnes, the stone block also serves to represent the altar on which the Agnus Dei, or sacrificial lamb is placed. Stuck to the back of the canvas are some lines of poetry in English in praise of Saint Agnes, cut from printed matter which looks like it might be from the nineteenth century or earlier.

He was born in Plze≈à, Austria-Hungary and emigrated to Sioux City, Iowa with his widowed mother at the age of five. Knott started working at The Dallas Morning News in 1905. He drew daily cartoons in the paper during Woodrow Wilson's first presidential campaign and World War I. Knott's most famous cartoon character \\"Old Man Texas\\" was a champion for government honesty, low taxes and property ownership. It is believed his cartoons supporting American entry into World War I helped increase the sales of Liberty Bonds and donations towards the war effort. Knott's cartoons were reprinted in several publications including The Literary Digest, Review of Reviews, The Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, New York Evening Post, the New York Herald Tribune, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Philadelphia Public Ledger. Personal information It Shoots Further Than He Dreams by John F. Knott. War cartoon depicting the Kaiser shooting a canon labeled \\"Militarism.\\" First published on March 26, 1918. Knott was born in Pilsen, Austria to his father Francis Joseph and mother Anna Knott. At 5 years of age, he and his widowed mother moved to Sioux City, Iowa. When Knott was only 16, he published his first drawing for the Sioux City Journal. After much persuasion, he talked his mother into letting him go to Chicago, Illinois. This is where he was hoping to become a staff cartoonist with a newspaper but instead accepted to work as a cub draftsman for an architect. While working, he also took night classes at the Holmes School of Illustration. In 1901, Knott took up a job offer from a Sioux City engraver and he spent his first four years in Dallas, Texas illustrating harness and saddlery catalogs for White Engraving Company. He later met D. Prescott Toomey who was an artist and the managing editor of the Dallas Morning News. Toomey later offered Knott work as a full-time artist for the newspaper. Knott started his career with the News on December 1, 1905 where he would perform artistic duties and general illustration. Knott was losing hope for his talent to be recognized in Dallas. On January 1, 1906, he signed his first piece of artwork. Several years later, after realizing he needed more training and practice, Knott and his family moved to Munich, Germany. There he spent three semesters at the Royal Academy of Art and spent all of his money. He later accepted the job opportunity that the News offered him. In November 1911, Knott's work started to appear on the front page of the news. During Woodrow Wilson's first presidential campaign and World War I, Knott began drawing daily cartoons and attracted national and international attention. In 1957, Knott retired from the News. During his fifty-year career as a cartoonist, he created more than 15,000 cartoons. Knott taught painting in Dallas public schools for almost twenty years. Knott was a member of the Philosophical Society of Texas and the Texas State Historical Association. On February 22, 1907 Knott married Carrie Louise Bowen and together they had four children.

Mangano was particularly impressive against the then-10th ranked Florida Gators, scoring 26 points, grabbing 12 rebounds, blocking two shots, and making 4 of the 6 three-pointers that he attempted. The Bulldogs had an outside chance to claim the Ivy League title entering their final 3 games, but losses to Princeton and Penn prevented the Bulldogs from claiming the title.

At Google, although he worked for eight years in Engineering, on projects such as mobile search and leading search quality. Tan earned his eccentric Google title after starting ‚Äúmindfulness training‚Äù courses at the company ‚Äî a groundbreaking mindfulness-based emotional intelligence course called Search Inside Yourself, which was featured on the front page of the Sunday Business section of The New York Times in April 2014.

Mindfulness non-profits Motivated by his belief that happiness is a state of mind, these mindfulness training courses were meant to help Googlers find inner peace and clear their minds to manage stress and negativity. The classes proved extremely successful at Google, which led Meng to write a best-selling book, ‚ÄúSearch Inside Yourself‚Äù.

Now primarily derived from the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the original power to create Acts of Adjournal is derived from an Act of the Parliament of Scotland of 1672. Before promulgation, Acts of Adjournal are reviewed and may be commented upon by the Criminal Courts Rules Council. Following Scottish devolution and the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, Acts of Adjournal are made as Scottish Statutory Instruments. Before devolution, Acts were made as United Kingdom Statutory Instruments. History=Courts Act 1672 The Courts Act 1672 (originally Act concerning the regulation of the judicatories) created the High Court of Justiciary by attaching five Lords of Session to the Lord Justice General and Lord Justice Clerk. The Act provided that \\"the judges of that court [...] regulate the inferior officers thereof, and order every other thing concerning the said court,\\" a provision which remains in force and which created the distinction between Acts of Adjournal and Acts of Sederunt. In the 19th century, a reforming of the High Court of Justiciary made all Lords of Session ex officio Lords Commissioners of Justiciary. That reformation, while now repealed, is replicated by the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, which further provides that the Lord President of the Court of Session is to hold the office of Lord Justice General. Treaty of Union The Treaty of Union between Scotland and England, which formed the Kingdom of Great Britain, required that the High Court of Justiciary \\"remain in all time coming, as it is now constituted by the laws of the Kingdom of Scotland.\\" As a result, the Courts Act 1672 continues to be the original source of the Court's authority to regulate. However, in the time since, laws enacted by the Parliament of Great Britain, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the Scottish Parliament have expanded or elaborated upon the Court's power as is permitted by the Treaty of Union, which provides that the Court is \\"subject, nevertheless, to such regulations as shall be made by the parliament of Great Britain.\\" References Statutory law Scots law High Court of Justiciary ","title":"Act of Adjournal"},{"id":"36106389","text":"Critical understanding is a term used commonly in education to define a mode of thinking, described as, ‚Äòan essential tool for participating in democratic processes, at whatever level.‚ÄôDodds, H.

Yet it requires external manifestation in order to be communicated. The expression of critical understanding can take various forms including formal or informal speech, academic writing, creative prose or poetry or visual outcomes. It can take different forms in different cultures and this needs to be taken into consideration when assessing critical results.Charnock, K. (2010) The right to reticence.

Critical understanding is used to define the process of formulating and understanding a complex problem or difficult set of ideas.

Chicago and London: Chicago University Press In a pedagogical sense it is closely linked to the theory of Education for Critical Consciousness, outlined by Paulo Freire, Brazilian educator and critical theorist, who wrote, ‚ÄòOnly dialogue, which requires critical thinking, is also capable of generating critical thinking.

Approvals and indications In February 2017, Baricitinib was approved for use in the EU as a second-line therapy for moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults, either alone or in combination with methotrexate. In April 2017, Baricitinib received a complete response letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 2017. The letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its existing form. Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data were needed to determine the most appropriate doses and that additional data was necessary to further characterize safety concerns across treatment arms. On 23 April 2018, an FDA Advisory Committee recommended approval of baricitinib 2 mg for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis but did not recommend the 4 mg dose, citing serious adverse events.FDA Briefing Document ‚ÄîArthritis Advisory Committee Meeting On 31 May 2018, FDA approved Barictinib for the treatment of adult patients in the US with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to one or more TNF antagonist therapies. Contraindications During pregnancy, the use of baricitinib is contraindicated. Side effects In studies, upper respiratory tract infections and high blood cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolemia) occurred in more than 10% of patients. Less common side effects included other infections such as herpes zoster, herpes simplex, urinary tract infections, and gastroenteritis.  Interactions  Being metabolized only to a small extent, the substance has a low potential for interactions. In studies, inhibitors of the liver enzymes CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9, as well as the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin, had no relevant influence on baricitinib concentrations in the bloodstream. While baricitinib blocks a number of transporter proteins in vitro, clinically relevant interactions via this mechanism are considered very unlikely, except perhaps for the cation transporter SLC22A1 (OCT1). An additive effect with other immunosuppressants cannot be excluded. Pharmacology=Mechanism of action Baricitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that reversibly inhibits Janus kinase 1 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.9 nM and Janus kinase 2 with an IC50 of 5.7 nM. Tyrosine kinase 2, which belongs to the same enzyme family, is affected less (IC50 = 53 nM), and Janus kinase 3 far less (IC50 > 400 nM). Via a signal transduction pathway involving STAT proteins, this ultimately modulates gene expression in immunological cells. Other JAK inhibitors include tofacitinib, which is indicated for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis; fedratinib, and ruxolitinib. Pharmacokinetics The substance is quickly absorbed from the gut with an absolute bioavailability of 79%. It reaches highest blood plasma levels after about an hour; in different individuals the time to reach this level ranges from 0.5 to 3 hours. Food intake has no relevant influence on the drug's pharmacokinetics. 50% of the circulating baricitinib are bound to blood plasma proteins. Less than 10% of the substance is metabolized to four different oxidation products by CYP3A4; the rest is left unchanged. Elimination half- life is 12.5 hours on average. About 75% is eliminated via the urine, and 20% via the faeces. History=Clinical trials 31 clinical trials had been registered for baricitinib of which 24 had completed, and 4 of 6 phase 3 trials had completed. In April 2020, Lilly announced they were investigating the use of baricitinib for treating COVID-19 patients. The drug's anti- inflammatory activity is expected to act on the inflammatory cascade associated with COVID-19. Approval process In January 2016, Eli Lilly submitted a new drug application to the US FDA for the approval of baricitinib to treat moderately-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In December 2016, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended the approval of baricitinib as a therapy for RA. European approval was granted in February 2017. Despite widespread expectations that the FDA would approve baricitinib for RA, in April 2017, the FDA issued a rejection, citing concerns about dosing and safety. In May 2018, baricitinib was approved in the United States for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In March 2020, the US FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to baricitinib for the treatment of alopecia areata. Brand names In Bangladesh the drug is sold under the trade name Baricinix and Baricent (Incepta Pharma) among others.

There are several paths to the Board Certified Master Arborist, but typically on average each has been an ISA Certified Arborist a minimum of three to five years before qualifying for the exam (this can vary depending upon other education and experience). The certification began as a result of the need to distinguish the top few arborists and allow others to identify those with superior credentials. The ISA added specialty certifications of Utility Specialist, for those maintaining vegetation around electric utility wires, Municipal Specialist, for those with additional experience managing public urban trees. The Master Arborist examination is a far more extensive exam than the International Society of Arboriculture Certified Arborist Exam, and covers a broad scope of both aboriculture management, science and work practices. Another credential that is on a par with the Master Arborist is that of the American Society of Consulting Arborists, the Registered Consulting Arborist. There are perhaps six hundred individuals with that qualification, and only 70 arborists who hold both credentials. The ISA Board Certified Master Arborist exam covers virtually every area of aboriculture (other than consulting), with the following areas covered on exam.

Rana is based on the open source motion package for Linux, but has significantly enhanced motion detection capabilities. It has been designed top operate as an efficient camera trap system for recording the movements of small invertebrates, capable of operating autonomously in the field for extended periods. To date, Rana has been used a number of projects looking eusocial hymenoptera including studies of bumblebee and hornet activity in the vicinity of their nests and of the behaviour of hover flies and other pollinators at flowers and as a general purpose e-ecology tool for the automated remote observation of plant-pollinator interactions in the field.

In this case the movement of bumblebees in a colony is being monitored Here we see a typical Rana setup for observing bumblebees in the vicinity of their colony. The colony is mounted on cork stilts inside an outer (plastic) weatherproof housing. Bees are channelled in and out of the nest via a one way system. Each channel is monitored using a Philips Phillips SPC1330N autofocus USB camera which are connected to the Asus Aspire one data logging computer via USB 2.0 connections. This logging computer runs C code which implements a motion detector which is loosely modelled on the frog visual system (e.g. a blob detector which capable of detecting and tracking blobs of a user determined size). This motion code is running on top of a Linux kernel. This offers a relatively good real time performance on the relatively slow Atom N450 processor which was chosen to keep power consumption low (so the logger can operate stand-alone with solar panels in remote field locations). The data logger is connected to the outside world via 100 Mbit/second Ethernet (WIFI and a mobile phone dongle could be substituted in remote field locations). The system is controlled via a web interface on a remote monitoring computer, smart phone or tablet. With high end cameras like the [Phillips SPC1330N] or the [Logitech C270] it is possible to point and focus the cameras from the monitoring station too. Showing Rana blob detection. The extent of the blob (a moving bee) is shown by the bounding rectangle in addition to detecting moving blobs, the Rana system can also track the path of these blobs through its visual field. If required be split into a number of sub-fields within which blobs can be tracked independently. This permits a single camera to monitor a number of visual channels reducing system hardware complexity and expense. Subsequently, Rana has been ported onto a number of low power ARM based devices such as the Raspberry Pi and Odroid [C1] and [C2] which can be operated off the grid in remote field locations. Remote control of Rana (and live video streaming from the camera(s) monitored by Rana is accomplished via a web services interface. These systems have recently been used by researchers at the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew to monitor the activities of pollinators at floral patches both within Kew and also in the field in order to determine the pollinators of the rare Pasque Flower in the Chiltern Hills. In addition, it has also been used with near infra-red night vision cameras to monitor the activities of nocturnal invertebrates including cockroaches, moths and bed bugs. A recent [study ] by Red Butte Garden and Arboretum (University of Utah) has used the system to observe thousands of hours of plan-pollinator interactions in the Utah desert.

Early life Born Robert Flatow in Brooklyn, New York, to parents Lily Pendlebury and Julian Flatow, Thom graduated from Yale University in 1952 and became a Rhodes Scholar where he studied in Oxford for a year. Career He sold his first play, The Minotaur, to the Circle in the Square Theatre producers, Jos√© Quintero, Ted Mann, Emilie Stevens and Jason Wingreen, in 1954 and went on to establish himself as a young playwriting talent in the New York City theater scene. In 1957, he came to Broadway to work on Compulsion based on the book and play by Meyer Levin about the Leopold and Loeb case. It starred Roddy McDowall and Dean Stockwell and ran for 140 performances but Thom only received an assistant to the producers credit and 20% of Levin's royalties. He later worked on the screenplay for the 1959 film starring Orson Welles. He moved to the West Coast to work for MGM and wrote screenplays for youth films such as The Subterraneans, based on the novel by Jack Kerouac, and All the Fine Young Cannibals (both 1960) as well on others uncredited. He co- wrote the 1963 DuPont Show of the Week The Legend of Lylah Clare which was broadcast on NBC and later made into a 1968 movie. A week after the broadcast he won an Emmy for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Drama for a two-part episode of the TV series The Defenders called The Madman starring Sylvia Sidney and Don Gordon. Bicycle Ride to Nevada starring Franchot Tone opened on Broadway on September 24, 1963 but closed after just one day. Wild in the Streets, based on a short story written by Thom and originally published in Esquire under the title, \\"The Day It All Happened, Baby!\\" was an exploitation film success for American International Pictures in 1968. He directed his only film, Angel, Angel, Down We Go, in 1969 for AIP, which he also wrote. He also wrote several novels and had just finished Masquerade before his death. Personal life He was married to actress Joan Zell from 1953 to 1956; Zell committed suicide at Thom's home in 1961. He married actress Janice Rule in 1956; they had one daughter, Kate, before they divorced in 1961. Thom married actress Millie Perkins in 1964; they had two daughters, Hedy and Lillie, and were separated at the time of his death in 1979.

An oval upper terrace with embrasures facing the open sea served as the fort's site for the fort's battery. Today, the fort is a nature reserve for seabirds. History Fort de la Conch√©e In 1689 Vauban conducted an inspections of French coastal fortifications for King Louis XIV, who wished to strengthen and improve the country's defences. In 1693, whilst the fort was being constructed, the English raided the town. They landed on Conch√©e, where they slighted the works and captured those working on the fort. The English, with their Dutch allies, attacked the fortress again in 1695. Though the fort was unfinished, ten guns had been installed, which permitted the French to repulse the attack. The battery then turned its guns on the main attacking fleet, causing much damage to it. The fort was finally finished in 1705. The fortress was declared obsolete in 1889 and demilitarised in 1901. Conch√©e at low tide During the Second World War the Germans used the abandoned fort for target practice. The Allies then attacked the fort during St Malo's liberation.

Since 2004, this book has included a chapter on business courts, which describes changes and developments in business courts since that time to the present. Delaware's Court of Chancery, the pre-eminent court addressing intra-business disputes, has functioned as a business court of limited jurisdiction for a century. However, its traditional equity jurisdiction has evolved and expanded since 2003 to include technology disputes (10 Del. C. ¬ß 346), some purely monetary commercial disputes (10 Del. C. ¬ß 347), and to expand its role in the alternative dispute resolution of business and commercial disputes. This includes the use of mediation (10 Del. C. ¬ß 347), Masters in Chancery to adjudicate matters (10 Del. C. ¬ß 350), and agreements to make decisions non- appealable (10 Del. C. ¬ß 351).Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures The significant relationship between business courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution, such as mediation, neutral valuation, and arbitration, is well recognized.Christopher R.

In the United States, these courts have been established in approximately twenty-five states. In some cases, a state legislature may choose to create a business court by statute. In other cases, business courts have been established by judicial rule or order, at the Supreme Court or trial court level. In virtually all cases, the jurisdiction of the court to hear certain cases is limited to disputes that are in some way related to \\"business\\" disputes, and generally fall into two categories: (1) those courts which require that cases have an additional complexity component; and (2) those courts which establish jurisdictional parameters (i) through a defined list of case types (ii) combined with a specified minimum amount of damages in controversy, irrespective of complexity. There are courts with mixed models as well.* Mitchell L. Bach & Lee Applebaum, A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade , 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004). In New York, for example, the Commercial Division may hear cases (1) alleging breach of contract, (2) arising under the state's business corporation law, (3) arising under the state's partnership law, (4) relating to commercial loans, negotiable instruments, letters of credit, and bank transactions, or (5) involving business torts. The Commercial Division may not, by comparison, hear cases involving (1) landlord/tenant disputes, (2) commercial foreclosures, (3) products liability claims, or (4) claims alleging discrimination except when part of or under the terms of a contract.Section 202.70, Rules of the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York Some states have established specialized courts that include technology disputes as part of their express jurisdiction.Jacob A. Sommer, Business Litigation and Cyberspace: Will Cyber Courts Prove and Effective Tool for Luring High-Tech Business Into Forum States, 56 Vanderbilt Law Review 561 (2003) Through legislative effort and court rule, Maryland established a Business and Technology Case Management Program. In May 2003, Delaware expanded the Court of Chancery's jurisdiction to include technology disputes, and the mediation of other kinds of business disputes (10 Del. C. ¬ß¬ß 346, 347).Title 10, Delaware Code, Courts and Judicial Procedures West Virginia's Business Court Division Rule 24.09 expressly includes technology issues. The Davidson County, Tennessee Business Court Docket expressly encompasses technology and biotechnology licensing. North Carolina's Business Court jurisdiction expressly includes computer software, information technology and systems, data and data system security, biotechnology and bioscience technology. The High Court of Justice in England includes a Technology and Construction Court. California, Connecticut, Phoenix, Arizona,Mitchell L. Bach & Lee Applebaum, A History of the Creation and Jurisdiction of Business Courts in the Last Decade , 60 Business Lawyer 147 (2004). Oregon, and Minnesota have created specialized courts or tracks for complex litigation that would include some business disputes within a broader jurisdiction of complex matters. Arizona also has a specialized commercial court in Phoenix. Other states are in various stages of moving toward or away from business or complex courts, with Colorado having conducted extensive studies nearly two decades ago into the merits and potential parameters of creating a business court on a broad basis, which was not pursued, and Orlando, Florida having to move resources away from its Complex Business Litigation program into its family court, though this program was restored in October 2019, while New Jersey expanded to a statewide business court track in 2015, after having only two counties with specialized commercial courts for 20 years, and South Carolina's Business Court went from a regional pilot program and is now a permanent statewide program.

The band's sound is a mixture of Celtic traditional music fused with punk rock and funk. The band's lyrics embrace their culture, heritage and surroundings. They cover all manner of subjects from anti-fascist politics, immigration and unemployment to uprising and rebellion in Scotland, Ireland and beyond. Musical influences include The Pogues, Dick Gaughan, The Clash, Dropkick Murphys and Bob Dylan.  History  Christopher James Sheridan Performing as Murphy's Law for most of 2006, The Wakes officially formed in early 2007, releasing their debut album These Hands that summer and pioneering the first of three Glasgow-based Big Hooley concerts in September. Despite notable personnel changes (which saw Chris Cruickshank swap flute and mandolin duties for the bass guitar and Eamonn Maguire being drafted in on drums) in early February 2008, work began on the next album; released 18 months later as No Irish Need Apply on the band's own Big Hooley label. This album not only produced charity single The Uncrowned King of Football in memory of Glasgow Celtic legend Jimmy Johnstone, but also Pirates of the League, an ode to German football club F.C St. Pauli ‚Äì originally debuted by the band in Hamburg's Knust venue. Danny McGuinness live The Wakes 2017 live at \\"Das Bett\\" in Frankfurt European tours continued throughout the coming months, and in May 2010 The Wakes found themselves back in Hamburg once again, this time as part of the centenary celebrations for St Pauli, culminating in a performance at a sold-out, day long music festival in the Millerntor Stadion, sharing the bill with reuniting punk-rock luminaries Slime and indie rockers Thees Uhlmann and Kettcar. While the continued presence of electric instrumentation in The Wakes' material has provided the necessary edge to the group's rockier \\"folk 'n' roll\\" identity, they have long strived to maintain a tangible link to their traditional roots. In December 2011, they issued the entirely acoustic Stripped Back Sessions and in between their amplified sets, they still continue to perform acoustically, with appearances at Glasgow's Americana festival No Mean City (September 2012) and Celtic Connections (January 2013), and performances at Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall (December 2015) and at the city's Old Fruit Market and Oran Mor venues (early 2016). In August 2013, the group released The Red and the Green, which like its No Irish‚Ä¶ predecessor received favourable criticism in various music press, as the folk 'n' roll sound further deepened. This album was re-released in late 2015 when The Wakes signed with Hamburg-based Drakkar Records, with work beginning on Venceremos, the group's fifth LP and their second issued through the Drakkar label. Venceremos was launched in September 2016, becoming the band's most critically acclaimed recording so far.

Bacon‚Äôs Dictionary of Boston. 1886. P. 123-124. It was one of the largest art schools in the city, having several hundred scholars. By the end of the 19th century, Boston had become an important art center. A number of highly respected artists were teaching in the city. The rich environment for art had been promoted at least in part by the Massachusetts Drawing Act of 1870. The act mandated drawing lessons in public schools. To fill the need for art teachers, Massachusetts Normal Art (MNA) was established in 1873. Two blocks behind the Museum of Fine Arts, in the New Studio Building near the Back Bay Station, was the Cowles Art School (1883). Cowles Art School offered instruction in figure drawing and painting from the flat cast and life, artistic anatomy, perspective and composition, painting still life, drawing and painting the head from life, drawing still life, oil and water colors, ad perspective.

Chronic radiation syndrome develops with a speed and severity proportional to the radiation dose received (i.e., it is a deterministic effect of exposure to ionizing radiation), unlike radiation-induced cancer. It is distinct from acute radiation syndrome, in that it occurs at dose rates low enough to permit natural repair mechanisms to compete with the radiation damage during the exposure period. Dose rates high enough to cause the acute form (> ~0.1 Gy/h) are fatal long before onset of the chronic form. The lower threshold for chronic radiation syndrome is between 0.7 and 1.5 Gy, at dose rates above 0.1 Gy/yr. This condition is primarily known from the Kyshtym disaster, where 66 cases were diagnosed. It has received little mention in Western literature; but see the ICRP‚Äôs 2012 Statement. Compare the published draft () and note dose thresholds. In 2013, Alexander V. Akleyev described the chronology of the clinical course of CRS while presenting at ConRad in Munich, Germany. In his presentation, he defined the latent period as being 1-5 years, and the formation coinciding with the period of maximum radiation dose. The recovery period was described as being 3-12 months after exposure ceased. He concluded that \\"CRS represents a systemic response of the body as a whole to the chronic total body exposure in man.\\" In 2014, Akleyev's book \\"Comprehensive analysis of chronic radiation syndrome, covering epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathoanatomy, diagnosis and treatment\\" was published by Springer. Symptoms of chronic radiation syndrome would include, at an early stage, impaired sense of touch and smell and disturbances of the vegetative functions. At a later stage, muscle and skin atrophy and eye cataract follow, with possible fibrous formations on the skin, in case of previous radiation burns. Solid cancer or leukemia due to genetic damage may appear at any time.

The term \\"Kibaran\\" has often been used for any orogenic rocks formed during this very extended period. Recently it has been proposed that the term should be used in a much narrower sense for an event around 1375 Ma and a region in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Broad sense A-type granites. Regions that contain relics of Kibaran age include the Kibara Mountains of the eastern DRC and Namaqua-Natal belt in southern Africa. Rocks of this age have been found in the Hoggar Mountains, in northwest and southwest Nigeria and in Cameroon to the north of the Congo Craton. The orogeny in northwest Nigeria was a major tectonic and thermal event that apparently was floored by an older continental basin. In southern Africa, orogenic segments associated with construction of Rodinia are found in a region over long and wide. They resulted from convergence of the Congo Craton to the north with the Kalahari, Bangweulu, Tanzania and West-Nilian cratons to the south. The segments include sedimentary basins deformed by contraction of the crust during the extended period of plate convergence between 1400 Ma and 1000 Ma. These are intruded by large batholiths dated to 1390‚Äì1350 Ma and 1100‚Äì1000 Ma, caused by subduction and continental collision. Other segments are Archaean to Paleoproterozoic provinces that were strongly reworked into thin-skinned fold and thrust belts during the collision of 1100‚Äì1000 Ma. Local names for the segments, from north to south, are the Karagwe-Ankolean, Burundian, Kibarides, Irumides, Choma-Kalomo, Ngamiland, Namaqua-Natal and Lurio belts. Narrower sense In one model the Kibaran belt is a continuous orogenic belt long running in a northeast direction from Katanga Province in the DRC to southwest Uganda. However, there are two distinct segments: a southern belt that includes the Kibara Mountains in Katanga, from which the orogeny gets its name, and a northeastern belt that includes the Kivu-Maniema region of the DRC and parts of Rwanda, Burundi, southwest Uganda and northwest Tanzania. The two are separated by Palaeoproterozoic Rusizian terranes and the NW-SE trending Ubende shear belt further to the south in Tanzania. Zircon Uranium-lead dating shows that the long northeastern Karagwe-Ankolean segment dates to 1375 Ma. Apparently it is not orogenic but is an intracratonic large igneous province formed in the boundary between the Tanzania craton to the east and the Eburnean-aged mobile belt to the west. Minor magmatic events occurred later in this segment around 1205 Ma and 986 Ma. Recently it has been proposed that the term \\"Kibaran\\" should be given a much more restricted meaning, referring only to a tectono- magmatic event around 1375 Ma in which the Karagwe-Ankolean belt was formed in a region extending from the north of Lake Tanganyika to the south of Uganda, and that the term \\"Kibaran belt\\" should be confined to the belt around the Kibara mountains in the southeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

He was Margrave of Lusatia from 1291 to 1303. He was also Margrave of Osterland from 1291 until his death, and Landgrave of Thuringia, as Dietrich I, from 1298 until his death.  Life  Theodoric was born in 1260, the third son of Margrave Albert II of Meissen and his wife Margaret of Sicily. After Theodoric's mother fled from the Wartburg in 1270, because her husband had fallen in love with Kunigunde of Eisenberg, Theodoric and his elder brother Frederick were raised by their uncle Margrave Theodoric of Landsberg. After Theodoric and Frederick had come of age, they and their elder brother Henry fought a war against their father, who wanted his son Apitz, from his second marriage with Kunigunde, to inherit the Landgraviate of Thuringia. Theodoric's first territorial possession was the Pleissnerland. After the death of Margrave Henry III in 1288, he inherited Lusatia and after the death of Frederick Tuta in 1291 he inherited the Osterland. In 1301 Archbishop Burchard II of Magdeburg sold Theodoric the castles in Droy√üig and Burgwerben for 2000 marks of Stendal silver, with the option to buy them back later. Burchard did not use this option; instead he also sold the castle and town of Spremberg to Theodoric. In 1303, Theodoric sold Lusatia to the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which was ruled by the House of Ascania at the time. Adolph of Nassau, the King of the Romans, deprived Theodoric of his inherited lands, but after Adolph's fall Theodoric was reinstated. In 1307, King Albert I of Germany invaded the Osterland with a large army. Theodoric and his brother Frederick armed civilians and peasants and with some assistance from knights from Brunswick they defeated Albert in the Battle of Lucka on 31 May 1307. Theodoric died in December 1307 in Leipzig. According to later traditions, he was murdered on 24 or 25 December by one Philip of Nassau in the St. Thomas church in Leipzig. However, it is more likely that he died of natural causes on 10 December.  Marriage  Theodoric married in 1295 Jutta, a daughter of Count Berthold VIII of Henneberg. This marriage did not produce an heir. Jutta later married Otto IV, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal.  Ancestors  References  Bernd Kaufmann: Der Verleumdete.

Zhong Hui had support from Jiang Wei, a general from the former state of Shu Han, which was conquered by Wei forces just before the rebellion started. Zhong Hui, as one of the Wei commanders in the Conquest of Shu by Wei, had considered himself capable enough to overcome the Wei regime and establish his own kingdom in the newly conquered Shu territory.Alan Kam-Leung Chan, National University of Singapore. http://www.iep.utm.edu/zhonghui/#H1 The rebellion ended when some Wei officers and soldiers, who were unwilling to join Zhong Hui, started a mutiny against him and killed him and Jiang Wei. Background Initially, when Sima Zhao wanted to put Zhong Hui in charge of leading the Wei army to conquer Shu, Shao Ti warned him that Zhong Hui might rebel against Wei because he was in command of an army of thousands, was single, and had no family to worry about. Sima Zhao laughed and said he understood Shao Ti's concern very well, but chose to let Zhong Hui lead the Wei army because he had faith in Zhong's ability to conquer Shu. He also predicted that Zhong Hui would not succeed even if he rebelled because of two reasons. First, the people of Shu would be fearful after seeing how their state had been conquered, and hence would not help Zhong Hui. Second, the Wei forces would be exhausted after the campaign and want to return home, so they would not support Zhong.(ÂàùÔºåÊñáÁéãÊ¨≤ÈÅ£ÊúÉ‰ºêËúÄÔºåË•øÊõπÂ±¨ÈÇµÊÇåÊ±ÇË¶ãÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰ªäÈÅ£ÈçæÊúÉÁéáÂçÅÈ§òËê¨Ë°Ü‰ºêËúÄÔºåÊÑöË¨ÇÊúÉÂñÆË∫´ÁÑ°Èáç‰ªªÔºå‰∏çËã•‰ΩøÈ§ò‰∫∫Ë°å„ÄÇ„ÄçÊñáÁéãÁ¨ëÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊàëÂØßÁï∂Âæ©‰∏çÁü•Ê≠§ËÄ∂ÔºüËúÄÁÇ∫Â§©‰∏ã‰ΩúÊÇ£Ôºå‰ΩøÊ∞ë‰∏çÂæóÂÆâÊÅØÔºåÊàë‰ªä‰ºê‰πãÂ¶ÇÊåáÊéåËÄ≥ÔºåËÄåË°Ü‰∫∫ÁöÜË®ÄËúÄ‰∏çÂèØ‰ºê„ÄÇÂ§´‰∫∫ÂøÉË±´ÊÄØÂâáÊô∫Âãá‰∏¶Á´≠ÔºåÊô∫Âãá‰∏¶Á´≠ËÄåÂΩä‰Ωø‰πãÔºåÈÅ©ÁÇ∫ÊïµÁ¶ΩËÄ≥„ÄÇÊÉüÈçæÊúÉËàá‰∫∫ÊÑèÂêåÔºå‰ªäÈÅ£ÊúÉ‰ºêËúÄÔºåÂøÖÂèØÊªÖËúÄ„ÄÇÊªÖËúÄ‰πãÂæåÔºåÂ∞±Â¶ÇÂçøÊâÄÊÖÆÔºåÁï∂‰ΩïÊâÄËÉΩ‰∏ÄËæ¶ËÄ∂ÔºüÂá°ÊïóËªç‰πãÂ∞á‰∏çÂèØ‰ª•Ë™ûÂãáÔºå‰∫°Âúã‰πãÂ§ßÂ§´‰∏çÂèØËàáÂúñÂ≠òÔºåÂøÉËÜΩ‰ª•Á†¥ÊïÖ‰πü„ÄÇËã•ËúÄ‰ª•Á†¥ÔºåÈÅ∫Ê∞ëÈúáÊÅêÔºå‰∏çË∂≥ËàáÂúñ‰∫ãÔºõ‰∏≠ÂúãÂ∞áÂ£´ÂêÑËá™ÊÄùÊ≠∏Ôºå‰∏çËÇØËàáÂêå‰πü„ÄÇËã•‰ΩúÊÉ°ÔºåÁ•óËá™ÊªÖÊóèËÄ≥„ÄÇÂçø‰∏çÈ†àÊÜÇÊ≠§ÔºåÊÖéËé´‰Ωø‰∫∫ËÅû‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Both Deng Ai and Zhong Hui had taken part in the Conquest of Shu in 263, having acted as foils to each other during the invasion ‚Äì where Zhong Hui had demanded an advance through Jiange, Deng Ai had instead chosen to move through Yinping. Jiang Wei, having been surprised from Zhong Hui's eastern offensive, moved all troops from Yinping to halt Zhong Hui's advance. As a result, Deng Ai's advance through Yinping was swift enough to allow him to quickly reach Chengdu and demand Liu Shan's surrender. In the following occupation of the Shu territory, Deng Ai began issuing orders in Chengdu an autocratic fashion, while Zhong Hui began exhibiting signs of hubris, believing himself to no longer be capable of serving under another. Jiang Wei, by contrast, liaised with Liu Shan, outlining a plan to trick Zhong Hui into rebellion, weakening Wei troops, before killing Zhong and seizing power of the troops while re-declaring Shu's independence. Preparation Zhong Hui's first course of action was to falsify letters proving a purported plan by Deng Ai to rebel, creating distrust between Sima Zhao and Deng Ai; this was supplemented by Deng Ai's own growing arrogance in his correspondence with Sima. Zhong Hui, skilled in forgery, secretly intercepted and edited a report from Deng Ai to the Wei imperial court to exaggerate Deng Ai's arrogance, while simultaneously submitting a report of his own to express suspicion of Deng Ai; he also destroyed a letter from Sima Zhao to Deng Ai in a further effort to alienate the latter.(‰∏ñË™ûÊõ∞ÔºöÊúÉÂñÑÊïà‰∫∫Êõ∏ÔºåÊñºÂäíÈñ£Ë¶ÅËâæÁ´†Ë°®ÁôΩ‰∫ãÔºåÁöÜÊòìÂÖ∂Ë®ÄÔºå‰ª§Ëæ≠ÊåáÊÇñÂÇ≤ÔºåÂ§öËá™Áüú‰ºê„ÄÇÂèàÊØÄÊñáÁéãÂ†±Êõ∏ÔºåÊâã‰Ωú‰ª•Áñë‰πã‰πü„ÄÇ) Shiyu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 28. In early 264, Sima Zhao issued an edict eneoffing Zhong Hui as Minister of the Interior and ordering Zhong Hui to capture Deng Ai to be brought to the Wei capital, Luoyang, to account for his conduct. Wei Guan was ordered to arrest Deng Ai and his son Deng Zhong on Zhong Hui's command. Zhong Hui hoped that Wei Guan would be killed doing this, which would strongly back up the false accusations against Deng Ai; however, Wei Guan surprised Deng Ai in the night after Deng Ai's troops laid down their arms in deference to Sima Zhao's edict; Deng Ai was successfully captured, after which he was imprisoned in a cart.(ÊúÉÂÖßÊúâÁï∞ÂøóÔºåÂõ†ÈÑßËâæÊâøÂà∂Â∞à‰∫ãÔºåÂØÜÁôΩËâæÊúâÂèçÁãÄÔºåÊñºÊòØË©îÊõ∏Ê™ªËªäÂæµËâæ„ÄÇÂè∏È¶¨ÊñáÁéãÊáºËâæÊàñ‰∏çÂæûÂëΩÔºåÂãëÊúÉ‰∏¶ÈÄ≤ËªçÊàêÈÉΩÔºåÁõ£ËªçË°ûÁìòÂú®ÊúÉÂâçË°åÔºå‰ª•ÊñáÁéãÊâãÁ≠Ü‰ª§ÂÆ£ÂñªËâæËªçÔºåËâæËªçÁöÜÈáã‰ªóÔºåÈÅÇÊî∂ËâæÂÖ•Ê™ªËªä„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. However, at the same time, Sima Zhao personally led an army out of the Luoyang with Jia Chong towards Chengdu. As Sima Zhao moved to lead his forces to station at Chang'an, Shao Ti told Sima that there was no need for him to go to Chang'an because Zhong Hui was capable of arresting Deng Ai on his own since he had five to six times more troops than Deng. Sima Zhao replied, \\"Have you forgotten what you said previously? Why are you asking me not to go now? Please keep secret what we spoke about. I treat people with trust and respect. As long as they remain loyal to me, I will not doubt them. Jia Chong recently asked me, 'Are you suspicious of Zhong Hui?' I replied, 'If I send you on a mission today, do you think I doubt you?'

Zhong Hui immediately became acting commander of Wei forces in the former Shu territory, at which point his hubris reached its height. Zhong Hui outlined a plan to capture Luoyang: # Jiang Wei would lead a vanguard force out of the Xie Valley (ÊñúË∞∑) to attack the city of Chang'an. Zhong Hui would follow behind with the main army and provide support. # After capturing Chang'an, the army would be split into two groups ‚Äì infantry and cavalry. The infantry would sail along the Wei and Yellow rivers towards Meng Ford (Â≠üÊ¥•) near Luoyang while the cavalry would ride towards Luoyang on land. Zhong Hui estimated that the journey would take five days. # The infantry and cavalry would rendezvous outside Luoyang and attack the city together.(ÊúÉÊâÄÊÜöÊÉüËâæÔºåËâæÊó£Á¶ΩËÄåÊúÉÂ∞ãËá≥ÔºåÁç®Áµ±Â§ßË°ÜÔºåÂ®ÅÈúáË•øÂúü„ÄÇËá™Ë¨ÇÂäüÂêçËìã‰∏ñÔºå‰∏çÂèØÂæ©ÁÇ∫‰∫∫‰∏ãÔºåÂä†ÁåõÂ∞áÈä≥ÂçíÁöÜÂú®Â∑±ÊâãÔºåÈÅÇË¨ÄÂèç„ÄÇÊ¨≤‰ΩøÂßúÁ∂≠Á≠âÁöÜÂ∞áËúÄÂÖµÂá∫ÊñúË∞∑ÔºåÊúÉËá™Â∞áÂ§ßË°ÜÈö®ÂÖ∂Âæå„ÄÇÊó£Ëá≥Èï∑ÂÆâÔºå‰ª§È®éÂ£´ÂæûÈô∏ÈÅìÔºåÊ≠•ÂÖµÂæûÊ∞¥ÈÅìÈ†ÜÊµÅÊµÆÊ∏≠ÂÖ•Ê≤≥Ôºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫‰∫îÊó•ÂèØÂà∞Â≠üÊ¥•ÔºåËàáÈ®éÊúÉÊ¥õÈôΩÔºå‰∏ÄÊó¶Â§©‰∏ãÂèØÂÆö‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28.

We will be meeting each other soon.\\" After reading the letter, Zhong Hui was shocked and he told his close aides, \\"When His Excellency ordered me to arrest Deng Ai, he knew I was capable of accomplishing the task alone. However, now, since he has brought his troops here, he must be suspecting me. We should take action quickly. If we succeed, the Empire is ours.

Having heard this news, Zhong Hui then openly declared his rebellion with the likes of Jiang Wei as Zhong Hui's chief general. Zhong Hui arrived in Chengdu on 29 February 264. The following day, he summoned all the high-ranking officers and former Shu officers to the old Shu imperial court in the name of holding a memorial service for the recently deceased Empress Dowager Guo. During the service, he showed them a forgery he had made of an imperial decree claiming to have been issued by the empress dowager before her death. In the decree, Empress Dowager Guo wanted all those who were loyal to Wei to rise up against Sima Zhao and remove him from power. Zhong Hui sought the officers' opinions, asked them to sign on a list if they agreed to carry out the empress dowager's dying wish, and then instructed his close aides to take over command of the various military units. He then had all the officers detained in their respective offices with the doors shut, and ordered the gates of the city to be closed and tightly guarded.(ÊúÉ‰ª•‰∫îÂπ¥Ê≠£ÊúàÂçÅ‰∫îÊó•Ëá≥ÔºåÂÖ∂ÊòéÊó•ÔºåÊÇâË´ãË≠∑Ëªç„ÄÅÈÉ°ÂÆà„ÄÅÁâôÈñÄÈ®éÁù£‰ª•‰∏äÂèäËúÄ‰πãÊïÖÂÆòÔºåÁÇ∫Â§™ÂêéÁôºÂñ™ÊñºËúÄÊúùÂ†Ç„ÄÇÁüØÂ§™ÂêéÈÅ∫Ë©îÔºå‰ΩøÊúÉËµ∑ÂÖµÂª¢ÊñáÁéãÔºåÁöÜÁè≠Á§∫Âùê‰∏ä‰∫∫Ôºå‰Ωø‰∏ãË≠∞Ë®ñÔºåÊõ∏ÁâàÁΩ≤ÁΩÆÔºåÊõ¥‰ΩøÊâÄË¶™‰ø°‰ª£È†òË´∏Ëªç„ÄÇÊâÄË´ãÁæ§ÂÆòÔºåÊÇâÈñâËëóÁõäÂ∑ûË´∏ÊõπÂ±ã‰∏≠ÔºåÂüéÈñÄÂÆÆÈñÄÁöÜÈñâÔºåÂö¥ÂÖµÂúçÂÆà„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. One of Zhong Hui's officers was Qiu Jian (‰∏òÂª∫), a former subordinate of the officer Hu Lie, who had recommended Qiu Jian to Sima Zhao. Zhong Hui favoured and regarded Qiu Jian highly and requested for him to be transferred to his unit. Qiu Jian sympathised with Hu Lie, who was detained alone inside a room, so he approached Zhong Hui and said that each of the detained officers should have a servant to attend to their personal needs, to which Zhong Hui agreed. Hu Lie lied to his servant and wrote a letter to his sons, in which he claimed he heard from Qiu Jian that Zhong Hui was planning to purge the officers not from his own unit by luring them into a trap and killing them. The rumour spread like wildfire among all the detained officers. When Zhong Hui's men received news about the rumour, they suggested to their superior to execute all the officers holding the rank of \\"Cavalry Commandant of the Standard\\" (ÁâôÈñÄÈ®éÁù£) and above and absorb the troops from Deng Ai's officers into the rebel forces. Jiang Wei particularly supported this, a personal ploy to weaken the Wei forces preceding a resurrection of the Shu state, and Zhong Hui, though doubtful, agreed to the plan.(ÊúÉÂ∏≥‰∏ãÁù£‰∏òÂª∫Êú¨Â±¨ËÉ°ÁÉàÔºåÁÉàËñ¶‰πãÊñáÁéãÔºåÊúÉË´ã‰ª•Ëá™Èö®Ôºå‰ªªÊÑõ‰πã„ÄÇÂª∫ÊÑçÁÉàÁç®ÂùêÔºåÂïüÊúÉÔºå‰ΩøËÅΩÂÖß‰∏ÄË¶™ÂÖµÂá∫ÂèñÈ£≤È£üÔºåË´∏ÁâôÈñÄÈö®‰æãÂêÑÂÖß‰∏Ä‰∫∫„ÄÇÁÉàÁ¥øË™ûË¶™ÂÖµÂèäÁñèËàáÂÖ∂Â≠êÊõ∞Ôºö„Äå‰∏òÂª∫ÂØÜË™™Ê∂àÊÅØÔºåÊúÉÂ∑≤‰ΩúÂ§ßÂùëÔºåÁôΩÊ£ìÊï∏ÂçÉÔºåÊ¨≤ÊÇâÂëºÂ§ñÂÖµÂÖ•Ôºå‰∫∫Ë≥úÁôΩ„°äÔºåÊãúÁÇ∫Êï£Â∞áÔºå‰ª•Ê¨°Ê£ìÊÆ∫Âùë‰∏≠„ÄÇ„ÄçË´∏ÁâôÈñÄË¶™ÂÖµ‰∫¶Âí∏Ë™™Ê≠§Ë™ûÔºå‰∏ÄÂ§úÂÇ≥Áõ∏ÂëäÔºåÁöÜÂæß„ÄÇÊàñË¨ÇÊúÉÔºö„ÄåÂèØÁõ°ÊÆ∫ÁâôÈñÄÈ®éÁù£‰ª•‰∏ä„ÄÇ„ÄçÊúÉÁå∂Ë±´Êú™Ê±∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. Downfall Around noon on 3 March 264, Hu Lie's son Hu Yuan, his siblings, and his father's subordinates started beating the drums and their soldiers followed suit. After that, they rushed towards the city gates in a disorderly manner because they had no one to lead them. Wei Guan and Qiu Jian joined the uprising against Zhong Hui. Around the time, Jiang Wei was collecting his armour and weapons from Zhong Hui when they heard shouting and received news that a fire had broken out. Moments later, it was reported that many soldiers were crowding near the city gates. Zhong Hui was surprised and he asked Jiang Wei, \\"Those men are causing trouble. What should we do?\\" Jiang Wei replied, \\"Kill them.\\" Zhong Hui then ordered his men to kill the officers who were still detained in their offices. Some of the officers used pieces of furniture to block the doors. Zhong Hui's men rammed the doors but could not force them open. A while later, there were reports of people climbing up the city gates on ladders and of people setting fire to buildings. Chaos broke out and arrows were fired in all directions. The detained officers broke out of captivity, regrouped with their men, and attacked Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei fought the mutinying soldiers and slew about five or six of them, but were eventually overwhelmed and killed by them. Zhong Hui was 40 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died.

Following these events, Wei Guan returned to service under Sima Zhao, eventually serving under his son Sima Yan and the Jin dynasty, which he founded soon after. In popular culture The rebellion is featured in Chapter 119 of the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. A popular anecdote included in the novel concerning the rebellion is that when Jiang Wei was killed, his body was mutilated to expose the gall bladder (the traditional source of courage in Chinese culture,) which had swollen to a huge size, implying reckless foolishness ‚Äî it is described with a phrase now used as a proverb: \\"ËÜΩÂ§ßÂ¶ÇÊñó gallbladder as big as a dou\\".A dou (Êñó) is a traditional unit of volume measurement, approximately 10 cubic decimetres. His gallbladder was said to have been buried separately from his body, and a tomb stands in its purported burial place.China History Forum thread, \\"Three Kingdoms tombs\\". http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/index.php?/topic/3330-three- kingdoms-tombs/ References * Chen, Shou.

Biography Washington was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan. He graduated from Roeper High School. Following graduation, he briefly attended New York University, although he never graduated. In the early 1990s, along with Dwayne McDuffie and John Paul Leon, he co-created Static, an African American teenage superhero, part of the Milestone imprint published by DC Comics. His 18-issue initial run writing the series received critical praise for its characterization of the protagonist. Subsequently, he contributed to several additional comic books (mostly published by DC), including co-creating Shadow Cabinet and writing for Extreme Justice, The Batman Chronicles, JLA Secret Files, and (for Acclaim Comics) Ninjak. Following a contraction of the comic-book-publishing industry in the mid-1990s, Washington had difficulties finding work as a writer.

Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to \\"honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position\\". This category was one of the three newly created categories for the 55th Annual Grammy Awards as Best Urban Contemporary Album. In June 2020, the National Academy for Recording Arts & Sciences announced a renaming and redefining of the category. Its new name was Best Progressive R&B; Album, with immediate effect, \\"to appropriately categorize and describe this subgenre. This change includes a more accurate definition to describe the merit or characteristics of music compositions or performances themselves within the genre of R&B;\\". Adding to this, the description of this category is now as follows: \\"[t]his category is intended to highlight albums that include the more progressive elements of R&B; and may include samples and elements of hip-hop, rap, dance, and electronic music. It may also incorporate production elements found in pop, euro-pop, country, rock, folk, and alternative.\\" According to Recording Academy president Harvey Mason Jr. in the same press release, these changes reflected \\"the current state of the music industry and how it's evolved over the past 12 months.\\" In the weeks leading up to this decision, the label \\"urban\\" to indicate music made by African American musicians, songwriters and producers had come under fire. The award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer, provided they are credited with more than 50% of playing time on the album. A producer and engineer with less than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, can apply for a \\"Winners Certificate\\".  Controversies  Many African American musicians have disputed the use of the term \\"urban contemporary\\", seen as a \\"catchall for music created by Black artists, regardless of genre\\". In a backstage interview given after his first Grammy win, artist Tyler, the Creator stated that \\"[i]t sucks that whenever we ‚Äî and I mean guys that look like me ‚Äî do anything that's genre-bending or that's anything, they always put it in a rap or urban category\\", adding that \\"I don't like that 'urban' word ‚Äî it's just a politically correct way to say the n-word to me\\".

Its aim was to develop a flexible, modular, heavy-lift, high rate space launch vehicle that could deliver payloads to Earth orbit at a tenth the cost of existing boosters. Background An artist's rendering of a space launch system The ALS was a joint USAF and NASA study from 1987 to 1990. It was an endeavour of the years following the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. Colonel John R. Wormington (retired Brigadier General USAF) was the Program Director of the Joint Department of Defense and NASA Advanced Launch System Program Office. Lieutenant Colonel Michael C. Mushala (retired Major General USAF) was assigned as Wormington's deputy. The program operated from the Los Angeles Air Force Base. In October 1989, Mushala was promoted to Colonel. In February 1990, Wormington was reassigned to command the 45th Space Wing at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. Mushala became the program director and remained so until the project was disbanded in July 1990. Although the project had a projected research and development cost of $15 billion, its early cancellation led to a final cost just under $3 billion. The ALS program office differed from others in that it was the only one within the Air Force Space Command. The office was furnished with Apple Mac OS personal computers instead of the Command's usual Microsoft Windows systems. This was in part because NASA had already been using Apple computers. The program office pioneered what later became the Microsoft Project.  Aims  The ALS program was charged with deploying the space based elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program. Secondly, the ALS program was to find a way to transport many thousands of tons of equipment for the SDI into low Earth orbit at a cost less than $1,000 per kilogram. The usual cost was about $10,000 per kg.\\"ALS Contractors Concentrate on Expendable, Reusable Designs\\", Aerospace Daily, 20 June 1989 page 463 The program had three main contractors, each with an $800 million multi-year contract. They were Boeing Aerospace, Martin- Marietta, and General Dynamics. The ALS program budget was just under $2.5 billion.  Progress  In 1989, the Bush Administration, via the Defense Acquisition Board, was asked to ratify an existing plan to have the ALS program at an advanced state of development in 1990; ready for a first flight in 1998; and fully operational in 2000.Wolfe, M.G. et al, \\"The Advanced Launch System.\\" 40th International Astronautical Federation Congress, Malaga Spain, 8‚Äì14 October 1989, IAF Paper 89-229. Then, from 2000 to 2005, the ALS program would develop a modular family of launch vehicles, with a payload capacity to low Earth orbit ranging from 5,000 kilograms to 200,000 kilograms.Branscome, D.R., \\"The United States Space Transportation Survey,\\" Proceedings of the 2nd European Aerospace Conference on Progress in Space Transportation, (European Space Agency, ESA SP-293, August 1989), pages 39-44. However, by late 1989, it was apparent that the ALS program was no longer required.\\"Air Force Embraces Expendable Launchers,\\" Military Space, 17 July 1989, page 3-4. The initial phase of the SDI would employ existing Titan IV and Atlas II rockets. The launch requirements for subsequent phases of the SDI deployment were too vague to allow the immediate ongoing direction of the ALS program and its associated costs.\\"Adams, Peter, \\"Congress May Consider ALS Too Costly, Sources Say,\\" Defense News, 27 March 1989, page 25.Finnegan, Philip, \\"Report: ALS Program Lacks Mission, Should be Pared to Propulsion Study,\\" Defense News, 25 September 1989, page 4.

Situated in The Ozarks along the Black River, the park features the artificial Lake Charles. The lake is a result of a partnership of four agencies to construct a multipurpose lake just north of Shirey Bay Rainey Brake Wildlife Management Area in an effort to control flooding and preserve the watershed. Construction on the lake began in 1964, and the park was dedicated in 1967. History The original idea for a lake came in 1954 when the Lawrence County Soil and Water Conservation District Board of Supervisors applied to the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program in the interest of protecting the watershed and preventing flooding downstream. However, the Small Watershed Act was passed before any action could be taken. This allowed for construction that benefited fish and wildlife development. The plans for Lake Charles were changed to that the Shirey Bay Rainey Brake Wildlife Management Area immediately to the south could be supplied with fresh water during hot summer months. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC) owns and operates all Wildlife Management Areas in Arkansas and became supporters of Lake Charles' construction. Locals showed their support be forming the Flat Creek Watershed Improvement District and obtaining a loan from the Farmers Home Administration. The Publicity and Parks Commission pledged to maintain the lake as Lake Charles State Park and construction began in 1964. Official dedication of Lake Charles State Park took place on May 28, 1967. Recreation Lake Charles State Park offers many different opportunities for outdoors enthusiasts including fishing, camping, swimming, and hiking. The lake is maintained by the AGFC, who stock catfish, crappie, largemouth bass, white bass, and others. Camping is available at any of Lake Charles' 61 campsites (23 class AAA, 37 class B, one RV). Lake Charles State Park offers four trails for walking and hiking, ranging from easy to moderate difficulty. Spread throughout the park are picnic areas, a playground, a screened-in pavilion with fans, fishing and boat docks, an interpretive nature center and gift shop.

The line was opened in 1879, and connected to the Tay Bridge, giving quick access to Dundee; daily residential travel to Dundee from Tayport became a practicality. The use of the bridge gave the railway a massive advantage in passenger and goods transport across the Tay, until the opening of the Tay Road Bridge in 1966. Closure of the railway swiftly followed, and there is no railway use of the route at the present day. First railways The Newport Railway in 1879The first railway serving the north-eastern part of Fife was the Edinburgh and Northern Railway, authorised in 1845. Its main lines were built from Burntisland to Perth and to Ferry-Port-on-Craig, and opened in 1849. Ferry-Port-on-Craig was the harbour for the ferry crossing the River Tay to Broughty, and passengers and goods to and from Dundee used the Dundee and Arbroath Railway from Broughty. In 1851 Ferry-Port-on-Craig station was renamed Tay-Port (later Tayport) and the E&NR; altered its name to the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway. The ferry between Tay-Port and Broughty for goods and mineral traffic was adapted to take railway wagons on the vessel; this was a very early instance of roll-on roll- off ferry operation. (Passengers travelled on conventional ferries on the route.) Tay-Port was little more than a ferry terminal, having been overtaken by the town of Newport-on-Tay, a few miles to the west, which, before the railway, had a more convenient ferry to Dundee. Indeed, the early deliberations of the Edinburgh and Northern Railway included the possibility of taking the route of the railway through Newport, either for a bridge or as a ferry terminal. Newport had a population of 1,326 at the 1861 census.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15, North of Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1989, In 1856 local interests promoted a Tayport and Craighead Railway; it was to run from the Edinburgh, Perth and Dundee Railway station at Tayport, and run to a pier on the River Tay at Craighead, at the north-eastern extremity of Newport.Dundee, Perth, and Cupar Advertiser, 14 November 1856William Scott Bruce, The Railways of Fife, Methven Press, Perth, 1980 This scheme, in effect duplicating the EP&DR; route to Dundee, came to nothing. In 1862 the EP&DR; was absorbed by the growing North British Railway. Local people in Newport saw the benefits that being situated on a railway line offered, and from 1860 there had been gathering momentum behind the construction by the EP&DR; and the North British Railway of a Tay Bridge. This would transform the fortunes of North Fife, and more particularly it offered an opportunity to the railway promoters of Newport. A line from Tay-Port to the Fife end of the Tay Bridge would connect into the southward railway network at Tay-Port and towards Dundee at the bridge. A six-mile railway linking the two was what they wanted. The Newport Railway Accordingly, the Newport Railway obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 6 August 1866, with share capital of ¬£96,000. However the Act only authorised the share capital, and at a subscription meeting on 5 November 1866 to permit the public to subscribe, no-one turned up: there was not enough ready money locally to pay for a railway. There was much worse to come; the North British Railway was in serious financial difficulty, and was being called upon to repay substantial secured loans; at the same time shareholder agitation that the NBR had been over-reaching itself financially took hold. The Directors of the NBR had to bow to the pressure, and the Parliamentary Bill for the planned Tay Bridge was withdrawn. With it, for the time being, went the plans of the Newport Railway. They did not want to lose their railway altogether, so they cut it back to the 1856 scheme: \\"The promoters of the Newport Railway have, in consequence of the abandonment of the Tay Bridge, found it necessary to abandon part of their scheme, and a Bill is to be brought forward authorising them to make the terminus of the line at Craighead, which would be convenient for East, but scarcely so for West, Newport.\\"Dundee Advertiser; 17 November 1866 Craighead is some distance north- east of Newport, at a place where the crossing to Dundee is narrowest, and there may have been thoughts of establishing a ferry pier there cheaply. \\"The Newport Railway: This line, which is only scheduled to come up to Craighead Cottage, has a length of two miles all but seven yards. The present plans show a deviation from those of last year; the line being now taken at a lower level, nearer the water's edge. It is only to be regretted that it is to terminate for the present so far to the east of Newport.\\"Dundee Advertiser: 1 December 1866 The much-reduced railway got its revised authorisation; putting a brave face on the situation, the Directors reported that: > The abandonment of the Tay Bridge scheme rendered it necessary to delay > taking any steps under the powers conferred on the Company by the Act. To > afford to the rising and populous village of Newport more easy access to > Dundee on the one hand, and connection with the railway system to the south > on the other, as well as to give greater facilities of access between Dundee > and Ferry-Port-on-Craig, were the objects sought to be obtained by the > original Act; and, as there was no prospect of the original scheme being > carried out for a considerable time, it seemed desirable to your Directors, > if it were possible to do so, to accomplish these objects by a modified > plan... It was arranged, in view of [the North British Railway] Company > improving their station at Dundee, to construct a short line commencing at > the terminus at Tayport, and terminating at a point near Craighead Cottage, > to the east of Newport.

Back to the original route The North British Railway did not pick up the invitation to take over the little company. However it soon managed to put its financial problems behind it, and the scheme to build a Tay Bridge was back on. The Newport Railway was quick to spot the changed circumstances, and in 1870 it obtained a third Act of Parliament, reinstating the original route, to build throughout from Tayport to the Tay Bridge. It managed to assemble the capital it required to build its line. Opening The Tay Bridge opened on 1 June 1878 and the Newport Company progressed with building its line. It opened to traffic on 12 May 1879 between Newport and the relocated Tayport station,Tayport station had been built as a terminus station facing the jetty there; when the Newport company transformed it into a through station, it was relocated a short distance. and throughout on 13 May 1879:David Ross, The North British Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, John Thomas, The North British Railway, volume 1, David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1969, The Tay-Port ferry closed and residential travel from the Fife coast to Dundee became a practical possibility. The line was single track except for a crossing loop at Tayport and another at Wormit. A crossing loop was provided at East Newport in 1878. Tay-Port became Fife's largest station north of Cupar. In the down direction, the line from Tayport to East Newport climbed at 1 in 83 and 1 in 72 for 2.5 miles, and was then broadly level to beyond the station, then falling at 1 in 103 and 1 in 193 for about a mile past West Newport, levelling off to 1 in 313 for a quarter mile, then falling at 1 in 66 to Wormit tunnel; through the tunnel the line fell at 1 in 178.Ministry of Transport & Ciivil Aviation, Report on the Derailment which occurred on 28th May 1955 at Wormit in the Scottish Region of British Railways, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, 1956 The Tay Bridge disaster and afterwards However the new railway was not to be open for long; on 28 December 1879 part of the Tay Bridge fell, taking a train with it, in the Tay Bridge disaster, in which 75 persons perished. The Newport Railway had lost its connection to Dundee. Suddenly the Tay-Port end of the line became the route to Dundee once again, by way of the ferry to Broughty. The ferry had been closed down when the Tay Bridge was opened, and it had to be quickly reinstated. Beyond the loss of life, this was a massive set back for the North British Railway, and the company set about the business of building a replacement. The reconstructed Tay Bridge opened to passenger trains on 20 June 1887,Goods trains had been running since 13 June. and the Newport line was connected to a rearranged junction at Wormit. The passenger trains service consisted of four through trains from Leuchars to Dundee in addition to 13 weekday trains from Tayport to Dundee. A limited-stop passenger service achieved a ten-minute journey from Dundee to Newport West, fourteen minutes to Newport East. The Wormit to Tayport line was one of the few Scottish branch lines to offer Sunday services, in connection with attendance at divine service in Dundee by Fife residents. From 1900 Diesel multiple unit train at Tayport station The Newport Company was absorbed by the North British Railway on 6 August 1900. By April 1910 the passenger train service was 21 trains each way daily. A train derailed at Wormit on 28 May 1955. It was a school special excursion returning from Tayport to Dundee; an LMS class 5 steam engine running tender first derailed on the sharp curve emerging from the tunnel. Three persons were killed and 42 injured. Excessive speed on the curve was the immediate cause, and both the driver and the guard had been drinking. The road bridge, and closure The Newport-on-Tay branch, as it had become, enjoyed a high level of patronage, and the existence of the Tay (Rail) Bridge enabled daily commuter travel to Dundee. In the late 1950s it became obvious that this monopoly position had a limited life, as the Tay Road Bridge began to be constructed. The line from Leuchars to Tayport had closed in 1956, and Tayport was served from the Wormit end by the branch. On 22 May 1966 the section of the branch from Newport East to Tayport was closed, although Tayport station remained open to issue tickets on the replacement bus service, and to handle parcels.Thomas, in Forgotten Railways, says that \\"Tayport to Newport East was closed completely on 18 December 1967 on the encroachment of the Tay Bridge works.\\" He may be referring to the final closure of the non-rail connected Tayport office. The remainder of the branch was to be closed on 6 January 1969, but it was delayed when the Local Authority demanded the provision of a turning circle for buses at Wormit station; finally the entire branch closed on 5 May 1969.John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1976, Gordon Stansfield, Fife's Lost Railways, Stenlake Publishing, Catrine, 1998, Some buildings from Wormit Station have now been re-erected at the Scottish Railway Preservation SocietyThe Scottish Railway Preservation Society dismantled some of the station buildings at Wormit and re-erected them at Bo'ness on the south bank of the Forth estuary.

It was founded in 2011 by Marc Chaikin. The centerpiece of Chaikin Analytics is the Chaikin Power Gauge stock rating. In 2016 it was named one of \\"Two Top Websites for Quantitative Analysis\\" by Barron's (newspaper). The Chaikin Power Gauge Rating The Chaikin Power Gauge Rating is a stock rating that uses a basic color scale to indicate the investment potential of a stock: red shows that a stock is bearish, yellow that it has a neutral rating, and green that it is bullish. The 20 factors which make up the rating are organized into four categories: financial metrics, earnings performance, price-volume activity, and expert opinions. One of the factors in the rating is Chaikin Money Flow (CMF). The rating was back-tested on 10 years of data. In April 2014, Chaikin collaborated with Nasdaq to overlay the Chaikin Power Gauge stock rating on three popular Nasdaq stock indexes: Large Cap, Small Cap, and Dividend Achievers. In 2017, Chaikin Analytics launched a collaboration with Nasdaq and IndexIQ to bring the Chaikin Power Gauge stock rating approach to the ETF marketplace for the first time.  Chaikin Indicators =Chaikin Oscillator The Chaikin Oscillator was developed in the 1970s. The indicator is based upon the momentum of the Accumulation/Distribution (AD). AD calculates the position of a stock's daily closing price as a fraction of the daily price range of the stock‚Äîa fraction that is multiplied by the daily volume in order to quantify the net accumulation or distribution of a stock. AD is expressed mathematically as: AD = cum\\\\frac{(C - L) - (H - C)}{(H - L)}\\\\times V\\\\\\\\!\\\\, or AD = cum\\\\frac{2C - (H + L)}{(H - L)}\\\\times V\\\\\\\\!\\\\, where \\"AD\\" represents the Accumulation/Distribution cumulative total running line, \\"cum\\" is an instructive abbreviation meaning \\"calculate a cumulative total running line\\", \\"C\\" is the daily closing price, \\"H\\" is the daily high price, \\"L\\" is the daily low price, and \\"V\\" is the daily total volume. The indicator is measured as the difference between the 3-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the AD to the 10-day EMA of the AD. It signals when crossing above or below the zero line or when bullish/bearish departures take place. These signals anticipate the change in direction of the AD. Stock analysts observe a Chaikin Oscillator graph to look for the signal to buy or sell a stock. Chaikin Money Flow Chaikin Money Flow (also referred to as CMF) measures Money Flow Volume over a period, typically 20 or 21 days. The indicator oscillates above and below the zero line which indicates a bullish or bearish trend. The indicator is also used to calculate Chaikin‚Äôs Accumulation/Distribution (AD). It is based on the concept that buying support is normally demonstrated by increased volume and repeated closes in the top half of the daily range and that selling pressure is shown by increased volume and recurrent closes in the lower half of the daily range. Rising prices typically accompany buying support and decreasing prices usually occur with selling pressure. The end result is a picture of how money is flowing into or out of a stock. To determine the CMF one must first determine the Close Location Value (CLV) as follows: CLV = \\\\frac{(close_{1} - low_{1}) - (high_{1} - close_{1})}{(high_{1} - low_{1})}\\\\\\\\!\\\\, or CLV = \\\\frac{2close_{1} - (high_{1} + low_{1})}{(high_{1} - low_{1})}\\\\\\\\!\\\\, The next step is to take the CLV and determine the CMF, as follows: CMF = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{t=20}^tCLV_{t} \\\\times volume_{t}}{\\\\sum_{t=20}^t(vol_{t})}\\\\\\\\!\\\\, The formula, in Metastock format, for calculating the 21-period Chaikin Money Flow, is as follows: sum(((( C-L ) ‚Äì (H-C )) /(H-L )) * V,21) / sum(V,21) References Companies based in Philadelphia ","title":"Chaikin Analytics"},{"id":"36107860","title":"State Procession at the State Opening of Parliament"},{"id":"36107865","text":"Point du Jour International is a French documentary and magazine producer and publisher, with a headquarters in Paris, France.
