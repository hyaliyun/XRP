Its stated aim is to \\"work together to improve patient access to effective medical technologies\\". The Group launched in 2000.  Membership  Current members of the MTG are:  Research  Innovation adoption in the NHS  In its report Our NHS: A Spotlight on the Innovation Landscape, published in January 2020, the MTG assessed the mechanisms for innovation and technology within the NHS, and whether they foster an environment that delivers timely treatments to patients and takes full advantage of the health technology on offer.https://mtg.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2020/01/Our-NHS-A-Spotlight-on-the-Innovation-Landscape-FINAL- PDF.pdf The report evaluated the key innovation organisations, based on factors such as how they perform, interact and operate with one another and considered the changes that have taken place since the 2016 D√©j√† Review report, assessing whether the development of the Accelerated Access Review took the recommendations made in this report into account and avoided previous mistakes.  CCG treatment rationing  Over half of clinical commissioning groups restrict access to cataract surgery, research by the Medical Technology Group into CCGs' lists of 'Procedures of Limited Clinical Value' in October 2018 revealed.http://www.rationwatch.co.uk/ccgs/ Other findings were that almost half of CCGs limit access to hernia repair and many take a 'watchful waiting' approach, which can increase emergency cases and lead to worse patient outcomes. In addition, 78 CCGs restrict hip and knee replacement, despite the surgery being proven to be effective in keeping people mobile since over half a century. A further 12 CCGs refuse to provide patients with continuous glucose monitoring, while seven only provide it with an individual funding request. The Royal National Institute for Blind People (RNIB) described the findings as \\"shocking\\", while the Royal College of Surgeons said that \\"It is wrong for commissioning groups to label operations for hip and knee replacements, and hernia surgery, as of limited value ‚Äì thereby delaying or denying surgery to patients in pain.\\" In 2019 the Medical Technology Group launched a campaign 'Ration Watch' calling for a national body to scrutinise decisions by individual CCGs and ensure patient access to treatments is consistent across the country.http://www.rationwatch.co.uk  STPs and the use of technology  Nine out of ten regional NHS plans are failing to pay enough attention to the role of medical technology, a report by the Medical Technology Group report found in November 2018. All 44 regional STP plans were analysed in the report STPs and the use of technology, which concluded that the NHS is risking missing out on the opportunity to benefit from the use of innovative medical technology.https://mtg.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/11/STPs-and-the-use-of-technology-low-res.pdf Seven recommendations for ensuring healthcare systems assess, procure, commission and deliver technology-based treatments effectively are set out in the report. Writing on the BMA website, MTG Chair Barbara Harpham said: \\"Until it puts an end to its perverse incentives, the NHS will never truly embrace technology and realise its benefits.\\"  Keeping Britain Working: How medical technology can help reduce the cost of ill health to the UK economy  In November 2017, The Medical Technology Group launched its second major study, Keeping Britain Working ‚Äì How medical technology can help reduce the cost of ill health to the UK economy.http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Keeping-Britain- Working-Report-web.pdf Building on the Work Foundation's 2011 study,http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Adding-Value-The- Economic-and-Societal-Benefits-of-Medical-Technology.pdf the report explores the societal and economic impact of eight technologies: hip replacements; implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs); insulin pumps; diagnostics, including sepsis; fibroid embolisation; pain management; wound care; and coronary angioplasty. The report concluded that ¬£476 million in savings per year could be generated from the use of eight technologies in reduced long- term health costs and benefit payments.  The North-South NHS divide: how where you are ‚Äì not what you need ‚Äì dictates your care  A review of all 209 clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England ‚Äì published in August 2017 ‚Äì revealed wide variation in waiting times and access to medical technology for patients. The study The North-South NHS divide: how where you are - not what you need - dictates your care examined five clinical areas in NHS 18 Week Referral to Treatment and NHS Atlas of Variation data.http://www.mtg.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/The-North-South-NHS- divide-how-where-you-are-not-what-you-need-dictates-your-care-FINAL-low- res.pdf It found that nine out of ten of the poorest performing CCGs were based in the south of England and that almost three times more patients were waiting longer than 18 weeks for treatment compared with November 2012. The report made seven recommendations for improvement including greater transparency so that patients can compare the performance of their local health service and inspections of the poorest performing CCGs by NHS England.  D√©j√† Review ‚Äì what lessons can be learned from the past?  In June 2016, the Medical Technology Group published its report D√©j√† Review ‚Äì what lessons can be learned from the past?.https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B60cHNIWGkbiT0dTelYtQUd1c0k/view The report identified 17 different organisations or initiatives that have been launched with the aim of promoting innovation in the NHS over the previous ten years. In D√©j√† Review, the MTG noted that the NHS has historically and consistently failed to apply any learnings from the previous reviews, including 2011's much-quoted Innovation, Health and Wealth (IHW).  Unplanned admissions  In 2015 the Medical Technology Group contacted every acute trust and clinical commissioning group in England to identify the level of unplanned or emergency hospital admissions for urology, diabetes and heart failure. The research found that unplanned and emergency hospital admissions account for more than a third of all hospital admissions ‚Äì 5.4 million in total ‚Äì and two-thirds of all hospital bed days. It also found that the NHS spent ¬£434 million in 2013/14 treating over 180,000 hospital patients with an unplanned admission for a urinary tract infection; unplanned admissions owing to diabetic complications cost over ¬£200 million each year. Additional findings were that each NHS trust handles on average over 100 deaths each year from congestive heart failure, but with regional differences in approach and success rates: for example, 66% of presenting heart patients in the Southwest were treated in hospital compared to just 16% in the West Midlands.  Innovation, Health & Wealth Scorecard  In June 2015 the MTG published its review of the 2011 Innovation, Health & Wealth report by NHS Improvement & Efficiency, Innovation and Service Improvement. The scorecard reviewed progress against the six areas identified by the NHS as those where clinical commissioning groups and acute trusts could improve patient care through high impact innovations.http://www.mtg.org.uk/press-releases/innovation-health-and- wealth-scorecard The report revealed a very mixed picture, with both CCGs and trusts in some areas performing much worse than others, and some regions of the country drastically underperforming.  Infection control  Following a freedom of information request to all NHS acute trusts in England, in September 2014 the MTG published a report: Infection Prevention and Control ‚Äì Combatting a problem that has not gone away that revealed that the majority of Trusts were unaware of the full scale or the operational and financial impact of five common infections: sepsis; catheter-associated urinary tract infections; catheter-related blood infections; ventilator-associated pneumonia; and norovirus. The MTG called on the government to develop a strategy for using technology for infection prevention and control.  Hip and knee surgery  In November 2013, the MTG published a report into waiting times for knee and hip replacements on the National Health Service. The report, Hip and Knee Surgery: Combating Patient Lotteries, reviewed ten years of government data on knee and hip replacement, and data from freedom of information requests to acute NHS hospital trusts in England.http://www.mtg.org.uk/images/Spotlight/Hip_and_Knee_Replacements_- _Combating_Patient_Lotteries.pdf The report suggested that patient experiences vary significantly according to the financial calendar and where they live.  Work Foundation report  In November 2011, The Work Foundation published a report, Adding Value: The Economic and Societal Benefits of Medical Technology,http://www.theworkfoundation.com/DownloadPublication/Report/296_Adding%20value%20-%20The%20Economic%20and%20Societal%20Benefits%20of%20Medical%20Technology.pdf funded by a research grant from the MTG. The report, which was launched in the House of Commons, identified three key areas of benefits from medical technologies: * Improvements in health care (quality, efficiency and the empowerment of patients); * Improving quality of life and independent living (reducing fears and anxiety, increasing flexibility, and reducing the need for informal care and the burden on informal caregivers); * Labour market participation and productivity (increasing labour market participation, retaining skills and improving productivity).  Uterine artery/fibroid embolisation (UFE)  In 2011 the MTG and patient support group FEmISA published a report, The provision of and access to Uterine Artery/Fibroid,http://www.mtg.org.uk/files/UFEResearchReport.pdf a less invasive treatment for fibroids for women. The report, which was welcomed by the British Society of Interventional Radiologists, highlighted a lack of coherent commissioning in England, despite National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidelines recommending UFE as a first-line treatment for symptomatic fibroids.  Insulin pump provision  In 2010 the MTG made a freedom of information request to primary care trusts in England on the provision of insulin pumps to patients with Type 1 diabetes. It found the average to be 3.9 per cent compared to the 12 per cent benchmark recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The findings were the subject of an early day motion tabled by Adrian Sanders MP on 9 December 2010.  Medical technology  In 2004, the MTG's report Making the Economic Case for Medical Technology suggested that increasing the provision of medical technology can \\"help patients better manage their conditions\\" and lead a \\"longer and relatively healthy life\\".http://www.patientsorganizations.org/attach.pl/290/69/Economic%20Benefits%20of%20Medical%20Technology%20-%20MTG,%20June%202004.pdf It also suggested that by making greater use of technology there are cost benefits for the National Health Service. The report was the subject of an early day motion tabled by Ian Gibson MP. The motion was signed by 30 Members of Parliament.  Organisation  The MTG is chaired by Barbara Harpham, National Director of Heart Research UK. She has been quoted as saying that the UK lags behind other European countries in the take-up of medical technology.

Chantler was notable for devising a method with Norman Veale of measuring glomerular function in children and later researched diet and growth failure in children with renal impairment. Chantler was most notable for holding an independent review of public health evidence for standardised tobacco packaging that later became known as the Chantler Review that led to standardised packaging for tobacco and cigarette packets. Life Chantler was educated at Wrekin College between 1952 and 1957. Career From 1971 to 1972, Chantler spent a year working at Institute of Child Health at Great Ormond Street, working in the department of Immunology ran by John Soothill. In 1972, Chantler was appointed to a position at Guy's Hospital, before working for a year in the USA, working with Paediatric Nephrologist Malcolm Holliday, at the University of California, San Francisco studying growth in rats with chronic renal failure, before returning in 1973 to continue working at Guys under Stewart Cameron. From 1985 to 1988, Chantler was the General Manager of Guy's Hospital. From 1992 to 1998, Chantler was the principal of the United Medical and Dental Schools of Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. From 1997 to 2000, Chantler was the pro-vice chancellor of the University of London. From 2001 to 2008, Chantler was Chairman of the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children. Chantler was Consultant Paediatrician at Guy's Hospital from 1971 to 2000, and Fund Professor of Paediatric Nephrology at London University, 1990‚Äì2000, and emeritus since 2001. Chantler Review On 28 November 2013, Chantler was asked by Jane Ellison, the British Conservative Party politician, if he would be willing to review cigarette packaging and to undertake an independent review to determine whether standardised packaging would be beneficial to the public good. Chantler accepted the role. Ellison wrote to him on 27 November 2013 to define the Terms of Reference. On 29 November, Chantler accepted the role, with a reply to Jane Ellison, stating he did not have any conflict of interests. A Terms of References method were defined to focus exclusively on the public health aspects of cigarette packet packaging and were to exclude legal issues, such as competition, trade marking, or freedom of choice. An economic investigation was also expressly forbidden. The Terms also defined the methods available to submit research. In April 2014, Chantler produced the published report. In his conclusions, Chantler stated that it could not be proven conclusively that standardised cigarette packaging would reduce smoking, and that a large scale trial of such packaging would prove beneficial of such a trial would be difficult due to the number of actors, making it difficult to control. Chantler's most notable conclusion was that there was sufficient evidence to support standard packaging and tobacco control measures, that over time would return a modest reduction in the number of people smoking, particularly amongst children and young people. Chantler stated of the report, that he was persuaded that branded packaging plays an important role in encouraging young people to smoke, and that he was not convinced by the tobacco industries response that plain cigarette packages would increase smoking uptake.

Specifically he spoke of Tamerlane the famous conqueror who is known to be a blood-thirsty warrior conqueror in the Middle East, while Asian peoples revere him and regard him as a holy man who had spread the religion of Islam in their countries. In this respect, a book was issued by M. Amin Sheikho under the title: The Reality of Tamerlane the Great.The Reality of Tamerlane the Great, Mohammad Amin Sheikho  Cupping  The name of Mohammad Amin Sheikho is always referred to whenever ‚Äòcupping‚Äô is mentioned, for it is he who disclosed its correct rules. Following the death of M. Amin Sheikho his pupil, Prof. Abdul-Kadir al-Dayrani undertook scientific research about this operation with the participation of a large medical team composed of many professors and doctors specialised in various medical ailments.Documentary Film: Cupping, a Prophetic Medical Science in Its New Perspective, by Prof. A. K. John alias al-Dayrani When the results of the analysis of the blood extracted by the cupping operation were declared and many patients were healed completely after being cupped, the procedure soon spread widely and had a wide following in many societies. The results were published in many magazines and journals, and as a result, many medical people began to apply the procedure according to the exact and correct conditions that had been laid down.Cupping, a Prophetic Medical Science in Its New Perspective, book by Prof. A. K. John alis al-Dayrani The official broadcasting station of London (BBC), in one of its main news bulletins on 12/08/2001, declared the following: ‚ÄúThe Syrians were used to betake themselves to the British capital seeking for channels of treating their diseases of which they were desperate, or they came to make medical checkups or to perform some complicated medical operations. Such a way of acting on the part of the Syrians seemed very normal, but the unexpected act was the change in their destination from Great Britain towards the Syrian capital. A scientific medical team representing the British Royal Family began communications and dialogues with a group of Syrian physicians in Damascus in search for the cupping operation for the treatment of the hereditary disease, hemophilia. The disease confirmed its recovery in a number of sick people in Syria by means of cupping operationsAzzaman newspaper, Printed in Baghdad, London and Beirut, Editor in Chief Saad Albazzaz, No. 1004, 27 Aug 2001‚Äù.  Reason for Mentioning the Name of Al'lah over a Carcass  He emphasised the necessity of mentioning Al'lah's Name aloud over animals as they are being slaughtered, for when they hear Al'lah's Name their meat becomes pure and free of any microbes. Prof. al-Dayrani also subjected the ideas of his teacher, M. Amin Sheikho, in this field, to a scientific study. A great number of doctors and university professors carried out scientific research, the like of which had never been attempted before. They took many samples of the meat of cattle, some of which were slaughtered while mentioning Al'lah's Name aloud over them, while others were slaughtered without the benefit of this blessing. A comparative analysis of the outcome was then carried out. The results of this study were also published in a book issued on behalf of M. Amin Sheikho, entitled, Proclaiming God‚Äôs Love (The Scientific and Qur'anic Motivations for Halal Slaughter.Documentary Film: A Medical Discovery Which Gives Glad Tidings of Curing Cattle Mad Cow Disease and Bird Plague, By Prof. A.

Life Born at 16 College Street, Westminster, on 3 February 1824, he was youngest son of Lewis Hertslet, from a Swiss background, by his first wife, Hannah Harriet Jemima Cooke. Educated privately near Hounslow, he was on 23 March 1840 temporarily attached to the library of the Foreign Office under his father, who was then librarian. On 8 January 1842 he received a permanent appointment, on 28 August 1844 became second clerk, and a little later the senior clerk. On 1 April 1855 he became sub-librarian, and on 19 November 1857 librarian. Hertslet was involved in Foreign Office work through memoranda by him matching history, geography, or international law with major public questions which came before the government. With the post of librarian he combined, up to 1870, the agency for members of the diplomatic and consular services. After 1873, when John Brodribb Bergne died, Hertslet took his place as adviser on treaty matters. He was attached to the mission of Lord Beaconsfield to the Congress of Berlin in 1878, and was knighted for his services. He was also one of the delegates for the examination of the boundary between British and Dutch territory in Borneo in June 1889. Hertslet was retained at the Foreign Office after the normal retiring age of 65, to 2 February 1896. He was made C.B. on 21 February 1874, and K.C.B. on 20 August 1892. He died at his residence, Bellevue, Richmond after an operation, on 4 August 1902. He had resided at Richmond since 1852 and was active in local affairs.

According to the Preliminary Treaty of San Stefano and fixed by The Treaty of Berlin, from The Map of Europe by Treaty compiled by Edward Hertslet Hertslet continued a number of publications which his father had begun; the main ones were: * The Foreign Office List,'of which he was joint- editor from its third year (1865), and sole editor and proprietor from 1864 to his death. * Vols. xii.-xvi. with the index to the whole series and with the help of his eldest son, Sir Cecil Hertslet, vols. xvii.-xix. of the collection of treaties and conventions known as Hertslet's Commercial Treaties (1871-1895). * British and Foreign State Papers, of which he was responsible for vols. 27-82; his name appears only on later volumes. These state papers then became government publications. Hertslet also compiled The Map of Europe by Treaty, vols, i.-iii. 1875; vol. iv. 1896, as well as The Map of Africa by Treaty, 2 vols. 1894. He was author of Recollections of the Old Foreign Office (1901). Family Hertslet married Eden (died 1899), daughter of John Bull, clerk of the journals of the House of Commons. Of his nine sons and three daughters, six sons and a daughter survived him. His third son, Godfrey L. P.

Recent molecular studies suggest that amphisbaenians are grouped with the Lacertidae, in a group named the Lacertibaenia. Lacertoids have a wide geographic distribution. The Lacertidae are found throughout Europe and Asia, with a major radiation endemic to Africa. The Teiidae are diverse in South America, but some members of the group occur in southern North America as well. The Amphisbaenia are especially widespread, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. The origins of the group are unclear. The oldest definitive lacertoid is the amphisbaenian Plesiorhineura, from the early Paleocene of North America. Given that it resembles modern worm lizards, the lacertoids most likely appeared and diversified in the Cretaceous.

Bloodgood produced predominantly abstract paintings often relating to the works of earlier artists from Jackson Pollock to Paul C√©zanne. He co-founded the AC Project Room in Lower Manhattan, and held solo exhibitions in several US cities, including New York, San Francisco, and Washington D.C., and at the Andreas Binder Gallery in Germany. His group exhibitions included shows at the Saatchi Gallery in London.http://www.saatchigallery.com/artists/paul_bloodgood.htm He was a 2009 Guggenheim Fellow. Life Paul Bloodgood was born in Nyack, NY and awarded a BA in painting from Yale University in 1982. He moved to New York City in 1986 and received his MFA from Maine College of Art in 2002. He taught painting at Rutgers University, Cooper Union and the Savannah College of Art, and was a recipient of multiple awards, including the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship in 2009. Michael Kimmelman wrote in the New York Times, \\"Mr. Bloodgood pushes things right to the edge, but not over it. The gestures are dizzying, yet not empty or simply derivative of the Abstract Expressionists whose art he inevitably evokes. There's a genuine and exuberant emotional quality here that suggests Mr. Bloodgood is someone to watch.\\" A 2012 Art in America review of his second solo show at the Newman Popiashvili Gallery described Objects in Pieces (2011) as having \\"a sense of being in the thick of things, a zooming in, as opposed to a deliberate fracturing and arranging. The accentuated density of elements and the intensity of this particular painting make it his most accessible and instantly gratifying canvas to date.\\"https://www.artinamericamagazine.com/reviews/paul-bloodgood/ It explained that Bloodgood had recently suffered a head injury, the result of a 2010 mugging, \\"leaving him with an optical disorder that prevents him from recognizing a whole object if he sees only parts of it... the artist has since changed his process and is relying on his impairment, rather than collages, to create his fragmentary abstractions.\\" \\"Standing in front of Bloodgood‚Äôs oils,\\" it continued, \\"one is deeply impressed by the artist‚Äôs offbeat perspective and resolute pursuit of his own language.\\" From 1989 to 2001, Bloodgood operated AC Project Room, an independent, artist-run commercial gallery, initially on Renwick Avenue, later moving to Broome Street in SoHo, New York, along with Alissa Friedman and fellow artist Anne Chu. Together, they organized early, solo exhibits of many important artists' works, including: Louise Lawler, Matthew Ritchie, Isa Genzken, Fiona Banner, Kai Althoff, Verne Dawson, Doug Aitken, Kiki Smith, Jane & Louise Wilson, and Josiah McElheny.https://www.artist-info.com/users/publicpagegallery/1284 For four years in the early 2000s he worked as a colorist, creating a range of paint colours for Martha Stewart and Lowe's Home Centers based on Paul Klee's color theories from his time at the Bauhaus.

The tree is one of a number found to have a very high resistance to Dutch Elm Disease, on a par with, if not greater than, the hybrid cultivar 'Sapporo Autumn Gold'. In the Madrid study, the appearance of the tree was rated 4.5 / 5, the most attractive of the selected cultivars. 'Ademuz' was introduced to the UK in 2014, by Hampshire & Isle of Wight Branch, Butterfly Conservation, as part of an assessment of DED-resistant cultivars as potential hosts of the endangered White-letter Hairstreak.Brookes, A. H. (2020). Disease-resistant elm cultivars. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. Brookes, A. H. (2020). Great Fontley Elm Trial, 2020 Report. Butterfly Conservation, Lulworth, England. Description 'Ademuz' grew at 100 cm per annum, the fastest of the U. minor clones under assessment at Puerta de Hierro, Madrid. The tree is often monopodial, its branches devoid of corky tissue. The leaves, on 5 mm petioles, are ovate, typically acuminate at the apex, the average length and width 54 √ó 34 mm, the margins doubly serrate. Foliar density relative to 'Sapporo Autumn Gold' is described as 'medium'. DNA analysis by UPM in 2019 has confirmed that 'Ademuz' is pure Ulmus minor. File:Ulmus minor 'Ademuz' leaf.jpg'Ademuz' leaf File:Ulmus minor 'Aemuz' winter GFF.jpgErect structure of untrained sapling Pests and diseases In inoculation trials conducted in 2008, 'Ademuz' sustained approximately 10% damage (assumed to be wilting rather than die-back) against a score of c. 45% for the benchmark-resistant cultivar 'Sapporo Autumn Gold'. In 2009 'Ademuz' scored c. 18%, and Sapporo c. 21%. Ergo, 'Ademuz' would appear to have a level of resistance unprecedented in a European species. However in Italian elm trials, some Spanish U. minor clones have shewn a greater susceptibility to elm yellows, a phytoplasma not known in either the UK or Spain, than those of any other provenance. Whether 'Ademuz' shares this susceptibility has yet to be established. Cultivation The location of the parent tree is not known but believed to be near the eponymous town on the outskirts of Valencia. The climate of Valencia is typically dry and frost-free, with an annual average rainfall total of @450 mm, the majority falling in autumn. Rainfall from January is about 30-40 mm per month until July, when it falls to @10 mm. 'Ademuz' has also thrived at four sites in Hampshire, England, as part of Butterfly Conservation's elm trials, where the rainfall is approximately double the Valencia total, and geology ranges from chalk to impermeable clays. However, it has made minimal growth on marshy ground, where the predominant vegetation is Hemlock Water Dropwort Oenanthe crocata. 'Ademuz' has proven particularly resilient where exposed to sea winds, notably where grown on Horsea Island in Portsmouth Harbour, Hampshire. Etymology 'Ademuz' (Valencian 'Ademus') is derived from the Arabic 'Ad-damus', which appears to mean 'impregnable', and the origin of the English words 'adamant' and 'diamond'.

On the west side of the Rhine, it forms the border between the districts of Neustadt-S√ºd and K√∂ln-Bayenthal. On the east bank of the Rhine it forms the border between K√∂ln-Deutz and K√∂ln-Poll. The two track South Bridge is used by railway traffic, pedestrians and cyclists. Since its construction it has been used mainly by freight services. Some Intercity-Express services were also scheduled to run over the bridge before the rebuilding of K√∂ln Messe/Deutz station.  History  Collapse of the South Bridge on 9 July 1908 K√∂ln-Poll, South Bridge (pylons on the east side of the Rhine). Note the outriggers mounted on the pylons carrying high-voltage power lines. The South Bridge was built from 1906 (start of construction: 8 November 1906) to 1910 for 5.5 million marks by the Prussian state railways under the direction of the head of the board of works, Fritz Beermann. The design was in the hands of Frederick Dircksen, who also initially directed the construction. The designs of the stonework at the portals, the ramps and the piers was carried out by the Berlin architect Franz Schwechten, who designed the corresponding work for the Hohenzollern Bridge. It was officially put into service on 5 April 1910. The construction of sidewalks on both sides of the bridge was funded by the city of Cologne. An opening ceremony was dispensed with as a result of a severe accident in 1908 (during the building of the middle truss arch), in which eight workers were killed. The steel main structure has three spans (101.5 m + 165 m + 101.5 m) with a total length of 368 m and a width of 10.34 m. The pylons are built in a Romanesque Revival style and furnished with rich sculptural decorations, which were made by the Berlin sculptor Gotthold Riegelmann (1864‚Äì1935). In the Second World War, the South Bridge was largely destroyed in an air raid on 6 January 1945. The central span lying in the stream had to be demolished and therefore was no longer available for the reconstruction. In May 1946, the bridge was first opened provisionally with a single track and later rebuilt for DM 10 million, resuming operations on 1 October 1950. As with its northern counterpart, the Hohenzollern Bridge, the reconstruction did not include the decorative parts of the portals and pylons. Part of the square stone block was used for the reconstruction of the stone arches over the Rheinallee and on the bank at Porz. The total length of the bridge is now 536 m. Today, the bridge is owned by Deutsche Bahn. The city of Cologne is responsible for the maintenance and care of the sidewalks.  Conservation  The bridge is now heritage-listed for its historical importance as a railway because of its steel truss construction and partially preserved Romanesque Revival stonework. The Rheinische Verein f√ºr Denkmalpflege und Landschaftsschutz (Rhenish Association for heritage conservation and landscape protection) presented it as the monument of the month in May 2006, in order to draw attention to its condition. The renovation of sidewalks and the pylons located on both sides of the Rhine began in December 2009. The costs amounted to about ‚Ç¨5.1 million.

Her work has been shown in numerous venues, including the Fotomuseum Winterthur, the Berlinische Galerie and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.  Life and work  After completing her studies at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart in 1997, where she studied under Joseph Kosuth and Joan Jonas, Kriemann enrolled in the Programme de recherche at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 2000. She has taken part in various artist residency programs, including in Moscow, Stockholm, Cairo, and Vienna. Together with Aleksander Komarov, she is one of the cofounders of the artist-run initiative AIR Berlin Alexanderplatz. She is represented by the galleries Wilfried Lentz and RaebervonStenglin (2009‚Äì16). Kriemann's artistic practice is notable for the expansiveness of its conception of photography. Her work examines the act of documentation as a photographic principle with regard to temporality and material processuality in specific sociohistorical contexts. Her methods range from archival research to field studies to the use of various photographic imaging and printing processes. Pechblende, an ongoing project begun in 2014, deals with the extraction of pitchblende (uraninite) for uranium production by the Wismut mining company in the Ore Mountains in the former East Germany between 1946 and 1991. These activities contributed significantly to the Soviet Union‚Äôs nuclear arsenal. The radiation emitted by pitchblende exposes photosensitive paper when placed in direct contact with it. Kriemann has taken advantage of this quality to create a series of autoradiographs in which the mineral itself becomes a kind of \\"camera.\\" A spin-off from that project is Falsche Kamille, Wilde M√∂hre, Bitterkraut (2016). The title lists three plants (false chamomile, wild carrot, ox tongue) that can be found growing in the area mined by Wismut, which is designated as contaminated for the next 100,000 years. From these plants, Kriemann made both photograms (Cycle 1) and heliogravures (Cycle 2). For Cycle 1, she dried plants, made photograms of them in the darkroom using the flash from her smartphone, and then ground them to make pigments. These were used to print color blocks behind lists of the substances found in each plant, including several ‚Äì gadolinium, uranium, aluminum, copper, nickel, and zinc ‚Äì that are used in manufacturing smartphones, camera lenses, and LEDs. For Cycle 2, she photographed plants in situ and then made heliogravure prints using the pigments obtained from them. The subject of the image and the material from which it is made are thus one and the same. A similar principle is at work in Duskdust (2014‚Äì16). Here, rocks from a former limestone mine on the Furillen peninsula, on the Swedish island of Gotland, were ground into dust, which was then incorporated into a series of silk- screen prints, so that the material becomes the ground of the image. Ray (2013) marked a new stage of Kriemann's investigation of the world as an analogue to photography, a \\"recording system\\" for human-caused ecological processes. Ray dealt with radioactive rare-earth elements, which today are essential for the production of smartphones and LEDs. These were extensively studied in the late 1880s at the Barringer Hill mine in Llano, Texas, which now lies beneath Lake Buchanan. During a 2013 research trip Kriemann explored the lake, on whose bottom the ores now rest, to assess its photographic suitability as a light-refracting optical lens for the mine below. Whereas the Texas mine was approached from the perspective of a material archaeology of ecological, economic, political, and chemical processes, Ashes and Broken Brickwork of a Logical Theory (2009‚Äì10) dealt with actual archaeology. Here, Kriemann juxtaposed her own photographs and aerial images of the Syrian desert and excavation sites in Mesopotamia with pictures from the photographic archive of the writer Agatha Christie. As a photographer for the British Museum, Christie accompanied archaeological expeditions to northern Iraq in 1928 and Syria in 1930 ‚Äì trips that provided inspiration for novels such as Murder on the Orient Express. The archaeologists of that era were no longer interested simply in making spectacular finds, but also in classifying fragmentary artifacts and assembling them into a coherent picture of the past. However, this was also a period of violent anticolonial uprisings in the region, which sometimes ended in bloodshed. Through this combination of historical images and her own photographs, which has been published in an artist's book and shown in three exhibitions, at KIOSK in Ghent, the K√ºnstlerhaus Stuttgart, and the Berlinische Galerie, Kriemann placed historical documents in a new order and reflected on the construction of history in connection with colonial power over historiography. One Time One Million (2006‚Äì09) began with a 1942 Hasselblad Ross HK7 camera, which Kriemann purchased at auction, together with a supply of 1940s-vintage film, while doing research in Sweden. The HK7 model was designed for the Swedish Army by Victor Hasselblad in 1940, based on a German aerial-surveillance camera. Kriemann used the antique camera and film to take aerial photographs of Tensta and Rinkeby, two residential districts on the outskirts of Stockholm. In response to a housing shortage, Sweden's \\"Million Program\\" created homes for a million people between 1964 and 1974; today the country is a global migration destination. In an installation and an artist's book published by Roma Publications, Kriemann juxtaposed her aerial images with ornithological photographs by Hasselblad from the archive of the Hasselblad Foundation, and with pictures taken from military aircraft from the Swedish Military Archives. The title of the installation and artist's book 12 650 000 (2005‚Äì08) refers to the weight, in kilograms, of the \\"Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper\\" (heavy load‚Äìbearing body) in Berlin, which was built in 1941‚Äì42 in the context of Albert Speer‚Äôs remodeling of Berlin and served as a test structure for a gigantic triumphal arch envisioned as the southern gateway to Adolf Hitler‚Äôs planned \\"Welthauptstadt Germania\\" (\\"World Capital Germania\\"). Kriemann counters the massiveness of this historical document with written and photographic press coverage, dating as far back as 1950, that attempts ‚Äì with sometimes divergent results ‚Äì to comprehend the physical existence of the Schwerbelastungsk√∂rper. Kriemann's method of incorporating archival material into her work, and of examining the technological factors underlying the production of photography, originates in a questioning of who is the initiator of photographs and what historical conditions they are created under. Her approach to photography thus has less to do with representation than with an interest in photography as a technological tool for the formation of history. Besides having shown internationally in cities including Basel, Toronto, Shanghai, Vienna, Vancouver, Paris, and Rotterdam, Kriemann has also created sixteen artist's books as multiples since 1998. An integral part of Kriemann's work, these books are created in close collaboration with designers and authors. As a site-independent, accessible archive, they convert the work into a different format, described by the artist as a \\"camera obscura,\\" whose pages are \\"exposed\\" when the books are opened and perused. In 2017, Susanne Kriemann joined the faculty of the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design as a professor of fine-art photography. The artist lives and works in Berlin and Karlsruhe.

In 1973 the Penny Lane Mall was built in downtown Calgary, Alberta, preserving the facade of a block of older buildings on 8th Avenue SW. According to The Calgary Herald the mall preserved the facade of one of Calgary's first hospitals, the first Colonel Belcher Hospital, a military hospital opened in 1918. The Calgary Herald reported shoppers would be surrounded by \\"an atmosphere of quality and elegance\\". In 1983 The Calgary Herald's Tom Keyser profiled Bob Hutchison, the mall's long- time shoe-shine-boy -- one of only three individuals who still operated a shoe-shine stand in Calgary. Hutchison said the mall's management considered him a \\"drawing card\\", so he was charged no rent. In 1985 Eaton's opened a large department store across the street from the mall. The Calgary Herald reported vendors in the mall welcomed the shoppers the Eaton's store would attract. According to the 2002 edition of The Canadian Rockies: A Colourguide the Penny Lane Mall was part of an extensive blocks of properties connected by covered walkways at second floor level. The walkways, called +15 because the walkways were approximately 15 feet above street level, allowed shoppers to \\"cruise the malls in comfort even if the weather is frightful.\\" The guide said, in 2002, that the walkways gave shirtsleeve access to 400 stores.

He was one of Malik's main companions and had a tremendous influence in recording the positions of the school. Ibn al-Qasim was the source for Sahnun in his Mudawwana, a record of Malik's teachings. He has the same position in the Maliki school as Muhammad al-Shaybani has in the Hanafi school, in so far as both of them transmitted their respective schools and made free use of ijtihad (independent reasoning). Ibn al-Qasim had opinions which differed from those of Malik, to the point that it was said that he was dominated by opinion. Life Ibn al-Qasim's full name was 'Abd ar-Rahman ibn ibn al-Qasim al-'Utaqi although he was well known as Ibn al-Qasim. He was born in Egypt in a mosque known as the 'Utaqi Mosque in the mid 8th century CE at a time when the Abbasids took control of the Muslim world from the Umayyads. Ibn al- Qasim's origins were from the Palestinian town of Ramla. He was a descendant from the slaves of Ta'if whom the Prophet Muhammad had freed. Ibn al-Qasim's father was in the Dewan, and he used the money he inherited from him for his studies. He travelled from Egypt to Medina after what is recorded as a visionary dream and after having been drawn to gatherings of religious knowledge in Egypt. In Medina, he met Malik as well as Ibn Wahb, another of Malik's famous companions. Ibn al-Qasim kept the company of Malik for the relatively long period of about twenty years. It was from him that he learned his fiqh (jurisprudence). In Medina he also met Al-Layth, Ibn al-Majishun and Muslim ibn Khalid al-Zanji. Many people related from him and consulted him about Malik's fatwas. Ibn Wahb used to say, \\"If you want this business ‚Äì meaning the fiqh of Malik ‚Äì you must have Ibn al-Qasim. He is unique in it\\". His transmission of the Muwatta is considered to be the soundest transmission, and Sahnun learned the contents of the Mudawwana, the most comprehensive collection of Maliki fiqh, from him. Thus he can be considered as the main transmitter of Maliki fiqh, for the Mudawwana is its chief source.Excerpt from the section on Imam Malik in The Four Imams by Muhammad Abu Zahrah Ibn al- Qasim was generally known for his vast knowledge. When Malik was asked about him and Ibn Wahb, he replied that Ibn Wahb was a knowledgeable man whilst Ibn al-Qasim was a true faqih (jurist).Qadi Iyad, Tartib al-Madarik, Vol.3, p.245. He was also known as having ascetic qualities and spent much of his time reciting the Quran such that he would finish many readings in a short space of time. On his return to Egypt he refused to marry the daughters of wealthy officials and generally kept clear of the ruling class. He died in Egypt at the age of 63 in the month of Safar, 191 AH (806 CE) three days after returning from a trip to Mecca. Ibn al-Qasim left behind him two sons Abd ar- Rahman and 'Umar.Qadi Iyad, Tartib al-Madarik, Vol.3, p.260  References  8th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Egyptian Maliki scholars 806 deaths 750 births 8th-century Arabs 8th-century jurists 9th-century jurists ","title":"Ibn al-Qasim"},{"id":"41215230","text":"Carolyn M.

Early life  Purdie is believed to have been born in Scotland by 1743; however, his exact birth date and exact place of birth are unknown. He was trained at an early age in the skills of printing in his motherland. His immigration to the American British colonies is not known for sure; however, by 1764 he took up residence in colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. At that time he was employed by the then current Williamsburg printer Joseph Royle, as an apprentice.  Mid life  Purdie succeeded Royle as editor of the Virginia Gazette on his death in 1766. He formed a partnership with John Dixon until 1774, when Dixon developed a new partnership with William Hunter, the printer at Williamsburg. Purdie then ran a third Virginia Gazette that was similar in articles to the other two Virginia Gazette's being printed in Williamsburg at the time. The newspaper's motto was, \\"Always for Liberty and the Public Good.\\" Purdie became the official Virginia \\"public printer\\" in Williamsburg in 1775, an esteemed lucrative position. He also became the postmaster in Williamsburg by October of that year.  Dwelling  Purdie owned a residence in colonial Williamsburg on a half-acre lot. The legal description of its location is Block 9 Lot 24 and is known further today as building 28A. The house was reconstructed by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation based on the original underground foundation. It is located on the south side of Duke of Gloucester Street next to the King Arm's Tavern about a block from the Capitol. Purdie purchased the Williamsburg lot and house from the estate of Joanna McKenzie in 1767 with a Dr. James Carter being the administrator. He paid \\"300 pounds current money of Virginia.\\" The lot already had by 1707 \\"one good dwelling house thereon.\\" Purdie lived in the house and ran a store that sold yarn goods and wearing apparel from it.  Business  There is good reason to believe that Purdie's printing shop business was located in what is known today as Tarpley's Store. It is located four lots west on lot #20 on Duke of Gloucester Street on the southeast corner at Botetourt Street.  Family  Purdie with his first wife Mary had at least two children. Mary died sometime in or before 1772. It appears that Alexander Purdie, her husband, was selling off her remains of her women's hats business after her death - at or below cost according to his advertisements of July and August 1772. Purdie married Peachy Devenport in December of that year.  Later life and death  Purdie suffered from dropsy in his later years. He died at Williamsburg in 1779.  Political  Purdie favored the American revolutionary patriots‚Äô cause and his Virginia Gazette newspaper articles reflected that voice. In the time period of the American Revolution, Purdie changed his front page design title several times to reflect his solidarity for the cause of the patriots. At first the masthead read, \\"Thirteen United Colonies\\" and \\"United we stand, divided we fall.\\" Later, an image of a coiled snake was on the masthead with the moto \\"Don‚Äôt tread on me\\" displaced front and center. It was subtitled \\"High Heaven to Gracious Ends directs the Storm!\\"  Legacy  Purdie's Virginia Gazette was the first American newspaper to publish the complete full text of the United States Declaration of Independence, which was printed on July 26, 1776.

The Orkney and Shetland by-election was a Parliamentary by-election. It returned one Member of Parliament to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, elected by the first past the post voting system. Vacancy Cathcart Wason had been Liberal Unionist MP for the seat of Orkney and Shetland since 1900. In July 1902, he decided to cross the floor of the House to sit with the Liberal opposition. Leaving the Liberal Unionist Party, he cited Government policy on the army, the Education Bill and the Irish land question.Aberdeen Journal, 30 Jul 1902 He faced criticism from the Unionists in his constituency and following pressure, he resigned his seat on 7 October 1902 to contest the subsequent by-election. Electoral history Since 1885, the seat had been always comfortably returned the Liberal Party candidate. Then the seat was surprisingly gained by Wason; albeit with a narrow majority of forty votes, standing as a Liberal Unionist in 1900. Candidates Cathcart Wason in 1902 outside the Houses of Parliament *Fifty- four-year-old sitting MP Cathcart Wason chose to fight his seat again, standing as an Independent Liberal. He had hoped to stand as the official Liberal candidate, but the local Liberal Association chose not to back him.Aberdeen Journal, 18 Aug 1902 Although born in Scotland he moved to New Zealand and had served as an Independent Member of Parliament there. He returned to the UK in 1900 in time for the general election to stand as a Liberal Unionist.

They eventually selected 59-year-old Theodore Angier as their candidate to defend the seat. He had no connection with the islands and was a member of the Liberal Unionist Council.

Wood was a member of the London County Council for Central Hackney from 1892 and from 1897 he was leader of the Progressive Party and also served as Chairman of the council from 1898-99.

The game uses the Powered by the Apocalypse engine originally designed for Apocalypse World and used in Monsterhearts and other games. The game is advertised as having old school style with modern rules. The text of the game was released under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. Dungeon World raised just over $80,000 from 2400 backers on Kickstarter before it was released, and was the 2012 Golden Geek RPG of the Year, the 2012 Indie RPG Game of the Year (as well as winning the awards for Best Support and Best Production) and was the Best Rules Gold Winner in the 2013 Ennie Awards.  Setting  The setting for Dungeon World is created by the game master following the instruction of \\"Draw maps and leave blank spaces\\" allowing details to emerge in play.  Gameplay  Dungeon World uses the Powered by the Apocalypse engine. The game uses six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and a character class model with choices of Bard, Cleric, Fighter, Immolator, Paladin, Ranger, Thief, or Wizard. Like other Powered by the Apocalypse games, actions in Dungeon World are called moves. When a player character makes a move, the player rolls two six-sided dice and adds the appropriate ability modifier. On a result of 10+ the move succeeds without complication. On a result of 7-9 the move partially succeeds or succeeds with a problem, allowing the GM to make a move of their own. On a result of 6 or less there is trouble (which may or may not mean failure). The character gains an experience point and the GM makes a move. Characters share general moves and gain unique moves from their class. To represent character relationships and facilitate quick setup, each class lists bonds that show, before the game starts, how the characters see each other, filling one name of one other player character in the blank space of each bond. Example bonds are: * _______________ owes me their life, whether they admit it or not. * I have sworn to protect _______________. * I worry about the ability of _______________ to survive in the dungeon. * _______________ is soft, but I will make them hard like me.

Both painting and drawing play a central part in his artistic oeuvre. In his work Wagner returns repeatedly to a geometric formal language that is reduced in its composition and abstractly constructed.  Life and work  Alexander Wagner completed his studies at the Universit√§t der K√ºnste Berlin (Berlin University of the Arts) in 2006 having been a ‚ÄòMeistersch√ºler‚Äô there. Even prior to his graduation Wagner took part in group exhibitions in Berlin, Zurich and Istanbul, as well as group shows in the United States and Italy. Alexander Wagner engages predominantly with the subject of painting. Thus drawings, watercolours, silkscreen prints, gouache and acrylic paintings have a fixed place in Wagner‚Äôs repertoire. The artist‚Äôs work is particularly notable for its formal language.Alexander Wagner (Hrsg.): Alexander Wagner. Revolver Publishing, Berlin 2009. He chooses clean, geometric forms, amongst others, and carries these over into his subjects, \\"or even onto the picture‚Äôs topic, which has no inherent geometry, like clouds or rain, for example,\\" as Friedrich Meschde has explained. Wagner‚Äôs works seem thus to be reduced to something essential, using colours as a starting point. His approach to form in his work is also interesting. For example, Alexander Wagner has produced photographs in which a chance description of space in terms of geometry can be recognised, in the form of an everyday object. This can, in turn, serve as the basis for a drawing in which, unlike a photograph, \\"visible things progress\\". His newest works are increasingly wall paintings, as have been on display recently in the Kunsthalle Bielefeld, amongst other venues. With this Wagner focuses on the spatial intervention, which relates to the site‚Äôs exhibition architecture and changes how this can be experienced spatially. Alexander Wagner is represented by the gallery RaebervonStenglin in Z√ºrich. He lives and works in Berlin.

In the 1970s, they were already more than 100 all over the three continents. In 1980, the Charter of the NGO launched a new functioning that established a partnership with local organizations: the assistantship developed during the first years disappeared to a real cooperative work. This original method guided, from then on, all actions carried out by Fr√®res des Hommes. In 2011, Fr√®res des Hommes celebrated its 45th anniversary. Philosophy Fr√®res des Hommes bases its activities on a long term partnership with its representatives from underdeveloped countries (non governmental organizations, associations, movements‚Ä¶). This imminence implies sharing ideals and goals, supporting new or existing initiatives, as well as co-responsibility. The projects supported by the NGO are designed and set up by local communities, with the help of local organizations.

Pecoraro Vincent L. Pecoraro, professor at the University of Michigan, is a researcher in bioinorganic chemistry and inorganic chemistry. He is a specialist in the chemistry and biochemistry of manganese, vanadium, and metallacrown chemistry. He is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science  Biography  Pecoraro was born in Freeport, NY in August 1956; shortly after, his family relocated to California where he spent the majority of his childhood. On completing high school, he continued his education at the University of California, Los Angeles graduating with his B.S. in Biochemistry in 1977 and pursued his Ph.D. in Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley working under Ken Raymond. After gaining his Ph.D., he worked with W. Wallace Cleland at the University of Wisconsin- Madison for a three-year post-doc. In 1984, he was appointed Assistant Professor in the University of Michigan Department of Chemistry.  Scientific Achievements   Metallacrown  Metallacrowns and related organic crown ethers a) 12-crown-4 b)12-MCFe(III)N-4 c) 15-crown-5 d) 15-MCCu(II)N-5 Metallacrowns are a class of cyclic compounds that contain metal ions and non- metals in repeating units. Vincent L. Pecoraro and Myoung Soo Lah reported the first metallacrown in 1989 and these compounds have since grown into their own field of research with numerous new applications. One of the most interesting aspects of these compounds is their diversity. The ring size can be changed by incorporating new ligands or different metals into the frame work, which leads to the internal cavity also changing size. As such, specific ions can be selectively trapped in the center by tuning the structure of the metallacrown and also, by changing the environment, such as the solvent. Due to these unique properties and the inherent greenness associated with metallacrown synthesis (typically high yield, one step, benign solvent), this is still an active research topic for the Pecoraro group and many other scientists around the world. The Pecoraro group is currently working on using metallacrowns with selective binding for a variety of biological applications. One application is using metallacrowns for medicinal imaging. Currently, gadolinium (Gd) is used in MRI as a contrasting agent in combination with a chelating ligand. Unfortunately, if Gd is freed from its chelating agent, Gd is rather toxic to humans. These gadolinium chelates present many health hazards and can even lead to death, though it is an uncommon occurrence and typically is only seen in patients with kidney issues. Luckily, this same metal can also be selectively and very strongly trapped in a metallacrown motif. Currently, the group is working on subjecting this system to a variety of conditions as seen in the body such as different pH‚Äôs and also, various compounds and metals that may also bind to the metallacrown to ensure that the toxic Gd is not displaced from the metallacrown. Other potential uses of metallacrowns in the body include hydrolyzing phosphate diesters, a key linkage component in RNA and DNA. Another part of the Pecoraro group research with metallacrowns focuses on their application as single-molecule magnet. Metallacryptate can be thought of as a metallacrown in three dimensions with a manganese oxide trapped in the middle. The most interesting thing about this compound is that this molecule acts like a single-molecule magnet. Currently, the group is continuing to work on fully understanding this system with the ultimate goal of applying it to memory storage devices. Investigating for Lanthanide separation  Manganese  Catalase structure The Pecoraro group is also investigating the role of manganese in biological systems with particular interest in manganese (Mn) based enzymes. These enzymes have a wide variety of critical roles in the body including acting as an anti-oxidant (superoxide dismutase) and protecting the cell from oxidation damage (catalase). The group is also studying the oxygen evolving complex, which catalyzes the oxidation of water. This compound plays a key role in plant photosynthesis of converting CO2 and water to form sugars. The Pecoraro group approaches these manganese based compounds by first creating model systems and studying them. The group was able to synthesize a dimanganese complex where the Mn atoms had the same separation as that found in the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) while also having a similar ligand environment. This compound has also been shown to have similar catalytic activity to that of catalase. The information gained from this system has led to new proposals regarding how the OEC occurs. One mechanism involves successive oxidations of OEC by hydrogen abstraction. The group tested the viability of this mechanism via use of thermodynamic calculations and studies of their mock system to find that this is indeed a possible mechanism. This dimeric system was also found to exist with variety of different manganese oxidation states. These oxidation states have also been shown to exist in catalase. By observing the binding of a hydroxide to one of the manganese, an unsymmetrical dimer is created.  Vanadium  His group has interest in vanadium for bioinorganic applications. Vanadium can be naturally found in enzymes within certain marine animals. One of these enzyme types, nitrogenases, are responsible for converting nitrogen gas to ammonia and can then be accessed by plants, which is critical to their development. The other type, haloperoxidases, takes bromine from seawater along with hydrogen peroxide and converts them into organobromine compounds. These unique vanadium complexes, as well as others are found in some terrestrial beings such as mushrooms. Additionally, these compounds may provide very useful for humans as they have been found to help people with diabetes by improving glucose control. The Pecoraro group has taken these interesting applications of vanadium and started research to more fully understand them. In particular, the haloperoxidases have been a main focus on research. First, the group synthesized vanadium complexes to mock the vanadium haloperoxidases in order to gain an understanding of the mechanism. Not only did their system efficiently catalyze the reaction, but they were also able to collect valuable kinetic data and come up with a proposed catalytic cycle as seen below. The information showed that an acid/base was necessary for catalysis to occur. With this information in hand, efforts are underway to understand how these complexes are activated naturally to allow halide oxidation. Also, they are working to understand the structures of the inactive forms of these vanadium based haloperoxidases. This information will provide significant insight into how these vanadium haloperoxidases are found and operate in these biological systems, which will in turn take the group one step closer to being able to apply vanadium compounds to diabetes treatment. Proposed catalytic cycle for vanadium catalyzed production of organohalides  Metallopeptides  Observed binding geometries in peptides The group also conducts research on the role of heavy metals in the body and how to alleviate their toxic effects. Heavy metals such as lead and mercury are toxic in the human body and can lead to life-threatening diseases such as Minamata disease. Unfortunately, the human body is essentially defenseless again these metals. The problem with mercury and lead is that they displace zinc in enzymes, thus leading to a halt in reactivity. They also strongly coordinate sulfur often leading to misfolding of proteins containing cysteines. Arsenic is also another metal of concern as it replaces nitrogen in DNA causing a deviation from its desired and necessary role. All of these metals, as well as many others have serious health consequences. Although humans have no way to deal with these heavy metals, bacteria have been found to developed ways to remove these metals to prevent toxic side effects. This information is what provides motivation for the Pecoraro group. The initial studies have focused on understanding the binding of these heavy metals to peptides. Arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and cadmium (Cd) all were used in systems with various peptides. Arsenic was found to bind to peptides via primarily a trigonal-pyramidal or tetrahedral shape in a manner that is both kinetically and thermodynamically favorable. Mercury on the other hand was found to bind to two sulfur atoms in separate peptides via a linear shape, thus causing the formation of a two strand coiled coil. It was also shown that under certain conditions, termed stepwise aggregation- deprotonation, mercury can be made to bind three sulfurs thus yielding a three strand coiled coil with an Hg in the middle. Cadmium was the last heavy metal studied in these systems. It was found that Cd also binds to three separate sulfurs, though it does not resemble the Hg system in that it does not form a linear binding shape within a two strand coiled coil. This information obtained gives valuable information on how these heavy metals interfere with proteins and their folding. This is the first step in understanding and potentially, solving heavy metal binding in the body.  De Novo-Designed Peptides  At least a third of all proteins contain at least one metal. A few examples of these proteins can be seen above (catalase and oxygen evolving complex). When considering the various roles that these metalloproteins play, ranging from hydrolytic bond cleavage to photosynthetic roles in plants, it is rather astounding how little is actually understood about the metal's role. In order to address this issue, the Pecoraro group has undertaken de novo or \\"from scratch\\" protein design. This methodology allows for a unique amino acid sequence, binding site of the metal, and finally, folding of the protein. The Pecoraro group has specific interest in the placement of the binding site as they believe that changing the environment of the metal will ultimately cause a dramatic effect in all processes involving the metal such as catalytic activity, rate, and binding strength. His group has created the first bimetallic artificial protein. This protein contains both a mercury, for stability, and zinc, for catalytic activity, and has been proven to perform various hydrolytic reactions of natural proteins. Where most synthetic compounds fail to perform similar to natural proteins, notably carbonic anhydrase, this artificial metalloprotein has excelled showing a similar proficiency to carbonic anhydrase, one of the fastest and highly catalytic proteins in the world.

The class is capable of hauling either heavy passenger traffic or goods trains on both lowland and mountainous routes. At the time of its entry into service, the Class 1044 was the most powerful class of four-axle locomotives in the world. Until the introduction of the Class 1016 (Taurus) locomotives, it was the showpiece class of the √ñBB. All members of the class, except its two prototypes, have now been converted into Class 1144 locomotives. History After the success of the earlier Class 1042, and the success of the ASEA-made Class 1043 the Austrian Railways decided to acquire locally-made thyristor locomotives. The first 2 prototypes were made in 1976, both featuring different bridging structures: 1044.01 featured an 8-bridge structure and 1044.02 featured a 4-bridge structure. Series production started in 1977 with 1044.03, that used the bridging structure from the second prototype. Despite being the most modern locomotive of the √ñBB, it wasn't the most reliable. In 1978 wheel cracks occurred, leading to modifications in the wheel design. In the winters from 1979 to 1981, a severe design flaw was noticed, where the air intakes would suck snow particles into the locomotive, damaging its internals. From locomotive 1044.74 onwards, a new intake design was introduced across all new locomotives with the older locomotives being rebuilt using such design. However this performance was mocked by many drivers and railfans, which lead to the locomotive being nicknamed up to this day as a \\"Alpine vacuum cleaner\\". By 1987, 126 of such locomotives were delivered. This was the 1044.0 subseries. Starting from 1989, a second subseries was introduced, the 1044.2 subseries which featured modified bogies, improved sound insulation and different gear ratios. A total of 91 units were made. Out of the 2 prototypes, only 1044.01 survives today. In 1987, it was converted into a high speed test locomotive, being renumbered into 1044.501. During testing, it achieved a maximum speed of 241.25 km/h. After testing its maximum operational speed was reduced to 220 km/h, but in 1996 it suffered drivegear damage, leading to its reconstruction as a normal locomotive and was finally retired in 2002. These days it still exists, however it is in a bad preservation state. 1044.02 was stripped and used as a spare parts locomotive. Between 2002 and 2005, the 1044.2 subseries became the 1144.2 subseries, being retrofitted for usage on push‚Äìpull trains. The 1044.0 subseries was also converted to the 1144 series between 2009 and 2013, being fitted with new GSM-R cab radios, modernized PZB 90 and SIFA safety systems and new LED headlights. The problems with the previous push‚Äìpull control were also fixed, and this refurbishment showed the success of this program that was applied to the older 1042 series that were converted to the 1142 series. The locomotives can be seen on most Austrian mainlines and southern parts of the German railway network. Some locomotives, however, are hired to RCC Germany, a private railway operator, and use them up to Bremerhaven. Before the introduction of the Taurus, these locomotives were used for hauling express trains to Munich. Starting with 2018, the oldest locomotives (manufactured around 1977-1978) have reached their peak kilometrical usage, where they would be retired and used as spares locomotives, however this has yet to have happened to these locomotives, as only one has been withdrawn, expecting scrapping or a life-extending refurbishment. All the locomotives are now painted in the √ñBB red-silver livery, apart from 1144.40 which is painted in the typical √ñBB design used from the 1970s until the 1990s, in the Jaffa orange livery with a white stripe, and the old \\"Pflatsch\\" logo. 1144.092 and 1144.117 feature a so-called \\"Schachbrett\\" introduced in the late 1980s, with a cream and red livery. 1144.092 features the current √ñBB logo, whilst 1144.117 has the \\"Pflatsch\\" logo. Accidents On 13 February 1993, a 1044 241 locomotive was involved in a collision at Melk railway station, severely damaging the locomotive. On 11 August 1995, an intercity from Vienna to Lindau hauled by 1044 047 and with an unknown 1042 locomotive as a bank engine derailed at Braz on the Arlbergbahn when a bridge was washed away by storms. The 1044 locomotive and two passenger cars fell into a small stream and were damaged. Three people were killed after the accident and another 100 were severely injured. The locomotive was so badly damaged in the accident that it was scrapped in the same year. On 12 December 1995, 1044 235 unit was involved in a head-on collision with a DRG Class ET 91 train, commonly known as the \\"Glass Train\\" at Garmisch- Partenkirchen. The accident destroyed the trainset, and despite reconstruction efforts it was rendered unusable due to a heavily damaged bogie (it was the only train of the class that had survived, as the other one was bombed during American air raids during WW2). Another unknown 1044 locomotive was involved in an accident at Vienna-Kledering on 17 November 2001, in which a SPAD was committed by the locomotive. Despite quick braking, the locomotive struck an S-Bahn train that was being diverted onto another track and injured 6 people. On 10 February 2014, two Siemens ES64F4 locomotives of Lokomotion and Rail Traction Company were uncoupled from a Ro-La train that ran away from the Ro- La terminal at Brennero. The train was derailed after it hit a dead end stub track where 1144 281 fell off the embankment, scraping a building in this process. No major damage occurred. The crushed cab of 1144 282 On 1 December 2015, 1144 282 was involved in an accident at Semmering where the locomotive slammed into a heavy freight train that got stuck on the climbing section of the Semmering Railway. The train had stopped there, awaiting for a banking engine to come and help it but accidentally rolled backwards, unknown to the drivers of the 1144. Fourteen container cars derailed, two of them in the tunnel, and the cab of the locomotive was severely damaged, with the train driver being injured.

Mechanics  Powered by the Apocalypse games are centered around resolving what characters do as Moves. Characters have access to a default selection of moves based on the expectations of the game setting. In the fantasy game Dungeon World, characters have access to a hack and slash move, as combat is central to the dungeoneering experience. Alternatively, Apocalypse World has a \\"seize by force\\" move, as the game assumes a setting where collecting scarce resources is part of the game-play experience. Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and most other PbtA games are class-based. Character classes have access to a number of class-specific moves. Moves are resolved by rolling two six-sided dice and adding the relevant modifier, should modifiers be a mechanic in the game.

Life  He attended the gymnasium in Morges, the Free Gymnasium Bern, and passed the matura at another gymnasium in Bern. He studied at the universities of Bern, Strasbourg, and Zurich. The doctorate was awarded to him in 1893 under Heinrich Friedrich Weber in Zurich. From 1893 to 1903 he taught physics and mathematics at the Free Gymnasium Bern. In 1894 he was habilitated in physics and became Privatdozent, and in 1904 titular professor in Bern. From 1906 to 1913 he was professor extraordinarius, and eventually from 1913 to 1939 professor ordinarius for theoretical physics (the first one in Switzerland). From 1921 to 1922 he was rector of this university.Jost, S. 109Mercier, S. 364 In 1892 he became a member of the Society for Natural Sciences of Bern, in 1898 its secretary, from 1904 to 1906 and 1912 to 1914 its vice president and president, and starting in 1939 he held an honorary membership. He was a member of the Swiss Academy of Natural Sciences, being its vice president from 1917 to 1922,Jost, S. 112 and a member of the Swiss Physical Society, being its vice president from 1916 to 1918 and president from 1919 to 1920.Hool & Gra√ühoff, S. 63 He took part in the development of the physics journal Helvetica Physica Acta, was president of the Swiss Meteorological Commission, and due to his Christian faith and rejection of materialism he became a member of the Keplerbund (an association of Christian natural scientists).Mercier, S. 364Bebi√©, S. 230  Scientific work  He published scientific and popular-scientific papers on several topics. Best known was his work on optical depth and twilight phenomena, but he published also in the fields of the theory of relativity and its graphical representation using special Minkowski diagrams, radioactivity, kinetic theory of gases, electron theory, quantum theory, thermodynamics.Jost, S. 111-112Mercier, S. 365-369 (extensive bibliography)  Gruner and Einstein  In 1903, Albert Einstein became a member the Society for Natural Sciences of Bern with the help of one of his colleagues from the patent office in Bern, Josef Sauter. There, Einstein met Sauter's friend Paul Gruner, then Privatdozent for theoretical physics. Einstein held lectures and discussions in Gruner's home and started a letter exchange with him. When Einstein tried to become Privatdozent himself in 1907, Gruner (now professor for theoretical physics in Bern) supported him. Eventually, in 1908 Einstein became Privatdozent in Bern.F√∂lsing, S. 132, 260, 273. Gruner and Sauter were among the participants in the relativity conference held on 11‚Äì16 July 1955 in Bern in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Einstein's 1905 achievement.  Minkowski diagram  Gruner (1921) used symmetric Minkowski diagrams, in which the x'- and ct-axes are mutually perpendicular, as well as the x-axis and the ct'-axis In May 1921, Gruner (in collaboration with Sauter) developed symmetric Minkowski diagrams in two papers, first using the relation \\\\sin\\\\varphi=v/c and in the second one \\\\cos\\\\theta=v/c. (Translation: Elementary geometric representation of the formulas of the special theory of relativity) (Translation: An elementary geometrical representation of the transformation formulas of the special theory of relativity) In subsequent papers in 1922 and 1924 this method was further extended to representations in two- and three- dimensional space. (Translation: Graphical representation of the four- dimensional space-time universe) (See Minkowski diagram#Loedel diagram for mathematical details). Gruner wrote in 1922 that the construction of those diagrams allows for the introduction of a third frame, whose time and space axes are orthogonal as in ordinary Minkowski diagrams. Consequently, it is possible that the coordinates of frames S and S' can be symmetrically projected onto the axes of this frame, making it to some kind of \\"universal frame\\" involving \\"universal coordinates\\" in respect to this system pair. Gruner noted that there is no contradiction to special relativity, since these coordinates are only valid with respect to one system pair only. He acknowledged that he wasn't the first to analyze such \\"universal coordinates\\", and alluded to two predecessors: In 1918 Edouard Guillaume asserted to have found a \\"universal time\\" t in the sense of the Galilei-Newtonian absolute time by analyzing two frames moving in opposite directions, and subsequently claimed to have refuted the principles of relativity. (For an overview on the discussions with the relativity critic Guillaume, see Genovesi (2000)). Guillaume's error was pointed out by Dmitry Mirimanoff in March 1921, showing that Guillaume's variable t in that specific example has a different meaning, and that no contradiction to relativity arises. Time t is rather connected by a constant factor to time \\\\tau of what Mirimanoff called a \\"median frame\\". One always can find a third frame S_0 in which two relatively moving frames S and S' have equal speed in opposite directions. Since the derived coordinates are depending on the relative velocity of the system pair, and consequently are changing for different system pairs, it follows that Guillaume's universal time t derived from \\\\tau, has no \\"universal\\" physical meaning at all. (Translation:The Lorentz-Einstein transformation and the universal time of Ed. Guillaume) Also Gruner came to the same conclusion as Mirimanoff, and gave him credit for the correct interpretation of the meaning of those \\"universal frames\\". While Gruner also gave Guillaume credit for finding certain mathematical relations, he criticized him in several papers for the misapplication of this result and the misguided criticism of relativity.

Formerly known as Christ's Kirk, it was designed by the City of Aberdeen architect John Smith in 1821. Sited on the north edge of the village green, it is within the ancient Udny Parish and the Formartine committee area. It is a Category B listed building. Architecture Constructed from granite in 1821 to the plans of the City of Aberdeen architect, John Smith, this was the first of his ecclesiastical designs to utilise a Tudor-Gothic style. The southern elevation has a four-stage tower with an arched entrance with a hood mould and a curved window above. The tower protrudes from the main rectangular body of the church, which forms symmetrical gables to either side and features elongated arched windows. A broad slated roof tops the main part of the structure and it has pinnacles on the four outside corners. Similar spires are in each corner of the tower above a crenellated parapet. A clock face is set at the top of the south facing side of the tower. It bears a dated stone, 1895, but it is uncertain whether this date applies to the clock itself or if the final stage of the tower was added in that year. The inscribed bell was made by Thomas Mears II. The single- storey harled session house and vestry are sited on the opposite side at the rear elevation of the church. Four plain-glass windows are installed on the west and east elevations. Access is also available on the east side through a side door. In 1890 Alexander Marshall Mackenzie undertook internal restoration work and the roof was replaced. Harrison & Harrison made the pipe organ, which is positioned to the rear of the pulpit. It is of the manual action type. Stained glass panels were placed in the existing three mullioned window on the north gable in 1927. As there is no burial ground attached to the church, burials take place at the nearby Old Church yard instead.

It revolves around the title character Q Pootle 5 and his friends, and is set on and around the fictional planet Oki Doki.  Development  Author and executive producer Nick Butterworth chose Q Pootle 5 from amongst his other children's books as the character to develop into an animated series because, as an alien, he would not be culturally tied to any one location. He developed the series with his son Ben, who suggested they form their own production company. Together with Nick's wife Annette they added additional characters and locations to those already seen in the books, before producing a pilot clip with animation studio Blue-Zoo from which a series was commissioned. Music is an important element of Q Pootle 5. Producer Ben Butterworth says ‚Ä≥When we started to consider the music for the programme we didn‚Äôt want music to be just an accompaniment to the story, we wanted people‚Äôs experience to be enhanced by the music. The score had to be integral to the storytelling ‚Äì creating atmosphere, adding nuance and subtlety, underpinning the emotional content of a story, driving the action of a scene, or making us laugh.‚Ä≥  Characters   Main characters  * Q Pootle 5, known as \\"Pootle\\" to his friends, is a friendly green alien and the lead character in the show. He enjoys stargazing on top of the camper van where he lives and spending time with his friends. * Oopsy is Pootle's best friend. She is pink and has a lot of hair that sticks straight up. Oopsy lives in an upside-down rocket, and enjoys drawing and spending time with Pootle. * Eddi is a two headed purple alien. He talks to himself a lot, and is less confident than the other characters. Eddi enjoys tinkering with his rocket, and adding to his string collection. * Stella is yellow and wears pink wellington boots. She lives in a treehouse and loves gardening most of all, but she also likes to play her bagpipes whenever there's an opportunity to do so. * Ray is a blue major bird. He lives with Stella, and can sometimes be a bit grumpy. He has a fear of heights, and an intense dislike of Stella's bagpipes. * Groobie is the oldest of the gang. He is orange with thick purple eyebrows, and can be a bit forgetful. He lives in a shack in front of a junk yard full of scrap items which he occasionally restores. Everyone likes to gather at Groobie's because he makes the best smoothies in the galaxy. * Bud-D is Groobie's robot. He is enthusiastic and well-intentioned, but often malfunctions. * Planet Dave lives within view of Oki Doki. He is big enough for everyone to land their ships on when they visit him, and is very old indeed.  Additional characters  * Roy is a turquoise major bird, seen in the episode A Friend For Ray. * Maurice is a caterpillar who Stella finds on a plant that Pootle has given her in the episode Maurice. * Planet Roger is not seen in series one, but in the episode Groobie to the Rescue, Groobie reads out a letter sent to Planet Dave from Planet Roger. * Comet Gordon visits Planet Dave once every 3 million years.

There are various buildings in its surrounds, such as the Castell de la Trinitat, as well as the monastery Santa Maria de Roses, the country's earliest known example of the Lombard architectural style. Construction of the present citadel was ordered by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1543 at the same time as Castell de la Trinitat to protect it from pirate attacks and from the French. History The citadel's origins go back to the 4th century BC when Greeks from Massalia created a trading centre which they needed to defend from the Iberians. As it developed over the following century, coins inscribed Œ°ŒüŒîŒóŒ§Œ©Œù were minted with the bust of Arethusa on the front and a rose on the back. After occupying the surrounding area in the early 2nd century during the Punic Wars, the Romans finally sacked the city under the command of Marcus Porcius Cato in the late 3rd century. The Roman colony which was subsequently established lasted almost until the end of the Roman Empire. During the second half of the 1st century AD, Roses was given the status of a town. A temple to Minerva was completed inside the fortifications while a temple to Venus was built in the neighbouring mountains. In the 7th century, the Visigoths built a fort on one of the Puig Rom peaks. It remained in use until the early 8th century. After a short period of occupation by the Arabs, Roses came under the county of Emp√∫ries ruled by the Franks until the abolition of the feudal system in the 9th century. Founded by Benedictine monks in 960, the Monastery of Santa Maria soon became an important abbey with its own fishing rights. The name of Roses was not granted to the settlement until 1362. As Roses gained importance as both a trading centre and a strategic site, it increasingly needed to be defended from attacks by Muslim pirates and by the French who were fighting the Crown of Aragon. After the French had occupied and Roses and burnt it to the ground, Roger of Lauria in command of the Aragonese fleet overcame the French fleet in the bay, liberating the town in 1285. Fortifications were built in 1402 to protect the town from pirate attacks by sea or by overland French invasions. It was with the creation of the Habsburg Empire that the Port of Roses became a vital centre of communications between the Hispanic and Italian sectors of the empire. In 1552, Charles V ordered the Citadel of Roses to be constructed as the centre of defences for the entire Gulf of Roses. As a result of an epidemic in 1588, the monks left their quarters in the Monastery of Roses which in 1592 was attached by papal order to Santa Maria de Amer. In 1792, those still living in the monastery finally abandoned it and the following year it was destroyed by Napoleon's troops.

He was known as a strong supporter of Hugh Capet, who took over as ruler of West Francia. Abbo, who became abbot of Fleury in 988, offended Arnulf by his vigorous advocacy of the rights of monasteries. Their power struggle is documented from Abbo's side in his works. At the Synod of Verzy in 991 Arnulf resisted papal interference, with very aggressive rhetoric. His speech there, O lugenda Roma, was passed down in a text composed by Gerbert d'Aurillac, who became Pope Sylvester II at the end of the decade. Gerbert's version took remarks by Arnulf, and put them into connected form. It also emphasised the attack on the pope of the time, John XV, over the destructive remarks about the institution of the papacy. The business of the meeting, at Saint Basle Monastery, was to deal with Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims as a rebel, part of the aftermath of Hugh Capet's assumption of power from the Carolingians.

The works produced by Hector Hoppin and partner Tony Gross are studied today due to their artistry and as a reflection of the times in which they were created. Biography Hoppin was born March 12, 1906, into a family of wealth & talent. He was the only child of Dorothy Woodville Rockhill and Dr. Joseph Clark Hoppin (1870‚Äì1925), who was a highly regarded archeologist, who taught at Bryn Mawr. His maternal grandfather, William Woodville Rockhill, was a diplomat and considered the first Westerner to gain audience with the Dalai Lama. His paternal grandfather, Dr. Courtland Hoppin (1834‚Äì1876), for whom he was named, was one of twelve children born into a prominent and talented Providence, RI family. He and his brother Washington Hoppin, MD were homeopathic physicians. In 1863 Courtland married Mary Frances Clark (1842‚Äì1934), daughter of Joseph Washington Clark (1810‚Äì1892) and Eleanor Arnold Jackson Clark (1815‚Äì1896). Joseph Clark was a Boston investor, who purchased several hundred acres of land in Pomfret, CT, on the west side of Pomfret Street, in 1888. He built a large summer house there, called \\"La Plaisance,\\" and at the same time, Mary Frances Clark Hoppin, recently widowed, built a house nearby. These two houses still stand, and are included in the Pomfret Street Historic District. They are now both owned by Pomfret School. In about 1892, Mary Frances Clark Hoppin built a much larger house on Deerfield Road, at the southwestern end of her father's property, next to her sister-in-law. She called the house \\"Courtlands.\\" In 1900, after the main building of Pomfret School burned, she gave her first house to the school, and had it moved across the road, to be on the school's property. The house is now called Robinson House, and is the Admissions house for the school. Courtlands still stands, and houses the offices of LIUNA Training & Education Fund. Courtland Hoppin, the younger, was educated at Pomfret School (1923), Harvard University and the University of Cambridge in England, where he obtained his master's degree. He subsequently studied art in Paris and served as Art Director of London Films until the outbreak of World War II. At about this time Courtland adopted the nom de plume of \\"Hector,\\" and was sometimes called \\"Hector Hoppin.\\" Following the war, he studied with psychologist Carl Jung in Switzerland, and worked in the area of clinical psychology in New York City during the 1950s. In 1948, Hector Hoppin published The Psychology of the Artist. He retired to Lido Key in Sarasota, Florida in 1958, where he and his wife Marion were benefactors of New College of Florida, including the endowment of a chair in Asian Studies. Pioneer work in animation While living in Paris in the 1930s, Hoppin collaborated on several animated films with print-maker and painter Anthony Gross, providing his skill as an artist and photographer as well as the capital for the projects. The first animated film of the company they titled \\"HG Productions\\" was Une Journ√©e en Afrique. Completed in 1932, it was followed by Les Fun√©railles and, in 1934, with their most popular and successful work, La Joie de Vivre. Hoppin and Gross hired Hungarian composer Tibor Harsanyi to compose music for the sound track of the film. La Joie de Vivre is described as a break from the \\"limiting comic tradition of the 1930s cartoon animation\\", and its free, decorative style and vague politics permitted its re-release in France during the early 1940s by the Vichy government. The nine-minute film is described in the Internet Movie Database as \\"A tone poem [in which] two woodland sprites dance about, atop power lines and among flowers and leaves, while being pursued. Everyone spends some time pulling levers to switch trains, too.\\" C.H. Hoppin in his Sarasota, Florida, home, December 1961 Following the success of this film, the pair produced works titled The Storm and Fox Hunt. Fox Hunt received praise for its use of color \\"with freedom and beauty quite outside Mr. Disney's picture-book range.\\" In 1938, Hoppin and Gross began their most ambitious work, Around the World in Eighty Days, a color feature based on the Jules Verne novel financed by Alexander Korda of London Films. The project, however, was interrupted by World War II; all traces of the film were thought to have been lost, but in 1956 some negatives were discovered in a projection room at the National Film Theatre in London and efforts were made to piece-together a portion of the original work. The restored section has a running-time of eighteen minutes. :\\"A reel of negatives from the London lab of Technicolor was all that remained. With the assistance of the British Film Institute's Experimental Production Fund, contributing some transitional scenes ‚Äì such as animated diagrams of the voyage through the Suez Canal ‚Äì it was possible to construct a usable, coherent, even vivacious film of great beauty. Hoppin & Gross were innovators. Only the informed eye of a painter could have chosen the colour- palette;the characters are intelligently animated, caricatured with distinction. Of all the film projects that year arising from producers keen to follow the success of Disney's Snow White, Around The World in 80 Days shines like a beacon turned towards the future. Despite some technical weaknesses and its truncated form, the film is a substantial achievement.\\" The New York Public Library has a copy of this film, titled Around the World in Eighteen Minutes, published by McGraw-Hill in 1962. Personal life Hoppin married three times. His first wife, Caroline Benezet Smith Hoppin, died in 1939. She was the mother of their two sons, Nicholas (1936‚Äì1965) and David (1939‚Äì1978). He was divorced from second wife, Peggy Hoppin, and survived by the third, Marion Crosby Hoppin, whom he met while studying psychology with Carl Gustav Jung in Switzerland.

Along with the Ciutadella de Roses, it provided defenses for the town of Roses. The name comes from a chapel built in 1508, which was destroyed, along with a defense tower that stood in the area, when the castle was built, ordered by Emperor Charles V (Carlos I) in 1543. Work began on January 2, 1544 and the castle was completed in mid 1551 under the Spanish engineer Luis Pizano. It was defended for twelve days by Royal Navy sailors and marines under the command of Captain Thomas, Lord Cochrane, supported by Catalan militia and regulars in 1808 and the damage inflicted by the besieging French and Italian artillery was compounded by an immense explosion of gunpowder barrels from Cochrane's frigate , laid by him to deny the investing French control of the sea approaches to the Bay of Rosas. It was built in the shape of a five-pointed star for defence purposes. The construction is about 18‚Äì20 metres high, with thick walls, and designed to house a garrison of about 350 men. The Castell de la Trinitat was declared a Bien de Inter√©s Cultural landmark in 1988. Derelict for nearly 200 years, it underwent restoration amounting to about 2 million euros between 2002 and 2010, and a museum was established at the site.

A member of a noble Venetian family, after his appointment he put the interests of the church ahead of all other concerns. Dandolo supported reform of the clergy along the lines laid down by Bernard of Clairvaux. He was engaged in a long-running dispute over jurisdiction with Giovanni Polani, the Bishop of Castello. He also became involved in a dispute with the doge of Venice over lay involvement in church affairs. The dispute with the doge escalated when the doge supported the Byzantine Empire when it was invaded by the Normans. Venice had critically important economic ties with the empire, but it was in schism with Rome. Dandolo was exiled until the war was over. Later he was restored to authority and gained most of his objectives including recognition of the separation of church from state and of the supremacy of the Patriarchate of Grado over Venice. Early years Enrico Dandolo was the uncle of the famous Doge of Venice, also called Enrico Dandolo. He grew up in the small parish of San Luca, where his contemporary the future doge Pietro Polani also lived. In 1122 the doge Domenico Michiel launched a seaborne crusade to help Baldwin II of Jerusalem. Enrico Dandolo participated in the Venetian Crusade while in his early twenties. The Venetian fleet left on 8 August 1122, and invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. They abandoned the siege when they heard news that King Baldwin II had been taken prisoner, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123. On 15 February 1124 the Venetians began the siege of Tyre, which fell on 7 July 1124. The fleet passed through the Aegean Sea on the return voyage, pillaging Greek islands and forcing the Greeks to abandon the dispute and confirm their privileges. On his return Dandalo embarked on a career as a legal advocate. Patriarch Jurisdictional disputes Church of San Silvestro, Venice, the base of the patriarch on Venice. Dandalo was appointed Patriarch of Grado in 1134, nominated by his boyhood friend the doge Pietro Polani and accepted by the bishops of the lagoon. Dandolo succeeded Giovanni Gradenigo (1105-1131). Dandolo was immediately thrown into the centuries-old dispute over jurisdiction with the Patriarchate of Aquileia. In 1132 Pope Innocent II had restored many of the traditional episcopates to Aquileia, including the Diocese of Istria, reducing Grado to the Venetian Lagoon. Dandalo went to the Council of Pisa in June 1135, as did the reformist Bernard of Clairvaux. The pope confirmed Grado's traditional rights and privileges, but would not restore the lost dioceses. Dandalo became a lifetime supporter of reform and a strong advocate for the freedom and rights of the church. On his return to Venice, Dandalo introduced a chapter of Cistercians to the monastery of San Giorgio di Pineto, the first of their order in the lagoon. Dandalo became involved in a dispute with Giovanni Polani, the Bishop of Castello. One of the sources of tension was that by this time the patriarchs of Grado spent little time in Grado itself, but made their base the church of San Silvestro in Venice, within the jurisdiction of the diocese of Castello. In 1139, encouraged by Dandolo, the clergy of the ancient church of San Salvatore in central Venice decided to become canons regular under the rule of St. Augustine. The diocese had less control over such semi-monastic communities, some of which were directly linked to Rome. The clergy failed to confirm their subordination to the diocese. Polani was furious at what he saw as an attempt to take this important parish away from his control, and placed it under interdict. In response, Dandolo placed it under his metropolitan protection. On 13 May 1141 Pope Innocent II lifted the interdict, placed San Salvatore under his personal protection and sent two canons to instruct the congregation in the rule. In 1141 Dandolo placed and blessed the foundation stone of the complex holding a church and hostel for pilgrims on the Isola di San Clemente. The island was given to canons regular. Dandolo expected it would come under the patriarchate of Grado, and this became a long-running cause of dispute with Polani. In August 1143 the cardinal-priest Goizo of Santa Cecilia visited Venice, and following this visit Pope Lucius II (1144‚Äì45) published clear definitions of the jurisdictions of Castello and Grado. Sometime between 1141 and 1145 the doge nominated a new abbess for the convent of San Zaccaria to replace Nella Michiel, who had died. Dandolo condemned this lay interference in election of the abbess, and disputed the doge's right to invest her. A new abbess was only confirmed in 1151, and was not a member of a leading Venetian family. It is not clear whether this was a victory for Dandalo, but certainly he had alienated the doge as well as the bishop. Norman war In 1147 a Norman fleet captured the island of Corfu from the Byzantines, then began to attack and loot the coastal towns of Greece, facing little serious resistance. In October 1147 the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus (1143‚Äì80) sent an urgent request for help to Venice. The Doge Pietro Polani called for all Venetians to help prepare a fleet to attack the Normans in the spring. The trade with Byzantium was crucial to the Venetian economy, and Corfu also commanded the trade route to the east, but Dandalo opposed coming to the aid of the Greeks on the grounds that they were schismatic. Dandalo went against his family interests in this, and also took a position that the Pope could not support. The papacy was in a state of war with the Normans, although temporarily at truce, and the Byzantine emperor was providing valuable support for the Second Crusade. This dispute culminated in the exile of the patriarch. In 1147 the doge had Dandolo expelled from Venice. All the houses of the Dandolo family were levelled. Dandolo fled to Rome, where Pope Eugene III (1145-1153) excommunicated the doge and placed an interdict on the whole city of Venice. The doge went ahead with a successful expedition against the Normans, in which he died. Later years The new doge Domenico Morosini (1148‚Äì55) rescinded the exile and ordered reconstruction of the Dandolo family compound at the expense of the state. In late 1149 Morosini agreed that the lay rulers of Venice would not interfere with church affairs. On the other hand, prelates would no longer be involved in secular affairs. Dandalo returned to Venice in 1150 or 1151. In January 1153 Dandolo held a provincial synod in Venice to discuss a dispute between two parishes in the diocese of Murano. This choice of location was an assertion of authority over Castillo. In 1155 Dandolo was consecrated by Pope Hadrian IV (1154‚Äì59) as Primate of Dalmatia, with authority over the archdiocese of Zara. In October 1156 Bishop Polani was forced by the Pope to relinquish all claims against the church of San Clemente. In June 1157 Dandolo gained the authority to ordain Latin bishops in any Byzantine cities where Venice had churches, including Constantinople. The pope made it clear to the Venetians that Dandolo should be respected as their spiritual father. In 1162, while Venice was involved in a war with Padua and Ferrara, the Patriarch Ulrich II of Aquileia attacked Grado. Dandolo was forced to flee to Venice. The doge Vitale II Michiel responded forcibly. He captured Ulrich and destroyed several of his castles in Friuli. Eventually Pope Alexander III intervened to make a peace. The doge's captives were released in exchange for payment of an annual tribute of a bull, twelve pigs and 300 loaves of bread. The animals would be slaughtered in a public ceremony to commemorate the victory. Around 1170 Dandolo appointed Romano Mairano his agent for collecting revenues from the patriarchal properties in Constantinople in return for an annual payment of fifty pounds of Venetian pennies. This contract proved impossible to fulfil, since tensions and rivalries between the Greeks and Venetians in Constantinople led to the imperial government imprisoning the Venetians and seizing their assets in 1171. The patriarch had an aula in Venice in 1153, and in 1164 there are mentions of a palacium beside San Silvestro. Pope Alexander III lodged in the palacium when he visited Venice in 1177. The church of San Silvestro was given the title to the ground floor of the palacium in 1182. At this time it was a substantial building, at least two stories high. It included a large hall and had a private chapel on the first floor. Dandolo suggested merging the patriarchate of Grado and the episcopal see of Castello to Pope Alexander III, perhaps as early as 1177. In March 1179 Dandolo attended the Third Council of the Lateran in Rome. On 24 July 1180 he agreed to a final and formal resolution of the ancient disputes with the patriarchate of Aquileia. In the presence of Alexander III and Ulrich II of Aquileia he renounced his claims to the disputed dioceses in Istria and to the relics and treasures that Poppo of Aquileia had taken from Grado at the start of the 11th century. Dandolo died in 1182 and was succeeded by Giovanni Segnale, who was confirmed by Pope Clement III.

The company was created in France by Philippe Guign√©, CEO of ManyPlayers, for the 2006 edition of the Route du Rhum, with Virtual Regatta Offshore established as a real-time yacht routing game. Since then, the company has been working with the media departments of major oceanic races and their sponsors. In 2015, the company developed Virtual Regatta Inshore, a fleet racing game (similar to that of car racing games), in partnership with World Sailing. This led to the first eSailing World Championship in 2018. Virtual Regatta Offshore  Game play  Virtual Regatta Offshore - User Interface in 2016 3D Race Reviewer Virtual RegattaOffshore organizes approximately 15 races a year. Some of these are held in partnership with some of the world's most famous sailing races, including the Vend√©e Globe, Route du Rhum, Volvo Ocean Race and the Solitaire du Figaro. These virtual regattas have routes identical to that of the actual race and the same start times. For each race, Virtual Regatta simulates the real meteorological conditions experienced by the skippers and allows its players to participate in real-time from their computers or mobile devices. Players have to take into account real-time meteorological conditions in order to choose the best sail settings and heading, as they race against one another around the course. After signing up for a race, players can also choose their preferred type of boat and personalize it. Some races offer prize money of up to thousands of euros, which is split among the winners. Significant Races The first edition of the game had approximately 50,000 players. The game's popularity spiked during the Vend√©e Globe 2008-2009, which saw 340,000 virtual sailors participate. The winner, Hugues Fournier, took 85 days, 19 hours and 45 minutes to sail around the world, which was only 36 hours more than the real winner of the race, Michel Desjoyeaux. Following this success, as well as that of the Volvo Ocean Race 2009-2010, the French Sailing Federation granted Virtual Regatta the status of a nautical club, where one can obtain a sailing license, in 2011. The game inspired the 200-page novel Sur la vague virtuelle du vend√©e, written by author Patrice Baluc-Rittener and published in 2008. The story is a autobiographical recount of the author's personal adventure on board his virtual boat, ‚ÄúMacAII‚Äù on Virtual Regatta during the 2008-09 Vend√©e Globe. ‚ÄúMacAII‚Äù finished the race in 88 days, 11 hours and 15 minutes. In 2010, the site had 600,000 registered players. There was an average of 35,000 players participating in each race, though races like the Vend√©e Globe and Volvo Ocean race saw more players. 245,000 players competed in the Route du Rhum 2010, which was won by \\"Bolki\\". Virtual Regatta organized challenges with famous skippers Lo√Øc Peyron in 2009, Samantha Davies in 2010 and Roland Jourdain in 2011, with the 3 skippers participating in the virtual race alongside the other players.

Her husband was its third emperor Li Conghou (Emperor Min).  Background  It is not known when the future Empress Kong was born. Her father was Kong Xun, who had served as an official of Later Tang's predecessor (and rival) Later Liang prior to serving Later Tang.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 43. By 928, Kong Xun was serving as a chief of staff for Later Tang's second emperor Li Siyuan, and he was a close associate of fellow chief of staff An Chonghui, who was then the most powerful figure at court. At one point, Li Siyuan had wanted to take An's daughter as wife for one of his sons. Kong dissuaded An, arguing that given how honored and how close to the emperor he was, it was inappropriate to further create a marital relationship, so An declined. However, thereafter, there were those who told An that Kong was good at alienating people. When Kong heard this, apparently wanting to create a relationship with the imperial household independent of his relationship with An, he ingratiated Li Siyuan's favorite concubine Consort Wang and sought that his daughter be married to an imperial prince. Consort Wang thus suggested to Li Siyuan that Kong's daughter be married to his son Li Conghou. Li Siyuan agreed. When An heard this, he became incensed, and he had Kong ejected from the court (then at Daliang) to serve as the defender of Luoyang. However, this did not stop the marriage, and the wedding took place around the new year 929. It was because of the wedding's taking place that Kong was able to go to Daliang to attend the wedding. Once at Daliang, he again tried to ingratiate Consort Wang and her associates, hoping to stay at Daliang. Due to An's stern opposition, however, he was returned to Luoyang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. Princess Kong was said to be wise in her actions, and she bore four sons for Li Conghou.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 15.  As empress  Li Siyuan died in late 933, and Li Conghou became emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. According to the New History of the Five Dynasties, he created Princess Kong empress, but a formal creation ceremony was not held at that time. At that time, the court scene was controlled by Li Conghou's chiefs of staff Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun. They suspected the powers held by Li Conghou's older adoptive brother Li Congke the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and brother-in-law Shi Jingtang the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li Congke's oldest son Li Chongji (ÊùéÈáçÂêâ) was then a commander of the imperial guards, and they did not want him to hold such a command. They therefore sent him out of the capital to serve as military prefect of Bo Prefecture (‰∫≥Â∑û, in modern Bozhou, Anhui). In addition, they forced Li Congke's daughter Li Huiming (ÊùéÊÉ†Êòé), who had become a Buddhist nun at then-capital Luoyang, to live in the palace, believing that this would give them greater control on her father. As a result, Li Congke became fearful. In spring 934, not wanting Shi to remain at Hedong for long, Zhu and Feng transferred Shi, Li Congke, and Fan Yanguang the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) to new assignments. Believing that this was intended to target him, Li Congke rebelled. During his rebellion, Li Chongji and Li Huiming were executed. Li Congke's rebellion was successful, and he quickly reached Luoyang's vicinity. Li Conghou fled, hoping to gain Shi's support, but was soon put under effective house arrest by Shi, who pledged allegiance to Li Congke.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. At that time, Empress Kong was ill, and her children were young, and therefore none of them was able to accompany him. Li Congke thereafter took the throne, and had Li Conghou killed. After that, Li Congke sent a messenger to Empress Kong, stating, \\"Now, where is Li Chongji?\\" He then put her and her sons to death. After Shi subsequently overthrew Li Congke in 936 and established his own Later Jin, he posthumously gave Empress Kong her posthumous name of Ai (\\"lamentable\\").

Coming to power  Not much is known about his childhood. He fled to Nowshahr after his grandfather Gazi Beg's disastrous defeat. Having heard news that the Safavid ruler Ismail I was coming after him, he fled to Gilan, where he hid for two years. In 1502, a rebellion erupted in Shirvan and his nephew Sultan Mahmud was deposed. Local people invited Ibrahim to the throne of Shirvan same year.  Reign  In his 3rd year of rule, Shah Ismail I besieged Gulustan castle in order to restore Mahmud who fled to his court after deposition. After three months of siege, unexpectedly, a slave of Mahmud beheaded him at night and sent his head to Ibrahim. Sheykhshah, excited by the news, suddenly made a raid on besieging Safavid forces and forced them to flee.

It served Pittsburg, Kansas area. The station was owned by American Media Investments, and was branded as B100.7 until May 2008. In February 2009, KBZI was set to make a move to 107.1 FM so that its signal would better serve the southern part of the Pittsburg market and the nearby Joplin, Missouri market. However, this severely weakened its signal in the northern part of the market, 100.7's primary coverage area, making it more difficult to pick it up in Fort Scott and Nevada, where it had a significant following. The switch was delayed due to high winds, which prevented workers from installing the transmitter on its new tower, which kept the station off the air for three days. A few days later, it was rumored that the 107.1 BZI experiment had already been killed and the 107.1 frequency was restored to the format it had been carrying before the switch. The frequency went dark after that, and later was vacated. The license was purchased Patrick Parker and MyTown Media, LCC, took over operations.

The film is directed by Nick Riedell and Chris Riedell, also known as The Brothers Riedell, and produced by Michael Goldfine. The film, produced by RockStream Studios, was released on February 14, 2014. Plot Elise Miller (Grace Helbig) is a twenty-something publishing assistant who is engaged to Jeff Sanford (Chester See), and just finished her first book, which is said to include \\"unrequited love and the Loch Ness Monster.\\" At work, Elise accidentally sees her boss, Celia Burrows (Rachel Quaintance), making out with Walker Paige (Sawyer Hartman), of the hit \\"Midnight Moonlight\\" series. Her friend Manda (Megan M. Duffy) takes some photos of the two, which Elise accidentally uploads to the book's Facebook page; this blunder costs Elise her job. She returns home, only to find out that Jeff has been cheating on her, so she returns to her old apartment. She gets drunk, and calls Sally Meister (Ellen Karsten), the head camp counselor of Elise's old camp, Camp Takota, whom she met earlier again after eight years, and tells her that she's going back to camp. The next morning, Elise wakes up realizes what she has done, and decides to head to camp anyway. Arriving with the Fefferman family, including their young daughter Penny, Elise finds that her old friends and former Takota campers, Maxine Reynolds (Mamrie Hart) and Allison Henry (Hannah Hart), now work at the camp. As the newest camp counselor, Elise has her hands full handling the campers, as she isn‚Äôt interested in the whole camp experience. When she snaps on the campers in her class, after they find the letters Jeff has been sending her to win her back, Maxine invites her to her home with Allison later that night. Elise reveals what's been going on, with work, her ex-fianc√©e, and wishes that she was more like \\"a happier version of herself\\". As the three party, Elise spots Allison's acceptance letter from the Chicago Chef's Institute, then is startled by the appearance of Eli (Chris Riedell), the two girls' friend who works as a farmer. Giving her a lift back to camp, she finds that Eli had an ex-wife who cheated on him, and an attraction builds. The camp is visited by Jared Meister (John Milhiser), Sally's son, and his assistant Kyle (Jason McNichols), who want to turn Camp Takota into a more digital camp, because Takota has been losing business. Maxine soon gets confirmation from Sally that the camp will be closing after this summer, unless at least 50% of the campers pre-register for next year. She tells the news to Allison, Elise, and Chet (Cameron Britton), the camp's handyman, and they all agree to try to save the camp. However, Elise gets a call from Celia, who offers her her job back because the photos that were uploaded gave the \\"Midnight Moonlight\\" sales a huge boost, and agrees to publish her book if she arrives tomorrow morning. Elise takes up the offer, telling Maxine and Allison the news, which gets them into a heated argument because Maxine knows this isn't what Elise wants. Elise ends up revealing that Maxine is only saving the camp so she can get her promotion, and Allison got a career offer, and doesn't want Maxine to know because she is a control freak. Elise asks Eli for a ride to the train station, but he refuses because she's not just leaving Takota, she‚Äôs also leaving him, so she asks Chet for a ride. Allison talks to Maxine, revealing that she wanted to leave but was afraid of her reaction, but Maxine confesses that all she wants is for Allison to go and be happy. Elise sits at the bus station, and thinks about the camp and her friends, and soon returns. At the camp's final day, which is also Visitor's Day for parents; Elise, Maxine, and Allison put on a dance number. Later that night, Jared reveals the plan to replace Camp Takota, to which Maxine gives a tearful explanation over why they shouldn't allow that to happen. She then introduces Eli to the campers, who is also revealed to be a writer just like Elise, and tells a ghost story to them. Suddenly, Jeff interrupts and demands Elise to come home with him, but she refuses, with Jeff fighting Eli when she reveals he is her boyfriend. Jeff leaves in shame, and the night's events lead to 60% of the campers to pre- register for the next summer the next day, thus saving the camp. With the mission a success, the three girls sit and look out in the sunset before leaving. One year later, Maxine is the new head camp counselor at Takota; Allison is now in a culinary school training to be a chef in Chicago, and Elise and Eli are together, with Elise finally achieving success with her new book, \\"Cabin Fever\\", all about Camp Takota, featuring a character resembling Penny.

Hill's Student Songs. The song was the college anthem of Trinity University College. It was famously performed by Rudy Vall√©e as \\"The Drunkard Song\\", slightly changing the chorus. While recording the last verses of the song, Vall√©e started to laugh uncontrollably given the corny lyrics. He and his band recorded the song again without laughing, but Victor released both takes in 1934. He also performs the song in the film Sweet Music. There have also been recordings by Gracie Fields (c.1938) and Wally Cox. Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961) and Nat King Cole performed a cover of the song on his album Those Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer (1963). While the song is usually performed up-tempo, a balladic version appeared in the Ripper Street third season episode \\"Ashes and Diamonds\\", arranged for Charlene McKenna as the character Rose Erskine on BBC One and Amazon Prime Instant Video. Lyrics There is a tavern in the town, in the town And there my true love sits him down, sits him down, And drinks his wine as merry as can be, And never, never thinks of me. Chorus: Fare thee well, for I must leave thee, Do not let this parting grieve thee, And remember that the best of friends Must part, must part. Adieu, adieu kind friends, adieu, adieu, adieu, I can no longer stay with you, stay with you, I will hang my harp on the weeping willow tree, And may the world go well with thee. He left me for a damsel dark, damsel dark, Each Friday night they used to spark, used to spark, And now my love who once was true to me Takes this dark damsel on his knee. And now I see him nevermore, nevermore; He never knocks upon my door, on my door; Oh, woe is me; he pinned a little note, And these were all the words he wrote: Oh, dig my grave both wide and deep, wide and deep; Put tombstones at my head and feet, head and feet And on my breast you may carve a turtle dove, To signify I died of love.

Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, itself a separate public holiday. The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country. One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center. Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992. History In the event known by the critics as the \\"Miracle of the Vistula,\\" the Polish Army under the command of Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski successfully repulsed a Red Army offensive outside of Warsaw in mid-August 1920. The defeat of the Russian army ensured the capital's protection and the survival of the young Second Polish Republic. To commemorate the republic's victory over the Red Army, Minister of Military Affairs Stanis≈Çaw Szeptycki established the Feast of the Soldier (≈öwiƒôta ≈ªo≈Çnierza), or Soldiers Day, in 1923. In proclaiming the holiday, Szeptycki declared that, \\"[o]n the anniversary of the memorable defeat of the Bolshevik onslaught on Warsaw, we honor the memory of those killed in battles with enemies throughout all ages and for Polish independence.\\" The date of 15 August was chosen as it coincided with the 21st Mountain Division's evening counterattack on Russian troops, eventually forcing the Red Army's general retreat. Additionally, the government of the Second Republic desired the military's greater integration with the new state, as well as for the armed forces to improve its image among the civilian public. The Feast of the Soldier remained a celebrated holiday until 1947, when the newly installed communist government of the People's Republic of Poland discontinued the tradition. In 1950, the Council of Ministers under Prime Minister J√≥zef Cyrankiewicz passed regulations to officially celebrate the military on 12 October. Renaming the celebration as Polish Armed Forces Day (Dzie≈Ñ Wojska Polskiego), the day marked the anniversary of the Soviet- organized Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division engaging German units at the Battle of Lenino in October 1943. The communist government found it impossible to celebrate the original date of 15 August and its coinciding historical significance, owing to its glorification of the Red Army's defeat. Following the return of democracy in the wake of the events of 1989, the Sejm approved the restoration of Armed Forces Day to the original 15 August date and meaning on 30 July 1992, repealing the earlier communist era 1950 declaration. Commemorations Armed Forces Day is celebrated throughout Poland, with military parades, commemorations for active personnel, veterans, and the dead. As the day coincides with the religious Day of the Assumption, church masses across the country reflect on the memory of Poland's military dead. Additionally, a number of military-themed events are held throughout many of the nation's larger towns and cities, including equipment demonstrations for the general public and open house events. In Warsaw, the holiday is commemorated by several state events in the central ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie borough of the capital. As head of state and commander-in-chief, the President of Poland presides over promotions of high-ranking officers, including the promotion of colonels to generals at the Presidential Palace. The pageantry continues with commemorations near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier held in Pi≈Çsudski Square. The events in Warsaw typically involve the participation of the nation's political establishment, including the president, the prime minister, and leading members of the cabinet. Leading politicians also lay wreaths at the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Monument, as well as at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. As a NATO member state, Armed Forces Day in Poland typically draws representatives from other allied militaries in attendance.. At 12:00 noon, representatives of the Lithuanian, American, German and Latvian armies can be seen in attendance. The centennial celebrations for 2020 were \\"1920 Battle of Warsaw - a Polish victory for the freedom of Europe\\".https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/military-parade-to-be- centrepiece-of-battle-of-warsaw-anniversary---mod-14436 Armed Forces Day Parade One of the main attractions of the Warsaw festivities is a military parade of servicemen and women, as well as a review of existing military equipment, held normally along Ujazd√≥w Avenue.

While ampelographers believe that the name Trevisana suggest that the grape originated in the province of Treviso, today the grape is almost exclusively found in the northern province of Belluno, particularly around the commune of Feltre, where the grape is a permitted variety in the Indicazione geografica tipica (IGT) zone of Vigneti delle Dolomiti.J.

Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 1084-1085 Allen Lane 2012 History The Belluno province in the Veneto region where Trevisana nera is grown. The history of Trevisana nera is relatively recent with the grape's first documented appearance in viticultural documents dating to mid-20th century. While the grape has almost exclusively been found in the province of Belluno, ampelographers believe that the name Trevisana suggest an origin in the more southern Venetian province of Treviso though DNA profiling has so far not shown any relationship between Trevisana and any other grapes from Treviso. From 2003 to 2008, DNA analysis showed that the Gattera and Borgogna grapes from the commune of Castelcucco in the province of Treviso and the Refosco di Guarnieri grape from the Friuli-Venezia Giulia wine region were identical to Trevisana nera. Viticulture Trevisana nera is mid to late ripening grapevine that can be very vigorous and high yielding if not kept in check by winter pruning and later leaf pulling and green harvesting during the growing season. Wine regions While Trevisana nera can be used for wine grape production, in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia it is often used as a table or eating grape. In 2000, there were of Trevisana nera planted almost exclusively around the commune of Feltre in the province of Belluno, located between the province of Udine to the east in the Friuli- Venezia Giulia and the province of Trentino in the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol to the northwest. Outside of Feltre, there are some limited plantings of the grape around the commune of Castelcucco in Treviso where the grape is known as Borgogna and Gattera and in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia where the grape is known as Refosco di Guarnieri and is mainly used as a table grape variety.

Plot  Santiago is a young engineer who owns a prosperous company as a real estate developer. With a wife who loves him and a baby boy, Santiago enjoys a comfortable life between an apartment in Medellin and a large recreational farmhouse in the country side. In 1984, cocaine trafficking is rampant and many of those who buy the properties built by Santiago are drug dealers laundering money. Facing a shortage of cash need it to end his latest building project, Santiago asks for a loan form his father, owner of a transport company, but his old man can't provide any economical help then. During a party with friends at his farmhouse Santiago is lured to get the money he needs from one of his friends who is a wealthy drug dealer. Although entice to the heavy partying, money and drugs that comes with the business, Santiago is initially reluctant to get involve dealing with drugs. One of Santiago's business partners, nicknamed 'el duende' (the goblin), introduces Santiago to Gerardo, a humble, but increasingly wealthy man whose front business is a mechanic's shop and son of one of the former employees of his father. In reality, Gerardo is making a fortune with a secret laboratory preparing cocaine's paste. Gerardo has many contacts in the rural region of Frontino, Antioquia were the authorities turn a blind eye to his rustic laboratory to process cocaine. Gerardo takes Santiago to his laboratory and makes him business partner. He not only can use Santiago's trucks to transport the chemicals needed to process cocaine, but wants to sell the drug to Santiago's drug-dealers friends who transport the drug to the United States. Lured to the temptation of easy money and heavy partying, Santiago gets increasingly involved in cocaine tracking. Gerardo, a man with no education and of cultural background with little in common with Santiago is nevertheless charismatic and offers him a warm friendship, money, decadent parties, easy women, alcohol and drugs. However, all this weakens the relationship between Santiago and his family Santiago involvement in drug-trafficking increases. One of his contacts, a powerful drug dealer, nicknamed 'El Primo', buys the cocaine produced by Gerardo to send it to the US in a deal in which Santiago has heavily invested. The transaction fails miserably. Once in the USA the cocaine is revealed to be of very low quality. Santiago is made responsible for the failure by both parties, el primo and Gerardo, who also blame each other. Gerardo also experiences a personal tragedy. He always had a soft spot for his younger brother, Alberto nicknamed 'Petroleum', an aimless young man and drug addict. While buying milk with his wife for their baby, he has an argument with some neighborhood hitmen who follow Alberto and kill him while he tries to change a flat tire. Santiago's wife, Paula, worries about her husband with his frequent absences from home and incremental alcohol and drug use. Paula confronts Santiago and he promises her to put his act together and put an end to his dark dealings. This makes Santiago avoid going to Alberto's funeral which Gerardo resents. As he faces increasingly pressure from Gerardo, who has lost his drug laboratory, Santiago tries to get to an agreement with the drug dealers since the drug shipment had arrived in poor condition to United States for its low purity, but he is kidnapped and he is only released when his family pays a big ransom for his freedom. Free, but with his own personal fortune lost, Santiago, in secret compliance with El primo, visits Gerardo for a last time. Santiago asks Gerardo for money still owed to him and for the truck he loaned him. They meet at a restaurant. Gerardo abruptly dismisses Santiago's claims. As Santiago leaves the restaurant humiliated by Gerardo's diatribe, Gerardo is killed inside the restaurant by hit men hired by el primo.

Vanderpool's work is unusual in that he combines his medical training with an explicit effort to convert his patients to Christianity. Early life and education Vanderpool was born in Dallas, Texas, graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas, and received his undergraduate degree from Abilene Christian University in 1982. He then attended the School of Medicine at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center. After medical school, Vanderpool completed two surgical residencies at Baylor University Medical Center where he trained as a vascular surgeon. Family Vanderpool wife, Laurie, is a speaker for Women's Retreats and Bible Studies, and speaks frequently for Down Syndrome organizations. Early career Vanderpool remained in Texas after residency and practiced as a vascular surgeon before moving to Brentwood, Tennessee in 2001 and opening his private practice Lave MD in 2003. Dr. Vanderpool created Lave MD to act as both a medical facility and a spa. After the establishment of his international organization in 2005, Dr. Vanderpool used much of Lave MD's proceeds to fund the organization's efforts abroad. Medical missionary work In 2005, after Hurricane Katrina hit the southeastern part of the United States, Dr. Vanderpool delivered healthcare across the Mississippi Coast out of a trailer. His goal was to provide as much free healthcare as possible while the medical infrastructure could recover. Months later, Dr. Vanderpool established his organization, Medical Mobile Disaster Relief, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization with goals to provide disaster relief through medical clinics, clean water projects, and micro-finance projects to areas hit by disasters. Vanderpool and the Mobile Medical Disaster Relief team began working in Mozambique in 2006. His goal was to provide healthcare to the indigenous people of the country in addition to enhancing the economy by implementing micro-finance projects among widows living in the communities. By 2008, Dr. Vanderpool teamed up with the Belmont School of Nursing to construct a nursing curriculum that could teach the Mozambique women to be self- sufficient in caring for themselves and their children. Vanderpool and his Mobile Medical Disaster Relief partnered with PACODEP (Partners in Community Development) in Ghana in order to provide medical care, educate the locals on water purification and distribute water purifiers. PACODEP works to free enslaved children who are trafficked through Ghana for purposes of fishing work. Dr. Vanderpool has also partnered with local hospitals in Ghana in order to provide free invasive surgeries to these rescued children. Dr. Vanderpool partnered with Mission Lazarus in 2009 to build a sustainable medical clinic in Cede√±o, Honduras. Given sufficient medical supplies and equipment, Vanderpool allowed Mission Lazarus to take over the clinic and provision of healthcare for the people of Cede√±o. Live Beyond in Haiti Dr. Vanderpool shifted his focus in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated the entire country of Haiti in 2010. In 2010, Vanderpool officially changed the name of his organization from Mobile Medical Disaster Relief to Live Beyond with a stated mission to be \\"an organization that chooses to Live Beyond...ourselves, our culture, our borders and this life so that others can Live Beyond‚Ä¶disease, hunger, poverty and despair.\\" The initial aid Vanderpool and his team brought to Haiti was primarily mobile medical care to relieve the thousands devastated and injured by the earthquake. Since then however, Vanderpool has grounded his missionary work in Thomazeau, Haiti where his organization began building a base. Vanderpool continued to provide free medical care, establishing a surgical hospital and clinic. In addition, clean water projects, orphanages, and other widow and orphan advocacy projects were begun. Religion Dr. Vanderpool is a Christian, who combines religion and the spread of his faith with his medical work. In Haiti, he has made it one of his objectives to bring Haiti away from its traditional voodoo culture and provide \\"spiritual guidance\\" to the Haitians in the role of Christianity, with the belief that Christianity will lead to a better Haiti. Prior to moving to Haiti, each medical outreach trip made by Vanderpool and other Live Beyond participants included prayer and Christian ministry along with healthcare to the voodoo priests, island chiefs, idol worshipers and the sick and dying in Haiti. On the Live Beyond site, Vanderpool's religious impact since being in Haiti has been characterized as leading to the baptism of dozens, the saving of tribes through \\"Bibles being read in their own languages\\" and \\"the Kingdom is being expanded.\\" Dr. Vanderpool promotes religious missionary work in tandem with his medical relief and sustainable development efforts. A worship center is being built in Thomazeau, Haiti and monthly mission trips are promoted and scheduled for Americans to travel to Thomazeau and volunteer.

The series is produced by Friedrich and Elsje Stark of Stark Productions. Binnelanders is currently airing season 9. Production history Binnelanders began as a weekly one-hour drama, the first episode of which was broadcast only in Afrikaans on 13 October 2005 on both M-Net and kykNET. Halfway through the show's second season, it became a daily half-hour soap opera, and English subtitles were introduced. It was broadcast directly after Egoli on M-Net in the 18:30 time slot. Programming shifted to the 18:00 timeslot in preparation for the conclusion of Egoli, after which Binnelanders would extend over a one- hour period, consuming both time slots. The title of the show was changed to Binneland Sub Judice, and a new legal firm, Rossouw, Paulse and Knight Incorporated (RPK), was added to the storyline, along with new characters. For the seventh season, the show was again renamed, this time to simply Binneland. The legal angle of the series was dropped, and the show was reverted to a half-hour time slot. Binneland was removed from M-Net in early 2011 and the name was changed back to Binnelanders and is now broadcast exclusively on kykNET, weekdays 19:30. Opening sequence The theme song used in Binnelanders was written and performed by Afrikaans artist Jak de Priester.

June 23, 947Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 287.Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), known commonly by her imperial consort title Shufei (ÁéãÊ∑ëÂ¶É), nickname Huajianxiu (Ëä±Ë¶ãÁæû, \\"flowers would be ashamed to see her\\"), was an noble consort to Li Siyuan (Emperor Mingzong), the second emperor of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Later Tang. During Li Siyuan's reign, she, as his favorite concubine, exerted substantial influence within his administration. After the destruction of both Later Tang and its successor state Later Jin (by the Khitan Liao Dynasty), her adoptive son Li Congyi was forced to claim imperial title by the evacuating Liao forces, and both she and he were subsequently killed by the succeeding Later Han's founding emperor Liu Zhiyuan.  Background  It is not known when Lady Wang was born. She was a daughter in a household from Bin Prefecture (ÈÇ†Â∑û, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) that made cakes. Because of her great beauty, she gained the nickname of \\"Huajianxiu\\" (Ëä±Ë¶ãÁæû, \\"flowers would be ashamed to see her\\"). She was, in her youth, sold as a servant girl to the Later Liang general Liu Xun. Liu apparently favored her greatly, as he gave her a large amount of money.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 15. After Liu's death in 921,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. she did not marry, and was apparently living off savings that Liu left her.  During Later Tang   During Li Cunxu's reign  Sometime during the reign of Li Cunxu, the founding emperor of Later Liang's successor state Later Tang, Li Cunxu's adoptive brother and major general Li Siyuan was looking for an additional concubine after his concubine or co-wife Lady Xia died. Someone informed Li Siyuan's close associate An Chonghui about Lady Wang, and An in turn suggested Li Siyuan to take her as a concubine, and Li Siyuan did. As she still had a large amount of money left from what Liu Xun left her, she awarded much of it to Li Siyuan's associates and daughters-in- law, such that throughout the household, everyone praised her. Li Siyuan's wife Lady Cao favored the simple life and did not contend for his favor, and therefore Lady Wang became his favorite.  During Li Siyuan's reign  Li Cunxu was killed in a mutiny at the capital Luoyang in 926. Li Siyuan subsequently claimed imperial title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 275. In 928, he created Lady Cao, who was then carrying the title of Lady of Chu, the imperial consort title of Shufei (), and created Lady Wang, who was then carrying the title of Lady of Han, the lesser (although still high-ranked) title of Defei ().History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 39. She was apparently childless, and Li Siyuan had her raise his youngest son Li Congyi (later created the Prince of Xu) and a daughter (later created Princess Yong'an) as their mother. By 928, Consort Wang was apparently already sufficiently powerful inside the palace that, when Li Siyuan's chief of staff Kong Xun wanted to have his daughter married to one of the emperor's sons, it was Consort Wang that he ingratiated. She subsequently suggested to Li Siyuan that his son (by the deceased Lady Xia) Li Conghou marry Kong's daughter, and Li Siyuan agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 276. In 930, Li Siyuan was prepared to create Consort Cao empress. She stated to Consort Wang, \\"I have always despised minute matters, and I do not want to be involved in ceremonies. You, sister, should substitute for me.\\" Consort Wang responded, \\"The Central Palace [(i.e., the empress's palace, and therefore an alternate way to refer to the empress)] matches the Supreme One [(i.e., the emperor)]. Who would dare to step in?\\" Li Siyuan subsequently created Consort Cao empress, and later promoted Consort Wang to the rank of Shufei.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Consort Wang served both Li Siyuan and Empress Cao carefully, such that Empress Cao and Consort Wang became very close. However, it was said that because of this, Consort Wang effectively controlled what occurred in the palace. She lived luxuriously (by that period's standard), using silk to make her skirts. An Chonghui tried to curb her luxurious living by comparing her lifestyle to the terrible fate that Li Cunxu's wife Empress Liu suffered. She thereafter began to dislike An. Both she and the eunuch Meng Hanqiong were therefore repeatedly speaking against An. Later in 930, there was a time when An wanted to try to harm Li Siyuan's adoptive son Li Congke, who was then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), against whom he had a previous grudge. He thus induced Li Congke's officer Yang Yanwen () into a mutiny against Li Congke, and subsequently tried to use the mutiny to get Li Siyuan to kill or otherwise severely punish Li Congke. It was said that it was due to Consort Wang's speaking on his behalf that Li Congke was spared. In 931, Consort Wang received the greater title of Shufei. Later in the year, believing the accusations by the general Zhu Hongzhao that An was plotting rebellion, Li Siyuan had An put to death. After An's death, she and Meng had an even firmer hold on the palace scene, although it was said that Li Siyuan's oldest surviving son (by Lady Xia), Li Congrong the Prince of Qin, paid them ‚Äî or, for that matter, any governmental official ‚Äî no heed. It became so worrisome for his chiefs of staff Fan Yanguang and Zhao Yanshou that both sought to leave the imperial court to become military governors ‚Äî requests that Li Siyuan considered insulting as he believed that they were abandoning him. Zhao was allowed to leave first through the influence of his wife, Li Siyuan's daughter the Princess of Qi (to become the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan)). Fan was subsequently able to leave as well, by persuade Consort Wang and Meng to speak on his behalf (to become the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei)).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Still remembering how Liu Xun treated her well, she made sure that Liu's sons were given governmental positions. Shortly thereafter, with Li Siyuan extremely ill and apparently near death, Li Congrong tried to seize power, but was defeated by the palace guards and killed. It was said that Consort Wang and Meng participated in the actions taken against Li Congrong. When Li Siyuan himself died shortly after, Li Conghou succeeded to the throne.  During Li Conghou's and Li Congke's reigns  After Li Conghou took the throne, he honored Empress Cao as empress dowager. Shortly thereafter, there was a conversation between the wife of one of the imperial guard generals who battled Li Congrong's forces, Zhu Hongshi (), and Li Congyi's wet nurse Lady Wang ‚Äî who had also had been carrying on an affair with Li Congrong. In the conversation, Lady Wang tried to defend Li Congrong's actions and pointed out that Li Congrong had previously treated Zhu well. When Zhu heard this, he, in fear, reported this, as well as Lady Wang's affair with Li Congrong, to Li Conghou. Li Conghou thereafter forced Lady Wang to commit suicide. Because of Lady Wang's status as Li Congyi's wet nurse and because Consort Wang had treated Li Congrong well, Li Conghou began to suspect her. He considered moving her out of the main palace into a subsidiary palace, Zhide Palace (), but because of the close relationship between Empress Dowager Cao and Consort Wang, he worried that this would be hurtful to the empress dowager, and therefore did not do so, but he also did not treat her with great respect. However, he did, in early 934, honored her as consort dowager. Shortly after, Zhu Hongzhao and Feng Yun, who were then serving as Li Conghou's chiefs of staff, apprehensive of the powers that Empress Dowager Cao's son-in-law Shi Jingtang (who was then the military governor (Jiedushi) of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi)) and Li Congke (who was then the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi)) had (as Shi and Li Congke had both been long-time generals under Li Siyuan and were respected by the army),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 279. decided to move them to prevent them from being entrenched. They also wanted to summon their ally Meng Hanqiong, who was then temporarily overseeing the governance of Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), back to Luoyang. They therefore issued a series of orders (without an imperial edict) transferring Li Congke to Hedong, Shi to Chengde, and Fan Yanguang to Tianxiong. However, at that time, many generals who were transferred met ill fates, and Li Congke feared that these actions were intended against him. He thus rebelled, and the army that Li Conghou sent against him, under command of the general Wang Sitong, turned against Wang and surrendered to Li Congke. Li Congke marched on Luoyang, and Li Conghou fled the capital. In the emperor's absence, the officials turned to Empress Dowager Cao, who subsequently issued edicts deposing Li Conghou and declaring Li Congke regent, and then emperor. Li Conghou was subsequently killed in flight ‚Äî as Shi, who was initially intending to support him against Li Congke, also turned against him when he saw how little support Li Conghou had by that point, killed all of his remaining guards and leaving him unable to fend for himself when Li Congke subsequently sent emissaries to kill him. Empress Dowager Cao continued to be empress dowager, and Consort Dowager Wang continued to be consort dowager, but her ally Meng, whom Li Congke believed to be part of the plot against him, was executed. After Li Congke became emperor, there was a time when he held a feast at Consort Dowager Wang's residence. During the feast, she offered to take tonsure to be a Buddhist nun ‚Äî shocking Li Congke, who asked her the reason. She wept and explained stated that she did not know what would happen to Li Congyi. (As Li Siyuan's only surviving biological son ‚Äî as Li Congke was adopted into the household because his mother Lady Wei and he were seized by Li Siyuan on a campaign, and Lady Wei subsequently became a wife or concubine to Li Siyuan ‚Äî she might have feared that conspiracies might arise to make him emperor.) She stated, \\"My young son may have something happen to him. If his older brother will not tolerate him, how will I ever be able to see the deceased Emperor after death?\\" Li Congke was also saddened, and he treated her well. In 936, Shi, after Li Congke issued an edict transferring him to Tianping Circuit (Â§©Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong), rebelled, and, allying with the Khitan Empire's Emperor Taizong, defeated the Later Tang troops that Li Congke sent against him. He then marched toward Luoyang. Believing that defeat was inevitable, Li Congke gathered his family members, including Empress Dowager Cao, and a group of officers still loyal to him, to commit suicide by fire. Consort Dowager Wang tried to persuade Empress Dowager Cao not to participate in the mass suicide ‚Äî noting to her that Shi was her son-in-law. Empress Dowager Cao rejected her overture, stating:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. Consort Dowager Wang thus took Li Congyi and Princess Yong'an, hid at a polo field, and did not participate in the mass suicide, but Empress Dowager Cao joined and died in the mass suicide. Shi, whom Emperor Taizong had declared the emperor of a new Later Jin, arrived at Luoyang shortly thereafter and took over the realm.  During Later Jin  After the establishment of the Later Jin court, Consort Dowager Wang again requested to become a Buddhist nun. Shi Jingtang did not agree, and moved her to Zhide Palace. After Shi moved the capital from Luoyang to Kaifeng in 937,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi were also moved to Kaifeng and took up residence in the palace, with Shi Jingtang's wife Empress Li (Li Siyuan's and Empress Cao's daughter) personally overseeing Li Congyi's upbringing and treating Consort Dowager Wang like a mother. In 939, Shi also created Li Congyi the Duke of Xun and put him in charge of sacrificing to five emperors of Tang Dynasty (which Later Tang claimed to be legitimate successor to) and Later Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Shi Jingtang died in 942, and was succeeded as emperor by his nephew Shi Chonggui.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. After Shi Chonggui's succession, Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi returned to Luoyang and took up residence there. In contrast to Shi Jingtang's view of Khitan's Emperor Taizong (who had changed the name of his state to Liao by this point) as a benefactor ‚Äî going as far as referring to himself as \\"Son Emperor\\" and \\"subject\\" while honoring Emperor Taizong as \\"Father Emperor\\" ‚Äî Shi Chonggui, at the advice of the general Jing Yanguang, took a confrontational stance against the Khitan, initially only referring to himself as \\"grandson\\" and not as subject, and eventually went as far as closing the Liao trade office, seizing its assets, and killing Khitan merchants. This led to repeated Liao incursions. In 946, Shi Chonggui launched a punitive expedition, commanded by the generals Du Wei (the husband of one of Shi JIngtang's sisters) and Li Shouzhen, but Emperor Taizong defeated and then induced Du and Li Shouzhen to surrender to him. He then attacked south. With nearly the entire Later Jin army given to Du and Li Shouzhen for the expedition, Kaifeng was defenseless, and Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285.  After Later Jin's destruction  After Emperor Taizong entered Kaifeng, he claimed to be the emperor of China (i.e., the former Later Jin realm) as well.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Meanwhile, the wife of Zhao Yanshou (who had served Liao ever since his capture by Emperor Taizong in the campaign of Later Tang's destruction) had died by this point, and Emperor Taizong thus wanted to give Princess Yong'an to Zhao in marriage as his next wife. As her mother, Consort Dowager Wang went to Kaifeng for the ceremony. When Emperor Taizong saw her, he, claiming that he and Li Siyuan had previously agreed to be blood brothers, bowed to her, greeting her as a sister-in-law. Meanwhile, Liu Xun's son Liu Suining () asked her to intercede for him to ask for a military governorship, and she did. Emperor Taizong thus commissioned Liu Suining as the military governor of Anyuan Circuit (ÂÆâÈÅ†, headquartered in modern Xiaogan, Hubei). He also commissioned Li Congyi as the military governor of Weixin Circuit (Â®Å‰ø°, headquartered in modern Heze, Shandong) and created Li Congyi the Prince of Xu. Believing that Li Congyi was still too young, Consort Dowager Wang declined the opportunity to have him report to the post, and took him back to Luoyang. Emperor Taizong, despite his desire to rule over the former Later Jin realms, treated it poorly, allowing his soldiers to pillage the realm. This led to many armed rebellions against him, and he, troubled by the situation, decided to head back to Khitan territory, leaving his brother-in-law Xiao Han in charge at Kaifeng. He became ill on the way, and died near Heng Prefecture (ÊÅÜÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang), plunging the succession into a battle between his nephew Yel√º Ruan (supported by the army that attacked south, and who then declared himself emperor, as Emperor Shizong) and his brother Yel√º Lihu (supported by his mother Empress Dowager Shul√º). Xiao wanted to abandon Kaifeng himself, particularly with one of the rebellion leaders, the Later Jin general Liu Zhiyuan (who had declared himself the emperor of a new Later Han) bearing down toward Luoyang and Kaifeng, but feared that, with Han rebellions already overtaken the realm, if he simply abandoned Kaifeng, he might be caught in such a disturbance that he could not withdraw safely. He sent the officer Gao Mohan () to Luoyang under the name of the deceased Emperor Taizong, summoning Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi to Kaifeng. Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi tried to hide themselves at Li Siyuan's tomb, but were discovered by Gao and his soldiers and forced to report to Kaifeng. Once there, Xiao declared Li Congyi emperor and, after leaving some of the soldiers from Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing, ceded by Shi Jingtang to Liao in appreciation of its support of him) to help defend Kaifeng, departed. Consort Dowager Wang realized that this left her and Li Congyi in a disastrous position, and when the officials left at Kaifeng greeted her, she wept and stated, :\\"We, mother and son, are left in such a vulnerable position, but you, lords, pushed us to this position; this will bring disaster on our household!\\" She tried to firm up Kaifeng's defenses by summoning Gao Xingzhou the military governor of Guide Circuit (Ê≠∏Âæ∑, headquartered in modern Shangqiu, Henan) and Wu Xingde () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), but neither paid her any heed. She, in fear, stated to the officials, :\\"We, mother and son, had been forced by Xiao Han into destruction. But you, lords, are sinless. You should quickly welcome the new emperor to seek your own fortune. Do not worry about us!\\" The officials were touched by her, and none left. When she subsequently consulted them, some advocated resisting Liu, arguing that if they could hold out for a month, Liao would send reinforcements. Consort Dowager Wang, however, believed that resistance would be useless and that a siege would be disastrous to the people of Kaifeng, and therefore resolved to surrender. She thus had Li Congyi, using the lesser title of Prince of Liang, submit a petition welcoming Liu to Kaifeng, and they moved out of the palace into a private residence. This overture, however, could not save her or Li Congyi. Liu subsequently entered Luoyang and, receiving the petition, sent his officer Guo Congyi () to Kaifeng with instructions to kill Consort Dowager Wang and Li Congyi. As Consort Dowager Wang was facing death, she wept and stated, \\"My son was put into this position by the Khitan. What crime did he have to deserve death? Why not allow him to live, such that each year, at Cold Food Festival, he could sacrifice a bowl of wheat grains to the tomb of Emperor Mingzong?\\" It was said that whoever heard of what she said were touched to weep for her fate.

Stekenjokk also is close to B√∏rgefjell National Park on the Norwegian side. In 2012, for a few months the Stekenjokk area was closed for visitors because thieves stole birds' eggs from nests in Stekenjokk's nature reserve. The grounds remained closed to the public until the snowfall ended and the birds had the opportunity to lay new eggs. The grounds reopened for the public in late 2012. In 2013, Vilhelmina Mineral AB submitted an application to open two new mineral mines in Stekenjokk. The V√§sterbotten council denied the application in November of that year stating that the new mines would disrupt and disturb the reindeer in the area.

The area is known for its wilderness and skiing opportunities. Vildmarksv√§gen, a wilderness road, bypasses the hamlet. Stora Bl√•sj√∂n has a moose farm and a school museum. Location Stora Bl√•sj√∂n is located about north of √ñstersund and from Sweden's border with Norway. The Vildmarksv√§gen road passes from the north of Stora Bl√•sj√∂n and motorists driving to the village using the wilderness road first encounter the lake, which mirrors the nearby Mesklumpen mountain that is situated in close proximity to the village. History Stora Bl√•sj√∂n was founded in 1799 by a farmer from Norway and another from the hamlet of Jormvattnet. During the 1950s, the population was about 200 people, the highest number of permanent residents in Stora Bl√•sj√∂n's history. As of July 2010, it was referred the population was 78 residents. Stora Bl√•sj√∂n became nationally known in 1971 when about 20 workers from the copper mine in Stekenjokk went on a hunger strike in the town after not being paid for their work at the mine.

The lake is divided into two segments, Stora Bl√•sj√∂n and Lilla Bl√•sj√∂n (). The rivers Ankar√§lven and Lejar√§lven are tributaries to the lake. The level of the lake is artificially adjusted by allowing water to flow out. The water outflow passes through Bl√•sj√∂√§lven and is further directed through an underground waterway to the generating station at Bl√•sj√∂fallet, finally draining into Lake Stor-Jorm. Local fish species include trout and charr. Attractions Around Stora Bl√•sj√∂n there is a lot of wilderness where guests can go on walks, hunt, or fish. The waterfall of Brakk√•fallet is located on the route of the Vildmarksv√§gen between Stora Bl√•sj√∂n and Jorm. Sweden's longest cave, the Korallgrottan () is found between Stora Bl√•sj√∂n and Ankarvattnet along Vildmarksv√§gen.

The Downtown Triangle (, Ha- Meshulash, lit. \\"The Triangle\\"; ) is a central commercial and entertainment district in Western Jerusalem. Measuring , the area is bounded by Jaffa Road on the north, King George Street on the west, and Ben Yehuda Street on the southeast. Its vertices are the intersections of Jaffa Road and King George Street, King George and Ben Yehuda Streets, and Ben Yehuda Street and Jaffa Road (the latter known as Zion Square). From the mid-1940s through the 1960s, the Triangle was the commercial and cultural heart of Jerusalem, with many upscale shops and restaurants operated by German-Jewish immigrant businessmen that appealed to an affluent clientele. Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967 and the expansion of the city away from the downtown core, the commercial viability of the Triangle declined. The area was revitalized by the conversion of Ben Yehuda Street and the interior streets of the Triangle to an open-air pedestrian mall in 1982. Over the next two decades, outdoor cafes and souvenir shops moved in, cementing the reputation of the Triangle as a popular shopping and entertainment venue for tourists and young Israelis. History Intersection of King George Street (foreground), Straus Street (background), and Jaffa Road (right and left), 1924. Before the British Mandatory government took over in 1917, the main commercial district in Jerusalem was in the Old City. With an eye to the continuing development of new neighborhoods outside the Old City Walls, the British drew up a master town plan that called for the establishment of two commercial hubs in the New City. The first commercial district to be built was the Downtown Triangle, although it was intended to play a secondary role to the other planned commercial district in the Mamilla area, which was closer to the Old City. However, the Mamilla development did not garner as much interest as the Triangle. The land used for the Downtown Triangle had been purchased by the Jewish Colonization Association from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which began selling off some of its holdings in Jerusalem after World War I. The British developed the field into a triangular district (hence its appellation, \\"The Triangle\\") demarcated by Jaffa Road, Ben Yehuda Street (constructed by the British in 1922) and King George Street (constructed by the British in 1924). Lots were sold to large companies and cooperatives as well as private businesses. Other streets adjacent to the Triangle ‚Äì Shlomzion Hamalka, Mamilla, Agron, and King David Streets ‚Äì were zoned for commercial and residential use. European ambience Cafe Europe, located in the Sansur Building at Zion Square, circa 1934‚Äì1946. According to Jerusalem architectural historian David Kroyanker, the heyday of the Downtown Triangle lasted from the early 1930s to the 1970s. Many stores and restaurants were opened by German Jewish immigrants who sought to recreate a European ambience in the city center. Their upscale boutiques, coffeehouses, delicatessens, and exclusive restaurants were frequented by senior Mandate officials and wealthy, English- speaking tourists. Unlike Israeli stores that sold all kinds of unrelated products under one roof, the Europeans introduced boutiques that featured only one item, such as gloves or ties. Some shops offered unique extras, such as coffeehouses that included an orchestra and dance floor, and a bookstore with a second-floor library. The European immigrant-owned bookstores fueled the demand for detective fiction, historical reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported newspapers and magazines and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also the only place where Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods. At its peak, the district was home to 14 cinemas screening the newest Hollywood fare. Located in close proximity to one another, the cinemas would attract both adults and youth, who would afterwards patronize the coffeehouses and restaurants. The Downtown Triangle was the cultural heart of the city and the place \\"to see and be seen\\". (subscription) Architecture The cosmopolitan flavor of the Triangle extended to its buildings. The Sansur building, for example, has an \\"eclectic\\" design that combines \\"neo-Renaissance and classicist elements\\". Approximately 15 buildings in the Triangle were designed by architect Reuven Avraham Rabinowitz, who often added a row of roughly dressed stone to the facade to demarcate each story. Decline and rebirth Ben Yehuda Street pedestrian mall Following the reunification of Jerusalem in 1967, the city embarked on significant expansion. Large commercial centers were opened in the new, outlying neighborhoods of Talpiot, Givat Shaul, and Malha, drawing customers away from the city center. Government offices began moving out as well, precipitating the economic decline of the Downtown Triangle in the 1970s. The clientele of the upscale European boutiques had also aged, and the neighborhoods adjacent to downtown became occupied by poor and Haredi Jews who did not patronize the Triangle. The elegant shops gave way to hummus restaurants, dollar stores, and money changers. The advent of television precipitated the closure of most of the Triangle's cinemas. In 1982, the city attempted to revitalize the downtown district by closing Ben Yehuda Street and the Triangle's interior streets (Luncz, Dorot Rishonim, Yavetz, Ben Hillel, and HaHistadrut Streets) to traffic, and converting the entire area to an open-air pedestrian mall. Though taxi companies demonstrated against the renovation and merchants claimed it would fail, the idea proved successful. Outdoor cafes, pizzerias, and fast-food restaurants moved into the Triangle, together with shops selling souvenirs, Judaica, and jewelry to tourists. Street musicians, street artists, political promoters, and tables manned by Chabad and Breslov Hasidim add to the lively nature of the mall. The pedestrian mall restored the Triangle's reputation as the \\"heart\\" of the city, although the formerly upscale, European tone was replaced by a more populist image. The introduction of the Jerusalem Light Rail in December 2011 further increased local and visitor traffic: estimates show that 36,000 pedestrians per day visited the Triangle in April 2012, up from 16,000 per day in April 2004. The mall is especially busy on Saturday nights, as eateries that have closed for Shabbat reopen and the streets are crowded with young Israelis from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Beginning in the late 1990s, the pedestrian mall became noted for hosting a growing presence of at-risk and homeless youth. Three youth centers ‚Äì Hameshulash, Hezroni's Squat, and The Zone ‚Äì operate in the vicinity of Zion Square. Bombing attacks Car bombs explode on Ben Yehuda Street, 22 February 1948 Due to its centrality and large concentration of visitors and entertainment venues, the Downtown Triangle has been the target of numerous bombing attacks and attempted attacks. On 22 February 1948, three British Army trucks led by an armored car driven by Arab irregulars and British deserters exploded on Ben Yehuda Street, killing 58 Jewish civilians and injuring 140. On 4 July 1975, a refrigerator containing of explosives detonated in Zion Square, killing 15 and wounding 77. On 24 March 1979, a bomb exploded in a trash can in Zion Square, killing one and wounding 13. During the suicide bomber era in the late 1990s, three suicide bombers stationed at different points on Ben Yehuda Street exploded themselves almost simultaneously, causing eight deaths and 277 injuries. A similar \\"relay\\" bombing attack took place on 1 December 2001: Police and emergency medical personnel were rushing to the scene of a double suicide bombing attack in the Triangle when a car bomb exploded; 20 died and 150 were wounded. Earlier, in August, a Sbarro restaurant at the corner of Jaffa Road and King George Street, packed with lunchtime customers, was bombed; 15 people died and 90 were wounded. In February 2014, in response to lobbying by terror victims groups, the Jerusalem municipality held a ceremony and mounted a memorial plaque at the site of the 1948 bombing on Ben Yehuda Street. Landmarks Hamashbir Lazarchan department store at Zion Square. Freimann & Bein shoe store on Jaffa Road The tallest building in the Triangle is the seven-story, Hamashbir Lazarchan department store, which opened on the eastern side of Zion Square in 2011. It is the largest department store in Israel and the flagship store of the 38-store chain. Hamashbir is intimately associated with the Downtown Triangle, as the first Hamashbir store was established across the street from its current location in 1947, and moved to another vertex of the Triangle, at King George and Ben Yehuda Streets, from 1970 to 2010. Freimann and Bein (50 Jaffa Road) was the first luxury shoe store in Israel. Founded by German-Jewish immigrants, it imported quality leather shoes from Europe and attracted a clientele of British officers and Arab sheikhs. The store originally opened in the Generali Building further east on Jaffa Road in 1935 and moved to 50 Jaffa Road in 1947. It closed in 2014. Khalifa Shoes (44 Jaffa Road), founded in 1954, is a Jewish family-owned business specializing in Israeli-made shoes and sandals. The longest-lasting dining establishments in the Triangle were Atara Cafe and Fink's Bar. Atara Cafe operated at 7 Ben Yehuda Street from 1938 to 1996. The European-style coffeehouse was a favorite of Mandate officers, pre-state paramilitary groups, and Israeli politicians, journalists, and bohemians. Fink's Bar, at the corner of King George and HaHistadrut Streets, was open from 1936 to 2006. The intimate, exclusive restaurant was one of the most prestigious dining addresses in Jerusalem. Specializing in European cuisine, the restaurant/bar made its kitchen kosher in 2003 in order to overcome several years of declining business and broaden its customer base beyond \\"politicians, journalists and diplomats\\". The Downtown Triangle includes two hotels. Kikar Zion Hotel (Zion Square Hotel), which faced Zion Square from the south, occupied the site of the former Zion Cinema that gave the square its name. The cinema was demolished in 1972 and a high-rise building containing the Kikar Zion Hotel (on the upper floors) and a branch of Bank Hapoalim (on the lower floors) was erected. As of 2016, the hotel was being renovated for reopening as the Herbert Samuel Hotel. On the northern side of Zion Square stands the Jerusalem Hostel. This lodging opened as the Tel Aviv Hotel in 1926 and later became known as the Ron Hotel. Menachem Begin stood on one of the hotel's balconies on 3 August 1948, to announce the dissolution of the Irgun and the sign-up of his soldiers with the Israel Defense Forces.

Vildmarksv√§gen (), sometimes called Stekenjokkv√§gen by people living in Stekenjokk, which crosses Vildmarksv√§gen, is a tourist road stretching from northern J√§mtland to southern Lapland, Sweden. It begins in Str√∂msund and ends in Vilhelmina. Part of the road is closed during winter at times because of heavy snow, which can reach up to . In 2012 the Frostvikens Fj√§llpark was open in G√§ddede as part of the Vildmarksv√§gen. Vildmarksv√§gen also hosts the Bjur√§lven nature reserve. Route The route of Vildmarksv√§gen begins in Str√∂msund. It continues to the town of G√§ddede and Road 342, then passes through Jormvattnet, Stora Bl√•sj√∂n, and Stekenjokk, and on to Klimpfj√§ll. From there it continues to Kultsj√∂n and Saxn√§s via Stalon and Lake Moalgomaj, on to Vilhelmina. Parts of the road through Kalfj√§llet are closed at times during winter because of heavy snow, and the Stekkenjokk plateau is also closed from mid-October to the beginning of June. Highlights The Vildmarksv√§gen crosses a region that has the greatest concentration of bears in Sweden. right The area spanned by the road is very scenic and has many rivers and waterfalls. One of the waterfalls, H√§llings√•fallet (which also is a nature reserve), drains into the longest water canyon of Northern Europe. With a drop of , H√§llings√•fallet has been called \\"Sweden's answer to Niagara Falls\\". H√§llings√•fallet's canyon is long and, due to ongoing soil erosion, its length is still increasing. Vildmarksv√§gen passes near Gaustafallet, another waterfall which also drains into a gorge. This waterfall was one of the locations for a film by Astrid Lindgren, titled Ronia the Robber's Daughter. Although the area is similar in size to V√§stra G√∂taland County, which has a population of 1,590,000, the population in the wilderness area is only 22,000, resulting in a population density of less than 1 person per km2. The waterfall of Brakk√•fallet is located on the route of Vildmarksv√§gen between Jorm and Stora Bl√•sj√∂n. Sweden's longest cave, the Korallgrottan is found between Stora Bl√•sj√∂n and Ankarvattnet along Vildmarksv√§gen. As Vildmarksv√§gen winds eastward it passes near the Sami village of Fatmomakke, a community built with a church at its centre. The community lives in 80 traditional goahti as well as 20 more modern homes which are constructed radially around the church. Twenty wooden huts are also found on the shore of Kultsj√∂n lake. There is also a visningsk√•ta, model hut, built on an elevation near the church. Along the route between Str√∂msund and G√§ddede are several outdoor military museums. Skansen Alan√§s is one of four sites (the others being Skansen Stor√•n, Skansen Sjuls√•sen and Skansen F√•gelberget) which can be visited as part of a bunker tour in the area. These military installations were built between 1940 and 1945 to defend the area against German invasion during World War II. Guided tours are held during the summer months.

It carries out driving tests, approves people to be driving instructors and MOT testers, carries out tests to make sure lorries and buses are safe to drive, carries out roadside checks on drivers and vehicles, and monitors vehicle recalls. The responsibilities of DVSA only cover Great Britain. In Northern Ireland the same role is carried out by the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA). History It was announced on 20 June 2013 that the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) and Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) would merge into a single agency in 2014. The name of the new agency was confirmed as the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) on 28 November 2013. DSA and VOSA closed on 31 March 2014, and DVSA took over their responsibilities on 1 April 2014. Purpose and aims DVSA's stated purpose is \\"helping you stay safe on Britain's roads\\". It does this by: * helping people through a lifetime of safe driving * helping people keep their vehicles safe to drive * protecting people from unsafe drivers and vehicles On 30 March 2017, DVSA published a strategy for 2017 to 2022 setting out how it would do this. Responsibilities DVSA is responsible for: * setting the standard for safe and responsible driving and riding * carrying out theory and practical driving tests for all types of motor vehicles * maintaining the register of approved driving instructors * approving training bodies and instructors to provide compulsory basic training and direct access scheme courses for motorcyclists * running the tests that allow people to join and stay on the voluntary register of driver trainers who train drivers of car and van fleets * setting the standards for the drink-drive rehabilitation scheme, running the scheme and approving the courses that offenders can take * conducting annual testing of lorries, buses and trailers through authorised testing facilities (ATFs) and goods vehicle testing stations (GVTS) * conducting routine and targeted checks on vehicles, drivers and operators ensuring compliance with road safety legislation and environmental standards * supervising the MOT scheme so that over 20,000 authorised garages carry out MOT tests to the correct standards * providing administrative support to the Traffic Commissioners in considering and processing applications for licenses to operate lorries, buses, coaches and registered bus services * conducting post-collision investigations * monitoring products for manufacturing or design defects, highlighting safety concerns and monitoring safety recalls * providing a range of educational and advisory activities to promote road safety Enforcement Examiners The DVSA appoints Vehicle Examiners to stop and check vehicles for defects and compliance.. They wear uniform, which consists of a shirt and tie/polo shirt, high visibility coat, trousers, boots and a white-topped cap with a green and white chequered cap band (similar to police traffic officers). Powers Under the Police Reform Act 2002, section 41 and Schedule 5, Chief Constables could grant powers (under a Community Safety Accreditation Scheme) to - formerly VOSA and now DVSA - officers to stop vehicles, for checks on vehicle and driver compliance without the need for police support (later expanded to stop any vehicle, although mainly goods and passenger carrying vehicles). At that time, only police officers had the power to stop vehicles and therefore had to be present. The powers were piloted in 2003 and brought more widely into force in 2004. Following a consultation in July 2010, \\"http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/closed/2010-27/consultation.pdf the law was overhauled in 2011 to grant VOSA/DVSA officers the power to stop vehicles without relying on police approval through Community Safety Accreditation Schemes as above. This also allowed VOSA/DVSA officers to stop vehicles in Scotland, as well as in England and Wales as previously. The amendment, which was made by the Road Vehicles (Powers to Stop) Regulations 2011, allows \\"stopping officers\\" approved by the Department for Transport to stop vehicles for certain reasons.

G. Wells from among the many short essays and ephemeral pieces he had written since 1893.David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 35-37. \\"Most of Wells's ephemeral pieces have not been collected, and many have not even been identified as his. Wells did not automatically receive the byline his reputation demanded until after 1896 or so. Some journals had a policy of giving only one byline an issue, no matter how many pieces an author contributed to it. Wells also occasionally used pseudonyms, although these are ordinarily very easy to spot. His style became increasingly recognizable, and eventually he collected a number of these magazine pieces in two early volumes [Select Conversations with an Uncle and Certain Personal Matters] . . . As a result, many of his early pieces are known. Some knowledge also comes from a list compiled by Jane Wells [i.e. Catherine Robbins Wells, Wells's second wife] in the First World War period. But it obvious that many early Wells items have been lost. . . . Of course, Wells himself may have been unwilling to have some of his early published work reprinted, although the correspondence does not suggest that he was ashamed of much that he wrote\\" (p. 35). The book consists of thirty-nine pieces ranging from about eight hundred\\"How I Died,\\" the last piece in the collection, written in 1897. to two thousand words\\"Of a Book Unwritten,\\" a speculation about the future evolution of Homo sapiens. in length. A one-shilling reprint (two shillings in cloth) was issued in 1901 by T. Fisher Unwin. The essays in Certain Personal Matters are written from a consistent first-person perspective, but only one (ironically, given the title) describes an identifiable event in Wells's life --how he responded to being diagnosed with tuberculosis in the fall of 1887.\\"How I Died,\\" the volume's concluding piece. The diagnosis of a fatal illness, which came about a month after Wells incurred a serious internal injury while playing rugby on Aug. 30, 1887, proved to be mistaken. Wells describes three phases of his reaction. \\"My first phase was an immense sorrow for myself. . . . Then presently the sorrow broadened . . . I thought more of the world's loss, and less of my own. . . . This lasted . . . nearly four months,\\" until one day on a springtime walk \\"I quite forgot I was a Doomed Man. . . . For a moment I tried in vain to think what it was had slipped my memory. Then it came, colourless and remote. 'Oh! Death.... He's a Bore,' I said; 'I've done with him,' and laughed to think of having done with him. 'And why not so?' said I.\\" (These are the concluding words of Certain Personal Matters.) The other essays adopt the playful persona of an aspiring young writer living in modest circumstances with a wife, Euphemia, who is only sketchily and obliquely described. Their tone reflects the demands of the market in London magazines for \\"short essays, or short stories, often with a twist, which can be read in half a dozen minutes, but which will pique a reader's attention and ultimately allow him to think, 'How true. I have done that myself', or to make some similar remark.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 35. More than half of the essays are humorous social satire; serious subjects are addressed only ironically. Politics, historical and economic topics, and identifiable portraiture are eschewed. Ten essays have literary themes, and in these, too, the point of view is humorous. One (\\"On Schooling and the Phases of Mr. Sandsome\\") gently critiques the choice of subjects studied in the course of primary and secondary education. Half a dozen essays engage scientific themes, especially natural selection and evolution, and in \\"The Extinction of Man\\" Wells shows he is contemplating themes that would be expressed in his next novel, The War of the Worlds: \\"Even now, for all we can tell, the coming terror may be crouching for its spring and the fall of humanity may be at hand.\\" Composition and Publication The essays in Certain Personal Matters rely on stock characters that Wells developed in his early days as a writer. This vein was inspired by his reading of When a Man's Single, an 1888 novel by J.M. Barrie, in which a character explains that saleable articles can be devised from everyday things like pipes, umbrellas, and flower pots.Norman and Jeanne MacKenzie, H.G. Wells: A Biography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1973), p. 95. According to biographer David C. Smith, one character is \\"probably based on his father (and perhaps partly on his older brothers), another based on his mother apparently (although the character is always referred to as an 'aunt', which may be somewhat symbolic), and a third character, 'Euphemia'. This last is usually thought to be a portrait of Jane [Catherine] Wells, though the figure may have some traits of Isabel [Wells's cousin and first wife] as well.\\"David C. Smith, H.G. Wells: Desperately Mortal: A Biography (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 35. \\"Wells naturally retained affection for the writings that had launched his career, so much so that he became embroiled in a furious dispute about the contents and title page with the publisher, who eventually had to call in Gissing to act as a mediator and persuade Wells to climb down.\\"Michael Sherborne, H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life (Peter Owens, 2010), p. 125. Certain Personal Matters was well received; one critic called it \\"a very pleasant moneysworth, full of wit and humour.\\" The book sold well and was never remaindered.David C. Smith, H.G.

These milefortlets and intervening stone watchtowers extended from the western end of Hadrian's Wall, along the Cumbrian coast and were linked by a wooden palisade. They were contemporary with defensive structures on Hadrian's Wall. The exact location of Milefortlet 13 is unknown, although two of the nearby turrets (Towers 13A and 13B) have been located and excavated. Description Milefortlet 13 was situated on the coast between the villages of Blitterlees and Beckfoot, in the civil parish of Holme Low. The milefortlet has never been located, but its approximate position has been calculated from the positions of other Roman fortlets. Exploratory excavations were conducted in 1954 without finding any remains. A geophysical survey was conducted in 1994 with inconclusive results. However, the geophysical survey did locate a possible fortlet ditch (), and noted three parallel lines which might have been the ditches of the coastal defences.  Associated Towers  Each milefortlet had two associated towers, similar in construction to the turrets built along Hadrian's Wall. These towers were positioned approximately one-third and two- thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milefortlet, and would probably have been manned by part of the nearest Milefortlet's garrison. The towers associated with Milefortlet 13 are known as Tower 13A () and Tower 13B (). The site of Tower 13A was identified by excavation in 1954. The foundations of the tower were found, and were 3.75 metres square internally. Pottery fragments were found, and a coin of Hadrian. The remains of a modern dike cross the site. The site of Tower 13B is located in a field on high ground, and was excavated in 1880. The foundations were found 6 metres square externally, and 3.75 metres square internally. A few sherds of pottery were found. The 1880 excavations also uncovered a possible Roman pavement located between Tower 13A and Tower 13B.

It was an important victory at the start of a period when the Kingdom of Jerusalem would expand to its greatest extent under King Baldwin II. The Venetians gained valuable trading concessions in Tyre. Through raids on Byzantine territory both on the way to the Holy Land and on the return journey, the Venetians forced the Byzantines to confirm, as well as extend, their trading privileges with the empire. Preparation Baldwin de Burg was a nephew of Baldwin I of Jerusalem and the Count of Edessa from 1100 to 1118. In 1118 his uncle died and he became King Baldwin II of Jerusalem. In the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, fought near Sarmada on 28 June 1119, the Franks suffered a disastrous defeat by the forces of Ilghazi, the ruler of Mardin. Later that year Baldwin regained some territory, but the Franks were seriously weakened. Baldwin asked for help from Pope Callixtus II. The pope forwarded the request to Venice. The terms of the crusade were agreed through negotiations between the envoys of Baldwin II and the doge of Venice. Once the Venetians decided to participate, Callixtus sent them his papal banner to signify his approval, At the First Council of the Lateran he confirmed that the Venetions had crusader privileges, including remission of their sins. The church also extended its protection to the families and property of the crusaders. In 1122 the Doge of Venice, Domenico Michiel, launched the seaborne crusade. The Venetian fleet of more than 120 ships carrying over 15,000 men left the Venetian Lagoon on 8 August 1122. This seems to have been the first crusade in which the knights brought their horses with them. They invested Corfu, then a possession of the Byzantine Empire, with which Venice had a dispute over privileges. In 1123 Baldwin II was captured by Balak of Mardin, emir of Aleppo, and imprisoned in Kharput. Eustace Graverius became regent of Jerusalem. The Venetians abandoned the siege of Corfu when they heard this news, and reached the Palestinian coast in May 1123. Battle of Jaffa Outremer around 1100 The Venetian fleet arrived at Acre at the end of May and was informed about a Fatimid fleet, of around a hundred sail, sailing towards Ascalon in order to assist the Emir Balak at his siege. Thus the Venetian fleet sailed south in order to meet it and Doge Michele ordered the division of the fleet into two parts with the weaker force at the helm and the stronger one hiding behind it. With the intent to divert the fleet off Ascalon. The Egyptians fell into the trap assuming an easy victory they were now caught between two Venetian squadrons and outnumbered. Some 4,000 Saracens were killed including the Fatimid admiral and 9 vessels captured with the Venetians adding to their triumph the capture of 10 merchant vessels en route back to Acre. Both Fulcher of Chartres (Book III/20) and William of Tyre (Book XII/22-23) recorded the event. Siege of Tyre On 15 February 1124, the Venetians and the Franks began the siege of Tyre. The seaport of Tyre, now in Lebanon, was part of the territory of Toghtekin, the Atabeg of Damascus. The Latin army was led by the Patriarch of Antioch, the doge of Venice, Pons, Count of Tripoli and William de Bury, the king's constable. The Venetians and Franks built siege towers and machines that could throw boulders to shatter the city walls. The defenders of Tyre also built engines, hurling rocks at the siege towers. As the siege dragged on, the citizens began to run short of food and sent urgent calls for help. Balak died while besieging the city of Hierapolis. Toghtekin advanced towards Tyre, but withdrew without fighting when the forces of Count Pons of Tripoli and Constable William rode to confront him. Toghtekin sent envoys in June 1124 to negotiate peace. After lengthy and difficult discussions it was agreed that the terms of surrender would include letting those who wanted to leave the city to take their families and property with them, while those who wanted to stay would keep their houses and possessions. This was unpopular with some of the crusaders, who wanted to loot the city. Tyre surrendered on 29 June 1124. After the crusader forces entered the city, according to William of Tyre, \\"They admired the fortifications of the city, the strength of the buildings, the massive walls and lofty towers, the noble harbour so difficult of access. They had only praise for the resolute perseverance of the citizens who, despite the pressure of terrible hunger and the scarcity of supplies, had been able to ward off surrender for so long. For when our forces took possession of the place they found only five measures of wheat in the city.\\" Aftermath Baldwin II was in captivity during the conquest of Tyre, but was released later that year. He immediately broke the terms of his release. Baldwin II granted the Venetians extensive commercial privileges in Tyre, and thus ensured that they would maintain a naval presence in the Latin East. The privilege included guarantees of property rights for the heirs of Venetians who were shipwrecked or who died in Tyre. Many of the people who left Tyre moved to Damascus. Baldwin II resumed hostilities against Aleppo and Damascus, and obtained tribute from both states. Under Baldwin II the kingdom of Jerusalem grew to its greatest extent. Tyre prospered as part of the kingdom of Jerusalem. When the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa died during the Third Crusade he was buried in the Tyre Cathedral. The town was captured and destroyed by the Mamluks in 1291. The Venetian fleet passed through the Aegean Sea on the return voyage. The Venetians again pillaged Greek islands. The Greeks were forced to abandon the dispute and confirm the commercial privileges of Venice.

It is aimed at hikers and mountaineers, a similar audience to the Canadian Alpine Journal or a guidebook. The articles are supported by a GIS database and mapping system. The organization maintains a structured database of mountains for all Canada with access trails and backroads. The online reference database has about 30,000 mountains, 4000 backroads and 3000 trails. The initial core of the website was the mountain, road and trail databases. In 2009, a project was begun to upgrade the road and trail database, taking advantage of the newer air photos currently available via Google Earth. This has resulted in numerous corrections to previous data based on government maps. Roads and trails were classified and color coded according to their current conditions reported by about 7000 road bulletins written by eyewitness users of the roads. In October 2000, a major project involving about 30 volunteer editors was begun to catalog every Canadian and US mountain. The initial scope was to catalog every peak over 300 meters of topographic prominence. The source of the data in Canada was the 1:50,000 series National Topographic Series maps, and in the United States, the USGS maps. In British Columbia the source was the TRIM data published by British Columbia Basemap. The catalog involved charting and cataloging many peaks without official name. Many of these peaks had \\"standing names\\" in the previous authoritative guidebooks such as Climber's Guide to the Rocky Mountains of Canada, first published in 1921, and \\"A Guide to Climbing and Hiking in Southwestern British Columbia\\" published in 1986 by Bruce Fairley, and these were adopted by Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia. Previously uncharted peaks were assigned letter codes, geographic names and provisional names. The first phase of the cataloging was completed in 2003 and from then on, a steady trickle of updates were made as errors were reported. In 2012, a major project was begun to systematically recheck every peak, now plotted on the newer mapping systems of the website.

Its purpose was to protect heirs and their estates when the heir was deemed to be a minor and therefore incapable of acting independently. Estates would be managed on behalf of the heir, who would also be educated and nurtured through the offices of the Court in order to ensure that he gained the necessary skills to manage his inheritance independently. Control of the estates would in normal circumstances return to the heir on his coming of age. Rulers in India had some informal provisions for the physical protection of their young heirs before the European control of large parts of the sub- continent, as exemplified by Humayun leaving his young son safely in the care of his brother Askari, even though the two had an acrimonious relationship. The usefulness of creating a Court of Wards in the country was recognised by Philip Francis, a member of the Council of Bengal, as early as 1773, but it was not until August 1797 that the institution was finally established in the Presidency of Bengal by the Governor-General, Sir John Shore. The court had powers of supervision regarding the finances and upbringing of the heirs to estates, in the event that an estate owner died or was incapacitated. Its powers extended as far as allowing the Court to choose different heirs, to dissolve successions, and to take direct control of estates, including taking such control over lands and revenues as was found necessary to protect the interests of the British. Similar institutions were later established in other areas controlled by the East India Company - Assam, the Bombay Presidency, the Central Provinces, the North West Frontier Province, Orissa, the Punjab, Sindh, and the United Provinces - and were emulated by rulers such as the raja of the Gadwal samasthan. Less similar was the body created to serve the self- governing princely state of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Court of Wards continued in the era of the British Raj. Estates sometimes welcomed the intervention of the Court of Wards because the stewardship of the British authorities, who invested funds wisely, had a tendency to boost their economic position. They were often badly managed prior to the involvement of the court because complex systems, influenced by both nepotism and sycophancy, dramatically affected the rental income of the ruling families. The bureaucratic system introduced by the Court, whose appointed officials had no ties to the area, resolved the issue although, being focussed entirely on what was best for the owners, it did so without considering the consequences for the tenants.

It was completed by 1943 but never flew and the sole example was destroyed during the German occupation of Italy. Design and development The Borea was the last Teichfuss glider to be completed. It was a two-seat aircraft, designed primarily for record breaking, a cantilever mid-wing machine with a long span, strongly straight tapered gull wing, ending in elliptical tips. The inner sections of the wing, about one third of the span, had about 10¬∞ of dihedral but the outer sections none. Ailerons filled the whole trailing edges of these outer panels. There were airbrakes at mid-chord. The Borea seated two in side-by side configuration and so its generally ovoid section, plywood covered fuselage was broad and almost circular in the cockpit area. Ahead and overlapping the wing leading edge, the canopy was multi-framed and blended into the fuselage. Aft of the wings the fuselage tapered markedly to the tailplane, which was mounted just above the fuselage on a very short pedestal. The tailplane and elevators together were straight tapered and round tipped, the elevators unbalanced and with a cut-out for rudder movement. A small fin mounted a full, rounded and balanced rudder which reached down to the keel, protected by an underfin/tail bumper. The Borea was completed but not flown.

History  Bellyboarding is the oldest form of surfing from ancient Hawaii & the Polynesian islands. The board design was based on the ancient Hawaiian Paipo boards (Paipo meaning short or small board). In Hawaii people learnt the art of riding prone on these short wooden boards before they attempted to stand up on the longer \\"alaia\\" boards. The boards were made of Gaboon wood or of Paulownia wood. It appeared in the United Kingdom in the very early 1900s, especially in Cornwall and Devon on the English Channel. It was introduced to the United Kingdom by pioneering Perranporth watermen George Tamblyn and William Saunders, soldiers of WWI in 1918, having been inspired by stories from South African & Commonwealth soldiers they had met and swapped stories with in the trenches. Tom Tremewan, a relation of George Tamblyn, and the local undertaker, came up with the first bellyboard/surfboard in the UK, made out of coffin lids. These men became the first bellyboard riders of the UK, also known as coffin board/lid surfing. Bellyboarding bloomed again after WWII as British soldiers returned home. And by rich British people who travelled to Hawai and learned surf and decades later in the 1950s and 60s. It decreased with the development of bodyboard on polystyrene boards and of actual surfing. The World Bellyboard Championships, held each year at Chapel Porth in Cornwall, try to revive this sport. The first session took place in 2002 with 20 competitors. Some years later, there were more than 150 competitors also from Australia, USA and the British Virgin Islands.  Materials  Generally, the board used in bellyboarding is a thin board of plywood. The nose of the board is up curved up. There are no swin fins. There is no leash because the board is easier to manage and to keep in hand. Wetsuits are not necessary because the skin is not irritated by the wood, as polystyrene of bodyboards do.

Biography  Brauns was born in Hamburg, West Germany, and spent the first two years of his life in the quarter Eimsb√ºttel. In 1965, his family moved to Hamburg-Gro√ü Flottbek. There Brauns went to a kindergarten, an elementary school and a gymnasium, where he did his Abitur at 19 years of age.Rose, Katharina.

He then began studying for a degree in Business Administration and Law at the University of Hamburg, but left it in 1984, to focus solely on writing. In 2000, Brauns founded a literary salon, and since 2002, he has been working as a tax advisor.  Career as writer and filmmaker  Brauns, who has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, wrote an autobiography called Buntschatten und Flederm√§use ‚Äì Leben in einer anderen Welt (Coloured Shadows and Bats ‚Äì Living in Another World), which spans the years from 1965 to 1983, and presents his view of the world. He won the Literaturf√∂rderpreis der Stadt Hamburg for an excerpt from it, after which Hoffmann und Campe offered to publish it. Coloured Shadows and Bats came out in 2002, and reached the bestseller list of Der Spiegel in the same year. In 2003, Brauns was nominated for the Deutscher B√ºcherpreis, in the category \\"Most successful debut\\". In 2004, Brauns produced his first feature film, called Tsunami und Steinhaufen. It premiered in 2008. In September 2004, Brauns's novel Kraniche und Klopfer came out. It tells the story of a fictional girl named Adina Adelung, who lives in a house with her brother and mother. Her mother constantly brings rubbish (to which she is addicted) into her house. Eventually, Adina finds the path for a new life by meeting a woman called Erla Meier, who takes her to see cranes in a natural reserve. In 2006, Brauns published the detective novel Tag der Jagd.

Nike pays top athletes in many sports to use their products and promote and advertise their technology and design. Nike's first professional athlete endorser was Romanian tennis player Ilie NƒÉstase. The first track endorser was distance runner Steve Prefontaine. Prefontaine was the prized pupil of the company's co-founder, Bill Bowerman, while he coached at the University of Oregon. Today, the Steve Prefontaine Building is named in his honor at Nike's corporate headquarters. Nike has also sponsored many other successful track and field athletes over the years, such as Carl Lewis, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Sebastian Coe. The signing of basketball player Michael Jordan in 1984, with his subsequent promotion of Nike over the course of his career, with Spike Lee as Mars Blackmon, proved to be one of the biggest boosts to Nike's publicity and sales. Nike has been the official kit sponsor for the Indian cricket team since 2005. Nike is a major sponsor of the athletic programs at Penn State University and named its first child care facility after Joe Paterno when it opened in 1990 at the company's headquarters. Nike originally announced it would not remove Paterno's name from the building in the wake of the Penn State sex abuse scandal. After the Freeh Report was released on July 12, 2012, Nike CEO Mark Parker announced the name Joe Paterno would be removed immediately from the child development center. A new name has yet to be announced. Nike also sponsored soccer players such as Ronaldinho, Ronaldo, Cristiano Ronaldo, Didier Drogba, Neymar, Zlatan Ibrahimoviƒá, Wesley Sneijder, Wayne Rooney and Landon Donovan, among others. In January 2013, Nike signed Rory McIlroy, the then-number one golfer in the world, to a ten-year sponsorship deal worth $250 million. The deal includes using Nike's range of golf clubs, a move Nick Faldo previously described as \\"dangerous\\" for McIlroy's game. On February 21, 2013, Nike announced it suspended its contract with Oscar Pistorius, due to his being charged with premeditated murder.

Architecture and fittings Cloister Very little of the original Romanesque architecture remains. The 11th-12th century bell tower, reconstructed later, is the best preserved building. It is a slender tower, in height, and rectangular in shape. It consists of five floors with windows in the top four. The Gothic-style church, built between the 14th and 16th centuries, serves as parish church. It has a late Romanesque cloister which was partially destroyed in 1877. Annexed to the cloister is an ancient abbey house with large patio windows and Gothic arches. The tombs of the nobles who were buried in the monastery were desecrated and plundered; little remains of them. The adjoining church of Santa Maria is now a municipal museum.

He was involved in a series of complex and sharply contested property disputes with members of his own family. Arms of the Corbet baronets of Moreton Corbet: Or, a raven sableSir Bernard Burke, The general armory of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, p.228, Harrison, London, 1884, accessed 29 November 2013 at Internet Archive Canting arms from French corbeau, a raven Background Sir Andrew Corbet and an entirely new building on the Italian model begun next to it by his son, Robert. Roger Corbet was the third son of: :*Sir Robert Corbet (died 1375) of Moreton Corbet.Grazebrook and Rylands, p.134-5 The Corbets of Moreton Corbet were descended from the Corbet family of Caus Castle, who had been important landowners in the Welsh Marches from the time of William the Conqueror. The senior line of the Corbets at Caus had petered out in 1347 and the properties passed to Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of StaffordBaugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300‚Äì1540 The cadet branch made their home at Moreton Corbet Castle, then a significant stronghold in north Shropshire. :*Elizabeth, daughter of Fulk, 1st Baron Strange of Blackmere.Roskell et al, CORBET, Sir Roger (d.1395), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. ‚Äì Author: L. S. Woodger The Le Strange family were another important dynasty of Marcher Lords. Fulk le Strange was called to parliament by Edward II and served him as Seneschal of Gascony,Fulk Lestrange at the Gascon Rolls Project (1317‚Äì1478), accessed 4 December 2013 a key post in the administration of the remaining Plantagenet possessions in France. The title could be passed through both male and female, and in 1383 it passed via female descent and marriage to the Talbot family, later to become Earls of Shrewsbury. Roger Corbet had two older brothers, Thomas and Fulk, as well as a younger brother, John, and a sister, Joan. He inherited most of the family estates only because of a complex series of arrangements made by his parents. As the eldest son, Thomas, predeceased his parents, they were concerned to keep the estates in the Corbet family by preventing their going to Elizabeth, Thomas's daughter, who had married Sir John Ipstones,Grazebrook and Rylands, p.134 later twice MP for Staffordshire.Roskell et al, IPSTONES, Sir John (d.1394), of Blymhill, Staffs. ‚Äì Author: C.R. Hence they initiated a series of transactions, some involving their daughters, intended to put most of the estates in tail, and favouring in particular Fulk and Roger. However, some of the provisions were mutually-contradictory, generating the disputes Roger pursued in the 1380s and 1390s.Corbet, p.241 In fact, litigation began even before the death of Sir Robert. In 1374 Elizabeth and Ipstones went to the Court of Common Pleas to try to get possession of the manor of Braunstone in Leicestershire, which had been given to Thomas Erdington, the son of Roger's sister, Margaret. Landowner and litigant When Sir Robert died in 1375, most of the estates passed to his eldest remaining son, Sir Fulk. His widow held as jointure a number of properties: the double manor of Lawley, both parts of which had been Corbet property since the previous century;Baugh and Elrington (1985), Lawley: Manors and other estates Bletchley, where Elizabeth established a court leet;Baugh and Elrington (1985), Bradford Hundred and Hopton Wafers, in the south of Shropshire. When she died, in 1381, these passed to Roger. Sir Fulk himself died in 1382 and the entailed estates also passed to Roger: Shawbury, Moreton Corbet, Habberley, Rowton and three other Shropshire manors. The unentailed Corbet estates were to go to Fulk's daughter, another Elizabeth, who was still a minor. However, there were serious complications regarding four of the young Elizabeth's properties. Under a fine levied around 1363, Yockleton, Shelve, Wentnor and a fourth part of Caus Forest had been granted for life to Joan, Roger's sister, and her husband, Sir Robert de Harley. A year later, Joan and Harley had leased the properties to Sir Fulk for ¬£60 per annum for the remainder of their lives, acknowledging that they were held of the king by knight service. By a third fine, around 1368, they had provided for the estates to pass to Roger in the event of Fulk's death. The death of Fulk exposed the inherent contradiction: Joan was still alive, so Fulk's heir could claim the estates under the second fine. However, Fulk's death raised Roger's expectation of gaining control, under the terms of the third fine. Worse still, Fulk's widow, yet another Elizabeth, claimed the properties as part of her jointure. Roger went to the Court of Chancery to try to vindicate his position, supported by Joan and Harley. Richard II's lawyers argued that the properties should escheat to the Crown while the young Elizabeth was still a minor. In 1384, Richard II commissioned an inquisition by Robert Belknap and Robert Charleton, which seems to have decided for the escheat. Roger Corbet then took legal action to recover the estates and gained them in 1385. This was not the end, as Elizabeth attained the age of majority in 1390. She was now married to John Mawddwy or de la Pole, lord of Dinas Mawddwy, who raised the issue of the four estates again. Joan was now married to John Darras, and they took Corbet's side. As \\"strife and debate\\" was threatening to turn into something worse, the disputants were summoned on 23 June to appear in person before King and Council in Chancery, all being required to provide security for good behaviour in the very considerable sum of 200 marks each. After further delays, the disputed estates passed to the Mawddwys, and later to their daughter Elizabeth, who married Hugh Burgh, a future MP for Shropshire and Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. By the late 14th century Shropshire's landowners had almost entirely withdrawn from actual cultivation of the land.Baugh and Elrington (1989), Domesday Book: 1300‚Äì1540 ‚Äì The leasing of the demesnes Like most of their peers, the Corbets had rented out most of their demesne lands to tenants by the 1380s, under a variety of arrangements: tenancy at will, customary tenancies, sharecropping. The times were turbulent and uncertain and the Black death had made labour scarce, expensive, and hard to manage. Landed families were better off with a predictable income from rents than trying to exploit the land for themselves in the face of difficult conditions and volatile markets. Family tree The family tree illustrates the main lines of descent involved in the property conflicts of the late 14th century. Political and military career Apart from the property dispute with his own family, there were few occasions when Corbet's behaviour gave cause for concern to the authorities. In general he was accepted as a good guarantor of others' goodwill. In 1378 he and Sir Fulk stood surety for James Audley, 2nd Baron Audley, a Staffordshire magnate who took custody of Whittington Castle, seat of the Barons FitzWarin, during the minority of the 5th Baron, and he stood as guarantor for Sir Fulk when he took over the farm of a Fitzwarin manor. By 1382, he was married to Margaret Erdington ‚Äì part of a double link between the families, as his sister Margaret married his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Erdington.Roskell et al, ERDINGTON, Thomas (c.1371‚Äì1434), of Erdington, Warws.; Barrow upon Soar, Leics. and Corfe Mullen, Dorset. ‚Äì Author: L. S. Woodger However, while Sir Fulk lived, he was head of the family and Roger was a minor, if respected, figure in the county. However, Roger Corbet was made a Justice of the Peace within a year of his brother's death and in the same year, 1383, was elected twice to the House of Commons in the Parliaments of February and August. Probably in the same year, the abbots of Shrewsbury Abbey and Haughmond Abbey acted as godfathers to his first son, Robert. Corbet was made Commissioner of Array in 1385 and by 1388 he had been knighted. It is possible he served overseas in the interim. In 1391 he was again elected to Parliament. He was second to Sir Hugh Cheyne,Roskell et al, Shropshire ‚Äì Author: L. S.

Woodger Cheyne was probably an older and certainly a more experienced man: a veteran of war in Ireland and of at least six previous parliaments, and a supporter of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, whose family the Cheynes had long served. Death However, Corbet's time as head of the family was fairly short. He died in September 1395 and his widow, Margaret, died only two months later. The heir, Robert, was below the age of majority and in 1397 his marriage and wardship were granted to Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester.Corbet, p.243 However, Henry IV forced Worcester to relinquish the wardship to John Burley, a Shropshire MP and a retainer of Thomas FitzAlan, 12th Earl of Arundel.Roskell et al, CORBET, Robert (1383‚Äì1420), of Moreton Corbet, Salop. ‚Äì Author: L.

It was inaugurated in 1884 by Wilhelm I, Emperor of Germany. Through Avenue de la Libert√© (former Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra√üe), it faces the equally monumental former imperial palace (Kaiserpalast). The building served for several decades as the centre of the new imperial University of Strasbourg. The old university transferred from the buildings that it had occupied for centuries at the Jean Sturm Gymnasium to the new ones located in the Neustadt. Italianate features The architect, Otto Warth (1845‚Äì1918), from Karlsruhe, was young when he was entrusted with the design of the building. He had just returned from a one-year study visit to Italy, and his passion for Italian classical architecture is reflected in some of the Italianate features of the Palais. The Aula One of the most distinctive features of the building is the Aula, which measures 25 m by 29 m and 16 m high, which Warth modeled on the Villa Garzoni in Pontecasale, Candiana. It is decorated with a monumental seated statue of Ramses II, high, brought in 1933 by Pierre Montet.Statue de Rams√®s II on archi-strasbourg.org In 2012, the Aula was dedicated to Marc Bloch, former professor at the university, shot by the Nazis in 1944. Statuary The Palais is striking for the statuary of its fa√ßades, which pay hommage to a number of scientists, theologians, theoricians and thinkers with Germanic connections, thirty-six in all, including Luther, Leibniz, Calvin, Kepler, Kant, Spener, Lessing, Gauss. Two allegorical statues representing Germania (Germany) and Argentina (Strasbourg), the former removed in 1918 and the latter destroyed in 1945, were replaced in their respective niche on the fa√ßade in 2014, after having been restored and/or replicated based on photos. Monument historique On 21 May 1990, the hall, the Aula and the main stairways were classified as a monument historique.Palais Universitaire on the M√©rim√©e database of the French Ministry of Culture Council of Europe The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe held its first session in this building, from 8 August to 10 September 1949. University Press The Presses Universitaires de Strasbourg, reputedly the oldest university press in France, has had its headquarters in the building ever since it was founded in 1920. Gypsoth√®que The Palace's basement houses the Gypsoth√®que de Strasbourg, also known as Mus√©e des moulages (plaster cast museum). This classical cast collection was initiated with the founding of the Kaiser- Wilhelms-Universit√§t in 1872 by Adolf Michaelis, a distinguished classical scholar and art history pioneer. Next to casts of works like Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Apollo Belvedere, Aphrodite of Cnidus and the metopes of the Parthenon, the museum also displays casts of works by Antoine Bourdelle. The collection is the second largest cast collection in France and the largest university cast collection of France. The collections were moved into the Palace's basement in 1939, with the outbreak of World War II, and have stayed there since, although plans have periodically been made to move them into a separate building.Gypsoth√®que de Strasbourg , misha1.u-strasbg.fr ‚Ä¶sur la Gypsoth√®que de l‚ÄôUniversit√© de Strasbourg, collections.u-strasbg.fr Gallery Strasbourg Universit√© n106.JPGThe Palace's motto on top of the avant-corps Palais Universitaire de Strasbourg-Rams√®s II (2).jpgStatues of Ramses II in the Grand hall Universit√© de Strasbourg-Plaque WWII (1).jpgWorld War II commemorative plaque inside the Palace PalaisU-Strasbourg-Corniche (3).jpgFour of the statues of great learned men on the fa√ßade (to read the names, click on the picture) PalaisU-Strasbourg-Corniche (1).jpgFour others PalaisU-Strasbourg-Corniche (2).jpgThree others Mus√©e des moulages (4612867621).jpgInside the Gypsoth√®que below the Palace Mus√©e des moulages (4613491958).jpgInside the Gypsoth√®que below the Palace References External links Palais Universitaire on archi-strasbourg.org *Strasbourg University Press Education in Strasbourg Buildings and structures in Strasbourg Tourist attractions in Strasbourg Buildings and structures completed in 1884 Architecture of Germany Historicist architecture in France Plaster cast collections Monuments historiques of Bas-Rhin 1884 establishments in Germany ","title":"Palais Universitaire, Strasbourg"},{"id":"41217724","text":"London Bourne (1793‚Äì1869)London Bourne of Barbados, by Cecilia Karch \\"Slavery & Abolition: A Journal of Slave and Post-Slave Studies Volume 28, Issue 1, 2007\\" pages 23-40. was a former Barbadian slave who became a wealthy merchant and abolitionist.

The Anti-Slavery Examiner, Part 2 of 4  Business life  By the late 1820s, with stores and a sugar brokerage business, London Bourne was already considered one of the wealthiest merchants in Bridgetown. By 1837 London Bourne was known to have owned three stores in Bridgetown, and had a net worth of between twenty and thirty thousand dollars. His business included mercantile agents in England with a branch within the City of London employing English clerks.\\"Barbados: A History from the Amerindians to Independence\\" by F.A. Hoyos, Macmillan Education (January 1, 1978) The fact that a black man would have white employees was considered surprising at the time. Bourne also did some business giving loans to both black and white customers.\\"African Caribbeans: A Reference Guide\\" by Alan West (2003): Greenwood Publishing Group In 1841, in what appears to be his first move into landholding outside of Bridgetown, Bourne bought a 169-acre plantation in St. Michael for 7,428 pounds.\\"Economics of Emancipation: Jamaica and Barbados, 1823-1843\\" by Kathleen Mary Butler (May 1, 1995) \\"p. 116\\" University of North Carolina Press Bourne bought a second plantation in 1856. \\"Colored merchants of wealth were shut out of the merchants' exchange, though possessed of untarnished integrity, while white men were admitted as subscribers without regard to character.

Newton LSU Press, Jun 1, 2008 In 1840, Bourne was a member of the Barbados Auxiliary Anti-Slavery Society. He was also considered to be a strong and active supporter of Afro-Barbadian civil rights activist Samuel Jackman Prescod.  Personal life  London Bourne was married in 1822 to a free, property-owning black woman named Patience Graham with whom he had seven children.  Death  London Bourne died at the age of 76. Despite considerable business losses in the late 1850s, Bourne was still quite wealthy and had substantial property holdings at the time of his death.  Honors and public recognition  In 1997, after the demolition of Bourne's primary business address known as the Exchange building in order to create a low-income housing development, the development was subsequently named London Bourne Towers in his honor.

These milefortlets and intervening stone watchtowers extended from the western end of Hadrian's Wall, along the Cumbrian coast and were linked by a wooden palisade. They were contemporary with defensive structures on Hadrian's Wall. The site of Milefortlet 15 has been probably been destroyed by coastal erosion. A 3rd-century Roman cemetery, associated with a nearby fort at Beckfoot, was located in the area of the milefortlet. Description Milefortlet 15 was situated on the cliff between the villages of Beckfoot and Mawbray, in the civil parish of Holme St Cuthbert. It was located 350 metres south-west of Bibra Roman Fort at Beckfoot. The site of Milefortlet 15 is believed to have been destroyed by coastal erosion. An eastern rampart was identified and excavated in 1954 with no results, and the site had fully eroded by 1980. Roman cemetery A Roman cremation cemetery was located next to Milefortlet 15, and was associated with Bibra Roman Fort and its surrounding vicus. Finds associated with the cemetery include Samian ware pottery and a bronze disc brooch. An excavation was conducted in 2006 in which eight cremation burials were recorded, which were dated from pottery finds to the 3rd-century.  Associated Towers  Each milefortlet had two associated towers, similar in construction to the turrets built along Hadrian's Wall. These towers were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milefortlet, and would probably have been manned by part of the nearest Milefortlet's garrison. The towers associated with Milefortlet 15 are known as Tower 15A () and Tower 15B (). The site of Tower 15A is located on the summit of a high dune about 75 metres from the sea. Excavations were conducted in 1954 which revealed the eastern wall of a 6-metre square building. Fragments of pottery and other occupation debris were found.

The results of these discussions enabled the HPO Center to build a bridge between this scientific HPO study and its application in practice. The HPO Center was founded as a research and management consultancy center, based on the five factors with a direct correlation to competitive performance and that ensure that an organization is ‚Äì and remains ‚Äì an HPO (High Performance Organization). These characteristics were then used to develop the HPO diagnosis, which supports organizations to evaluate their current HPO status and indicates what they need to do in order to become an excellent organization. Since 2008, new scientific and practical research into High Performance Managers, High Performance Partnerships and High Performance Employees was started by the HPO Center. Research and consulting topics High Performance Organization (HPO) Over a period of five years (2003 ‚Äì 2007) 290 academic and management publications in the area of high performance and excellence were studied by dr. Andr√© A. de Waal, academic director of the HPO, in order to be able to build the HPO Framework. From these literature‚Äôs sources characteristics of high performance were distilled and put in an HPO Questionnaire which was distributed worldwide. Thousands of respondents from 1470 organizations in 50 countries filled in this questionnaire in which they indicated how their organization scored on these characteristics and performed against their peer groups. Subsequent statistical analysis of the collected data showed that there are 35 characteristics that have a direct positive relation with competitive performance. These characteristics always appear in five groups, the so-called HPO Factors (Quality of Management, Openness & Action Orientation, Long-Term Orientation, Continuous Improvement & Renewal and Quality of Employees). When an organization scores higher on these five HPO Factors than its peer group, than it performs financially and non- financially also better than the peer group. The HPO research was validated by Dr. Veronica Martinez of Cranfield University. Definition of an HPO According to dr. De Waal the definition of an HPO is: ‚ÄúA High Performance Organization is an organization that achieves financial and non-financial results that are exceedingly better than those of its peer group over a period of time of five years or more, by focusing in a disciplined way on that which really matters to the organization.‚Äù The contemporary high performance organization model acts as an alternative to the earlier model known as Taylorism, or scientific management, which mainly focuses on improving efficiency and productivity. High Performance Manager (HPM) The research into the characteristics of high performing managers (HPMs) is based on a sample of 808 Dutch managers and a sample in the UK consisted of employees of the ATLAS Consortium , a consortium of five ICT companies that were charged with improving the information and communication technology infrastructure of the British Ministry of Defence. Most of these employees were based in England, and using the cross-cultural framework of Excellent Leadership by Selvarajah et al., the profile of an excellent Dutch and British High Performance Manager was derived. This profile can be described by a five-dimensional factor structure consisting of: (1) Excellent Leadership; (2) Managerial Behaviors; (3) Environmental Influences; (4) Personal Qualities; and (5) Organizational Demands. The results of the research have significant practical implications in that organizations can use the profile to tailor their management development programs, evaluation and coaching programs, and recruiting processes. The above research showed that the framework for HPM is valid for both the Dutch and British context. The research results indicate that the five-factor structure is a sound representation of data, portraying reliable factors that are important to characterize Dutch and British HPMs. High Performance Partnership (HPP) The importance of partnerships to organizational success has increased considerably the past decennia and many organizations strive at creating high performance partnerships (HPPs). For this to happen, organizations in the partnerships have to be of high quality and their collaborations should be world-class. Whereas the factors that make up high performance organizations (HPO) are well established, the HPP factors are still unclear. This research develops a scale for measuring HPP factors. Based on empirical research at a cable company and its suppliers (a total of 239 filled-in questionnaires were received back, 46 from the cable company and on average 48 per supplier.), a HPP Framework was developed consisting of nine HPP characteristic: Control, Trust, Commitment, Coordination, Interdependence, Communication, Conflict, Valuing and Diversity. This framework is then tested at the ATLAS Consortium. The results of the application of the HPP framework in such a complicated environment are evaluated and the HPP framework is finalized. The research results show a strong relationship between HPP factors, HPO factors and the success factors of a partnership. This research adds to the literature by extending the concept of HPOs to the value chain these HPOs operate in. The practical benefit is that managers can use the HPP factors to increase their partnership quality.

Created by Mark Penn, the campaign sought primarily to attack a competing company, Google, by pointing out disadvantages and criticism of their products and services in comparison to those run by Microsoft (particularly, Bing and Outlook.com). The original campaign focused on Google Shopping's change to a pay per click model, with later campaigns focusing upon Google's use of user data for targeted advertising, and the capabilities of the Chrome OS platform in comparison to Windows. History Although Microsoft had attacked Google in its advertising before, the Scroogled campaign began in November 2012, attacking the Google Shopping service for its shift to a pay per click (PPC) model in which retailers are required to pay Google to have products listed, and are ranked in search results by their payments and relevance. The site suggested that users use Microsoft's competing Bing Shopping service instead, which had previously vowed not to shift to a PPC model. The next campaign in February 2013 incorporated elements of advocacy, attacking Gmail for using the contents of messages to generate targeted advertising, and recommending Outlook.com instead. The site also featured a survey of 1,000 users against the service's advertising practices, and a petition calling upon Google to stop engaging in the practice. In April 2013, Microsoft attacked Android, citing a recent allegation that Google Play Store had been, without disclosure, leaking basic personal information about users (including names, email addresses, and phone numbers) to application developers. In August 2013, alongside the launch of its Bing for Schools initiative, Microsoft argued that Google's use of advertising on search results pages in an educational environment could \\"distract [students] from their studies\\", unlike the ad-free version of Bing that can be enabled through the Bing for Schools program. In November 2013, Microsoft began to offer Scroogled merchandise through Microsoft Store, such as shirts and mugs featuring designs attacking Google's privacy practices. That same month, Microsoft also released a Scroogled ad starring Rick Harrison in parody of his television series Pawn Stars, which saw Harrison rejecting a Chromebook at his pawn shop due to its reliance on web-based software, as opposed to a \\"traditional\\" computer with Windows and Office.  Legacy  After terminating the Scroogled campaign, Microsoft redirected its website \\"scroogled.com\\" to \\"whymicrosoft.com\\", a website that argues that Microsoft's products are better than those of other companies. The website later was updated to redirect to microsoft.com/together, and later to microsoft.com/resilience.

The bank was established by 18 partners, mainly merchants, on 1 January 1793. Partners James Ker and Henry Johnston were joint managers. Sir Walter Scott is believed to have been an account holder. The former headquarters of the Leith Banking Company The headquarters of Leith Bank for the larger part of its existence was a two- storey building on Bernard Street, Leith, built in 1805-06. The bank grew during a time of prosperity for Leith during the early 19th century, following the development of the town's pier, harbour, docks and warehousing facilities. By 1827, it was one of five banking businesses operating in the town, the others being the Commercial Bank, the National Bank, the British Linen Bank and the Bank of Scotland. Beyond Leith, the bank also had branches in Callander, Dalkeith, Galashiels, Langholm and Carlisle, did business in Glasgow via an agent and operated from tents at sundry agricultural markets and fairs. Its agents in London were Barnett & Co. The office in Carlisle was, in fact, registered as an English bank and was therefore illegal, since English law forbade banks to have more than 6 partners. No attempts were made to prosecute the point though, until the branch closed of its own accord in 1837. Apart from a period in 1797 when it had to suspend cash payments, the bank initially prospered. However, with the economic crisis of 1837, the bank began to struggle. The following year, the Glasgow Union Bank offered them 5% on every ¬£100,000 of deposits transferred, terms which they declined. In 1842, with debts totalling ¬£123,582, including ¬£10,000 of notes in circulation, the Leith Banking Company failed. It was merged with another bank to become the Edinburgh and Leith Banking Company. This in turn was merged into the Clydesdale Bank. The bank's headquarters were taken over by the National Bank.

Soon after it was seen by British archaeologists, the statue was removed to London where it became part of the British Museum's collection. Although there is some debate about the age of the sculpture, in general, scholarly opinion dates it to the 2nd century BC. Since 2000, it has been prominently displayed on a plinth under the roof of the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court.British Museum Collection The Lion of Knidos, British Museum, retrieved 30 November 2013 Description Pullan's sketch of his conjectural reconstruction of the funerary monument as first built. It is estimated to be 18 metres high and faced in marble. The lion weighs 6 tons. This sculpture of a recumbent lion was quarried from Mount Pentelikon near Athens, the same marble used to build the Parthenon. The lion is substantially complete; only the lower jaw and front legs are missing; its eyes were probably once inlaid with glass. The statue is greater than life- size; it weighs six tonnes and measures 2.89 metres long and 1.82 metres high. In designing the body to be hollowed out from below, the weight of the statue was reduced. The statue stood on top of a funerary monument that is of a style fashionable in 350 BC in Halikarnassos, a centre that was only a day away by boat. The monument is square with a stepped pyramidal top. It was hollow on a circular plan. This similarity has led to some experts dating the statue to 350 BC, but others think that the statue was above a cenotaph made to commemorate the nearby naval Battle of Cnidus of 394 BC, in which the Athenian general, Conon, commanding a joint Athenian and Persian fleet, was victorious over a Spartan fleet led by Peisander.Knidos , Planetware.com, retrieved 2 December 2013 A third opinion is that the architecture of the monument is not typical of 250 BC, but is Doric and dates from 175 BC. This variation is summarised in the British Museum's estimate of 200-250 BC as its age.Colossal marble lion from a tomb monument, British Museum Highlights, retrieved 1 December 2013 The rest of the monument is still in Turkey where it has been excavated by the British Museum. It was originally 12 metres square. Excavations at the site, and similar monuments nearby, have failed to find an artefact or inscription that would more definitely date the statue. Discovery The Lion of Knidos was first seen in 1858 by the British archaeologist Richard Popplewell Pullan as he walked the cliffs near what is now the Turkish town of Dat√ßa. Three miles away Pullan was helping Charles Thomas Newton excavate the ancient Greek city of Knidos. The statue had crowned an 18-metre high funerary monument, which had commanding views over the sea and may have once acted as a navigation aid for passing sailors. The monument may have been destroyed in an earthquake, as the statue was found lying some distance from the tomb. The Knidos Lion was transported with some difficulty further down the coast, where it was loaded onto the naval ship HMS Supply by Robert Murdoch Smith and shipped to London. Smith's role was significant, as he was presented with a large statue that had fallen onto its front face. The limestone core of the monument was still there but the marble facing had either been stolen or lay around where it had fallen. Smith was able to replace and move each of the remaining stones which allowed Pullan, who was a trained architect, to sketch what is thought to be a good reproduction of what the whole structure would have looked like. In 2008 the Turkish town of Dat√ßa petitioned the British Ministry of Culture and Tourism for the return of the two statues known as the Lion of Knidos and the Demeter of Knidos.Turkey wants Knidos Lion to be returned, Elginism.com, retrieved 30 November 2013 References Further reading *Ian Jenkins, The Lion of Knidos, British Museum, 2008 *C.

Although according to Dr. Jos√© Policarpio Bantug in his book A Short History of Medicine in the Philippines During The Spanish Regime, 1565-1898 there were \\"no authentic monuments have come down to us that indicate with some certainty early medical practices\\" regarding the \\"beginnings of medicine in the Philippines\\" a historian from the United States named Edward Gaylord Borne described that the Philippines became \\"ahead of all the other European colonies\\" in providing healthcare to ill and invalid people during the start of the 17th century, a time period when the Philippines was a colony of Spain. From the 17th and 18th centuries, there had been a \\"state-of-the-art medical and pharmaceutical science\\" developed by Spanish friars based on Filipino curanderos (curandero being a Spanish term for a Filipino \\"folk therapist\\") that was \\"unique to the [Philippine] islands.\\" The Philippine shamans or babaylans were the first healers within the tribal communities of ancient Philippines. Later emerged folk doctors and the training and deployment of true medical practitioners as can be seen in the progression of Philippine history. At present, medical personnel trained based on Western medicine - such as Filipino nurses, physicians, physical therapists, pharmacists, surgeons among others - coexists with the still thriving group of traditional healers that do not have formal education in scientific medicine who often cater to people living in impoverished areas of the Philippines. Folk medicine There are ten categories of non-medical traditional healers or folk doctors in the Philippines: the babaylan (\\"religious leader\\"), albularyo, the manghihilot or hilot (the traditional \\"massage therapists\\"), the magpapaanak (the traditional \\"midwife\\", also sometimes called a hilot), the mangluluop, the manghihila, the mangtatawas, the mediko, the faith healer, the local shaman healers (such as those that are from the Cordilleras). Most folk healers in Philippines believe that their \\"medicinal\\" and healing skills come from a supernatural being or given to them by God. Their practice and methods of curing ailments involves superstitions, recitation of prayers and religious rituals accompanied by the mediation of the Holy Spirit, herbology, hydrotherapy, massage therapy, and divination. Although often found active in rural communities, traditional Filipino healers can also be found in small urban and suburban neighborhoods. During Spanish times in the Philippines, the Spaniards refer to folk doctors or traditional as mediquillos (\\"herbal scientists\\"), herbolarios, and sometimes as \\"superstitious quacks\\". They were even called by the Spaniards simply as matanda (the \\"elder\\"). Babaylan According to sociologist and anthropologist Marianita \\"Girlie\\" C. Villariba a babaylan is a woman mystic who is \\"a specialist in the fields of culture, religion, medicine and all kinds of theoretical knowledge about the phenomenon of nature.\\" In ancient Filipino society, the babaylans are believed to be a woman who had been possessed by a spirit, or a woman who had dreams or had encountered life- altering experiences, or a woman who has inherited the role to become a \\"mystical woman\\" from an elder babaylan. Their functions include the role of community leaders, warriors, community defenders, priestesses, healers, sages and seers. Although babaylans were mostly women, there were also male babaylans, which were men dressing up as women to be able to act the role of the female babaylan. Albularyo The albularyo (the \\"herbalist\\", herbolario in Spanish) is the \\"general practitioner\\" and the \\"primary dispenser of healthcare\\" in the hierarchy of traditional folk doctors in the Philippines. Because of the mass amount of different dialects spoken in the country, they have a diverse set of names depending on the region (suranho, sirkano, baylan, hapsalan, tambala, mananambal, etc.). He or she is knowledgeable in the use of medicinal herbs. The skill of the albularyo is commonly handed down from one generation to another in a family-line, involving apprenticeship. Abularyos are mostly the elders of the Barangays. The common folk diagnosis is that patients become sick due to supernatural \\"illness-causers\\" such as a duwende (dwarf), a nuno, a lamang-lupa (a \\"creature from the earth or underground or under the soil\\"), a tikbalang, or a kapre. He or she usually includes forms of prayers, such as bulong (\\"whispering\\" prayers) or orasyon (oration or \\"prayer recitation\\"), while treating patients. Albularyos may also practice rituals to drive away evil spirits, such as the performance of the kanyaw (cutting and bleeding chickens, then draining their blood on particular perimeters of the house), or the slaughter of pigs to search for the right type of liver that would reveal the cause of an illness. Sacrificial offerings are also sometimes used during treatments. Some albularyos choose to treat patients only on certain days of the week, such as Tuesdays and Fridays, or on the feast days of the Sto. Ni√±o and the Black Nazarene, with the belief that healing powers are greater during those days. The methods and practices used by albularyos vary per region. Mananambal In Cebu, located in the Visayas region of the Philippines, a traditional albularyo is called a Mananambal and their work of healing is called panambal. Like the general albularyo, mananambals obtain their status through ancestry, apprenticeship/observational practice, or through an epiphany and are generally performed by the elders of the community, regardless of gender. Their practice, or panambal, has a combination of elements from Christianity and sorcery which appear to be opposites since one involves faith healing while the other requires Black magic, Witchcraft, etc. The combinations are a reflection of the legacies left from the conversion to Catholicism of the islands from Spanish colonization, since the Indigenous of Cebu had direct contact with the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, and on-going Indigenous practices before colonization. The panambals cover natural and supernatural illnesses using a wide range of methods. Two common methods used are herbal medicine and orasyon, healing prayers deriving from a bible equivalency called the librito. Mananambals treat major and minor ailments. These ailments include but are not limited to: headache, fever, cold, toothache, dengue fever, wounds, Infection, cancer, intellectual impairment, and other illnesses thought to be caused by supernatural creatures. Aside from biological treatments, patients may also come to mananambals to form or break any form of relationships from marriage to friendships. Treatments are dependent on the type of sickness and on the mananambal themselves. Hilot The hilot may refer to either the manghihilot or the magpapaanak: The manghihilot (\\"massager\\", \\"folk massage therapist\\", \\"folk chiropractor\\") uses massaging techniques to treat sprains, fractures, and other similar conditions that affect the skeletal system and the musculatory system, including ligaments. The practice treats illnesses a variety of ways based on its own universal law and natural Law (physical manipulation, herbal remedies, and dietary/life style advice). Manghihilots are either chosen by maestros or master albularyos, or through apprenticeship. Gender is not a limiting factor since they can be any gender. When chosen, their trainings include a pilgrimage to a sacred mountain to perform the oracions, or words enabling the communication with the spirit world or the panawagan. Similar to the albularyo practice, the hilot is a fusion of spiritual and medicinal practices with physical manipulation and the focus of healing the whole body being the main distinctions between the two practices. Illnesses were referred to as pilay and were defined by imbalances in the body which are explained by their enkanto, or unseen entities, elements, and manifestations in the body. This practice shares similarities with India's Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine. The magpapaanak, the other \\"hilot\\", is the folk \\"midwife\\" who does prenatal visits and check-ups to pregnant mothers. Normally a woman, she delivers babies during childbirth and often performs the ritual called the suob (a form of \\"aroma therapy\\" performed while placed under a cloak). Mangluluop The mangluluop is a folk specialist who makes a diagnosis based on the resulting appearance of a burned concoction composed of freshwater shell or saltwater shell (kalanghuga), salt, a piece of palm leaves that were blessed by Catholic priests during Palm Sunday, and charcoal resulting from coconut shells, coconut midribs. The burning of these materials is done while placed inside a tin plate accompanied by prayers and invocations and the making of the sign of the cross three times over the body of the patient. Depending on the appearance and shape of the burned materials, mangluluop refers and sends the ill person to either the albularyo, the mediko, or the manghihilot for further treatment. After the ritual and after telling the patient to which folk doctor to go next, the freshwater or saltwater shell is powdered by the mangluluop and prayerfully applies the powder following the steps of how to make sign of the cross on the patient's forehead, palms, and plantar arches of the feet. The remainder of the concoction is then thrown under the stairs at the entrance of the home to prevent evil spirits from re-invading the house. Manghihila The manghihila (the \\"puller\\") uses the technique known as panghihila (the \\"pulling\\"), wherein the patient is rubbed with coconut oil accompanied by the use of a mirror, strips of cellophane paper that were used as wrappers of cigarette boxes, strips of banana frond, or wrappings of medicinal leaves. The type of \\"pull\\" felt during the massage therapy becomes the basis of what causes the ailment (i.e. the \\"smoothness\\" of the pull of the material used or the lingering or hovering or the strength of resistance of the applied material on a specific spot of the patient's body). Mangtatawas The mangtatawas (literally \\"user of tawas\\") determines the cause and nature of illnesses through the use of potassium alum, locally known in the Philippines as tawas as one of the primary ingredients. The other materials used in the diagnostic procedure are candles, eggs, mirrors, plain paper, and paper used for rolling cigarettes. Mediko The mediko is a folk doctor and a specialist that combines folk medicine and some techniques used in western medicine. He or she prescribes medications and at times uses acupuncture to treat ailments. Faith healer Filipino faith healers come from either spiritist groups, diviners (a group that practice divination) or from persons who were previously saved from illnesses or death and had encountered epiphanies or mystical experiences who became convinced that they were destined to help sick people after receiving healing powers bestowed upon them by the Holy Spirit or other supernatural beings. Some of them started as an albularyo, a mediko, or a hilot. Some faith healers are psychic healers (faith healers who heal patients remotely), whisperers of prayers (whispers prayers over the affected part of the body of the patient), prayer blowers (blows prayers on affected areas of the patient's body), anointers that rub saliva over the affected area of the patient, healers who hovers crucifixes and icons on the body of the patient, and psychic surgeons (folk surgeons who performs \\"surgery\\" on a patient without the use of surgical tools). Cordilleras shaman The shamans from the Philippine Cordilleras are folk healers that heal ailments based on the beliefs of people collectively known as the Igorots (includes tribes of the Bontok, Gaddang, Ibaloy, Ifugao, Ilongot, Isneg, Kalinga, Kankana-ey, Ikalahan, I'wak and Tinguian). Their culture believe in rituals that involve offering of prayers and sacrifial animals, belief in supreme deities or supreme beings, lesser ranked deities, intermediation by seers or human mediums, and pleasing and appeasing the anito (spirits of the dead, ancestral spirits, or spirits from nature) to prevent them from inducing diseases and misfortunes. They also cling to animism, ceremonies that are believed to cure physical and mental imbalances, those that counter witchcraft, and those that leads to bountiful harvests. Sacrifices, feasts and dances were performed as a form of thanksgiving and as entertainment for gods and goddesses. Other tribal healers dispenses magical amulets to use against illnesses and the pouring animal blood on the human body to avoid and escape death. Medicinal plants Years before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, the use of medicinal plants was the common way of treating ailments. Early Catholic missionaries such as Fr. Francisco Ignacio Alcina, SJ and Fray Jos√© de Valencia, and Fr. Pablo Clain, SJ were able to compile and publish books regarding these medicinal plants in the Philippines. Alcina and de Valencia published theirs in 1669, while Clain published his collection in 1712. The first qualities of plant medicines in the Philippines was first recorded by Fr. Blas de la Madre de Dios, OFM through his books Flora de Filipinas (Plants of the Philippines) and Tratado de Medicina Domestica (Treatise on Domestic Medicine). Early medicinal practices Cleaning cadavers were done by bathing and then rubbing the corpses with camphor oil. After cleansing, preservation of dead bodies were done through the introduction of buyo, a type of beetle and aloes via the mouth. Persons bitten by rabid dogs were treated by curanderos using the brain of a rabid dog. For 300 years, the efficacy of oil from monungal wood scrapings and pieces were used to fight cholera. Early Filipino used hydrotherapy by bathing in natural hot springs or sulphuric body of waters. Filipinos of Spanish times, particularly those in Los Ba√±os, Laguna, still bathe themselves even if sick. The placename Los Ba√±os is Spanish for \\"the places for bathing\\". To cure appendicitis, traditional Filipino healers during the Spanish period in the Philippines prescribed the intake of \\"water-treated fresh chicken gizzards\\" that would last for three consecutive Friday mornings. Medicine in Spanish Philippines (1600s to 1800s) During the 17th and 18th centuries, the number of medical supplies pouring into the Philippines was dependent on the yearly Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade, wherein medical supplies come mainly from Mexico (New Spain). Supplies had been routed from Europe to Mexico and then to the Philippines. In addition to this, the number of certified physicians, pharmacists, and surgeons trained in Europe were concentrated at the Cuerpo Sanidad Militar located in Manila. Because of this localization of medical personnel in Manila, religious Franciscan and Dominican missionaries acted as infirmarians, hospital founders, and the surveyors of herbal medicines at the localities where they were assigned. Common diseases Common disease during the Spanish period in the Philippines were diarrhea, dysentery, and leprosy. There were also the presence of cholera, influenza, smallpox, beri- beri, dysentery, bubonic plague, scurvy, rheumatism, asthma, syphilis, tetanus, toothache, and ulcers.

Pharmacies It was in 1830 when the \\"true pharmacies\\" were established in the Manila, Philippines. In 1871, a faculty of pharmacy was formally established at the University of Santo Tomas, and was later followed by the opening of \\"well-appointed drug stores\\". Hospitals Both the Spanish government and Spanish missionaries established a number of hospitals in the Philippines. The first hospital was erected by the Spaniards in Cebu during 1565. That first hospital was later transferred to Manila for the purpose of treating sick and wounded military personnel. The establishment of other health and charity institutions soon followed. The missionaries who established the early hospitals in the Philippines were the Franciscans, the Brotherhood of the Misericordia, the Brotherhood of San Juan de Dios, and the Dominicans. There were also lay government people who became founders of hospitals during the time period. Among the early hospitals in the Philippines were the following: =Manila= Manila had the Hospital Real de Espa√±oles (Royal Spanish Hospital, existed from 1577 to 1898), the Hospital de los Indios Naturales (Hospital of Native Indians, existed from 1578 to 1603), Hospital de Santa Ana (St. Anne Hospital, founded in 1603, still exists today), Hospital de la Misericordia (Mercy Hospital, existed from 1578 to 1656), the Hospital of San Juan de Dios (St. John of God Hospital, established in 1656, and still existing to the present), Hospital de San Lazaro (Hospital of St. Lazarus, a hospital for lepers established in 1603, still exists today), Hospital de San Pedro Martir (St. Peter the Martyr Hospital, 1587 to 1599), and the Hospital de San Gabriel (St. Gabriel Hospital, a hospital that is specialty for the Chinese community of Binondo, 1599 to 1774). =Cavite= In Cavite, the Hospital del Espiritu Santo (Holy Spirit Hospital) existed from 1591 to 1662. This hospital took care of sailors, marine personnel, shipbuilders, and carpenters among others. =Laguna= In Laguna, the Hospital de Nuestra Se√±ora de las Aguas Santas de Mainit (Our Lady of the Holy Waters Hospital in Mainit, Mainit being the name of a place with hot springs in Laguna) existed from 1597 to 1727 and then was re-established from 1877 and still existing up to the present. The hospital was built by Franciscan missionaries on top of the location of hot springs in Los Ba√±os, Laguna due to the therapeutic effects of the natural springs to the body of sick people, as they had observed from Filipinos of the time who bathe in hot springs despite of being ill. =Naga= In Naga, the Hospital de Santiago (St. James's Hospital) existed from 1611 to 1691. Another hospital also named as the Hospital de San Lazaro (Hospital of St. Lazarus), which is different from the one catering to leper patients in Manila, existed from 1873 and is still functioning today. Vaccination The Central Board of Vaccination was established in 1806. After 1883, caraballa calves as well horse, goat, deer, and monkey were used for producing vaccine. By the end of the Spanish regime in 1898, there were 122 vaccinators in different Philippine provinces in addition to so-called vacunadorcillas (vaccinators, or vaccine givers) assigned to each town. Asian medicines Drugs and medicines from China and from some regions of Southeast Asia were part of the medical trade during the Spanish period in the Philippines. A 1637 report of Don Juan Grau y Monfalcon attested the procurement of \\"valuable drugs\\" from a Cambodian king in 1600. A 1590 report of Bishop Domingo de Salazar, OP, confirmed the existence of shops with doctors and apothecaries managed by the Chinese in the Pari√°n of Spanish Manila. Obstetrics In Spanish Philippines, childbirth were managed by the traditional matrona (a type of comadrona or midwife), by the mediquillos, and by some parish priests. Childbearing manuals written during the period include Fr. Julian Bermejo's Instrucciones para las Parteras, a fin de evitar los abortos y que los ni√±os que mueran sin el bautismo (Instructions for Midwives to Prevent Abortion and Death of Unbaptised Babies) and Fr. Gregorio Sanz's Embologia Sagrada (Sacred Embryology). Bermejo's Instrucciones was the \\"earliest attempt\\" to manage fatal childbirthing complications. surgery The benefit of general surgical procedures was not available to common Filipinos during the Spanish era. Although Spanish surgeons were skillful in performing amputations and mutilations in the 1800s, their services were only available to by Spanish officials stationed in Manila. One such surgery was performed by Don Juan Ventura Sarra in 1675 on his patient Don Manuel de Leon to cure the latter's obesity and corpulence. The surgery involved removal of \\"lumps of lipids\\" from de Leon's abdominal cavities. Another recorded surgical treatment performed by Ventura Sarra was on a governor named Don Juan Vargas Hurtado in 1682, an operation that removed an abscess from Vargas Hurtado's hip. Medical literature During the Spanish period in the Philippines, Fr. Miguel Aganduru, a Recollect priest, published the Manual de Medicinas Caseras para Consuelo de los Pobres Indios (Medical Manual to Aid the Poor Indians). Aganduru wrote the medical manual to help ordinary Filipinos, with the assumption that such commoners could read the text of the book that was written in Spanish. Another type of such book that was intended to help ordinary Filipinos was of the Jesuit Fr. Paul Klein's 1708 Remedios faciles para diferentes infermedades por el P. Pablo Clain de la Compania de Jesus para el alivio, y Socorro de las PP. Ministros Evangelicos de las Doctrinas de los Naturales (Easy Remedies for Different Illnesses by Fr. Paul Klein, S.J. to Assist Ministers Evangelising the Natives). Other works include Dominican Fr. Fernando de Santa Maria's Manuel de Medicinas Caseras para Consuelo de las Pobres Indios en las Provincias y Pueblos donde no hay Medicina, ni Botica (Domestic Medicines to Aid the Poor Indians in the Provinces and Towns with neither Physicians nor Pharmacies, a work that he started from 1730 and was completed in 1786), Dominican Fr. Juan de Vergara's Tratado sobre medicinas caseras, Fr. Ignacio Mercado's Libro de Medicinas (Book of Medicines), Fr. Juan Biso's Tratado de Arboles y Hierbas de Indias (Treatise on Forests and Herbs of the Indians), Fr. Antonio Llanos' La Medicina Domestica (Domestic Medicine), Fr. Rodrigo de San Miguel's Manual de Medicina Domestica (Manual on Domestic Medicine), and Fr. Manuel Vilches' Manuel del Mediquillo Visaya (Manuel of the Visayan Traditional Healers). In art Philippine National Artist and painter Carlos \\"Botong\\" V. Francisco recorded and depicted the history of medicine in the Philippines by creating four mural-like four-panel oil paintings collectively titled The Progress of Medicine in the Philippines, which traced the practice of medicine from the times of the babaylans (\\"medicine men and women\\") up to a period in the modern-day era. The first painting depicts pre-colonial medicine, the second portrays medicine during the Spanish colonial period, the third describes medicine during the American occupation era, and the fourth the modern era of the 1950s. Each of the \\"panel paintings\\" measured 2.92 meters by 2.76 meters. The paintings were commissioned in 1953 to Francisco by four medical doctors, namely Dr. Agerico Sison, Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing, Dr. Florentino Herrera, Jr., and Dr. Constantino Manahan. Restorations of the historical paintings were done in 1974, 1991 and from 2006 to 2007. They were displayed at the lobby of the Philippine General Hospital for 58 years until their permanent relocation to the Museum Foundation of the Philippines Hall at the National Museum of the Philippines on July 27, 2011 because the paintings are now valued and was officially declared on September 21, 2011 as national treasures of the Philippines. The Philippine General Hospital now have on display only the reproductions of the original paintings, which were photographed by Benigno Toda III, a Filipino art expert.

Names of the library From its foundation until 1920 the library's official name was Volks‚∏óBibliothek No. I at first, since 1870s rather Volksbibliothek I (i.e. people's library No. I).

The foundation of public libraries in Berlin was promoted by Professor Friedrich von Raumer and others.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 5\\\\.

Returning from his 1841 journey through the United States the professor was deeply impressed by the broad knowledge of average US citizens, whom he had encountered travelling on a Mississippi steam boat. His travel acquaintances ascribed their interest and knowledge to their access to books from public libraries and public lectures on various subjects.Arend Buchholtz, Die Volksbibliotheken und Lesehallen der Stadt Berlin 1850‚Äì1900: Festschrift der Stadt Berlin zum 50j√§hrigen Bestehen der Volksbibliotheken, 1. August 1900, Berlin: Holten, 1900, pp. 10 and 19. Raumer then started an initiative to open public libraries in Berlin too. By the end of 1841 Raumer and other enthusiasts first founded the Verein f√ºr wissenschaftliche Vortr√§ge (i.e. Association for scientific public lectures). The Verein, using the Singing Academy concert hall as its venue for lectures, succeeded to collect Thaler 4,000 (then about ¬£ Sterling 592,59Frederic Scherer, Quarter notes and bank notes: The economics of music composition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2004, p. 210\\\\. .) forming the starting capital for Berlin's to-be- founded public libraries in 1846. Until the end of the 1870s the Verein raised and provided funds amounting to the sixfolds of this initial sum. The Verein, however, wanted the city of Berlin to give a helping hand and take the libraries under its auspices. Raumer presented his ideas on public libraries, termed as Volksbibliotheken (people's libraries), in a memorandum in 1846, resonating his democratic opinions. As a result, in 1847 Berlin's magistrate (city government) established a standing committee for the establishment and administration of public libraries, consisting of members of the afore- mentioned Verein and of the City Representatives' Assembly (Stadtverordnetenversammlung; then Berlin's city parliament).Frauke Mahrt- Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, pp. 5seq.

In December 1848 King Frederick William IV approved the foundation of public libraries, however, his decision remained unpublished due to the repercussions of the March Revolution of that year. The Prussian government added the clause that all works suited to endanger ethical life, religion or the state were strictly to be withheld from the library, while books apt to strengthen traditions, faith and the king's subjects' fidelity were to be preferentially acquired. Starting in 1849 , the city's archivist, served as responsible city official for the Library Commission, and soon determined its acquisitions of books.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 7\\\\.

Each was located in a gymnasium (grammar school) or other highschool of the city and run by its respective director or another appointed teacher. In the city centre, at ( Grammar School) on Werderscher Markt, Volks‚∏óBibliothek No. I was located, while Volks‚∏óBibliothek No. IV was situated in the Louisenst√§dtische h√∂here Stadtschule (Luisenstadt Higher City School) on Sebastianstra√üe 49, both libraries were then in what is Mitte since 1920. The first four libraries opened three times a week for an hour, all residents of Berlin were entitled to use them free of charge. Library users had to procure a certificate of bailment, by which a city or government official or another known citizen of Berlin committed himself to honour the user's eventual open obligations to the library. The certificates of bailment were to renewed every quarter. The starting stock of books, in all four libraries together, was 7,800 pieces. Many books were donated in kind, popular literature was mostly missing.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, pp. 6seq.

In 1851 the Library No. I with its primarily scientific scope had 149 registered users, whereas Library No. IV counted 281, the other two libraries made up for the remaining 851 registered users. The Library Commission elected Moritz F√ºrbringer its president in 1863. In the same year the Library No. IV moved into a new location on Ritterstra√üe 31, only to move again into Berlin's 47th and 7th municipal school (47. und 7.

In 1878 Fidicin retired. In the 1880s the development of the libraries stagnated. Budgets for new books were too short, as were the opening hours, librarian consulting was too poor and access too restricted. In 1886 in an article in the Zentralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen the Austrian professor shed light on the successful work of US American libraries, giving the central European library landscape a new push.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 9\\\\.

Organisations such as the Gesellschaft f√ºr die Verbreitung von Volksbildung (Society for spreading knowledge among the people; established in 1871), the Comenius-Gesellschaft (established in 1891), and the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Ethische Kultur (DGEK, German Society for Ethical Culture; established in 1892), confederated in order to promote better organised, more professionally run and better funded libraries, distinguishing themselves from the old-fashioned libraries by terming their institutions public reading or books halls (Lese- or B√ºcherhalle; the latter term remained namegiving for the charitable endowment holding Hamburg's public libraries). , Kiel, and Ernst Jeep, Berlin, became anchormen of the new movement. Berlin's 1890-appointed chief librarian, the Latvian Germanist and philosopher Arend Buchholtz (1857‚Äì1938, titled first Magistrate Librarian, then City Librarian as of 1894), supervising not only the magistrate's official library but all the public libraries of Berlin since 1892, adopted many ideas of the reform movement for the city's public libraries. They demanded that Berlin's libraries should also offer reading rooms.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 10\\\\.

Frustrated by this inactivity the DGEK raised funds for a private public library of the American type and on 1 January 1895 it opened the Erste √ñffentliche Lesehalle zu Berlin (first public reading hall) on Neue Sch√∂nhauser Stra√üe 13, in a rear wing of the Volkskaffee- und Speisehalle. The sensational success of this library, with 21,000 items circulated to the reading room in the first year, forced the magistrate's hand, co-financing the new library and finally granting the funds, which Buchholtz had demanded, in order to open the first reading rooms in Berlin's own public libraries. On 19 October 1896 the Library No. I moved to Mohrenstra√üe 41.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 182Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 11\\\\.

On 6 June 1901 the City Representatives' Assembly decided to found a central umbrella library and technical support unit, the Stadtbibliothek Berlin (Berlin City Library; since 1995 succeeded by the Berlin Central and Regional Library), with the libraries No. I and IV also being in its department. Now all books for the local libraries were centrally bought, eventually rebound, centrally catalogued and the catalogues regularly published in print.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 14\\\\.

The directives of the new central Stadtbibliothek Berlin, housed in the former Market Hall No. III on Zimmerstra√üe, provided for the standardised manning of all public libraries and, for the first time with Berlin's public libraries, allowed exceptionally women to be appointed as head officials of local public libraries. The background of this development was that (1864‚Äì1929), full-time head librarian at the Erste √ñffentliche Lesehalle and Germany's first woman librarian, had built up a network of women librarians in order to combine and represent their interests, and professionalise their work, forming a very effective trade union of women librarians, named Vereinigung bibliothekarisch arbeitender Frauen as of 1907 (Union of Women working as librarians). Then Peiser had become the head librarian and director of the library of the Kaufm√§nnischer Verband f√ºr weibliche Angestellte (Mercantile Federation for female Employees, another trade union), and she made both libraries under her auspices the first institutions for the professional education of women as librarians in Germany. So a number of well educated professional women were ready to work as full- time librarians. During the First World War the libraries No. I and IV, like all public libraries in Berlin, suffered from budget cutbacks, shortage of heating fuel and the like more.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 15\\\\.

In the same year the tasks of the Stadtbibliothek Berlin as the central unit for the public libraries on the territory of pre-1920 Berlin ended,On 7 September 1926 the City Representatives' Assembly decided to transfer the responsibility for the public libraries in the inner six borough from the Stadtbibliothek Berlin to the borough boards. however, it continued as Berlin's largest public library.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 156 Its affiliate libraries were reorganised into six units delineated along the boundaries of the six new boroughs covering Berlin's pre-1920 municipal territory.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 158 Thus the Library No. I, along with No. V (specialised on children), IX, XIV, XXII and XXIV, became part the umbrella unit Stadtb√ºcherei Kreuzberg (Kreuzberg city library), directed by (he; 1900‚Äì1991), who had started working with the network of public libraries under the Stadtbibliothek Berlin in 1923.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 18\\\\.

Between 1 July and 15 August 1933 the Library No. I, like all of Berlin's public libraries, remained shut in order to separate out all \\"undesired\\" media. The concerned books were then stored away in the stacks in the Neuer Marstall, since 1921 part of the premise of the Stadtbibliothek Berlin collections. As part of the Nazi employment policy the number of librarians in Kreuzberg's public libraries rose from 14 to 31, as generally with all the government workforce and bureaucracy. Stallschreiberstra√üe in ruins after the US air raid of 3 February 1945 After beginning of the Second World War the Library No. I had to close its children's reading room, 4.

Also the staff was reduced again from 31 to 12 by recruiting men for war and women for obligatory other labour. On 3 February 1945 the 47th and 7th school and the Library No. I were both heavily damaged in the US air raid on that fore- noon, most of the Luisenstadt neighbourhood had been bombed to ashes. The school, like many public buildings hosting ARP units, was saved from burning out completely, so that the Library No. I could at least rescue much of its holdings and other equipment. It moved into another location on Tempelhofer Ufer 15, in the neighbourhood. In summer 1945 the once forbidden books stored away since March 1933 in the premises of the Stadtbibliothek Berlin were handed over again to those 43 public libraries, out of a 106 as of 1939, which were at all able to resume operation. In September 1945 Georgy Zhukov ordered that all state-owned and private public libraries in Berlin have to hand in all literature of Nazi and militarist content.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 157. In March 1946 the recorded bookstock had halved and the staff reduced to a third as compared with 1939.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 26\\\\. No ISBN. In June 1946 the Allied Kommandatura confirmed Zhukov's order of September 1945. Otto Winzer, then head of the public education department in the Soviet-appointed new magistrate for all four Allied sectors of Berlin, ordered on 6 June 1946 all libraries to be closed in order to separate out all books of Nazi weltanschauung, of revanchist and monarchy-glorifying opinion.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 25\\\\. No ISBN. Winzer's department set up a specified black list of titles to be separated out. However, in the Library No. I, like all over the western sectors this black list circulated by the magistrate was not followed since it was considered as subsuming too many titles of other leaning as National Socialistic or militarist. All the remaining librarian staff was assessed as to their political leaning during the Nazi dictatorship. The head of the Library No. I, already in charge before the Nazi period, was assessed as being a bourgeois democrat, as were her fellow head colleagues in Kreuzberg. Thereafter the Library No. I reopened. New librarians were educated, working on three week days, and learning another three days in the new librarian school of Berlin. The replenishment of the bookstock, centrally directed by the department of public education then under communist auspices within the undivided magistrate, brought many Soviet glorifying and communist literature into the libraries.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 28\\\\. No ISBN. So after separating the city administrations into one for the eastern sector and another for the three western sectors in November and December 1948 the Library No. I, like all public libraries in West Berlin, came under the newly built up library department in West Berlin. The new western department urged another separating out of books, this time those considered being communist propaganda. The political division of Berlin caused many librarians working in East Berlin, often experienced and qualified, quitting their jobs and applying at libraries in the western sectors. This migration ended only in 1961, when the Berlin Wall inhibited it.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 162. As compared with librarians in the West of Germany this background of many librarians in West Berlin and the general experience of West Berliners with the communist rule in the East partially explains the reluctance with which books of communist authors, of socialist leaning (not to be confused with social democratic) East bloc provenance were acknowledged in the purchasing conferences held by the librarians.

In August 1951 the Library No. I moved into a location in the Verbandshaus der Deutschen Buchdrucker on Dudenstra√üe 10,Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 181 with the reading room only opened some months later.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 29\\\\. No ISBN. The bookstock had recovered in numbers, but it was widely antiquated, since due to lack of funds, many book donations of poor shape, quality and currentness had been integrated into the collection. In 1953 Alfred Kalisch (*1925) became head of the Library No. I. After in 1954 the new central public library for West Berlin, the America Memorial Library (Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek, AGB), financed through the McCloy Grant in memory of enduring the Berlin Blockade by the West Berliners and the western Allied forces involved, had opened its doors it attracted many Kreuzbergers who prior used to frequent one of the four smaller public libraries in the then borough of Kreuzberg. Part of the attractiveness of the AGB derived from it being an American-type open access library, whereas most of Berlin's other libraries held by then only small shares of their bookstock in open access, usually only the non-lending collection.An exception was the new Hugo-Heimann-B√ºcherei in Wedding, opened as an open access library in 1950. Cf. Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 158. So opening the AGB, again gave the Berlin libraries another push forwards in their development. On 31 March 1955, after years of campaigning, (1904‚Äì1979; head of Kreuzberg's public libraries from 1949 to 1969 and member of the House of Representatives of Berlin), succeeded in putting the Berliner B√ºchereigesetz (Berlin Library Act) through which provided for an expansion, better funding and improved equipment of West Berlin's public libraries through budgetary items earmarked for libraries. Building Dudenstra√üe 12‚Äì20, seen from southwest This new act also enabled constructing new library buildings in West Berlin, so that also the Library No. I could move into a newly built location, built from 1954 and 1955 and addressed as Dudenstra√üe 12‚Äì20 and Methfesselstra√üe 45‚Äì49.Gearbeitet, gewerkschaftet, gewohnt: 75 Jahre Verbandshaus der Deutschen Buchdrucker von Max Taut, Lothar Uebel (ed.) on behalf of the Industriegewerkschaft Medien, Druck und Papier, Publizistik und Kunst, Berlin: Industriegewerkschaft Medien, Druck und Papier, Publizistik und Kunst, 2000, p. 85\\\\. No ISBN. The library moved from Dudenstra√üe No. 10 to the neighbouring building with the entrance at No. 18‚Äì20. Hoffmann and Taut, who were the architects of the prior location as well as of the new one, had designed a modern building with bright rooms. So the Library No. I profited from the new act, which in the early 1960s was already de facto suspended by the House of Representatives when the earmarking of funds for libraries was skipped. After the library development plan, fixed under the Library Act, had expired in 1965, the public funding never recovered. View from outside into the children's department in the illuminated rotunda with its tholobate. On the occasion of its reopening the Library No. I was renamed as Friedrich von Raumer Library. The new premise was designed as an open access library right from the beginning. Also Kreuzberg's central public bookbindery moved from Zossener Stra√üe into the new building. The reading room was closed and converted into an open access library of juvenile literature in 1957. In the same year the bookbindery moved into the Kreuzberg borough hall on Yorckstra√üe 4‚Äì11. In 1969 Kalisch succeeded Dehms as head of Kreuzberg's public libraries.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 32\\\\.

Following the 1968 movement labour and the forms of collaboration among the librarians became less hierarchic, more collegial and broader as to the number of personnel included in decision taking.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 169. The informal new panels seized also tasks of other boards, so that in 1977 purchase conference ceased to meet, and all librarians are involved in the decision taking. These new forms of collaboration entailed a high identification of librarians with their work and library.Petra H√§tscher, \\"Das √ñffentliche Bibliothekswesen Berlins von 1961 bis 1989\\", in: Bibliothek: Forschung und Praxis, vol. 19 (1995), No. 2, pp. 155‚Äì188, here p. 170. Room in the ground floor of that part of the building addressed as Dudenstrasse #18 In 1987 the library was closed for some time due to a thorough overhaul. In 1988 the Raumer Library started lending CDs. In 1996 the SPD faction in the Kreuzberg borough assembly moved for assessing the possibility and the consequencies of closing the Raumer Library and the Bona Peiser Library.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 38\\\\.

The libraries remained, however, the Kreuzberg budget for book and media purchases was cut back from DM 400,000 to 210,000 in 1997. In late 2000 the Raumer Library became a part of the V√ñBB.Frauke Mahrt-Thomsen, 150 Jahre: Von den Berliner Volksbibliotheken zur Stadtbibliothek Kreuzberg; eine Chronik, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kunstamt Kreuzberg and Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Kreuzberg Museum and Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs (eds.), Berlin: Bezirksamt Kreuzberg von Berlin / Bibliotheksamt, 2000, p. 41\\\\.

The castle does not exist anymore and a lighthouse was built on the site in 1858.  Former Castle  Vesborg was initiated after the destruction of Brattingsborg Castle in the year 1289. The crown lacked a stronghold on this strategically important island and Vesborg was their remedy. It was built above 20 m tall coastal cliffs on a huge artificial hill and with a good view of the nearby sea and landscape. It gave a good view of the entrance to the straits of Lilleb√¶lt and Storeb√¶lt and large parts of the southern Kattegat sea. Few written sources mentions Vesborg, but in the wars around 1370, when Denmark faced the hostile coalition of Sweden, the Hanseatic states, the Duchy of Mecklenburg and the County of Holstein, the knight Henrik von der Osten, is mentioned as the kings Lord Lieutenant at Vesborg. After the Danish defeat, Vesborg lost its importance and was abandoned, perhaps even before it was finished. The castle was the largest of the five known medieval castles on the island of Sams√∏ and the castle hill is one of the largest in all of Denmark. Last remains of the former Vesborg castle Today almost all of Vesborg, has collapsed and tumbled into the sea below, the last part of the walls apparently fell under a storm on the Christmas Eve of 1875. The only remains, is a small part of the foundations of the gate tower, that would have guarded the drawbridge over the impressive moat, that was up to 10,5 m deep and 20 m wide and is particularly well preserved. The access road is located on the Eastern hill, it is 4 m wide, cobbled with small stones and shows no signs of wear. The site and surroundings was subject to an archaeological examination in 2009, as part of a larger project concerning all the known castle sites of Sams√∏. It was conducted as a very broad cooperation between the National Museum of Denmark, Moesg√•rd Museum, Ecomuseum Sams√∏ and the Cultural Heritage Agency. The name Vesborg literally means 'Ves'-Castle or 'Ves'-Fortress in English. In its earliest known written form 'Ves' was spelled Wes and is most likely derived from the Old Norse 'Veisa' or the dialect 'Vese', meaning a swampy place. The areas East, North and West of the castle hill are lowlying and have at some point during the castles foundation been rather swampy or wet.  The lighthouse  A lighthouse of 19 m, was erected on the site in 1858, named after the old castle. Because of the cliffs and the castle hill, it has a focal height of 36 m. On clear days it is possible to see Zealand, the head of Funen, parts of northern Funen, √Übel√∏, Endelave and the long coastline of Jutland. Vesborg Lighthouse have a powder magazine, previously used as storage facility for fog signals and nowadays hosting a small exhibition about the medieval castles of Sams√∏. The lighthouse belongs to Brattingsborg Manor and is the only lighthouse on the island.

History  Gunnergate Hall was built in 1857 for Charles Albert Leatham, a wealthy Quaker banker. Albert Leatham died in 1858 and in 1860 his widow sold Gunnergate Hall to ironmaster John Vaughan who used it as his residence. John Vaughan died in 1868 and his second son Thomas Vaughan inherited the hall and lived there. Thomas Vaughan spent extensively improving the hall, however his business failed and the hall was sold in 1881 to Carl Bolckow, nephew of Henry Bolckow. Carl Bolckow sold the hall to mayor and shipbuilder Sir Raylton Dixon in 1888. Sir Raylton Dixon died in 1901 and thereafter the hall was left unoccupied, and fell into disrepair. The hall was used as an army base in both world wars but was demolished in 1946 shortly after the Second World War, and the land acquired by Middlesbrough Council.  Description  Gunnergate Hall was located off Tollesby Lane and there is a plaque in the grounds that shows the former location of the hall. The main entrance drive was from Stokesley Road in Marton. Gunnergate Hall had three lodges but only two survive, Hunter‚Äôs Lodge on Gunnergate Lane and High Lodge on Tollesby Lane. The hall had a banqueting hall, ballroom and billiard room and the grounds had a rockery, tennis courts, greenhouses, waterfall, lake, fountain, and boat house. A water tower in the grounds may have supplied the lake fountain or else provided water pressure for the house.  Fairy Dell Park  Fairy Dell is a local nature reserve, and the former gardens and grounds of Gunnergate Hall. Fairy Dell is a laid out parkland and natural wooded beck valley with an ornamental lake and flood defence lakes that is part of the Marton West Beck wildlife corridor. The site was redeveloped as a flood defence in the late 1970s by Northumbrian Water and Middlesbrough Council. Access to the park can be gained from nearby Newham Grange Country Farm. Wildlife to be found include watervoles, herons, kingfishers, moorhens, and mallards. Numerous chainsaw sculptures have been created in the woodlands by Steve Iredale. Activities undertaken by the Friends of Fairy Dell interest group include path clearing, strimming, and planting. The park was given a Green Flag Award by the Civic Trust. Discoveries within in the area have included animal bones and a sunken path. An archaeological dig is planned for 2014 led by Tees Archaeology. A ¬£38,000 grant has been obtained from the Community Spaces Programme of the Heritage Lottery Fund for improving footpaths and natural woodland, flower planting, extra seating and the archaeological dig.

The 1916 Classical Revival building was designed by Joseph McArthur Vance, a prominent local architect, and is the best preserved of his works. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The Frank Howard Building occupies the eastern portion of a city block, facing Fenn, Federal and 1st Streets to the northeast of Pittsfield's central Park Square. It is a three-story timber-framed structure, its exterior clad in brick with limestone trim, resting on a granite foundation. The north facade faces Fenn Street, and has two commercial storefronts, each with plate glass display windows and recessed entrances. That on the right is slightly larger, and originally housed Frank Howard's hardware business. The upper floors of the street-facing facades are divided into pairs of bays, separated by brick pilasters. Sash windows are set in rectangular openings, with stone lintels, and stringcourses serving as sills beneath them on the third floor. The building is topped by a decorative parapet surrounding a flat roof. The block was built for Frank Howard, owner of a successful hardware and agricultural implements business, after Howard lost the lease on his existing storefront on North Street. The building was designed by Joseph McArthur Vance, a local architect who had designed other commercial buildings in downtown Pittsfield. The Howard building represents one of the best preserved of Vance's works. Frank Howard's sons continued to run the family business in the building until 1960, making only modest alterations to it. The building remained in the hands of his surviving son Arthur, after which it had a succession of owners. Portions of the building remained vacant throughout this time, and in 2010 it was sold to A.C. Enterprises, which is overseeing a historically sensitive conversion to mixed used.

Cullen and her brother were taken to the Koonibba Lutheran Mission Home near Ceduna, South Australia. She was educated at Concordia College and was their first female Aboriginal student. Nursing career After finishing her schooling, Cullen trained as a nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital. She worked in several hospitals across South Australia as well as for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. In 1964 Cullen moved to Port Augusta, South Australia to work at the hospital there. Cullen was horrified by the discrimination against Aboriginal people, particularly those living on the nearby missions. During this time Cullen married Lawrie Kinnear. The couple had three children. Career as an activist Cullen reconnected with her mother May Cobby, a Yankunjatjara woman, for the first time since she had been taken, after discovering that Cobby was living near Port Augusta. This emotional reunion was cut short by Cobby's disappearance in 1965 from Port Pirie. Cobby had been waiting at a roadhouse with her daughter Mabel, the only one of her four children not to be taken from her as a child. Staff at the roadhouse called the police, who came to ask May and Mabel to leave the roadhouse. Mabel was taken into custody by the police and May was left at the roadhouse, despite Mabel's protests. Cullen, who had been at work, later arrived to find that May had vanished. She demanded an inquest into May's disappearance, but no trace of her mother was found. Cullen later stated that her mother's disappearance pushed Cullen to become an activist for her people., quoted in She worked to improve access to healthcare in Aboriginal communities and became a prominent member of the Port Augusta Aboriginal community. She was involved in projects including the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program and also worked in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Cullen was elected to the Nulla Wanga Tjuta Regional Council, part of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC), in 1990. Two years later she moved to Canberra to take up a job as Health Policy Officer for ATSIC, later moving to the Office of Indigenous Affairs.

The Hercules Tree in the Mountain Home Grove of California is a living giant sequoia tree that has a room carved into the center of it. It is also known as the \\"Room Tree\\". History A wealthy rancher from Lindsay, California named Jesse Hoskins (1849-1908) in 1884 purchased an eighty-acre tract of giant sequoia trees in the southern Sierra Nevada from the United States government and named it Camp Lena. Hoskins, who spent his summers among the Camp Lena sequoias, chose biblical and classical themed names for the largest trees, and placed wooden name plates twenty feet off the ground on many of the better known ones. After spending several summers studying one giant tree that he named the Hercules Tree, he decided that he could carve out the center of it without damaging the tree, and with the help of a Mr. Meyers between 1897 and 1902 he drilled and hand cut a 12 feet (3.7 m) diameter by 9 feet (2.7 m) high room, to which he added a hinged wooden door. Hoskins tried living in this room, but it leaked sap, so he made it into a gift shop where he sold redwood trinkets made of wood left over from carving out the room. The Camp Lena tract remained in Hoskins's family until 1913, when it was sold. Although timber sales in 1956 resulted in some logging that was condemned by the Sierra Club, the Hercules Tree and various other large redwoods in the immediate vicinity were exempted. The Hercules Tree was protected for all time in 1977 when the Camp Lena tract was purchased by the State of California and incorporated into the Mountain Home State Demonstration Forest. A fire started by a cigarette butt on 4 September 1984 did cause some damage to the tree, and the door and Hoskin's name plate have since been stolen, but otherwise the tree is still standing, and the room can still be entered and enjoyed by all.

Adminfo Magazine, published by the BC Principals' & Vice-Principals' Association. October 2013.  Dynaread Program Development Criteria  The development criteria for Dynaread were aimed to address issues considered specific to older struggling readers. In particular, reduced progress under conventional phonics-based remediation, learned helplessness, and waning intrinsic motivation. Dynaread attempts to address these issues through language-based remediation, which delivers reading experiences in reader texts at par with an older child‚Äôs verbal vocabulary and language skills. As schools intrinsically move beyond a focus on learning to read past the initial grades, Dynaread believes that remediation requires high levels of self-efficacy: allowing students to do most of the remediation on their own.  Core Remediation Methodology  The Dynaread approach cashes in on the resident verbal language skills of the student: mapping orthography with the already present information in the child's verbal language realm. Dynaread sequentially builds a student lexical route vocabulary through extraction of each unique word from a series of lesson texts at par with the verbal language skills of these older children. Dynaread then use priming and memory-storage techniques from the field of cognitive neuroscience to accurately map the orthography of this word whilst coupling it with accurate pronunciation. In three short sessions, typically completed within two days, the student is subsequently presented the source text from which these words were extracted. Reading this text fluently, intrinsic motivation is recovered, whilst the lexical route storage is expanded with the necessary accurate context, semantics, and syntactical information. The curriculum consists of 195 lessons, grouped in 45 groups covering non-fictional subjects. A typical child requires 18 months to complete the curriculum.  Scientific Background  The core of Dynaread‚Äôs remediation approach is based on the ramifications of the Dual Route Cascaded Model of Visual Word Recognition and Reading Aloud (Coltheart, Max; Rastle, Kathleen;Perry, Conrad; Langdon, Robyn; Ziegler, Johannes. Psychological Review, Vol 108(1), Jan 2001, 204-256.).Dual Route Cascaded Model of Visual Word Recognition and Reading Aloud .

The song became known for what at the time were considered suggestive lyrics, and then for a series of lawsuits over songwriter royalties.  History  Bechet recorded the song in his first recording session as bandleader with Ware and \\"The Two Fishmongers\\" as vocalists - uncredited but later identified as Willie Spottswood and Eddie Robinson. At the same time two white dancers, Jerry Brandow and Lenny Kent, had approached the Andrews Sisters' manager Lou Levy with the song, claiming it was a traditional jazz tune, and five days after Bechet's recording, the Andrews Sisters recorded the song - with cleaner lyrics and a modified introduction, as \\"Hold Tight-Hold Tight (Want Some Sea Food Mama),\\" with Jimmy Dorsey's band. Their recording was a considerable hit, followed by another notable version by Fats Waller a few months later in January 1939. Waller's gravelly voice and the double entendre lyrics contributed to the song's success. Although the song had been played around jazz clubs for years, the Andrews Sisters hit provoked the first royalty cases - the royalties being awarded to the two dancers who had \\"discovered\\" the song, Brandow and Kent, then to Bechet's recording session team: guitarist Leonard Ware and singers Eddie Robinson, and Willie Spottswood. Other claims for parts of the song were made by Sy Oliver, Count Basie, Gene Krupa, the singer Jerry Kruger, and trumpeter Taps Miller. However, Sidney Bechet continued to claim the lyrics, which he argued had been written back in 1924, but that pianist Clarence Williams had decided not to publish and register the lyrics as they were then considered too suggestive. Eventually the two dancers Brandow and Kent were removed from the song's copyright, and the Catalog of Copyright Entries of the Library of Congress Copyright Office (1968) lists the copyright for \\"Hold Tight, Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)\\" as only \\"Leonard W.

By then he had already been on trial at Liverpool and subsequently also spent time at Burnley and Birmingham City, but no offer from England materialised after Ayr requested a development fee from interested clubs. At the start of the 2012‚Äì13 season, Shankland broke another record held by Kean, becoming the youngest goalscorer at 17 years and 17 days old, in a 3‚Äì1 away defeat at East Stirlingshire in the Challenge Cup.

Eerdmans Publishing, 2004, , , 854 pages, entry on Christian Standard, pages 197-199. The Standard began focusing on a particular branch of the movement, the Christian churches and churches of Christ, in second half of the 20th century and became the most influential of the movement publications among those churches. History The Standard was founded in Cleveland, Ohio by W.S. Streator, W.J. Ford, J.P. Robinson, T.W. Phillips, C.M. Phillips, G.W.M. Yost, James A. Garfield and Isaac Errett, with Errett serving as the editor. The effort was not financially successful, and after two years Errett agreed to take over the venture along with its debts. It was the flagship of Standard Publishing. Under the leadership of Errett, who became the first president of the Foreign Christian Missionary Society, the Standard strongly supported the cause of missionary societies. During the early 20th century the Standard took an editorial stance against modernism and liberalism, and opposed the acceptance of \\"open membership\\" by the United Christian Missionary Society (UCMS). As the century progressed, the Standard focused solely on the Christian churches and churches of Christ and became the most influential of the movement publications among that branch of the Restoration Movement. Towards the end of the 20th century competition from other forms of media and \\"the increasing secularization of the culture\\" has reduced the relative influence of the Standard. In 2015, Standard Publishing's parent company New Mountain Learning sold its Bible lesson commentary series, Sunday school curriculum and other church resources to David C. Cook.

Brothers David and Andrew Fyfe Taylor, and George Thompson Clarkson founded the newspaper in the nearby port of Wallaroo in 1865. The newspapers mainly focused on reporting the happenings in these two towns and nearby Moonta. Editorial opinion was generally politically conservative and supportive of free trade. It opposed miners' strikes and in particular opposed to Premier Charles Kingston. Some early editions of the paper contained articles written in Welsh. \\"In 1870 South Australian Parliament debated the newspaper's 'contempt of this House.'

It serves as the dividing line between North Portland and South Portland. Its namesake bridge, Burnside Bridge, is one of the most heavily traversed in Portland. In Gresham between approximately the east 18300 block to Mt. Hood Hwy (and E Powell Blvd/SE Powell Valley Rd), Burnside runs southeast‚Äìnorthwest and is no longer the divide between northeast and southeast on the City of Portland-Multnomah County street grid. Additionally (as you travel southeast), SE Burnside St becomes NW Burnside Road at SE 202nd/NW Birdsdale Ave, and NE Burnside Rd at N Main Ave in Gresham. Burnside Road's eastern terminus is where it meets Mt. Hood Hwy (US-26), E Powell Blvd (US-26), and SE Powell Valley Road. History Powell's City of Books What is now Burnside Street was originally named B Street east of Southwest 16th Avenue and Washington Street west of S.W. 16th (as a continuation of Washington Street from downtown). In 1891, B Street was renamed for Portland merchant David Burnside, and in 1933 Washington Street west of SW 16th was renamed Burnside Street. Burnside became Portland's principal east‚Äìwest axis following the 1912 Bennett Plan, soon becoming one of the widest streets in the city. The street runs from SW Barnes Road in Sylvan- Highlands to the Mount Hood Highway in Gresham, a distance of over . It crosses the Willamette River via the Burnside Bridge, where the White Stag sign is visible. For a number of years, the portion of Burnside between NW 19th Avenue and NE Sandy Boulevard was designated U.S. Route 30.

The 21st named storm of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Fitow developed on September 29 to the east of the Philippines. It initially tracked north-northwestward, gradually intensifying into a tropical storm and later to typhoon status, or with winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph). Fitow later turned more to the west- northwest due to an intensifying ridge to the east, bringing the typhoon over the Ryukyu Islands with peak winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) on October 5\\\\. The next day, the typhoon struck China at Fuding in Fujian province. Fitow quickly weakened over land, dissipating on October 7\\\\. Across its path, Fitow spurred many airlines to cancel flights and caused other transport disruptions. In Japan, the typhoon damaged 1,464 houses and left about 6,800 households without power on Miyako-jima. Heavy rainfall in Taiwan flooded houses and caused mudslides that closed two highways. Damage was heaviest in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces in China near where Fitow struck. In the latter province, rainfall peaked at in Yuyao, which flooded 70% of the town with up to of waters; as a result, the floods were the worst in a century for Yuyao, which disrupted aid distribution in the storm's aftermath. Across China, Fitow damaged about 95,000 houses and left at least 159,000 other houses without power. The storm also flooded about 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) of fields and killed thousands of fish at fish farms. Total damage in the country reached ¬•63.14 billion (2013 RMB, $10.4 billion USD), of which ¬•6 billion (RMB, US$1 billion) was from insured losses, the second-costliest event on record. There were also 12 deaths in China, eight of them related to electrocutions. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Fitow were from a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, about 310 kilometres (195 miles) north-northeast of Palau, an island in the western Pacific Ocean during mid-late September. At the time, wind shear dislocated the convection to the west of a broad and poorly-defined circulation. Although the system was poorly organized, tropical cyclone forecast models noted the potential for development to occur. The convection gradually consolidated and outflow increased to the west, indicative of increased organization. Early on September 29, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared that a tropical depression formed about to the northeast of Palau. Around the same time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing warnings on the depression, giving it the local name Quedan. Early on September 30, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 22W, noting that the circulation had become increasingly well-defined amid decreasing wind shear. With a ridge to the east, the system tracked to the north-northwest through an area of warm water temperatures. At 1200 UTC on September 30, the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fitow. Although outflow and convection increased in general, the thunderstorm activity diminished over the center due to sinking air. By late on October 1, however, convection increased over Fitow's center, and the next day the JMA upgraded it to a severe tropical storm. On October 2, an eye began developing on satellite imagery, although the rainbands wrapping into the eye were fragmented. It took until midday on October 3 for the JTWC to upgrade Fitow to typhoon status, with 1-minute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). By that time, the convection had increased in coverage and intensity, with outflow increased by a trough to the north. The JMA did not follow suit until 1200 UTC on October 4, by which time the eye had become better defined. Danas (right) existing simultaneously on October 6 After officially becoming a typhoon, Fitow turned more to the northwest due to the ridge building to the east. Despite increasing wind shear, the typhoon continued to intensify due to amplified outflow. Late on October 4, the JMA upgraded Fitow to peak 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). Early the next day, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), and shortly thereafter the typhoon passed about 225 km (140 mph) south of Okinawa. By that time, the eye had expanded to 75 km (45 mi), which initially remained unaffected by the increased wind shear. Also on October 5, PAGASA issued the final advisory as the storm exited the agency's area of responsibility. Around 1500 UTC on October 5, Fitow passed about 40 km (65 mi) north of Miyako-jima, by which time the eye began deteriorating. As the typhoon passed northeast of Taiwan, the ragged eye became cloud-filled and the convection weakened. Late on October 6, Fitow made landfall just south of Wenzhou in eastern China, at Fuding in Fujian province. Fitow became the strongest China typhoon landfall for the month since 1949 according to the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), with a landfall pressure of and sustained winds of 151 km/h (94 mph). While continuing northwestward near the border of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces, Fitow rapidly weakened, dissipating on October 7. Preparations Taiwan High Speed Rail warning issued ahead of the storm On the Japanese island of Okinawa, 288 flights at Naha Airport were canceled, affecting 28,000 people. Officials also canceled bus, monorail, and ferry services. In South Korea, workers involved with the 2013 Formula One season issued a typhoon alert and began planning contingencies in the event Fitow affected the Korean Grand Prix. Officials in Taiwan issued a storm warning before Fitow passed north of the island. The Taiwan military activated 20,000 troops to protect and be on standby. Seventeen ferry services between Taiwan and the offshore islands were terminated, and over 200 flights were canceled. Schools and government offices closed in portions of Taiwan due to the storm. Ahead of the storm, officials in China issued warnings for Zhejiang and Fujian for the potential of high winds and flooding, which was later credited for reducing casualties. The Chinese army was utilized to assist in mitigating against potential flooding. Officials told boat owners to put their property in shelter, totaling 65,000 vessels ordered to return to report. Coastal facilities such as seaside bathing centers were closed. Before Fitow struck China, 177,000 people evacuated in Fujian and a further 574,000 evacuated their houses in Zhejiang, totaling 751,000 people. In Shanghai, 42 train or bus rides were canceled, along with 40 canceled flights. Two airports in Zhejiang had 49 canceled flights, with another 20 canceled in Fujian. Impact In Japan, Fitow produced peak wind gusts of 133 km/h (83 mph) on Miyako-jima, where about 6,800 homes lost power. Winds gusted to 193 km/h (120 mph) on Yoronjima to the north of Okinawa, while 167 km/h (104 mph) gusts were recorded at Kunigami on the northern tip of Okinawa. In Okinawa, the typhoon caused power outages, disrupted transportation, and damaged farms. In Japan, Fitow damaged 1,464 homes and injured five people. While passing north of Taiwan, Fitow dropped heavy rainfall reaching at a station in Hsinchu County. In the county, the rains forced 224 people to evacuate their houses. Mudslides and the threat for flooding spurred officials to close portions of two provincial highways. The typhoon also produced strong winds that caused power outages for 6,900 people. China Throughout eastern China, the high winds and rains knocked down trees and ruined local shrimp and seaweed farms, and overall 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) of crops were flooded, including in Wenzhou. Widespread areas were flooded, forcing residents to travel by boats. Fitow damaged or destroyed about 95,000 houses. The typhoon killed 12 people in the country, and left ¬•63.1 billion in damage (2013 RMB, $10.4 billion USD). Insured losses from Fitow totaled ¬•6 billion (RMB, US$1 billion), the second costliest event on record for China. As Fitow made landfall in mainland China, it produced wind gusts of 274 km/h (170 mph) in the Shiping Mountains of Zhejiang, setting a record for the province. The typhoon spread heavy rainfall across eastern China in the Jiangnan region, in conjunction with a plume of cold air. An area wide received of precipitation, while an area of wide received over of rainfall. Yuyao in Zhejiang reported a peak rainfall total of , a record for the city, while Ningbo reported a daily average of over three days, setting a record. A station in Shanghai reported , the highest daily rainfall total since 1961. The rains increased levels along 17 rivers, rising from , and Lake Tai rose by . The Yaojiang River, a tributary of the Yongjiang river, reached its highest levels on record, reaching a height of in Yuyao. Across eastern China, Fitow left heavy damage due to strong winds, heavy rainfall, and a powerful storm surge. Floodwaters covered about 70% of the metropolis of Yuyao, reaching in some areas, which cut off power and water supply. The floods were the worst in a century for the city, covering most roadways, and forcing most schools, health facilities, and factories to close. In the city, about 100,000 people were forced to evacuate, with 289 temporary shelters opened. Damage in the city alone totaled about ¬•20 billion (RMB, US$3.27 billion). In Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang, Fitow wrecked 26,180 houses and damaged local fish farms, killing 51,000 tons of fish. The storm forced 18,134 factories to shut down, and there were also power and telecommunication outages. In Shanghai, high waters along the Huangpu River damaged a portion of a flood prevention wall. Rainfall caused several matches to be canceled at the 2013 Shanghai Masters. Flooding closed the city zoo and 60 parks, and entered 600 houses. In Cangnan County in Wenzhou, Fitow wrecked 1,200 houses, and throughout Wenzhou, two people died - one after being blown off a hill, and the other trapped under collapsed rubble. High winds left 254,746 people in Zhejiang without power, and eight people died in the province from electrocutions. Another two people died after driving into a flooded river. Throughout China, Fitow damaged or destroyed 95,000 houses. Aftermath In Zhejiang, about 10,000 utility men worked to restore the widespread power outages. In the days following the storm, about 1.24 million people were forced to stay in shelters due to damage. A total of 11,732 soldiers or militia members assisted in helping in the storm's aftermath. Many cleared mudslides from roads, repaired dams, and helped people leave flooded homes. In Tongxiang in Zhejiang province, thousands of people blocked a highway in protest for not receiving aid, prompting the riot police to break up the gathering. The town did not receive supplies other than water tanks, due to it being designated a \\"self-rescuing area\\" according to a local official. Ping An Insurance received insurance claims for 11,348 flooded cars in the days after the storm. The storm caused slight delays to shipping in Ningbo and Shanghai. The Chinese Ministry of Finance and Civil Affairs allocated ¬•118 million (US$19.3 million) in funding for Zhejiang and Fujian provinces after the storm. In general, local governments assisted the affected storm victims by providing food, water, and clothing, even traveling by canoe to distribute aid. However, residents in Yuyao complained about insufficient assistance, as many people were without food or clean water for several days, due to ongoing flooding making distribution difficult. This sparked thousands of people to protest the government, although they dispersed after increased numbers of policemen. Residents were initially required to show food coupons to receive meals, but later anyone with a residence permit could receive the meals; however, the food distribution was disorganized, and there were reports of people looting for food. By October 18, the flooding in Yuyao had subsided and roadways had reopened, and power service was gradually restored. Due to the extended disruptions to the city, garbage service was halted. Two people in Yuyao were arrested after spreading false rumors online that reservoir collapsed during the storm, killing 40 people. Retirement During their 2014 annual session, the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee announced that the name Fitow would be retired from the naming lists. The name Mun was chosen to replace Fitow.

The park contains 10 modern and abstract sculptures by famous Colombian and international artists such as Edgar Negret (Colombia), Otto Herbert Hajek (Germany), and Sergio de Camargo (Brazil). Its closest metro station is Industriales. The park is free to the public and is open from 6 am to midnight. History Sculpture Park was created in 1983 on the initiative of former Colombian President Belisario Betancur Cuartas, who wanted to turn the area into an important cultural center. In a record time of 15 days in December 1983, invited artists gave life to one of the most ambitious cultural projects in the city. The Museum of Modern Art of Medellin coordinated the installation of a permanent display of sculptures made by 10 national and international artists to be installed in the natural environment of the hill. The park includes works by Sergio Camargo (Brasil), Carlos Cruz D√≠ez (Venezuela), Manuel Falguerez (Mexico), Otto Herbert Hajek (Germany), Julio Le Parc (Argentina), √âdgar Negret (Colombia), John Castles (Colombia), Ronny Vayda (Colombia) and Alberto Uribe (Colombia). Cacique Nutibara Sculpture The first monumental sculpture that was made especially to decorate Nutibara was the Madremonte, by Jos√© Horacio Betancur in 1953. Since its delivery, Madremonte was exposed early in the House of Culture, and then the Nutibara hill, until March 27, 1986, when it was moved to the Botanical Garden of Medell√≠n in exchange for sculpture Cacique Nutibara, also by Betancur. This sculpture, made in the year 1955, is patinated concrete, weighs four tons and is 3 m high by 2.9 m wide. Before being located on the western side of the top of the hill, the Cacique Nutibara was exhibited at the Plaza that bears his name, then in the garden art of Laureles. In 1963 it was transferred first to Cerro Nutibara, where it remained until 1970, when it was taken to the Botanical Garden, where he remained until March 27, 1986, and then returned definitively to Nutibara hill.

Each of the chosen schools selects up to 30 students from years 9-13 to participate; this can be a pre-existing or new group. These 1,200 students are given the opportunity to take part in four exclusive pre-show workshops during the year before attending every production in The Old Vic season. The workshops are delivered by carefully trained professional theatre facilitators and prepare the students for each play by exploring the characters, plot and themes, as well as developing confidence and interpersonal skills. Schools also receive a Teachers‚Äô Pack; teacher training sessions throughout the year and backstage tours.

With music, movement and bicycles, Rise will explore the impact of living in a city where the temperature is rising.  Ages (2015)  Ages was the second production from The Old Vic Community Company. The specially commissioned play with cutting-edge scientific views and a platform for opinion will start a debate about what it means to grow up and grow old in the city. Inspired by testimonies of real Londoners, Ages will feature music, movement and drama. Ages played to hundreds of people at The Old Vic Workrooms in May 2015.  Housed (2014)  From estate agents to squatters, from support workers to oligarchs, we are all united in a race to get a place. But who can afford to go the distance?

Housed played to packed houses at The Old Vic and Hotel Elephant in July 2014.  Previous Productions   Epidemic (2012)  In 2012 Old Vic New Voices produced the community musical Epidemic at The Old Vic Tunnels (29). The production focused on the public health issues of obesity and mental health and was backed by the Wellcome Trust. Written by Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, the production was the culmination of 18 months of research including one-on- one interviews, group workshops, creative writing sessions, and community events. It focused on the character of Marlon, who needs help from a system he doesn't trust and runs away to find answers; the musical featured 10 new songs. Epidemic won an Arts and Health Award from the Royal Society for Public Health in recognition of ‚Äúinnovative theatre work highlighting the major public health challenges of mental illness and obesity‚Äù.  Platform (2010)  Platform was a promenade piece staged for a week at The Old Vic Tunnels that looked at what it meant to be a Londoner in 2010. The show featured a largely non-professional cast and crew of 120 people, ranging in age from 17 to 75 from diverse backgrounds and professions, including students, city workers, former drug addicts and a 74-year-old former hospital social worker. The script for Platform was created from 200 hours of interviews by writers Duncan Macmillan and Morgan Lloyd Malcolm, themselves part of OVNV's emerging talent programme. The British Theatre Guide said: ‚ÄúPlatform is truly inventive and its affection and passion for London and her people unmistakably shine through\\". The Evening Standard described the project as ‚Äúa striking testament to [The Old Vic‚Äôs] imperviousness to arts cuts. Kevin Spacey said of the project: \\"I'm delighted we're doing our third community show and have managed to pull off something as remarkable and crazily ambitious as a 120-strong acting company. The show pulls all these stories of different Londoners together. And what's really pleasing is that it's so positive and upbeat about the city\\".  Branded (2008)  OVNV‚Äôs second community production, Branded, was written by Simon Bent, and staged at The Old Vic from 1‚Äì3 May 2008, for five performances, all free of charge. The piece, commissioned as part of OVNV‚Äôs Go for Green outreach and community project, featured a cast and crew of 50, aged from 16 to 60, selected through a series of London-wide open auditions. The play used a diverse selection of skills including; free- running, poetry, dance and physical theatre, to tell the story of the launch of an environmentally-friendly range of training shoes. Funders of the programme included Adventure Ecology, HSBC and the Hunter Foundation.  Somme Theatre (2006)  OVNV‚Äôs first community production, Somme Theatre, was a collaboration with the Imperial War Museum which saw a cast of locals perform a play, On the Middle Day, about the Battle of the Somme. The play was staged to mark the 90th anniversary of the battle in which the British Army lost 58,000 troops, and included a cameo appearance by the Old Vic‚Äôs artistic director Kevin Spacey as the voice of King George V. Somme Theatre was funded by a ¬£46,100 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The project was named the UK‚Äôs favourite Lottery-funded heritage project at The National Lottery Awards in 2007; the awards were chosen by the public.

Telecoms industry analyst Dean Bubley first used the term in a report on Telco-OTT in February 2012. Traditionally, most telecom company or internet service provider services are access-dependent, because they rely heavily on guaranteed access cooperation on the network the service is delivered over. For instance, traditional IP-based TV service (IPTV) delivered by a telecom company is generally a managed service. This means that IPTV service assumes the IPTV service provider has control over the access network that the IPTV service is delivered over, and network quality of service (QoS) guarantees are available for IPTV service delivery. As a result, the reach of a telecom company's IPTV service is generally restricted by the reach of the telecom company's access network. In contrast, services offered by non-traditional video content delivery service providers such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video are considered access-independent services. Netflix's video content streaming service, for example, dynamically adapts to network conditions in real-time to strive for the best overall quality of experience (QoE) and does not assume guaranteed cooperation from the underlying IP network, such as QoS. As a result, without considering content rights and different countries' government restrictions, the reach of Netflix's video content streaming service is, in theory, the reach of the Internet. Skype is another example of AIS, because Skype offers an IP-based telephony service over the Internet without depending on IP network cooperation guarantees other than basic IP network connectivity. In the context of telecom service delivery, the concept of access independent services is also commonly described by the term \\"over- the-top\\" (OTT) services. OTT service providers such as but not limited to Facebook, WeChat, and Netflix generally do not own or directly manage any wide-area access network to begin with, so they design their services for overall quality of experience, with no assumptions on guaranteed access network cooperation.

The major premise of the syllogism is that some principle is characteristic of being a Christian. The minor premise is that the characteristic is present in oneself. The conclusion is that one is a Christian. Works are said to be the epistemological ground of faith and justification, rather than the ontological ground, because the evidences of faith only make faith apparent; they do not create it. John Calvin recognizes that outward signs of God's favor may confirm faith, but warns against inferring election from such signs. Faith is always to be placed in the preaching of the gospel rather than any outward action of the believer, but the outward actions may be a final confirmation of election. The concept is present in several Reformed confessions of faith. The Heidelberg Catechism includes assurance as one of the reasons Christians should perform good works.

The book expands on Huemer's early writing defending moral realism. Reception Reviews in academic publications The book was reviewed by David McNaughton of Florida State University on Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews. The review was generally positive, and concluded thus: \\"This book has many merits. It is generally clear, well-argued, timely, and thought-provoking. Not the least of its merits, however, is that it contains a large element of truth. Huemer is understandably frustrated that so many people still misrepresent intuitionism and fail to take it seriously. But it is making a return, and currently has more proponents than he sometimes seems to suggest. His book should help create some more.\\" However, McNaughton's review was critical of Huemer's phenomenal conservatism and suggested that doxastic conservatism would have been more convincing. Mark Schroeder of the University of Southern California reviewed the book in Philosophy and Phenomenological Research. Schroder defended his metaethical perspective, reductive realism, against Huemer's criticisms, noting that one could be a realist while rejecting the dualist metaphysics that underpinned Huemer's analysis.

The seaport covers an area of about 150 hectares. It was declared as a national port in 1956. It serves as an alternate port to the Port of Manila. In the 90's it was the second biggest port in the Philippines in terms of revenue, just behind the Port of Manila. Terminals The seaport in 2008.  Cargo terminal  The Batangas Container Terminal (BCT) of the Batangas International Port is operated by listed Asian Terminals Inc. is a major trading port outside Metro Manila serving major industries in Southern Luzon. BCT handled over 85,000 twenty- foot equivalent units (TEUs) of international containers from January to July 2016. In 2015 the terminal handled 130,000 TEUs in 2015, 28.9% of its actual capacity of 450,000 TEUs. The Port of Batangas in 2014 was only handling 12,000 TEUs or 2.7% of its actual capacity. Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) discounts in the port and docking fees at the Batangas Port attracted more foreign and local shipping firms and incentivized them for helping decongest Manila's facilities. In 2016 it was reported that the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has proposed to transfer operations of the Port of Manila to the Batangas International Port, citing the fact that most of the domestic shipping largely comes from South of Manila, saying that ship operating costs would be relatively lower if vessels were docked in Batangas City rather than in Manila. Other competing ports such as the Port of Subic Bay are also providing container storage services to ease congestion at the Manila ports. In August 2014, PPA reported an 85%‚Äì89% yard utilization for the MICT and Manila South Harbor.  Passenger terminal The Batangas port is also a gateway for passengers, Roro/ferry (terminal 2) and tourist traffic. There are 3 passenger terminals located inside the port, after the toll entrance. The presence of a population of hustlers, tourist guides, and pushy unofficial port authority \\"helpers\\" targeting tourists can be a problem especially for foreign visitors who are not familiar with the organization of the terminal. The boats have tendency not to leave on time, and the poor reputation of the passenger terminal is in serious need of improvement. Some Roro ferry services also seem to consistently fail meeting maritime safety standards due to minimum ship maintenance, and chronic overload. On passenger terminal 3, ferry tickets for Puerto Galera, a popular tourist destination, can be purchased directly on arrival next to the piers to Sabang, Whitebeach, Muelle and Balatero. This city is situated approximately 01:15-hour away from Batangas port on the north tip of Mindoro island across the Verde island passage from Luzon (the main island where Manila is situated). Before boarding, passengers also need to a pay in cash a variety of local taxes such as an environmental user fee and terminal fee. Puerto Galera is accessible through regular ferry lines operating 60 to 120 passenger outrigger ferries i.e. traditional big \\"bangka\\", including FSL or Father and Son Shipping Lines and MSL, Minolo Shipping Lines, Challenge and Passion Shipping Lines. Other passenger regular lines include access by ferry to : * the Sibuyan Island (Romblon province) from Batangas to the port of Romblon and then Cajidiocan, or with a transfer in Romblon to Azagra, Magdiwang/Ambulong.

Administration The Batangas port is under the management of Philippine Ports Authority (PPA), the port administration in the Philippines, created in 1975 and attached to what is now the Department of Transportation (DOTr) for policy and program coordination. Port administration was merged with the traditional function of revenue collection of the Bureau of Customs (BOC). PPA is also vested with the function of undertaking all port construction projects under its port system. The port falls within the administrative jurisdiction of the Customs Collection District of Batangas or Collection District IV, an area defined by the BOC which comprises the province of Aurora, Batangas, Quezon, Marinduque, Oriental and Occidental Mindoro, Palawan. Batangas City which hosts the port is defined by the customs as the district's principal port of entry while the sub-ports of entry are designated as Puerto Princesa in Palawan and Plaridel, Quezon and Aurora.  Expansion and development issues  In March 2016, Operator Asian Terminals Inc. announce plans to invest primarily to improve port operations in the Batangas port, as well as the Port of Manila. The plan involves increasing the capacity of the port which is projected to accommodate more domestic passengers and international container cargoes. The port of Batangas can improve its attractiveness in providing competitively-priced electricity or energy to investors and in offering higher quality maritime services. Regulations and ease-of-doing- business policies and standard operating procedures can be improved significantly. The size of interior roads connecting the port leads to congestion that renders highways and expressways far less effective. The connection of the port to the Southern Tagalog Arterial Road (STAR Tollway) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEx) without passing through the Batangas City proper would be needed. In addition, the construction of a railway system connecting the Port of Batangas to metro Manila would certainly accelerate its development. These topics are regularly debated at the provincial level in particular during the Batangas governor election.

This cornbread (Galician: broa or boroa in Asturian: boro√±a in Cantabria: cornbread, of Celtic origin, compare Welsh and Breton baran bread) is a bread made with cornmeal. It is a traditional food from the regions of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country and northern Castilla-Leon (areas of Le√≥n, Palencia and Burgos), Spain. It has been widely used in rural areas until the mid twentieth century. It is usually cooked in an oven wrapped in cabbage leaves. In Cantabria, by extension, it is called borona, the corn plant bread, and is called \\"flour corn bread\\" flour. History Before corn reached the Iberian Peninsula from the American continent, there and was a type of cornbread, s mixed bread made from barley and rye [0] which was eaten in northern Spain, as shown by the calf of the behetr√≠as Castile, the fourteenth century, [1] as follows Cantabrians documents stating in the fifteenth century. [2] After the arrival of the Spaniards to the New World in 1492, was still called borona for breads made with millet that the authors of the time attributed to the Basques, [3] although that bread had been consumed in more northern sites. The term borona reappears in 1619 in the town of Oseja Sajambre, located in the Picos de Europa, in a context that suggests it was about corn bread, [4] so this would be the reference historically oldest known so far, the cornbread as we understand it today. In 1794 Jovellanos speaks of \\"cornbread or cornbread\\" that was eaten in the Principality of Asturias in the Report of the Economic Society of Madrid. Features The mixture of wheat flour (spelled flour) and corn (2/3 corn flour and other wheat flour) makes the interior color of cornbread a pale yellow. The dough mass is usually put into a mold. It can be rectangular, though now usually toroidal shape. The traditional recipe includes in the dough some slices of chorizo and various meats including prime rib ('costiella'). The dough goes with the mold in an oven and cooked at relatively low temperatures overnight. Serve To serve cornbread opens in half and the meat content inside to be eaten with bread dough baked rolls over.

Bisaillon served in the National Assembly of Quebec from 1976 to 1985, initially as a member of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) and later as an independent. Early life and private career Bisaillon was born in Montreal and studied at the Coll√®ge Saint-Paul, the √âcole normale Jacques-Cartier, and the Universit√© de Montr√©al. He has a teaching diploma and a master's degree in public administration from the √âcole nationale d'administration publique (ENAP). He worked as a teacher for seven years and, during this time, became an active member of the labour movement. From 1971 to 1973, he was an administrator with the Centrale d'enseignement du Qu√©bec (CEQ).Guy Bisaillon (biography), National Assembly of Quebec, October 2008, accessed 28 November 2013. In August 1976, Bisaillon led a high-profile campaign in support of the Gens de l'Air du Qu√©bec, an organization of francophone air traffic controllers who were fighting a federal regulation restricting the use of French in their workplace.\\"Back air traffic controllers, French teachers urged,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 August 1976, p. 9; \\"The parties' drive for big names is on in the Quebec election,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 October 1976, p. 11. Political career Bisaillon became politically active as a member of the radical Rassemblement pour l'Ind√©pendance Nationale (RIN), a precursor to the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. He later became a prominent figure on the PQ's ind√©pendantiste left-wing and often quarreled with its more moderate and gradualist leadership.William Johnson, \\"Analysis hits PQ in Achilles heel,\\" Globe and Mail, 30 August 1979, p. 8. He first ran for office in the 1973 Quebec provincial election in the division of Taillon, where he was narrowly defeated by Liberal incumbent Guy Leduc. PQ legislator Bisaillon agreed to stand aside to permit PQ leader Ren√© L√©vesque to run in Taillon in the 1976 provincial election. Running instead in Sainte-Marie, he was elected with a convincing victory over Liberal incumbent Jean-Claude Mal√©part.Richard Cleroux, \\"Levesque overloaded with potential members of cabinet,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 November 1976. There was some speculation that L√©vesque might appoint Bisaillon to cabinet as a means of restricting his political independence, though ultimately this did not occur.Hubert Bauch, \\"New Parti Quebecois MNAs swear allegiance to Queen,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 November 1976, p. 10. As a government backbencher, Bisaillon campaigned for the L√©vesque administration to strengthen its anti-scab legislation in 1977.\\"PQ's 'anti-scab' bill provokes demonstration by labor,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 November 1976. In 1978, he and fellow PQ representative Guy Chevrette worked as mediators to end a strike by editorial support workers at the newspaper Le Soleil.\\"Last union signs with Le Soleil after 10 months,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 June 1978, B2. Bisaillon wrote a critical status review of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois in 1979; while this was intended as a private document for internal circulation, it was soon leaked to the media and caused a storm of controversy. Bisaillon criticized the party for downplaying its support of Quebec independence and accused the PQ leadership of stifling debate within the party. Journalist William Johnson noted that Bisaillon's review represented the concerns of many within the party. In early 1980, Bisaillon and fellow PQ legislator Denise Leblanc launched a committee to raise money in support of the Parti acadien in New Brunswick. This initiative was not supported by the PQ leadership.\\"Quebeckers to aid cause of Acadians,\\" Globe and Mail, 1 February 1980, p. 8. In October 1980, Bisaillon was the only member of the Quebec legislature to vote against back to work legislation for the province's striking teachers.The legislation was passed 68-1, with the opposition parties supporting the PQ government. See \\"End strikes, teachers told by Quebec,\\" Globe and Mail, 25 October 1980, p. 3. In 1981, Bisaillon took part in a civic committee that recommended parole for former Front de lib√©ration du Qu√©bec (FLQ) militant Paul Rose.Richard Cleroux, \\"Denial of Rose parole unfair, panel charges,\\" Globe and Mail, 19 February 1981, p. 12. Bisaillon was re-elected for a second term in the 1981 provincial election. Later in the same year, he organized a gathering of various left- wing movements in Montreal and openly speculated about leaving the PQ, charging that it had drifted from its original goals.Margot Gibb Clark, \\"Referendum not biased pro-Levesque, PQ says,\\" Globe and Mail, 17 December 1981, p. 8; \\"Unhappy Pequiste may or may not quit,\\" Globe and Mail, 5 January 1982, p. 9. He initially chose to remain within the party but, ultimately, resigned to serve as an independent legislator on June 21, 1982.\\"PQ member decides to stick with party,\\" Globe and Mail, 21 January 1982, p. 10. In making this decision, he cited his opposition to the PQ's labour policies and its downplaying of sovereignty. Independent legislator In late 1982, Bisaillon voted against a government bill imposing new contracts and wage rollbacks on Quebec's public sector workers.\\"Quebec tables bill on wage rollbacks,\\" Globe and Mail, 10 December 1982, p. 8; \\"Levesque defends imposed contracts,\\" Globe and Mail, 11 December 1982, p. 4. He called for the abolition of Quebec's inheritance taxes in 1984, saying they caused more harm than benefits.Graham Fraser, \\"PQ budget called empty of substance,\\" Globe and Mail, 24 May 1984, p. 8. In 1985, he introduced a motion to permit injured workers to receive full compensation in disputed cases until such time as all appeals were exhausted.Jennifer Robinson, \\"Committee chairman casts vote to erase PQ loss,\\" Globe and Mail, 22 February 1985, A4. Bisaillon strongly criticized the PQ government in a debate over a motion of non-confidence in March 1985, charging that L√©vesque's administration had demonstrated \\"a total lack of vision and rigor when dealing with the economy, constitutional negotiations, or the public service\\" and had \\"accomplished virtually nothing for more than four years.\\"\\"PQ narrowly survives Liberal non-confidence vote,\\" Montreal Gazette, 15 March 1985, A4. Shortly after this time, he moved a separate non-confidence motion that charged the government with \\"inability to implement a policy of full employment.\\" The government narrowly survived both motions. During this period, Bisaillon became the unofficial leader of a group of seven former P√©quiste legislators who formed a de facto opposition party in the legislature.\\"PQ facing another non-confidence vote,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 March 1985, A4; \\"PQ survives non-confidence vote,\\" Montreal Gazette, 29 March 1985, A4. In May 1985, Bisaillon and three other party dissidents sponsored a private member's bill to recognize Quebec's right to self-determination.Daniel Drolet, \\"Ex-Pequistes table pro-independence bill,\\" Montreal Gazette, 16 May 1985, A5. The bill was unsuccessful. The following month, the National Assembly of Quebec approved a bill to restrict the franchise in school board elections, such that only Catholics and Protestants would be able to vote in elections for the Montreal Catholic School Commission and the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal, respectively. A practical consequence of the bill was to withdraw the franchise from Jews, Muslims, and other non-Catholics and non-Protestants. The only representatives to vote against the bill were members of the Quebec Liberal Party and Bisaillon.Peggy Curran, \\"House adopts bill depriving Jews, Moslems of city school board vote,\\" Montreal Gazette, 5 June 1985, A4. Bisaillon did not seek re-election in 1985. Later career Bisaillion worked with ENAP between 1985 and 1987 and later became active in radio and as a labour relations consultant. He became director-general of the Coop√©rative de d√©veloppement r√©gional de Montr√©al-Laval in 1997 and was chosen as its president in 2004.

It traversed north-south under the former Canadian National (CN) railyards between 104 Avenue and 105 Avenue, . It was 168 metres in length, 3.3 metres in height, and constructed to accommodate automobile, bicycle and pedestrian traffic. The City of Edmonton proposed the construction of a tunnel/underpass in 1926 to burrow under a span of 22 railway tracks in the old CN railyards. A call for tenders was put out in the following year, 1927, with seven parties bidding for the contract. Jamies Construction Co. Ltd. received the contract from city engineer A. W. Haddow to construct the tunnel. The 109 Street subway was officially opened by then Mayor Ambrose Bury on October 19, 1928. An Edmonton alderman later coined the name ‚Äúrathole‚Äù for the tunnel. In 1957, a transportation study recommended the construction of a parallel subway to improve the traffic flow. However, in lieu of this recommendation, in 1960 the city constructed an overpass over the CN rail tracks further to the east along 105 Street. The tunnel was susceptible to seasonal flooding, and proved hazardous because of its low clearance and visibility upon entrance and exit. There were also safety issues concerning pedestrian usage of the tunnel. The tunnel remained opened for 73 years, during which, as many as 27,000 cars passed through daily. With the railway yard now removed, the city tendered the project for the demolition of the tunnel and conversion of the area into a divided arterial road in 2000. Standard General Inc. was awarded prime contractor for the project. The project began in April 2000, at which time, there were concerns of inconvenience during the scheduled four months for the project. City transportation engineers managed to complete the project three weeks ahead of schedule without compromising safety, environmental, and budgetary concerns. This was accomplished by beginning demolition of the tunnel from the north end instead of taking the entire tunnel out at once. Concrete removed from the tunnel was recycled and used in the fill. On July 4, 2000, 109 Street reopened as a six-lane divided arterial road running between 104 Avenue and 105 Avenue. In 2002, the project was awarded the American Public Works Association Project of the Year Award, the first time the award was won by a Canadian firm of consulting engineers.

Bash valves have the advantage of great simplicity, for manufacture and operation. Their disadvantages are that their opening and closing times are relatively crudely controlled, compared to other types of valve gear. The valve is usually constructed as a circular poppet valve with a conical seat, inserted into the cylinder from the outside. A protrusion on the inside is hit by the piston as it approaches top dead centre, forcing the valve open. Bash valves are usually held closed by the pressure of fluid in the reservoir behind them. There may be a light spring to assist closing when the reservoir is empty. For this reason they are used as inlet valves, not exhaust. An exhaust bash valve would have the cylinder pressure and the piston actuation both acting to open it, with nothing to close it.  Steam engines  Bash valves are not widely used in steam engines, although they are known. Most examples were applied to some form of uniflow steam engine; unlike the more common slide and piston-valved engines with their bidirectional-flow ports, uniflow engines use inlet ports at the cylinder ends and an exhaust near the centre. Although the opening time of a bash valve is fixed, imprecisely controlled and always occurs near top dead centre, this is not a major drawback for a steam engine. A more important requirement is the ability to accurately control the closing time of the valve, and for its duration to be adjustable in order to 'drive' the engine, according to varying load. Some designs of uniflow engine have used a combined mechanical and electromagnetic valve to do this. The valve is opened mechanically, then held by an electromagnet. This requires less electrical power to merely hold the valve than to open it. A patent for such an engine was granted to Sturtevant in 1968. Advanced Uniflow Steam Engine Red = high-pressure steam, controlled by the electromagnetically retained bash valve. The same idea has recently been revived as the main feature of an Advanced Uniflow Steam Engine. In this engine, a second valve is used for exhaust purposes in the later part of the cycle too, although this one is bashed shut, rather than opened. Bash valves have also been used for the ad hoc conversion of commonplace petrol small engines, such as lawnmowers, into hobbyist steam engines. The original petrol engine sparkplug mounting hole is used as the location for a new piston-actuated bash valve, together with the original exhaust valve. Performance and efficiency are not a need of such projects.  Pneumatic motors  Pneumatic rock drill, with a bash valve above the working cylinder Valve chest, arc valve and tappet of a pneumatic rock drill One successful application for bash valves has been to pneumatic motors. Owing to the characteristics of compressed air pneumatic power, their simplicity is valuable and their inefficiencies with other fluids are less important. Compressed air is supplied cold to the motor.Although air becomes heated during compression, there is still little usable heat in the supplied air, compared to steam. Energy is represented solely by the pressure of the air not, unlike steam, by the combination of pressure and temperature. Efficient operation of a steam engine relies upon expansion of the steam during the piston stroke, which relies upon accurate valve timing and an early closure of the valve. During the expansion phase of the steam it does not expand in a simple isothermal fashion, but does so adiabatically, much of the energy having been supplied as heat rather than pressure. The compressed air motor is thermodynamically simpler. It uses simple isothermal expansion.Strictly this is an adiabatic expansion too, but it is approximately isothermal, at least compared to the steam engine. This means that expansion is less important, valve timings are thus longer and less crucial and so a simple valve may be adequate. To provide long opening times, the bash valve normally incorporates some form of tappet mechanism. Rather than a valve that is held open by the piston directly, the valve becomes double-acting and is opened by the piston's impact at one end of the stroke and closed by a further impact at the other end of the stroke. The tappet and valve are commonly separate, allowing the valve to remain in a well-defined fully open position throughout the stroke, however the tappet is bounced around by the piston. Where a reciprocating action is produced, such as for a rock drill, the valve may be actuated either by inertia of the frame or by the movement of the working piston. As the piston hammers back and forth, it impacts a small tappet, which in turn moves the air valve and so reverses the flow of air to the piston. One form of this, the arc tappet valve, was an important feature of the Ingersoll rock drill, the first successful compressed air rock drill for use in mining and tunneling. This used a valve that rotated in a slight arc, rather than sliding. The valve was double-acting, controlling the air supply for both the power and the return stroke. The innovation that made this valve so reliable, thus successful, was a separate tappet that was actuated by the piston in passing at the middle of the stroke, rather than being hammered by a jarring direct impact of the piston. The mid-stroke actuation also opened the valve passageways earlier, before top dead centre, allowing in air that provided a cushioning effect. This further improved the action of the drill, giving a powerful stroke on the working piston and drill rod, but with less damaging hammering to the frame of the drill.  Internal combustion engines  Bash valves are not used in such engines. The cylinder peak pressures of an Otto cycle engine are too high for such a valve to remain on its seat.  Single-shot valves  Bash valves are also used in a 'single-shot' situation, where a valve is opened once and then remains open until the contents of a pressure vessel are released. Such valves are used in some fire extinguishers and pre-charged air rifles. These valves are arranged so that once lifted off their seat, pressure underneath the valve becomes sufficient to keep the valve raised and so it remains open until the pressure reservoir is empty. The valve is then closed by a light spring.

The speaker concept set out transparent and natural sound as the goal, and the achievement of the end result is widely acknowledged. The BBC granted licences to a small number of British firms, who first manufactured the product in 1975. The product underwent a change in 1987 due to consistency issues in manufacturing, and again in around 2003 when original parts from KEF ran out. Upwards of 60,000 pairs of the speaker have been sold. Reviewers have recognised its enormous importance as a bookshelf design.  History  The LS3/5A is a commercially produced loudspeaker driven by the need of the BBC to monitor and assess broadcast programme quality. It was derived from the LS3/5, which was conceived and developed by the BBC Engineering Department in the early 1970s, when it was under the stewardship of Dudley Harwood. Having found no commercially produced small loudspeaker that met the requirement for naturalness and sonic neutrality, the BBC specifically set out to design a speaker to achieve natural overall sound quality and good dynamic range for monitoring broadcasts in tightly confined spaces. As the BBC broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, it was found that the supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised. The BBC's Designs Department was called upon to adapt the product in light of the supply changes. Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A. The BBC then licensed the product to a small number of private sector companies. Production began in 1975. In 1987, as a result of reassessment of the product due to consistency issues in the manufacture of the mid‚Äìbass driver, the drivers were modified and the crossover changed. The overall impedance of the crossover fell to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. The various official versions of the LS3/5A from various licensees sold in significant numbers in its life of over a quarter of a century. Sales estimates range from 60,000 to 100,000 pairs. In the tail end of the 1990s, due to the parts being discontinued, the 3/5 had technically reached the end of the road. Some licensees continued to make small numbers of speakers, for a while, using re-manufactured parts. However, Stirling Broadcast, one of the last batch of licensees, completely redesigned the product based on the audio signature of the original, and launched the LS3/5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006. In 2014, production of the 15 ohm version of the LS3/5a with a full BBC Licence was re-commenced by Falcon Acoustics [25] using re-engineered versions of the original drive units and the original design BBC crossover [4] all produced in-house.  Speaker   Name  The product name is derived from BBC naming convention: the \\"LS3\\" designation meant it was a loudspeaker intended for outside broadcasting, as opposed to the \\"LS5\\" loudspeaker, intended for studio monitoring. The number after the stroke is the model number, the LS3/5 is \\"number 5\\" outside-broadcasting loudspeaker. The letter that follows denotes alterations to the original specification, of which there was only one in this instance after the LS3/5, thus the \\"A\\".  Design  The speaker with its characteristic diffraction-absorbing foam surround for tweeterFor its outside broadcasting monitoring, the BBC required a small studio monitor suitable for near-field monitoring of the frequency range from 400 Hz to about 20 kHz. The principal constraints were space and situations where using headphones is unsatisfactory, such as in mobile broadcasting vans. There were no commercial constraints. The BBC Research Department, then situated at Kingswood Warren, were responsible for development work, and commenced scaling tests in 1968. They were able to answer a request for a prototype in under a week because it resembled an experimental loudspeaker that the department had already developed for some preliminary acoustic scaling tests. The speaker had to be voiced by ear an octave at a time, because scale test results were inapplicable to a model of this size. Engineers took measurements; comparisons were performed against the LS5/8 ‚Äì a large \\"Grade I monitor\\" already in use at the time ‚Äì and with live sources. In 1970 engineers came up with the LS3/5, built using the KEF B110 (A6362) and the KEF T27 (A6340) drive units, and a 9-ohm crossover filter. Estimated development costs of the order of ¬£100,000 were said to have been incurred at the time. Approximately 20 units of the LS3/5 were produced in-house. The BBC had initiated tendering to have the LS3/5 made under licence. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, it was found that KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns.[2][4] The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent interference pattern effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974. The KEF B110 SP1003 is a 110mm speaker with a doped Bextrene (a proprietary type of polystyrene copolymer) cone and a neoprene surround. The KEF T27 SP1032 has a 19mm mylar dome fitted and is with a perforated protection grille. The loudspeaker has an internal volume of approximately 5 litres. The speaker cabinet (loudspeaker enclosure) measuring , is made using birch plywood strengthened at every joint with beech braces, and heavily damped. Although there was no specification for the wood of the original LS3/5 cabinets, the BBC closely specified wood types in defining the LS3/5A due to concerns that other hard woods ‚Äì specifically Parana pine, with which the BBC conducted tests ‚Äì would cause noticeable colouration (i.e. detract from sonic neutrality) due to interaction with a resonance of the bass drivers. Martin Colloms notes in Hi-Fi Critic that: \\"Hardly any component in either enclosure or driver may be substituted without the blend suffering audible disturbance. This is because the 3/5A sets such a high standard for tonal balance that errors which would pass unnoticed in an ordinary speaker are readily exposed\\". The BBC then licensed the product to a small number of private sector companies. In a review in Stereophile, John Atkinson remarked on how it was \\"virtually unknown for a speaker to be still available, virtually unchanged, 14 years after [its introduction]\\".  Construction  J. Gordon Holt indicates in Stereophile that most of the cost lay inside the case, having been spent on a complex equaliser and phase-corrected crossover. However, Holt's colleague, John Atkinson, notes that the cabinet alone \\"costs the manufacturer the same as the retail price of a typical speaker\\". Only specific speaker drivers manufactured to strict tolerances may be used. There were other measures to control diffraction and ensure tonal neutrality. The circuitry provides equalisation in both high and low frequency sections. The 13-element crossover includes an inductor for the treble section with seven positions that allows adjustment to match level of mid to treble sensitivities. The design also specifies high quality screened air-gap inductors and film capacitors. David Prakel in Hi-Fi Answers suggests it was a costlier speaker to build than imagined because tight specifications meant a high failure rate in production ‚Äì the BBC had specified \\"the finest, most expensive ingredients and representing an investment of hours of skilled labour\\".  Signature sound  Typical of sealed-box speakers of similar size, the 3/5A has little or no low bass, but the design reinforced its lower register by a boost at around 160 Hz, giving the subjective impression that the speaker is more bass-rich. It has a gently rising frequency response above 5kHz, leading reviewers to notice the sound being a little bright at the treble registers, or that the speakers \\"reproduce the high-end roughness of solid-state amplifiers mercilessly\\" thus suggested partnering with valve amplification would be advantageous. A slight nasal quality in the midrange has also been noted in the earlier versions. The accuracy and stability of its stereo imaging and its clean midrange reproduction are also appreciated qualities. J. Gordon Holt suggests that the quality was \\"comparable to that from Quad Electrostatics, at far lower cost and with added bonuses of slightly smoother high end, better stereo imaging, a broader listening area\\". John Atkinson suggests in Stereophile that the LS3/5A is ideally suited to the reproduction of program having a limited dynamic-range requirement, for example chamber music; he said that the LS3/5A \\"has never boogied and never will; it's just too polite ever to cut the mustard on rock, or even straightahead jazz\\".  Constructors  Versions of the speaker (mostly from Rogers) of various vintages on display in a second-hand shopA total of 11 companies were ever granted licences by the BBC to manufacture the model, a maximum of 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, if for no other reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, grille fabric, or the origin of the wool. Rogers Audio was the earliest licensee, but went out of business before producing a single unit. The Rogers name was bought by Swisstone, who started manufacturing the 3/5A under licence in 1975. Rogers' production accounted for the majority, of around 43,000 pairs by 1988, and 50,000 pairs in total. Of the other main manufacturers, Spendor produced about 22,000 pairs, and Audiomaster 10,000. Dudley Harwood, the BBC engineer instrumental in the creation of the 3/5A, started Harbeth and obtained a licence in 1977, but the company produced no LS3/5As for a decade. Eventually, Harbeth accounted for 7,000 pairs. KEF, who obtained its licence in 1993 (and at which point there were 4 concurrent manufacturer licensees), claims approximately 4,000 pairs were made from 1994-1998. Other licensees included Chartwell, RAM, Goodmans and Stirling Broadcast.A current licence for the 15 ohm LS3/5a is held by Falcon Acoustics  Reception  Despite not being a \\"commercial product\\" at the outset, the LS3/5A was commercially successful in its twenty-something-year life, from 1975 until approximately 2000, when the availability of KEF drive units came to an end. The speaker has amassed an \\"enthusiastic, focused, and loyal [...] following, and none so large or vocal\\", according to Paul Seydor in The Absolute Sound. Estimates of their sales differ, possibly due to scope and cut-off: when it ceased production in 1998, \\"some 100,000 pairs were in circulation, with 3000 pairs sold in its last year alone\\", according to Seydor; in 2001, Ken Kessler similarly estimated in Hi-fi News that 100,000 pairs had been produced. In 2007, Martin Colloms reported \\"more than 60,000 pairs of the original LS3/5As were made\\". John Atkinson noted that it had sold in excess of 60,000 up to 1988, of which Rogers represented two-thirds. Atkinson notes in 2007 that the sound of the speaker had not dated whilst many other speakers of the 1960s and 70s had. He guessed that LS3/5A remained competitive due to the exhaustive considerations and top engineering talent that went into its design; maybe some luck was involved. Art Dudley commented in Stereophile on the LS3/5A's \\"towering significance\\" as a bookshelf design.  Product revisions   1987‚Äì1990  It had become apparent in around 1987 that a number of units already in the field were not up to specification. In particular, it was becoming increasingly difficult to obtain KEF drivers of acceptable tolerances, especially the woofer. Measurements of the 1‚Äì1.5 kHz peak of some units produced at the time were up to 6dB higher. KEF underwent a program to improve consistency of both drive-unit and the associated crossover, taking care not to alter frequency characteristics or tonal balances. KEF specially redesigned the B110, creating the B110 SP1228 where the surround changed from neoprene to a vinyl compound. KEF also designed a new crossover, designated SP2128. The crossover, also redesigned to accommodate the changes, saw its overall impedance fall to 11 ohms from the original 15 ohms. KEF also manufactured and supplied the crossover with the drive units in kits where the pairs have been electrically matched by computer to ensure balanced performance. Martin Colloms had implied in Hi-fi News in August 1988 that the BBC had taken a pragmatic decision to a revise the design, to ensure that targeted production levels could be maintained. In 1990, the BBC authorised licensees to manufacture models capable of being bi-wired, but stipulated that the performance in single-wired mode must meet the original specification. KEF started making the bi-wire crossover, designated SP2195, available in 1991.  2005 ‚Äì birth of LS3/5A \\"V2\\"  Upon obtaining a BBC licence to produce legacy 11-ohm LS3/5A, Stirling Broadcast commissioned KEF to produce new T27 and B110 drive units. Stirling had to rethink the product when KEF finally ceased manufacturing the drive units in about 2000. Working with drivers from SEAS and Scanspeak, Derek Hughes developed for Stirling a new crossover that enabled the new proprietary drivers to mimic the response of the original KEF drivers they replaced. Specifically, the T27 was replaced by a 19mm doped fabric dome tweeter. The mid‚Äìbass unit is a formed polypropylene co-polymer cone to which a damping coating has been applied and given a synthetic rubber roll surround. The crossover has three settings of relative high frequency level, in steps of 0.5dB. Each crossover is tuned to the specific pairs of drive units. While Stirling's revision deviates technically from the specification, the company took steps to research and test to ensure the LS3/5A sound was preserved, \\"warts and all\\". Stirling added a \\"V2\\" to the designation when the product was launched in 2005 in an act of transparency, even though the broadcaster has endorsed it. 2014 ‚Äì 15 ohm LS3/5A back in production Falcon Acoustics was granted a licence by the BBC for the 15 ohm version of the LS3/5a in 2013 and commenced production in 2014 using drive units produced in-house by Falcon Acoustics. The Falcon F B110 bass unit is a re-engineered version using the same components of the original KEF B110 SP1003 with a doped Bextrene cone and a neoprene surround. The Falcon F T27 tweeter again uses the same components as the original KEF T27 SP1032 and has a 19mm mylar dome fitted. Both Falcon units were designed by Malcolm Jones who while employed at KEF between 1962 and 1974 was responsible for the design of the KEF B110 and T27 units originally used in the LS3/5 and LS3/5a. Both units are graded/selected to meet the BBC specification. Crossovers are close tolerance pair matched versions of the original BBC LS3/5a crossover design [4] using tapped transformers for high frequency adjustments. [25]  Contemporary clones  The Linn Kan, considered a clone of the LS3/5A  Linn  In 1979, Linn Products created the Kan ‚Äì a non-BBC specification bookshelf speaker that used a LS3/5A-sized cabinet and the same B110 driver from KEF. Linn acquired a hundred pairs of cabinets from the supplier of the bankrupt Chartwell, and used them for the very first Kans. The Kan, however, used a Scanspeak D2008 tweeter, subsequently followed by a re-badged OEM D20-LP-1 tweeter from Hiquphon in May 1984. Linn installed a very simple crossover into the box that transformed it into \\"one of the fastest and most involving wall mount miniatures ever\\", according to Martin Colloms.  J R Loudspeakers  Jim Rogers, who set up J R Loudspeakers Ltd after the collapse of Rogers Audio, released the JR149 in 1977 using the same drive units as the LS3/5A in a cylindrical aluminium cabinet. A review of the JR149 in the May 1977 Hi-Fi News and Record Review found that the \\"general quality was very comparable\\" to the LS3/5A.  Spendor  This company, founded in Sussex in the 1960s by Spencer Hughes (a BBC electroacoustic engineer) and his wife Dorothy (hence the brandname) and later owned by Philip Swift, is known for building high-end loudspeakers. Spendor built the LS3/5A and started with a S3/5, which was developed by Spencer's son Derek, in 1998.stereophile.com Jul 13, 2003, Spendor S3/5se loudspeaker, retrieved at 18 January 2020.

KEF  Preceding the 3/5A, KEF's Cresta (1967), KEFKIT4 (1969), Cresta II (1970), Coda (1971) were all 2-way loudspeakers that used the B110/T27 combination. KEF released its CS1A constructor kit (1981) to tap the home-build market. According to the product brochure, the kit includes \\"the same KEF drive units originally specified for the LS3/5A with a somewhat simplified dividing network giving a similar overall frequency response characteristic\\". In 1979, KEF released the Reference 101, a speaker that used the T27 (SP1032) with the B110B (SP1057) in a 6.7-litre cabinet \\"with a crossover of similar complexity to the LS3/5A\\". Martin Colloms said it possessed an almost perfectly flat frequency response, but that \\"it neither sounded as lifelike, nor did it really better the musical performance of the standard 3/5a\\". In 2012, Kef released the ls50 which claimed to be 'An innovative concept inspired by the legendary LS3/5a' Harbeth In 2012, Harbeth released the P3ESR. CNET contributor Steve Guttenberg commented that: \\"Harbeth's terrific P3ESR is a contemporary equivalent of the LS3/5A.

Background The English had raised militia forces in their settled colonies in the New World immediately upon establishing them in the first decade of the 17th century. Whereas militias in England remained little used, outside the period of the English Civil Wars, during the following century, those in the North American colonies were to play significant roles. In many actions fought with Native Americans, the militia were the primary English force in the field, as professional full-time military forces were usually far away. Even when the English colonies around the world became the British Empire, and regular forces began to become available for garrison duty, militias were still a vital part of Great Britain's military power in the Americas, and British victory over Spain and France during the Seven Years' War, and its resulting hegemony in North America, could not have been realised without the colonial militias and their Native allies. It was the presence of their militia that allowed thirteen American colonies to launch the secessionist American War of Independence. Australasia The colonies of Australia did not have militia, nor officially did New Zealand. In 1843 a local militia that had been formed in Wellington without official sanction was immediately disbanded. Bermuda Castle Islands Fortifications and other public buildings in Bermuda ca. 1624. Construction beginning in 1612, these were the first stone fortifications, with the first coastal artillery batteries, built by England in the New World, and were manned by volunteers and the Militia 'til taken over by the regular British Army following the American War of Independence. In the Somers Isles, or Bermuda (originally named Virgineola), a self-governed (rather than Crown) colony settled in 1609 (as a result of the shipwreck of the Sea Venture, flagship of the Virginia Company of London, and originally considered part of the Colony of Virginia), with no native population, the Militia followed a trajectory more like that in Britain, finally becoming moribund after the American War of 1812, by when the build-up of regular forces had removed the demand for the militia. Nevertheless, during the first century of its settlement, Bermuda's militia had remained the colony's sole defence, manning its fortifications and coastal batteries and calling up all available manpower in times of war. This included slaves and indentured servants, among whom were Irish and Scottish Prisoners of war (POW), forcibly removed from their homelands following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and the invasion of Scotland by England during the Third English Civil War and sold to the highest bidder. Large numbers of Irish POWs and civilians were sold in Bermuda, where they were highly antagonistic to the English majority. In 1661, the local government alleged that a plot was being hatched by an alliance of Blacks and Irish, one which involved cutting the throats of all the English. The Irish were perceived as the chief instigators of this plot. Governor William Sayle prepared for the uprising with three edicts: The first was that a nightly watch be raised throughout the colony; second, that slaves and the Irish (defined by the government as indentured servants, though imported and sold against their will) be disarmed of militia weapons; and third, that any gathering of two or more Irish or slaves be dispersed by whipping (a ban was also placed on the further importation of Irish to Bermuda). Enslaved Bermudians continued to serve in the colony's militia, however, which was to lead a unique judgment on their rights as British subjects. By the 18th century, virtually all Bermudian men were engaged in the maritime trades, including building and crewing ships. The colony's dependence on its seamen was such that the Royal Navy excluded them from impressment, to which all other British seamen were liable. Perennially short of manpower, the crews of Bermuda's merchant fleet (most of which turned to privateering whenever war broke out) were required, by local law, to contain a percentage of black sailors, most of whom were enslaved. British law at the time required that all crewmen of British vessels be British subjects, which slaves were not generally considered to be. Following the arrest of a Bermudian vessel by the Royal Navy due to its enslaved crewmembers, Bermudian ship owners protested to the courts that their service in the militia meant that Bermuda's slaves should be considered British subjects, and this view was upheld by the courts. Bermuda's seasonal occupants of the Turks Islands also raised militias there, as their lucrative salt trade invited attacks from enemies, foreign (France and Spain) and domestic (the Bahamas). The fortifications built in Bermuda by the militia (including the Castle Islands Fortifications), starting in 1612, remain the oldest English new world structures, as well as the first stone fortifications, the first coastal artillery, and the oldest surviving fortifications built by the English in the New World. The militia manned these fortifications with standing bodies of artillerymen until the fortifications were taken over by the regular British Army following the American War of Independence, with some, like Fort St. Catherine's, used well into the 20th Century.

The decree served as the charter of the corporation was revised through Presidential Decree No. 696 issued by Marcos on May 9, 1975. The mandate of the firm is to establish a \\"reliable aviation and aerospace industry\\" in the Philippines, design, manufacture and sell \\"all forms\\" of aircraft, as well as to develop indigenous capabilities in the maintenance, repair, and modification of aviation equipment. It attempted to develop local aircraft such as the PADC Hummingbird helicopter and the PADC Defiant single-engine trainer in the 1980s but the programs were scrapped due to licensing issues and lack of government support. Following a meeting of the Governance Commission for GOCCs in late 2017, PADC is set to be abolished. Those present in the meeting views that PADC has failed its mandate particularly in successfully designing a plane for the last 45 years. A PADC director, Rene Abad, has called for the PADC's ‚Äòrevitalization‚Äô instead, to contribute to the country's development and security.

It was usually published on Thursdays. History The Southern Argus (as distinct from the Northern Argus published in Clare) is one of the state's oldest country newspapers, privately owned by the Elliott and Jones families for 140 years. It was founded by Ebenezer Ward (1837‚Äì1917) in Port Elliot as a weekly newspaper, the first issue appearing on Saturday 17 March 1866. While primarily called the Southern Argus, for the first decade it was also subtitled; \\"And Strathalbyn, Wellington, Milang, Langhorne's Creek, Woodchester, Mount Barker, Echunga, Macclesfield, Bull's Creek, Clarendon, Noarlunga, Willunga, Aldinga, Sellick's Hill, Myponga, Normanville, Yankalilla, Rapid Bay, Cape Jervis, Inman Valley, Bald Hills, Hindmarsh Valley, Encounter Bay, Victor Harbor, Port Elliot, Middleton, Currency Creek and Goolwa,.and River Murray Advertiser.\\" Ward expected that the new southern port of Port Elliot was to become an enterprising outlet for the River Murray trade. Using the original Observer printing press, Ward set up the newspaper in the small coastal town; its first office was previously J. Barton's shop. In mid-April 1868, following financial difficulties and ownership changes, the production of the newspaper moved to William Colman's shop in Strathalbyn, then on 5 December 1868, to their new building adjacent to the Strathalbyn Post Office. It was purchased in 1871 by William Fisher and Joseph Elliott (c. 1833 ‚Äì 21 May 1883), the latter whose brother James Elliott was the first owner of The Kapunda Herald. The author of this history (Joseph W. Elliott) apparently did not have access to back issues, as the dates and some of the facts do not accord with the contemporary records. Elliott bought his partner out shortly after. The long title of the newspaper persisted until 5 July 1877 when it was shortened to the Southern Argus and River Murray Advertiser. On 4 January 1893, it lengthened again to The Southern Argus Strathalbyn, Goolwa, and River Murray Advertiser, later variously re-adding Victor Harbor, Milang, Meningie. On 14 August 1940, the subtitle was finally removed. Literature The Southern Argus published serials and poems by South Australian writers. The first serial was Middle Life: a tale by James Dunlop, in 1870. Distribution The publication's early coverage included the towns of: Strathalbyn, Wellington, Milang, Langhorne's Creek, Woodchester, Mount Barker, Echunga, Macclesfield, Bull's Creek, Clarendon, Noarlunga, Willunga, Aldinga, Sellick's Hill, Myponga, Normanville, Yankalilla, Rapid Bay, Cape Jervis, Inman Valley, Bald Hills, Hindmarsh Valley, Encounter Bay, Victor Harbor, Port Elliot, Middleton, Currency Creek, and Goolwa.

Provided is an excerpt from the Journal of the British Archeological Association on this subject: The two monuments on the north and south sides of the chancel are described by Silas Taylor in 1665. Speaking of the one on the north side, he says, ‚Äúnear him, on the wall, hangs a wooden shield with the arms of Devereux. Over against it on the south side, another shield hangs up with a cross engrailed between four spear-heads. I could not discern the colours‚Ä¶ A little lower, near the remains of the quire are the effigies of a man in close armour, and a woman‚Äù‚Ä¶ I am disposed to think that the single figure represents Sir W. Devereux, who died in 1402, and the two figures represent John Marbury and Agnes his wife. I think so partly because Silas Taylor says the Devereux shield hung on the north side and the Marbury shield on the south. It has been suggested that the Devereux buried here is Walter Devereux's son and heir, Walter who died in 1420. They base this on the appearance of the armor being consistent with that worn in the 1420s, and the Royal Commission on Historical Monuments indicated a date c. 1430. The counter-argument is that the monument was raised after his death at the time of the death of his widow, Agnes Crophull, in 1437.Rev. H.W. Phillott. On Weobley Church and Castle.

Trade in figures The EU and Indonesia have built robust commercial relations, with bilateral trade amounting to approximately ‚Ç¨25 billion in 2012 resulting in a sizeable ‚Ç¨5.7 billion trade surplus for Indonesia with the EU. In the past few years trade between EU and Indonesia has been marked by an upward trend. Whereas total trade was worth almost ‚Ç¨16 billion in 2009, by 2011 it had already reached ‚Ç¨23.5 billion. For the EU, Indonesia is the 24th largest import source (share 0.9%) and the 30th largest export destination (share 0.6%). Inside the ASEAN region, Indonesia ranks fourth in terms of total trade. The EU is Indonesia's 4th largest trading partner after Japan, China and Singapore, representing almost 10% of its total external trade. The EU is the second largest investor in the Indonesian economy. In the past years, approximately 1000 European companies have invested about ‚Ç¨130 billion in the economy and directly generated employment for 1.1 million Indonesians. EU investment in Indonesia is mostly allocated to mining, infrastructure and manufacturing.EU Jakarta. EU-Indonesia Trade and Investment booklet, p.16-19 Despite the aforementioned positive trend, the EU's share of Indonesia's trade with main partners diminished, from 9.2% in 2010 to 8.7% in 2011 and to 8,1% in 2012. Even at a record high of EUR 25 billion, overall Indonesia‚ÄìEU bilateral trade is well below some of the other neighbours in the region even though Indonesia is the largest economy in ASEAN. Trade value between Singapore and EU is recorded at US$52 billion while trade value between Malaysia and Thailand with the EU is recorded at US$35 billion and US$32 billion, respectively. The share of Indonesia‚Äôs exports shipped to the European market has declined considerably, from 18 per cent to 14 per cent over the last decade. Most of the decline in Indonesia‚Äôs exports to Europe's markets has been redirected to the ASEAN regional market.Lord, M.2010. Indonesia's trade access to the European Union: opportunities and challenges, p.1-2 The EU is Indonesia's second largest source of FDI, however, during the period 2004‚Äì2010, Indonesia received only 1.6% of all EU FDI going into Asia, and only 6% of all EU investments flowing into the ASEAN region. Indonesia mostly exports to the EU agricultural products and processed resources, mainly palm oil, fuels and mining products, textiles and furniture. EU exports to Indonesia consist mainly of high-tech machinery and transport equipment, chemicals and various manufactured goods. Essentially, trade flows between Indonesia and the EU complement each other. Trade in timber Wood and paper products are a key export area for Indonesia with the total average annual value of timber and paper exports from Indonesia reaching US$1.2 billion which is around 15% of Indonesia‚Äôs exports. The main timber products destined for the EU are paper, paper board, wooden furniture and plywood. Indonesia has suffered from severe illegal logging and rapid deforestation since the 1990s, and steps have been taken to strengthen control against the import of illegal timber products from Indonesia. After six years of intensive negotiations, Indonesian Forestry Minister Zulkifli Hasan, European Commissioner for the Environment Janez Potoƒçnik and the Lithuanian Minister of Environment Valentinas Mazuronis signed the Indonesia‚ÄìEuropean Union (EU) Voluntary Partnership Agreement on Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT‚ÄìVPA) in October 2013. This was hailed as an important milestone in Indonesia‚ÄìEU trade relations. The FLEGT-VPA aims to prevent the trade of illegal timber and ensure that only verified legal timber and timber products are imported to the EU from Indonesia. Having signed the agreement, Indonesia and the EU will proceed to the ratification phase of the agreement through their respective processes. Eventually, this will lead to the implementation of the FLEGT-VPA, which will take place when both sides assess the licensing is ready. Trade in palm oil According to the EU statistics (Eurostat) Indonesia's exports of crude palm oil (CPO) have been surging over the last five years from ‚Ç¨265 million in 2008 to ‚Ç¨1.1 billion in 2012. The EU is Indonesia's second largest palm oil market after India. Indonesia's exports of biodiesel have also increased sharply from only ‚Ç¨116 million in 2008 to ‚Ç¨993 million in 2012. Given that there are concerns in Indonesia on the impact of EU's environmental regulations there is a strong dialogue on the issue. An anti-dumping investigation was initiated in August 2012 as there was evidence of dumping by companies from both Indonesia and Argentina of biodiesel on the EU market. Provisional measures were imposed in May 2013. As of 27 November 2013 the EU will impose definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of biodiesel from Indonesia. Free Trade Agreement/CEPA In December 2009, the EU decided to pursue negotiations towards free trade agreements with individual ASEAN countries, beginning with Singapore and followed by Malaysia and Vietnam. Indonesia and the European Union (EU) have agreed to commence talks on a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) as both parties seek to enhance two-way trade and the EU's investments in Indonesia. The decision was informed by the Indonesia‚ÄìEU Vision Group, established in late 2009 based on an initiative from Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, calling for the early launch of talks for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). Besides a FTA, CEPA also envisages capacity-building and trade facilitation. Negotiations started in July, 2016, and the 9th round of talks is scheduled for early December 2019. Trade facilitation Indonesia currently enjoys trade preferences with the EU under the generalized scheme of preferences which grants product imports into the European Union either duty-free access or tariff reductions. At present, almost 40 per cent of Indonesia‚Äôs 13 billion Euros exports to the EU market are eligible for preferential treatment. The EU also carries out a number of projects aimed at improving bilateral trade. The Trade Support Programme, for instance focuses on technical elements affecting the Indonesia‚ÄìEU trade flows: Capacity building in WTO for Indonesian officials, harmonisation of EU Standards, improving of technical laboratories. There is also a yearly business-to-business forum with the goal of increasing trade and investment between Indonesia and the EU. The EU‚ÄìIndonesia Business Dialogue (EIBD) started in 2009 and since then, inputs and recommendations developed by EIBD have helped to improve the climate for doing business between Indonesia and the EU. Sector regulations have been eased, enabling market access on both sides. The overall objective is to facilitate open dialogue between Indonesian and European business communities.

He participated in military expeditions against the Indians prior to the Desert Campaign of the 1830s. He was one of the landowners of Buenos Aires who supported the Independence movements of Argentina.  Militia career  Landowner of Buenos Aires (1840) He was born in Buenos Aires, the son of Mat√≠as Alegre and Francisca de Sosa, belonging to a Creole family from Asunci√≥n. He possibly did his elementary studies in the city of Buenos Aires, and began his military career at the age of nineteen or twenty, serving in the Guardia del Juncal, a fortress built in the town of Ca√±uelas to prevent the advance of the Indians. Most of his services to the Ej√©rcito Espa√±ol were related to militia expeditions in the northern and southern areas of the Province of Buenos Aires. In 1777, Casimiro Alegre led a caravan of fifteen carts, which were to transport three hundred wooden posts for the repair the Fort of Monte, being also the responsible for the construction of the barracks on the shores of Laguna of Monte, an area populated by rebellious Indians.

He lent his oath on February 12, 1780 before the dean councilor of the Cabildo de Buenos Aires Don Gregorio Ramos Mex√≠a. As mayor and captain of militias he participated in several military campaigns against the indigenous incursions in the Province of Buenos Aires. The night of August 27, 1780, in Luj√°n there had been an Indians attack composed of thousands of pampas warriors. The Consejo de guerra of Buenos Aires had appointed to Captain Casimiro Alegre, to lead the punitive expeditions against raids. These military expeditions were properly equipped with flintlocks, carbines, pistols, lances and sabers. He also served in the expeditions against the Portuguese in the Banda Orienta del Uruguay, having an active participation during the Spanish‚ÄìPortuguese War. Towards the end of 1770 he had a social, political and economic rise in the colonial bureaucracy of the R√≠o de la Plata. He served as alcalde de la hermandad in the towns of Magdalena, La Matanza (three times-1790, 1795, 1796) and San Vicente, which also covered the current territory of Almirante Brown. He was entrusted to carry various military and political missions, serving also in the assistance of the first settlers of the province of Buenos Aires. In 1795 he was commissioned by the Viceroy, Pedro Melo de Portugal to make the appraisal of a land located in the current territory of Marcos Paz.

In 1820, he desisted his appointment as mayor of San Vicente, a position that had also been offered to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The provincial militias were conformed with landowners, officers and soldiers of militias and gauchos, and were initially dedicated to the control of the indigenous attacks in the province of Buenos Aires. Years later these militias participated in the Argentine Civil Wars.  Family  record of the Casimiro Alegre family in the 1807 Census of Buenos Aires Lt.

His illustrious ancestors include, among others, Esteban Alegre, who attended the foundation of Buenos Aires by Juan de Garay, and Luis Alegre, a conqueror and expeditionary of Flemish origin, who arrived in the expedition of Pedro de Mendoza. He was also a descendant of Francisco de Paredes, a Spanish conquistador native of Burgos, who arrived at R√≠o de la Plata on the first expedition of Mendoza. His wife Anastacia Espinosa, was a direct descendant of prominent Spanish officials, including Ant√≥n Higueras de Santana, Toribio de Pe√±alva and Juan de Garay y Becerra. His son Cipriano Alegre Espinosa, was married to Mar√≠a Fermina Mart√≠nez, daughter of Joseph Mart√≠nez Mu√±oz and Catalina Roberto Jaimes, a Creole woman, granddaughter of Joseph Roberto, a soldier originally from Milan, who served in the Buenos Aires Fort towards the end of the 17th century. The Mart√≠nez Roberto family was related to Bartolom√© Jaimes, an Andalusian conqueror born in Huelva, and of Francisco Reynolds, belonging to an English-Creole family, linked in turn with the Valencian soldiers, who served in the Spanish Tercios at the service of Philip V of Spain. Other soldiers linked to this family were Ger√≥nimo Vieyra, a Portuguese gunner who served in the Fort of Buenos Aires towards the beginning of the 18th century, and Ram√≥n Sorayre, a who participated in the Argentine Civil War. Casimiro Alegre was a great grandfather of Juan Bourr√© Andrade, a lieutenant colonel of the Argentine Army who participated in the Conquest of the Desert. He was possibly also related to Tom√°s Alegre Manzanares (1853-1911) an officer of the Argentine Navy, who was married to Corina Caravia Guti√©rrez, widow of Guillermo Brown Blanco. The Alegre family was related to livestock (cimarron cattle) in Argentina since the beginning of the conquest. In 1837, his son Saturnino Alegre Espinosa, sold a plot of 225 hectares to its neighbor Hannah Brocksopp, a female landowner of English origin.

He was a former prisoner of Nazi concentration camps in World War II. During the occupation of Poland Dusze≈Ñko was the soldier of Armia Krajowa (the Home Army) in the service of Gr√≥dek Jagiello≈Ñski Inspectorate of Communication in the Lw√≥w district (now Lviv, Ukraine). Arrested in Lw√≥w, he became prisoner of two Nazi concentration camps including Gross-Rosen and Sachsenhausen- Oranienburg. He survived, and later devoted his artistic output to the remembrance of those who had perished. Life and work Dusze≈Ñko was born at Gr√≥dek Jagiello≈Ñski (now Horodok, Ukraine) in the Second Polish Republic eastern region of Kresy. He witnessed the ethnic cleansing accompanying the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland, and the subsequent Operation Barbarossa by Nazi Germany in 1941. He worked in the Underground but at the same time began to study art in Lw√≥w at the already renamed Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts Institute) in 1942 under Professor Marian Wnuk. He was arrested in 1944 and shipped to concentration camps. Following World War II and the annexation of eastern Poland by the Soviet Union Dusze≈Ñko relocated to Gda≈Ñsk where he obtained a fine arts diploma in 1952 and began to teach at his alma mater in the same year. He became Dean at the Faculty of Sculpture in 1960‚Äì64. During the Solidarity years Dusze≈Ñko was appointed Rector of the Academy of Fine Arts in Gda≈Ñsk in 1981, in office until 1987. He served as Head of Sculpture and Drawing Department in 1987‚Äì96. After his tenure, at the request of the authorities of the Gda≈Ñsk Academy, he continued to guide graduating students in their creative work leading toward the final diploma, until 2001. Dusze≈Ñko is the author of several iconic World War II monuments in Poland including the tall Memorial to Victims of the Treblinka extermination camp designed with architect Adam Haupt, and unveiled on site by the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland in the presence of 30,000 guests who attended the ceremony in 1964 including Jewish survivors from Israel, France, Czechoslovakia and Poland. More than 800,000 Jews died in the gas chambers of Treblinka during the Holocaust in Poland. The sculpture represents the trend toward large avant-garde forms introduced in the 1960s throughout Europe, with a granite tower cracked down the middle and capped by a mushroom-like block carved with abstract reliefs and Jewish symbols. He is also the author of the Westerplatte Monument in Gda≈Ñsk (with architects Adam Haupt and Henryk Kitowski) built in 1964‚Äì66, as well as the \\"Polish Gunners\\" in Toru≈Ñ and notable others. His surviving wife, Urszula Ruhnke-Dusze≈Ñko, (1922-2014) was a painter and academic employed in 1952‚Äì71 at the Gda≈Ñsk Academy, initially at the painting atelier of Prof. Juliusz Studnicki, and then as Head of the Painting Studio at the Faculty of Interior Design. His son, Marcin Dusze≈Ñko (1958‚Äì2000) was also an artist and an adjunct at the Faculty of Painting. A big retrospective of Franciszek Dusze≈Ñko's work was organized in January 2013 at the G√ºnter Grass Gallery in Gda≈Ñsk. Dusze≈Ñko was posthumously awarded the Medal of the City of Gda≈Ñsk in 2008.

In 168, this was changed again to Liang. ;Rebellion of the Seven Princes After Emperor Jing ordered the execution of Chao Cuo at the urging of Yuan Ang, Liu Wu was besieged at his capital Suiyang by the armies of Wu and Chu during the Rebellion of the Seven States. His mother the empress dowager Xiaowen urged the emperor to send the imperial army to relieve him. The general Zhou Yafu succeeded in counselling against a direct assault: instead, his force took advantage of disorder among the rebels to establish a strong camp at Xiayi (, modern Dangshan in Anhui) athwart their line of supply and communication along the Si River.The Si was formerly a much larger and more important watercourse, before the southward swing of the Yellow River's AD 1194 flood wiped out its lower reaches. Ignoring Liu Wu's pleas for help and imperial orders to advance to the city, he occupied his time strengthening his defenses and sending Han Tuidang's cavalry raiders to disrupt what little overland supply the rebels could manage from Chu. Having wearied their armies assaulting Suiyang, the rebel princes were forced to fall back for supplies and their assaults on Xiayi were defeated with such prepared ease that Zhou initially refused to be woken from bed. This was effectively the end of the rebellion: the Prince of Chu took his own life and Liu Pi was killed by Yue natives as he fled.Whiting, Marvin.

During his research in the 1980s on the 44M Tas heavy tank he found sources mentioning that components for two chassis of the 44M Tas were made and he jumped to the conclusion that the second hull was for a tank destroyer based on the hull of the 44M Tas design. Due to the very limited information on the 44M Tas project at the time this spread as fact fairly quickly. It was first later in the 2000s that more information was found which explained that the components made where for a second 44M Tas prototype and not for some tank destroyer variant. There is no direct evidence of the project. The assumption was made by the son (P√°l Korbuly) of the lead developer (J√°nos Korbuly) for of the manufacturer (Weiss Manfr√©d) in the late 80's. The base of the theory was the 2 prototype suspensions of the Tas, jumping to the conclusion that the second one was for a TD. This was later debunked, as army officials actually ordered two full prototypes of the Tas P√°l Korbuly in his research seems to have hinted that there was there was at least some idea based around making a tank destroyer on the 44M Tas chassis but no surviving documentation of this exists and if the idea actually existed it most likely stayed just as an idea and never went anywhere. Hungary had experimented and made self propelled guns and tank destroyers previously so it's not too unlikely that something like the 44M Tas Rohaml√∂veg would have been made eventually if the 44M Tas project got to a more advanced stage.  Speculated design  Basically all design features of the Tas Rohaml√∂veg in the sources about it are 100% made up and based around theories. It has been speculated that it would have been a Hungarian version of the German Jagdpanther as the base vehicle, the 44M Tas, was supposed to be the Hungarian version of the German Panther tank.  Armament  Sources about the Tas Rohaml√∂veg mentions that it would be armed with either a 7.5 cm Kw.K. 42 L/70 or an 8.8 cm Kw.K. 43 L/71, two German guns which the Hungarians did not have access too. The base vehicle, the 44M Tas, was to feature an anti tank gun based on the 80 mm 29/44M. Bofors/DIM√ÅVAG L/58 anti-aircraft gun which was the most powerful anti tank gun the Hungarians had access too. So if the Tas Rohaml√∂veg would have been constructed it would most likely have featured this 80 mm anti tank gun which would have made the entire vehicle just a budget 44M Tas. As for secondary armament such as machine guns there is nothing to base it on. Previous self propelled guns such as the 43M Zr√≠nyi didn't have any machine guns but seeing as times had changed and basically all tank destroyers of the time had secondary armament such as machine guns it's not too unlikely that a Tas Rohaml√∂veg design would have featured machine guns.  Armor  The armor of the Tas Rohaml√∂veg would most likely have been the same as the 44M Tas as this would have made the production easier. The front, if based on the Jagdpanther concept, would have featured the 3 frontal plates of the 44M Tas but with the upper one being elongated to protect the casemate. As for the sides they would too have been elongated where the casemate should be with the back of the casemate being fairly thinly armored as it would most likely have featured doors for entering and loading the vehicle. * Front: 75 mm upper frontal plate, 120 mm upper lower frontal plate, 75 mm lower lower frontal plate. * Sides: 50 mm upper sides plates, 50 mm lower side plates. * Back: 40 mm back casemate plate, 100 mm upper back plate, 75 mm lower back plate. * Roof: 20 mm casemate roof plate, 20 mm frontal deck roof plate, 20 mm back deck plate. * Floor: 20 mm upper chassis floor plate, 20 mm lower chassis floor plate.  Mobility  Considering that if it was based on the Jagdpanther concept and featured the above-mentioned armor and equipment it would most likely weigh about as much as the 44M Tas as the Jagdpanther weighed about as much as the Panther. This would put it at around 36 tons. Its power pack would most defiantly have been the same as the 44M Tas which had two Weiss Manfr√©d V-8H water cooled V8 petrol 260 hp engines which would crank out 520 hp together giving the vehicle a power to weight ratio of around 14 hp per ton. This would have given it basically the same speed as the 44M Tas which was projected at around 45 km/h.

The school serves students from Years 9 to 13 (approx. ages 12 to 18) as of History The school opened in February 1972 as the Waimakariri District's second secondary school, supplementing Rangiora High School 11 km away in Rangiora. Like many New Zealand state secondary schools built in the 1970s, Kaiapoi High School was built to the S68 standard design, characterised by single-storey classroom blocks of masonry construction, low-pitched roofs with protruding clerestory windows, and internal open courtyards. Other schools using this design in the wider Canterbury area include Hornby High School and Ashburton College. Enrolment Kaiapoi High School serves the coastal Waimakariri District, including the towns of Kaiapoi, Woodend, Pegasus, Waikuku, and the surrounding rural area west to Swannanoa. It also serves the rural northeastern part of Christchurch City as far south as the Styx River, including Kainga, Brooklands, Spencerville. At the April 2014 Education Review Office (ERO) review of the school, Kaiapoi High School had 587 students, including 24 international students. There were slightly more male students (51%) than female students. 79% of students identified as New Zealand European (PƒÅkehƒÅ), 14% identified as MƒÅori, and 7% identified as another ethnicity. Kaiapoi High School has a socio-economic decile of 7 (funding step O), meaning it draws its school community from areas of moderately-low socio-economic disadvantage when compared to other New Zealand schools. This changed from decile 5 (funding step M) at the beginning of 2015, as part of the nationwide review of deciles following the following the 2013 census.

The proper choice of array dimensions and analysis techniques can reveal patterns in the underlying data undetected by other methods. History The study of multiway data analysis was first formalized as the result of a conference held in 1988. The result of this conference was the first text specifically addressed to this field, Coppi and Bolasco's Multiway Data Analysis. At that time, the application areas for multiway analysis included statistics, econometrics and psychometrics. In recent years, applications have expanded to include chemometrics, agriculture, social network analysis and the food industry.  Composition of multiway data analysis  Multiway data Multiway data analysts use the term way to refer to a dimension of the data while reserving the word mode for the methods or models used to analyze the data. In this sense, we can define the various ways of data to analyze: * One-way data is a vector, with a single data value for each discrete or continuous value of the single dimension. * Two-way data is a matrix, with a single data value for each discrete or continuous value of two separate dimensions; a spreadsheet can be used to visualize such data in the case of discrete dimensions. * Three-way data can be viewed as a stack of matrices (or similarly, as a workbook of multiple spreadsheets), adding a third dimension. Such data might represent the temperature at different locations (two-way data) sampled over different times (the third dimension, leading to three-way data) * Four-way data, using the same spreadsheet analogy, can be represented as a file folder full of separate workbooks. * Five-way data and six-way data can be represented by similarly higher levels of data aggregation. In general, the several dimensions represented in the data set may be measured at different times, or in different places, using different methodologies, and may contain inconsistencies such as missing data or discrepancies in data representation. Multiway model The multiway model refers to the selection of the number and nature of dimensions used to represent the data available. The ultimate goal is to reduce the multiple dimensions down to one or two (by detecting the patterns within the data) that can then be presented to human decision-makers. Multiway application Multiway data analysis can be employed in various multiway applications so as to address the problem of finding hidden multilinear structure in multiway datasets. Following are examples of applications in different fields: * Computer vision * Electroanalytical chemistry * Neuroscience * Process analysis * Social network analysis/web-mining  Multiway processing  Multiway processing is the execution of designed and determined multiway model(s) transforming multiway data to the desirable level by addressing the specific need of particular multiway application.
