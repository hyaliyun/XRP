It is located on Podgórski Square on the northern slopes of the Krzemionki foothills in the south-central part of the city. History The church was built between 1905 and 1909, and designed by Jan Sas Zubrzycki in the Gothic Revival style. It is the largest church in the area. The exterior of the church The interior of the church is shaped in the likeness of a Gothic cathedral in the so-called Gothic Vistula style. It is filled with numerous altars, benches and other items made mostly of wood. Work on the fittings lasted for years. In the postwar period, the locations of some of the altars and pulpits were changed, as well as a bricked arcade between an ambulatory and the former chapel of the Sacred Heart (now Our Lady of Perpetual Help and Eternal Adoration). The altars created first were the main chapel (in the sanctuary) and the Annunciation (formerly in the right arm of the transept). Work on them was from 1908 to 1909. The main altar originally consisted of the tabernacle and statues of Saint Joseph. In main altar in the west (right) arm of the transept stands the altar of the Annunciation. There are 5 other main altars. Restoration In 1999, the local parish priest, Franciszek Kołacz, decided the church needed restoration. The main altar, side altars, pulpit and organ were renovated. It was also restored to its original colour, which was lost during renovations at the time of pastor Franciszek Mirek, when the colour was changed to red-blue which severely affected the appearance of the church. Today the church has a white-gray colour which has restored it to its former character.

Kissena Creek (also Mill Creek or Ireland Mill Creek) is a buried stream located in the neighborhoods of Flushing, Fresh Meadows, Hillcrest, and Kew Gardens Hills in the New York City borough of Queens. Kissena Creek originates in a now-filled swamp within Kew Gardens Hills and Pomonok in central Queens, flowing east to Hillcrest. The creek then travels mostly north and west, largely flowing beneath Kissena Park Golf Course, Kissena Park, Kissena Corridor Park, and Queens Botanical Garden, before merging with the Flushing River in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park. The name \\"Kissena\\" comes from the Chippewa language term for \\"it is cold\\", \\"cold place\\", or \\"cool water\\". Much of the creek was covered or diverted into sewers in the 20th century, and the only extant above-ground portion of the creek is Kissena Lake in Kissena Park.  Headwaters  The creek, also known historically as Mill Creek or Ireland Mill Creek, begins at what was formerly a swamp in the modern Kew Gardens Hills and Pomonok areas. The swamp was variously known as \\"Peat Bog Swamp\\", \\"Old Crow Swamp\\", \\"Doughty's Swamp\\", and \\"Gutman's Swamp\\". The swamp was bound by Vleigh Place near Main Street to its west, and Kissena Boulevard and Parsons Boulevard to the east. When Parsons and Kissena Boulevards were laid out as the combined \\"Jamaica and Flushing Road\\", the route curved around the north edge of the swamp. The curve later became known as \\"Dead Man's Bend\\", due to the frequent accidents that would appear there, until a bypass was made by extending Kissena Boulevard southeast to Parsons Boulevard. The original alignment between Kissena and Parsons Boulevards remains as the two-block Aguilar Avenue. In the late 19th century, the swamp served as a source for peat, a fossil fuel related to coal that forms from decayed plant matter. As Kew Gardens Hills gradually developed, the swamp shrunk in size with the street grid resting on top of it. The swamp was completely drained by 1918, except for a small section under a barn, whose owner had bought the barn from the city government and moved it to the swamp's \\"easement area\\". The last remaining section of the swamp, covering , remained undeveloped through the end of the 20th century. Lander College for Men was built on the site in 2000, while Opal Apartments was developed in 2004.  Fresh Meadows  Past the swamp, the creek travels east parallel to 72nd Avenue. It turns north in modern Fresh Meadows, at the site of Francis Lewis High School, then travels parallel to today's Utopia Parkway to the modern Kissena Park Golf Course, just south of Flushing Cemetery. The creek runs under Fresh Meadow Lane, which forms the Kissena Park Golf Course's eastern border, and then turns westward underneath the golf course's northern border. A tributary flowed northward from a kettle pond in present-day Utopia Playground and merged with the main creek at Utopia Parkway. The pond was located at the junction of Fresh Meadow Lane and 73rd Avenue, which was known as Black Stump Road. This road took its name from a local landmark along current Fresh Meadows Lane: the remnants of a large tree that had burned after being struck by lightning, and that was known as the \\"Black Stump\\". The kettle pond was infilled in 1941.  Kissena Park  Kissena Lake The creek then turns west and flows into Kissena Lake. Located at the northwestern corner of Kissena Park, Kissena Lake is fed by the creek and was also fed a smaller stream from the north that has since been buried with a playground built on top. In its center is a bird sanctuary isle constructed following the lake's most recent restoration in 2003. The name of the lake, park, and creek comes from the Chippewa language meaning \\"it is cold\\", \\"cold place\\", or \\"cool water\\". The site of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, slightly west of Kissena Park, was originally part of the ancestral path of the Hudson River, and the present-day Kissena Lake was located on the eastern shore of the river. A glacier covered much of Long Island, where Queens is located, and formed a terminal moraine through the center of the island. When the glacier receded, it created several recesses in the land; some of these recesses, such as Kissena Lake, were filled with water. The lake was used as an ice skating and ice harvesting site for much of the 19th century. Its use as a recreational site led the city to purchase land around it for a park in 1906. The glaciation also created a natural source of well water for the area. Originally, the western end of Kissena Lake drained into the creek and was traversed by a bridge, similar to Central Park's Gapstow Bridge. Kissena Lake was dredged in 1942 as part of a Works Progress Administration initiative. This transformed Kissena Lake into a \\"bathtub lake\\" with a concrete shoreline. Prior to the renovation, Kissena Lake was part of a wetland, which was believed to be a worthless type of land during the 20th century. Lacking natural aeration and warmed by its shallower depth and concrete shoreline, the lake suffered a buildup of algae. This necessitated another restoration project, which was undertaken in 1983. In 2003, a $2.3 million restoration drained the lake in stages, resulting in its current appearance. The city water was replaced with well water, an aeration system was installed, the concrete bulkheads were replaced with natural-looking materials such as rocks and plants, and a small island for birds and turtles was built within the lake.  Kissena Corridor Park  Located underneath Kissena Park and the western portion of Kissena Corridor Park is the Kissena Corridor Sewer. The combined sewer receives water from as far east as Little Neck, near New York City's border with Nassau County. It was adapted from the path of Kissena Creek, which had been gradually diverted into the sewer during the mid-20th century. In 1934, the creek was placed in a culvert at its crossing with Main Street (then called Jagger Avenue), as part of a widening project for the street. The Kissena Corridor project was initiated in the 1930s as a greenbelt to link several parks in eastern Queens. It included the construction of a major storm sewer through the corridor, which the Parks Department said was necessitated as a result of \\"the great extent of this natural drainage basin.\\" In 1942, the federal War Production Board barred the construction of the Corridor Sewer, due to steel requirements for the World War II effort. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the sewer project were held on April 1, 1947, at the intersection of Lawrence Street and Fowler and Blossom Avenues, near the modern-day Queens Botanical Garden west of Kissena Park.See: On February 19, 1948, the final contract for the project, including the trunk line from 188th Street to Francis Lewis Boulevard, was authorized from the Board of Estimate. Eight days later, the Queens borough sewer engineer announced that the cost of the sewer project would run to over $10,000,000, $2.25 million higher than the previous figure. The main trunk of the Corridor Sewer was completed by September 1948, although many of the feeder lines had yet to be constructed.See: The western stretch of Kissena Corridor Park was landfilled in the 1950s from dirt excavated for the construction of the Long Island Expressway.See: Prior to the filling operations, the creek was still visible within the western portion of the park, and occasionally caused flooding in the surrounding neighborhoods. By 1960, about of dirt were deposited on the park from the Long Island Expressway. Additionally, in 1959, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses had announced that more fill would come from the Clearview Expressway, which would raise the grade of the park and end garbage landfilling.  Queens Botanical Garden  The sewers from Kissena Corridor Park flow west through the Queens Botanical Garden. From there, the sewers cross College Point Boulevard and enter the Flushing Bay Combined Sewer Outfall (CSO) Retention Facility, located in Flushing Meadows underneath the Al Oerter Recreation Center. The facility can hold up to of water from overflows during storms, before pumping the water to the Tallman Island Waste Water Treatment Plant in College Point. Otherwise, the water empties into the Flushing River (also known as Flushing Creek). The Flushing River flows north into Flushing Bay, part of the East River, which in turn is an arm of the Atlantic Ocean. Formerly, Kissena Creek flowed from the Botanical Garden site directly into Flushing Meadows, merging with the Flushing River near the site of the present-day Fountain of the Planets. Prior to the 1964−1965 New York World's Fair, the western portion of Kissena Corridor Park between Lawrence Street/College Point Boulevard and Main Street adjacent to Flushing Meadows Park was leased to the World's Fair Corporation, along with most of Flushing Meadows. In 1961, as part of $3 million in development for the World's Fair, the Queens Botanical Garden was planned to be relocated from the fair grounds in Flushing Meadows to the west end of Kissena Corridor Park adjacent to the World's Fair Grounds. This site was originally planned to be used as parking space for the fair. Instead, the Queens Botanical Garden was built, and it was dedicated on October 19, 1963. The QBG's 2001 Master Plan included the construction of a self-sustaining ecosystem. The plan consisted of a stream forming from rainwater collected atop the roof of its administration building, flowing through pools towards a wetland at the garden's western edge. Runoff collected in the garden's parking lot and other locations would also contribute to the stream. Part of the stream follows the path of Kissena Creek.

The 10th-century building, Romanesque/Gothic in style, was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural landmark in 1931. History Exterior view (c. 1905) A nunnery was founded by Count Sunyer I and his wife Riquilda Toulouse next to an ancient church dedicated to San Saturnino. The church was consecrated on 16 June 945 by Bishop Guilarà. The first abbess was Adelaide, widow of Sunifredo of Urgel. In 985, the monastery was attacked by the troops of Almanzor. Count Borrell II restored it; the new abbess was Adalet. The monastery grew slowly. At the end of the 10th century, the community was composed of a dozen religious. In the following century, the number rose to 20, most of them daughters of nobles of the time. The powerful religious families were responsible to financially support the monastery. In 1147, a new, larger church, encompassing both the monastery and the old church dedicated to St. Sadurní, was consecrated. The community suffered with the 1835 secularization and the monastery became a prison. In 1879, the religious community moved to a new location in the district of Sarria-Sant Gervasi. In 1873, the cloister and other sections was removed. The monastery suffered a fire in 1909 after which it was rebuilt. A new fire ravaged the building during the Spanish Civil War in 1939. Architecture and fittings Interior view Very little remains of the original building, partly because of destruction and partly because of poor restorations It is known that the cloister contained two floors. The lower style, Romanesque, dates to the 11th century while the upper, Gothic style, was built circa 1322. Some elements have been preserved and are distributed in various museums. The original church was constructed in the Greek cross plan. It was bounded by four arches supported by columns and a domed octagonal base. In the area where the present chapel of the Blessed is located, there are remains of the old church of San Saturnino which predates Sant Pere de les Puelles. The monastery had a bell tower, known as the Torre dels Ocells (Tower of Birds) which was destroyed during the fire of 1909. A bell dating to 1752 is present in the octagonal bell tower, which has six bells total.

Al-Jahith's Treasury or Khizanat al- Jahith () is the collective name for three bookstores in downtown Amman, Jordan, owned by three brothers of the al-Maaytah (Arabic: المعايطة) family of Karak. Four successive generations of this family have operated the bookstore nearly continuously from the last decade of the nineteenth century to the present day, migrating between Karak, Jerusalem, and Amman. The archives of the bookstore are notable for their Arabic religious, scientific and literary manuscripts, the oldest of which dates back to the thirteenth century. In addition, there are newspaper and journal editions from the early 1900s, as well as thousands of rare books that the family obtained at auction from the offices of the British Mandate in Palestine in 1947. Al-Jahith's Treasury was the first bookstore established by a decree of Abdullah I, issued in Qatraneh in 1921 in the course of his consolidation of power leading to his assumption of the Emirate of Transjordan later that year. When Al-Jahith's Treasury moved from Jerusalem to Amman after the 1947–48 war, it became the first lending library in the burgeoning capital city. It remains unique among the bookstores of Amman with its philanthropic mission of accessibility to the poor and lower classes: any book can be exchanged for any other, or rented for one month for one Jordanian dinar. Name The bookstore's name is a reference to the renowned Abbasid writer and theologian, al-Jahith (Arabic: الجاحظ) and to the fact that the residents of Jerusalem took note of the bulging eyes (Arabic: جحوظ) of Mamduh al-Maaytah (the father of the brothers of the present generation). An alternative account is that the grandfather Khalil's overflowing Jerusalem warehouse was frequently compared to that of the original al-Jahith, who, according to legend, perished when his precariously stacked books fell onto his head. History The bookselling profession has passed from father to son in the al-Maaytah family for four generations since the Ottoman period. The bookstore's physical location has moved dozens of times due to the migrations of the family and the upheavals of war. The history of al-Jahith's Treasury, known largely from oral traditions of the Al- Maaytah family and of the inhabitants of Amman, can be divided into four distinct periods. In the first generation, Salman al-Maaytah founded the bookstore, and with him it moved between Karak and Jerusalem, with some stints in Nablus and Hebron. In the second generation, Salman's son Khalil al-Maaytah ran the bookstore in the Old City of Jerusalem from 1922 until his death in 1947. In the third generation, Khalil's son Mamduh al-Maaytah transferred the bookstore from Jerusalem to Amman in 1948, where it became the city's first lending library and a hub of cultural activity. When Mamduh died in 1993, three of his seven sons—Hisham, Hamzeh, and Muhammad—followed in his footsteps and have continued to operate the bookstore. Today, each of the brothers runs a different branch in downtown Amman. Karak and early British-Administered Jerusalem (ca. 1890–1921) The great-grandfather of the present generation was Salman al-Maaytah al-Tamimi. Himself belonging to a lineage of scribes and book traders, he is credited with founding the first incarnation of what would become al-Jahith's Treasury in Karak in the 1890s, where it was known as Maṣṭabat al-Karak (the Gathering-Place of Karak). In those days, he would migrate with the rest of the al-Maaytah clan between Karak, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Hebron. He brought his books with him on these migrations, and he eventually settled in Jerusalem, where the bookstore became known as Maktabat Ḥā'iṭ al-Burāq (Bookstore of the Wall of Buraq) due to its location near the Wall of Buraq. Salman's son Khalil, who fought in the Great Arab Revolt during World War I, inherited the trade when his father died. Mandatory Palestine (1921–1947) Jerusalem rooftops after the rare snowstorm of 1921. According to al-Maaytah family tradition, Khalil re-established the bookstore in Jerusalem in one of the snowiest winters in recent memory. In early 1921, Khalil and his maternal uncle were among the sheikhs of Karak who pledged their loyalty to Abdullah I at Qatraneh, on his way from Ma'an to Amman. It was in Qatraneh at this time that Abdullah I issued a royal license for the establishment of a bookstore in the Emirate. That same winter, Khalil re- established the bookstore in the Old City of Jerusalem. It was located near the Damascus Gate, and it was known as Ṣā' Khalīl al-Raḥmān, or the \\"Chamber of Abraham\\", based on the patriarch's Qur'anic epithet as the beloved friend (Khalīl) of God (al-Raḥmān). Khalil continued in the antiquarian book trade for the next 25 years, most notably acquiring thousands of rare books and manuscripts from the offices of the British Mandate shortly before its disintegration in 1947. Throughout this period, his store became a center of Sufi life in Jerusalem. When hostilities broke out in the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, the bookstore was burnt in its entirety, and the only books and manuscripts that survived were those that Khalil had stored in his home instead of the bookstore—including the lion's share of the British Mandate material. As a militia volunteer, Khalil was killed in a battle between Arab and Jewish forces near al-Eizariya in 1947. Establishment in Amman (1948–1993) Khalil's son Mamduh was born in Karak in 1930 and attended school through sixth grade before becoming an apprentice to his father. Later, he would become an autodidact, teaching himself English and Turkish and acquiring a name as a respected poet. He entered the Jordanian military and fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. He was wounded in a land mine explosion in the vicinity of Qalandia and as a consequence his leg had to be amputated. He moved briefly to Beirut for his convalescence. In 1948, Mamduh returned to Amman with the books that he had inherited. Like his father before him, he took advantage of King Abdullah I's royal licence for the Al- Maaytah family to set up a bookstore. At that time, there was no public library system in Jordan. From the beginning, Mamduh saw the mission of al- Jahith's Treasury to be the free spread of knowledge, even among those who could not afford to buy books, so he turned the store into a lending library and advertised it as such. Any book could be borrowed for a month for a token sum, and any book could be exchanged for another. Al-Jahith's Treasury went through a series of peregrinations due to economic pressures and orders from the municipality. The first location was near the Yemeni market; from there, Mamduh moved to the vicinity of the Arab Bank next to Abu Seer Sweets; from there, he moved to a location abutting the Roman Nymphaeum (where Hamzeh's branch remains to this day), and, finally, he set up a kiosk on the corner of Basman Street, across from the Central Post Office and Hashim Restaurant (where Hisham's branch remains to this day). Both in Mamduh's tenure and in recent years, the municipality and developers have attempted to shut down the store but failed in the face of public outcry. Mamduh developed connections between Al-Jahith's Treasury and the University of Jordan and Al al-Bayt University, which have benefited from the loan of rare manuscripts from the Al-Maaytahs, for the purpose of research, display in exhibits, and editing for publication. Mamduh Al-Maaytah passed away in 1993 and bequeathed the bookstore to his seven children, three of whom—Hisham, Hamzeh, and Muhammad—have continued in his footsteps and carried on the legacy of Al- Jahith's Treasury. The Current Generation (1993–present) The Central Post Office branch of al-Jahith's Treasury, owned and operated by Hisham al- Maaytah As of January 2017, al-Jahith's Treasury consists of three branches in downtown Amman, each branch owned and managed by a different son of Mamduh Al- Maaytah. The most central and best-recognized of the three is Hisham's kiosk across from the Central Post Office (). Hamzeh's branch is located in the nook behind the Roman Nymphaeum on Quraysh Street (), and Muhammad's stand is adjacent to the Roman Amphitheater (). In the summer of 2016, Hamzeh Al- Maaytah renamed his branch al-Maa (\\"Water\\") Bookstore. The current generation has carried on Mamduh's mission to make knowledge accessible to all people, regardless of ability to pay. The stores' central location on the streets of downtown Amman—and the 24/7 opening hours of al-Maa Bookstore—enables people to take advantage of the book-lending and exchanging programs daily. In March 2016, Hamzeh inaugurated a new initiative for al-Maa Bookstore called \\"Take a book and read / Pay any price you please\\" (Arabic: خذ كتاب تستفيد / ادفع كما تريد), with a week-long book fair in the city of Madaba., and he has carried out six other book fairs in schools and municipalities in different towns in Jordan. In March 2017, al-Maa Bookstore (Hamzeh's branch) was at risk of closing, and the Jordanian and international allies of al-Maa Bookstore launched a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo to save it. Hisham Al-Maaytah was killed in a car accident on March 3, 2018. Jordan’s King Abdullah II attended the wake in Karak and paid his respects to the Al-Maaytah family.

It contains the local Sundby Library as well as other facilities for the local community. History The warehouse was built for Lauritz Peter Holmblad in association with his oil mill which is still located next to the building. Holmblad had previously owned a stud farm on the site (Jemtelandsgadewas 1). The warehouse was designed by Georg Ebbe Wineken Møller , built by Christian Peter Wienberg and inaugurated on 24 November 1880.

Her father, whose personal name was Shilu (室魯)History of Liao, vol. 71. or Dilu (敵魯)History of Liao, vol. 73. Dilu was not directly referred to as her father, but as her brother Xiao Han was described to be Dilu's son, it was probable that Shilu and Dilu were the same person. and who was probably still using the surname Shulü (述律) at the time that she was born, was a younger brother of Empress Shulü Ping, the wife of Liao's founder Emperor Taizu of Liao. (Xiao Wen's older brother Xiao Han was described by the Song Dynasty historian Sima Guang, in his Zizhi Tongjian, as the first member of the Shulü household to use the name of Xiao, although it is not clear whether Sima's assertion was actually correct;Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. the History of Liao explained that because Emperor Taizu admired Han Dynasty's founder Emperor Gao (Liu Bang), he had his own Yelü clan take on the Han Chinese surname of Liu, while having the clans of past and present consorts of Yelü chieftains take on the surname of Xiao, after Emperor Gao's prime minister Xiao He; based on Liao tradition, nearly all of the subsequent empresses of Liao carried the surname of Xiao.) Xiao Wen married Emperor Taizu's and Empress Shulü's second son Yelü Deguang while Yelü Deguang carried the title of Generalissimo. (As Yelü Deguang was bestowed that title in 923, their marriage thus would be that year or later, but before Emperor Taizu's death in 926.)History of Liao, vol. 2.  As empress  After Emperor Taizu's death in 926, Yelü Deguang succeeded to the throne in 927 (as Emperor Taizong), bypassing his older brother Yelü Bei. The new emperor created Xiao Wen empress shortly thereafter. Empress Xiao was described to be intelligent, virtuous, and frugal. She was much favored by Emperor Taizong, such that she accompanied him on campaigns and hunts. She gave birth to his first son Yelü Jing in 931. Around the new year 935, she gave birth to his second son Yelü Yanchege (耶律罨撤葛), and thereafter fell gravely ill. She died a month later. She was initially given the posthumous name of Zhangde (彰德, “displayed virtue\\"); her eventually posthumous name of Jing'an was given by Emperor Xingzong.

One such example is \\\\ell_1 regularization (also known as Lasso) of the form :\\\\min_{w\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2+ \\\\lambda \\\\w\\\\_1, \\\\quad \\\\text{ where } x_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\text{ and } y_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. Proximal gradient methods offer a general framework for solving regularization problems from statistical learning theory with penalties that are tailored to a specific problem application. Such customized penalties can help to induce certain structure in problem solutions, such as sparsity (in the case of lasso) or group structure (in the case of group lasso).  Relevant background  Proximal gradient methods are applicable in a wide variety of scenarios for solving convex optimization problems of the form : \\\\min_{x\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}} F(x)+R(x), where F is convex and differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradient, R is a convex, lower semicontinuous function which is possibly nondifferentiable, and \\\\mathcal{H} is some set, typically a Hilbert space. The usual criterion of x minimizes F(x)+R(x) if and only if abla (F+R)(x) = 0 in the convex, differentiable setting is now replaced by : 0\\\\in \\\\partial (F+R)(x), where \\\\partial \\\\varphi denotes the subdifferential of a real- valued, convex function \\\\varphi. Given a convex function \\\\varphi:\\\\mathcal{H} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} an important operator to consider is its proximity operator \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\varphi}:\\\\mathcal{H}\\\\to\\\\mathcal{H} defined by : \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\varphi}(u) = \\\\operatorname{arg}\\\\min_{x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}} \\\\varphi(x)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\u-x\\\\_2^2, which is well-defined because of the strict convexity of the \\\\ell_2 norm. The proximity operator can be seen as a generalization of a projection. We see that the proximity operator is important because x^* is a minimizer to the problem \\\\min_{x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{H}} F(x)+R(x) if and only if :x^* = \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma R}\\\\left(x^*-\\\\gamma abla F(x^*)\\\\right), where \\\\gamma>0 is any positive real number.  Moreau decomposition  One important technique related to proximal gradient methods is the Moreau decomposition, which decomposes the identity operator as the sum of two proximity operators. Namely, let \\\\varphi:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} be a lower semicontinuous, convex function on a vector space \\\\mathcal{X}. We define its Fenchel conjugate \\\\varphi^*:\\\\mathcal{X}\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} to be the function :\\\\varphi^*(u) := \\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X}} \\\\langle x,u\\\\rangle - \\\\varphi(x). The general form of Moreau's decomposition states that for any x\\\\in\\\\mathcal{X} and any \\\\gamma>0 that :x = \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma \\\\varphi}(x) + \\\\gamma\\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\varphi^*/\\\\gamma}(x/\\\\gamma), which for \\\\gamma=1 implies that x = \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\varphi}(x)+\\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\varphi^*}(x). The Moreau decomposition can be seen to be a generalization of the usual orthogonal decomposition of a vector space, analogous with the fact that proximity operators are generalizations of projections. In certain situations it may be easier to compute the proximity operator for the conjugate \\\\varphi^* instead of the function \\\\varphi, and therefore the Moreau decomposition can be applied. This is the case for group lasso.  Lasso regularization  Consider the regularized empirical risk minimization problem with square loss and with the \\\\ell_1 norm as the regularization penalty: :\\\\min_{w\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2+ \\\\lambda \\\\w\\\\_1, where x_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\text{ and } y_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. The \\\\ell_1 regularization problem is sometimes referred to as lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator). Such \\\\ell_1 regularization problems are interesting because they induce sparse solutions, that is, solutions w to the minimization problem have relatively few nonzero components. Lasso can be seen to be a convex relaxation of the non-convex problem :\\\\min_{w\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2+ \\\\lambda \\\\w\\\\_0, where \\\\w\\\\_0 denotes the \\\\ell_0 \\"norm\\", which is the number of nonzero entries of the vector w. Sparse solutions are of particular interest in learning theory for interpretability of results: a sparse solution can identify a small number of important factors.  Solving for \\\\ell_1 proximity operator  For simplicity we restrict our attention to the problem where \\\\lambda=1. To solve the problem :\\\\min_{w\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2+ \\\\w\\\\_1, we consider our objective function in two parts: a convex, differentiable term F(w) = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2 and a convex function R(w) = \\\\w\\\\_1. Note that R is not strictly convex. Let us compute the proximity operator for R(w). First we find an alternative characterization of the proximity operator \\\\operatorname{prox}_{R}(x) as follows: \\\\begin{align} u = \\\\operatorname{prox}_R(x) \\\\iff & 0\\\\in \\\\partial \\\\left(R(u)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\u-x\\\\_2^2\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\iff & 0\\\\in \\\\partial R(u) + u-x\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\iff & x-u\\\\in \\\\partial R(u). \\\\end{align} For R(w) = \\\\w\\\\_1 it is easy to compute \\\\partial R(w): the ith entry of \\\\partial R(w) is precisely : \\\\partial w_i = \\\\begin{cases} 1,&w;_i>0\\\\\\\\\\\\ -1,&w;_i<0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left[-1,1\\\\right],&w;_i = 0. \\\\end{cases} Using the recharacterization of the proximity operator given above, for the choice of R(w) = \\\\w\\\\_1 and \\\\gamma>0 we have that \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma R}(x) is defined entrywise by ::\\\\left(\\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma R}(x)\\\\right)_i = \\\\begin{cases} x_i-\\\\gamma,&x;_i>\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0,&x_i\\\\leq\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_i+\\\\gamma,&x;_i<-\\\\gamma, \\\\end{cases} which is known as the soft thresholding operator S_{\\\\gamma}(x)=\\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma \\\\\\\\cdot\\\\_1}(x).  Fixed point iterative schemes  To finally solve the lasso problem we consider the fixed point equation shown earlier: :x^* = \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma R}\\\\left(x^*-\\\\gamma abla F(x^*)\\\\right). Given that we have computed the form of the proximity operator explicitly, then we can define a standard fixed point iteration procedure. Namely, fix some initial w^0\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d, and for k=1,2,\\\\ldots define :w^{k+1} = S_{\\\\gamma}\\\\left(w^k - \\\\gamma abla F\\\\left(w^k\\\\right)\\\\right). Note here the effective trade-off between the empirical error term F(w) and the regularization penalty R(w). This fixed point method has decoupled the effect of the two different convex functions which comprise the objective function into a gradient descent step ( w^k - \\\\gamma abla F\\\\left(w^k\\\\right)) and a soft thresholding step (via S_\\\\gamma). Convergence of this fixed point scheme is well-studied in the literature and is guaranteed under appropriate choice of step size \\\\gamma and loss function (such as the square loss taken here). Accelerated methods were introduced by Nesterov in 1983 which improve the rate of convergence under certain regularity assumptions on F. Such methods have been studied extensively in previous years. For more general learning problems where the proximity operator cannot be computed explicitly for some regularization term R, such fixed point schemes can still be carried out using approximations to both the gradient and the proximity operator.  Practical considerations  There have been numerous developments within the past decade in convex optimization techniques which have influenced the application of proximal gradient methods in statistical learning theory. Here we survey a few important topics which can greatly improve practical algorithmic performance of these methods.  Adaptive step size  In the fixed point iteration scheme :w^{k+1} = \\\\operatorname{prox}_{\\\\gamma R}\\\\left(w^k-\\\\gamma abla F\\\\left(w^k\\\\right)\\\\right), one can allow variable step size \\\\gamma_k instead of a constant \\\\gamma. Numerous adaptive step size schemes have been proposed throughout the literature. Applications of these schemes suggest that these can offer substantial improvement in number of iterations required for fixed point convergence.  Elastic net (mixed norm regularization)  Elastic net regularization offers an alternative to pure \\\\ell_1 regularization. The problem of lasso (\\\\ell_1) regularization involves the penalty term R(w) = \\\\w\\\\_1, which is not strictly convex. Hence, solutions to \\\\min_w F(w) + R(w), where F is some empirical loss function, need not be unique. This is often avoided by the inclusion of an additional strictly convex term, such as an \\\\ell_2 norm regularization penalty. For example, one can consider the problem :\\\\min_{w\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}^d} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i- \\\\langle w,x_i\\\\rangle)^2+ \\\\lambda \\\\left((1-\\\\mu)\\\\w\\\\_1+\\\\mu \\\\w\\\\_2^2\\\\right), where x_i\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\text{ and } y_i\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. For 0<\\\\mu\\\\leq 1 the penalty term \\\\lambda \\\\left((1-\\\\mu)\\\\w\\\\_1+\\\\mu \\\\w\\\\_2^2\\\\right) is now strictly convex, and hence the minimization problem now admits a unique solution. It has been observed that for sufficiently small \\\\mu > 0, the additional penalty term \\\\mu \\\\w\\\\_2^2 acts as a preconditioner and can substantially improve convergence while not adversely affecting the sparsity of solutions.  Exploiting group structure  Proximal gradient methods provide a general framework which is applicable to a wide variety of problems in statistical learning theory. Certain problems in learning can often involve data which has additional structure that is known a priori. In the past several years there have been new developments which incorporate information about group structure to provide methods which are tailored to different applications. Here we survey a few such methods.  Group lasso  Group lasso is a generalization of the lasso method when features are grouped into disjoint blocks. Suppose the features are grouped into blocks \\\\\\\\{w_1,\\\\ldots,w_G\\\\\\\\}. Here we take as a regularization penalty :R(w) =\\\\sum_{g=1}^G \\\\w_g\\\\_2, which is the sum of the \\\\ell_2 norm on corresponding feature vectors for the different groups. A similar proximity operator analysis as above can be used to compute the proximity operator for this penalty. Where the lasso penalty has a proximity operator which is soft thresholding on each individual component, the proximity operator for the group lasso is soft thresholding on each group. For the group w_g we have that proximity operator of \\\\lambda\\\\gamma\\\\left(\\\\sum_{g=1}^G \\\\w_g\\\\_2\\\\right) is given by :\\\\widetilde{S}_{\\\\lambda\\\\gamma }(w_g) = \\\\begin{cases} w_g-\\\\lambda\\\\gamma \\\\frac{w_g}{\\\\w_g\\\\_2}, & \\\\w_g\\\\_2>\\\\lambda\\\\gamma \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\w_g\\\\_2\\\\leq \\\\lambda\\\\gamma \\\\end{cases} where w_g is the gth group. In contrast to lasso, the derivation of the proximity operator for group lasso relies on the Moreau decomposition. Here the proximity operator of the conjugate of the group lasso penalty becomes a projection onto the ball of a dual norm.  Other group structures  In contrast to the group lasso problem, where features are grouped into disjoint blocks, it may be the case that grouped features are overlapping or have a nested structure. Such generalizations of group lasso have been considered in a variety of contexts. For overlapping groups one common approach is known as latent group lasso which introduces latent variables to account for overlap. Nested group structures are studied in hierarchical structure prediction and with directed acyclic graphs.

Quastler (born December 26, 1940) is an American historical transportation geographer and an authority on aspects of regional transportation systems in the United States. He is Emeritus Professor of Geography in the Department of Geography at San Diego State University. He writes professionally under the name I. E. Quastler. Early life In mid-1939 Quastler's parents and sister moved from Germany to Japan, taking one of the last passenger ships that left an Italian port for East Asia before World War II broke out. They were among those fleeing Germany as non-Aryans were being forced out of their jobs and some were being sent off to concentration camps. Before departing Germany, Quastler's father had found a job with a German engineering company in Japan. Quastler was born in Tokyo on December 26, 1940. As the Allies advanced on Japan in 1944, Quastler and his mother and sister were relocated to the mountain village of Karuizawa, about 80 miles west of Tokyo, which served as a detention area for foreigners. His father, employed in the war industry, remained in Tokyo. After the war, Quastler's father worked for the American occupation administration. The family relocated to the United States in 1951, eventually settling in Detroit where Quastler's father began a new career with Excello Corporation and eventually with General Motors. Education and career Quastler obtained a B.A. degree from Wayne State University in Detroit in 1962. He earned an M.A. degree from Northwestern University in 1964, where he studied under William Garrison, a transportation geographer and a leader of the \\"quantitative revolution\\" that swept geography and other fields in the mid-twentieth century.Barnes, Trevor J. \\"Retheorizing Economic Geography: From the Quantitative Revolution to the 'Cultural Turn',\\" Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 91, No. 3 (September 2001), pp.546-565. While at Northwestern, he began specializing in transportation geography, but of the non-quantitative variety. In 1971, he received his Ph.D. in geography from the University of Kansas, writing a dissertation on an historical geography topic. While in the doctoral program at the University of Kansas, Quastler found that the history of railroad networks was under-studied, leaving an important part of the nation's economy poorly understood in terms of operations, equipment, and network expansion and contraction. Research eventually led to publication of The Railroads of Lawrence, Kansas, 1854-1900 in 1979, followed by eight other books on railroad historical geography. Quastler joined the faculty of San Diego State University in 1968, remaining there until his retirement in 2002. Over the course of his academic career, he developed undergraduate and graduate level courses in transportation, urban and historical geography. His research interests included the history and development of both regional railroads and commuter (regional) airlines. Since his retirement he has continued writing and publishing on those subjects. Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Train upon Arrival in San Diego, 1967 Quastler was a popular teacher who mentored many students over the course of his career. He received the Outstanding Teacher Award at San Diego State University in 1987, and he was twice selected as Exemplary Academic Advisor at the university. Contribution to historical transportation geography Quastler is one of the few academic geographers to extensively study the historical development of railroad and airline transportation networks. Much of the work in the field has been accomplished by non-academic writers and railroad or airline aficionados. Quastler's career has centered on documentation of the development and operation of regional transportation systems, an area generally without rigorous academic work. Besides writing about those forms of transportation, he also photographed them for historical purposes, starting in the late 1950s. He has photographed hundreds of railroads and airlines, producing one of the largest collection of images of this type from the late 1960s to the present. Additionally, he has mapped the networks of the railroads and airlines he has studied, illustrating and explaining their changes over time. In 2010 San Diego Aerospace Museum scanned 355 images from among of his extensive collection of airliner slides, making them available to the public through Flicker. Cherokee Airline Skyvan N3419 in San Diego, 1969 Quastler's study of regional transportation systems expanded to include commuter and regional airlines in 1968, shortly after he arrived at San Diego State College (later San Diego State University). His first book documented the rise of Swift Aire Lines, which at the time served such cities as San Luis Obispo, Santa Maria, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. This was the first in depth study of such airlines. During the 1970s and 1980s, Quastler documented the rise of several other commuter and regional airline networks, including Air Midwest and Scheduled Skyways. Quastler is currently conducting research for a book about the history and historical geography of Pacific Southwest Airlines, the California firm that was one of the most successful intrastate airlines in the history of the industry. In 1994, Quastler completed Commuter Airlines of the United States, co-authored with R. E. G. Davies (1921-2011), a well-known writer of airline history. The book was sponsored and published by the Smithsonian Institution, and it remains the only comprehensive history written on the commuter airline industry. U. S. Commuter Airline Network in 1968 Publications Imre E. Quastler has published seventeen books and monographs and he has written twenty professional articles, reviews, and book chapters. Among his articles, he feels that those published by the journal Kansas History are his most important. Quastler's latest book is Unusual Airlines and Airliners: A Photo Journal. The author describes the book as consisting “primarily of more than 200 unusual airline and airliner photos taken by the author since 1969. The subjects range from commuter airliners, often photographed at unusual locations, to jumbo jets. They also range from airlines and services that lasted only a matter of months, to those of longer standing but which are probably unfamiliar to the average reader, whether in the United States, Canada, or elsewhere. Short essays describe the content and setting of each photograph.”Quastler, I., Unusual Airlines, back cover. *Unusual Airlines and Airliners: A Photo Journal.

It is operated by a diesel powered Tilt Train that runs five times a week on the North Coast line between Brisbane and Cairns, a distance of 1,681 kilometres. At the start of 2015, it replaced the diesel-hauled train The Sunlander. History In October 2010, the Queensland Government awarded a contract to Downer Rail for the construction of a new Tilt Train. The two existing diesel tilt trains used on the Cairns service were also refurbished and extended in size, with the inclusion of first-class sleeping carriages.World class trains for Queensland supporting 800 Maryborough jobs Minister for Transport 27 October 2010 Known as the 'Sunlander 14' project, a total of 25 carriages would have been acquired: * two new power cars and 12 new carriages to create a third train set. * one spare power car (later two), * 10 new carriages to expand the two existing train sets to a 14-car consist, * refurbishment of 14 existing carriages from the existing train sets By expanding the train length from nine to 14 carriages, three 'luxury' sleeping carriages, one 'first-class' lounge and one restaurant car could be included in the consist, replicating the services provided on The Sunlander. The construction of four new power cars allowed for the inclusion of the most up- to-date safety features in the driving car of each train, as well as minimising the risk of disruptions in the event that an incident occurred while a second power car was undergoing heavy maintenance. The resulting project was costed at $195 million and allowed for the operation of five services a week, with a total capacity of 1320 seats. However, costs had risen by 2012, and the Queensland Auditor-General reported that the eventual cost would be from $358 to $404 million, because Queensland Rail had failed to take into account the requirement for upgraded maintenance facilities, as well as en route provisioning. The Auditor-General also believed Queensland Rail had overestimated how popular the new service would be, and had a mistaken belief that the 'luxury' component of the train would attract more high-paying customers. In 2013, the project was scaled back, with the train length being reduced to nine cars by removing the luxury sleepers and restaurant cars. That resulted in a revised project cost of $204 million. In October 2013, the first refurbished Tilt Train entered service on the existing Brisbane to Cairns service.\\"Spirit of Queensland tilt train service commences\\" Railway Digest December 2013 page 16 With the introduction of the Tilt Train, which has a maximum speed of 160 km/h, the journey time was reduced to 24 hours 55 minutes.Spirit of Queensland factsheet Queensland Rail  Rolling stock  Spirit of Queensland at Gordonvale, 2016 Each Spirit of Queensland train consists of: * two power cars to drive the train and supply power to the carriages, * two 'railbed' sleeper cars with airline style lie-flat seating, * three premium economy sitting cars, * one luggage / staff carriage, * one lounge / galley / club car.

Personal life Betty Gram participated in landmark events of the women's rights movement in the early to mid-twentieth century. She joined the women’s rights movement in 1917 and was subsequently jailed five times and went on two hunger strikes. When she was sent to Tennessee to push for the last vote needed to ratify the 19th amendment, a local newspaper announced, “110 Pounds of Femininity Hit Memphis”. Contemporary newspaper accounts often noted her attractiveness. She remained active for many decades in women’s rights and other causes. In 1921, Gram married well-known radio commentator Raymond Gram Swing. She insisted that he take her last name as well if she was taking his and became Betty Gram Swing. The couple were the parents of two sons and a daughter. They divorced in 1944. Suffrage Activity, 1917-1919 National Woman's Party members picketing the Republican convention, Chicago, June 1920. L-R Abby Scott Baker, Florence Taylor Marsh, Sue Shelton White, Elsie Hill, Betty Gram. After graduating from the University of Oregon, Betty Gram embarked on a stage career, which she left when she came east to join the National Woman's Party (NWP), led by Alice Paul. The NWP had split with other women's suffrage groups over its focus on a constitutional amendment guaranteeing women the right to vote, as well as on its aggressive tactics. Other groups, namely the National American Woman's Suffrage Association, had built a state by state suffrage strategy and opposed the NWP's targeting of President Wilson and Democrats as well as its picketing effort.Jailed for Freedom, Doris Stevens The National Woman's Party began its picketing of the White House in January 1917. In March of that year, over one thousand women took part. By June, the White House decided to arrest the picketers. Since holding signs is not illegal, the women demanded to know the reason for their arrest. The eventual charge was obstructing traffic. Those charges were dismissed and no trial was held. But a new pattern had begun - the women picketers were not deterred. Upon their release, they went straight back to picketing the White House and were arrested again. A front page photo in the Evening Tribune of San Diego bore the caption, \\"Washington has found that the only way to keep a picket away from the White House is to put her in jail.\\"Evening Tribune, San Diego, November 24, 1917 This time the picketers were found guilty of obstructing traffic and fined $25 or 3 days in jail. The women refused to pay the fine. A rapid escalation followed until the leader of the NWP, Alice Paul was sentenced to 7 months in jail. Betty and her sister, Alice Gram, and 39 others were jailed for obstructing traffic on November 10, 1917; that picket was part of a protest of Alice Paul's sentence. The charge of obstructing traffic was widely understood as a sham - the Oregonian newspaper clearly stated as much in an article covering the Gram sisters' arrest.The Oregonian, November 15, 1917 In the same article, Betty was quoted as saying, \\"I am going to prison for the suffrage case, with the full knowledge that I have committed no offense.\\" Instead of being sent to the local jail, the November 10th picketers were sent to the Occoquan Workhouse in Virginia, where the inmates were forced to do prison labor. Horrible conditions faced the women in the workhouse - they were beaten, kept in isolation, and given rancid food. After being refused recognition as political prisoners, the women declared a hunger strike. The leaders of the NWP, including Alice Paul, were force fed. The Gram sisters were released after 17 days in jail, along with 22 other hunger strikers, although they had been sentenced to 30 days. The arrests and hunger strike were widely covered in newspapers across the country and Betty was featured prominently. The Oregonian noted that, by the time they were released, Betty and Alice had lost 12 and 19 lbs respectively.The Oregonian, November 24, 1917 But their arrests and ill-treatment did not deter the Grams or the other picketers, who continue pressuring President Wilson and Congress to take up a constitutional amendment granting women the right to vote. In January 1919, Betty Gram was one of two sentries outside the White House standing guard over a bonfire in which they burned President Wilson's speeches.Miami District Daily News, January 10, 1919 The next month she was arrested in Boston when 21 members of the National Woman's Party gathered in front of the State House with suffrage banners. They were there to protest President Wilson's arrival in Boston. The women were arrested when they refused to comply with police orders to move. In newspaper accounts, Betty was singled out as resisting arrest and had to be \\"lifted bodily\\" into the police wagon.Salt Lake Telegram (AP story), February 24, 1919 Ratification Efforts After multiple attempts through 1918 and the beginning of 1919, on June 4, 1919, Congress finally passed the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to vote, pending ratification by the states. Betty Gram and the National Woman's Party quickly shifted their efforts from the White House to the states. Betty became a leader in the ratification campaign, working in New Jersey, Massachusetts, Delaware, West Virginia, Tennessee, and other states. In January 1920, suffragists defeated a New Jersey referendum movement that would have put the question of ratification directly to voters.Trenton Evening Times, January 1, 1920 Delaware became an important battleground state, with an active anti-suffrage movement. According to the Boston Herald, the NWP sent its \\"most experienced ratification campaigners\\" there, including Betty Gram.Boston Herald, March 15, 1920 In June 1920, suffragists picketed the Republican National Convention in Chicago, hoping to pressure the Republican legislature of Delaware and Republican governors of Connecticut and Vermont for their failure to ratify the amendment. The Cleveland Plain Dealer, covering the convention, described Betty Gram as \\"young, vivacious, and pretty\\" and referenced the miniature steel jail door she wore as a breast pin, symbolizing her time in jail for the cause of women's suffrage.Cleveland Plain Dealer, June 9, 1920 The NWP did not picket the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. In July 1920, Betty Gram was on her way to Tennessee to capture the 36th, and last, state needed for ratification. Her hometown paper, the Oregonian, interviewed her on her work to get women the right to vote. Betty said, \\"I joined the picket group because I realized suffrage was at a standstill and unless something dramatic was done, nothing could be accomplished.\\".The Oregonian, July 9, 1920 On August 18, 1920, Tennessee became the 36th state to ratify the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. The long battle was won. Post-Suffrage Having finally succeeded in their years-long effort, the National Woman's Party and other women's groups had to reconsider the makeup and mission of their organizations. In addition, the NWP lost some members as women focused on their careers or other causes. Still others \\"found that marriage and family responsibilities at least temporarily curtailed their NWP activities.\\"Becker, Susan. The Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment Shortly after the ratification of the 19th amendment, Betty Gram set off for Europe to resume her music studies. After marrying Raymond Swing in 1921, her husband's career as a radio commentator and foreign correspondent took them to England, where they lived for over a decade. Now Betty Gram Swing, Betty continued her work for women's rights in the UK and in the international arena. A Rift Even with the right to vote, there were many other barriers to the full participation of women in business and society. The NWP, the League of Women Voters, the Business and Professional Women, the Women's Trade Union League and other groups all worked to improve women's lives, but they had very different philosophies and approaches. The NWP faction are referred to as \\"equalitarian feminists\\", because they adopted a platform of equal rights for women, as opposed to the \\"social feminists\\" who supported a broader set of humanitarian social reforms, including child labor laws and protectionist legislation such as limiting a woman's work week, prohibiting night work for women, and a minimum wage for women and children. There were other legal issues facing women as well, such as the right to serve on a jury, equal rights of inheritance and property ownership, and questions of a married woman's citizenship independent of her husband's. However, like the fight for suffrage, much disagreement remained among the various feminist groups as to the best way to achieve economic opportunity or economic independence for women. An essential element of this rift concerned employment rights for married women, specifically labor laws protecting women versus NWP's “equality” argument. The NWP was against protectionist legislation, arguing it hurt women in the workplace by causing employers not to hire them. As historian Susan Becker describes the feminist movement in the 1920s and 1930s the NWP \\"stood alone throughout these two decades in its single-minded dedication to obtaining legal equality between men and women.\\" Becker, Susan, Origins of the Equal Rights Amendment Equal Rights In 1926, Betty Gram Swing, along with two other American members of the NWP, formed an English outpost of the group in order to aid British feminists in their efforts to repeal the laws limiting women's voting rights to women over the age of 30.Seattle Daily Times, December 7, 1926 Having also fought (and picketed) for equal pay for women and married women's employment rights during her years in England, Betty Gram Swing returned to the United States in 1934. In the fall of that year, she gave a speech to the Inter-American Commission of Woman at the Pan-American Union warning that women would lose their hard-earned rights unless they were ready to fight for them. A Washington Post article covering the speech described Betty as one of \\"the youngest and most beautiful leaders in international feminism.\\"Washington Post, November 12, 1934 The article notes that Betty was focused at that time on having the Equal Rights Treaty \\"ratified and adhered to by all nations.\\" Amendment and Treaty In the post-suffrage time period, American women's groups divided their attention between new legislative agendas, the Equal Rights Amendment (either supporting or opposing it) and the growing focus on international women's issues, highlighted by the NWP's efforts to lobby for approval of the Equal Rights Treaty, which was modeled on the Equal Rights Amendment but was intended as an international document to be ratified by nations. In the 1930s both equalitarian and social feminist agendas were hampered by the Great Depression and the rise of fascism. The NWP drafted the first version of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1921 and it provoked disputes almost immediately, even before it was introduced in Congress in 1923. It was addressed in Congressional subcommittees throughout the 1920s and 1930s but was not reported out until 1936. Hearings and committee reports followed into the 1940s, with the League of Women Voters and other social feminist groups consistently opposing it. At the same time, the NWP was working internationally on the Treaty, which was presented to the Sixth Pan American conference in 1928 and, unofficially, at international talks in Paris. (With shades of their picketing days, Betty Gram Swing, NWP veteran Doris Stevens, and a few others attempted to present the Equal Rights Treaty to President Gaston Doumergue of France, while he was hosting negotiations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. They were refused entry and when they refused to leave the gates, they were held in custody for a few hours.) Even though the United States was not a member of the League of Nations, the NWP focused its Treaty efforts there, using its relationships with Latin American women's groups for support. Again, social feminists opposed the Treaty because of they believed it would undermine international protectionist labor laws benefitting women. Ultimately, the League of Nations reported the Treaty back to national governments, women's groups, and the International Labor Office, which was a social feminist organization. With the NWP excluded from the decision-making, in 1938 Alice Paul formed the World Women's Party with European equalitarian feminists but the organization was unable to make great strides in the near-term because of the outbreak of World War II. The Post-War Period and International Women's Rights The post- war battles between women’s groups resolved themselves along the same lines as the pre-war battles, with the NWP and equalitarians on one side and social feminists on the other. This time, they would battle over the establishment of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. NWP's position as a strong backer of a UN Commission placed it at odds with other groups, including the League of Women Voters. In 1946, Betty was in London as a National Woman's Party representative to the World Women’s Party along with British feminist Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. The NWP supported international efforts like creating a UN commission on women partly in the hope that it would secure the ERA at home. Others opposed those efforts for the same reason. Eleanor Roosevelt, who was anti-ERA and viewed as an opponent of the NWP, was a representative to the UN Conference. These disputes left American women on the sidelines to some extent and the effort to create a UN commission for women was led by New Zealand. On February 16, 1946 the sub-Commission on the Status of Women was formed as part of the Human Rights Commission, and granted full status after its first meeting.Journal of Women’s History, Winter 2008, Laville, Helen.

He has been ranked as one of Canada's 500 Leading Lawyers (Lexpert) since 2000 and is consistently rated as one of Canada's top securities litigators by the same publication. He has worked on many of Canada's leading securities cases, including Asbestos Corp., Bre-X Minerals Ltd., Canadian Tire, Cinar Corporation, Hollinger, Torstar/Southam, Philip Services and YBM. He received his B.A. and LL.B. from the University of Toronto in 1976 and 1979, respectively. He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1981. At the beginning of his career, he worked for McTaggart, Potts, Stone & Herridge and then McMillan Binch before moving to the Ontario Securities Commission in 1985 where he served as Associate General Counsel and then Director of Enforcement. In 1990, he joined the Toronto office of Heenan Blaikie as a litigation partner and stayed there until he founded Groia & Company in 2000, where he is a Principal.  Bre-X and The Trial of John B. Felderhof  Mr. Groia is perhaps best known for his successful defence of John Felderhof in an almost decade- long trial resulting from the Bre-X Minerals scandal, the largest mining fraud in Canadian history. The gold-mining scandal was the result of Bre-X Minerals's false reports of an enormous gold deposit at Busang, Indonesia. Bre-X bought the Busang site in March 1993 and, in October 1995, announced significant amounts of gold had been discovered, sending its stock price soaring. Originally a penny stock, its market price reached a peak at CAD $286.50 per share in May 1996 on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), with a total capitalization of over CAD $6 billion. Bre-X Minerals collapsed in 1997 after the gold samples were found to be a fraud. In May 1999, the Ontario Securities Commission charged Mr. Felderhof, Bre-X Minerals's Vice-President of Exploration, with insider trading and participating in misleading press releases. The trial was an acrimonious one and was suspended in April 2001 when the OSC tried to have the presiding judge, Justice Peter Hryn, removed for alleged bias against the prosecution. This request was denied by justice Archie Campbell, and, on 10 December 2003, the appeal was denied by the Ontario Court of Appeal. Felderhof's trial resumed in 2005, and he was acquitted on the merits of charges in a 600-page decision in 2007.  Bre-X and the Law Society of Upper Canada  Since Felderhof's acquittal, the Law Society of Upper Canada has found Groia guilty of incivility during the defence of Felderhof. Groia's appeal against the LSUC's misconduct ruling was thrown out by an Ontario Divisional Court in early February 2015, but Groia stated that he intended to pursue the matter further at the Court of Appeal. The LSUC's judgement has been heavily criticized by numerous Canadian legal commentators, including the Criminal Lawyers Association, for its \\"potential chilling effect upon defence counsel\\". After a long legal battle, on June 1, 2018, Groia prevailed, as the Supreme Court of Canada ultimately concluded that a finding of professional misconduct by the Law Society's Appeal Tribunal “against [Groia] on the basis of incivility was unreasonable.”  Other Activities  Mr. Groia has been committed to legal education throughout his career. He has presented securities and corporate law papers at McGill University's Meredith Lectures, the Peat Marwick Memorial Lectures, the Law Society of Upper Canada Special Lectures, the Langdon Hall Securities Law Practitioners' Programme and the Oxford Conference on International Securities Fraud. He has taught classes in securities law and trial practice at the University of Alberta, Windsor Law School, Osgoode Hall Law School, University of Western Ontario, Dalhousie University, University of Ottawa Law School, McGill University Faculty of Law and the University of Toronto. In 2007, Mr. Groia and Pamela Hardie published Canada's first and only textbook on securities litigation, Securities Litigation and Enforcement. The second edition was published in 2012. In 2018, Mr. Groia accepted to represent businessperson Kevin O'Leary in his lawsuit contesting the constitutionality of certain election finance rules.

Eriksson was the first to describe the special forms within morphologically similar species of rust fungi. He has over 400 publications on studies primarily focusing on fungal pathogens at the cellular level and understanding the process of infection. Early life and education Eriksson was born in Hyllie, near Malmö, Sweden. His father Anders Eriksson was a farmer by profession. Eriksson got interested in botany when he was pursuing his high school degree in Malmö. He started collecting plants for his class project. Eriksson received his PhD from University of Lund (Sweden) in 1874 entitled “Studies over leguminosernas tubers”. Italian physician and anatomist Marcello Malpighi considered the tubers in legumes as galls. It was Eriksson who described that a fungus is responsible for the galls and therefore could be pathogenic in nature. Although now it's clear that a nitrogen fixing bacteria live in symbiosis with legumes but the work of Eriksson was valued at that time and his dissertation was published in Lund university year book and he was awarded with Zetterstedtska award. Positions held Immediately after his PhD, he was appointed as a lecturer (docent) in botany at the university. Eriksson had a 22-year-long teaching experiences in university of Lund, university of Uppsala and New elementary school in Stockholm. In 1876 he accepted the botanist position in Academy of Agriculture. In 1885, he was appointed as a professor and director of a newly established plant physiology division. With time the division kept expanding and it was reorganized and expanded to Central Institution for experimental system in agriculture. Eriksson was the director of the center from 1907 to 1913 before his retirement. Research Eriksson primary research interest was in diseases of crops with primary focus on mildew and parasitic fungus. The most significant finding of his research work was to describe the special forms within morphologically similar species of rust fungi. His conclusion was rust fungi are specialized and they are biologically different although they exhibit similarity in morphology. Studies of fungal plant pathogen at cellular level by Eriksson provided the better understanding of the infection process and also contributed to the plant breeding programs. Besides working on rust, Eriksson also studied a lot of other pathogens including clover rot, potato disease and fungus, fruit scab and mold, felt sick on carrot, floral and branch disease in fruit trees, spinach mildew and gooseberry mildew. Eriksson is considered to be first in writing the growers manual on fungal diseases. Eriksson published several books and monographs during his academic career. He also travelled to different countries in Europe. He participated in several international conferences as a representative of the Swedish government. The credit for establishment of plant physiological laboratory in Erescati near Stockholm goes to him.

The title was either inherited or granted by the Hospodar, often together with an administrative function. The boyars held much of the political power in the principalities and, until the Phanariote era, they elected the Hospodar. As such, until the 19th century, the system oscillated between an oligarchy and an autocracy with the power concentrated in the hospodar's hands.Djuvara, p.135 Origins During the Middle Ages, Romanians lived in autonomous communities called obște which mixed private and common ownership, employing an open field system. The private ownership of land gained ground In the 14th and 15th centuries, leading to differences within the obște towards a stratification of the members of the community.Costăchel et al., p. 111 The name of the \\"boyars\\" (boier in Romanian; the institution being called boierie) was borrowed from the Slavs, with whom the Romanians had a close relationship early in the Middle Ages.Djuvara, p.131 The creation of the feudal domain in which the landlords were known as boyars, was mostly through danii (\\"donations\\") system: the hospodars gave away whole villages to military servants, usurping the right of property of the obște.Costăchel et al., p. 112 By the 16th century, many of the still-free villages were forcefully taken over by boyars,Costăchel et al., p. 113 while some people were forced to agree to become serfs (see Serfdom in Wallachia and Moldavia) due to hunger, invasions, high taxes, debts, which further deteriorated the economic standing of the free peasants.Costăchel et al., p. 114 Apart from the court boyars and the military elite, some boyars (\\"countryside boyars\\") arose from within the villages, when a leader of the obște (usually called knyaz) swore fidelity to the hospodar and becoming the landlord of the village.Costăchel et al., p. 177 Feudal era The hospodar was considered the supreme ruler of the land and he received a land rent from the peasants, who also had to pay a rent to the boyar who owned the land.Costăchel et al., p. 174 The boyars were generally excepted from any taxes and rents to be paid to the hospodar. The boyars were entitled to a rent that was a percentage of the peasants' produce (initially one-tenth, hence its name, dijmă) in addition to a number of days of unpaid labour (corvée, locally known as clacă or robotă).Pascu et al., p. 139 However, not all landlords who owned villages were boyars, a different class existed of landlords without a boyar title, called cneji or judeci in Wallachia and nemeși in Moldavia. They were however not tax-exempt like the boyars.Costăchel et al., p. 179 The upper boyars (known as vlastelin in Wallachia) had to supply the hospodar with a number of warriors proportional to the number of villages they owned.Costăchel et al., p. 189 Some boyars were court officials, the office being called dregătorie, while others were boyars without a function. Important offices at the court that were held by boyars included vistier (treasurer), stolnic (pantler), vornic (concierge) and logofăt (chancellor).Costăchel et al., p. 184-185 While early the court officials were not important and often they were not even boyars, with time, boyars started to desire the functions, in order to participate in the government of the country, but also to get the incomes that were afferent to each function.Costăchel et al., p. 193 While the era is often called \\"feudal\\" in the Romanian historiography, there were some major differences between the status of the Western feudal lords and the status of the Romanian boyars.Djuvara, p.133 While a hierarchy existed in Wallachia and Moldavia just like in the West, the power balance was titled towards the hospodar, who had everyone as subjects and who had the power to demote even the richest boyar, to confiscate his wealth or even behead him. However, the power for the election of the hospodar was held by the great boyar families, who would form groups and alliances, often leading to disorder and instability. Hospodar Nicholas Mavrogenes and the boyar council Phanariote era divan After the Phanariote regime was instated in Moldavia (1711) and Wallachia (1716), many of the boyar class was made out of Constantinople Greeks who belonged to the Phanariote clients, who became officials and were assimilated to the boyar class or locals who bought their titles.Ionescu, p.63 When coming to Bucharest or Iași, the new Phanariote hospodars came with a Greek retinue who were given the most important official jobs; many of these Greeks married into local boyar families. In order to consolidate their position within the Wallachian and Moldavian boyar class, the officials were allowed to keep their boyar title after the end of their term. The official functions, which traditionally were given for a year, were often bought with money as an investment, since the function would often give large incomes in return. While the official functions were often given to both Romanians and Greeks, there was an exception: throughout the Phanariote era, the treasurers were mostly local boyars because they were more competent in collecting taxes.Ionescu, p.64 When the descendants of a boyar were not able to obtain even the lowest function, they became \\"fallen boyars\\" (mazili), who nevertheless, kept some fiscal privileges.Djuvara, p.136 Many of the newly bestowed local boyars were wealthy merchants who paid in order to become boyars, in some cases they were even forced by the hospodar to become boyars (and thus pay the hospodar a sum).Ionescu, p.65 The princely courts of Bucharest and Iași kept title registers, which included a list of all the boyars (known as Arhondologia). Since the hospodar wanted to maximize his income, it was in his interest to create as many boyars as possible (and receive money from each), leading to an inflation in the number of boyars. The economic basis of the boyar's class was land ownership: by the 18th century, more than half of the land of Wallachia and Moldavia being owned by them. For instance, according to the 1803 Moldavian census, out of the 1711 villages and market towns, the boyars owned 927 of them.Djuvara, p. 137 The process that began during the feudal era, of boyars seizing properties from the free peasants, continued and accelerated during this period. The boyars wore costumes similar to those of the Turkish nobility, with the difference that instead of the turban, most of them wore a very large Kalpak.Djuvara, p.109 Female members of the boyar class also wore Turkish inspired costume.Amila Buturovic & Irvin Cemil Schick: Women in the Ottoman Balkans: Gender, Culture and History 2007 page 210-213 Many boyars used large sums of money for conspicuous consumption,Djuvara, p.145 particularly luxurious clothing, but also carriages, jewelry and furniture.Djuvara, p.119 The luxury of the boyars' lives contrasted strongly not only with the squalor of the Romanian villages, but also with the general appearance of the capitals, this contrast striking the foreigners who visited the Principalities.Djuvara, p. 120 In the first decade of the 19th-century, female members of the boyar class started to adopt Western fashion: in July 1806, the wife of the hospodar in Iași, Safta Ispilanti, received the wife of the French consul dressed according to the French fashion. Male boyars, however, did not reform their costume to Western fashion until around the 1840s. The opening towards Western Europe meant that the boyars adopted the Western mores and the luxury expenses increased. While the greater boyars were able to afford these expenses through the intensification of the exploitation of their domains (and the peasants working on them), many smaller boyars were ruined by them.Djuvara, p.146 Early modern The Public assembly of Boyars, 1837 1848 Revolution The burning of Regulamentul Organic and of the register of boyar ranks during the 1848 revolution Modern Romania Starting with the middle of the 19th century, the word \\"boyar\\" began to lose its meaning as a \\"noble\\" and to mean simply \\"large landowner\\". Cuza's Constitution (known as the Statut) of 1864 deprived the boyars from the legal privileges and the ranks officially disappeared, but, through their wealth, they retained their economic and political influence,Hitchins, p.9 particularly through the electoral system of census suffrage. Some of the lower boyars joined the bourgeoisie involved in commerce and industry. A number of 2000 large landowners held over 3 million hectares or about 38% of all arable land.Hitchins, p.158 Most of these boyars no longer took any part in managing their estates, but rather lived in Bucharest or in Western Europe (particularly France, Italy and Switzerland). They leased their estates for a fixed sum to arendași (leaseholders). Many of the boyars found themselves in financial difficulties; many of their estates had been mortgaged. The lack of interest in agriculture and their domains led to a dissolution of the boyar class. Legacy The movement surrounding the Sămănătorul magazine lamented the disappearance of the boyar class, while not arguing for their return.Hitchins, p.68 Historian Nicolae Iorga saw the system not as a selfish exploitation of the peasants by the boyars, but rather as a rudimentary democracy.Hitchins, p.69 On the other side of the political spectrum, Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea thought that the reforms didn't go far enough, arguing that the condition of the peasants was a neo-serfdom.Hitchins, p.77 Notes References *V.

'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 Following a rearrangement of the Sunlander consists and the construction of further air-conditioned cars, the Capricornian replaced the Rockhampton Mail in 1970, taking 14.25 hours for the overnight trip and running 5 times per week. By 1988 the transit time was 13 hours 55 minutes, reduced to 12 hours 35 minutes following the extensive upgrading of the North Coast line (NCL) in 1989. However, the pending electrification of the NCL led to an announcement that the Capricornian would be eliminated once the Spirit of Capricorn service was introduced. Protests about the loss of the overnight sleeper service resulted in retention of the train on Thursday, Friday and Sunday nights. It was replaced by the Spirit of the Outback in 1993, which runs from Brisbane to Longreach, largely to cater for the 'rail cruising' tourism market.

Design and development On one of his regular visits to German glider builders, Teichfuss watched the construction of high performance aircraft like Hans Jacobs' DFS Reiher. The Turbine design, begun in 1938, was a high performance machine which showed Jakob's influence but was rather simpler to construct. It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered, elliptically tipped plan. The inner panels extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. There were spoilers on the inner panels at about mid- chord. Its fuselage was ovoid in cross-section and plywood skinned, tapering markedly towards the tail. The long, multi-framed canopy glazing extended forward to form the nose profile and provide a clear view forward. The horizontal tail, like the wing was straight tapered and round tipped. The cantilever tailplane was mounted over the fuselage on a short pedestal, its elevators having a cut-out between them for rudder movement. There was no fin but the aerodynamically balanced rudder was broad and roughly D-shaped, extending down to the keel where its underside was protected by a long tail bumper. The Turbine landed not on a skid but a small, semi-recessed monowheel located under the wing. The Turbine first flew on 27 July 1939, flown by Adriano Mantelli. In early August he flew it at the Third Asiago National Gliding Competition then went to the World Student Competition near Vienna just a few days before the outbreak of World War II. Despite the structural simplifications Teichfuss had made in the hope of small series production, only one Turbine was built.

The game is notable for reuniting music composer Nobuo Uematsu and art director Hideo Minaba, who previously collaborated on Final Fantasy V (1992), Final Fantasy VI (1994), Final Fantasy IX (2000), and Lost Odyssey (2007). Gameplay The game plays as a role-playing video game with turn- based battles. The game also contains summons and a class system that alters the main character's move-set and growth. Characters gain levels and abilities by accruing experience; by collecting a certain materials, some character may earn an extra star (which called \\"FLB\\" or full limit break) summons and weapons equipped also confer characters with bonuses on attack power and HP. The characters themselves are gained either via quests (the main story quests or special event quests) or by using in-game currency to receive random crystal fragments, which may contain special weapons that add specific characters to the party. Characters, summons, and weapons are ranked (from best to worst) as SSR, SR, R, or N; each is also of type wind, water, fire, earth, light, or darkness. It is recommended to use a superior element on battle (for example using water against fire) as some dungeon giving a penalty to the non-superior element. Voice actors provide voices for all of the characters in battle, and for much of the main and event story lines. Plot The Captain (the player character, either Gran or Djeeta by default) and their winged companion Vyrn are relaxing in the town of Zinkenstill, when they spot an Erste Empire airship in the sky nearby. The Captain inadvertently comes to the rescue of a girl named Lyria and an Imperial Officer named Katalina as they try to escape from the Empire. However, the Captain suffers a mortal wound during the fight, forcing Lyria to merge her soul with them in order to bring them back from the brink of death. Lyria then uses her power to summon a giant monster called Proto-Bahamut, driving the Empire's forces away. With the Captain and Katalina's fates now tied to Lyria, the three of them decide to head to the island of Estalucia, both to escape from the Empire and possibly find clues about the Captain's estranged father. Unfortunately, Katalina's poor piloting skills cause them to crash-land elsewhere in the Port Breeze Archipelago. The trio look for a working airship and a pilot to steer it. They end up meeting Rackam, an odd helmsman working on an airship that has been broken for years. However, the Empire follows them to the island as well, looking to recapture Lyria. The three eventually manage to convince Rackam to help them fight off the Imperial soldiers chasing them, and in return help him finish repairing his airship, The Grandcypher, to make it skyworthy. As the Captain travels across the skies, gathering up more allies on their journey and fighting Primal Beasts, the crew find themselves slowly dragged into a plot involving the mysterious Black Knight, the doll-like Orchis, and the history that the Empire seeks to keep secret while they pursue Lyria.

It was so effective to the point of raising worries of government regulation to stop exploitation; the Japan Online Game Association imposed stricter restrictions on the industry after a player streamed themselves spending around 700,000 (~6,000 US dollars) attempting to get Andira, a new and heavily advertised character, on December 31, 2015. There was a time-limited period where Andira's appearance rate increased, with her becoming more difficult to acquire on January 3, fueling \\"delirium\\" and peer pressure on players to attempt to get her immediately. Frustration and claims of Andira's \\"drop rate\\" being less than advertised from other players as well led developer Cygames to offer compensation in crystals to people caught in the incident, a promise to set up a system to automatically give a drop after too many \\"misses\\", and an apology from the management.グラブル」高額課金をサイバー副社長に問う After the change in policy, players choose and immediately acquire a desired character after spending 90,000 crystals (300 draws). Development Uematsu worked on eleven tracks for the game, with Tsutomu Narita doing nine others, and Minaba drawing roughly 100 potential character designs. The game also contains voice overs from Hiroaki Hirata, who previously worked on Final Fantasy XII and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. The game was originally planned for release in Japan for December 17, 2013, but it was put back to March 10, 2014. The game is free-to- play and published by Mobage. At TGS 2015, it was announced that the game would receive an international release in March 2016. Instead of an international launch, a language patch was released adding an in-game option to switch from Japanese to English. This allows international players who have been playing the Japanese version to keep all of their data. Reception By March 2016, the game had been downloaded over 10 million times in Japan, which had risen to over 25million by December 2019. The game grossed () between January 2017 and October 2017.

It travelled on the Central west line between Rockhampton and Winton. History Victorian Railways introduced air-conditioned trains in 1935, and Queensland decided to follow suit in the late 1940s. Carriages were designed to travel to all parts of the system, meaning a maximum axle load of , which was a challenge for the dining cars. New features included showers in the sleeping cars, roomettes in first class and head end power cars, especially necessary where trains may be delayed by floods or other events, as was often the case. The Midlander was introduced in 1954, replacing the Mail train with its wooden carriages and providing a more comfortable and cleaner service.

He has been noted for his work on force structure planning of the United States Navy, including the role of the aircraft carrier in modern strategic environments, the structure of the carrier air wing, and more recently, U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to build a 355 ship navy. Hendrix served as a senior military assistant to Andrew Marshall, and has been suggested as a possible candidate for the offices of Undersecretary of the Navy and director of the United States Department of Defense Office of Net Assessment. Education Hendrix graduated from Purdue University in 1988 with a bachelor's degree in political science. He holds master's degrees in national security affairs from the Naval Postgraduate School and history from Harvard University, and a PhD in war studies from King's College, London. Naval career Admiral James Stavridis as director of the Naval History and Heritage Command.alt= Hendrix joined the United States Navy in 1988 as a commissioned officer, and completed his flight training to become a naval flight officer in 1989. He was stationed with Patrol Squadron 10, and deployed to the Mediterranean, Red Sea, North Atlantic, and Caribbean. In 1994, he joined the as a tactical action officer, and deployed to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. In 1997 Hendrix served as Fleet Training Officer for the Patrol Squadron 30 where he supervised the Aircraft Improvement Program. He then took command of Tactical Air Control Squadron 11 and deployed again to the Gulf. As a staff officer, Hendrix worked on the Chief of Naval Operations executive panel on homeland defense, naval aviation, and naval missile defense, as the Executive Secretary for the Irregular Warfare Quadrennial Defense Review at the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, as an assistant to Andrew Marshall in the Office of Net Assessment, advising with regards to future developments in military technology, and was director of the Secretary of the Navy's advisory panel. At the time of his retirement, he was the director of the Naval History and Heritage Command and the official curator of the Navy. Post-military career After retirement from the Navy, Hendrix worked at the Center for a New American Security, where he was a senior fellow and director of the defense program. As part of his work with center, he testified before the Senate Committee on Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower on strategies for achieving U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for a 350 ship navy. He is currently the vice president of the Telemus Group, a security consultancy specializing in defense forecasting, wargaming and qualitative analysis. Written work Hendrix's work has covered a range of subjects within the fields of naval history, strategy, and planning. He is a vocal advocate of a \\"high-low\\" naval procurement policy, which combines limited high tech capabilities with an array of lower cost, lower maintenance ships, aircraft, and weapons systems in order to balance different grades of threats. He is known for challenging the prevailing U.S. naval doctrine on a number of points. For example, he is critical of aircraft carriers on grounds of their high expense and questionable survivability in modern strategic environments. He has proposed modifying the structure of the carrier air wing to include more unmanned aerial vehicles, which he believes essential to countering modern threats. Hendrix also favors increasing the number and capabilities of strategic bombers. He contends that a large and effective fleet of bombers has a historical precedent of reducing the total length of wars, and can simultaneously force rivals to invest in air defenses while acting as a powerful deterrent. His support for this policy is in part derived from his work on Theodore Roosevelt's use of naval power as a tool for diplomacy, which points to the conclusion that Roosevelt's naval strategy laid the foundation for establishing the United States as a great world power. He is a proponent of Roosevelt's \\"big stick diplomacy,\\" and views the strategic bomber as a means to carry on this tradition in the 21st century, and thus maintain the United States' status as a dominant superpower. Hendrix has collaborated with Robert C. O'Brien, the current United States National Security Advisor. His work has appeared in a number of media outlets, including the National Review, Foreign Policy, the National Interest, Fox News, the New York Observer, the Japan Times, Politico, as well as a number of national defense blogs.

As an actor, Summers was nominated for the 2018 Audelco Award for 'Best Featured Actor in a Musical,' for \\"On Kentucky Avenue\\" – which he also directed and won the 2018 Audelco Award for 'Best Director of a Musical.' Summers has appeared on Broadway and in numerous TV/Film roles, such as Core FOI (Fruit of Islam) in Malcolm X, a neurosurgeon on Law & Order; a turn-of-the-century cook on Boardwalk Empire, and as a Police Sergeant, opposite Tom Selleck on Blue Bloods.  Early life and career  Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Summers' first professional job was performing on the Showboat at Opryland USA while enrolled at Tennessee State University.

After a couple of years performing in numerous Off and Off-Off Broadway shows, Summers made his Broadway debut in the original production of Dreamgirls. Years later, Summers reprised the role he played in the Original Dreamgirls for the Dreamgirls 20th Anniversary Benefit Concert with Lillias White, Billy Porter, Audra McDonald, Norm Lewis and Heather Headley. Later, at the invitation of Broadway vocal arranger Chapman Roberts (Five Guys Named Moe), Summers performed at Carnegie Hall. In 1986, after a stint performing in Monte Carlo with Jenifer Lewis, Summers returned to work on a one-man show in Indiana, where when traveling one night he suffered a near-fatal car accident. On his journey to a full recovery, his voice as a stage writer emerged, leading to his creating and performing in what would become the Off-Broadway hit, From My Hometown. Writing led to Summers joining the Dramatists Guild of America, and his work or incarnations thereof, have been produced and presented On and Off-Broadway, at numerous regional theatres such as the Milwaukee Repertory, where Summers collaborated with Kevin Ramsey to premiere their original tap-dance musical, If These Shoes Could Talk, which starred Harold Nicholas, of the legendary Nicholas Brothers, in his farewell stage performance.

According to the IPPY website, the awards \\"reward those who exhibit the courage, innovation, and creativity to bring about change in the world of publishing.\\"  History  The IPPY Awards were founded in 1996 by the Small Press publishing magazine. In 1998, Small Press became the Independent Publisher magazine, but continued to run the annual IPPY Awards. The IPPY's mission statement claims that the awards are intended to \\"recognize the deserving but often unsung titles published by independent authors and publishers, and bring them to the attention of booksellers, buyers, librarians, and book lovers around the world.\\" The IPPY criteria for an \\"independent\\" publication mandates that all entries must be from publications that are either 1) independently owned and operated, 2) operated by a foundation or university, or 3) long-time independents that became incorporated but operate autonomously and publish fewer than 50 titles a year. The first IPPY awards received 325 entries and awarded 90 gold, silver, and bronze medals. In 2020, over 3,000 books were entered into the IPPYs, and 422 medals were awarded. In 25 years, IPPY entry categories have expanded from the 28 available in 1996 to more than a hundred options in 2020, including separate categories for specific genres, regions, and E-books.  Entry and prize consideration  Entry is chargeable. In 2020, the entry fee was $85. Entry discounts for regional and E-book categories are often available. For the 25th anniversary IPPY Awards in 2021, a $25 off discount was available for early submissions. Entries are judged based on first impression, design, originality, use of language, message delivery, and relevance. IPPY medalists receive certificates, medals, and book sticker seals. They also have the option to purchase additional merchandise, including plaques, electronic images, and additional medals and seals. About 2,400 publishers throughout the English-speaking world participate in the awards each year. In 2017 the contest drew over 5,000 entries, and medals were awarded to authors and publishers from 43 U.S. states, seven Canadian provinces and 15 countries. In 2020, medals were awarded to authors and publishers from all 50 U.S. states, 10 Canadian provinces, and 61 countries.  Outstanding Book of the Year  In 2010, the IPPYs introduced additional “Outstanding Book of the Year” awards. Every IPPY submission is considered for an Outstanding Book award, regardless of category. The outstanding medalists are chosen for exemplifying “daring spirit” with a book that is “the most heartfelt, unique, outspoken and experimental among all entries.” In 2020, there were eleven Outstanding Books in eight categories: * Most Original Concept * Best Book Arts Craftsmanship * Most Outstanding Design * Most Likely to Save the Planet * Independent Spirit Award * Independent Voice Award * Freedom Fighter * Peacemaker Notable Outstanding Books of the Year include Peter Kalmus’ Being the Change: Live Well and Spark a Climate Revolution, which was named 2018’s Most Likely To Save the Planet, as well as Warren Lehrer’s A Life in Books: The Rise and Fall of Bleu Mobley, 2014’s Most Original Concept.  Recipients  Books by IPPY winners in 2016, 2017 and 2018 were published by university presses including Princeton, Stanford, Yale, Wisconsin, Iowa, and other major university presses. Among the fiction gold medalists was Elena Ferrante's The Story of the Lost Child, originally published in Italy and issued in English by Europa. Previous winners in fiction categories include the small presses Milkweed, Coffee House, Graywolf, The Other Press, McPherson, Europa, and McSweeney's. IPPY Gold Medal winner Lord of Misrule also won the National Book Award and The Patience Stone also won France's Prix Goncourt for its French edition.

The Boro Baptist Convention was established in 1914 and completed its centenary celebrations in 2014. It has its headquarters at Harisinga in Udalguri District of Bodoland, Assam. It is affiliated to the North Bank Baptist Christian Association. The Union is made primarily of Bodo people, an indigenous ethnic group of Assam. History In 1914 Rev. George Richard Kampfer of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (ABFMS) who was stationed in Guwahati came to Borigaon and established the first Baptist church. It was in the year 1914 under the guidance of Rev. Kampfer, the Baptist churches of Udalguri district (then Mangaldai Sub division) of Assam came together unitedly and formed a Christian Organization called \\"Mangaldai Baptist Christian Association\\". At the time of formation there were only 5 churches. In the year 1983 when Darrang district was divided into two districts by the government it was in that pattern the association was renamed as \\"Darrang Baptist Christian Association\\".

According to the Circle Edict of 1522, every Circle had to nominate a Captain (Hauptmann) and notify the Emperor. He was not, however, primarily the military superior of the circle troops, but was to carry out all the tasks laid down in the Circle Edict.according to Hofmann, p. 66 ff In the Augsburg reforms of 25 September 1555 his duties were set forth again, this time under the title of Circle Colonel.§§ 56 - 60 of the Augsburg Reichsabschied  Duties  The most important duties of the circle colonels were: * the responsibility for law and order (the Landfrieden) within the Circle, * ensuring the Religious Peace, * enforcing imperial legal rulings, * administrative tasks concerning imperial currency and imperial policing, * legal enforcement (execution) against defaulters within the Circle, * taking charge of Circle business as tasked by the Circle between Circle councils, * the mustering of circle troops and the supervision of their equipment and supplies.

It is located underneath Moncloa square and Princesa street near Arco de la Victoria and the headquarters of the Spanish Air Force in fare Zone A.  History  The station was inaugurated on 17 July 1963 when Line 3 was extended from Argüelles. The station featured platforms, in contrast with the found in the rest of the line. Because of this, it was the only station on Line 3 that was not renovated in 2006. The station had two entrances, one on Isaac Peral street, and the other on Fernández de los Ríos street, both of which are closed today. The Line 6 platforms were inaugurated on 10 May 1995 when the segment between Laguna and Ciudad Universitaria was opened, converting Line 6 into a circular route. The Line 6 platforms are deeper than the Line 3 platforms, and a new corridor was built to connect them, as well as a new entrance on Princesa street in front of the Junta Municipal de Distrito (district city offices). The first underground bus terminal was inaugurated later that year, and it served intercity buses to towns on the Sierra de Guadarrama and towns along the A-6 highway. It had 14 bays and about 30 lines. The terminal had two additional entrances, one the corner of Paseo Moret and Princesa street and another on Princesa street in front of the Air Force headquarters. However, the number of intercity buses serving the station increased over the years, and by 2004 some buses had to stop on the street above the station due to a lack of space. In order to address this issue, a new deeper set of Line 3 platforms was constructed between 2004 and 2006, and in 2008 a new bus terminal was opened in the space formerly occupied by the old Line 3 platforms. The new Line 3 platforms were built parallel to the Line 6 platforms to facilitate transfers. The Line 3 platform work affected the entire line, which had to be shut down for three consecutive summers between 2004 and 2006. On 30 September 2006, the new platforms were opened. As part of the renovation, a new entrance was built on Arcipreste de Hita street and a new access was provided to the bus terminal, and the original entrances on Isaac Peral and Fernández de los Ríos streets were closed. In the space left behind by the old Line 3 platforms, an expansion of the underground bus terminal was built, including an entrance in front of the Junta Municipal de Distrito. The new bus terminal opened on 19 February 2008, and seven bus lines were moved to the station. In February and March of that year, additional lines were moved into the new station. In 2008 and 2009, the bus lines in the old terminal were reorganized to make better use of space. On 12 January 2009, a 7000 series train on Line 6 derailed in the station, and from that point on AnsaldoBreda series trains were permanently banned from Line 6. Between 28 June and 28 August 2014, the segment of Line 6 between Moncloa and Vicente Aleixandre (then known as Metropolitano) was closed for renovations, making Moncloa a temporary terminal station on Line 6.

Some publishers waive the fee in cases of hardship or geographic location, but this is not a widespread practice. An article processing charge does not guarantee that the author retains copyright to the work, or that it will be made available under a Creative Commons license. Background Journals use a variety of ways to generate the income required to cover publishing costs (including editorial costs, any costs of administering the peer review system), such as subsidies from institutions and subscriptions. A majority of open access journals do not charge article processing charges, but a significant and growing number of them do. They are the most common funding method for professionally published open access articles. APC fees applied to academic research are usually expensive, effectively limiting open access circulation among the less affluent institutions, scholars, and students. The APC model of open access, among other controversies, is part of the wider and increasing global Open Access OA's ethics debate. Other publishing fees Different academic publishers have widely varying levels of fees, from under $100 to over $3000. High fees are sometimes charged by traditional publishers in order to publish in a hybrid open access journal, which make an individual article in a subscription journal open access. The average APC for hybrid journals has been calculated to be almost twice as high as APCs from full open access publishers. Journals with high impact factors from major publishers tend to have the highest APCs. Open access articles often have a surcharge compared to a closed-access APC; for example the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences charges $1590-$4215 per article (depending on length) for closed-access, with a surcharge of $1700-$2200 for open-access (depending on licence).PNAS, Publication Fees Similarly, AGU's Journal of Geophysical Research charges $1000 for closed-access and $3500 for open-access. Even when publishers do not charge standard fees, excess or overlength fees might still apply after a certain number of pages or publication units is exceeded; additional fees might exist for color figures, primarily for print journals that are not online-only. While publication charges occur upon article acceptance, article submission fees are charged prior to the start of peer review; they are common among journals in some fields, e.g., finance and economics. Page charge may refer to either publication or submission fees. Criticism Article processing charges shift the burden of payment from readers to authors (or their funders), which creates a new set of concerns. One concern is that if a publisher makes a profit from accepting papers, it has an incentive to accept anything submitted, rather than selecting and rejecting articles based on quality. This could be remedied, however, by charging for the peer-review rather than acceptance.Harnad, S. (2010) No-Fault Peer Review Charges: The Price of Selectivity Need Not Be Access Denied or Delayed . D-Lib Magazine 16 (7/8) Another concern is that institutional budgets may need to be adjusted in order to provide funding for the article processing charges required to publish in many open access journals (e.g. those published by BioMed Central). It has been argued that this may reduce the ability to publish research results due to lack of sufficient funds, leading to some research not becoming a part of the public record.Eftekhari, A (2012) Open Access Dream. Critic Pen. Unless discounts are available to authors from countries with low incomes or external funding is provided to cover the cost, article processing charges could exclude authors from developing countries or less well-funded research fields from publishing in open access journals. However, under the traditional model, the prohibitive costs of some non-open access journal subscriptions already place a heavy burden on the research community; and if green open access self-archiving eventually makes subscriptions unsustainable, the cancelled subscription savings can pay the gold open access publishing costs without the need to divert extra money from research. Moreover, many open access publishers offer discounts or publishing fee waivers to authors from developing countries or those suffering financial hardship. Self-archiving of non-open access publications provides a low cost alternative model.Corrado, E. (Spring 2005). The importance of Open Access, Open Source, and Open Standards for libraries . Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship. Another concern is the redirection of money by major funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome Trust from the direct support of research to the support of open access publication. Robert Terry, Senior Policy Advisor at the Wellcome Trust, has said that he feels that 1–2% of their research budget will change from the creation of knowledge to the dissemination of knowledge. Research institutions could cover the cost of open access by converting to an open access journal cost-recovery model, with the institutions' annual tool access subscription savings being available to cover annual open access publication costs.Harnad, S (2007) \\"The Green Road to Open Access: A Leveraged Transition\\" . In: Anna Gacs. The Culture of Periodicals from the Perspective of the Electronic Age. L'Harmattan. 99–106. Retrieved 2012-11-19. A 2017 study by the Max Planck Society the annual turnovers of academic publishers amount to approximately EUR 7.6 billion. It is argued that this money comes predominantly from publicly funded scientific libraries as they purchase subscriptions or licenses in order to provide access to scientific journals for their members. The study was presented by the Max Planck Digital Library and found that subscription budgets would be sufficient to fund the open access publication charges, but does not address how unaffiliated authors or authors from institutions without funds will contribute to the scholarly record.

The goddess is seated on a throne and while parts of the sculpture are in excellent condition, the back and arm-rails of the throne, as well as her lower arms and hands, separately carved, are missing. The head was also carved independently from the body and fixed onto the neck. Demeter is depicted in a serene, timeless manner, that unveils her motherly role in the Greek pantheon of gods. Sanctuary of Demeter Demeter was the goddess of the Earth, of agriculture and of fertility who created the harvest, the grain and other crops as well as the circle of seasons. At Knidos she was worshipped with Hades and the other underworld deities including her mythical daughter Persephone. The Sanctuary of Demeter at Knidos was laid out in 350 BC, when the city was reestablished. The sanctuary consisted of a long terrace built into the side of an acropolis, overlooking the city and seascape below. Many votive sculptures were deposited within the sanctuary. Most of these were discovered by excavators in fragments, but the statue of divine Demeter herself remains relatively intact. Discovery The Demeter of Knidos was first seen by the British archaeologist Sir Charles Thomas Newton in 1857-58Martin-Luther Universität: \\"Dermeter of Knidos\\". and was almost immediately removed to London to become part of the British Museum's Ancient Greek and Roman collection.

It was carved in 1868 to serve the large concentrations of industrial firms in the neighborhood. A public walkway along the southwest side of the basin was constructed as part of the Queens West development in 2012. The basin contains several private vessels, the former Water's Edge restaurant, a former Prudence Island ferry boat, and a floating dock owned by Long Island City Community Boathouse, used for its kayaking programs. In November 2018 it was announced that Amazon would be building its large Amazon HQ2 campus on the land surrounding the basin. However, these plans have since been canceled.  Etymology  The basin's namesake is Henry Sheldon Anable, who was also the basin's financier. Anable was a prominent figure in local business and politics in 1860s, the time of the basin's creation. He was the nephew-in-law of then-president of Union College, Eliphalet Nott, who owned much of the land around Hunter's Point. Anable's ancestors were among the early Puritan settlers of Massachusetts, arriving in 1623. He is a descendant of Anthony Annable who was a passenger of the Anne, which was the third ship to arrive in the Plymouth Colony. History The short channel just south of Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell Island), is the Anable Basin. The larger channel in the corner of this 1912 map is Newtown Creek. The inlet was carved in 1868 at a time when Long Island City was home to numerous oil refineries and factories. At the time of the canal's creation, a mastodon bone was found on the site of the basin. For much of the 20th century, the major industrial property on the basin was Pepsi-Cola, which had its bottling plant at the point where Anable Basin meets the East River. In 1937 the prolific advertising firm Artkraft-Strauss Sign Corporation installed the cursive ruby- colored neon-on-metal Pepsi-Cola sign atop the bottling plant and it became an instant point of reference for Manhattan residents and passing ships. When the bottling plant was demolished in 1999, the iconic 120-foot-long sign was dismantled and reassembled at a nearby site by Rockrose Development Corporation. The sign is an official city landmark and part of Gantry Plaza State Park, which lines the shore of East River between Anable Basin and Hunters Point. In 1980, Water's Edge, a waterfront restaurant specializing in wedding venue, opened on the north side of the basin. It operated for over 30 years, until the then-owner was indicted for bribery and fraud charges. A new eatery, Anable Basin Sailing Bar & Grill, has since opened across the street. The eatery offers mooring for vessels, picnic tables by the waterfront and a mixture of American and ethnic dishes including ćevapi, a Bosnian sausage.  Redevelopment  In 2017, local real estate firms TF Cornerstone and Plaxall separately submitted proposals to the city to rezone the area around Anable Basin for development. TF Cornerstone's plan for 1,000 apartments and a light manufacturing complex was submitted in July, while Plaxall submitted its plan for a tower in December. The following year, the northern end of the Basin became part of the planned Amazon HQ2 Long Island City campus. Due to community opposition, Amazon withdrew its plans to build the Amazon HQ2 campus in February 2019. According to The City, following Amazon's decision to not try to build a second headquarters near Anable Basin, the New York City Council invited three property developers to prepare plans for future development of the neighborhood. The three developers were TF Cornerstone, Simon Baron Development, and L&L; Mag. A spokesman for city council explained “One of the main problems we had with Amazon’s proposal was the lack of community engagement. We’re happy that these stakeholders are being proactive, we look forward to being active participants in the process.” The Justice For All Coalition has called for any future development to be solely not-for- profit enterprises, and to restrict future commercial development. The group Your LIC, which was composed of TF Cornerstone, Plaxall, Simon Baron Development, and L&L; Mag, announced in May 2020 that they wanted to develop up to of space on a area composed of their individual holdings around Anable Basin. The plan would include up to 15 towers of between , as well as of open space, three schools, and of arts and culture space; half of the total new development space would be commercially zoned. The plan would require that the property be rezoned, and environmental scoping and land-use review would have to be conducted over the next year. Art and culture In October 2007, artist Chico MacMurtrie introduced the sculpture A Tree for Anable Basin in the basin. The 24-foot-high aluminum tree was set atop a floating island planted with native grass species. MacMurtrie is the founder of the Brooklyn- based workshop Amorphic Robot Works. In August 2012, to showcase sustainable agriculture, Cooper Union architecture student Karim Ahmed designed a hydroponic garden atop a 20-foot raft that was launched in the Anable Basin. Waterpod, as the project was called, grew sunflowers, kale, corn, and a baby nectarine tree. The project was inspired by the chinampa floating farms used in Aztec society. Ahmed's raft was moored at the northwest corner of the basin where Anable Basin Sailing Bar & Grill is located. In October 2016, The Plaxall Gallery was opened by LIC Artists Inc., a 12,000-square-foot converted waterfront warehouse donated by Plaxall Inc. and is home to three art galleries, a 90 seat theatre, outdoor event space and is located on the Anable Basin in Long Island City and over the years has become an important institution for the surrounding artistic community. In April 2020 the space was taken over by Culture Lab LIC, a new nonprofit arts and community organization. In June 2017, local art curator Brandon Stosuy in collaboration with Matthew Barney and a group of other artists installed a Trump countdown clock at the entrance of Anable Basin, visible from Manhattan. The art piece counts down the days and hours remaining in U.S. president Donald Trump's first term, which .

Early life Mayer was born in Baltimore on Oct. 15, 1795, to Christian Mayer, who emigrated from Germany to Baltimore in 1784. Charles' younger brother, Brantz Mayer (1809-1879), would become a diplomat like their father; in 1844, he founded the Maryland Historical Society. Another brother, Lewis Mayer, was a pioneer in anthracite mining and the father of Charles F.

In America, he increased his fortune as an East Indies ship owner and merchant, and also served his home country for five decades as Consul General of Wurttemberg. Returning to his home city, he became a leading light in its intellectual life: \\"His house was a center for all that was intellectual and cultured in the Baltimore of those days\\".

Later career In 1838, he was a director of the Baltimore and Port Deposit Railroad, whose president was Lewis Brantz, his father's business partner. The B&PD;, along with three other railroads, built the first rail link from Philadelphia to Baltimore. The firms merged in 1838 into the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, and Mayer stayed on as director. His service as an early railroad executive is noted on the 1839 Newkirk Viaduct Monument. Personal life Mayer married and had a son: * Henry Christian Mayer (1821–1846) He married again, to Eliza C.

It was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural landmark on 3 June 1931. History Although it was mentioned for the first time in 1068, it is believed that the monastic community settled in the place much earlier. It seems that the monastery was built between 1025-50 under the order of Guillem de Mediona of Corbera. In 1096, it was governed by Abbot Salomó, and depended on Cluny Abbey, through the monastery of Sant Pere de Casserres. In 1590, it joined the congregation of Tarragonés and then the monastery of San Pablo del Campo, which in 1835 was effected by the Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal. On 3 June 1931 the monastery became a Bien de Interés Cultural site. Building Internal view The building has a single nave covered with a barrel vault, a transept, and three apses externally decorated with arches and pilasters. Two apses are connected by open doors in the walls. The dome is topped by a small square bell tower with two-story windows. Remains of Roman wall paintings are preserved, with plant motifs. Other decorations include two linked plant stems in a figure eight, a wolf, and a bird with open wings. On the gospel apse, there are plant motifs as part of a frieze. This decoration is of a later period. Inside is a polychrome statue of the Virgin of the Llet, dated to the 13th century. The building underwent restoration in 1929 and 1992.

It was commissioned by the UK Coalition government in response to the manifesto commitments of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties in the 2010 general election. The Coalition believed that children in the UK were \\"being pressured to grow up too quickly\\", and sought recommendations on how to address what they perceived as public concern about this. On 6 December 2010 Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education, appointed Reg Bailey CBE, Chief Executive of the Mothers’ Union (which had previously launched the \\"Bye Buy Childhood\\" report and campaign on the issue) to lead the Review. The results were published on 6 June 2011. Recommendations The review made 14 recommendations: # Ensure that magazines and newspapers with sexualised images on their covers are not in easy sight of children. # Reduce the amount of on- street advertising containing sexualised imagery in locations where children are likely to see it. # Ensure the content of pre-watershed television programming better meets parents’ expectations. # Introduce age rating for music videos. # Make it easier for parents to block adult and age-restricted material from the internet. # Develop a retail code of good practice on retailing to children. # Ensure that the regulation of advertising reflects more closely parents’ and children’s views. # Prohibit the employment of children as brand ambassadors and in peer-to-peer marketing. # Define a child as under the age of 16 in all types of advertising regulation. # Raise parental awareness of marketing and advertising techniques. # Introduce quality assurance for media and commercial literacy resources and education for children. # Ensure greater transparency in the regulatory framework by creating a single website for regulators. # Make it easier for parents to express their views to businesses about goods and services. # Ensure that businesses and others take action on these recommendations. Criticism Criticism after publication centred on the remit given by the Government. It was claimed that there was no open inquiry into the issue and the results were presupposed by the terms of reference. There was no attempt to define the \\"sexualisation\\" that was the basis of the enquiry, merely acknowledging that it was highly subjective. Questionnaires used were described as containing leading questions. The consultation focussed on the views of parents rather than women's rights organisations or experts on children. The choice of a representative of the Mothers' Union to lead the enquiry was seen, by some, as reinforcing this focus. The recommendation of a voluntary code of conduct rather than legislation was seen as potentially ineffective. The lack of any reference to mandatory sex and relationships education or a strategy on ending violence against women and girls were seen as significant omissions. Implementation Opaque screens on magazine shelves have been introduced by some supermarkets to hide the partial nudity found on some magazine covers from children. In 2013 The Co-operative Food called for publishers to put such magazines in sealed bags. In 2014 supermarkets Tesco and Waitrose announced that they would be redesigning their newspaper displays to prevent the front pages of tabloid newspapers being seen by children. The move followed a joint campaign between No More Page 3 and Child Eyes. 'Active choice' filtering of adult content on the Internet (whereby the customer is required to actively decide whether or not to activate parental controls) in the UK by ISPs was also introduced in 2014.

PSIM has several modules that extend its functionality into specific areas of circuit simulation and design including: control theory, electric motors, photovoltaics and wind turbines PSIM is used by industry for research and product development and it is used by educational institutions for research and teaching. Modules PSIM has various add on modules, the full list and their descriptions can be found on the Powersim website. There are modules that enable motor drive simulation, digital control, and the calculation of thermal losses due to switching and conduction. There is a renewable energy module which allows for the simulation of photovoltaics (including temperature effects), batteries, supercapacitor, and wind turbines. Additionally there are several modules which allow co- simulation with other platforms to verify VHDL or Verilog code or to co simulate with an FEA program. The programs that PSIM currently co-simulates with are: Simulink, JMAG, and ModelSim. PSIM currently supports automatic c-code generation with the SimCoder Module and will output c-code for use with Texas Instruments F2833x and F2803x floating and fixed point digital signal processors from the C2000 series. With PSIM version 10.0.4, PSIM has support for Freescale Semiconductor Kinetis V series MCU. In addition, PSIM’s Processor-In-Loop simulation or PIL Module wasto control a PSIM simulation with code that is executing on a TI DSP or MCU. Comparison with SPICE PSIM has a much faster simulation speed than SPICE based simulators based on its usage of the ideal switch. With the additional Digital and SimCoupler Modules almost any kind of logic algorithm can be simulated. Since PSIM uses ideal switches the simulated waveforms will reflect this, making PSIM more suited for system level studies rather than switching transition studies. Additionally, PSIM has a simplified interface compared to other simulators and as a result has a more intuitive interface. MOSFET and Diode Level 2 models were added in the version 10 release. These models allow the simulation of the switch transition, reverse recovery effects, and gate drive circuitry. A comparison with a PSIM & SPICE model of the same device showed similar resulting waveforms with a comparable simulation speed given identical operating conditions. PowerSim recently partnered with CoolCAD Electronics to add CoolSPICE, a SPICE based integrated circuit modeling and design tool, as a bundle option for the PSIM software package.Ferreira, B. (2016). Expanding Power Electronics Activities Across the Globe [President's Message]. IEEE Power Electronics Magazine, 3(1), 6-8. The advantage being that PSIM would then have the flexibility to be able to run SPICE based models and net-lists. Licensing There are various licensing options available for PSIM. There is a free demo version which does not expire but is limited in component count and allowed circuit complexity. The standard/student version allows for the simulation of less complex circuits for a reduced cost. PowerSim does have educational licensing options, some are free, for institutions to address simulation requirements for research and for teaching.

The carriage nearest the engine is a travelling post office van A Travelling Post Office (TPO) is a postal receiving, sorting and delivery service situated on a train, usually in a specially designated carriage that is part of a passenger train. In Queensland, Australia, the service was provided from 1877 to 1932. History The first TPO service in Queensland commenced in 1877 utilising the second class compartments of two composite passenger carriages on the daily Brisbane-to-Dalby train operating on the Main Line and Western railway lines. A goods van was used on the Toowoomba-to -Warwick train operating on the Southern railway line in the same year, until special 4 wheel carriages were built later that year for the service.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 The service was extended to Roma and ultimately Charleville as the Western line was extended, and similarly on the Southern line to Stanthorpe, and then Wallangarra. Mail Trains The first designated 'Mail' train in Queensland was the Brisbane-to-Mitchell day train, with the title being transferred to the overnight service in March 1888 when the line was extended to Charleville. The first overnight service was the Sydney Mail (with First class sleeping carriage) introduced in January 1888 following the opening of the New South Wales line to Wallangarra. It was also the first purely passenger service with a TPO, until then all trains with TPOs had been 'mixed', i.e. carried goods wagons as well as passenger carriages. Second class sleepers were introduced in 1903. In 1885, a TPO was added to the Central West railway line, ultimately extended to Longreach as the line progressively opened. A First class sleeping carriage was introduced on the twice weekly Central West Mail in 1892, departing Rockhampton at 22:00 and reaching Longreach at 17:00 the following day. Second class sleepers were added in 1895. TPOs (and First class sleepers) were introduced to the Townsville-to-Winton service on the Great Northern line in 1899, extending to Mount Isa as that line was opened, and on the North Coast line as far as Maryborough in 1900. Second class sleepers were added to the both lines in 1905. Guards on rural trains had been paid an allowance to accept letters from isolated communities for posting at the nearest town, but the TPOs were staffed by Post Office personnel. TPOs were withdrawn from the North Coast line in 1930 and the other services in 1932 as an economy measure. Despite the loss of the TPO carriages, the services that had hauled them continued to be called Mail Trains, the last being the Dirranbandi Mail, withdrawn from service in 1993. Wooden Sleeping Carriages Following the introduction of The Inlander and subsequent air-conditioned sleeping car services in the 1950s, wooden sleepers cascaded to trains servicing places such as Kingaroy, Monto, Clermont, Springsure, Blackall, Dirranbandi, and returned to the Mount Isa line. Wooden sleeping cars were even added to overnight mixed Rockhampton to Mackay and Townsville to Cairns trains.

The event began as an annual birthday celebration for Nagraj. But the increasing number of fans and participants made the event grow larger every year, and soon the event sprang out of the Raj Comics studios (where it started) and was held at Dilli Haat, Pitampura. The event is popular for being the only convention in India that provides free gifts (including T-shirts, comic books and merchandise) to all the registered attendees. Now it is the second annual comic book convention in New Delhi, after Comic Con India. History In 2008, Raj Comics hosted 3 events namely, Gen-Next Writers Workshop (January 2008), Junoon Mela (June 2008), and Nagraj Janmotsav (4–5 October 2008). Nagraj Janmotsav was the birthday celebration of Raj Comics's flagship character Nagraj. Sanjay Gupta and Manoj Gupta with the host Kshitij Sharma at Nagraj Janmotsav, 2012. What started as a birthday celebration for their flagship character, soon grew into an annual convention attended by several fans and creators. Raj Comics organized the initial events at Rtoonz Studios (Burari). Each year, the event kept growing both in size and space and in 2012, it was held at Dilli Haat, Pitampura. Yahoo, New Delhi, 5 October 2008 In 2013, Raj Comics declared that Nagraj Janmotsav will be celebrated on an even bigger scale and was called Comics Fest India. This new bigger convention showcased stalls by multiple Indian publishing houses, including, but not restricted to, Raj Comics, Tricolor Children Books, Campfire Novels, Holycow Entertainment, Paperclip Books, Rovolt Comics, Fenil Comics and many other publishers. These conventions include many contests, interactive sessions, comics launches, workshops and speeches by various novelists, editors, comic book artists and writers.

Matthews Eugene Simeon Matthews (July 9, 1872 - July 13, 1954) was a Florida politician and newspaperman. He served in the Florida House of Representatives and owned and edited the Bradford County Telegraph for forty years. Early life Matthews was born in Fort Call in Bradford County, Florida, the son of Florida natives W.W. and Ella Liddon Matthews. His father served as a first lieutenant in the Confederate States Army and spent eighteen months as a prisoner at Rock Island Arsenal after being captured at the Battle of Chickamauga. Matthews attended school in Bradford County and Gainesville, Florida and trained in the newspaper business starting at age eleven. Newspaper owner in boomtown Dunellon In 1888, Matthews edited and published the Lake Weir Independent. In 1891, following the discovery of phosphate in Dunnellon, Florida and the subsequent mining boom, Matthews founded the Dunnellon News and served as town clerk. After writing about poor treatment of convicts leased to work in phosphate mines, the resulting pressure and threats from mine owners led Matthews to sell the News and move to Ocala, Florida for work with the Daily Capitol. Move to Starke and entry into politics In January 1893, Matthews moved to Starke, Florida. With Ben J. Farmer, Matthews purchased the Bradford County Telegraph, a newspaper founded in 1879 by William Wyatt Moore. After five years, Farmer sold his interest to Matthews, who edited the Telegraph for forty years. Starting in 1933, his son, Eugene L. Matthews, edited the newspaper for another forty years until retiring and selling the newspaper in 1973. The newspaper is still published today. Matthews was Alderman of Starke from 1897 to 1898. From 1897 to 1898, he was Captain of the Bradford County Guards, which served as Company M of the 1st Florida Volunteer Infantry during the Spanish–American War, but the regiment ventured no further from Florida than Alabama. In 1899, he was promoted to Major and commanded the 2nd battalion of the 2nd Regiment of the Florida State Troops. Election to the state legislature Matthews was elected to the Florida State Legislature in 1904, 1907, 1911 and 1923 and served as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives in 1907. Governor Cary A. Hardee appointed Matthews to the Florida Railroad Commission, where he served from 1924 to 1946. His son credits Matthews with bringing the route of State Road 13 (now U.S. Route 301 and State Road 200) from Tampa, Florida to Jacksonville, Florida through Starke, creating an economic boom there.

What is known of the anatomy is reminiscent of a woodlouse (or onisciform) with 10 segments, each split by two furrows in a midsection, two lateral sections, and it also has two lateral plates. There is no clear distinction between body parts (or tagmata) such as head, trunk and tail, although the frontal segment is rounded anteriorly, and the posterior segments become narrower, the final one ending rounded with a small backward directed spine. Each segment overlaps the front of the following one. There is one median node or spine and two lateral nodes or spines on every segment. Camptophyllia is known from 11 fossils.

At the time of its consecration on November 21, 983, there were fifteen monks. It prospered due to large donations made by earls and lords of the area. From the 12th century, the monastery declined.

In 1592, the priory was converted into the Congregation of Tarragona Claustral and linked to the monastery of Sant Pau del Camp, becoming totally neglected by 1614. Excavation and restoration occurred in the 1980s and 2000s, through Barcelona Provincial Council. Architecture and fittings Crypt The first church was rectangular in shape with three naves separated by columns, a main door on the east side facade, and other building which connected with the monastery. During the 11th century, two semicircular apses were added, the remains of which were found in the excavations of the 1980s. The most important addition occurred in the 12th century which included a platform built in the middle of the nave and beneath it was a crypt adjoining other section various stairwells. Following further reforms in the 18th and 19th centuries, the building was preserved, though half the size of the original. The upper floor is used for worship and the nave has a barrel vault with various windows arches. Only the walls remain of the cloister and monastic rooms. Bibliography * Pladevall, Antoni (2001).

He had been MP here since winning the 1920 Ilford by-election. Election History The constituency was created for the 1918 general election and had been won by Unionists at every election. The Unionists did not come close to losing the seat as the progressive vote had remained evenly split between Liberal and Labour. The result at the last General Election was Candidates Arthur Comyns Carr *On 3 February 1928, the Ilford Unionist Association chose 50-year-old Sir George Hamilton as their candidate to defend the seat.

He was a graduate of Oxford University, where he had been Chairman of the University's Labour Club. *Since John Morris stood down in November 1925, the local Liberals had been without a prospective candidate. On 3 February 1928, the Ilford Liberal Association adopted 45-year- old Arthur Comyns Carr as their candidate to challenge for the seat. He was the prospective candidate for neighbouring Romford. He first stood for election in 1918 in St Pancras South West against a Conservative opponent who had received the Coalition Coupon The Times, 10.12.18 and fought the same seat again in 1922.The Times, 8.11.22 At the 1923 general election he won Islington East turning a Unionist majority of nearly 4,000 The Times, 22.11.23 into a Liberal majority of 1,632 The Times 30.10.24 but he lost the seat at the general election of 1924. He was the son of J. Comyns Carr, a dramatist and art critic. His mother, Alice Laura Strettell (1850–1927) was a novelist. *There were rumours of a fourth candidate, E.A. Hailwood. He had fought the 1927 Southend by-election, the 1928 Faversham by-election and the 1928 Northampton by-election as an Independent Unionist in quick succession. Hailwood had been critical of Stanley Baldwin the Prime Minister. However, at his last outing, he had been threatened with violence by Unionist Party members which may have influenced his non-participation here.Trial By Ballot by Ivor RM Davies When nominations closed on 15 February, it was to reveal a three-cornered contest between the three main parties. Campaign Polling Day was set for 23 February 1928, just 27 days after the death of the former Member of Parliament, allowing for a short campaign. This would have assisted the Labour candidate de Gruchy, as unlike the other two candidates who had only just been selected, he had been in place for 12 months. On 7 February, the King's Speech was read out in parliament, which provided a focus for the issues of the campaign. All three party leaders, Baldwin, Ramsay MacDonald and David Lloyd George sent public letters of support to their own candidates. On 15 February, the former Prime Minister and Liberal Leader H. H. Asquith died. Result The Unionists held the seat, but there was a massive 13.6% swing to the Liberals. The Labour vote share remained the same but the party fell to third place.

The protective wall of the marina is visible in front of the castle. The marina is still in use to this day. The Old Fortress of Corfu (, ) is a Venetian fortress in the city of Corfu. The fortress covers the promontory which initially contained the old town of Corfu that had emerged during Byzantine times. Before the Venetian era the promontory, which lies between the Gulf of Kerkyra to the North and Garitsa Bay to the south, was defended by Byzantine fortifications which the Venetians largely replaced with fortifications of their own design. As part of their defensive plans the Venetians separated the promontory from the rest of the city of Corfu by creating the Contrafossa, a moat which is a sea channel connecting the Gulf of Kerkyra to the North with the Bay of Garitsa to the South, converting the citadel into an artificial island. The fort successfully repulsed all three major Ottoman sieges: the great siege of 1537, the siege of 1571 and the second great siege of Corfu in 1716. The town of Corfu got its Western name from the twin peaks of the fortress (\\"Coryphe\\" in Greek). Origins The church of St. George at the fortress The earliest indication of fortifications on the site presently occupied by the Old Fortress dates from around the 6th century AD, after the destruction of the ancient city of Corcyra by the Goths. The Gothic invasion forced the Corcyreans to seek shelter inside fortifications on the peninsula at the tip of the city. Following a hiatus where no political or military developments in the citadel are known between the 7th-10th centuries AD, the first report of renewed fortifications occurs in early 11th century when Anna Komnene refers to it as the \\"very strongly fortified city of Corfu\\" in her book the Alexiad. The citadel features two peaks which were fortified by strong towers for centuries. The western and higher peak, which is closer to the town, was fortified by the Byzantines around the 12th century AD and was called Castel a Terra or \\"Castle near the Land\\" by the Venetians, who also called it Castel Nuovo or \\"New Castle\\". The eastern peak was called Castel a Mare (Castel by the Sea) or Castel Vecchio (Old Castle) by the Venetians and was also used as powder magazine for a time. The bridge to the city and the Contrafossa. The hill of Castel a Terra is visible to the east of the main gate. Following the Gothic invasion and until the 13th century, the medieval town of Corfu developed within the boundaries of the peninsula which today is occupied by the Old Fortress. In the early 15th century the Venetians started replacing the old Byzantine fortifications. Following the first Siege of Corfu by the Ottomans in 1537, the Venetian Governor ordered the construction of new defensive zones incorporating new bastions and towers which exist to this day. Venetian military engineers Savorgnan and Martinengo designed bastions for the Fortress between 1545 and 1555 which are considered masterpieces of military engineering. As part of their defensive plans for the peninsula of the citadel, and to secure its perimeter, the Venetians created the Contrafossa, a moat which transformed the citadel into an artificial island. The moat exists to this day and is still known to the locals under its Italian name. Since the creation of Contrafossa, access to the citadel was by a drawbridge, which in modern times has been replaced by a permanent one. Ottoman sieges The northern side of Contrafossa opening to the Gulf of Kerkyra. The sea channel separates the citadel from the island of Corfu. The bridge to the city is to the far right. The twin peaks of Castel a Terra and Castel a Mare are visible just above the Contrafossa to the right and left respectively. The fort successfully repulsed all three major Ottoman sieges: the great siege of 1537, the siege of 1571 and the second great siege of Corfu in 1716. Siege of 1537 In 1537, during the Third Ottoman–Venetian War, Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent dispatched a force of 25,000 men under the command of admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa to attack Corfu. The Ottomans landed at Govino Bay, present day Gouvia, and proceeded toward Corfu town, destroying the village of Potamos as they made their way toward the City. The Old Fort, Corfu city's only fortification during that period, and the castle of Angelokastro were the only two places on the island not in the hands of the invaders at the time. In undefended parts of the island, people were killed or captured as slaves by the Sultan's army. The bridge to the fortress as seen from Contrafossa. Even at the Old Fortress, women, children and the elderly, called the inutili (useless) by the Venetians, were turned away and left outside the fort to die or be enslaved. The rejection of the people at the gates angered the Corfiots who lost faith in the effectiveness of Venice's defensive plans. The Corfu fortress was successfully defended by its garrison, as was Angelokastro. As it was retreating from Corfu, the Ottoman army devastated the undefended areas of both Corfu city and the island. In total about 20,000 people who were unable to find shelter in either castle were killed or carried off as slaves. Siege of 1571 The south side of Contrafossa at the bay of Garitsa facing the facilities of the Nautical and Athletic Club of Corfu (NAOK) In August 1571, the Ottomans made another attempt at conquering Corfu. Having seized Parga and Mourtos on the Greek mainland, they attacked the Paxoi islands, landing a force there. An Ottoman force, on its way to the city, first occupied and destroyed the village of Potamos. Although the Corfu city castle stood firm, the rest of Corfu was destroyed and the defenseless civilian population outside the castles suffered heavy casualties. Homes, churches and public buildings were burned in the city suburbs.invenio.lib.auth.gr Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - Psifiothiki/Digital Library quote: The object of the doctoral thesis is the public buildings of Corfu during the venetian rule, 1571-1797\\\\.

In anticipation of the attack, Venice appointed Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg in charge of the defence of the fort. In preparation for the Turkish siege, Schulenburg further strengthened the defences of the Old Fortress. Statue of Count Schulenburg in front of the Fortress On 6 July 1716 Kara Mustafa Pasha brought the Ottoman fleet to Corfu to lay siege to the fort. The Ottomans upon landing in Corfu established themselves in strategic positions and installed artillery situated on the nearby hills of Avrami and Sarocco and started bombarding the citadel. After fierce fighting with the Ottomans during which Schulenburg and the local Corfiote garrison distinguished themselves in battle, the Ottomans finally abandoned their plans of capturing the castle and departed Corfu on 19 August 1716 after a siege which lasted seven weeks. In the aftermath of the siege, the Venetians under Count Schulenburg developed plans to expand the fortifications of the city and a decision was taken to construct new forts atop the Avrami and Sarocco hills to prevent any future bombardment against the old fort. They also built an arsenal at Gouvia to service and repair their fleet. Catastrophe of 1718 Explosion inscription at the Palaio Frourio: \\"IGNIFERIS PILIS CUM PROXIMO LETHALIS PULVERIS CONDITORIO INCENSIS QUAM PLURIMA HOMINUM EDIUM MUNIMUM CEDE CONCUSSIONI RUINA FRANCISCUS FALETRUS PROCONSUL CUNCTIS INI INTEGRUM CELERI CURA RESTITUTIS MILITUM STATIONES ARCIS INGPRESSUM ET VIAM COMMODIUS REFECIT EX S(ENATUS) C(ONSULTO) ANNO MDCCXC\\" In 1718 lightning struck the powder magazine at Castel da Mare causing an explosion which created a chain reaction during which three secondary ammunition facilities also exploded, this in turn destroying most buildings inside the castle including the palace of the Captain General of the fortress, and many city buildings. The Venetian commander of the fortress, Captain Andrea Pisani, brother of the Doge of Venice Alvise Giovanni Mocenigo, was killed along with members of his staff. Hundreds of others died in the explosion, in \\"one of the greatest catastrophes\\" in the history of Corfu. Schulenburg rebuilt the Old Fortress and constructed two new forts on Avrami and Sarocco hills by 1721. These were eventually demolished when Corfu was united with Greece as required by the Treaty of London (1864). Governor of the castle The Fortress and the Bay of Garitsa to the south. The twin peaks Castel a Terra and Castel a Mare are visible. Ships anchored at the marina of the Nautical and Athletic Club of Corfu are in the foreground The governors of the old and new fortresses were elected by the Venetian senate and they were appointed for a period of two years. Both captains were sworn before the senate and part of their oath was never to communicate with each other during their two-year tenure as governors of the fortresses. This was for security reasons in case one captain could persuade the other to commit treason against the republic. Bombardment In 1923 the Old and New Fortresses were bombarded by the Italian Air Force during the Corfu Incident. Nazi occupation The Fortress was used at the end of World War II by the Nazis to imprison the Jews of Corfu prior to their deportation from the island. On 8 June 1944 the Jews of Corfu were told to present themselves the next morning at the old Fort. When they heard the ultimatum, some Jewish people escaped to the countryside of Corfu but most, fearing for their families, went the morning of the 9th of June to the old Fort, as they had been told. There, the Nazis forced them to hand over their jewelry and keys to their properties, and subsequently they were led to the prison inside the Fortress. The incarceration of the Jews at the jail of the castle, under harsh conditions and without rudimentary amenities, lasted for days until finally they were transported to Lefkada and then in succession to Patras, Piraeus and Haidari, after which 1,800 Corfiot Jews were deported to the Birkenau extermination camp via rail. Out of those who were forced to leave Corfu, 120 eventually returned. Modern times Corfu library at Palaio Frourio Hellenic Music Research Lab of the Ionian University at the Old Fortress just behind the castle marina The Fortress houses the Public library of Corfu which is located in the old British barracks.

The original architect of the fort was the military engineer Ferrante Vitelli. The current buildings which exist within the fortress were built by the British during their rule of the island (1815–63). At the top of the castle there is a stone building which was used for defence and a brick building which in modern times functions as the headquarters of the Naval Station of Corfu. The Venetian fortifications were later expanded by the British and the French to help defend against a possible Turkish attack. Its fortifications included 700 pieces of artillery with range estimated as far as the Albanian coast. Origins 1688 diagram of the New Fortress, with later additions shown in colours: red: fort; green: Skarponas Bastion 1728; yellow: Venetian mural monuments In the aftermath of the first great Ottoman siege of Corfu in 1537, the Venetians developed plans to expand the fortifications of the city. Furthermore, due to the great civilian losses, the Corfu city council sent diplomatic representatives to Venice complaining about the lack of fortifications for the parts of the city of Corfu lying outside the walls of the medieval citadel. In response, the Venetians proceeded with works to build walls and fortifications to strengthen the defences of the wider town lying outside the walls of the old citadel. To achieve their goals the Venetians razed 2,000 homes in the suburb of San Rocco, and built new fortifications and walls in their place at great expense. After the fortification works were completed the Venetians built the New Fortress at the hill of St. Mark to further strengthen the defences of the outer city of Corfu and to act as the focal point of the new fortifications. The exact dating of the structure is not established but accounts vary between 1576 or 1577-1588, and 1572-1645. The start date for the construction is also reported as 1577 by Corfiote historian Katsaros. The works had also the effect of widening the defensive perimeter of the old citadel lying inside the Old Fortress. Architectural details New Fortress viewed from north-west The Fortress compound is divided into two levels. In the lower level there is a three- storey building called \\"Punta Perpetua\\" and a bastion of pentagonal shape. Inside the bastion there is a maze of arched chambers, galleries, ventilation shafts, stairs and ramps. The fortress has two baroque-styled gates. Its western side features a dry moat which spans the length of the walls, running from the vegetable market to the new harbour. The moat is a good example of moat architecture. The structure features twin bastions, named Skarponas and Epta Anemoi (\\"Seven Winds\\"),https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5855/ which has a commanding view of the sea and the mountains of mainland Greece. Below the bastion there is a building which was built by the British and functioned as military barracks. Nowadays it houses art exhibits and collections as well as space for social events. The bastion is at a height of 55 m above sea level and features structures such as underground cisterns, powder magazines, artillery positions and underground halls. Governor of the castle The governors of the Old and New Fortresses were elected by the Venetian Senate for a period of two years. Both captains were sworn before the Senate and part of their oath was to never communicate with each other during their two-year tenure as governors of the fortresses. This was for security reasons in case one captain could persuade the other to commit treason against the Republic.

Destruction of fortifications The sea defences of the New Fortress were destroyed by the British when the British protectorate came to an end and Corfu was united with Greece in 1864. Under the same agreement, the Avrami and Vido island forts were also destroyed. When the latter fort was demolished, the explosion was so strong that it broke house windows on the Corfu side of the sea channel. Bombardment In 1923 the New and Old Fortresses were bombarded by the Italian Air Force during the Corfu Incident.

Born in the United Kingdom, Simon Hammond relocated to Australia in 1969, at age seven. He lived in Adelaide with his family through the assisted migration scheme before the family moved to Melbourne. Hammond still resides in Melbourne today. Simon attended Salesian College in Victoria from 1974 to 1979, before studying a Bachelor of Journalism at RMIT in 1980. Director and founder of Hammond Thinking in Melbourne, Australia, Simon Hammond is the author of three books on brand strategy and has founded four brand communications agencies.  Viewpoints  Simon Hammond developed the BE Brand philosophy, maintaining that when a business stands for something based on the emotive drivers of its customer, this will lead to connection and sense of belonging. The BE Brand business strategy process is used in 11 countries across four continents.  Career   Journalism  Simon began his career in Journalism in 1980 as a Cadet reporter at the Knox Sherbrooke News for Leader Newspapers The Leader. In 1982 he joined Mark Day's The Truth in Melbourne where he worked on the investigative team. In 1984 he became Victoria's youngest ever A grade journalist when he took over 4x4 magazine for Syme magazines at age 22. He joined 3AW as Assistant Chief of Staff, before becoming Magazine Development Manager for Syme Magazines in 1986. He ran his own talkback motoring radio show on radio 3UZ for 3 years between 1986 and 1989. In 1988 he established his first brand communications business, Dare Concepts. Since leaving full- time journalism, Simon has been a contributor to The Herald Sun and is a regular commentator on Channel 7's Today Tonight program.  Business Ventures  Simon has established brand communication agencies and methodologies throughout Australia, the USA, Asia, Europe and the UK. After leaving the world of journalism in 1988, Simon established his first communications agency with Robyn, Dare Concepts. Dare was initially founded as a PR company but quickly transitioned into a 'big ideas' advertising agency. Dare was well known for its mould-breaking stunts such as the orchestrated kidnapping of a Victorian minister or breaking the land speed record for a caravan. By 1993, Dare had become a juggernaut in the Melbourne creative industry, gathering large clients like GSK and Land Rover. But wanting to venture increasingly into advertising, Simon founded The Edge gain with wife Robyn Nelson, and new business partner Ron Barnacle. The Edge made a massive splash when it debuted it's still revered 'roo cull' trilogy of ads for youth outreach service 'Open Family'. 'Roo Cull' showed Australian street kids gunned down, 'Cry Wolf' threw street kids to wolves and 'Waltzing Matilda' included a young Australian putting on blackface and receiving more aid as a result. After unresolvable creative differences with partner Ron Barnacle caused Simon to split from The Edge in 1996, Hammond returned to Dare which had been running alongside The Edge and took the reins back from wife Robyn, rebranding it Hammond Dare. The Edge was eventually sold in 2000 and merged with Clemenger Harvie to form Clemenger Harvie Edge, now CHE. As time passed, Hammond Dare received more acclaim and Simon formed an idea to make his agency a destination. So, in 2001 SEE was launched, transitioning clients and staff directly from Hammond Dare. SEE became Hammond's largest and best known agency between its 2001 inception and its 2007 sale to Photon Group (now Enero Group). In this time, Simon found tremendous growth, most notably becoming a published author and developing his most valuable IP - BE Branding. SEE landed massive clients like NAB while creating a creative space that attracted talent from around the country. The business grew large enough to expand into a second location. After selling in 2006, Photon group transitioned SEE into Belong, which would herald a period of change for Simon. His philosophical business model, BE Brands, has been used by business globally since 2003. After briefly helming the new Photon Group-run business for two years, Simon left for greener pastures. This would usher in the end of era, with the 21-year old business in his rear view mirror, it would be another 10 years before Simon fronted a creative agency. In the years since, he co-founded Bastion Brands in 2009 and The Be Counsel in 2010 as well as his one-man operation Hammond Thinking in 2012. Now under Bastion Collective, Bastion Brands continues to be a huge success without Simon's involvement. Similarly The Be Counsel ran for many years with Simon as a silent partner, and it wasn't until 2018 that Simon stepped up to helm the agency. In November 2019, Simon began his newest business venture 50 Crates. Focusing on the use of the BE Branding philosophy in conjunction with the Socratic method, 50 Crates aims to challenge business leaders by \\"asking the questions that are hard to ask\\" and transitions The Be Counsel into Simon's biggest creative venture since SEE in 2001. Hammond's new creative studio and event centre is set to open mid 2020 in Graham Street, Port Melbourne.  Writing  Simon Hammond has authored three books on the BE Brand philosophy. Guts: All It Takes To Be Successful In Business (and Life) In 2004, Zatzit Pty Ltd published Hammond’s first book, ‘Guts’. This book explores his business manifesto and personal development. He explains his formula to success using a range of powerful social insights (SINS). The production of Guts led to the formulation of BE Brands. BE Brands: Simon Hammond’s Creative Brand Revolution In 2006, Wiley Books published Hammond’s second book, BE Brands. The namesake of Hammond’s brand philosophy, this book examines brave brands that have emerged “in a world of risk aversion and corporate blandness”. Focused on the future of customer-centric businesses, Hammond uses popular culture observations, consumer behaviour insights and practical experience to establish the top twenty brands in Australia and what can be learnt from their business transformations. CEO of Earth: A Ground-Breaking Guide to Building the Ultimate Brand In 2009, Wright Books published Hammond’s third book, CEO of Earth. In contrast to Hammond’s non-fiction publications, CEO of Earth is a fictional tale of an advertising intern, Fysh Reynolds, mistaken as the ‘leader of Earth’ by some tourist traders from another planet. Before he can explain the misunderstanding, Reynolds finds himself in charge of tourism for planet Earth. This tale of branding the ultimate product illustrates how textbook approaches to marketing might work on the biggest brand conceivable and what ‘old school’ methods would need to change for Earth to be the universal brand of choice. In 2013, CEO of Earth was translated into Spanish and became digitally available in ibooks and kindle.  Speaking  Simon Hammond is a frequent keynote speaker, with appearances at The Melbourne International Fashion Festival and Melbourne International Business Forum. Hammond is also the creator and producer of Lectern Rock. Launched in 2008, Lectern Rock is a theatrical rock seminar program, designed to change the way audiences are engaged on business topics. This program toured Australia four times between 2008 and 2011, seen by over 10,000 businesses in Australia. Lectern Rock is known as Podium Rock outside of Australia and has toured the USA.  Community Work  Simon Hammond has been active in community and charitable pursuits. He took on pro bono work for Anglicare and Open Family.The Canberra Times, Friday 4 June 1993The Canberra Times, Thursday 26 May 1994The Canberra Times, Tuesday 1 June 1993 Hammond also spent time as a board member of Open Family from 1993 - 1995. Hammond worked for Lifeline for seven years as both a counselor and trainer. In 1975 he was honoured with a Queen Scout award. Hammond was awarded the inaugural literary award at Salesian college in 1979.

Indian Lake Estates is located on the eastern shore of Lake Weohyakapka (Lake Walk-in-Water), east-southeast of Lake Wales. History El Dorado Estates, Inc. was incorporated in January 1955, with Washington, D.C. real estate developer Leon Ackerman as its only shareholder. In October 1955, the company's name was changed to Indian Lake Estates, Inc. and it purchased a large tract of undeveloped land on the shores of Lake Walk-in-Water, about 19 miles southeast of Lake Wales. The company purchased the 12-square-mile tract for $222,000, or roughly $35 per acre. Ackerman envisioned an exclusive gated community of 15,000 residents, complete with golf course, country club, marina, and pier on Lake Walk-in-Water. In December 1955, the first plat of the 7,200-acre community was recorded at the county courthouse. The company invested millions to build a network of canals near the lake, a quarter-mile pier, and 200 miles of roads throughout the development, of which 98 miles are paved. Prices for half-acre lots in the community started at $2,250. However, most of the buyers of plots were land speculators and only about 150 homes were built in the initial years after the community was founded. By 1959, financial problems seemed imminent and the following year Ackerman sold his interest in the company to Alaska Oil & Mineral Company, Inc. However, the Indian Lake Estates, Inc. went bankrupt in April 1965. As of 2009, there are about 700 homes, mostly near the lake or golf course, on the community's over 8,000 lots.

He received his medical degrees from the University College London and the University of London, graduating in 1854. Between 1855 and 1860 he worked as an assistant physician at the Great Ormond Street Hospital for sick children. In 1858 he also became a member of the Royal College of Physicians of London, and opened his own practice at Gower Street. Between 1861 and 1968 he worked as physician at the London Fever Hospital. In 1866 Buchanan was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of London, where he served as censor (1892–1894) and Lettsomian lecturer (1867). He was president of the Epidemiological Society (1881–1883), and in 1882 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. Buchanan was mostly noted for his public health service. In 1856 he was made first medical officer to St Giles, which held the highest death rate among London districts. Based on his observations there he wrote several highly praised reports on the causes and prevention of infectious deceases, eventually becoming a national authority in the field. In particular, his work on vaccination against smallpox led to the Vaccination Act of 1867, and his notes on the causes of typhus during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1862 helped fight the decease in Liverpool and Warrington in the late 1860s and eventually eradicate it nationwide after 1870s. Buchanan reasonably attributed the spread of typhus to overcrowding and squalor in big cities. He later noted that reducing soil dampness through drainage works reduced mortality from respiratory tuberculosis. In 1869 Buchanan was appointed as a permanent inspector at the medical department of the Privy Council, and in 1879 as the Chief Medical Officer of the United Kingdom. He resigned from that post in April 1892, when he was knighted, and became Chairman of the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis. Buchanan remained connected with the University College London throughout his whole life, being elected a fellow in 1864, and serving as a member of the council. He helped secure the admission of women to the University College and University of London. Buchanan also played an active part in the affairs of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries, first as a member and then an assistant. In 1893 he was made an honorary LL.D. of the University of Edinburgh. In 1897 the Royal Society started awarding a gold medal every five years (now reduced to two years) for services to sanitary science. The medal was named the Buchanan Medal in his honour and featured his bust on the obverse. Buchanan's works have not been collected and are scattered through various official reports. Family Buchanan was married twice, first to Mary Murphy and then in 1865 to Alice Mary Asmar. Asmar was the daughter of Edward Cator Seaton, a colleague of Buchanan and his predecessor as the Chief Medical Officer. Buchanan died of heart failure while recovering from heart surgery in 1895 and was buried at Brookfield Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife and two sons and four daughters from two marriages. His elder son, Sir George Seaton Buchanan, also became a renowned physician and epidemiologist. His daughter Alice Lillian Buchanan married Rev George Adam Smith.http://www.glasgowwestaddress.co.uk/1909_Glasgow_Men/Smith_Rev_George_Adam.htm See also * Buchanan Medal References *Hardy, Anne (2004) \\"Buchanan, Sir George (1831–1895)\\" in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press * 1831 births 1895 deaths People from Islington (district) 19th-century English medical doctors Chief Medical Officers for England Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians Fellows of the Royal Society Knights Bachelor Medical doctors from London ","title":"George Buchanan (physician)"},{"id":"41202620","text":"Gary Odgers (born 15 December 1959) is a former Australian rules footballer who played with St Kilda in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

The Barony of Drayton was created during Simon de Montfort's Parliament in 1264 but the validity of the summons and appointments have been debated over the subsequent centuries.

Drug pollution is therefore mainly a form of water pollution. \\"Pharmaceutical pollution is now detected in waters throughout the world,\\" said a scientist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, New York. \\"Causes include aging infrastructure, sewage overflows and agricultural runoff. Even when wastewater makes it to sewage treatment facilities, they aren't equipped to remove pharmaceuticals.\\"  Sources and effects  Most simply from the drugs having been cleared and excreted in the urine. The portion that comes from expired or unneeded drugs that are flushed unused down the toilet is smaller, but it is also important, especially in hospitals (where its magnitude is greater than in residential contexts). This includes drug molecules that are too small to be filtered out by existing water treatment plants. The process of upgrading existing plants to use advanced oxidation processes that are able to remove these molecules can be expensive. Drugs such as antidepressants have been found in the United States Great Lakes. Researchers from the University of Buffalo have found high traces of antidepressants in the brains of fish. Fish behavior on antidepressants have been noted to have similar impacts and reducing risk-averse behavior, and thereby reducing survival through predation. Other sources include agricultural runoff (because of antibiotic use in livestock) and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Drug pollution is implicated in the sex effects of water pollution. It is a suspected a contributor (besides industrial pollution) in fish kills, amphibian dieoffs, and amphibian pathomorphology. Prevention The main action for preventing drug pollution is to incinerate unwanted pharmaceutical drugs. Burning them chemically degrades their active molecules, with few exceptions. The resulting ash can be further processed before landfilling, such as to remove and recycle any heavy metals that may be present. There are now programs in many cities that provide collection points at places including drug stores, grocery stores, and police stations. People can bring their unwanted pharmaceuticals there for safe disposal, instead of flushing them (externalizing them to the waterways) or throwing them in the trash (externalizing them to a landfill, where they can become leachate). Another aspect of drug pollution prevention is environmental law and regulation, although this faces the problems of enforcement costs, enforcement corruption and negligence (see below), and, where enforcement succeeds, increased costs of doing business. The lobbying of pros and cons is ongoing. Manufacturing One extreme example of drug pollution was found in India in 2009 in an area where pharmaceutical manufacturing activity is concentrated. Not all pharmaceutical manufacturing contributes to the problem. In places where environmental law and regulation are adequately enforced, the wastewater from the factories is cleaned to a safe level. But to the extent that the market rewards \\"looking the other way\\" in developing nations, whether through local corruption (bribed inspectors or regulators) or plausible deniability, such protections are circumvented. This problem belongs to everyone, because consumers in well-regulated places constitute the biggest customers of the factories that operate in the inadequately regulated or inspected places, meaning that externality is involved.

Slack offers many IRC-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. History Slack began as an internal tool for Stewart Butterfield's company Tiny Speck during the development of Glitch, an online game. Slack launched in August 2013. In March 2015, Slack announced it had been hacked over four days in February 2015, and that some data associated with user accounts had been compromised, including email addresses, usernames, hashed passwords, phone numbers, and Skype IDs. In response to the attacks, Slack added two-factor authentication to its service. Slack was previously compatible with non-proprietary Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and XMPP messaging protocols, but the company closed the corresponding gateways in May 2018. \\"Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge\\" is a backronym for \\"Slack\\". On April 26, 2019, Slack went public without an IPO and saw its shares soar to $21 billion valuation. Features Slack offers many IRC-style features, including persistent chat rooms (channels) organized by topic, private groups, and direct messaging. Content, including files, conversations, and people, is all searchable within Slack. Users can add emoji buttons to their messages, on which other users can then click to express their reactions to messages. Slack's free plan allows only the 10,000 most recent messages to be viewed and searched. On March 18, 2020, Slack redesigned its platform to simplify and customize the user experience. Teams Slack teams allow communities, groups, or teams to join a \\"workspace\\" via a specific URL or invitation sent by a team admin or owner. Although Slack was developed for professional and organizational communication, it has been adopted as a community platform, replacing message boards or social media groups. Messaging Public channels allow team members to communicate without the use of email or group SMS (texting). Public channels are open to everyone in the workspace. Private channels allow for private conversation between smaller sub-groups. These private channels can be used to organize large teams. Direct messages allow users to send private messages to specific users rather than a group of people. Direct messages can include up to nine people. Once started, a direct message group can be converted into a private channel. Integrations Slack integrates with many third-party services and supports community-built integrations, including Google Drive, Trello, Dropbox, Box, Heroku, IBM Bluemix, Crashlytics, GitHub, Runscope, Zendesk and Zapier. In December 2015, Slack launched their software application (\\"app\\") directory, consisting of over 150 integrations that users can install. In March 2018, Slack announced a partnership with financial and human capital management firm Workday. This integration allows Workday customers to access Workday features directly from the Slack interface. API Slack provides an application programming interface (API) for users to create applications and automate processes, such as sending automatic notifications based on human input, sending alerts on specified conditions, and automatically creating internal support tickets. Slack's API has been noted for its compatibility with many types of applications, frameworks, and services. Platforms Slack provides mobile apps for iOS and Android in addition to their Web browser client and desktop clients for macOS, Windows (with versions available from the company's website and through the Windows Store), and Linux (beta). Slack is also available for the Apple Watch, allowing users to send direct messages, see mentions, and make simple replies. It was featured on the home screen of the Apple Watch in a 2015 promotional video. Slack has been made to run on a Super Nintendo Entertainment System via Satellaview. Business model Slack is a freemium product, whose main paid features are the ability to search more than 10,000 archived messages and add unlimited apps and integrations. They claim support for an unlimited number of users. When freeCodeCamp attempted to switch its community of over 8,000 users to Slack in 2015, however, they experienced many technical issues and were advised by Slack support to limit their channels to \\"no more than 1,000 users (ideally more like 500)\\". That specific limit no longer applied by January 2017. On July 26, 2018, Atlassian announced the shutdown of its competing HipChat and Stride, effective February 11, 2019, and the sale of their intellectual property to Slack, with Slack to assume the user bases of the services. The companies also announced a commitment to work on integration of Slack with Atlassian services. In July 2020, Slack acquired Rimeto, a startup company focused on directory building. This acquisition will provide additional search offerings of employees within a Slack workspace. Reception 8,000 customers signed up for the service within 24 hours of its launch in August 2013. In February 2015, the company reported that approximately 10,000 new daily active users had signed up each week, and had more than 135,000 paying customers spread across 60,000 teams. By April 2015, those numbers had grown to 200,000 paid subscribers and a total of 750,000 daily active users. Late in 2015, Slack passed more than a million daily active users. , Slack had over 8 million daily users, 3 million of whom had paid accounts. At the time of its S-1 filing for IPO, dated April 26, 2019, Slack reported more than 10 million daily active users from more than 600,000 organizations, located in more than 150 countries. In March 2015, the Financial Times wrote that Slack was the first business technology to have crossed from business into personal use since Microsoft Office and the BlackBerry. In 2017, New York magazine criticized the platform for being \\"another utility we both rely on and resent.\\" In 2017, Slack was recognized as the best startup of the year at the Crunchies Awards, organized by TechCrunch. The digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has cautioned that \\"Slack stores and is able to read all of your communications, as well as identifying information for everyone in your workspace\\". While commending the company for \\"follow[ing] several best practices in standing up for users\\" concerning government data requests, such as requiring a warrant for content stored on its server, and awarding it four out of five stars in its 2017 \\"Who has your back\\" report, the EFF also criticized Slack for \\"a broad set of exceptions\\" to its promise to notify users of such requests, and for other privacy shortcomings. Criticism Slack has been criticized by users for storing user data exclusively on cloud servers under Slack control. This is found to be a particular issue for users with large teams, who experienced issues with connectivity within the app, access to archived messages, and the number of users for a given \\"workspace\\". Slack has additionally been criticized for a retroactive 2018 change to their privacy policy, allowing access to all public and private chat messages by workspace administrators, without the need of consent from any parties using the app. According to the policy, Slack users would not be notified when their information is being accessed. Other notable issues include being criticized as addictive, an inhibitor to productivity, and showing personal information such as an email to other users by default.

She has previously served as the board's chair. Career Libby Garvey attended Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, where she earned a bachelor's degree. Her professional career began as a teacher in the Central African Republic with the Peace Corps. In 1999 Garvey was elected to the Arlington County's Board of Education and served for 15 (non-consecutive) years. During that time, she served as chairwoman five times. Robert G. Smith, who served as the Board's most senior administrator for most of her tenure, described a key exchange they had when he was being interviewed for the job of supervisor. He said they discussed the common attitude that those students coming from an impoverished family background, were predetermined to have low academic performance. In a book Smith wrote, describing how he turned around the County's student's academic performance, he described Garvey challenging him to disprove the common misconception. In 2011 she ran an unsuccessful bid for a seat in the Virginia State Senate. Arlington County Board and the Columbia Pike Streetcar Garvey was first elected to the Arlington County Board in March 2012 and was reelected in November 2016. She later served in parent-teacher associations of Abingdon and Dew elementary schools and the H-B Woodlawn program. She has been vice president of the County Council of PTAs, vice president of the Fairlington Civic Association and vice chairwoman of the Advisory Council on Instruction. Democratic Gov. Mark Warner appointed Garvey to serve on the Education Council, an appointment that was later continued by Democratic Gov. Tim Kaine. The Columbia Pike Streetcar was a plan to build a streetcar through Columbia Pike, connecting Pentagon City in Arlington County, to Skyline Plaza in Fairfax County. As cost estimates skyrocketed, the plan became controversial. In a firehouse caucus, Garvey won the Democratic nomination for the Arlington County Board seat. Since Arlington is considered a heavily Democratic county, it was widely expected that the winner of the caucus would prevail in the general election. Garvey wanted to see a cost analysis of the program before supporting or opposing the streetcar, while her main opponent was an enthusiastic supporter. Garvey's win was attributed to voters who sought an independent voice on the County Board. When Garvey announced her opposition to the streetcar, she found herself at odds with local Democratic party members who supported the plan. In 2014 tension grew to anger when she endorsed and helped raise campaign funds for John Vihstadt, who sought an open seat on the Arlington County Board. Vihstadt, a Republican ran as an independent in a special election to replace board member Chris Zimmerman, who retired from the board in January. Garvey defended her support of Vihstadt because he shared her views on the streetcar. Garvey said that she felt her responsibility to the voters who elected her outweighed her obligations to local party politics. Arlington County Democratic Committee Chairman Kip Malinosky, said he received numerous complaints of Garvey's public support of Vihstadt who defeated Democrat Alan Howse in the special election. As a result, in April 2014, Garvey was forced from the party's leadership committee, but has since returned. The special election only guaranteed Vihstadt a seat on the board until the end of the year, when Zimmerman's term was to have ended. In November 2014, Vihstadt and Howse would once again faced off for the open seat. Garvey, now political allies with Vihstadt continued to support his efforts to win a full four-year term. The election was viewed by many as a referendum on the streetcar. Vihstadt was able to use the streetcar and tap into growing voter resentment over what he called \\"vanity projects\\" such as an aquatics center, an over-budget dog park and an infamous \\"million dollar bus stop and won the election handily. Board members Jay Fisette and Mary Hynes, both strong supporters of the streetcar, realized they could not persuade the majority of voters to support the project. The project was officially halted on November 18. The acrimony of the cancellation was apparent immediately after the vote when Fisette refused to shake hands with Garvey. The simmering tensions over the project was highly unusual because of Arlington's commitment to both courtesy and consensus. In June 2016 Garvey easily defeated challenger Erik Gutshall in a local Democratic Party Primary which was a rare challenge to unseat an incumbent's bid to win reelection Garvey's alienation of the \\"fading Democratic Establishment\\" led to what one veteran election-watch described as an \\"unprecedented onslaught\\" consisting of \\"a coalition of current and former elected officials and Democratic activists\\" who were angered and sought to unseat her for supporting Vhidstat and for displaying an independent streak. Personal life Garvey has lived in Arlington since 1977. She has two daughters, both of whom are graduates of Arlington County Public Schools, and five grandchildren. She established the Kennan Garvey Memorial Fund for Phoenix Bikes in memory of her late husband, and has served on their board.

Measurements of this type cannot be done using Earth-based telescopes because Earth's atmosphere absorbs most UV light before it reaches the ground. Objectives The Venus Spectral Rocket Experiment (VeSpR) collected data on 27 November 2013, on the escape of water from Venus' atmosphere during the flight of the suborbital rocket. The sounding rocket carried the telescope above most of Earth's atmosphere where it could observe ultraviolet light from Venus that would normally be absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. Total flight time was less than 10 minutes, and the telescope can be recovered and reused. Sounding rocket VeSpR is a two-stage system, combining a Terrier missile – originally built as a surface-to-air missile and later repurposed to support science missions – and a Black Brant model Mk1 sounding rocket with a telescope inside developed by the Center for Space Physics at Boston University. Integration took place at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. The Terrier stage fires for only 6 seconds after launch before it burns out and separates from the Mk 1, having accelerating from zero to 2100 km/hr (1300 mph). The Black Brant coasts upward for 6 seconds, before firing for about 30 seconds, taking the payload to a speed of over 7800 km/hr (4800 mph). At that point the rocket is 46 km high, but it already has enough speed to coast upward for almost four more minutes, reaching its peak of 300 km (186 miles) before starting its descent back to Earth. The payload made its final descent with a parachute and touch down about 80 km (50 miles) downrange of the launch site, where it can be recovered. Science The upper atmospheres of all three terrestrial planets are slowly evaporating into space, with the highest loss rate for the lightest atom, hydrogen. At Venus, solar UV radiation penetrates into the middle atmosphere, where photodissociation of H2O by solar UV radiation releases H and O, which diffuse into the upper atmosphere and eventually reach the exobase. The H atoms may be lost into space, while relatively fewer O atoms escape, mainly due to non- thermal processes. Understanding the details of escape today is a requirement to be able to extrapolate into the past to learn the history of Venusian water. The atmosphere of Venus is known to have undergone substantial evolution over geologic time. Evidence for this includes the present remarkable contrast between Venus’ atmosphere and the Earth's: Venus has very little water, a 95% CO2 atmosphere, a surface temperature of 750 K, and a surface pressure of 90 bar. The early Venusian atmosphere is thought to have undergone either a moist or runaway greenhouse heating episode to produce these conditions, and this would have included hydrodynamic escape of light gases from the upper atmosphere to deplete possibly as much as an ocean of water. Support for this scenario comes from the measured ratio of D/H in Venus' atmosphere of roughly 1.6% from the Pioneer Venus mass spectrometer, orbiting ion mass spectrometer (OIMS) data, and IR spectra of the night-side atmosphere. This large enhancement over cosmic abundances is consistent with the loss of an ocean's worth of H2O over geologic time. Telescope The VeSpR telescope is a special-purpose Cassegrain design to accomplish observations that other missions are not able to perform. The use of a pre- dispersing prism to prevent long wavelengths from entering the spectrograph permits a long-aperture approach to echelle spectroscopy, and the chosen combination of imaging and dispersion scales provides high spectral resolution of emission line profiles with a several arc sec wide aperture for good sensitivity. For comparable spectral resolution the HST/STIS uses a 0.2 arc sec aperture, which provides 375 times less solid angle on the sky than a 3 x 5 arc sec region observed by this rocket telescope. For comparison, the ratio of telescope areas HST/rocket is roughly 50 times. With equivalent efficiencies, Hubble Space Telescope would need 4 hours of observing time to achieve the same S/N that the rocket obtains in 5 minutes. However, Hubble telescope is not allowed to point too close to the Sun to avoid damaging its instruments, so it cannot be used for this. The VeSpR telescope is a Cassegrain design with a Dall-Kirkham figure, and with a 35 cm diameter ellipsoidal primary and a spherical secondary mirror providing 1–2 arc sec image quality within a few arc min of the optic axis. The telescope delivers a f/21 beam to the focal plane with a plate scale of 26 arc sec/mm. The spectrograph has been designed and constructed for UV echelle line profile measurements with long-slit imaging. The Ebert-Fastie configuration employed in the design of the spectrograph has many characteristics well suited to the science needs of this mission. Symmetric off-axis reflections from a single collimating mirror are employed to remove aberrations: the spatial resolution is limited by the telescope and the spectral resolution by the grating and aperture characteristics. Use of a paraboloidal collimator, has produced 2 arc sec image quality with minimal astigmatism along the central 2–3 arc min. A 2 deg. magnesium fluoride (MgF2) objective prism mounted forward of the aperture plate is used to disperse the converging beam from the telescope: with the 1216 Å image focused onto the primary aperture, other wavelengths are excluded from the spectrograph producing a very low level of scattered light on the detector. The spectrograph uses a replica of a prototype grating for the Hubble Space Telescope STIS. For a 5 arc sec aperture width, the measured resolution in the last flight was 0.055 Å FWHM. A camera is included to re- image the focal plane onto a separate detector, providing an image of the telescope field of view minus the light which passes through the spectrograph aperture. The Venus image on the aperture plate will be sufficiently dispersed by the objective prism that the Ly α image will be clearly separated from the longer wavelength continuum and emissions.

(17 December 2009) The U.S.–UAE 123 Agreement for Peaceful Civilian Nuclear Energy Cooperation is a 123 Agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States of America and the United Arab Emirates, which entered into force on 17 December 2009 and enables the UAE to receive nuclear know-how, materials and equipment from the U.S. As part of the agreement, the UAE committed to forgo domestic uranium enrichment and reprocessing of spent fuel, as well as sign the International Atomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol, which institutes a more stringent inspections regime on the UAE's nuclear activities. The UAE's agreement to forgo enrichment and reprocessing has become known as the nonproliferation \\"gold standard\\" for nuclear cooperation agreements, because the signatory renounces the sensitive technology and capabilities that can also be used to produce a nuclear weapon. Background On 15 January 2009, pursuant to Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan first signed a proposed bilateral agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation at the close of the George W. Bush administration. Once the Barack Obama administration took office, the U.S. and UAE reopened the text for negotiation. On 21 May 2009, Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg and UAE Ambassador to the United States Yousef Al Otaiba signed a new version of the agreement. On the same day, the Obama administration submitted the proposed agreement to U.S. Congress, which had the opportunity to review the proposed agreement until 17 October 2009, a period of 90 days of continuous session.

His restaurant has earned three Michelin stars, the first being awarded in 2010.  Early life  Goujon was born in Bourges in the department of Cher. His father was a fighter pilot, and while growing up he lived in Marrakesh in Morocco, in Germany, and in Metz. After his father's early death, the family moved to Béziers. Goujon had little taste for school and became a waiter in a restaurant, which formed his decision to become a cook.  Career  In 1977, he began an apprenticeship with the railway company Chemins de fer du Midi in the former restaurant at the Gare de Béziers. He was awarded the best apprentice in the region of Languedoc- Roussillon. In 1981, he became an assistant chef under the Rouquette brothers at Ragueneau, also in Béziers. There in 1983 he met his mentor Roger Vergé, who hired him as an assistant chef in his three-starred restaurant Moulin de Mougins. Four months later he was made responsible for the fish department. He stayed there for four years, discovering all the subtleties and the flavors of the regional cuisine. In 1987, he moved to Marseille, where he became sous chef under Jean-Paul Passédat, at that time in charge of the two-starred restaurant Le Petit Nice. This gave him training in rigorous preparation. Two years later, in 1989, he became sous chef under Gérard Clor at the one-starred restaurant L'Escale in Carry-le-Rouet. He stayed there for three years and helped win a second Michelin star for the restaurant.  L'Auberge du Vieux Puits  In 1992, Goujon started his own restaurant in Fontjoncouse, a small, isolated village in the department of Aude, with approximately one hundred inhabitants. The mayor had decided that the only way the village could survive was by creating a destination restaurant, and had constructed the inn with public money, adapting an old stable. Unfortunately every operator of the establishment failed to make money. At the same time, Goujon had decided that he would have his own restaurant by the time he was 30. Not having much money, he and his wife Marie-Christine began looking, but could not find anything suitable that they could afford. Then they received a telephone call from the Mayor of Fontjoncouse, offering them the inn, whose third failed tenant had just left. They went there to look at it, were charmed by the location, and bought it for 34,000 €. It took considerable work to fix it up and make it a pleasant restaurant. For five years, the restaurant was virtually empty, few diners venturing out into the garrigue to visit it. Then weekenders began to arrive, and other restaurateurs suggested to Goujon that he enter the Meilleur Ouvrier de France professional competition; he did so and won the title in 1996, which made him famous. In 1997, Gault Millau rated him 14 out of 20 and the Bottin Gourmand awarded him a star. The Michelin Guide gave him his first star the same year. In 2001, he received his second Michelin star for his abilities as a chef and his innovation. In 2010, he received his third Michelin star, the only new chef to receive the distinction in that edition. The cuisine at L'Auberge du Vieux Puits focuses on local foods, featuring simple ingredients such as cabbages, tomatoes and seasonal vegetables, lamb, goat, seasonal game (boar, hare, quail, and woodcock), pork from the Bigorre black pig, pigeon, picholine olives, rosemary, basil, cod, apples, potatoes (for example the Pays de Sault variety) and figs.

It was completed in 1215 in Aachen at the command of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Previously, Charlemagne's remains had been in the Palatine Chapel part of the cathedral until 1165, when Frederick Barbarossa placed the remains in a sarcophagus beneath the floor of the cathedral. Frederick II personally carried out the transfer of the bones and the sealing of the shrine on 27 July 1215, the first anniversary of the Battle of Bouvines, which had spurred him to seek the German throne. Two days before, he had been crowned again and finally as the King of the Romans at Aachen.  Construction  The Shrine is part of the late 12th century shrine tradition. It has the form of a naved church, without a transept. It is an oak box more than two metres long, decorated with gilt silver, gilt copper, filigree, precious stones, enamel and firnisbrand. The double step of the base is adorned with enamel plates, engravings, filigree, and silver stamped with floral designs. The two long sides each show an arcade of eight archways resting on double columns, in which the kings and emperors of the realm are enthroned. The front gable end shows Charlemagne enthroned, with Pope Leo III standing to his right and Archbishop Turpin of Rheims to his left. A half- figure of Christ is located in a medaillon above Charlemagne. On the rear gable end the Madonna with Christ is enthroned between the Archangels Michael and Gabriel. Three half-figures, the personifications of Faith, Hope, and Love, are depicted above. The two surfaces of the roof show four reliefs with scenes from the romanticised life of Charlemagne. A crest of gilded copper, with five towers, decorates the ridge and gable of the roof. Each of the long sides of the shrine depicts eight enthroned emperors. Shown on its right side, as viewed from the front gable end, are the following (from left to right): Henry II, Otto III, Otto I, Otto II, Charles the Fat, an unnamed Emperor, Henry VI, and Frederick II. Depicted on the opposite side are Henry III, Zwentibold, Henry V, Henry IV, Otto IV, Henry I, Lothair I, and Louis the Pious.  The iconographic concept  The composition is determined by Hohenstaufen imperial thought. Charlemagne is enthroned on the front between the representatives of the church at a location which is reserved on all other shrines for Christ alone. He himself, Emperor Charlemagne, is the viceroy of Christ, towering over the Pope and the archbishop. On the two long sides of the shrine, otherwise reserved for Prophets and Apostles, sixteen Holy Roman Emperors and Kings are enthroned, the roof reliefs continue the imperial character of the composition. These show the legendary life of Charlemagne, based on the Historia Karoli Magni et Rothalandi, allegedly written by Archbishop Turpin of Rheims (c. 748-749). However, modern research has revealed that the Historia Karoli was actually composed around 1130-1140 in France.  Anthropological investigation  In 1874, the Aachen Stiftkapitel allowed a scientific investigation of the remains of Charlemagne to be carried out by Hermann Schaaffhausen (1816-1893), an anthropologist from Bonn. From the remains Schaafhausen determined a height of 2.04 metres. This height, which was especially rare in the Middle ages, was reported by Einhard, \\"for it is known that in height he measured seven of his feet\\" (nam septem suorum pedum proceritatem eius constat habuisse mensuram). The right collarbone had broken and rehealed. No historian mentions this injury. The skull shows a dolichocephalic form (elongated), the seams closed without a trace, which is a sign of old age. The findings indicate the authenticity of the remains.  Inventory and securing, 1983–88  On 30 January 1983, during a vespers service, the sealed zinc box with the remains of Charlemagne was taken out of the shrine and opened. In the evening of the same day, the box was resealed and the remains were put in a provisional wooden shrine. At night, the Karlsschrein itself was brought into the cathedral goldsmiths' workshop, where the goldsmiths Gerhard Thewis and Peter Bolg worked for five years under the scholarly direction of Herta Lepie on the conservation of the artwork. Here, care was taken that apart from this conservation a restoration or renovation was not made – as frequently happened in the repair of artworks in the past – which would have irreversibly changed the shrine or damaged its original form.

Hand-Made Gramophones Limited was founded in 1923 by Ellis Michael Ginn (whose initials gave the firm its name). Its object was to build and sell high class acoustical gramophones. E.M.G.'s first model was the Magnaphone, demonstrated and sold in Brighton in March 1924. Following the Brighton success, the firm moved to London. In the Steinway Hall Gramophone Tests of June 14, 1924, sponsored by Gramophone Magazine, E.M.G.'s Magnaphone was awarded the Silver Medal. Following these Tests, Compton Mackenzie, editor of the Gramophone Magazine wrote that \\"it is an instrument with a very big future before it\\". At the Gramophone Congress of 1925 held in Caxton Hall, E.M.G. won the Bronze Medal. In 1928, Frederick Delius wrote to Ginn to congratulate him on the E.M.G.

For those, instruments like the Expert, the E.M.G. and the Cascade are a wonderful substitute for the electric wonders of today.” Francis James expands this explanation: \\"[W]hat could be more nostalgic [for British colonial officers] than an E.M.G. playing Elgar under the black velvet of a night on the African Veldt? It was not just colonial officers who ordered them, of course.

History The governorate was originally created on 5 February 1919 on orders of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs Kliment Voroshylov and the same day confirmed by the Council of People's Commissars of Ukraine. It was created on eastern territories of Yekaterinoslav Governorate including counties of Bakhmut and Slovianoserbsk. Due to invasion of Anton Denikin troops the guberniya was dissolved in summer of 1919 and its territory was part of the South Russia, the Russian White South. With the defeat of the Denikin's armies, the governorate was under special jurisdiction of Donets Gubernatorial Executive Committee, while revival of local economy was conducted by the Ukrainian Industrial Bureau. On 15 March 1920 new administrative border contours were confirmed by the head of Ukrainian Soviet Labour Army, Iosif Stalin. On 23 March 1920 recreation of the region was confirmed by the Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR). In April 1920 the Donets Governorate was reestablished from the eastern portions of Yekaterinoslav and Kharkov Governorates as well as territories of the liquidated Don Republic. After defeat of Denikin, in the region were formed Bolshevik \\"ChON\\" detachments (special purpose detachments) of local Communist and Komsomol activists who fought against their former allied Makhno formations (so called \\"local banditry\\"). The struggle against so called \\"Makhnovshchina\\" continued until 1922. In the fall of 1920, White guards armies of Pyotr Wrangel were conducting some military operations against the Workers and Peasants Red Army (RKKA). During this period the gubernatorial seat was relocated from Luhansk to Bakhmut (which in 1924 was renamed Artemivsk). Following the retreat of White Guards from the region, Donets Governorate was visited by Leon Trotsky who on 19 November 1920 wrote to Lenin, To fight famine in the region, a big help was received from such international organizations like the American Relief Administration, the Fridtjof Nansen's mission of the International Red Cross, and the Workers International Relief. Despite protests from the local gubernatorial administration, in February 1924 a big portion of the region's south including such cities like Taganrog and Shakhty was passed on to the newly created South-Eastern Oblast of the Russian SFSR. In return, the Ukrainian SSR insignificant territorial gains in area of Sloboda Ukraine near Grayvoron, Putyvl, and Belgorod. On 14 February 1925, it was abolished.

Holmblad was also part of the circle around Carl Frederik Tietgen, co-founding several of his companies. Holmblad is associated with Amager, Copenhagen, where Holmbladsgade is named after him. Family background Holmblad's grandfather, Laudidz Holmblad, painted by Christian Albrecht Jensen in 1827 L. P. Holmblad was born into a family of industrialists on 8 July 1815. His great-grandfather, Jacob Holmblad, a Swedish dyer who emigrated to Denmark in about 1766, introduced new production methods at the Royal Textile Factory where he used Rubia plants to produce the red dye for the Royal Life Guards' gala uniforms. In 1777 he obtained a royal privilege to set up his own dye factory. It was situated in Sølvgade (No. 38, now Holmblad House) but later moved to the corner of Gothersgade and Regnegade. The enterprise was later taken over by his son, Lauridz Holmblad, who also founded a soap factory in 1805 and started Denmark's first real production of paint in 1819. L. P. Holmblad's father Jacob Holmblad inherited the soap factory in 1827 while his uncle Carl Frederik Holmblad took over the paint factory, the later Sadolin & Holmblad. Jacob Holmblad's soap factory on the corner of Gothersgade and Regnegade also comprised productions of both lacquer and playing cards. His activities also comprised a glue factory and a marrow oil factory in Amager. L. P. Holmblad L. P. Holmblad's Factory in Gothersgade L. P. Holmblad's oil mill and candle manufactory, built 1842-46. Painted by F.C. Kiærskou in 1851 Holmblad's glue factory painted by the same artist After his father's death in 1837, L. P. Holmblad took over the management of the companies on behalf of his mother. In 1841, he established a production of whale oil. After his mother ceded the companies to him in 1842, he also founded a candle factory, which was the first in Denmark to use stearin in the manufacture of candles. It was a great success and had to be expanded in 1847. In 1880, L. P. Holmblad moved their production of stearin candles to Blegdamsvej, where they had acquired O.F. Asp's candle factory which was expanded by Hans Jørgen Holm. Holmblad also built a new factory in Amager in 1880. Other business engagements In 1862, Holmblad was elected for Privatbanken's bank council, where he until his death remained a loyal supporter of Carl Frederik Tietgen. He took an active part in the industrial and commercial heyday that took place under Tietgen's leadership after 1864. In 1866 he co-founded Det Forenede Dampskibs-Selskab, where he was also a board member from 1870. He was also a co-founder of Burmeister & Wain (1872), Em. Z. Svitzers Bjergnings-Entreprise and Great Northern Telephone Company (1870). He also became a board member of the Danish Sugar Factories in 1874. Holmblad was also involved in companies that were not associated with Tietgen. He was vice chairman of De private Assurandeurer from 1883 and from 1886 its chairman. In 1886, he became a board member of Nye danske Brandforsikringsselskab. Philanthropy Holmblad was an active philanthropist. In 1857 he became curator of Vajsenhuset and in 1870 one of its three directors. From 1876 he was chairman of the association behind the construction of Kunstnerhjemmet which provided affordable housing and studio facilities for artists. In Amager, where most of his companies were gradually concentrated, he was a great supporter of the poor as well as the construction of both schools and churches. Legacy Bust of Holmblad in one of the courtyards of Amager Hospital in Copenhagen After L. P. Holmblad's death, his company continued to exist under the leadership of first his son and then his grandson until 1919, when it was merged into O.F. Asp under the name ASP- Holmblad. It was part of a larger merger, Medicinalco, which also included three other companies: Gustav Lotze, Th. Lose & Co. and A. Appelts. The street Holmbladsgade is named after Lauritz Peter Holmblad. Several buildings associated with him still exist today. Holmbladsgade Cultural Centre is based in one of his old buildings, a warehouse from 1880. It was adapted for its current use by Dorte Mandrup in 2001. His oil mill, built the same year, is located next to it. His former candle factory on Blegdamsvej is located at No. 104. The expansion (1880) was designed by Hans Jørgen Holm (windows have been changed). His villa on Holmbladsgade was acquired by Nathanael's Church and adapted for use as a parish house in 1988. His country house Skovbakken is in Skodsborg, north of Copenhagen (Strandvej 253). The house was designed by Ferdinand Meldahl in the style of a \\"Norwegian cottage\\" and built in 1859.

She was named for Francis Marion, an American Revolutionary War general who was known for his unconventional warfare tactics. Marion served during the Rum Patrol and World War II performing defense, law enforcement, ice patrol, and search and rescue missions. Most notably, Marion served as the platform for the first intensive oceanographic studies made by the Coast Guard.Johnson, pp 117–118 Construction and commissioning Marion was built by American Brown Boveri Electric Corporation at Camden, New Jersey. She was commissioned as USCGC Marion (WSC-145) on 6 April 1927. She was the eleventh of the Active-class patrol boats to be commissioned, which were designed for trailing the \\"mother ships\\" that supported the smuggling boats of \\"rum-runners\\" during Prohibition. The Active-class ships were also referred to unofficially as the \\"Buck & a Quarter\\" class in reference to their 125-foot length.Scheina (1990), pp 57–60Johnson, p 88 Marion expedition to Davis Strait Marion was initially assigned Rum Patrol duties with a home-port of New London, Connecticut, however, Lieutenant Commander Edward H. Smith had been directed by Coast Guard Commandant Frederick C. Billard to outfit her as an oceanographic research vessel for an expedition to Arctic waters off the coast of Greenland. The purpose of the expedition was to attempt to find information about the formation of icebergs and their movements. Marion was loaded with supplies and provisions for 70 days of cruising and spare parts for every piece of machinery on board. The complement was increased to two officers, two warrant officers and 23 men; six more than her normal complement. Marion departed Boston, Massachusetts, on 11 July 1928,Record of Movements, Vessels of the United States Coast Guard, 1790–December 31, 1933\\", U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Transportation, p 426 stopped briefly at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and arrived at Sydney, Nova Scotia, where fuel and water supplies were topped off and 78 drums of fuel were stowed on deck. While at both Halifax and Sydney, Smith consulted local mariners familiar with the Labrador Sea and Davis Strait and updated the ship's charts with information from the mariner's charts.Johnson, p 118 Departing Sydney on 16 July using only one engine to conserve fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic survey mission. Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had the knowledge of how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.Johnson, p 120 After four days sailing a gale forced Marion to seek shelter at Godhavn where the crew was granted liberty. To Smith's surprise diesel fuel was available and he took the opportunity to fill the ship's fuel tanks. With the unexpected acquisition of fuel, when Marion departed Godhavn, she was able to do so on both engines. After completing a line of sample stations to the north, she returned to top off fuel and water tanks before heading across to Baffin Bay, all the while taking soundings and samples. Samples were taken along the coast of Baffin Island and a line across Davis Strait during the month of August ending at Ivigtut, the site of a cryolite mine that was Greenland's main source of income during that period. After re-provisioning and fueling, she headed back to sea only to be forced to shelter under Mount Kungmat for three days before departing Cape Farewell on a station line to Belle Isle. A storm prevented entering the Strait of Belle Isle so Smith decided to put in at St. John's, Newfoundland, for a liberty and supplies. While en route, Smith managed to run two unscheduled station lines along the Newfoundland coastal shelf.Johnson, pp 120–121 Marion arrived at St. John's on 11 September and departed for New London the next day, her scientific mission accomplished. She arrived at New London on 19 September 1928 after having traveled and taken observations at 191 oceanographic stations with some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity. Numerous bottom samples had been taken and soundings were added to the charts of the area.Johnson, p 122 The Marion expedition observations demonstrated that pack ice had a direct influence on the drift of icebergs. Heavy pack ice along the Newfoundland and Labrador shelf waters prevented icebergs from being carried to shore and forced them to enter shipping lanes to the south. Little ice on the shelves allowed the icebergs to ground on the Newfoundland coast, where they were harmless. The expedition was the beginning of a long involvement by the Coast Guard in Greenland and its surrounding waters. Patrol duties during the Depression Since Marion had originally been designed specifically for prohibition enforcement service, after the specialized oceanographic equipment was removed she resumed Rum Patrol duty with a home-port of New London. Her routine consisted of picketing liquor laden \\"mother ships\\" and preventing them from offloading prohibited cargo to smaller contact boats that were used to deliver liquor to shore.Johnson, p 80 In 1933, Marion was assigned the home-port of Norfolk, Virginia. With the end of prohibition, she assumed a more traditional role of a Coast Guard cutter, that of search and rescue, law enforcement, merchant vessel inspection, and defense training.Canney, p xiii Marion was transferred later to patrol duties out of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. On 1 November 1940 she was transferred to U.S. Navy control out of Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands, where she performed wartime patrols and convoy escort duty. World War II service Marion served on anti-submarine patrols with the Navy's Caribbean Sea Frontier Squadron based at Charlotte Amalie during World War II. On 14 October 1943, off Mayaguez, Puerto Rico, she assisted with the evacuation of the crew of EM Dow which had been badly damaged by squalls on a passage from Baltimore, Maryland. Marion made a lee for the stricken ship and rescued all 37 crewmembers of Dow without loss of life. Post-war service Marion was released from Navy service on 1 January 1946 and was reassigned duties out of Norfolk consisting of law enforcement and search and rescue work. In June 1955, she towed Siboney to safety from east of Norfolk.Scheina (1990), p 60 Marion was decommissioned on 15 February 1962 and sold 8 March 1963 to Robert F. Solomon of Norfolk who renamed her Top Cat. See also Rum Patrol Notes Citations References  * Websites External links * The Journal of Ensign W. E.

This poem is part of a larger work entitled Songs of Innocence which was published in the year 1789. \\"The Little Boy Lost\\" is a prelude to \\"The Little Boy Found\\".  Summary  \\"The Little Boy Lost\\" begins with a boy walking behind his father and asking the father to slow his pace so he does not get lost. In the illustration that accompanies the poem, the child is actually following a dim light (referred to in the poem as a vapour). Night comes and the little boy is lost walking in soggy ground,covered in mud, and weeping as the vapour flies away from him.  Interpretation  Upon the publication of \\"The Little Boy Lost\\" and Songs of Innocence, people of Blake's time perceived the compilation of poems as a children's book because it was easy to read, the poems were very short, meant to be sung, and were accompanied by colourful illustrations. In modern times, however, much deeper understanding of the poem has developed. One can not analyse a poem by William Blake without noting its themes that come from the Christian faith. Some interpret the poem as representing the relationship between humans and our spiritual lives with the Biblical God. The father represents earthly pleasures that we might end up following. A person can become lost in a spiritual journey by acting on impulse; following drugs, a lavish lifestyle, or anything else that goes against Biblical principles.\\"The Little Boy Lost and The Little Boy Found.\\" University of Buckingham. N.p., n.d. Web. 04 Dec. 2013. Like the little boy covered in mud, adults who have followed the wrong \\"god\\" to a life of sin are covered in that sin and completely lost.\\"Summary and Analysis of The Little Boy Lost by William Blake.\\" Beaming Notes. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Dec. 2013  Literary devices  \\"The Little Boy Lost\\" is a two stanza poem with eight total lines. It is written in ballad metre (essentially a loose common metre). In the poem Blake uses internal rhyme in line 7 \\"The mire was deep, & the child did weep\\" with the words \\"weep\\" and \\"deep\\". This played a role in the simplicity of reading the poem. The use of caesuras throughout the poem also contributes to the easy reading, giving the reader a chance to slowly read and take in the words and meanings. The repetition words, such as \\"Father\\", put an emphasis on the meaning of Father in the piece. The title \\"Father\\" serves the use of ambiguity, because one may interpret different meaning from the word. The poem itself is ambiguous, because it has its literal meaning and religious meaning. Blake incorporated symbolism in line 9 \\"And away the vapour flew\\", \\"vapour\\" symbolise the \\"Father\\" from the beginning of the poem.

The fiber architecture of three- dimensional braided fabrics provides high strength, stiffness, and structural integrity, making them suitable for a wide array of applications. 3D fabrics can be produced via weaving, knitting, and non-weaving processes.  History  Three-dimensional braiding is among the oldest and most important of textile processes, transforming small natural fibers into more functional forms. Fabrics used in 3D braiding, such as rope, have been used since 4,000 BC. In 1748, patents for the first 3D braiding machines were initiated in England. Most 3D braiding machines of the time were developed by modifying 2D braiding machines. In 1767, the first braiding machines which produced two- dimensional fabrics whose properties were different from 3D fabrics appeared in Germany. During the 1960s, the U.S. Government, as well as industrial and academic researchers, developed 3D braiding machines for use in producing composite material preforms, such as carbon fiber composites.Branscomb, David, David Beale, and Royall Broughton(2013). \\"New Directions in Braiding.\\" The Journal of Engineered Fibers and Fabrics (JEFF) 8.2: 1-24.  Properties 3D braids show improved mechanical and structural properties. An important characteristic of 3D braids is their ability to form a variety of complex shapes; the direct manufacturing of complex structural shapes helps to eliminate the process of cutting to form joints, overlaps, and splices. 3D braided fabrics have high torsional stability and structural integrity.Du, G.-W., and F. K. Ko(1993). \\"Unit Cell Geometry of 3D Braided Structures.\\" Journal of Reinforced Plastics and Composites 12.7: 752-68.  Manufacturing Techniques  A track plate is kept at the bottom of the machine. Packages, which supply axial yarns, are kept beneath the track plate. Bobbins are mounted on the carrier, which is pushed by horn gears over the track plate. Braiding yarns are fed from these bobbins. The relative motion of the braiding yarns and the axial yarn determines the pattern and the structure of the braid. The 3D braiding process is a minor modification of 2D braiding process, where the standing ends are added to the braiding yarns that are moving. The most important 3D braiding techniques are discussed below.  Circular braiding and over-braiding  In circular braiding, the bobbins (with opposite directions of rotation) move in two concentric orbits. The two orbits interfere to form dephased sinusoidal oscillations that determine the thread's pattern and crossing point. At this crossing point, the bobbins change their path to produce the upper and inner side of the braid. Generally, the circular braiding process produces braids with rotational symmetry. The over-braiding process follows the same principle as the circular braiding process, but the only modification is that the crossing point is located at the center.  Four-step braiding process  In this process, the bobbins move on the X and Y axes, which are mutually perpendicular to each other. In each step, the bobbins move to the neighboring crossing point in both axis and both directions, and stop for a specific interval of time. Basic arrangement of the braiding field is obtained after a minimum of four steps. This method produces braids which have a constant cross section.  Two-step braiding process  In the two-step braiding process, the bobbins move continuously without stopping. They move on the track plate through the complete structure and around the standing ends, such that the movements of bobbins are faster when compared to the four-step braiding process. The bobbins can move only in two directions, so the process is called the two-step braiding process.  3D rotary braiding  The 3D rotary braiding process consists of base plates with horn gears and mobile bobbins arranged upon them. Switches are used to control the position of the threads and horn gears.  Applications of 3D braided fabrics  3D braided fabrics have found applications in areas including medicine, aerospace, automobiles, train components, and reinforced hoses.Drechsler.K (1999). \\"3-D Textile Reinforced Composites for the Transportation Industry.\\" 3-D Textile Reinforcements in Composite Materials. 43-66. The initial development of 3D braided fabrics came from the composite and medical industries. 3D braided fabrics can be manufactured in myriad varieties of cross-sections, and their near-net complex shapes made it possible to design very specialized products for both industries.Tong, Liyong, Adrian P. Mouritz, and Michael K. Bannister (2002). 3D Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites.137-146. In helicopters, typical structural components like beams, sandwich structures, frames, and panels are manufactured using 3D braided profiles. Similarly, 3D fabrics are used to manufacture complex beam structures and floor panels in passenger cars. For train structures, different components manufactured from 3D braided profiles include the roof panel, interior components, side panels, and body structures.  In Medicine  In the medical industry, 3D braided fabrics find applications in stent grafts, bifurcated stents, arm and leg prosthetics, and braided sutures. Surgeons initially used two separate implant procedures for bifurcation stenosis treatment, which was time-consuming. With the advent of 3D braided fabric, multiple dendrite circular braids were produced for bifurcation stenosis treatment, which is flexible and less time-consuming. With multiple tubular braided structures, various cardiovascular implants can be produced.Schreiber, F., F. K. Ko, H. J. Yang, E. Amalric, and T. Gries (2009). Proc. of 17th International Conference on Composite Materials, UK, Edinburg.  In manufacturing of reinforced composite  Braiding is a unique technology for producing high-volume, yet low-cost, composites.Branscomb, David, David Beale, and Royall Broughton. (2013). (\\"New Directions in Braiding\\") (\\"Journal of Engineered Fibers and Fabrics 8.2.\\") With 3D braided fabric as reinforcement, complex shapes can be manufactured inexpensively. The 3D braided reinforced composites also exhibit high delamination resistance.Mouritz, A.p., M.k. Bannister, P.j. Falzon, and K.h. Leong(1999).

These towers were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milefortlet, and would probably have been manned by part of the nearest Milefortlet's garrison. The towers associated with Milefortlet 4 are known as Tower 4A () and Tower 4B (). The position of Tower 4A is uncertain, although it thought to lie on the crest of a ridge with good views seaward. Tower 4B is located in a field west of Cardurnock. It was excavated by in 1977, which located three sides of the tower surviving as robber trenches: the western side having been completely eroded. The tower was interpreted as having had three phases: in the first two phases palisade structures were built, but in the third phase these were abandoned and a stone tower was built.

Phase 2 dated to the Antonine era, when the size of the milefortlet was reduced. Phase 3 seems to date from the 4th century. In Phase 3 the ramparts were retained but they were refaced on the south, west and north sides, and it seems a stone building in the fortlet was built during this period.

Weatherhogg (1872 - 1937) was an American architect from Fort Wayne, Indiana.C. R. WEATHERHOGG DIED SUDDENLY (Obituary) The News-Journal, October 18, 1937 (North Manchester Historical Society) He was born in Donington, England and attended the Art Institute of Lincoln in Lincolnshire. He worked for an architect in Lincolnshire before coming to the United States to see the 1893 World's Fair, lived in Chicago for a year, and settled in Fort Wayne in 1892. He settled in Fort Wayne, working briefly with the firm of Wing & Mahurin, before he opened an office with Alfred Grindle, himself a fellow Wing and Mahurin employee. Grindle and Weatherhogg maintained a partnership from about 1893-1897. They had a branch office in Muncie and designed a number of large homes in that city. Their most important project together was the Jasper County Courthouse, 1897, also in Rensselaer. Grindle first received the commission for the Jasper County Courthouse, then brought in Weatherhogg. Grindle left the project entirely to Weatherhogg, who then completed most of the design work. The courthouse is an imposing three story limestone building with tower executed in the Chateauesque/Tudor Revival style. Weatherhogg went on to design a number of buildings in Fort Wayne, including several schools, the Masonic Temple, Blackstone Building, Fairfield Apartments, and the People's Trust and Savings Bank. Although adept at many styles, Weatherhogg often used a variant of classicism in his works Rensselaer Carnegie Library, 94000233; National Register of Historic Places Inventory – Nomination Form; US Dept of the Interior, National Park Service; Washington, D.C.; March 1994 Weatherhogg had a brief partnership with Alfred Grindle until Grindle moved to Muncie.

The Antisemitic Exhibition in Zagreb took place in the Art Pavilion in Zagreb, the capital city of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH), in May 1942. History According to its organizers, the exhibition sought to expose the \\"destructive and exploitative work of Croatia's Jews prior to 1941.\\" Its promotional brochure, produced by Ustaše authorities from the State Investigative and Propaganda Bureau of the NDH (Državni izvještajni i promičbeni ured or DIPU), claimed that most of the displays had been created by \\"racial experts, demographers, scientists, and ordinary citizens as well as the bureau's investigators.\\" These brochures featured supposed scientific illustrations depicting the alleged Jewish \\"colonization\\" of Croatia and the population growth rate of the Jewish community in the country. The brochures also purported that Jews \\"dominated Croatian commerce in comparison to their share of the population.\\" Although the figures presented lacked serious credibility, the authors reiterated that \\"rigorous science [was] behind their analysis.\\" The racist promotional poster used to promote the exhibition featured a nude Aryan warrior fighting a large serpent adorned with Jewish symbols as he carried a sword and shield depicting the Croatian coat of arms. The image sought to portray \\"the new Ustaša man ... purifying Croatia's body politic of the racially degenerate Jews.\\" The organizers of the exhibition also sought to expose the supposed \\"economic injustices\\" and \\"abuse\\" suffered by \\"honest Croatian workers\\" at the hands of Jews in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The exhibition also claimed that Croatian women and girls were being sexually mistreated by Jews. Its promotional film went so far as to suggest that \\"Jewish pimps [had] picked up vulnerable Croatian women, seducing them and selling them into a sordid life of brothels, prostitution, and white slavery.\\" The exhibition opened on 1 May 1942. According to Zagreb newspaper Nova Hrvatska report, various state officials attended the opening, including NDH interior minister Andrija Artuković and representatives of the German, Italian and Slovak embassies in Zagreb, as well as the then mayor of Zagreb Ivan Werner. Head of the DIPU Vilko Rieger opened the exhibition with a speech in which he described Jews as detrimental to \\"the customs and society of Aryan peoples\\" by being \\"at the forefront of both exploitative capitalism and marxism\\" and that history has showed that \\"healthy nations always fought the Jewish danger\\". According to the same newspaper's report on 5 May, the exhibition was seen by 8,000 visitors in the first four days. In addition, all visitors received free tickets for cinema screenings of German antisemitic propaganda films Jew Süss, The Rothschilds and The Eternal Jew. Antisemitic caricature at the exhibition One of the exhibition authors hired by DIPU was a comic book artist Walter Neugebauer who also appears in an 11-minute documentary film commissioned by DIPU titled How Exhibitions are Created (Kako se stvaraju izložbe) which purports to document the pseudo-scientific and creative efforts in putting together the exhibition. In the film, itself described as \\"one of the darkest chapters in the history of Croatian cinema\\", Neugebauer is shown drawing a caricature of a \\"typical Jew\\". The exhibition featured displays with text panels showing translated quotes from the Talmud, illustrated art caricatures of Jews, a sculpture of a stereotypical \\"Jewish\\" head and maps chronicling Jewish expansion in Croatia and neighbouring countries. The exhibition also featured photographs of the various stages of the demolition of the Zagreb Synagogue (which had been located in the city centre and was destroyed in stages from October 1941 to April 1942). The exhibition was open to public until 1 June 1942. Afterwards, its displays were exhibited to audiences in Karlovac, Dubrovnik and Sarajevo (6–20 September 1942). Historian Ivo Goldstein and author Rory Yeomans have described it as being the pinnacle of the propaganda campaign spread by the Ustaše against Croatia's Jewish community during World War II.

After being unsuccessful for Grenville in 1862, in August 1863 he was returned for Mandurang in the Liberal interest, and continued to sit for that constituency until February 1880. In September 1865 he was called to the Victorian bar, and practised with success, being from time to time Crown Prosecutor. From July 1868 to September 1869 he was Minister of Justice in the second James McCulloch Administration, exchanging this office for that of Solicitor-General about a fortnight before the defeat of the Government. The next year Casey was appointed Chairman of a Royal Commission on Intercolonial Legislation and a Court of Appeal. In June 1872 he became Minister of Lands and Minister of Agriculture under James Francis, and held office till August 1875—for the last twelve months of the time under George Kerferd, who succeeded Francis as Premier. Whilst at the head of the Lands Office Casey reorganised the department, and constituted the survey branch on an effective basis. He also checked the system of \\"dummyism\\" by instituting inquiries, and subsequently forfeiting the runs and improvements of the incriminated squatters. He was president of the St Kilda Football Club from 1873 to 1879. In 1878 he was appointed Executive Commissioner for Victoria at the Paris Exhibition, and was created C.M.G. for his services, being also nominated an Officer of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. The Victorian Hansard was established on his motion, and, when in office, he introduced the system of appointing magistrates to districts instead of for the whole colony. The jurisdiction of the County Courts was, on his initiation, increased from £50 to £250 at common law, and an equitable jurisdiction was conferred on them up to £500. Though still claiming to be a Liberal, Casey assumed an independent attitude towards the second Graham Berry Ministry from 1877 to 1880, and was in consequence ejected from his seat at Mandurang at the general election in the latter year. Casey did not re-enter parliament, though he unsuccessfully contested Sandridge (now Port Melbourne) in 1883. Casey, who was the first President of the Federal Bank of Australia, was Executive Vice-President of the Melbourne International Exhibition (1880), and in that capacity, and as Chairman of the Great Britain Committee, contributed much to its success. In April 1884 Casey, who is the author of \\"Casey's Justices' Manual,\\" was appointed a County Court Judge; and in July 1885 he assumed the additional functions of a Land Tax Commissioner, being for a short time in that year an Acting Judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. Casey married Maria Teresa, daughter of John Cahill and Mary McNamara his wife, of Bendigo; there were no children. Casey died in St Kilda, Melbourne, Australia, on 5 April 1913.

Two of the best known, Theodore of Amasea and Theodore Stratelates, were probably the same person. A variety of stories are told about Theodore the Martyr. Relics of Theodore the Martyr, including at least four bodies as well as body parts, were taken to Venice, where he is one of the patron saints, or to other places in Western Europe. Identification Theodore is a Greek name, Θεόδωρος (Theodōros), meaning \\"God's gift\\" (from the Greek words Θεός, (theos) \\"God\\" and δώρον (dōron) \\"gift\\"). A number of Christian Saints named Theodore were martyred. Perhaps the earliest recorded is Theodore, of Theodore and Pausilippus, martyrs who died around 130 AB in Byzantium, and who have a feast day on 9 April. The best known saint called Theodore the Martyr is probably Theodore of Amasea, also called Theodore Tyro. The suffix Tiro means \\"recruit\\". Stories include a miracle where Theodore Tyro rescued a child who had been sold to the Ishmaelites as a slave, and an occasion when he rescued his mother from the jaws of a dragon. He refused to take part in a pagan ceremony, and then set fire to the temple of Cybele, near Amasya in Pontus. He was burned to death in a furnace as punishment. His sanctuary was established at Euchaita. Theodore of Amasea was almost certainly the same person as Theodore Stratelates. Theodore Stratelates, also called Theodore of Heraclea, was a Roman general in the army of the Emperor Licinius (r. 308–324). He was either beheaded or crucified at the command of the emperor. Theodore Stratelates is an important saint in the Greek Orthodox Church. Accounts Saints Theodore Tyron and Theodore Stratelates in a fresco from Rila Monastery, Bulgaria According to the Book of the Saints of the Ethiopian Church, Saint Theodore the Martyr was a captain of the soldiers of the city of Setb, in the province of Asyut in Upper Egypt. A church was dedicated to him, and great signs and wonders took place through his body. Abu al-Makarim, writing in 1348, says there was a church named after him in Babylon, Egypt. Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335 – c. 395) gave an Oration on Theodore the Martyr in Amasya in 383, in the church where the saint's remains were said to be located. This Theodore was a Roman soldier martyred around 303 in the time of the Emperor Maximian (c. 250 – 310). He was among a surge of soldiers who were martyred in the 4th century. He is described as \\"a poor soldier, newly conscripted.\\" Gregory said, \\"This, as we believe, is he who during the past year calmed the stormy fury of the barbarians, and stopped the terrible war of the savage Scythians\\". He called on Theodore for assistance, saying \\"gather together the troops of thy brother martyrs, and thou with them beseech God to stay the invasion of the barbarians.\\" Gregory wrote, \\"The hues of the ornamentation in the church are veritably like a book that speaks, for painting even if silent knows how to speak from the wall.\\" This speech is often used in defense of the use of religious images. The Emperor John I Tzimiskes fought a successful battle against the Russians in 970 in which the whole Greek army saw a champion on a white horse fighting before the first ranks. He disappeared after the battle was won. The Russian prince Sviatoslav I of Kiev was forced to abandon Bulgaria and retreat to Russia. The victory occurred on the anniversary of Saint Theodore the Martyr, and the army thought that the knight on the white horse was the saint. The emperor repaired the church of Theodore in Euchaneia, and changed the name of that city to Theodoropolis. Saint Theodore was the patron saint of the Capuchins. An observer in Rome in 1844 of a Capuchin's panegyric of Saint Theodore at the church dedicated to the martyr, on the saint's day, recorded as a sample, Relics Italy Statue of St Theodore on western column in Piazzetta in Venice In 1100 the remains of Saint Theodore the Martyr were stolen from Myra in Asia Minor and taken to Venice, along with the body of Saint Nicholas of Myra and his uncle, also Nicholas. This occurred during an expedition to the Holy Land of about 200 ships dispatched by the Doge Vitale Michiel of Venice under the spiritual leadership of Enrico Contarini, the Bishop of Olivolo. Theodore the Martyr became one of the four tutelary guardians of Venice, along with the angel Gabriel, the Virgin Mary and Saint Mark the Evangelist. However, Saint Theodore was often used as a symbol of Venice's affiliation to Byzantium and as Venice became more independent, Saint Theodore's presence waned in the city. In 1257 Jacopo Dauro raided Mesembria on the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, and took the headless body of Saint Theodore the Martyr from its church of Saint Sophia. The saint was headless because the Emperor Licinius had decapitated him after he had slain a dragon. A relative of Jacopo, Marco Dauro, took the body to Venice where he placed it in the church of San Salvador. Saint Theodore and the dragon were later commemorated in a statue on top of his column in Venice. The Irish friar Simon Fitz-Simon passed through Venice in 1323 on his way to the Holy Land, and listed Theodore the Martyr among the bodies of saints that lay in the city, \\"whole and uncorrupted\\". The Jesuit Richa in his History of the Churches of Florence recorded that at the Convent of our Lady of the Murate there was a rib of St. Theodore the Martyr, which had been mislaid and forgotten, but which the saint revealed in a vision to Sister Maria of Scarperia. The chronicle of the convent included many wonderful events associated with this relic. An 1872 account tells of a small church of Theodore the Martyr at the foot of Palatine Hill in Rome. Mothers would bring their children to the church to kiss the saint's relic. Elsewhere Glastonbury Abbey once held relics of Theodore At Thorney, Cambridgeshire, England, a new church was built by Abbott Gunther in 1069. In 1105 relics of Theodore the Martyr were translated to the church. John of Glastonbury's Cronica sive Antiquitates Glastoniensis Ecclesie, written in the mid-14th century, recorded that Glastonbury Abbey had relics of Theodore the Martyr. During the Fourth Crusade (1202–1204) the German monk Gunther of Pairis obtained a variety of relics, including a trace of the blood of Jesus. The collection included a piece of the True Cross, a piece of Saint John the Baptist and the arm of Saint James the Great. There were relics of other saints including Theodore the Martyr. The Clairvaux inventory of 1504 included a number of relics including the shoulder blade of Saint Theodore the Martyr. The Dames de l'Assomption of rue Saint-Honoré in Paris, who rebuilt their church in 1670 at their own expense, preserved the body of Saint Theodore the Martyr with great veneration. It had been given to them by Cardinal Antonio Barberini, the Archbishop of Rheims. Philip II of Spain (1527–1598) was a great collector of relics, and accumulated a huge collection. It included 290 teeth of Saint Apollonia, the patron saint of toothache. His successors continued to add to the collection. In 1762 it was reported that the body of Saint Theodore the Martyr was lying in a magnificent shrine of silver or brass gilt, adorned with crystals and gems and enameled with gold, in the monastery of El Escorial near Madrid, Spain.

These milefortlets and intervening stone watchtowers extended from the western end of Hadrian's Wall, along the Cumbrian coast and were linked by a wooden palisade. They were contemporary with defensive structures on Hadrian's Wall. The exact location of Milefortlet 2 is unknown, although one of the nearby turrets (Tower 2B) has been located and excavated. Description Milefortlet 2 was situated somewhere on the coast near Scargavel Point in the civil parish of Bowness. The milefortlet has never been located, but its position has been estimated from the known positions of Milefortlet 1 and Milefortlet 3. The likeliest position for the fort is under the buildings of North Plain farm () which stands on a slight ridge with good views to the sea. An alternative location is out on the salt marsh ().  Associated Towers  Each milefortlet had two associated towers, similar in construction to the turrets built along Hadrian's Wall. These towers were positioned approximately one-third and two- thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milefortlet, and would probably have been manned by part of the nearest Milefortlet's garrison. The towers associated with Milefortlet 2 are known as Tower 2A () and Tower 2B (). The site of Tower 2A is uncertain, and it has never been located. The site of Tower 2B has been located and it is clearly visible on aerial photographs. Tower 2B was excavated by in 1993, and initial investigations indicated that there had been two timber phases followed by rebuilding in stone. Since then, the evidence for the timber phases has been dismissed, and the stone tower is the only phase which has been confirmed.

The third part of the song contains the lyrics of Umi Yukaba. Three years after its composition, Setoguchi made an instrumental arrangement of the song for the Imperial Japanese Navy Band where he served as its bandleader. The march was subsequently adopted as the Imperial Japanese Navy's official march. The Warship March was performed in Europe during the Imperial Japanese Navy Band's tour of Europe in 1907.

This is especially prevalent in styles used in Revival architecture. Through combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, Neo- Historism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus, it offers a great variety of possible designs. New Classical architecture is a subtrend of Neo-Historicism.  Evolution  In the history of art, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked not only by a reinterpretation of classicism but also of the stylistic eras that succeeded it: Neoclassicism and then Romanticism, itself considered a historicist movement. In architecture and history painting, which increasingly painted historical subjects with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the bourgeoisie during and after the Industrial Revolution. By the fin de siècle, Symbolism and Art Nouveau, followed by Expressionism and Modernism, acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The Arts and Crafts movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles in the realm of the architecture. Influences of historicism remained strong even until the 1950s in many countries, especially for representative and prestige buildings (see Socialist Classicism for example). When Postmodern architecture became widely popular in the 1980s, a return to classical architecture language was combined with contemporary elements. Modernist architecture (also called Neomodern) became more dominant in the early 2000s again, joined by short-period fashionable styles like Deconstructivism and Blobitecture. In contrast to this, traditionalist tendencies arose again and remain developing until today.

It belongs to the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of the Amaryllis family (Amaryllidaceae).  Description  Terrestrial bulbous perennial herbaceous plants, although three species of Hippeastrum are epiphytic. The leaf shape is linear, lorate, or lanceolate (Eithea has oblanceolate-petioled leaves). The leaf growth pattern is annual or persistent, and often histeranthous. Their texture is firm, and they are moderately canaliculated internally. The scape is hollow and the spathe has two bracts which may be fused or free. The inflorescence may have between one and thirteen flowers. The flowers, which may be sessile or pedicellate have a perigone that is actinomorphic to highly zygomorphic, and is tubular, campanulate or infundibulorm in shape. The tepal- tube may vary from obsolete to being more than half the length of the perigone. When a paraperigone is present it consists of basal appendages that are diminutive, membranous, bristle-like, and forming a fimbriate-lacerate or callose ring, partly adnate to the throat of the perigone, surrounding the fascicle of the stamen. thumbHippeastrum: Trifid stigma The stamen filaments are filiform and either declinate-ascending or straight and arranged in two to four series (2- or 4-seriate). The stigma is usually either trifid or obscurely trilobed, but some taxa (Famatina herbertiana, Tocantinia mira, and certain Hippeastrum species) have a capitate stigma. The style is either declinate or straight. Chromosome number: 2n = 12–60.  Taxonomy  As formulated on morphological grounds alone it included six genera: This included species of medium height and often with many flowers in each inflorescence and inflorescence bracts are different in size and fused basally. The alternative spelling Hippeastrineae was also used by some authors. As reformulated using molecular phylogenetics it included seven to eight genera (Famatina is uncertain). In this redistribution the four species of Famatina were polyphyletic and F. maulensis segregated with Phycella and was consequently placed in Traubiinae, while the remaining three segregated with Rhodophiala and are considered here. However none of the identified genera were monophyletic. Some subclades were supported, such as the core- Rhodophiala (Rhodophiala excluding R. bifida but including some Famatina). The genera and (species) are as follows: * Eithea (1) * Famatina s.s. * Habranthus (86) * Hippeastrum (114) * Rhodophiala (27) * Sprekelia (2) * Tocantinia (1) * Zephyranthes (107) Formerly included, now subtribe Traubiinae: * Placea * Phycella (includes Famatina maulensis) * Traubia  Distribution  Mainly subtropical and tropical regions of South America, the Greater Antilles, Mexico, and the southern United States. Core-Rhodophiala species are distributed in Mediterranean Chile, including the lowlands and high-Andes as well as high Andean areas of Argentina, and also the Atacama Desert.

The work criticizes homeopathy, which he considered to be akin to \\"astrology, palmistry and other methods of getting a living out of the weakness and credulity of mankind and womankind\\". It is considered to be a classic text, one of Holmes' most important works, as well as one of the earliest criticisms of homeopathy. Synopsis Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions is composed of two parts. In the first, Holmes explains how the placebo effect can produce false positives, and describes numerous forms of popular but ineffective quackery (including the royal touch, the tractors of Elisha Perkins, and the powder of sympathy), to demonstrate that positive anecdotal evidence is not necessarily indicative of an effective medical therapy. He also describes how Perkins claimed the healing powers of the tractors were due to their being made of a special alloy, but how they declined in popularity after it was discovered that the tractors had the same effect no matter what they were made of. In the second, he criticizes the basis of homeopathy itself, such as its theory of dilutions. Another issue is that of homeopathic provings (the practice of taking a substance to see what symptoms it causes). Holmes claims that during provings, subjects consider even the slightest discomfort (such as itching) to be the result of the substance, and that this method does not demonstrate symptom causality. In the work Holmes also expressed a belief that \\"real advances were made only after years of work by highly trained men who cared little for fame and money\\". Reception Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions received both praise and criticism after its release. In a series of letters titled Some Remarks on Dr. O. W. Holmes's Lectures on Homeopathy and Its Kindred Delusions; Communicated to a Friend, Robert Wesselhoeft negatively compared Holmes' work to writers that \\"made sport of their fellow man\\" and considered the work to be representative of \\"Old School medicine's continued scorn for reform\\". In contrast, Eric W. Boyle wrote in his 2013 book Quack Medicine that Holmes' work was \\"the most thoroughly explicated attack on homeopathy as a dangerous and deadly error\\".

He currently manages Kinda Funny, a YouTube channel along with Nick Scarpino and Tim Gettys. Miller was a frequent cast member and host on the IGN audio-video podcasts Game Scoop! and Podcast Beyond.. He and fellow former-IGN editors Colin Moriarty, Nick Scarpino, and Tim Gettys left IGN on January 5, 2015 to found Kinda Funny.  Awards  In March 2016 Miller won the South by South West (SXSW) \\"Most Entertaining Online Personality\\" award. In December 2015 he won an award at The Game Awards in the category Trending Gamer. Personal life In 2001, Miller moved to Columbia, Missouri and attended the University of Missouri, where he gained a degree in magazine journalism. He was later employed at the Columbia Tribune, where he created the \\"Game Over\\" column in 2006. As of 2009, the column is now defunct. At Missouri, Miller was a member of The Antlers (University of Missouri), and served as the Grand Poobah of the group for the 2003-2004 school year. In August 2012, Greg announced he had Hodgkin’s lymphoma,https://web.archive.org/web/20120812022546/http://www.ign.com/blogs/greggy- ign/2012/08/09/so-i-have-cancer-who-wants-to-cook-meth/ a form of cancer, but after chemotherapy, he announced in December 2012 that his cancer was in remission. Greg Miller had lost an estimated 20 pounds as of September 19, 2014, reportedly caused by his change in diet. On May 1, 2017, Miller married Canadian Geneviève St-Onge. St-Onge also works in the video game industry as co-founder of Popagenda, a video game centred public relations and marketing company, and previously as a brand manager at Square Enix Montreal. In September 2020, Miller publicly endorsed his support for Joe Biden in the 2020 United States presidential election on Twitter and on the Kinda Funny Podcast. Career IGN In early 2007, Miller relocated to San Francisco, California, as he accepted a position at entertainment website IGN as a PlayStation editor. Miller claims that he sent in numerous applications to various gaming websites including IGN, and finally received a response on his thirteenth application. He was contacted via email, interviewed via telephone and hired within the time frame of 24 hours. Miller attributes the success of the application to experience gained through his \\"Game Over\\" column in his previous job. One of his first reviews, and most notable, was his review for the video game, Lair. Miller then became a regular cast member in popular IGN podcasts such as Game Scoop! and Knockin' Boots. In June 2007, he co-founded and became a co-host on Podcast Beyond, a podcast with PlayStation news/content at its center which went on to become the number 1 PlayStation podcast in the world. At the time, his co-hosts were Jeremy Dunham, Chris Roper and Jeff Haynes. Later, Miller would host Podcast Beyond with fellow IGN editor Colin Moriarty. The two established the podcast as their own during their time with IGN and regularly had a weekly guest, usually an IGN staff member, referred to as \\"the ever-rotating third chair\\" after Andrew Goldfarb left the company. Miller was later promoted to Senior editor of the PlayStation section of IGN. In early 2013, when IGN was sold to Ziff Davis and went under restructuring, Miller was promoted to video content host for IGN, with Colin Moriarty being promoted to Miller's former position. Miller used to host the \\"Up at Noon\\" video series for IGN. Miller announced via his Kinda Funny YouTube channel on January 5, 2015, that he had left his job at IGN to focus on Kinda Funny and its new sister channel, Kinda Funny Games. YouTube On January 22, 2012, Miller created a YouTube channel, titled GameOverGreggy. His channel (later rebranded as Kinda Funny) currently has over 246,000 subscribers and over 98,000,000 views over all of his videos. Miller was inspired to produce regular content after attending VidCon 2012. The content of his videos initially consisted of discussing fan-requested topics. When the channel began, Miller uploaded new episodes of A Conversation with Colin every Tuesday and Thursday. A Conversation with Colin follows Miller and former IGN editor, friend, and roommate, Colin Moriarty, discussing fan-requested topics, e.g. why Seinfeld is the best TV show, Colin's obsession with mayonnaise, the demise of rap rock, worst restaurant experiences, etc. The show ran three seasons through February 2014. A Conversation with Colin was replaced by individual topics of The GameOverGreggy Show. Due to popular demand, A Conversation with Colin ran for a \\"final\\" fourth season consisting of twelve weekly episodes starting from January 2015. In 2012, Miller uploaded episodes of ‘‘Oreo Oration’‘ every Wednesday and Friday. Oreo Oration consists of Miller reviewing many varieties of the Oreo cookie. Miller would judge the Oreo by eating one, judging how well it tastes with milk and how clean it twists apart. The show initially ran for one season, however Miller announced in December 2013, Oreo Oration would return for a five-episode limited run due to popular demand. In January 2014, Miller started airing the second season of Oreo Oration, suggesting Miller may continue the show sporadically as new cookies are released. In 2013, Miller debuted a new series, called ‘‘Gregway’‘, in which Miller would answer and elaborate upon a fan-submitted question usually via Twitter. Previous examples include why Miller is obsessed with chicken wings, who has the best hair at IGN, Miller's love for Superman, top 5 IGN memories, etc. Through the Gregway series, Miller has collaborated with other notable personalities, including Gavin Free and Barbara Dunkelman of Rooster Teeth, voice actor Dave Fennoy and iJustine. The show aired through its first season in place of Oreo Oration. In December 2013, Miller debuted a new series, titled The GameOverGreggy Show. The show consisted of Miller, Colin Moriarty (\\"The Pride of Long Island\\" or \\"He Only Does Everything\\"), Nick Scarpino (\\"The Producer/Seducer\\") and Tim Gettys (\\"The Pure One\\") sitting around a table discussing topics that each person has prepared. The show originally came in the form of a one-dollar audio podcast through Bandcamp every Friday, and a free video podcast on YouTube every Monday. The GameOverGreggy Show occasionally included famous guests, such as Michael Rosenbaum (Smallvilles Lex Luthor) and Kevin Smith (Clerks, SModcast). In March 2014, Miller began experimenting with his upload schedule, mostly in regards to The GameOverGreggy Show. He began uploading each person's segment from the weeks episode each day from Monday to Thursday with the full show uploaded on a Friday, however if a guest is present for that podcast, their segment would also be uploaded on Friday. The reason for the schedule change was due to Miller coming to the conclusion that running three shows at once (The GameOverGreggy Show, A Conversation with Colin and Oreo Oration/Gregway) and having them edited and uploaded for each weekday proved to be tiresome. It also stemmed from fan criticism from earlier episodes of The GameOverGreggy Show, in which many found it difficult to skip to a specific topic due to a lack of navigation as to where each topic began and concluded throughout the video. Separating the topics into individual videos decisively allowed for clearer direction to any one specific topic.  Kinda Funny  RTX 2015. On September 15, 2014, Miller retired the GameOverGreggy YouTube name and rebranded it as ‘‘Kinda Funny’‘. The first video released by Kinda Funny was a parody rap video by Tim Gettys and IGN Production Coordinator Alexis Cozombolidis featuring San Francisco Giants outfielder and Cozombolidis' boyfriend Hunter Pence. As a part of the rebranding, a new series debuted in November 2014 called Follow the Liter, in which Miller, Moriarty, Scarpino or Gettys and bartender Erick Castro offer tutorials on how to make various cocktails and alcoholic beverages. On January 5, 2015, it was announced that Miller, alongside Moriarty, Scarpino and Gettys, resigned from their positions at IGN and started a new channel, Kinda Funny Games. They have since held three annual live events, each called Kinda Funny Live. Other media Miller was a recurring panel member of IGN podcasts such as Game Scoop! and Knockin' Boots. Game Scoop! is a podcast hosted by Daemon Hatfield in which Hatfield and several panel members (IGN staff) discuss recent news, fan- submitted questions, and often retro gaming themed content. Knockin' Boots was a podcast also hosted by Hatfield in which fans submit question related to dating/relationship issues and sexuality questions. As of 2013, IGN no longer funds the podcast and is now independent, therefore payment is required for each episode, which is now much longer in length (2 hours plus) and under the name \\"Super Knockin' Boots\\". Episodes of \\"Super Knockin' Boots\\" are released sporadically. At PlayStation Experience 2015, during a live episode of PS I Love You XOXO, it was announced by Arthur Parsons (game director) that Miller would have a voice role in the upcoming video game Lego Marvel's Avengers as Aldrich Killian, with references to Kinda Funny, Podcast Beyond, and Hot Pepper Gaming present in his dialogue. Miller also voices Superboy as of a recent DC Universe Online update. Miller was also cast as the starring voice role in Island Time VR, announced on the PlayStation Blog on March 24, 2018.

His first posting was at the White Dog (or Islington) Mission at the junction of the Winnipeg and Lac Seul Rivers among the Ojibwe people, now known as the Wabaseemoong Independent Nations or Whitedog First Nation. Using a syllabic method and Latin alphabet, McDonald began translating the Bible into Ojibwe (also known as Ojibwa or Chippewa , and completed the minor prophets before his next assignment. In 1862, the Church Missionary Society sent McDonald to the Yukon Territory, where he became the first Protestant missionary ever assigned to work among indigenous peoples of the Arctic. His work involved extensive travel in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, as well as what became Alaska. When gold was discovered, McDonald became the first missionary in the Klondike. He also interacted with Catholic and Russian Orthodox missionaries, sometimes sharing translators among the various tribes in his vast assigned territory. In over forty years, Rev. McDonald baptised over 2000 people, adults as well as children, and educated many at schools he established. His initial station, at Ft. Yukon, was thought to be in Canada, but turned out to be in Alaska. He later worked along the Porcupine River and established another base at Fort McPherson on the Peel River. McDonald spent most of the next four decades working among the Gwich'in people (who call themselves Dinjii Zhuu, and which was sometimes transcribed as \\"Tinjiyzoo\\"). However, in 1872, he accepted an invitation of the Church Missionary Society and took a working vacation in England, shortly after the Hudson's Bay Company sold its lands to Canada, leading to the Red River Rebellion of 1869 and finally the creation of Manitoba as the country's fifth province. In 1876, a year after McDonald received a promotion to Archdeacon of the newly created Mackenzie diocese, he married Julia Kutuq, a Gwich'in woman, with whom he eventually had nine children.http://christchurchwindsor.ca/2010/08/28/robert-mcdonald- missionary/According to Heeney, Julia and only 3 children survived their father. http://anglicanhistory.org/canada/bheeney/2/5.html McDonald achieved lasting recognition for his translations, having established an alphabet for the previously oral Gwich'in. With the help of Julia and other native speakers, McDonald translated the Bible, Book of Common Prayer and many hymns into Gwich'in (which he called Takudh and, later, Tukudh).His translation of the Book of Common Prayer is online at http://justus.anglican.org/resources/bcp/Canada/gwichin_intro.htm His translation work helped unify the various tribes speaking similar Athabaskan languages. In 1911, McDonald published a dictionary and grammar for the language under the title of A Grammar of the Tukudh Language.https://archive.org/download/cu31924097807089/cu31924097807089.pdf; https://archive.org/stream/cu31924097807089/cu31924097807089_djvu.txt Death and legacy McDonald retired in 1905 to Winnipeg, where he died at his home in 1913. He is buried in the cemetery of St. John's Cathedral in Winnipeg. His journals are in the Yukon archives in Whitehorse, as well as among the Archives of the Ecclesiastical Province of Rupert’s Land deposited with the Archives of Manitoba. The Canadian Calendar of Holy Persons of the Anglican Church of Canada remembers Rev. McDonald on August 30. The Episcopal Church (USA) recognizes Rev. McDonald, with Bishop John Horden, on December 15.http://satucket.com/lectionary/robert_mcdonald.htmhttp://liturgyandmusic.wordpress.com/2010/12/15/december-15-robert- mcdonald-priest-1913 MacDonald Avenue in Winnipeg may be named to honor him.http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/mcdonald_r.shtml References Canadian Métis people Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) Translators of the Bible into indigenous languages of the Americas Canadian Anglican priests People of Rupert's Land People from Winnipeg 1829 births 1913 deaths Anglican missionaries in Canada Anglican saints 19th-century translators Canadian biblical scholars Anglican biblical scholars 19th-century biblical scholars 19th-century Christian biblical scholars ","title":"Robert McDonald (missionary)"},{"id":"41204292","text":"Rear Admiral William Nelson Little circa 1915 Rear Admiral William Nelson Little was a British naval officer who was court martialed in 1915 on charges of negligence during his inspection of the submarine USS _K-2_.

Built in 1859 and reconstructed and expanded several times, it was judged obsolete after World War II, and in 1972 decommissioned and replaced by the newly built Katowice railway station. Three years later it was declared a National Monument. It is partially ruined and owned by a private developer who plans to renovate the station buildings and develop the complex into a multifunctional center. The station mixes neoclassical and modernist historical architecture styles and has been described as \\"one of the most interesting European railway stations from the architectural perspective\\". History The Upper Silesian Railway (Oberschlesische Eisenbahn, OSE) line, operated by the Upper Silesian Railway Company, was the first railway line in today's Poland. In 1842 it extended from Wrocław via Oława to Brzeg. In the years thereafter it was steadily expanded until it reached Katowice and Mysłowice in 1846. Shortly afterward, in 1848, OSE was connected to the Austrian Kraków and Upper Silesian Railway and the international Warsaw–Vienna railway. The train station at Katowice opened on 7 October 1846. At its inception the station was intended primarily as a maintenance and resupply stop for passing trains; Katowice was simply a convenient location en route to Mysłowice and the other railway lines to connect to. But Katowice soon grew in importance due to the train station's existence. With Baildon Steelworks and several coal mines expanding and taking advantage of the train station, Katowice quickly became one of the most important cities of Upper Silesia, receiving city rights in 1865. The city kept growing, becoming the capital of the Autonomous Silesian Voivodeship in the Second Polish Republic in the aftermath of World War I. The representative neoclassical station, completed in 1859, grew together with the city, quickly expanding beyond its original smaller purpose, and consequently, size. Near the end of the 19th century the station was split into the passenger terminal, located at the historical site, and a new cargo terminal at the site of the modern Katowice train station. A major expansion and reconstruction in the historic modernist style was completed in 1906, which is the year often given as the year the station was finished. The Polish monument listing also dates the station to that year, but other sources give 1908 as the year of reconstruction. The passenger station, originally one story with two-story avant-corps, was heightened to three stories. Two side terminal buildings were constructed, which received another expansion and reconstruction in the 1920s. The main building was used by administration, while the side terminals, incorporating the train platforms, were for passenger use. The terminals were large enough to provide additional services, from hosting commercial shops to sport facilities. By 1912 the station had seven platforms. After World War II the train station was judged obsolete, primarily because of the inefficient layout of the train platforms. The construction of the new station began in the 1950s, and the old station was closed in 1972, the year the new station opened. It was classified as a monument in 1975, listed in the National Register of Monuments with the number \\"A - 1218/75\\". Narodowy Instytut Dziedzictwa: Rejestr zabytków nieruchomych - województwo śląskie, p.68 Since then, the old train station has fallen into disrepair. Partially ruined, it has been owned since 2007 by a private developer who plans to renovate the station buildings and develop the complex into a multifunctional center. The reconstruction has been subject to repeated delays, much to the annoyance of the Katowice inhabitants. The ruined state of this historic building is one of the most controversial issues in the modern history of Katowice, leading to repeated news coverage of occasional demonstrations by concerned citizens.

The name of the hospital is derived from Gatot Soebroto, a National Hero of Indonesia. Established in 1819, the hospital is the main hospital for the Indonesian Army. The hospital also provides limited services for civilians.  History  Dutch Colonial period The Weltevreden country house, house of the governor-general of the Dutch East Indies, stands where the hospital now stand. It was demolished in 1820. The location of the hospital was formerly the country house of Governor-General Van der Parra until 1820.http://alwishahab.wordpress.com/2008/06/10/militair-hospital-jadi-rspad- gatot-subroto/ Alwi Shahab - militair-hospital-jadi-rspad-gatot-subroto When Louis Bonaparte appointed Daendels as Governor General of the Dutch East Indies in 1807, his main task is to strengthen the defense of Java to protect it from the British Army. He arrived on Java in 1808 and led the colonial government with a militaristic leadership that he gain the title IJzeren Maarschalk, the \\"Iron Marshal\\". Among his achievements is the establishment of the Militaire Geneeskundige Dienst (\\"Military Health Service\\") and three military hospitals each in Jakarta, Semarang, Surabaya. He also built garrison hospitals in or near military barracks. He was helped by J. Heppener, one of the student of Brugmans, a leading military physician who introduced the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in the Military Health Service. These hospitals were built according to Brugmans' principle: spacious, well- ventilated building, and frequently sanitized facility. In 1811, after Daendels' return to the Netherlands, Java was invaded by the British army on September, and Raffles was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Java. The British colonial period of Java happened until 1816. The former hospital of VOC, the buiten hospitaal (located in what is now Istiqlal Mosque) was the first Groot Militair Hospitaal in Batavia.According to Dirk Schoute (Het ziekenhuis en zijn geneeskundige staf, 1923) There were also the Militair Hospitaal Meester Cornelis and Militair Hospitaal Weltevreden (not at the same location with the current Gatot Subroto Army Hospital) which were built in barracks and headed by a non-commissioned officer as managemeester, so in that sense not a true hospital. The number of bed in this hospital was increased from 222 to 400 in 1819. Dutch officers in the Groot Militair Hospitaal of Weltevreden. In 1825 the number of bed was not sufficient any longer due to the increasing number of treated military members as a result of many struggles for independence in various area of Indonesia (Maluku war, Palembang war, Bone, Padri War, Java War, and so on). A change in the policy of the Cabinet of the Governor-General had made it necessary to move the Groot Militair Hospitaal into a new location which is the current location of the RSPAD Gatot Subroto. The new Groot Militair Hospital Weltevreden contains larger facility than the previous hospitals: *Six wards each of 837 feet long. *Ward for psychiatric patients. *Ward for officers of 112 feet long, linked with a building for office and guards. *A pharmacy and a residence for the pharmacist *A bathhouse and a residence for badmeester *A morgue *A kitchen and a residence for the chef *A clothing storage, a porter house and its guard house. *Stable Construction of the hospital was slow and assumed to be completed in October 1836. In this new hospital, the practice of modern medicine was started. In this hospital in 1896, Eijkman discovered the cause of beriberi, a disease of the peripheral nerves, which won him a Nobel Prize for Medicine. The military hospital also started the education for the native Javanese doctors, which pioneered the establishment of STOVIA. The CBZ The militarization of the medicine service occurred for almost a century. In 1911, a civil health service was founded and in 1919, the Centrale Burgelijke Ziekeninrichting (CBZ), the Central Civil Hospital of Batavia, was established (the hospital is now the Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital). The old building of the military hospital that is still preserved is currently used as a pharmacy for the RSPAD Gatot Subroto. Japanese occupation and Indonesian revolution On 8 March 1942, the KNIL under the leadership of Hein ter Poorten surrendered to the Japanese army under the leadership of Hitoshi Imamura. The military hospital was managed by Imperial Japanese Army as military leader of Java and known as . On 15 August 1945, the Japanese was forced to surrender by the Allies. Sukarno, on 17 August 1945, proclaimed the independence of Indonesia around the archipelago. At that time, the world, especially the Netherlands, has not recognized the independence. The governorship of Indonesia was transferred to Yogyakarta and the Rikugun Byoin was re-managed by KNIL and converted into Militair Geneeskundige Dienst, \\"Army's Department of Medicine Hospital\\", more popularly known as Leger Hospitaal Batavia, located in Hospitaal Weg, now Jalan Dr. Abdul Rahman Saleh. Independence period After the Netherlands' recognition of Indonesia's independence on December 29, 1949, one of the Dutch military medical installation called Leger Hospital Batavia was handed over to the Indonesian National Army. The official handover occurred on 26 July 1950 between the Indonesian National Army Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Satrio and KNIL Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Scheffers. The hospital was renamed as Rumah Sakit Tentara Pusat (\\"Central Army Hospital\\"), abbreviated as RSTP. RSTP was under the management of Djawatan Kesehatan Tentara Angkatan Darat (\\"Army's Department of Health\\"). When the department shortened its name 'into 'Djawatan Kesehatan Angkatan Darat, the hospital automatically renamed itself into Rumah Sakit Pusat Angkatan Darat, officially abbreviated as RUMKIT PUS-AD, but more popularly known as RSPAD. Colonel Doctor Suselo Wirjosaputro was the first TNI doctor who enters the military hospital (January 1950). He was given the task to prepare the handing over of the hospital from the Dutch army to the Indonesian national army, following the recognition of Indonesia' independence in the Round Table Conference on 29 December 1949. The conference also decided to transfer various military installations in Indonesia, among others Militaire Dienst Geneeskundige Oost Java (now Kesdam V UB) and Hospitaal Militaire in Malang (now Soepraoen Hospital) in April 1950. At that time, the hospital was headed by Colonel Doctor Van Bommel with 60 doctors (including 10 specialists), 300 Dutch nurses and 300 auxiliary nurses of Indonesian nationals and other workers e.g. kitchen staff, laundry, gardeners and other support personnel. One of the Dutch specialists that turns out able to work longer in this hospital is Borgers, a surgeon. Suselo brought new staffs for the hospital. The team was initially housed in the guestroom of female dormitory (currently in RSPAD Gatot Soebroto's medical rehab unit), later moved to the 2nd floor department of obstetrics (now used for academy of midwifery). The preparation went well at first, but later there were frequent issues between both parties. Therefore, the chairman of the Indonesian Department of Health appointed Doctor Satrio to replace Suselo to prepare the handing over. The ceremony of the handing over of the Militaire Geneeskundige Dienst (Leger Hospitaal Batavia) occurred on 26 July 1950. The Dutch history and tradition of the hospital ended after 114 years (1836 - 1950). The hospital was then converted into Rumah Sakit Tentara Pusat (RSTP) or \\"Central Army Hospital\\", managed by the Department of Medicine of the Central Army. Satrio, head of the RSTP, stayed in his official residence at Jalan Lapangan Banteng Barat No. 32, former house of surgeon Doctor Borgers (on this location now stands the office of the Indonesian Department of Religion). Old Order period (1950-1966) As the new head of the hospital, Satrio made sure the existing Dutch nurses were not treated discriminatively. Several Indonesian doctors from the Central General Hospital, as well as new Indonesian graduates, were transferred to the Military Hospital. A nurse school was established in 1951, now the Academy of Nursing and Midwifery. On March 1, 1952, Satrio gave his position to the new head of the Military Hospital Reksodiwirjo Wijotoardjo. Due to the political and economic condition at the time, not much improvements were done for the hospital. At this time the hospital name was changed from Rumah Sakit Tentara Pusat to Rumah Sakit Pusat Angkatan Darat (\\"Army Central Hospital\\"). In 1957, Gatot Soebroto, at the time served as Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, built workshop facilities for orthopedics, physiotherapy, basketball court, and a dorm. He also moved the existing orthopedic workshops from Dustira Military Hospital, Bandung. This workshop is now a room for psychiatric.

In April he clinched the Monegasque Championships by beating Marcel Bernard in a five set match. He also took the doubles title with von Metaxa defeating Daniel Prenn and Vladimir Landau. In March 1938 he was victorious at the Cannes L.T.C. tournament where he eliminated Swedish champion Karl Schroeder. Schroeder took revenge in the doubles final where he teamed up with seasoned player Jacques Brugnon of the Four Musketeers to stop the Baworowski-von Metaxa duo in a five set match. At the French Championships, Baworowski reached the fourth round in 1937 and 1938. At Wimbledon, he lost his initial match on three occasions (1933, 1936, 1939). After the \\"Anschluss\\", the annexation of Austria into Nazi Germany, in March 1938, Baworowski decided to join the Polish Davis Cup team as he didn't want to lose his family's estates in Poland. Upon arrival in Poland he gave a few interviews, condemning the \\"Anschluss\\" and the policy of the Nazi authorities. His statements were widely covered in the Western media. He joined the Legia Warsaw and on 3 May 1938 he participated in a friendly match between Poland and Germany, and a few days later played in a match in a Legia Warsaw- Stockholm meeting. He quickly moved up to second place on the list of Polish Tennis Association right behind Ignacy Tłoczyński. He was victorious again in the doubles at the Katowice tournament partnering Tłoczyński and the duo represented Poland in the Central European Cup and claimed the trophy after beating Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. The last peaceful season in 1939 kicked off well for him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sponsored Baworowski French Riviera tour and it paid off well. At Cannes he was only beaten in the final by Yvon Petra. In Juan-les-Pins he proved to be unstoppable and defeated Robert Abdesselam for the title and carried on this streak at Nice through the final against Antoine Gentien. After this great season opener he suffered injury, which affected his Davis Cup tie against Germany and in the French Championships. However he was a doubles semifinalist along with Ignacy Tłoczyński at Roland Garros. Despite his bad shape he still secured the Polish National Doubles championship alongside Tłoczyński.  World War II and death  At the outbreak of World War II, after returning from Monaco with a silver medal of the 1939 International University Games Baworowski was residing in Paris where his family lived. When he heard about the outbreak of the war he was determined to join the Polish army although his parents begged him to stay. When he arrived to the East Railway Station of Warsaw, The German Luftwaffe was already bombarding the area. The passengers fled from the trains to nearby trenches. Apparently he was successfully enlisted. The next time he met his cousin Eugene Paul Baworowski in the streets of Warsaw in the first days of occupation he was about to get in touch with the Polish Resistance. As the 6 September 1939 decree issued by the Wehrmacht command pursued every Polish citizen who reached the military age to be sent to a POW camp the Gestapo soon arrested and sent him to a camp. Only his ties to the Chorinsky noble family and to the former Austrian Tennis Federation saved him from further reprisals. In 1941, he took part in the German war championships at Braunschweig and reached the final which he lost to Kurt Gies in five sets. He was practising in the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin. He further represented Germany in the Danube Cup, which was a wartime substitute for the Central European Cup. Baworowski later joined the German Wehrmacht and was killed in action in the beginning of 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad. He served as a Hauptmann. On December 21, 1942, when the Luftwaffe evacuated his troops he ceded his place on the last flight to a heavily injured soldier and decided to stay in the trenches with his subordinates. He was hit by the Soviets and died in agony without receiving any medical help. Playing style According to Kordian Tarasiewicz contemporary senior Polish tennis Player Baworowski was \\"[...] was a well established tennis player on the European courts and represented a versatile offensive [style], especially had a well mastered game at the net\\".

The Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement, commonly abbreviated CSSTA and sometimes alternatively translated Cross-Strait Agreement on Trade in Services, is a treaty between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China on Taiwan, signed in June 2013 but never ratified by the Nationalist Chinese legislature, aimed at liberalizing trade in services between the two economies. Under the terms of the treaty, service industries such as banking, healthcare, tourism, film, telecommunications, and publishing would be opened to investment and businesspeople would be able to obtain indefinitely renewable visas for the other territory. It would become easier for businesses to set up offices and branches in the other territory and for large stakes in businesses to be sold to the other party’s investors. The CSSTA is one of two planned follow-up treaties to the 2010 Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement. The other, the Cross-Strait Goods Trade Agreement, has not yet been negotiated. In March 2014 the Sunflower Student Movement began. The movement opposed the CSSTA, protesting the agreement on the grounds that the Kuomintang (KMT) leadership in Taiwan negotiated and attempted ratification through undemocratic processes. Diplomatic and legislative history The CSSTA was negotiated and signed by the Straits Exchange Foundation, representing Taiwan, and the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, representing mainland China, on June 21, 2013, in Shanghai. The leadership of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) had hoped to immediately send the treaty to the legislature to be ratified, but substantial concern about the closed-door negotiations and the potential effects of the treaty among opposition lawmakers, academics, civic organizations, and ordinary citizens compelled the KMT leadership to agree on June 25, 2013, to a clause-by-clause review of the treaty and a series of public hearings on its possible effects. On March 17, 2014, after a continuing standstill in the legislature over the review process, KMT leadership asserted that the review process had exceeded the allotted time and was to be considered complete, and the CSSTA would therefore be submitted to a final vote on March 21. The legality of this action is debated by experts. Public protest in response began that night, expressing disapproval of the purportedly antidemocratic behavior of the KMT as well as long-simmering discontent with the CSSTA. The protests quickly developed into the Sunflower Student Movement. Media reports in May 2016 indicated that the new DPP government will seek ratification of the agreement in the near future based on a bill supervising cross-strait talks and agreements.Taiwan to continue talks with China over trade-in-goods agreement. Retrieved 2016-05-30. Content The text of the CSSTA, including its two appendices (“Schedules of Specific Commitments on Trade in Services” and “Specific Provisions of Service Suppliers”), is in total approximately 50 pages long. (in chinese) The main text enumerates rules regarding transparency requirements, administration of regulatory measures, prevention of unfair competition, an emergency negotiation mechanism, free movement of payments and capital transfers, and a principle of fair and equitable treatment. The first appendix, “Schedules of Specific Commitments on Trade in Services,” lists service sectors or sub-sectors and related commitments on market liberalization of the two parties. The schedule is a “positive list,” meaning that service sectors or subsectors not explicitly listed in the schedule are not subject to increased opening. Up to 64 Taiwanese industries and up to 80 Chinese industries will be opened. Affected industries include business services, communication services, construction and related engineering services, distribution services, environmental services, health-related and social services, tourism and travel-related services, recreational, cultural, and sporting services, transport services, and financial services. The two parties made commitments on eliminating or reducing limitations on equity participation, expanding business scope in terms of geography or lines of business, and undertaking trade facilitation measures. Considering the controversial issue of labor movement, both sides agreed to apply the “Annex on Movement of Natural Persons Supplying Services” under the GATS to this agreement, meaning that this agreement will not apply to any governmental measures affecting natural persons seeking access to the employment market of either Party, nor will it apply to measures regarding citizenship, residence or employment on a permanent basis. However, qualified executives from China and relatives thereof may seek 3-year visas in Taiwan, and no limit is placed on the number of times the 3-year visas may be renewed. The CSSTA includes an article to mandate future negotiations of market access on the basis of consensus. It also provides for a communication mechanism between both sides to monitor implementation. Opposition The CSSTA has been a subject of intense controversy in Taiwan. Advocates of the treaty argue that increased Chinese investment would provide a necessary boost to Taiwan’s economy, that the still-unspecified details of the treaty’s implementation can be worked out favorably for Taiwan, and that to “pull out” of the treaty by not ratifying it would damage Taiwan’s international credibility. The treaty’s opponents argue that the treaty would benefit large companies while devastating small and medium-sized Taiwanese businesses, that Chinese investment in the publishing industry, coming on top of currently substantial Chinese investment in the news media, would imperil free speech in Taiwan, and that the treaty would in effect lay the groundwork for eventual political unification with mainland China. More than 200 professors and industry experts have issued joint statements and held panel discussions warning the national security risks in the liberalization of the type II telecommunication services outlined in the trade pact. Activists representation of the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement's deal opacity. The chair of Economy Department in Taiwan University, Professor Zen Xiuling, pointed out that the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement opened 64 sectors in Taiwanese market. These 64 sectors in fact encompass thousands of businesses in Taiwan, including transportation, telecommunication, and all kinds of whole-sale/retail business that are intrinsically related to national security and the sustainability of small-to- medium businesses. Governmental officials in charge of the negotiation with China prioritize the privileged financial groups at the expense of national welfare. Opening Taiwan to China without reservation will render the island's infrastructures—both in commodity and capital circulation—to Chinese control. Sending Taiwanese specialists to China, \\"our economy will soon be controlled completely by China.\\"反黑箱服貿20社團上凱道. 蘋果日報. [2013-07-29] （中文（繁體））. Taking example from the 5-year FTA negotiation between the US and South Korea, Zen Xiuling suggested, \\"the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement can be modified, and we demand the Legislative Yuan [parliament] to re-negotiate with China.\\" At the public hearing for the CSSTA on July 31, 2013, Zen Xiuling reasserted her point: the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement opens Taiwan's telecommunication industry, whole-sale/retail businesses, and printing/publication industry to China, threatening the national security, economy, and freedom of speech in Taiwan. She therefore urged the government to renegotiate with China based on the example of the US-South Korea FTA negotiation.鄭秀玲, 兩岸服貿協議對我國的衝擊分析 (PDF文件). 2013-07-25 On May 21, Democratic Progressive Party legislators criticized the Mainland Affairs Council for classifying the disadvantages of the trade accord and releasing only information it considers favorable to the agreement. Responding to the questions, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi said that the classified information was to be used for reference only within the government. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cho Shih-chao said that research produced by academics is only used for internal reference for decisionmaking. However, neither official explained why only poll numbers favorable to the government's position have been released to the public, while others were not. Public opinion A March 2014 survey by the Taiwanese magazine Business Week indicated that 56.3% of Taiwanese opposed the treaty and 22.3% supported it. However 80.9% of those polled claimed to lack sufficient knowledge about the agreement. A poll sanctioned by the Mainland Affairs Council and run by National Chengchi University in May 2014 showed a closer split in opinion, with 42.5% supporting the service agreement, and 40.1% opposing it. A majority of the people polled supported immediate deliberation and clause-by-clause review of the CSSTA, along with more transparency in the negotiation process and improved communication within the government about pacts with China, and future review of all cross-strait pacts by the Executive Yuan and National Security Council. A bill intended to provide oversight on accords with China was proposed in April 2015, but did not make it to committee. Sunflower Student Movement Protesters outside the Legislative Yuan On March 18, 2014, protesters occupied the Legislative Yuan to raise their concern about the trade accord, which was forced to the legislative floor without proper due process. The protest, peaking at more than 500,000 people, is the largest student-led protest in Taiwan's history. Thousands of riot police from the National Police Agency were mobilized during the protests.

Early life and career Born in a refugee camp in Kenya to South Sudanese parents, Aliir's family moved to Australia when he was eight years old, eventually settling in Brisbane. After learning to kick a football at Kedron State High School, he was invited by a friend to play Australian rules football for the Aspley Hornets as a 14-year-old. Within a few years, he had made the Queensland side and was invited to play for the world XVIII at the under-16 championships in Sydney. It was during this trip that Aliir discovered he had a long-lost sister trying to contact him. In 2012, Aliir's mother, brothers and sisters moved to Perth to reunite with extended family. Aliir decided to remain in Brisbane, and that year, he made his debut in the NEAFL for Aspley. Aliir made his mark as a ruckman in 2012 while playing for the Hornets and the Queensland Under-18 Scorpions. After being overlooked in the 2012 AFL draft, Aliir made the decision to relocate to Perth to live with his family. There he joined the East Fremantle Football Club and spent the 2013 season playing for the club's Colts team. With East Fremantle, he was converted from a ruckman to a defender. AFL career Aliir was drafted by the Sydney Swans at pick 44 in the 2013 AFL draft, becoming the first player of Sudanese heritage taken in the National Draft. Aliir had a promising debut season with the Swans reserves in the NEAFL. Unfortunately, he suffered a dislocated shoulder mid-season, and was ruled out for the remainder of the year in round 16, which resulted in him missing the team's 2014 NEAFL finals campaign. After a slow start, 2015 was another solid year of development in the NEAFL for Aliir, playing mainly as a key defender. Aliir played 16 games and averaged 16 possessions at more than 80 per cent efficiency and took the most marks (86) for the Swans reserves. Heading into the 2016 AFL season, Aliir was in line to take over from Ted Richards in Sydney's defence. Aliir made his long-awaited AFL debut against the Brisbane Lions at the Gabba in Round 6, 2016. He quickly cemented his place in the team after round 16, as he played in every match between then and the Swans' preliminary final match. However, in the preliminary final, Aliir suffered a low-grade medial strain late in the first quarter of their win over Geelong. The injury consequently ruled him out of the Grand Final. The Swans went on to lose the Grand Final by 22 points to the Western Bulldogs. Personal Aliir is the cousin of Matur Maker who plays for the Rio Grande Valley Vipers of the NBA G League and NBA player Thon Maker, who currently plays for the Detroit Pistons.

Plot An 80-year-old man travels on a rural road in his single-seat car. When his radiator overheats, he heads to a nearby water pump to cool it. While he cools, someone comes and rides away with his vehicle. Not knowing what to do after his car was stolen, the man comes to a soft drink stand operated by a black civet. Despite the stand being labelled \\"soda\\", the beverages served there seem to give customers depressant-like effects such as drowsiness. The man orders a soda bottle, but is unable to open it. As an alternative, the civet offers soda in a glass. Upon drinking the beverage, he starts to twitch and lose consciousness. The man dreams of himself in space, being thrown from one rock to another. On one rock he meets an invisible entity wearing a hat, gloves, and boots. The entity sells the man a bottle of soda, but as he is about to drink, the bottle vanishes. When he goes on looking for it, another pair of boots approaches and kicks him from behind, sending him airborne. He lands on a rising umbrella, but trouble from a pesky bird causes him to fall off. He then falls onto some terrain with soft bumps that repeatedly expand and contract. After the bumps send him floating again, he is met again by the civet on a boat who tosses him a ring attached to a rope. When he tries to reach the boat, a meteor comes and strikes the vessel. With no aid left, he tries in vain to swim himself to safety. Finally waking up from his soda- manifested dream, the man finds himself being watched by the civet and various other stand patrons. He soon learns that the beverages are not good for consumption, and goes on to reveal himself as a sheriff by showing a brass star on his chest. The uncovered sheriff pulls out a gun and shoos away everybody at the scene. Home media The short is included in the Giant 600 Cartoon Collection.

Her father, Philip Hayes, was an Anglican priest from England who was the headmaster of Elizabeth College which prepared boys for matriculation. Her ancestors were very musical and were associated with the work of George Frederick Handel in England. She was the eighth and youngest surviving child of her parents' ten children. Her parents ensured that she received a sound education, was fluent in both French and English and encouraged her love of literature. After the deaths of both her parents, in the 1840s Hayes moved to England, where she took employment as a teacher in London and Oxford. There she came under the influence of the Oxford Movement and in 1850 became one of the first members of the Anglican Community of St Mary the Virgin and was given the religious name of Sister Mary Ignatius of Jesus. After being a qualified principal and a leader of her community for some years, she was received into the Catholic Church and joined the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception, who lived in Greenwich and later in Bayswater, under the leadership of Mother Elizabeth Lockhart, who were committed to serving the poor of London. In 1858 she received the religious habit from the future cardinal, Henry Edward Manning, but chose to go to Scotland to do her novitiate under the Tertiary Franciscan Sisters of Glasgow, founded in the mid-15th century, who traced their heritage back to Angela of Foligno. She professed her vows on 26 November 1859. In addition to the traditional three religious vows, she made a fourth vow to dedicate her life to the foreign missions. She wrote in her diary at the time, \\"God calls me to leave my home and country and to join a foreign mission\\". Missionary life After her religious profession, Hayes was sent to the island of Jamaica, where she hoped to work to serve the African population who worked the plantations of the British colony. She was deeply disappointed to be assigned to teach the daughters of the colonial plantation owners. She was recalled to Europe, where she soon opened a school in Sèvres, France. Eventually she was allowed to explore her call to serve in the missions. =Minnesota= Following her sense of vocation, Hayes sought to find where she could best be of service. Receiving an invitation from Thomas Langdon Grace, O.P., the Bishop of St. Paul in Minnesota, she went to a remote section of the United States. She established herself in the village of Belle Prairie in 1872, along with a few companions, where they worked with the children of Canadian immigrants. They became established there as the Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. The following year she opened St. Anthony's Academy for girls, operating out of the log cabin in which she and her companions lived. In 1874, Hayes founded the first Franciscan journal in English, the Annals of Our Lady of the Angels, which continued to be published for the next century. =Poor Clare project= Hayes hoped to recruit new members from the existing religious communities in Italy, who were anxious about their futures under the Kingdom of Italy after its annexation of the Papal States. Traveling to Rome in 1875, she approached Friar Bernardino da Portoguaro, the Minister General of the Friars Minor, hoping to have some friars sent to her section of Minnesota to serve the vast territory. Additionally, she contacted other communities of Franciscan Sisters, but found no interest in her proposal to serve in America. She then conceived of the advantage of having a contemplative presence as a part of her foundation, which would also have the practical effect of providing a resident priest for their spiritual needs living in such a remote region, with only one priest serving the entire county. She then turned to the Poor Clares, the Franciscan Second Order who are an enclosed religious order, and visited the Monastery of San Lorenzo in Panisperna, an ancient community of the Order. Speaking to the nuns of the community there, she set forth her proposal to provide them a monastery on the grounds of her school. Three of the nuns volunteered to go with her, among whom was Mary Magdalen Bentivoglio, O.S.C. Hayes wrote to Friar Bernardino, who also had authority over the nuns, as well as various officials of the Vatican whose permission would be needed for such an enterprise. With her persistence, eventually the plan was approved by Pope Pius IX, with Bentivoglio named as the abbess of the new monastery, which was to be the first monastery of the Poor Clares in the United States. Hayes organized the journey of the two nuns who were commissioned for the new foundation, along with a Franciscan friar who was to serve as their spiritual director and chaplain. They set sail from Marseilles on 11 September 1875, arriving in New York City the following 12 October, Columbus Day. Once arrived in New York, however, the friar expressed qualms about proceeding to Minnesota with Hayes, and decided to wait for further instructions from the Minister General. He advised the nuns to do the same. Despite their quandary over this breaking of their commitment to Hayes, the Poor Clares decided to do so until they too received instructions from the Minister General. Bentivoglio later recorded the conversation in which they had to break the bad news to Hayes. > We begged her not to bear us any ill since it was not our fault. Poor Mother > Ignatius felt the refusal very much; yet having no binding claim upon us, > she resigned herself to the inevitable and departed from us with sorrows and > grief in her heart. =Georgia= Hayes returned to Minnesota without the Poor Clares, but within five years of her original arrival there, the small community had grown to six professed Sisters, and had several candidates in the novitiate Hayes had opened. With her missionary visionary, and her experience in Jamaica, she then turned her focus on serving the African American population of the Southern United States. In the summer of 1879 Hayes led nine other Franciscan Sisters to establish a convent on the Isle of Hope in the State of Georgia, where they taught the children of the recently freed slaves, who were still denied access to education by the institutions of the region, including those of the Catholic Church. The community soon moved to Savannah, where they operated a school under the auspices of William Hickley Gross, C.Ss.R., the Bishop of Savannah. =Rome= Hayes returned to Rome in 1880, and met with Pope Leo XIII, who suggested that the novitiate of the new congregation be established there, in keeping with its missionary character. Hayes complied with this request, and the candidates for the congregation were then sent there. One of them was Frederica Law, a student at the school in Savannah, who was the first African-American member of the congregation. Hayes remained in Italy for her work. Unable to keep in touch with the small community she had left behind in Minnesota, by 1893 she determined to return to the United States to be with them. She left for Naples the following year, intending to set sail for America from there, but took ill. She returned to Rome, where she soon died. Legacy The Missionary Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception established a mission in Egypt in 1898. This was followed by communities in Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Ireland, Papua New Guinea and Peru. In 1964, the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of England, now in Braintree, Essex, which had been Hayes' first religious community as a Roman Catholic, merged with the Missionary Sisters. The united congregation currently number about 250 members. The community in Belle Prairie struggled on for many years without word from Hayes, until finally word reached them of her death. The Sisters continued to operate the academy until it was burned down under suspicious circumstances in 1889. Having lost everything, the Sisters relocated to Little Falls, Minnesota. From there a number of the Sisters decided to travel to Italy to join the rest of the congregation. Sixteen Sisters chose to remain, and, on 1 March 1891, re-organized themselves as the Franciscan Sisters of the Immaculate Conception of Little Falls, a congregation of diocesan right under the Diocese of Saint Cloud. Currently numbering about 150 Sisters, they primarily serve in Minnesota, but have missions throughout the United States, as well as in Ecuador and Mexico. In 1893, in answer to request from the people of Rock Island, Illinois, a group of Franciscan Sisters left Little Falls to establish St. Anthony's Hospital there. They soon separated to become an autonomous congregation.

He is the son of Russell Middlemiss, a Geelong premiership player in 1951 and 1952. Middlemiss played his early football at Geelong West in the Victorian Football Association.The Age, \\"Glenn takes his chances\\", 5 April 1977, p. 17 While playing for Geelong West, against Williamstown in 1977, Middlemiss was knocked unconscious in an accidental collision, after which he was clinically dead for two-and-a-half minutes. The match was stopped for 20 minutes as he was attended to by trainers and a doctor, who gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, cardiac massage and oxygen. Part of a fence had to be taken down so that an ambulance could come onto the field. After recovering, Middlemiss resumed his career, against doctors' advice. A utility, Middlemiss was used mostly as a defender and up forward in his VFL career, which started at Geelong in 1979. He made 19 appearances in 1980, two of them finals, including Geelong's four point preliminary final loss to Collingwood. His most notable performance came in round eight, when he kicked seven goals against St Kilda at Kardinia Park. During the 1981 VFL season, Middlemiss moved to St Kilda and played nine games for his new club that year. He added only seven more appearances over the next three seasons. In his last year at the club, 1984, he was suspended five times, for a total of nine games. The first was a two match ban for striking Hawthorn's Russell Morris in a reserves fixture.Canberra Times, \\"Tribunal ousts another Saint\\", 29 May 1984, p. 15 He then got a two match ban for striking Mark Buckley in Collingwood's round six game against Carlton.

About Cobra Gold Royal Thai and U.S. military training together during Cobra Gold 2020 Cobra Gold was first held in 1982. Cobra Gold has served as a military training exercise to improve coordination between the armed forces of the United States and Thailand in both hostile military and humanitarian efforts. It also had the goal of strengthening ties between the U.S. and Thailand, the oldest ally of the United States in the South Asia region. More recently, Cobra Gold has served a humanitarian mission, as military personnel deliver health care to the local Thai population, and as a testing ground for new battlefield technologies such as solar powered weaponry. As of 2020, Cobra Gold has several distinct activities that highlight regional security and effective responses to regional crises. The first is the Combined Arms Live Fire Exercise (CALFEX), in which live ammunition is aimed at predetermined targets as troops advance and close in on their target. A Command Post Exercise (CPX), in which military officers engage in computerized war games, disaster relief, or humanitarian missions over several days. An Amphibious Exercise (AMPHIBEX) which combines the capabilities of ship-to-shore movement with vertical envelopment between the Royal Thai Armed Forces and U.S. military, with allied forces dependent on operational developments. A Cyber Exercise (CYBEREX) which demonstrates the multinational interaction and exchange in a scenario based on rehearsing defensive cyber operations. Ongoing activities are various humanitarian civic activities, assisting the local Thai population throughout the kindgom. In 2020, Cobra Gold is introducing a landmine reduction operation as well as the participation of the U.S. Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II fighter aircraft and the high mobility artillery rocket system (HIMARS). These new additions will enhance security cooperation and advanced interoperability to increase partner capacity in planning and executing complex and realistic multinational force and combined task force operations.U.S. Marines assault the beach as part of the amphibious beach landing at Hat Yao Beach, Thailand, during Cobra Gold 2020 Cobra Gold has expanded to include 27 nations as of 2020, including Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and other South Asian and Pacific Ocean countries. China was admitted to Cobra Gold exercises for the first time in 2015 as well, although Chinese military forces were only allowed to participate in humanitarian assistance training. Most nations participate in Cobra Gold as observers rather than participants. In 2020, the following countries are set to participate in the exercise: *Participants: the United States, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia *Observers: Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Israel, Vietnam, Germany, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Sweden *Multinational Planning Augmentation Team: Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Nepal, the Philippines, Fiji and New Zealand *Others: China and India.https://asianmilitaryreview.com/2018/01/more- nations-to-take-part-in-cobra-gold/ Recent Cobra Gold exercises U.S. Marines participate in the amphibious beach landing at Hat Yao Beach, Thailand during Cobra Gold 2020 Participants in Cobra Gold 2013 included the United States, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. Twenty other nations participated in observer status. For the first time, Burma joined the exercise (as an observer). Exercises held during Cobra Gold 2013 included an amphibious landing involving ground assault fighter jets, attack helicopters, and landing craft; mock military raids involving small boats and helicopters; a practice evacuation involving civilian populations; a combined arms exercise held while live fire occurred overhead and nearby; and training in biological, chemical, jungle, nuclear, and radiological warfare. Admiral Samuel J. Locklear III, commander of the United States Pacific Command, described Cobra Gold as \\"the Pacific's signature exercise\\" in 2014, and noted that it was among the largest multinational military exercise in which U.S. armed forces participate. The United States reduced its participation in Cobra Gold 2015 to signal its disapproval of the military coup which occurred in Thailand in 2014. The U.S. sent 3,600 troops to the exercise in 2015, down from 4,300 in 2014. The U.S. also cancelled the exercise in which troops practiced under live fire during an amphibious landing. However, American military forces did participate in a civilian evacuation training exercise, and the operation of U.S. troops in formation in the field in cooperation with the military forces of other nations. Nevertheless, more than 13,000 military personnel from six nations actively participated in Cobra Gold 2015, while other nations participated as observers. U.S. and Royal Thai Marines learn jungle survival techniques during Cobra Gold 2020 The United States postponed its participation in a March 2015 meeting with Thailand to begin planning for Cobra Gold 2016. American military officials indicated they might cancel the exercise outright as a protest against continuing military rule in Thailand. Exercise Cobra Gold 2017 U.S. Marine assault amphibious vehicles (AAVs) during amphibious beach landing during Cobra Gold 2020 In 2017, there were 29 nations that participated in Cobra Gold either directly or as observers. This year is 36th anniversary of Cobra Gold exercise co-hosted by Thailand and United States between 14 and 24 of February 2017. Cobra Gold 2017 aims to improve capabilities among the participating nations, joint operation, civic action and do build up relationship between Thailand and United States when power seizure in 2014 Thai-US relations have fallen. Cobra Gold 2017 aims to improve capabilities among the participating nations, joint operation, civic action The field exercises including variety of training, such as Amphibious Assault Demonstration, EOD mission, Close Air Support (CAS) and Combined Arms Live Fire Exercise (CALFEX) which is an exercise on strategical engagement by using various types of weapons. In civic action, were included humanitarian assistance and Non-combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO). NEO was led by Japan Air Self Defense Force (JASDF) during disaster relief operation. Mostly, a NEO used to move noncombatant personnel from dangerous area, usually caused by natural disaster For 2018, the US has urged to remove Myanmar as observers due to the Rohingya crisis.https://www.mmtimes.com/news/myanmars-place-cobra- gold-draws-ire.html  Exercise Cobra Gold 2020  U.S. Marine F-35Bs conducting flight operations during Cobra Gold 2020 There are 27 nations from around the world participating in the 39th iteration of Cobra Gold to take place from February 25 to March 6, 2020. Similar to previous years, Cobra Gold 20 seeks to improve the capabilities of participating nations to plan and conduct combined and joint operations; build relationships among participating nations across the region; and improve interoperability over a range of activities, enhancing maritime security, preventing and mitigating emerging disease threats, and responding to large-scale natural disasters. Cobra Gold 20 emphasizes coordination on civic action, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, seeking to expand regional cooperation and collaboration in these vital areas. For the first time, Cobra Gold 20 is introducing a new landmine reduction operation as well as the participation of the Marine Corps F-35B Lightning II fighter aircraft and High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems. The F-35Bs bring more lethality and flexibility to combat commanders than any other fighter platform, combining next-generation fighter characteristics of radar-evading stealth, sensor fusion, fighter agility and advanced logistical support with the most powerful and comprehensive integrated sensor package of any fighter aircraft in history. The HIMARS purpose is to conduct bilateral training at the battery-level on the weapon system, developing interoperability between the U.S., the RTAF, and other regional nations and partners. Continuity of exercises such as Cobra Gold demonstrates the commitment of the Kingdom of Thailand, and the United States to our long-standing alliance. Outcomes The United States has engaged in only a single, very minor military intervention in the Pacific area since the end of the Vietnam War, making it difficult to judge Cobra Gold's effectiveness in improving warfighting capabilities and coordination. Cobra Gold has, however, proven effective in improving coordinated military response to natural disasters, including the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the 2011 Tōhoku tsunami, and disaster relief provided to the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan struck in November 2013.

It is a red to dark brown ant with a shiny body, and varies in shade across its range. Colonies of this ant are found in a variety of habitats, where they excavate underground nests with galleries and chambers. In some parts of its range, the nests may be raided by slave-making ants, most notably Formica pergandei and Polyergus montivagus. Description The workers of F. pallidefulva are very similar in appearance to those of F. incerta, but are more glossy. They have little pubescence on the mesosoma and the gaster has only a scant covering of short hairs. This ant is very variable in colour. Northern populations are deep brownish-black, but southern types are bright, coppery yellow, and various intermediate colour combinations occur in the central part of its range. Even among the workers of a colony, a considerable degree of variation exists in colouring, but none of these variations seems to be taxonomically significant. Distribution and habitat F. pallidefulva is found in eastern North America from southeastern Canada and the eastern United States westwards to the Great Plains and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains from Wyoming to New Mexico. It is a common species and is found in a variety of habitats, including grassland, woodland, forest, rough ground, lawns, parks and campuses. Behaviour The nest of F. pallidefulva is excavated below ground and consists of one or more horizontal galleries near the surface from which descend one or two vertical galleries about in diameter and up to long. A typical nest has about 18 chambers in which the ants live, radiating off the horizontal and vertical galleries and measuring about , each having a level floor and domed roof. The entrance is inconspicuous and up to in diameter, sometimes in open ground and sometimes concealed. About a quarter of the nests have two entrances. A mound is not usually seen on the surface above the nest, but a newly excavated entrance may be surrounded by a halo of ejected soil. In forested areas, nests may be dug under bark on old tree stumps or in rotten logs, and in grassland, a small mound may be formed above a nest in or beside a clump of grass. F. pallidefulva is diurnal and worker ants spend the night in the nest and emerge from the nest in the morning to forage. In many nests, about three-quarters of the larvae are not enclosed in a cocoon when they pupate, but the proportion varies from nest to nest and from year to year. Male and female alates emerge from larvae that have overwintered and pupated in late spring. They fly in late summer, having emerged from the nest a few at a time, and launched themselves into the air individually. The flights generally take place in the morning around the time the sun reaches the nest. When a newly fertilised female alights, she breaks off her wings and excavates a small chamber in which to lay her eggs. She remains there, feeding the larvae that hatch on regurgitated food, and the first batch of workers is stunted through lack of adequate nourishment. More eggs are laid by the queen and reared by the new workers, which also go out to forage and enlarge the nest. Nests generally contain a single queen and grow in size over the years. No reproductives are produced until the colony is large and mature enough. In the event that a nest site is inadequate for further colony development, a new site can be found and the colony can migrate, the workers carrying the larvae and pupae. Formica pallidefulva (Field Ant) Queen Queen, host workers, and brood of Polyergus montivagus with host F. pallidefulva The nests of F. pallidefulva are sometimes raided by the slave-making ant Polyergus montivagus. The raiding ants are known as slavemaker or dulotic ants and the raided ones as slaves or hosts, and the pupae and larvae of the host are carried off. They are taken back to the dulotic nest and reared there by host ants already present in the nest. When they emerge from their pupae, they join the mixed colony's workforce.  The Beginning of a Colony   Queen and First Clutch  Field ant queens, the reproductive females in their colony, also are generally the largest. Their primary function is reproduction. Typically, an ant queen will seek to found a new colony following a nuptial flight. They are claustral, meaning that they will create a small hole in the ground and lay their first batch of 4-7 eggs there; not leaving throughout the whole process. The eggs will hatch into larvae roughly seven days after being laid. For the next week the queen will care for the larvae until they begin to form into pupae. Field ant larvae create cocoons for their pupae stage. The pupae will emerge from their cocoons roughly two weeks after forming them.Wajaworld- Ant Keeper of Formica pallidefulva Once emerged, these new ants will spend 3–10 days in the nest or until their exoskeletons are completely hardened.

Design and development In 1929 Luigi Teichfuss produced the Nibio I, his first primary glider with a conventional fuselage rather than an open girder frame. Ten years later he designed an improved version, the Balilla. It was a simple, low cost, robust, high wing, strut braced monoplane with an unswept, constant chord, elliptically tipped wing. Mounted with dihedral, this was supported over the fuselage on a narrow pedestal and braced on each side by a parallel pair of faired lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wings at about half span. Its fuselage was wood framed, flat sided and plywood skinned. Its cockpit, open but with a small windscreen, was immediately ahead of the wing leading edge; there were no instruments. The Balilla's tail surfaces were all straight edged: the tailplane, single strut braced from below, had a sharply swept leading edge and carried elevators with angled tips and a cut-out for rudder movement. The vertical tail was tapered with a squared tip; the rudder reached to the keel, where it was protected by a wire loop tail bumper. Elevators and the rudder lacked aerodynamic balances. A conventional skid, running from the nose to below the wing trailing edge formed the undercarriage. The Ballila first flew in 1939. Ten were built, serving all the gliding schools of the R.U.N.A. It could be winch launched and was straightforward to fly, training novice pilots to their B-certificate.

The film received a VOD (video on demand) and theatrical release by Lionsgate on August 22, 2014. Plot Paul, a mechanic, speaks to his daughter Beth on video chat. Though she seems stressed and distracted, she says that she is fine. The two make plans for her coming visit back home after finals. Paul later receives a letter from the college which indicates that Beth has not paid tuition, and a stranger answers her phone. Paul doesn't contact the police and flies to where his daughter lives to personally investigate his daughter's disappearance. At Beth's apartment, he finds a picture of her and another young woman whom he assumes to be one of her friends. He finds her at a local bar, and she introduces herself as Angela. She reluctantly tells Paul that Beth has dropped out of college and fallen in with local drug dealers. Paul offers to pay Angela $500 to take him to New Orleans, Beth's last known location, and identify her dealer, Eddie. When Angela points out one of Eddie's friends, Paul demands Eddie's location. The man refuses and attacks Paul, knocking him to the ground. Paul viciously beats the man and his two friends. Although disturbed by the show of violence, Angela helps Paul set up a meeting with Eddie through a cell phone that they take from his friend. At a club, Eddie denies any knowledge of Beth and ignores Paul's threats until his uncle, who witnessed Paul kill seven armed men twenty years ago, convinces Eddie to talk. Eddie says that Beth has moved on to harder drugs than he supplies and lives with a local drug kingpin known as The Pharmacy. Paul pays Angela the $500 he promised her and tells her to return home, but she refuses, as she wants to know what has happened to her friend. Paul reluctantly accepts her continued help. Two thugs trail Paul and attempt to force his car off the road. Paul instead causes them to crash, and he interrogates the passenger, who reveals that he works for local crime-boss Omar. Paul tells the passenger to warn Omar to stay out of his way and kills the driver as he lies helpless and wounded on the ground. Angela insists that Paul explain himself. Paul tells her that he used to be a mob hit man for Omar, but the escalating violence caused him to question his loyalty. In a botched attempt to kill Omar, he accidentally killed Omar's wife and daughter instead. Now, Omar desires revenge, and Paul knows that Omar will stop at nothing to use his daughter to get to him. Paul makes arrangements with an old friend and former partner, Sam, to keep Angela safe while he recovers weaponry stashed with an old contact and confronts The Pharmacy. The Pharmacy reveals that Omar has paid him to detain both Paul and Beth. Paul disarms one of the thugs, kills everyone in the room but Beth, and shoots his way to safety. Back at Sam's penthouse suite, the two reminisce about their exploits while waiting for an assault from Omar. Omar's men capture Beth, and Paul leaves to rescue her. At Omar's business, Paul defeats several waves of henchmen before facing Omar himself. Omar demands to know why Paul murdered his family and threatens to kill Beth in retaliation. Paul says that they were simply collateral damage and offers to let Omar live if he gives up Beth. Mark, Omar's bodyguard and adviser, engages Paul in hand-to-hand combat; the two seem evenly matched, but Paul finds a gun and kills Mark. Beth elbows Omar in the ribs and escapes from his grasp, freeing her father to take a shot and kill Omar. Beth and her father are reunited again. Angela embraces them both outside the building, and the three leave together.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wirral, North, the archdeaconry of Chester, and the diocese of Chester. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Christ Church was built between 1857 and 1859, and designed by Walter Scott. The foundation stone was laid on 1 August 1857, and the church was consecrated by the Rt Revd John Graham, bishop of Chester on 24 December 1859. The steeple was added in 1884–85, but the tip of the spire was lost in 1980. Architecture Exterior The church is constructed in sandstone from Storeton quarry, and has slate roofs. Its architectural style is that of the 13th century. The plan consists of a seven- bay nave with a clerestory, north and south six-bay aisles under lean-to roofs, a chancel, a north vestry, a north organ loft, and a northwest steeple. The windows along the sides of the aisles are paired lancets, and there is a three-light window in the southwest of the nave. In the clerestory are three- light windows with trefoil heads. The west window of the nave has four lights containing Geometric tracery; this is flanked by lancet windows. Below the window is a gabled entrance. The chancel has a four-light east window, the vestry has a three-light west window with plate tracery and three trefoil- headed east windows, and the organ loft has three lancets with a spherical triangle window above. The tower has angle buttresses, a west entrance, and a north two-light window with plate tracery. The bell openings are louvred with trefoil heads. The tower is surmounted by a shingled broach spire. Set into the wall of the porch is a stone bearing the fossilized footprint of a Chirotherium, an archosaur. Interior Inside the church the six-bay arcades are carried on alternate round and octagonal piers. The columns for these are monoliths. The roofs are scissor-braced, that of the chancel being carried on corbels carved with angels. The chancel screen dates from 1912, and is carved with tracery and motifs including cherubs and vines. The pulpit is in stone, and is carved with tracery, arched panels, and buttresses. There are blind arcades on the east chancel wall, and on the reredos. The font is carried on shafts with angel corbels, and has panels carved with symbols. The stained glass in the west window dates from 1862 and is by R. B. Edmundson. A companion window to this was at the east end, but this was lost in Second World War, and has been replaced by a window of 1951 depicting the Nativity, designed by T. F. Wilford of Marple Bridge. On the south side of the chancel is a window of 1905 by C. E. Kempe, and on the north side is one of 1961 by A. V. Holloway. The windows in the north aisle date from between 1927 and 1937, and were made by Morris & Co. The three-manual pipe organ was made in 1936 by Rushworth and Dreaper.

Geography The village is located about 3 miles north of the old town of Dassel in a rural area, right east of Amtsberge. History Today's village is located on a site where in the Middle Ages a village named Binder was located. A deed of 1360 cites ownership rights, that the Imperial Abbey of Corvey sold by then to the counts of Pyrmont. This village was destroyed in the Thirty Years' War. After that war, the bishop of the diocese of Hildesheim had new administration buildings built right there. The new name Hunnesrück was adopted from the neighboring Hunnesrück Castle which had been destroyed in the 1520s. Several buildings made up the site including a watermill that is still in place and a chapel that was demolished in 1847. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Westphalia in that region however, the buildings lost their function because the new administrators operated in a building in Einbeck instead. From 1866 on the Prussian Army used the buildings for their cavalry until it was dissolved in 1919. Nonetheless Hunnesrück remained a stud farm until today. It is a subsidiary of Celle State Stud. Owner is the German state Lower Saxony. Hanoverian colts are held there. In the 20th century though, Trakehner and Przewalski's horses were held there as well.

Background To create stereoscopic depth illusion in movie or photography, two slightly different images have to be viewed at the same time, each of them presented to one eye. In order to capture moving objects, the images have to be taken in exactly the same moment. Therefore, it is necessary to shoot with two cameras that are in sync. In addition to that the cameras have to be geometrically aligned accurately, to minimize the amount of stereoscopic errors. A 3D Rig, as a result, must provide the possibility to mount two cameras, with a horizontal offset and adjust the cameras in all possible axes.Editor: Max Hemmo, 2012. s3D NOW! - A Stereoscopic Experiment for Film and TV. 1 Edition. Fachverlag Schiele & Schoen GmbH. p. 218 For 3D moviemaking, it is also necessary that the horizontal distance between the cameras can be adjusted via remote control while shooting. It is important that the rigs have a high stability. This is to assure that they do not deform during movement, for example on a crane. Otherwise this could impact or destroy the camera alignment. In general there are two types of 3D Rigs, side-by-side rigs and mirror rigs.Editor: Max Hemmo, 2012. s3D NOW! - A Stereoscopic Experiment for Film and TV. 1 Edition. Fachverlag Schiele & Schoen GmbH. p. 219 Side by Side Rig Set-up The least complex way to take pictures or shoot film in 3D is having two cameras mounted side-by-side. They are aligned parallel to each other, or can be angulated so that their optical axes meet at a chosen distance. In some systems the cameras are fixed to the rig body and can not be moved. More professional side-by-side-rigs, however, offer the possibility to change the interaxial distance easily. When to use A side-by-side rig is a proper way to do wide shots like landscape or overviews in sport broadcasting, however they cannot be used for close-ups since the minimum distance between the cameras is limited to the size of the lenses. Advantages Side-by- side rigs are comparably easy to build and therefore cheap.Bernard Mendiburu, 2009. 3D Movie Making: Stereoscopic Digital Cinema from Script to Screen. 1 Edition. Focal Press. p. 198. They also often provide bigger possible interaxial distances then mirror rigs, which can be used to create a miniaturization effect. Disadvantages Side-by-side rigs cannot be used for close-ups since the minimum distance between the cameras is limited to the size of the lenses. For close-up shots though it is necessary to have smaller interaxial distances. For most shooting situations in live action film therefore mirror rigs are used. Mirror Rig  Schematic illustration of a beam splitter. Set-up In a mirror rig the two cameras look through a beamsplitter. One camera sees right through it. The other one captures the reflected image. One camera is placed above or below the other one at a ninety-degree angle.http://www.3dfocus.co.uk/3d-glossary In some rigs only one camera can be moved. This can throw the system's weight out of balance, which can cause problems when used on a camera stabilization mount (e.g. Steadicam). Others offer the possibility to move both cameras simultaneously. When to use The mirror rig is the one to choose for shooting live action film. “It makes the best 3D pictures, and some stereographers would say ‘the only good 3D pictures’”.Bernard Mendiburu, 2009. 3D Movie Making: Stereoscopic Digital Cinema from Script to Screen. 1 Edition. Focal Press. p. 199 Because the cameras in this set-up aren’t physically in their way, the distance between the optical axes of the cameras can be smaller than the size of the lenses and even down to zero. Shots with small interaxial distances are possible, which is necessary for shooting in a classical movie style with close-up and detail shots. Advantages Mirror rigs make telling stories with classical tools of film narration possible. For close-ups, two shots, details and most dialogue scenes, the interaxial distance has to be not more than a couple of millimeters. This is only possible with a mirror rig. To simply zoom in or use long lenses to get close-up shots with a side-by-side rig leads to a bad roundness.http://danielesiragusano.wordpress.com/ Another advantage is, that the images can be used for the geometrical alignment of the cameras since stereoscopic errors can be seen most easily when the interaxial distance is zero. Disadvantages With the mirror there is one more optical element that has to be handled and manufactured carefully, which makes these rigs usually more expensive than side-by-side rigs. \\"The use of mirrors makes it sensitive to dust and fast accelerations. The mirror needs to be big enough to accommodate wide angles. It requires accurate mirror placement toward the cameras; otherwise keystone artifacts will affect the images.\\" The mirror itself also takes away one f-stopBernard Mendiburu, 2009. 3D Movie Making: Stereoscopic Digital Cinema from Script to Screen. 1 Edition. Focal Press. p. 106-107. since the light is split up for the two cameras. Mirrors of bad quality can produce a color mismatch that has to be corrected in postproduction. In addition to that every mirror filters the light according to its polarization. This leads to brightness differences between the two images especially at reflections and transparent objects.

Spence was the first enlisted man to be recruited into a clandestine group, operated by General William \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which would become known as the frogmen. The group was a predecessor of the present-day United States Navy SEALs. The origin of the term \\"frogman\\" can be traced directly to John Spence. In an interview with maritime historian Erick Simmel, Spence explained that frogman first came into use while he was training in a green, waterproof suit. Spence recalled, \\"Someone saw me surfacing one day and yelled out, 'Hey, frogman!' The name stuck for all of us.\\" Spence and the other men trained in underwater close combat techniques, demolition and stealth in order to destroy underwater emplacements and enemy ships during World War II. Spence trained under a medical student, Dr. Christian Lambertsen, who developed the United States Navy frogmen's rebreathers for underwater warfare. Spence was initially sent to the United Kingdom after training. His original mission was to attack a German submarine base in France. However, Spence's original mission was cancelled for fear that the attack on the submarine base might accidentally alert Nazi Germany to the impending D-Day invasion of Normandy. Instead, Spence and several British commandos were secretly sent to France several times to rescue stranded airmen and meet with the French Resistance. He was next sent to the Bahamas, where he trained combat swimmers to prepare for fighting against Japan in the Pacific Theater. Spence was soon deployed to the Pacific, where he served on the USS Wadsworth (DD-516). He manned a forward gun battery during the Battle of Iwo Jima in an effort to provide cover for U.S. combat swimmers. He also helmed the gun battery against kamikaze pilots during the long Battle of Okinawa in 1945. Spence was unable to tell friends and family of his role in the frogmen until the late 1980s, when files on the group were finally declassified. Spence remained with the United States Navy until his retirement in 1961. He worked as a systems testing engineer at the Lockheed Corporation after leaving the Navy. He lived in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles and later resided in Oroville, California. He moved to Bend, Oregon, after the death of his first wife in the 2000s. John Spence died at an elderly care facility in Bend, Oregon, on October 29, 2013, at the age of 95. He was survived by four daughters - Genevieve Ross, Yvonne Romano, Margo Kirkwood and Sharon Ogden.

Biographical details at The Netherlands Institute for Art History Biography Nothing is known about his background and training. He was in Rome from 1620, and maybe as early as 1617. He was one of the co-founders in 1623 of the Bentvueghels, which was set up as a social club of principally Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome.

He is known for a significant work on the chemistry of mineral springs, and as an editor of alchemical tracts. Life Deane was born in Saltonstall, Halifax, West Yorkshire, and was a brother of Richard Deane, the bishop of Ossory. His parents were Gilbert Deane of Saltonstall and Elizabeth, daughter of Edmund Jennings of Seilsden in Craven, and the family consisted of four sons, (Gilbert, Richard, Edmund and his twin Symon, who died at age seven). Edmund Deane was baptised on 23 March 1572; his mother's funeral was two days' later. Deane studied at Merton College, matriculating there in 1591 and graduating B.A. in 1594, and M.A. in 1597. He was licensed as a physician in 1601, and graduated M.B. and M.D. in 1608, having studied also at St Alban's Hall, Oxford. He then returned north to York and practised medicine. William Camidge wrote in Ye Olde Streete of Pavement (1893) that Deane occupied a house adjoining the residence of Laurence Rawden in the street called Pavement. He died in 1640, and was buried in St Crux Church, York. His will was dated 30 October 1639, and was proved at York on 14 April 1640. Spadacrene Anglica (1626) Deane published: Spadacrene Anglica, or the English Spa Fountain (1626). This work on the spring waters at Harrogate was connected with Deane's relatively short acquaintance with Timothie Bright (Bright died in 1615, Deane moved back to York in 1614). The local spring waters were sulphurous, and were recommended by a number of medical men: Bright, Deane, then Michael Stanhope, and John French. The Tewit Well, Harrogate, today The development of the Tewit Well by William Slingsby (died 1608) from 1571 had led to a wish to promote the \\"English Spaw\\" as Bright, rector of Barwick-in-Elmet and Methley, named it in the mid-1590s. Yorkshire gentry favoured the idea, and in 1625 Deane and Stanhope visited the well, cleaned it out, and took samples. Deane put the argument that taking the waters in England was safer than travel to continental Europe to do so. Chemical testing of the waters was described in Spadacrene Anglica, and Stanhope's later work, based in particular on the \\"gall test\\" going back to Conrad Gesner. These are early mentions of this chemical indicator in the English literature: Gesner's ideas had been translated by Thomas Hill in his Newe Jewell of 1576, but little intervening interest was shown. The tradition of chemical analysis was continued by French and Robert Witty (1660), and was praised by Samuel Hartlib. Deane mentioned four other wells around Harrogate. He also showed he was aware of the popular St Mungo's Well at Copgrove, and St Robert's Well at Knaresborough. Stanhope in his 1626 work Newes out of Yorkshire described Harrogate waters, and in 1631 he discovered another spring there, which became known as St John's Well. Alchemy Ramist tincture tree of physics and alchemy, illustration from Catholicon Physicorum (1630), by Samuel Norton and Edmund Deane Deane also produced an edition of Samuel Norton's Latin writings (1630), published in Frankfurt. Family Edmund Deane married twice, first to Anne, widow of Marmaduke Haddersley of Hull; the date is not known, though it was before the entry of pedigree was recorded in 1612. In 1625, he had a license at York to marry Mary Bowes of Normanton at Normanton. There does not appear to have been a family by either of his wives.

This is one of the Iqbal's most famous lengthy poems apart from Tulu'-e-Islaam, Shikwah and Jawab-e-Shikwah. This poem was published in his book, Baal-e-Jibreel, often translated in English as Gabriel's Wing.  Theme of the Poem  The central theme of the poem is Muslim Renaissance. Iqbal sketches changing order of the world's political system and laments that Islamic Nations are still devoid of that awakening. He prays to Almighty Allah to bestow Muslims with wisdom and awareness. The word saqi is translated in English as a bartender. The word has been extensively used as a metaphor in Urdu poetry for lover, friends, poet's alter ego and even for Almighty God. Iqbal has used the word saqi a poetic reference to Allah. Structure of the poem The poem is divided in seven stanzas and gradually proceeds to its central theme that actually occurs in stanza three. Each stanza has twelve ashaa’r (couplet). In the first stanza Iqbal has narrated the exultation of nature on the arrival of a new world order, although, the cause of exultation has not been indicated. He has used the entities of living worlds (such as flowers and birds) and physical worlds (mountains and rivers) to bring out the energy of this changing world order. Iqbal opens the poem by welcoming bahaar the season of spring. After having described the jocundity of natural elements during springs, Iqbal addresses Saqi, admitting that the spring is a timely event and will go soon. He pleads Saqi to bestow the knowledge of spirituality and ethereal wisdom on him – the knowledge that has been referred as mae (wine). In the second stanza Iqbal narrates the changing world order. He acknowledges that how political structure in politically, philosophically and scientifically developed Europe is heading from monarchy to democracy and how the social order based on capitalism is being challenged. Iqbal hints how countries like and India and China are emerging as a nation developing their own social structure. Finally, Iqbal comes to Islamic nations and criticises them for lack of their zeal to reinvent calling them as dead ashes. In the following stanzas (third to seventh), Iqbal makes as strong appeal to his Saqi to incite the Islamic nations with zeal to reinvent themselves.

She is the co-founder and CEO/CSO of the immunoinformatics company EpiVax. Prior to EpiVax, she was a professor at Brown University, where she established the TB/HIV Research Lab. The laboratory attracted a range of intelligent and creative Brown University undergraduate and graduate students (Bill Jesdale, Gabriel Meister, Tamar Renaud, Jessica Stevens, and many others) who worked with De Groot on projects ranging from improving healthcare for inmates living in correctional facilities in the United States, improving access to care in West Africa, and developing cutting edge tools for analyzing protein sequences and designing vaccines. While at Brown University, De Groot worked with Gabriel Meister and Bill Jesdale to develop the EpiMer and EpiMatrix epitope mapping tools. These were among the first motif-based and matrix-based, fully automated T cell epitope mapping tools. The team applied these tools to HIV vaccine design, and were soon travelling to HIV Vaccine conferences as a group to demonstrate how the tools could be used to help design vaccines that would be effective against a range of HIV strains (see GAIA Vaccine, and GAIA Vaccine Foundation). Additional tools were developed that automated genome sequence analysis for highly conserved, immungenic epitopes, starting from any protein sequence. Having successfully collaborated with a range of institutions, including University of Pennsylvania, Hopkins University, Harvard University, and the CDC, De Groot, working with then-consultant Bill Martin, decided to establish a commercial company to make these tools available to a wider audience. EpiVax was founded with an initial grant from the Slater Biotechnology Foundation (in 1998). During the 1998-2008 period, EpiVax became a well known for innovative, collaborative research in computational vaccinology and immunoinformatics. De Groot was invited to establish a new Institute at the University of Rhode Island in 2008. She currently directs the Institute for Immunology and Informatics at the University of Rhode Island, the GAIA Vaccine Foundation and the Clinica Esperanza (Hope Clinic). She currently teaches a vaccine course at the University of Rhode Island downtown campus, and her laboratory does research on 'immune camouflage'.  Education  Dr. Anne De Groot graduated from Smith College in 1978 with a BA and from the Pritzker School of Medicine at University of Chicago in 1983 with an MD. She completed her residency in internal medicine at Tufts New England Medical Center and then trained in Parasitology and Vaccine Research at the NIH and in Infectious Disease at the Tufts New England Medical Center. De Groot is board certified in Internal Medicine and Infectious Disease. She is the volunteer Medical Director and currently practices Internal Medicine at the Clinica Esperanza (Hope Clinic), a free clinic for Rhode Island residents who do not have health insurance.  Career  Annie De Groot and Bill Martin (COO/CIO EpiVax) founded EpiVax in 1998 to use bioinformatics to design epitope-driven vaccines and expanded to offer immunogenicity screening services for protein therapeutics. De Groot, Martin and Dr. Leonard Moise discovered regulatory T cell epitopes, called “Tregitopes”, that are shown to activate regulatory T cells and suppress the immune response. De Groot, Martin and Moise also developed the JanusMatrix tool, that identifies regions of \\"immune camouflage\\" used by pathogens to escape immune response. Between 1992 and 2008 De Groot also contributed to the Yale HIV in Prison program and Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Framingham, providing medical treatment to inmates, founded the GAIA Vaccine Foundation for improving global AIDS treatment, and founded a free clinic in Rhode Island, Clinica Esperanza. Her current work at the Clinica Esperanza includes the nurse-run CHEER Clinic, a walk in clinic pilot program that serves as an alternative to non-urgent ER visits. Clinica Esperanza Clinica Esperanza (Hope Clinic) is a volunteer-run free clinic for uninsured adults located in the Olneyville neighborhood of Providence, RI.

It is the only bridge in Western Australia to have spanned both a waterway and railway, the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment. The mainly timber bridge has a unique curved and sloped design, due to the difficult topography and the route of the former railway. The bridge was designed in 1934 to replace two dangerous rail crossings and a rudimentary water crossing. Construction began in January 1935, and was completed relatively quickly, with the opening ceremony held in August 1935. The bridge has undergone various improvement and maintenance works since then, including widening by in 1959–60, but remained a safety hazard, with increasing severity and numbers of accidents through the 1970s and 1980s. Planning for a highway bypass of Clackline and the Clackline Bridge began in the 1990s, and it was constructed between January 2007 and February 2008. The local community had been concerned that the historic bridge would be lost, but it remains in use as part of the local road network, and has been listed on both the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory and the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places. Description Clackline Bridge is a timber bridge spanning the Clackline Brook and the former Eastern Railway alignment, in the Shire of Northam, east of Perth. Constrained by the topography of the site, the route of the Eastern Railway tracks, and the previous alignment of Great Eastern Highway, the bridge has a unique curved and sloping design. It has 18 spans over a length, with a 1 in 20 slope and a horizontal curve radius of . There are 18 numbered piers, starting from pier 1 at the eastern end. The double tracks of the Eastern Railway, which linked Perth and Northam until its removal in 1981, passed between piers 16 and 17. Piers 14 to 17 are parallel to that former railway, at an angle of approximately 40 degrees to the bridge. This resulted in spans of various lengths: heading out from the western abutment, then a span between piers 16 and 17, followed by a length, two spans, and 13 spans of . View of Clackline Bridge from below, showing the structure of the bridge and piers The bridge has undergone multiple alterations, but the original piers remain. They were constructed as \\"four rounded braced wandoo piles supported from horizontal 450mm timber sills, adzed to 400mm, fixed to concrete footings\\", with the footings designed to bear on foundation rocks beneath the surface. The bridge's original spans were made up of seven rounded timber wandoo stringers, of at least diameter, bearing on jarrah corbels, supported by jarrah half caps in size. The span over the railway alignment was originally supported on four steel beams, weighing each. Various aspects of Clackline Bridge have since been modified. Originally wide, with a footpath, the bridge was widened by , with two additional piles installed at each pier. At the same time the railway span was strengthened, with eight additional steel beams installed, and steel plates welded to the flanges of the existing girders. The approaches to the bridge were also widened, over a length of to the west, and to the east. The timber decking was upgraded to a concrete slab that has been repaired a number of times, especially around pier 13. Some of the connecting bolts in the structure have been replaced, and a concrete approach slab was installed at the western end. In 2008, the bridge was assessed as being in a well- maintained condition. Main Roads Western Australia identifies Clackline Bridge as Structure Number 0608\\\\. , the bridge dimensions are recorded as in length and in width, with a distance of between kerbs, a deck area of , and maximum span length of . , it is the only bridge in Western Australia to have crossed both a railway line and a waterway. History The settlement of Clackline began as a stopping point on the Spencers Brook to Northam section of the Eastern Railway line, which opened on 13 October 1886. It was also the point where the road to Newcastle (now Toodyay) departed the Perth to Kalgoorlie road. Both the road and railway crossed the adjacent Clackline Brook. In 1926, the newly formed Main Roads Department's Engineer for Roads and Bridges, A. Fotheringham, described the majority of the Wooroloo to Clackline road as \\"simply a bush track widened out from time to time by the traffic\\". The road crossed the railway line twice, and Clackline Brook via a small bedlog bridge, in the vicinity of the town, but the rail crossings were \\"awkwardly and dangerously situated in regard to road traffic, owing to limited visibility\\", and the water crossing was described in 1935 as \\"a primitive and inadequate culvert\\". A car crosses the railway bridge to avoid the flooded road Though the need to improve this section of road was recognised in 1926, funding was limited. Only part of the required improvement work was undertaken, and included rerouting the highway along Lockyer Road, resuming several town lots, and resurfacing the road, at a cost of £8000. In March 1934, torrential rain caused widespread flooding in the Wheatbelt, affecting Northam, Toodyay, York, Beverley, and surrounding areas. Rail services were disrupted, and main roads were cut off at many points, including at Clackline. Some cars managed to bypass the flooded road by driving along the railway line, but such practice was described by the Royal Automobile Club as \\"highly dangerous\\" and \\"against the railway regulations\\". The Main Roads Department had been considering completing the remaining improvements in November 1933, but the flooding made the situation more urgent. It prompted Albert Hawke, MLA for Northam, to write to the Commissioner for Main Roads, E. W. Tindale, urging that the Clackline works commence, especially since works at nearby Northam had almost been finished. Design and construction Clackline Bridge allowed the main road to avoid two railway crossings and dangerous curves, as shown in this map from 1935. Main Roads engineer Ernest Godfrey completed a design for the Clackline Deviation, a single bridge over the waterway and railway, in August 1934. Godfrey was the first bridge engineer for Main Roads, and is credited with introducing concrete and steel bridges into Western Australia; however, for Clackline Bridge, he proposed using timber – the standard material for the preceding hundred years – with steel construction only for the longer span over the railway. He also suggested that a footpath be included on the bridge, so that schoolchildren and other pedestrians would have a safer railway crossing. The cost was estimated at £8500, plus an additional £700 for the footpath. The initial design was moved south, to satisfy the Railways Department's requirement that the route not be too close to the Toodyay railway line (a spur line off the Eastern Railway) that ran parallel to the highway. This shift increased the curve radius, but required \\"the destruction of some well developed pine trees inside the old boundary fence of the [Clackline School] playground\\". Construction was undertaken by Main Roads Department day labourers, starting in January 1935, as part of an unemployment relief works program. The Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) was involved in various aspects of the project – some railway land acquisition was required, and WAGR supplied and supervised a five-ton crane, used to erect the railway span girders. The bridge was completed less than one year after construction began, which would later be described as \\"a considerable achievement of the management and workforce for such a complex structure\\". Clackline Bridge was opened on 30 August 1935 by Acting Minister for Works H. Millington, having cost £9000. The first vehicle to cross the bridge was Millington's car, carrying himself and Albert Hawke on the front bumper, and a small boy who decided to take a ride on the rear bumper. Afterwards, there was an official lunchtime party in Northam, hosted by the Northam Roads Board. Safety concerns and upgrades Within two decades the bridge was considered a safety hazard, due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected either side of the railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately £20,000. Clackline Bridge continued to be a safety concern, with several accidents occurring in the 1970s. The narrow road and small curve radius were considered major factors in the accidents, and there was roughness in the road surface between the original and widened sections. A reinforced concrete overlay was installed on the bridge in 1978, initially with a single coat surface, but then upgraded to a bituminous concrete surface in 1987. The 1980s saw the closure and removal of the Perth–Northam railway line, as well a number of major and sometimes fatal accidents involving prime movers. There were also several car accidents, and the \\"screaming brakes of cars and hiss of airbrakes\\" were often heard at night in Clackline. After each accident, damaged sections of the bridge – usually the guardrails, handrails, or bridge entry section – needed to be repaired. A 1989 prime mover accident severely damaged the footpath. Rather than repair the narrow footpath, and given that the railway had been removed, a new pedestrian path was constructed on the ground below the bridge. A bushfire burnt through the area in December 1993, destroying the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier 13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, as part of the local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road. Replacement Clackline Bridge, with the Great Eastern Highway bypass on the left In the wake of the accidents of the 1970s and 1980s, replacement of Clackline Bridge seemed inevitable; however, both Main Roads and the Shire of Northam received letters from residents asking for the bridge to be kept. In 1988, the Shire requested that Main Roads note the preservation value of the bridge, and retain it in any plans for road realignment. A decade later, in 1998, the bridge was placed on the Northam Municipal Heritage Inventory, in category C – \\"conserve if possible\\". In that same year, it was included in an Institute of Engineers survey of the state's large timber structures, as a current structure with \\"very high heritage value\\". By this time Great Eastern Highway's bypass of Clackline was being planned, but maintenance works continued to be undertaken as needed. The bypass was eventually constructed, with works beginning in January 2007, and the project completed in February 2008. The Clackline community welcomed the bypass, but there were still concerns that the historic Clackline Bridge would be lost. The bridge has since received a permanent entry on the Heritage Council of Western Australia's Register of Heritage Places, in November 2008. The new highway alignment crosses Clackline Brook on a large box culvert, giving vehicles a safer crossing than Clackline Bridge.

These include: *A new written constitution, which would retain the British monarch as Head of State in a personal union *Scotland would keep the pound as part of a currency union with the UK, and take on a portion of the UK's national debt *Removal of Trident nuclear weapons from Scotland within the first parliament *Employment legislation to help increase the female workforce, and 30 hours per week childcare for pre-school children *Creation of a 15,000 strong Scottish Defence Force, with a further 5,000 reservists, and a new national intelligence agency *Britons born and/or living in Scotland entitled to Scottish citizenship and Scottish passport *Abolition of housing benefit reforms introduced by the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and reversal of plans to introduce Universal Credit *Basic rate tax allowance, tax credit and minimum wage to rise in line with inflation *A state pension of £160 from April 2016, and review of UK government plans to raise the retirement age *Replace BBC Scotland with a Scottish Broadcasting Service (SBS) from 2017, but continue close ties with the BBC, including airing content such as Doctor Who and EastEnders. The Scottish Broadcasting Service would also try to join the European Broadcasting Union and therefore be able to compete in the Eurovision Song Contest. *Renationalisation of the Royal Mail The document also contains a 200-page section covering 650 questions on issues relating to independence.  Response  The launch of the document was welcomed in principle by Yes Scotland chairman Dennis Canavan and chief executive Blair Jenkins, and also by Radical Independence Campaign co-founder Jonathon Shafi. Scottish National Party (SNP) Member of Parliament (MP) Angus Robertson welcomed its defence commitments. MSP Joan McAlpine said that it made the United States Declaration of Independence \\"look like a Post-it note\\". Pat Rafferty, Scottish secretary of trade union Unite, said the document offers \\"some welcome proposals\\", and that the union \\"[notes] with interest proposals for the establishment of a National Convention on Employment and Labour Relations which we hope reflects a long-term desire for a more pluralistic approach to employment relations from the Scottish government\\". However, he also said Unite will \\"[pursue] more detail on proposals for wider trade union-related legislation and the role of collective bargaining in re- balancing the future Scottish economy\\". It was criticised by a number of politicians and commentators. Alistair Darling, chairman of Better Together, called it \\"a work of fiction\\" and \\"a wish-list of political promises\\". It was styled as \\"a compendium of existing assertions and a glossary of uncosted policies\\" by Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie. Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont dismissed the document as \\"670 pages of assertion and uncertainty\\". Alex Massie suggested in a blog for The Spectator that its release was \\"designed to shift the Overton Window\\", and that \\"its publication nudges the argument forward and makes the idea of independence seem more real, more routine, than it was yesterday\\". Alison Rowat of The Herald called it \\"hopelessly dated in its view of women\\" and criticised the universal childcare pledge, pointing out that the Scottish Parliament already has the legislative capability to introduce the policy: \\"In pushing childcare as a game-changing idea, those behind the launch of Scotland's Future show zero appreciation of the basic political tactic of never promising anything you can already deliver.\\" Conversely, an editorial in the Sunday Herald said that \\"every woman in Scotland should welcome the commitment\\". Bright Green published an infographic explaining why the policy was not feasible under devolution. On 7 December 2013, a discussion forum facilitated by the Scottish Socialist Voice invited figures from the pro-independence left to respond to the document. The forum was chaired by John Finnie and featured Jim Sillars, John McAllion, Isobel Lindsay, Prof Mike Danson, Maggie Chapman, and Colin Fox on its panel. McAllion expressed concern over a lack of detail on the proposed \\"constitutional convention\\" that would write an independent Scotland's constitution, adding criticism of the Scottish Constitutional Convention that created the blueprint for Scottish devolution.

All were students or otherwise involved in the radical student movement of the times at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. The collective expanded through the 1970s to involve over 20 people, and expanding its operations throughout northern Illinois, Wisconsin, and eastern Minnesota.  Services  WIND distributed left-wing and progressive materials of all kinds, from music to drug publications to focused left-wing periodicals, which were delivered by truck route to a broad assemblage of retail stores. Retail resellers included head shops, which catered to the youth culture, food cooperatives, music stores, and regular periodical retail operations. Notable among the material it distributed was TakeOver, a Madison-based underground newspaper. WIND was also among the first select groups to distribute Prairie Fire, the manifesto of the Weather Underground. In years subsequent to the operation of WIND as a political collective, it was learned the organization had been under routine surveillance by law enforcement agencies.  Transition to comic book distributor  WIND enjoyed a multi-year run in its original incarnation until a waning of left-wing political activity brought change to the general culture. Ultimately the politically oriented organization devolved into a more mainstream product distributor focused on mainstream comic books. Initially absorbed by a counterpart organization, the Detroit-based Big Rapids Distribution, which went bankrupt in 1980, its surviving elements provided a starting point for Capital City Distribution, a large comic book distributor operated for many years by two late-arriving members of the original WIND collective, Milton Griepp and John Davis.\\"Who We Are: Milton Griepp,\\" ICv2.com.

Opposition politicians in Serbia used this case to illustrate the censorship in Serbia. Journalist surveillance case  In February 2020 Serbia's Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin commented on an article in Nedeljnik that had never been published by the newspaper, or anyone else. Author of the opinion piece in question was opposition politician Dragan Sutanovac, who asked the editor-in-chief Veljko Lalic if Nedeljnik would publish his column in a part of the weekly where public figures express their views.http://rs.n1info.com/English/NEWS/a570016/Serbia-s-Defence-Minister- comments-on-unpublished-article-Ministry-appologises.html \\"Sutanovac sent the column on Monday, and Lalic told him on Tuesday afternoon that the weekly wouldn't publish it. It hasn't been either published in the print issue nor has it been posted on the website. It remained in Sutanovac's and Lalic's e-mails and in the correspondence with the other editor Marko Prelevic whom Lalic sent the article. After that, Sutanovac said he would offer the article to other media. And that will be all as far as we are concerned,\\" Nedeljnik said in the statement. Later, the Defence Ministry apologised, blaming its PR, which said the article was published by Nedeljnik instead of the Kurir tabloid. Nevertheless, it added, \\"all the Minister said was true.\\" Sutanovac said that in interview for Kurir he didn't say anything regarding the issues Vulin commented in his statement, so it was obvious that article in Nedeljnik he had in mind. \\"The debate with the unpublished article undoubtedly confirms that Vulin has illegally obtained the e-mails exchange between the Nedeljnik's editor and me. Is Serbia becoming the country of 'Big Brother' in which the state resources are used to intercept the communication between the former Defence Minister and media editor, is now doubtless.\\" Reporters Without Borders (RSF) urged the Serbian authorities to investigate the possibility that the government had spied on and intercepted emails between an opposition politician and Nedeljnik.https://rsf.org/en/news/serbia-must-account-alleged- surveillance-journalists-emails COVID-19 coverage Nedeljnik magazine, doctor superheroes During the coronavirus crisis in early spring of 2020, Nedeljnik published a series of special issues on global and local influence of the new pandemic.

It is the first of two novels about the Todd family. The second, A God in Ruins, was published in 2015. Life After Life garnered acclaim from critics. Plot The novel has an unusual structure, repeatedly looping back in time to describe alternative possible lives for its central character, Ursula Todd, who is born on 11 February 1910 to an upper-middle-class family near Chalfont St Peter in Buckinghamshire. In the first version, she is strangled by her umbilical cord and stillborn. In later iterations of her life she dies as a child - drowning in the sea, or when saved from that, by falling to her death from the roof when trying to retrieve a fallen doll. Then there are several sequences when she falls victim to the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 - which repeats itself again and again, though she already has a foreknowledge of it, and only her fourth attempt to avert catching the flu succeeds. Then there is an unhappy life where she is traumatized by being raped, getting pregnant and undergoing an illegal abortion, and finally becoming trapped in a highly oppressive marriage, and being killed by her abusive husband when trying to escape. In later lives she averts all this by being preemptively aggressive to the would- be rapist. In between, she also uses her half-memory of earlier lives to avert the neighbour girl Nancy being raped and murdered by a child molester. The saved Nancy would have an important role in Ursula's later life(s), forming a deep love relationship with Ursula's brother Teddy, and would become a main character in the sequel, A God in Ruins. Still later iterations of Ursula's life take her into World War Two, where she works in London for the War Office and repeatedly witnesses the results of the Blitz including a direct hit on a bomb shelter in Argyll Road in November 1940 - with herself being among the victims in some lives and among the rescuers in others. There is also a life in which she marries a German in 1934, is unable to return to England and experiences the war in Berlin under the allied bombings. Ursula eventually comes to realize, through a particularly strong sense of deja vu, that she has lived before, and decides to try to prevent the war by killing Adolf Hitler in late 1930. Memory of her earlier lives also provides the means of doing that: the knowledge that by befriending Eva Braun - in 1930 an obscure shop girl in Munich - Ursula would be able to get close to Hitler with a loaded gun in her bag; the inevitable price, however, is to be herself shot to death by Hitler's Nazi followers immediately after killing him. What is left unclear - since each of the time sequences end with \\"darkness\\" and Ursula's death and does not show what followed - is whether in fact all these lives actually occurred in an objective world, or were only subjectively experienced by her. Specifically, whether or not her killing Hitler in 1930 actually produced an altered timeline where the Nazis did not take power in Germany, or possibly took power under a different leader with a different course of the Second World War. Though in her 1967 incarnation Ursula speculates with her nephew on this \\"might have been\\", the book avoids giving a clear answer. Critical reaction Alex Clark of The Guardian gave Life After Life a positive review, saying that domestic details of daily life are conveyed beautifully, and that traumatic shifts in British society are also captured well \\"precisely because she cuts directly from one war to the next, only later going back to fill in, partially, what happened in between.\\" Clark argued that the novel \\"[co-opts] the family [...] and [uses] it to show how fiction works and what it might mean to us [...] with an emotional delicacy and understanding that transcend experiment or playfulness. Life After Life gives us a heroine whose fictional underpinning is permanently exposed, whose artificial status is never in doubt; and yet one who feels painfully, horribly real to us.\\" The Daily Telegraph's Helen Brown likewise praised it, calling it Atkinson's best book to date. The Independent found the central character to be sympathetic, and argued that the book's central message was that World War II was preventable and should not have been allowed to happen. Janet Maslin of The New York Times Book Review praised Life After Life as Atkinson's \\"very best\\" book and \\"full of mind games, but they are purposeful rather than emptily playful. [...] this one connects its loose ends with facile but welcome clarity.\\" She described it as having an \\"engaging cast of characters\\" and called the depiction of the British experience of World War II \\"gutsy and deeply disturbing, just as the author intends it to be.\\" Francine Prose of The New York Times wrote that Atkinson \\"nimbly succeeds in keeping the novel from becoming confusing\\" and argued that the work \\"makes the reader acutely conscious of an author’s power: how much the novelist can do.\\" The Wall Street Journal's Sam Sacks dubbed Life After Life a \\"formidable bid\\" for the Man Booker Prize (though the novel was ultimately not longlisted). He said the high-concept premise of \\"Ursula [contriving] to avoid the accident that previously killed her [...] blends uneasily with what is otherwise a deft and convincing portrayal of an English family's evolution across two world wars [...] all the other characters seem complexly armed with free will.\\" He found the resolution related to the prologue as \\"rushed and anticlimactic\\". But Sacks also said that \\"she [brings] characters to life with enviable ease\\", referring to the erosion of Sylvie and Hugh's marriage as \\"poignantly charted\\". Also, like Maslin, he lauded the novella-length Blitz chapter as \\"gorgeous and nerve-racking\\". In NPR, novelist Meg Wolitzer suggested that the book proves that \\"a fully-realized world\\" is more important to the success of a fiction work than the progression of its story, and dubbed it a \\"major, serious yet playfully experimental novel\\". She argued that by not choosing one path for Ursula, Atkinson \\"opened her novel outward, letting it breathe unrestricted\\". The Guardian's Sam Jordison expressed mixed feelings. He commended the depiction of Ursula and her family, and Atkinson's \\"fine storytelling and sharp eye for domestic detail\\". He argued, \\"There is real playfulness in these revisited moments and repetition never breeds dullness. Instead, we try to spot the differences and look for refractions of the same scene, considering the permutations of what is said and done. It can provide an enjoyable and interactive experience.\\" He criticized the portions outside of Britain, however, and said overall that the book has \\"an abundance of human warmth, but it just isn't convincing. There is much to enjoy – but not quite enough to admire.\\" In 2019, Life After Life was ranked by The Guardian as the 20th best book since 2000. It was written that the \\"dizzying fictional construction is grounded by such emotional intelligence that her heroine’s struggles always feel painfully, joyously real.\\" The novel was 20th in Paste's list of the 40 best novels of the 2010s, with Alexis Gunderson arguing, \\"No one gets to live as many lives and have as many second chances to get the next step right as protagonist Ursula Todd. But in a decade where the real world swung between wars and elections, there are few more clarifying literary escapes than Life After Life. [...] Atkinson’s sage weaves a heartbreaking, frightening and beautiful journey that’s written with tenacity and grace.\\" It was listed one of the decade's top ten fiction works by Time, where it was billed as \\"a defining account of wartime London, as Ursula experiences the devastation of the Blitz from various perspectives, highlighting the senselessness of bombing raids. The story of her multiple lives is both moving and lighthearted, filled with comic asides and evocative language about life’s many joys and sorrows.\\" Entertainment Weekly ranked it second, with David Canfield arguing that Life After Life \\"seamlessly executes an idiosyncratic premise [...] and contains a seemingly endless capacity to surprise\\", but that it \\"will stand the test of time for its in-between moments — its portraits of wartime, its glimpses into small domestic worlds, its understanding of one woman’s life as filled with infinite possibilities.\\" The novel was among the honorable mentions on the Literary Hub list of the 20 best novels of the decade. Awards and honours It won the 2013 Costa Book Awards (Novel). It was shortlisted for the 2013 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction, Waterstones Book of the Year (2013), and the Walter Scott Prize (2014).

Sootoro claims to be affiliated with the Civil Peace Committee for Syriac Orthodox. The Qamishli Sootoro is aligned with the Ba'athist government of Bashar Assad.  History  The Qamishli Sootoro should not be confused with the Sutoro police force which has the same name in the Syriac language, but uses the English translation \\"Syriac Protection Office\\" and the transliteration and a different emblem. The Sutoro is associated with the Syriac Union Party and integrated in the administration of the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. In February 2013, the Qamishli branch of the Sutoro began open operations in the Christian neighbourhood of Wusta, which is located near the city centre and has an Assyrian/Syriac majority with a significant Armenian minority. Though it was initially organised by the Syriac Union Party, the Qamishli militia was subsequently brought under the control of a so-called \\"peace committee\\" composed of several Christian organisations from the city. The SUP soon lost virtually all influence on this group, which became seen by many SUP members as being controlled by agents of the Syrian government. In late 2013, the split between this branch and the rest of the Sutoro became clear. Now transliterating its name as \\"Sootoro\\" (alternately referring to itself as the \\"Syriac Protection Office\\"), the militia in Qamishli adopted an entirely different logo and started openly asserting a separate identity. In November, the media office of the Qamishli Sootoro stated that it operated exclusively in the city of Qamishli and had not formed branches anywhere else, furthermore accusing militias outside the city of having appropriated their name. By December, the group was explicitly disavowing any connection to the SUP in their press releases. Though it continues to officially claim neutrality, the Qamishli Sootoro has become effectively a pro-government militia. Members of the group are frequently shown next to government flags and portraits of Bashar al-Assad in visual media, and flags bearing its distinct logo have been seen at pro- Assad rallies in the government-controlled sector of the city. Qamishli is one of the last places in northeast where government forces, having been pushed out of most of Hasakah Governorate by either rebel groups or the Kurdish- autonomist forces of the YPG, still maintain some presence. The Kurds control Kurdish populated districts of Qamishli, while Arab and Assyrian loyalist forces remain in majority-Arab and Assyrian districts in the south respectively, the city centre, the border crossing to Turkey, Qamishli Airport, and an army base on the southern outskirts. The assertion of loyalist control over the Qamishli militia has been identified as a potential effort by the government to strengthen its position in the city by expanding and solidifying its shrunken territorial holdings.

Biological photovoltaic devices are a type of biological electrochemical system, or microbial fuel cell, and are sometimes also called photo-microbial fuel cells or “living solar cells”. In a biological photovoltaic system, electrons generated by photolysis of water are transferred to an anode. A relatively high-potential reaction takes place at the cathode, and the resulting potential difference drives current through an external circuit to do useful work. It is hoped that using a living organism (which is capable of self-assembly and self-repair) as the light harvesting material, will make biological photovoltaics a cost-effective alternative to synthetic light-energy-transduction technologies such as silicon-based photovoltaics. Principle of operation An illustration of how a biological photovoltaic system operates. Like other fuel cells, biological photovoltaic systems are divided into anodic and cathodic half-cells. Oxygenic photosynthetic biological material, such as purified photosystems or whole algal or cyanobacterial cells, are employed in the anodic half-cell. These organisms are able to use light energy to drive the oxidation of water, and a fraction of the electrons produced by this reaction are transferred to the extracellular environment, where they can be used to reduce an anode. No heterotrophic organisms are included in the anodic chamber - electrode reduction is performed directly by the photosynthetic material. The higher electrode potential of the cathodic reaction relative to the reduction of the anode drives current through an external circuit. In the illustration, oxygen is being reduced to water at the cathode, though other electron acceptors can be used. If water is regenerated there is a closed loop in terms of electron flow (similar to a conventional photovoltaic system), i.e. light energy is the only net input required for production of electrical power. Alternatively, electrons can be used at the cathode for electrosynthetic reactions that produce useful compounds, such as the reduction of protons to hydrogen gas. Distinctive properties Similar to microbial fuel cells, biological photovoltaic systems which employ whole organisms have the advantage over non- biological fuel cells and photovoltaic systems of being able to self-assemble and self-repair (i.e. the photosynthetic organism is able to reproduce itself). The ability of the organism to store energy allows for power generation from biological photovoltaic systems in the dark, circumventing the grid supply and demand problems sometimes faced by conventional photovoltaics. Additionally, the use of photosynthetic organisms that fix carbon dioxide means the 'assembly' of the light harvesting material in a biological photovoltaic system could have a negative carbon footprint. Compared to microbial fuel cells, which use heterotrophic microorganisms, biological photovoltaic systems need no input of organic compounds to supply reducing equivalents to the system. This improves the efficiency of light-to- electricity conversion by minimising the number of reactions separating the capture of light energy and reduction of the anode. A disadvantage of using oxygenic photosynthetic material in bioelectrochemical systems is that the production of oxygen in the anodic chamber has a detrimental effect on the cell voltage. Types of biological photovoltaic system Biological photovoltaic systems are defined by the type of light harvesting material that they employ, and the mode of electron transfer from the biological material to the anode. Light harvesting materials The light harvesting materials employed in biological photovoltaic devices can be categorised by their complexity; more complex materials are typically less efficient but more robust. =Isolated photosystems= Isolated photosystems offer the most direct connection between water photolysis and anode reduction. Typically, photosystems are isolated and adsorbed to a conductive surface. A soluble redox mediator (a small molecule capable of accepting and donating electrons) may be required to improve the electrical communication between photosystem and anode. Because other cellular components required for repair are absent, biological photovoltaic systems based on isolated photosystems have relatively short lifetimes (a few hours) and often require low temperatures to improve stability. =Sub-cellular fractions= Sub-cellular fractions of photosynthetic organisms, such as purified thylakoid membranes, can also be used in biological photovoltaic systems. A benefit of using material that contains both photosystem II and photosystem I is that electrons extracted from water by photosystem II can be donated to the anode at a more negative redox potential (from the reductive end of photosystem I). A redox mediator (e.g. ferricyanide) is required to transfer electrons between the photosynthetic components and the anode. =Whole organisms= This biological photovoltaic system uses cyanobacterium growing in suspension, with an indium tin oxide anode. Biological photovoltaic systems that employ whole organisms are the most robust type, and lifetimes of multiple months have been observed. The insulating outer membranes of whole cells impedes electron transfer from the sites of electron generation inside the cell to the anode. As a result, conversion efficiencies are low unless lipid-soluble redox mediators are included in the system. Cyanobacteria are typically used in these systems because their relatively simple arrangement of intracellular membranes compared to eukaryotic algae facilitates electron export. Potential catalysts such as platinum can be used to increase permeability of the cellular membrane. Electron transfer to the anode Reduction of the anode by the photosynthetic material can be achieved by a direct electron transfer, or via a soluble redox mediator. Redox mediators may be lipid-soluble (e.g. vitamin K2), allowing them to pass through cell membranes, and can either be added to the system or produced by the biological material. =Inherent electrode reduction activity= Isolated photosystems and sub-cellular photosynthetic fractions may be able to directly reduce the anode if the biological redox components are close enough to the electrode for electron transfer to occur. In contrast to organisms such as dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria, algae and cyanobacteria are poorly adapted for extracellular electron export - no molecular mechanisms enabling direct reduction of an insoluble extracellular electron acceptor have been conclusively identified. Nevertheless, a low rate of anode reduction has been observed from whole photosynthetic organisms without the addition of exogenous redox-active compounds. It has been speculated that electron transfer occurs through the release of low concentrations of endogenous redox mediator compounds. Improving the electron export activity of cyanobacteria for use in biological photovoltaic systems is a topic of current research. =Artificial electron mediators= Redox mediators are often added to experimental systems to improve the rate of electron export from the biological material and/or electron transfer to the anode, especially when whole cells are employed as the light harvesting material. Quinones, phenazines, and viologens have all been successfully employed to increase current output from photosynthetic organisms in biological photovoltaic devices. Adding artificial mediators is considered an unsustainable practice in scaled-up applications, so most modern research is on mediator-free systems. Efficiency The conversion efficiency of biological photovoltaic devices is presently too low for scaled-up versions to achieve grid parity. Genetic engineering approaches are being employed to increase the current output from photosynthetic organisms for use in biological photovoltaic systems.

M. Homes. It won the 2013 Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (formerly the Orange Prize for Fiction). Writing and publication What became the first chapter of the novel was published as a short story in Granta Magazine 100th issue in 2007. It was selected by Salman Rushdie for The Best American Short Stories 2008. Homes went on to develop characters and plot as a novel. Plot The central character is Harry Silver, a professor based in New York City whose specialty is \\"Nixonology\\", the study of former US President Richard Nixon. His brother George is a TV executive who ends up in a psychiatric ward after a car accident in which two people die. Harry falls into an affair with George's wife Jane while trying to comfort and assist her. After walking out of the hospital, George finds them together and kills Jane. He is committed to a mental institution for the murder. This horrific first chapter of loss sets up the rest of the novel. In the aftermath of the scandal, Harry's wife leaves him. He moves from Manhattan into George's suburban life to care for his dog, and nephew and niece, a boy and a girl who each attend elite boarding schools. Harry functions as an innocent abroad in this different world, allowing for numerous satirical encounters and observations. He goes through a kind of redemption, cobbling together a kind of family, including three generations. Critical reaction Garth Risk Hallberg in The New York Times found influences of authors Don DeLillo and John Cheever in Homes' earlier work and this novel, saying while \\"Homes’s early work traded on the dissonance between the former’s 'Kulturkritik' and the latter’s introspection, “May We Be Forgiven” fumbles toward harmony.\\" He criticised Homes' style as too flat and minimalistic. He noted that Harry is \\"a figurative cousin to Jack Gladney, the “Hitler studies” scholar in DeLillo’s “White Noise”.\\" Hallberg found the book to be overly detailed and its satire superficial and dated. The review concluded by saying the novel was \\"a picaresque in which nothing much happens, a confession we can’t quite believe, a satire whose targets are already dead.\\" The Guardian found it a \\"very uneven novel, rickety, meandering and repetitive\\", impressive in its humor but featuring \\"an uneasy mixture of truism (be nice to children, animals, strangers) and kitsch (form friendships with immigrants who work at fast food outlets, listen to the wise medicine man)\\". It concluded, \\"'May We Be Forgiven' is a semi-serious, semi-effective, semi-brilliant novel which could not be called, overall, an artistic success. But you'd have to have no sense of the absurd, and no sense of humour, not to be pretty impressed.\\" The Independent found it very entertaining, with \\"delicious black humour, her sharp characterisation, and – yes – that thrilling narrative intensity.\\" Critic David Evans thought the work was too particular to stand for \\"state-of-the-nation\\" satire, as another critic had characterized it. The novel won the 2013 Women's Prize for Fiction, an annual literary award for novels by women writers published in English in the United Kingdom in the previous year.
