As characterized in American Anthropologist, multimodal anthropology is an \\"anthropology that works across multiple media, but one that also engages in public anthropology and collaborative anthropology through a field of differentially linked media platforms\\" (Collins, Durington & Gill). A multimodal approach also encourages anthropologist to reconsider the ways in which they conduct their research, to pay close attention to the role various media technologies and digital devices plays in the lives of their interlocutors, and how they these technologies redefine what fieldwork looks like.  History and background  Multimodal anthropology is not a new concept. It has been a fundamental part of anthropological research and fieldwork from the early days of the disciple. Anthropologists have been experimenting with different forms media technologies throughout the twentieth century whenever confronted with the limitation of text-based ethnography. Multimodal is a term that has readily been used since the 1970s in varied disciplines as psychotherapy, phonetics, genetics, literature and medicine to characterize different approaches to carrying out scientific research that involves to a certain degree, thinking outside of the box. In the early 1990s, semioticians used the terms to discuss different forms of communication across different media, eventually including digital media. Technological advances in the later part of the twentieth century, the accessibility to photography, film cameras and audio recorders led to the emergence of visual anthropology as a sub discipline dedicated to the study and production of ethnographic photography, film and media. Building in this legacy, multimodal anthropology seeks to expand the boundaries of visual anthropology to incorporate emerging technologies of twenty-first century including mobile networking, social media, geo-mapping, virtual reality, podcasting, interactive design, along with other traditional forms of learning and knowledge production like art and drawing that were often sidelined within visual anthropology, such as interactive gaming, theatre, performance, graphic novels, ethnofiction and experimental ethnography. As Samuel Collins, Matthew Durington and Harjant Gill note in their introductory essay on title \\"Multimodality: An Invitation,\\" published in American Anthropologist, \\"multimodal anthropologies does not attempt ‚Äì or desire ‚Äì to supplant visual anthropology. Rather it seeks to include traditional forms of visual anthropology while simultaneously broadening the purview of the discipline to engage in variety of media forms that exist today.\\" In 2018 the journal 'entanglements: experiments in multimodal ethnography' was first published, aiming to explore and advance the subfield. The journal is online and open access and is co-edited by Melissa Nolas and Christos Varvantakis. In the inaugural editorial the editors stated that \\"we aim to engage with some of the challenges and questions that contemporary multimodal ethnographic practice throws up: What knowledge do multimodal and multimedia encounters generate? What languages are available to researchers to describe the coming together of different modes and media? What are the everyday practices involved in such convergences and divergences? How might these encounters themselves be described?\\" Furthermore, \\"research is often an attempt to disentangle everyday experiences, those of our interlocutors as well as our encounters with them, and multimodality is no exception here. The analytical approaches of the social sciences tend towards the creation of order out of complexity asking us to categorise and organise our experiences and data in issues, themes, narratives and discourses. The messy actuality of practice, with its sensory dimensions and emotional hues, is often lost in this process (Ingold 2011). What if a different logic guided our analytical and practice endeavours?\\"  References  Further reading  Nolas, S-M., and Varvantakis, C.

Writer Ernest Kinoy called adapting the musical 'a tough assignment. Nothing dates faster than musical comedy.' Kinoy said he and director Fielder Cook agreed 'to break down the proscenium, to treat Brigadoon as if it had never been done before, but was created solely for this broadcast'. This meant the action went through the whole town, including inside buildings and taverns. One scene was shot in Malibu Canyon.Cost Poor Excuse Says TV Playwright By Jack Gaver. The Washington Post, Times Herald 28 Oct 1966: C7. The film accommodated much more of the score than the 1954 film version had, though the entire production ran only 90 minutes with commercials. \\"My Mother's Wedding Day\\" was restored to this version, though \\"Once in the Highlands\\", \\"Jeannie's Packin' Up\\", and \\"The Love of My Life\\" were still absent. 'The temptation is always to get so involved in plot that you have to cut out six or eight songs,' said Kinoy. 'In the case of Brigadoon, which has one of the loveliest scores ever composed for Broadway, that would be criminal negligence.' Sally Ann Howes was best known at the time for replacing Julie Andrews (on stage) in My Fair Lady.

Built in 1906‚Äì07, it was one of the many telephone exchanges built in Chicago in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as telephone use grew rapidly. Chicago architecture firm Pond and Pond designed the Classical Revival building. The building's design is noteworthy for its decorative elements, which include a dentillated cornice and belt course and an arched entrance with floral corbels. Early telephone exchanges were staffed almost entirely by women, and Pond and Pond believed that a decorative design would be more inviting to female workers than a plain and functional building. Major Chicago firm Holabird & Roche designed three additions to the building in 1913, 1928, and 1948. The telephone exchange closed in the 1960s, and the building was subsequently used by the Wilhelm K. Roentgen Elementary School through the 1990s.

Richard Grey, 2nd Baron Grey of Codnor (died 1335), of Codnor Castle, was an English soldier and diplomat. Life Grey was the eldest son of Henry Gray, 1st Baron Grey of Codnor (died 1308) and Eleanor de Courteney. Richard succeeded to his fathers titles in 1308, upon Henry's death. Richard was one of the barons who at the assembly of Stamford on 6 August 1309, signed a letter of remonstrance to the pope on the abuses in the church. He was employed in the Scottish wars in 1311, fought during the English defeat of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, and again in 1319-20 during the unsuccessful siege of Berwick and other confrontations against the Scots in the Scottish Marches. During the baronial revolt against King Edward II of England, known as the Despenser War, he assisted Roger Mortimer and the Marcher Lords, who attacked and plundered the Welsh possessions of royal favourite Hugh le Despenser, the younger. For these attacks, Richard was pardoned by Parliament in August 1321. Together with John Giffard and Robert de Shirland, they testified to the claim of Bartholomew Badlesmere that Despenser, the younger was a traitor. Misled by false letters, the rebels attempted to place Gray, Giffard and Shirland firmly on their side, however from the end of 1321 Gray was firmly on the side of Edward II, who took action against the baronial opposition. Richard served with the royal army, which pursued the rebels under the command of Thomas of Lancaster to the north of England. Grey remained in the favour of the king, who visited him after the victory over Lancaster in March 1322 at Grey's castle at Codnor, Derbyshire. In 1324 Gray was appointed to the office of Seneschal of Gascony and Steward of the Duchy of Aquitaine.. Gray resigned this office, in October 1324, serving Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent during the war in Gascony. He was then sent to defend Argentan, in the Duchy of Normandy. In 1326, Richard was Constable of Nottingham Castle and in 1327 he was employed in the Scotch marches, and was summoned for the Scottish war in 1334, but was excused on the ground of sickness. He died in 1335.

In the academic world, he served as the president of the College of the Holy Cross and rector of Woodstock College. He also was the superior of the Maryland-New York Province of the Jesuits and as the American assistant to the Jesuit Superior General in Rome.  Biography  Joseph Francis Hanselman was born in the Williamsburg neighborhood of the city of Brooklyn, New York (then independent of New York City) on October 28, 1856. He was born to Margaret and Henry Hanselman and had eight siblings. Of his six brothers, five became priests; both of his sisters became nuns. His brothers were James, John Thomas, George, Michael, and his sisters assumed the religious names of Vincent and Thomasina. He attended Saint Vincent College in Pennsylvania before completing his education at St. Francis Xavier College in New York City, where he graduated in 1877. Following his secular education, Hanselman entered the Grand S√©minaire de Montr√©al. However, soon thereafter, he instead decided to enter the Jesuit Order at West Park, New York in 1878. After some time teaching at St. Peter's College in Jersey City, he completed his formation Woodstock College and was ordained a priest in 1892. Hanselman was made the dean of studies and discipline at the College of the Holy Cross in 1893, where he remained until being appointed the president of the college in 1901. As president, he was responsible for overseeing the construction of Alumni Hall. He became the provincial superior of the Maryland-New York Province of the Society of Jesus in 1906. He remained in this position until becoming the rector of Woodstock College in 1918. In 1918, Hanselman was elevated to the position of American assistant-general to the Jesuit Superior General; he was the second person to hold this office. Unlike his predecessor, Thomas J. Gannon, S.J., Hanselman initially remained in the United States while holding the position, rather than move to Rome, due to the fighting of World War I. He held this post until his death on January 16, 1923. He was succeeded as the American assistant by Anthony Maas, S.J.

He was also known for his early efforts in historical and cultural preservation, especially in Dalarna. His paintings focused on rural subject matter, often depicted in winter settings.  Biography  He was a member of the noble Ankarcrona family. His father, Emil, was the Director of the Huskvarna Rifle Factory. His sister, , was a well known textile artist.Gunbritt Eklund och Inger Thunell: ‚ÄùGustaf Ankarcrona 1869-1933‚Äù, 2001, sid. 11-17. He began his education at the Per Brahe Secondary School, from 1883‚Äì1885. Having shown an interest in and aptitude for art, the painter Georg von Rosen was sufficiently impressed to recommend that he should receive professional art instruction. He also suggested that Germany would be a more suitable place for those studies than Paris. Accordingly, he spent the years 1886 to 1889 at the Academy of Arts, Berlin. From 1889 to 1890, he was in Norway, applying what he had learned. After returning to Berlin, he came under the influence of the Dachau School, which involved a style of painting known as \\"heimat-kunst\\" (home art). In 1895, he returned to Sweden and, from 1896 to 1901, had a studio in Stockholm where he specialized in portraits. In Days of Yore (1897) In 1890, he became a member of the , a group that stood in opposition to the methods of the Royal Academy, although his views on art were not especially radical. He participated in several of their exhibitions until 1898, when he was excluded for not following the assigned program. The year 1901 was an important turning point for his career, when he visited G√§vle and encountered a group of peasants from Leksand dressed in their native costumes. He was so enthused over what he saw that he immediately planned a trip to the area around Siljan in Dalarna, an area that had long attracted artists of the D√ºsseldorf School. Now it was home to a new art colony whose members included Emerik Stenberg, , and the sculptor . =Preservationist= Although he came to paint, he soon became more interested in the rapidly disappearing rural culture.Gunbritt Eklund och Inger Thunell: ‚ÄùGustaf Ankarcrona 1869-1933‚Äù, 2001, sid. 17-22. Soon, he had put together a large collection of cultural objects and began teaching preservation. He was particularly interested in wood carving and textiles and would often seek out older women who could still weave old patterns to place orders with them. Much of his work was inspired by that of the folklorist, Artur Hazelius.Gunbritt Eklund och Inger Thunell: ‚ÄùGustaf Ankarcrona 1869-1933‚Äù, 2001, s. 11-47. Resting (1889) He felt that homes should be intimately connected to their environment, and that each parish should preserve at least one old farm as a cultural center. His personal contribution to that project was the in T√§llberg, which he bought in 1908. Later, he bought several other old buildings which he had transported to there and rebuilt. The Holen served as both a museum and his personal residence. He also became interested in , a local form of wallpaper painting, and grew quite knowledgeable on the subject, but published very little. In 1915, he created the \\"Dalarnas Memorial and Homebuilding Association\\" which produced articles for the Lantbrukstidskrift f√∂r Dalarne, a local periodical. In addition to these activities, he was involved in the , a quasi-political youth group, and promoted sobriety. He also designed some buildings in Leksand, including Erik Axel Karlfeldt's farm. In his later years, he became something of a colorful local character; driving about in a carriage he had painted himself, drawn by a white horse.

YIFY releases were characterised through their consistent HD video quality in a small file size, which attracted many downloaders. The original YIFY/YTS website was shut down by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2015; however, numerous websites imitating the YIFY/YTS brand still receive a significant amount of traffic. The name \\"YIFY\\" is derived from the name of the website's New Zealand founder, Yiftach Swery.  History  YIFY Torrents was founded by Yiftach Swery in 2010 while he was studying computer science at University of Waikato. Yiftach is an app developer, web developer and archery champion from Auckland, New Zealand. In August 2011, the YIFY brand was gaining enough traffic to warrant the launch of an official YIFY Torrents Website, although it was eventually blocked by United Kingdom authorities. A backup website yify-torrents.im was launched for users to bypass this ban. The YIFY name continued to generate traction to the point where in 2013 'YIFY' was the most searched term on Kickass Torrents, along with other related search terms such as 'yify 720p', 'yify 2013' and 'yify 1080p'. This popularity was maintained through to 2015, where it was once again the most searched term on BitTorrent websites. In January 2014, Yiftach announced that he was retiring from encoding and uploading, mentioning that it was 'time for a change' in his life. The website rebranded to YTS, and moved to a new domain name at yts.re. \\"YTS\\" is an abbreviation of \\"YIFY Torrent Solutions\\". Management was handed over to the existing team of staff members, and encoding was delegated to a new automated system nicknamed \\"OTTO\\" which would handle future encodes and uploads. Yts.re owned a company based in the United Kingdom, officially incorporated on 5 February 2015, with Yiftach taking the role as a company \\"programmer\\". The company was officially dissolved in February 2016. The website was reprogrammed at both the frontend and backend in February 2015, as part of a site overhaul to deal with increased traffic. The domain name was suspended by the FRNIC registry in March 2015 as a result of legal pressure, and as a result, the website moved to a new domain yts.to by 20 March 2015. In October 2015, the YIFY website went down, with no word from any of the staff or those connected with the site, and no new YIFY releases. It was confirmed on October 30, 2015, that YIFY/YTS was shut down permanently. The site was shut down due to a lawsuit coming from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). They filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against the website's operator, accusing him of \\"facilitating and encouraging massive copyright infringement\\". This news came as a surprise to some, such as a spokesman for the New Zealand Screen Association who would have expected the site to have been operating from Eastern Europe, the case with some other past websites. Swery was able to settle out of court a month later, signing a non-disclosure agreement. Yiftach did not resist legal action in any way, and co-operated with authorities as needed. In a 2016 Reddit AMA, Yiftach justified this saying that he never intended to \\"put up a fight\\", and had frequently told himself \\"When someone asks you to stop properly, you stop\\".  Legacy = Unofficial clones = Since the shutdown of the official YIFY in 2015, many websites began to use the YIFY name unofficially. Some websites claimed to be the \\"new\\" YIFY, whilst others simply used the name for unrelated purposes such as streaming sites and subtitle download repositories, such as \\"YIFY Subtitles\\". One particular imitator, YTS.AG, appeared very quickly after the shutdown of the real YIFY. The clone website was started by the same group who created a fake EZTV website. YTS.AG indexed all of the old YIFY uploads, whilst adding their own uploads under their own branding. There was immediate backlash to the imitator websites by multiple torrent index sites; RARBG and ExtraTorrent banned all YIFY/YTS imposters, while Kickass Torrents allowed them under the condition that they were uploaded under a different name. They have shifted domain names multiple times throughout their lifespan and as of June 2020, are operating under the YTS.MX domain name. In May 2020, anti-piracy lawyer Kerry Culpepper sued multiple YIFY/YTS clones for trademark infringement. The Hawaii-based company \\"42 Ventures LLC\\" registered multiple trademarks related to movie piracy and torrenting (including YTS), and targeted the operators of yts.ws, yts.ms, yst.lt, yts.tl, ytsag.me, yts.ae, ytsmovies.cc and yts-ag.com for using the (newly registered) trademark without authorisation. Later, in June, the operator of YTS.WS (based in Russia) agreed to pay $200,000 in damages in relations to the trademark lawsuit. = In popular culture = In July 2016, the YIFY name made a cameo in an episode of the second season of the television series Mr. Robot, wherein the lead character Elliot is seen using the uTorrent client, and his Plex folder, filled with films from release groups such as RARBG and YIFY. When approached by TorrentFreak, Yiftach stated that he appreciated the 'bad ass' mention.

Gaillard IV de Durfort, Lord of Duras (died 1481), was a 15th-century Gascon noble of the Durfort family. Biography Durfort was the eldest son of Gaillard III de Durfort and his wife Judiote of La Lande. A minor upon his father's death in 1444, he inherited the titles and possessions of his father. He obtained in 1446 a safeguard or conduct to go to England and to return to Aquitaine at his pleasure. Durfort was one of the main vassals of the Duchy of Gascony. On 12 June 1451, he signed as representative of the nobility of Bordeaux, the treaty of capitulation of the city before the French army led by Jean de Dunois, Count of Dunois. The French anxious to conciliate the inhabitants of the region, offered them favourable conditions and they were permitted to maintain their existing titles and lands. The following year, he returned to the favour of the English, contributing to the return of Bordeaux to John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury. In 1453, after the French victory at the Battle of Castillon, the French routed the English forces from Gascony. The Count of Clermont invaded the Medoc, took Castelnau, while other French troops captured Cadillac. The castle of Blanquefort, held by Gaillard was the last to surrender. After the capture of Bordeaux, King Charles VII of France, issued directions that the leaders of the insurrection were to be saved, but to be exiled from France. Gaillard went to England, and his property in France, the lands and castles of Blanquefort, Duras and Villandraut, with the barony of Duras, were confiscated and entrusted to vassals loyal to the crown. He obtained from King Edward IV of England, the office of governor of Calais, which he defended against French attacks. He was knighted as a member of the Order of the Garter, and remained faithful to him during the War of the Roses. In 1470, he was chamberlain to the Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, whilst still retaining his functions at the English court. In 1473 Edward IV gave him the Lordship of Lesparre in the Medoc, a purely symbolic act and title since the English no longer had any control in Gascony. In 1474 he was one of the negotiators of the Treaty of London (25 July 1474), a temporary alliance between the Duchy of Burgundy and the Kingdom of England. Durfort was sent in 1475 at the head of English army to attempt to reclaim the Duchies of Brittany and Burgundy. King Louis XI of France recalled Durfort to France in June 1476 and returned his titles, lands and the castles of Blanquefort, Duras and Villandraut. As a result of Durfort's change of allegiance, he was expelled from the Order of the Garter. Gaillard was killed during a battle in Burgundy about 1481. Marriage and issue Durfort married Anne, daughter of the William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk and Alice Chaucer, they had the following known issue: *Aimery de Durfort (died before 1476) *Jean de Durfort *Georges de Durfort *Marguerite de Durfort He also had an illegitimate son Bertrand.

It is an acidophilic, mixotrophic, moderately thermophilic, Gram-positive, sporulating facultative anaerobe. As its name suggests, it is capable of oxidizing sulfur. Taxonomy S. thermosulfidooxidans, as well as the genus Sulfobacillus, were first described in 1978 based on isolates from Kazakhstan. S. thermosulfidooxidans is the type species of the genus. The genus is of uncertain taxonomic position, likely related to the genus Thermaerobacter and possibly representing either a deep branch of the Firmicutes or a separate phylum. Distribution and ecology S. thermosulfidooxidans is widely distributed in both natural and artificial acidic environments, including hot springs and acid mine drainage. Strains have been isolated from a variety of locations including China, Chile, Kazakhstan, California, and Zambia. Compared to other bacteria often found in similar environments, Sulfobacillus species are typically present at relatively low abundance. Growth and metabolism S. thermosulfidooxidans is acidophilic and moderately thermophilic; while different strains have slightly different pH and temperature growth optima, all prefer environments around pH 2.0 with optimal growth temperatures ranging from 45C to 55C. S. thermosulfidooxidans is iron- and sulfur-oxidizing, capable of oxidation of elemental sulfur, tetrathionate, and sulfides. Genome The genomes of several S. thermosulfidooxidans strains have been sequenced, demonstrating a genome size of 3.2-3.9 megabases, with a GC content of 48-49% and a number of bioinformatically defined protein-coding genes ranging from a low of about 3200 to a high of about 3900. All of the sequenced genomes contain large numbers of genes associated with sulfur oxidation; for example, genes encoding sulfur oxygenase reductase (SOR) and heterodisulfide reductase-like enzymes. The genetic basis of the species' iron oxidation capacity is less clear but likely involves a sulfocyanin protein. The genome also contains large numbers of transport proteins, including those specialized for metal ion efflux, and several CRISPR/Cas systems. There is evidence of horizontal gene transfer as a significant contributor to S. thermosulfidooxidans evolution, including an unexpected relationship between a SOR gene and similar genes found only in archaea.

Along with four poems attributed to Mesomedes, and not counting various fragments on papyrus, it is one of the only examples where a piece of ancient Greek music has survived in the manuscript tradition.West, M.L. (1994), Greek Music, p. 7. The six short fragments of music are in an appendix to the document. Two of these are very short, and one is an ascending and descending octave scale. They are notated in the type of notation used for instrumental music, and appear to have been designed for people learning to play, almost certainly on the double pipe known as an aulos.Hagel (2008), pp. 125-6. Among other things, the document explains the symbols used in music for notes which are extended to two, three, four, and five time-units (disemes, trisemes, tetrasemes, and pentasemes). The last two are not attested except in the Anonymus Bellermanni.West, M.L. (1994), Greek Music, p. 266. Other symbols mentioned in the treatise are the symbol for a musical rest (shaped Œõ), and the stigmai or dots above the note-symbols, which apparently indicate the arsis of the foot.Hagel (2008), p. 126. Examples of such stigmai are also found in the Seikilos epitaph and elsewhere. The six different musical examples are of different levels of rhythmic complexity. ¬ß100 (headed tetrasƒìmos) has bars of four time-units; ¬ß97 and ¬ß104 contain bars of 6 time-units (hexasƒìmos); ¬ß98 and ¬ß99 have eleven and twelve time-units in each bar; ¬ß101 is headed \\"of eight time-units\\" (oktasƒìmos) in the manuscript, but judging from the music which follows, this was plausibly emended to \\"of eighteen time-units\\" (okt≈çkaidekasƒìmos) by E.

Background In the lead up to the preceding 1999 Russian legislative election Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party encountered issues regarding its registration. The party instead competed under the temporary name of the Zhirinovsky Bloc. The party outperformed the polls, capturing 6% of the vote. This demonstrated the party's ability to retain strong loyalty amongst its base of fervent supporters. Zhirinovsky was not regarded to be a serious competitor in the 2000 presidential election. He was largely regarded to be a political \\"clown\\". Zhirinovsky nevertheless retained the support of dedicated followers, who were estimated to comprise between one and three percent of the Russian electorate. His appeal beyond that was hardly existent. Campaigning As a candidate Zhirinovsky stirred up support through wild antics as well as by appealing to commoners, and by using nationalistic rhetoric. Zhirinovsky had acquired a broad reputation for corruption by 2000. Zhirinovsky's campaign demonstrated a coziness between him an Putin, having become a favorite \\"opposition\\" candidate of Putin's administration. He was seen as, arguably, the most pro-Putin opponent of Putin in the 2000 presidential election. He had become a loyal ally of Putin in the Duma. He avoided criticizing Putin. Zhirinovsky instead focused attacks on others, such as Grigory Yavlinsky, who he accused of having been \\"bought\\" by wealthy supporters. Platform Zhirinovsky ran as a nationalist \\"law and order\\" candidate.

He was educated at the school of the Rev. James Pickbourne in Hackney, where he formed his life-long acquaintance with Samuel Rogers, a fellow-pupil. Legal career Maltby went on to study at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, but as a dissenter, did not take a degree. He practised law as a solicitor for at time with his elder brother, Rowland Maltby, who had been clerk to the Fishmongers' Company. On 23 June 1787 he was called to the bar at Gray's Inn. Rowland Maltby was a witness in 1809 for the parliamentary investigation into the affair of Mary Anne Clarke, supposed as a royal mistress to have sold army commissions. On 13 February he revealed the involvement of Russell Manners, a former Member of Parliament: he and Manners had married sisters. Librarian After the death of Richard Porson in 1808, William Maltby succeeded him as principal librarian of the London Institution on 1 February 1809; its library had been founded in 1806, and Maltby had William Upcott as assistant.

Biography Sigismunds Vidbergs came from an upper middle class family in Jelgava, where his father was a civil servant. He was encouraged to study art by his art teacher in school, and was introduced by him to the atelier of Johann Walter-Kurau. He then pursued art studies at the present-day Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy. He participated in an exhibition of Latvian artists in Riga in 1913, and in 1915 obtained his diploma from the academy. Subsequently, he received a scholarship intended to let him travel abroad to pursue further art studies, but the outbreak of World War I made it impossible. Instead, he spent the war teaching art and continuing his studies. After the Latvian War of Independence he returned to his native country, and in 1921 an exhibition was held with the works of Vidbergs in Latvia. During the first period of Latvian independence, the art of Vidbergs was well received and several exhibitions were made both in Latvia and abroad. He became a prominent member of the cultural life in Latvia, active as an art teacher, editor of an art magazine, chairman of the graphic artists' society, and he also held several positions at the Latvian National Museum of Art. Following the second occupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union, Vidbergs fled the country and eventually settled in the United States.

Stylistically, he was early on influenced by F√©lix Vallotton and much of his graphic art displays similarities with the works of Aubrey Beardsley. He was an exponent of Erotic art and has been described as one of the finest graphic artists in Latvia during the first half of the 20th century.

Prehistoric settlement in the UAE spanned the Neolithic, with a number of distinctive eras of ancient settlement including the Stone Age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures from 5,000 to 3,100 BCE; the Hafit period with its distinctive beehive shaped tombs and Jemdet Nasr pottery, from 3,200 to 2,600 BCE; the Umm Al Nar period from 2,600 to 2,000 BCE; the Wadi Suq Culture from 2,000‚Äì1,300 BCE and the three Iron Ages of the UAE. The UAE's Iron Age I spanned 1,200‚Äì1,000 BCE; Iron Age II, 1,000‚Äì600 BCE and Iron Age III from 600‚Äì300 BCE. This was followed by the Hellenistic Mleiha (or Late Pre-Islamic) era, from 300 BCE onwards through to the Islamic era which commenced with the culmination of the 7th century Ridda Wars. The remains of settlements, burials and other extensive evidence of human habitation throughout these eras is littered throughout the UAE, with many extensive finds of rich materials in the shape of pottery, jewellery, weapons and both human and animal remains providing archaeologists and researchers with an increasingly sophisticated picture of longstanding involvement in regional trade alongside nomadic cultures eking out a living from the frequently arid and inhospitable desert and mountain environment of the UAE. The first modern digs to take place in the Trucial States were led by teams from the Danish Moesgaard Museum in 1959 and focused the island of Umm Al Nar before going on to investigate the beehive tombs in and around the area of Al Ain (then often still known as Buraimi) in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.  First discovery  The 'Iron Age' building at Jebel Buhais The first archaeological excavations in the UAE were in 1959, led by Peter Glob and his assistant Geoffrey Bibby. Glob was a professor at Aarhus University and director of its Moesgaard Museum. He had undertaken a series of digs in Bahrain and was contacted by the director of Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd, an oil company, Temple Hillyard, who invited them to visit some graves he had found on the small island of Umm Al Nar (then referred to as Umm an-Nar), having been directed to the site by the then-Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan Al Nahyan. Hillyard had already determined that the tumuli were 'reminiscent of the Bronze Age one in Bahrain'. During excavations at Umm Al Nar, the Ruler's brother, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan visited the dig and told the archaeologists that there were many more such artefacts in Al Ain. He invited them to visit him and led them to a group of some 200 burial cairns ‚Äì what would later turn out to be Hafit period burials. Zayed later took members of the Danish team to other sites in the area, including a low tell which is now known as Rumailah, a significant Iron Age site. Subsequent excavations by teams from Iraq in the 1970s unveiled the Jebel Buhais site, as well as the hugely significant ancient city of Ed-Dur. Since then, digs have taken place around the UAE by teams from universities in France, Spain, Germany, Jordan, Australia and the UK.  Prehistory  The Mleiha Archaeological Centre displays evidence of the oldest archaeological finds in the UAE, the prehistoric Faya-1 collection, which dates human occupation in the area to 130,000‚Äì120,000 BCE and has been linked to the movement of the first anthropologically modern humans from Africa to populate the world. The Faya discovery, made in 2011, includes primitive hand-axes, as well as several kinds of scrapers and perforators, which resemble those used by early modern humans in East Africa. Through the technique of thermoluminescence dating the artefacts were placed at 125,000 years old. This is the earliest evidence of modern humans found anywhere outside Africa and implies modern humans left Africa much earlier than previously thought. Mleiha is also the site of Neolithic as well as Umm Al Nar period burials, and gives its name to the Hellenistic Mleiha period (now more commonly referred to as the 'late pre-Islamic period'), from 300 BCE onwards, characterised by the extensive fortified compound, 'Mleiha Fort', which was discovered in the late 1990s and is thought to have been possibly the seat of an ancient South Arabian kingdom. The oldest radiometrically dated inland burial site in the UAE is the extensive necropolis at Jebel Buhais. The site, located near Madam, in Sharjah, consists of burial sites spanning the Stone, Bronze, Iron and pre-Islamic ages of human settlement in the UAE. Burials at Jebel Buhais (Jebel is Arabic for mountain) date back to the 5th millennium BCE.  Arabian bifacial  During the glacial maximum period, 68,000 to 8,000 BCE, Eastern Arabia is thought to have been uninhabitable. Finds from the stone age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures (including knapped stone arrow and axe heads as well as Ubaid pottery) show human habitation in the area from 5000 to 3100 BCE. The archaeological record shows that Arabian Bifacial/Ubaid period came to an abrupt end in eastern Arabia and the Oman peninsula at 3800 BC, just after the phase of lake lowering and onset of dune reactivation. There is no evidence of human presence in the area for approximately 1,000 years, the so-called \\"Dark Millennium\\". This is thought to be consistent with changing patterns of human life as a result of climate change: a spring discovered at Jebel Buhais dried up at this stage, an event contemporaneous with similar discoveries pointing to increased aridity in the interior of Oman. Throughout Southern Arabia, evidence of human inland settlement in the 3rd millennium BCE is scant.  Ed-Dur  One of the most significant archaeological sites in the UAE is that at Ed-Dur, an Ancient Near Eastern City located in Umm Al Qawain. One of the largest sites in the country, comprising an area of some five kilometres, the coastal settlement overlooks the Al Beidha Lake. It has been dubbed 'one of the most significant lost cities of Arabia'. It was first discovered by an Iraqi archaeological team in 1973 and first dug in 1974. Subsequent digs have unearthed evidence of human habitation spanning the Ubeid period, Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Pre-Islamic period. During the latter period the settlement appears to have been at its most prosperous and the hills of the area were entirely covered with dozens of buildings and thousands of stone-built tombs. Some 500 of these tombs have been excavated, with grave goods discovered including drinking sets, Roman glass, weaponry, pottery, jewelry and ivory objects. It is thought some 20,000 tombs are on the site in all. Similarly, the necropolis of Jebel Buhais spans a remarkable period, with burials evident as far back as the fifth millennium BCE, while Mleiha also represents human settlement dating back some 7,000 years.  Hafit period  Jebel Hafit The Hafit period is marked by (and named for) the distinctive 'beehive' tombs first discovered around the area of Jebel Hafit in Al Ain. The period defines early Bronze Age human settlement in the United Arab Emirates and Oman in the period from 3,200 to 2,600 BC. Hafit period tombs and remains have also been located across the UAE and Oman in sites such as Bidaa bint Saud, Jebel Buhais and Buraimi in the UAE and Bat, Al-Khutm and Al-Ayn in Oman. The first find of Hafit era tombs is attributed to the Danish archaeologist P.V. Glob of the Moesgaard Museum (who also investigated Umm Al Nar) in 1959, and the first of many excavations of these took place a few years later. uncovering the remains of some 317 circular stone tombs and settlements from the Hafit period, as well as wells and partially underground falaj irrigation systems, and mud brick constructions intended for a range of defensive, domestic and economic purposes. The Al Ain Oasis, in particular, provides evidence of construction and water management enabling the early development of agriculture for five millennia, up until the present day. Pottery finds at Hafit period sites demonstrate trading links to Mesopotamia, contiguous to the Jemdat Nasr period (3100‚Äì2900 BC). Evidence of trading links with Mesopotamia are also found in the subsequent Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods of UAE history.  Umm Al Nar period  the Louvre, Abu Dhabi. The Bronze Age Umm Al Nar period spans the period 2600‚Äì2000 BCE. The name is derived from the first excavations which took place at Umm Al Nar, an island on the coast of Abu Dhabi, in 1959. The distinctive circular tombs of the Umm Al Nar period distinguish it from the preceding Hafit period, together with finds of distinctive black on red decorated pottery and jewellery made with gems such as carnelian, sourced from the Indus Valley. Seven tombs from a total of fifty and three areas at the ruins of the ancient settlement were examined by the Danish archaeologists in the 1959 season. During their first visit they identified a few exposed shaped stones fitted together at some of the stone mounds. The following year, the first excavations started at one of the mounds on the plateau, now called Tomb I. Two more seasons (1960 and 1961) involved digging more tombs, while the last three seasons (1962‚Äì63, 1964 and 1965) were allocated to examining the settlement. The Danish excavations at Umm Al Nar halted in 1965 but work resumed in 1975 by an archaeological team from Iraq. During the Iraqi excavations which lasted one season, five tombs were excavated and a small section of the village was examined. Between 1970 and 1972 an Iraqi restoration team headed by Shah Al Siwani, former member of the Antiquities Director in Baghdad, restored and/or reconstructed the Danish excavated tombs. Mleiha At Al Sufouh Archaeological Site in Dubai, archaeological excavation between 1994 and 1995, revealing an Umm Al Nar type circular tomb dating between 2500 and 2000 B.C. Dubai Municipality and the Sanisera Archaeology Institute conducted excavations at the site of Al Ashoosh between November 2015 and May 2016. The site was discovered during two seasons of survey in 2002‚Äì2003 following the discovery of the nearby Iron Age metallurgical centre Saruq Al Hadid, and is located 8 km from that site. Surveys in the area by Dubai Municipality and the Department of Antiquities of Jordan identified 33 archaeological sites ranging in date from prehistory to the late Islamic period. In 2006‚Äì2007, more-detailed archaeological investigations of the area of Al-Ashoosh were conducted, including survey, excavation and geological sampling. At Tell Abraq, settlements associated with the start of the Umm Al Nar culture began c. 2500 BC. Finds at Shimal and Ed Dur also point to a transitional period between the Umm Al Nar and following Wadi Suq periods. The excavations at Shimal, principally those of the mid-1980s by a team from the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany, are significant as they provided early evidence of the 'Wadi Suq' period, including finds of pottery, soft-stone vessels, bronze and copper weapons and beads which came to be regarded as typical of the period c. 2000‚Äì1300 BC in the UAE.  Wadi Suq period  Wadi Suq burial at Shimal, Ras Al Khaimah The Wadi Suq culture flourished in the period from 2,000 to 1,300 BCE. It takes its name from a wadi, or waterway, East of Sohar in Oman. Rather than a seismic cultural shift, a gradual change in human society which is centred around more sophisticated approaches to animal husbandry, particularly the domestication of the camel, as well as changes in the surrounding trade and social environments, took place between the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods. The transition between Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq is thought to have taken some 200 years and more, with finds at the important Wadi Suq site of Tell Abraq in modern Umm Al Quwain showing evidence of the continuity of Umm al-Nar burials. At Qattara Oasis in Al Ain, the Wadi Suq communal tomb is thought to have been constructed from stones recovered from previous Umm Al Nar burials. Evidence of increased mobility among the population points to a gradual change in human habits rather than sudden change and important Wadi Suq era sites such as Tell Abraq, Ed Dur, Seih Al Harf, Shimal and Kalba show an increasing sophistication in copper and bronze ware as well as trade links both east to the Indus Valley and west to Mesopotamia. Changes in two important trading partners also took place during this period, with the Mesopotamian city of Ur falling to Elam in 2,000 BC and the decline of the Indus Valley Harappan Culture in 1,800 BC. The abandonment of the port of Umm Al Nar took place at around this time. Wadi Suq burial at Jebel Buhais The Wadi Suq site at Seih Al Harf in Ras Al Khaimah was first excavated by a team from the University of Durham, led by Derek Kennet, in the spring of 2013. The site comprises a series of 50 burial sites, of which two were directly threatened by road development, an 18-metre horseshoe shaped and a W-shaped tomb. Both were collective graves. Ten other excavated features were also impacted by the road development. Although the site was seen to be threatened by the development of the northern extension of the arterial Emirates Road (E611), with proposals tabled to amend the road development to avoid damage to the site, the road project went ahead. A number of Wadi Suq and Iron Age discoveries were made in the mountain village of Bithnah in Fujairah, first excavated by the Swiss-Liechtenstein Foundation for Archaeological Research Abroad (SLFA) between 1987 and 1991. Presided over by Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein, and directed in the field by Pierre Corboud, the SLFA team conducted several seasons of survey in the mountainous inland area of Fujairah, including the excavations at Bithnah, where a communal grave site was uncovered as well as a number of Iron Age finds. There have also been excavations by teams from the University of Geneva and French National Research Centre. Significant Iron Age finds have been made throughout the area, including a number of petroglyphs.  Iron Age  From 1,200 BC to the advent of Islam in Eastern Arabia, through three distinctive Iron Ages (Iron Age 1, 1200‚Äì1000 BC; Iron Age II, 1000‚Äì600 BC and Iron Age III 600‚Äì300 BC) and the Hellenistic Mleiha period (300 BC onward), the area was variously occupied by Archaemenid and other forces and saw the construction of fortified settlements and extensive husbandry thanks to the development of the falaj irrigation system (also called qanat). Early finds of aflaj, particularly those around the desert city of Al Ain, have been cited as the earliest evidence of the construction of these waterways. It is thought nearby Bidaa bint Saud became an important site during the Iron Age, both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used the falaj irrigation system there. Two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at Bidaa bin Saud, with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition. In one of the excavations, a number of sandstone-lined shaft holes were discovered, as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern. Evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at the site. Snake decoration on a pot from Rumailah Important Iron Age centres in the UAE have rendered an unusual richness in finds to archaeologists, particularly the spectacular metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid in what is today Dubai. Other important Iron Age settlements in the country include Al Thuqeibah, Madam, Bidaa bint Saud, Ed-Dur and Tell Abraq. P. Hellyer, New finds at Tell Abraq. Tribulus (Journal of the Emirates Natural History Group), vol. 2, no.1, pp.15-17, 1992 Iron Age burials at Jebel Buhais, particularly the group of graves defined as BHS 85, are thought to be linked to the nearby Iron Age settlement site of Al Thuqeibah. The site was originally excavated by teams from the Autonomous University of Madrid in the mid-1990s. Thuqeibah has been dated from the Iron Age II and III periods (1100‚Äì400 BC). A settlement consisting of a number of houses and a well, it has been associated with a nearby Iron Age falaj system, thought to date from the Iron Age II era. 1st Millennium aflaj have also been unearthed at nearby Al Madam. Qattara The site of Rumailah, in Al Ain, like many in the UAE spans a wide period with finds dating back to the Umm Al Nar period, but shows a flourishing during the Iron Age. Finds at Rumailah include distinctive pottery adorned with snake patterns, similar to finds at Qusais, Masafi and the major Iron and Bronze Ages; metallurgical production centre at Saruq Al Hadid, as well as chlorite vessels decorated with turtles alternating with trees, similar to finds from Qidfa' in Fujairah, Qusais in Dubai and Al-Hajar in Bahrain. A number of Iron Age swords and axe-heads, as well as distinctive seal moulds, were also recovered from the site. A number of bronze arrowheads were also found at the site. The Iron Age buildings found at Rumailah are typical of those found in the region, at Iron Age I and II sites such as Al Thuqeibah and Muweilah, with a number of row dwellings, although lacking the perimeter walls found at Thuqeibah. A columned hall at Rumailah provides a further link to Muweilah, while a number of pyramidal seals found at Rumailah find an echo with similar objects discovered at Bidaa bint Saud. One of the most significant Iron Age sites in the UAE is Muweilah, located in the Sharjah suburb of Al Jurainah, near Sharjah University City. A large, fortified settlement thought to have been occupied during the Iron Age II period (1100‚Äì600BC), the site has been explored by archaeologists since an Australian expedition started work there in 1994 after the discovery of pottery shards by a local resident. It has yielded the oldest known example of writing found to date in the UAE, a pottery shard with an inscription, thought to be Sabean, with the letters 'bml'.  Saruq Al Hadid  Gold jewelry from Saruq Al Hadid The Saruq Al Hadid site in the desert south of Dubai was a centre of constant human habitation, trade and metallurgy from the Umm Al Nar period (2600‚Äì2000 BCE) to 1,000 BCE, when it was a major location for smelting bronze, copper and Iron. Arguably its most important period of flourishing was as a metallurgical centre in the Iron Age II period (1100‚Äì600 BCE). One of the many thousands of finds to be documented at the site was an ornate gold ring, which became the inspiration for Dubai's Expo 2020 logo. Some of the many enigmas surrounding the site are its location far from sources of water, ore or firewood, all critical elements to a metallurgical centre. An abundance of pottery and metal artifacts have given rise to speculation of possibly identifying the site as a centre of snake worship. In all, over 12,000 unique objects have been unearthed at the site. A number of key finds are on public display at Dubai's Saruq Al Hadid Archaeology Museum in Al Shindagha, housed in a traditional barjeel (wind tower) building constructed in 1928 by Sheikh Juma bin Maktoum Al Maktoum.  Post Islamic finds  Archaeologists have worked on post- Islamic era sites across the UAE, particularly in Ras Al Khaimah (the coastal settlement of Julphar) and the East Coast. On the East Coast, in Fujairah, the village of Bidayah has been the focus of a number of explorations of its mosque and the remains of a Portuguese fort, discovered in the village by a team of Australian archaeologists. The fort, originally called 'Libidia', was identified from a 16th-century map. Its walls were constructed using rock recovered from a nearby tower dated back to the third millennium BCE. These walls, some 60 metres in length, are joined in a square with towers on each corner and stand today at a height of up to a meter. Finds at the site of the fort include locally made pottery dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries and charcoal samples unearthed were carbon dated to 1450‚Äì1600, within the context of the Portuguese presence in the Gulf. The Bidayah mosque's date of construction is uncertain and because the mud and stone built structure uses no wood, radiocarbon dating is not possible. It is estimated to date to the 15th century, however some much earlier estimates have been proposed. The site was investigated by the archaeological center of Fujairah in co-operation with the University of Sydney from 1997‚Äì98. and Fujairah Archaeology and Heritage Department came up with the conclusion that the mosque was believed to be built in 1446 AD, along with the two watch towers overlooking the mosque and the village.

Secretary of State Dean Acheson outlined the U.S. position on the defense of Western Europe in a series of initiatives that embodied the ‚ÄúOne Package‚Äù proposal submitted to President Truman on September 5th, 1950. The proposal met strong resistance from the French who were committed to a neutral, demilitarized Germany called for in the Potsdam and Yalta agreements. The proposal received support from Britain, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway; however, the rest of the founding NATO countries remained uncommitted in order to measure French reaction.Bjornstad, Stein ‚ÄúThe Soviet Union and German Unification During Stalin‚Äôs Last Years‚Äù Oslo: Institutt for Forsvarastudier (IFS).‚Äù p. 21.  Background  Beginning in late 1947 the U.S. Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency maintained that the defense of Europe could not be met without the willing and active participation of (West) Germany and control of the Ruhr.Leffler, Melvyn ‚ÄúThe Struggle for Germany and Origins of the Cold War‚Äù Sixth Alois Mertes Memorial Lecture 1996, German Historical Institute, Washington D.C.

Paper No.16.,p.46. This view was also shared in early 1950 by several officials on the continent of Europe such as Field Marshall Viscount Montgomery, General Omar Bradley, General Lucius D. Clay and Konrad Adenauer. However, until the invasion of South Korea by North Korea in Jun of 1950, the U.S. State Department‚Äôs policy was to continue with German demilitarization. The start of the Korean War brought stronger support for West German participation in European defense. Specifically, The High Commissioner for Occupied Germany John J. McCloy stated to Secretary of State Dean Acheson that if Germany was lost militarily there would be no hope of getting it back and General George C. Marshall also stated directly to Acheson that the invasion by North Korea showed the Soviet Union was prepared to use force (initially, through satellite countries) to achieve political ends. As a result of this strong support, Acheson declared that, ‚Äúmy conversion to German participation in European defense was quick,‚Äù and subsequently on July 31, 1950 discussed with President Truman different methods of merging West Germany‚Äôs military contribution into a European Army or North Atlantic Army with an integrated command and supply system. Influenced by Acheson‚Äôs strong advocation for (West) German military participation in the defense of Western Europe, President Truman on August 27, 1950 gave Acheson and Secretary of Defense Louis Johnson a list of questions on how to specifically strengthen the defense of Europe and (West) Germany‚Äôs participation in it.Acheson, Dean 1969 ‚ÄúPresent at the Creation: My Years in the State Department.‚Äù W.W. Norton & Company, p.436.  The ‚ÄúOne Package‚Äù Proposal  The U.S. Defense Department believed that the defense of Europe needed to be augmented by increased allied forces, increased American troops, increased military aid, inclusion of armed German units and to integrate the entire effort under one command. However, the Department was steadfast that all of the elements needed to be in, ‚Äúone package.‚Äù The Defense Department said it would not recommend more forces in Europe, or the responsibility of the United States assuming the unified command of a combined European force, unless there was also armed (West) German participation.Large C, David 1996 ‚ÄúGermans to the Front: West German Rearmament in the Adenauer Era‚Äù University of North Carolina Press, p. 84. The Defense Department and State Department agreed to the ‚ÄúOne Package Proposal‚Äù and delivered it to President Truman on September 5, 1950 as an encapsulation of the list of questions he had given them on how to strengthen the defense of Europe. The proposal specifically stated that:Acheson, Dean 1969 ‚ÄúPresent at the Creation: My Years in the State Department.‚Äù W.W. Norton & Company, p.439. #There should be an increase in U.S. ground forces in Europe of four to six divisions. #That an armed German division should be added without a German general staff. #There should be substantial increase in French and British forces in Europe. #That all allied forces, including the U.S., should be combined in to a European (NATO) Defense Force with an international staff and a Supreme Commander. #That an executive group should be established in the NATO Military Production and Supply Board to coordinate and increase European military production and supply. #That the U.S. would accept the responsibility of supreme command: #*Only if the U.S. allies request it. #*Only if the U.S. allies undertook the obligations previously outlined in the proposal. #*Only long enough to discover whether the U.S. allies could perform the obligations outlined in the proposal.  French reaction  From the outset, according to Secretary of State Acheson, the French took the proposal very hard. Prime Minister Robert Schuman said that he embraced every aspect of the proposal except German military participation. On October 5, after the 5th session of the North Atlantic Council was adjourned, the French countered the U.S. proposal with the Pleven Plan. The Pleven Plan stated that: #European allies would pledge forces for the defense of Europe under the command of a Supreme Commander in a time of war. #In addition, a standing, special European army would be created under a European Minister of defense, also under the Supreme Commander, with its own command and staff structure. The army would be composed of contributions from the allies and a German contingent at the battalion level. The force would be composed of about 100,000 men.Acheson, Dean 1969 ‚ÄúPresent at the Creation: My Years in the State Department.‚Äù W.W. Norton & Company, p.459. To the French, the Pleven Plan had the attraction of a German contribution to the defense of Europe (though a small one )without ‚Äúrearmament of Germany‚Äù. That is, without the creation of a German Ministry of Defense, armament industry, or general staff. The American‚Äôs, however, felt that the German contribution was too limited and subsequently countered with the Spofford Plan (also known as the Spofford Compromise) which the French accepted. The Spofford Plan was finalized at the December, 1950 6th Session of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels where the integrated defense of NATO was finalized and General Dwight D. Eisenhower was designated the first Supreme Allied Commander Europe(SACEUR) and included a German contribution to the defense of Western Europe.North Atlantic Council Sixth Session, Brussels Dec. 1950 - ‚ÄúJoint Report on The German Contribution To the Defense of Western Europe by the North Atlantic Council Deputies and the Military Committee to the North Atlantic Council and the Defense Committee‚Äù, NATO, p.2. , Unclassified Document: C6-D/1 (Also DC.29/1)OR.

Brief introduction  During the 18th and 19th century, a large number of Chinese labors went across the borderline in southwest provinces of China, entered into northern Vietnam to work in mines, and became the so-called migrant Chinese miners. This group of people promoted trans-border communication and changed the landscape of the Sino-Vietnam border area. They contributed to the economic development in the border area and northern Vietnam; in addition, they also influenced the border policy of both sides. The impacts of Chinese miners in the frontier have to be seen from both positive and negative aspects. On one hand, cross-border population movement promoted transnational communication, and Chinese miners motivated the development of mining industry in northern Vietnam, which was an important source of financial revenue for Vietnamese government in the 18th century. On the other hand, because either China or Vietnam did not have the direct control of these migrant Chinese miners, this group of people threatened the stability of the border area. Rebellions involved Chinese miners profoundly affected the frontier society and the border policies of both sides. Qing government even closed the border in the second half of the 18th century. The trend of Chinese migrant miners reached its peak in the mid to late 18th century. After two large-scale rebellions in the 1770s and 1830s, the mining industry in northern Vietnam went down. Chinese miners in northern Vietnam have also faded out of our vision. However, in the 18th and 19th centuries, migrant Chinese miners played a significant role in the economic and social development of northern Vietnam.  Background  Metal product trades between China and Southeast Asia had existed for several hundred years before the 18th century. Siam, Burma, Malaya, and Dai Viet had built business contacts with China since the 10th century. Until the 15th and 16th century when the age of discovery came, China was the largest trading partner of metal products of Southeast Asian countries because of the advanced mining and smelting technology.Anthony Reid. (2011). Chinese on the Mining Frontier in Southeast Asia. Chinese circulations: capital, commodities, and networks in Southeast Asia, 21-36 Cheaper metal products from China were popular in the Southeast Asian market. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's rich mineral resources also met China's demand for silver, copper, tin and other metals. Vietnam, until the 10th century, if not early, had established stable trade relations with China. At least four major trade routes connect Yunnan Province in China and Tonkin in Vietnam, and one of the key commodities of such cross-border trade was metal.Giersch, C. P. (2011). Cotton, Copper, and Caravans: Trade and the Transformation of Southwest China. Chinese circulations: capital, commodities, and networks in Southeast Asia. 37-61 The border province Yunnan was one of the main mineral producing areas in China. In the mid-fourteenth century, Yunnan was producing over half of the gold and silver circulating in the Chinese economy.Giersch, C. P. (2014). Commerce and empire in the borderlands: How do merchants and trade fit into Qing frontier history? Frontiers of History in China, 9(3), 361-383 Considering that the development of Yunnan's mining industry began early and mature, there were a large number of skilled miners and laborers in this border province. This group of people became migrant workers. When the time came to the 18th century, the prosperity of Qing dynasty boosted the economic development in Yunnan, and the rapidly growing population in the southwest of China promoted cross-border population movement. On Vietnam side, after the East India trading companies withdrew from Vietnam in the early 18th century, Le-Trinh regime in northern Vietnam was eager to find new sources of income to alleviate the shortage of funds caused by the termination of trade with West. Mining thus became a significant supplement to the state. Despite realizing that the uncontrolled increase of Chinese miners might bring potential instability, Trinh regime still allowed and even encouraged Chinese miners to participate in Vietnamese mining industry. Therefore, hundreds of Chinese miners crossed the border and chose to become workers in Vietnam territory, which fueled a trend of trans-border miner movement.  Development of mining industry in the 18th century = Development before 1775 = The mountainous area in northern Vietnam was rich in minerals. In the late 17th century, thanks to the Chinese trans-border commercial activities, the development of the mining industry in the northern frontier of Vietnam reached a record high level. Meanwhile, in China, private mining was prohibited by the Qing government until 1749. As a result, Chinese businessmen and labors began to enter the mining industry abroad in the early era of Qing dynasty.Èü¶Â∫ÜËøúÔºåÈ≤ÅÁ¥†.

(2011). Chinese on the Mining Frontier in Southeast Asia. Chinese circulations: capital, commodities, and networks in Southeast Asia, 21-36 There are no detailed records of official historical materials showing the number of Chinese miners in Vietnam.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, the average annual output of the two largest mines in northern Vietnam reached 220 to 280 tons, and this frontier region became one of the largest copper producing complexes in Asia at that time.Alexander Woodside.

Anthony Reid. 256-260. = Policy of the Vietnamese government = For these miners from China, the Vietnamese government formulated some corresponding management measures. It was warlord era in the 18th century in Vietnam. Le-Trinh regime controlled the northern part of Vietnam while Nguyen regime occupied the south. Both of Le-Trinh and Nguyen needed a large number of military squads. Nguyen regime in the south, to increase its fiscal revenue, encouraged maritime trade. Many Chinese merchant ships traveled extensively to southern Vietnam for commerce. In the north, Trinh Lord encouraged Sino-Vietnamese border trade, and vigorously developed the mining industry in the northern mountainous areas. Trinh Lord allowed Chinese miners to cross the border to Vietnam territory for mining activities. As long as they receive a license issued by Trinh Lord and paid the tax, Chinese miners could work with the Vietnamese, even if the continuous increasing of trans-border population led many conflicts.ÈôàÊñáÔºöÊ∏Ö‰ª£‰∏≠Ë∂äÈôÜÂú∞ËæπÂ¢ÉË∑®Â¢ÉÈóÆÈ¢òÁÆ°ÁêÜ(1644-1840)Ôºå„Ää‰∏≠ÂõΩÂéÜÂè≤Âú∞ÁêÜËÆ∫‰∏õ„Äã2011 Âπ¥Á¨¨ 1 Êúü Á¨¨ 82-92 È°µ In the 1760s, Le-Trinh regime adopted new policies to stimulate the development of the mining industry. It allowed local authorities and officials using their private capital to run one or two mines. The mine owners could select labors from both local and abroad. After the mine had declared and paid taxes for five years, the officials who succeeded in operating mines could remain control of the mines forever.Li, Tana. 2003. ‚ÄúVietnamese Mints and Chinese Miners in Eighteenth-Century Northern Vietnam.‚Äù Paper presented at the International Convention of Asian Studies 3, Singapore. This privatization policy promoted the expansion of the mining industry.

Hanoi: Nxb Th·∫ø gi·ªõi. 698 = Passport system of the Qing government = Long-term stable and prosperous trans-border communication provided the proper condition for the movement of miners. Chinese migrants greatly stimulated trans-border trade and promoted the local development. New towns were founded by the migrants and more Chinese began to manage shops and restaurants nearby mine sites. Because the miners were generally male, their family (mainly women and children) took part in the trans-border trade, which stimulated goods circulation. Some commodities became cheaper in the border area than in Red River Delta, and entertainment could be found easily.Li Tana. (2012) Between Mountains and the Sea. Journal of Vietnamese Studies, Vol.7, Issue 2, 71 While stimulating Vietnam's economic development and prosperity in the frontier, Chinese miners also brought silver bracelets back to China. Silverware was popular in Yunnan and Guangxi provinces in the 18th century.[Ê∏Ö]ËµµÁøº:„ÄäÊ™êÊõùÊùÇËÆ∞„ÄãÂç∑4,„ÄäÁºÖÁî∏ÂÆâÂçóÂá∫Èì∂„Äã With the increasing trans-border activities, more and more small frictions and conflicts occurred in the border area. In response to the chaotic border management situation, Maertai, Viceroy of Guangdong-Guangxi provinces, proposed new border management regulations. Qing government redefined the border gateways (ÂÖ≥Âè£) and established the Yaopai (ËÖ∞Áâå) and Yinpiao (Âç∞Á•®) system, which was like the modern passport system, to systematically manage cross-border merchants. People who frequently crossed the border needed to apply Yaopai and Yinpiao (passport) from the government as identity documents for crossing border; the government provided convenience and simple border-crossing procedures for those who had such documents. This system allowed the authorities to better manage cross- border personnel on the one hand and reduced the formalities required for cross-border traders, on the other hand, which made cross-border communication more convenient.Herr, J. C. (2017). Fraught collaboration: Diplomacy, intermediaries, and governance at the china-vietnam border, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. 263 Under the passport system, more miners flowed into Vietnam in the mid-18th century.  Tong Tinh Mines incidents and mining situation in the late 18th century  Border issue was particularly sensitive in Qing-Le relationship. There were been many rebellions in the Sino- Vietnamese border area in the 18th century. Tong Tinh mines incident was the largest one of them and had a great influence on the mining industry in northern Vietnam and national relationship. Tong Tinh mines (ÈÄÅÊòüÂéÇ) were mines in Thai Nguyen province in Vietnam. By the mid-18th century, many miners and their families gathered at the Tong Tinh mining site and made it a larger settlement. Restaurants, teahouses, medicine shops, and other facilities appeared here, making Tong Tinh a prosperous town in the border frontier. Tong Tinh mines produced a variety of minerals, while the main source was silver.Complete Book of the History of the Great Viet (Dai Viet Su Ky Toan Thu Â§ßË∂äÂè≤Ë®òÂÖ®Êõ∏) Vietnamese and Chinese miners had worked together in harmony until 1765, when two Chinese, Zhang Renfu and Zhang Nante, separated Chinese miners into different groups and contested to gain the control of Tong Tinh mines. Violent clashes erupted in 1765. Ngo Thi Si, governor of Thai Nguyen, did not respond to the conflict but appealed Qing government to come forward to resolve the problem because of the involvement of Chinese subjects. However, Qing officials did not know about the conflict and refused to intervene. Therefore, Ngo Thi Si led a mediation team to Tong Tinh mines to solve the problem but hurried back to the capital because of the death of Trinh Lord. Before leaving, Ngo reached a new tax-related agreement with Chinese miners and temporarily calmed the violent rebellion.Herr, J. C. (2017). 307-309 A more significant and influential disruption of Chinese miners happened in 1775, which was called the second Tong Tinh Mines Incident. In 1775, the Chinese miners of the silver factory split again into two groups, led by Zhang Deyu and Li Qiaoguang. Two groups of people came into conflict and interrupted the tax payment to the government of Thai Nguyen Province. Thai Nguyen government led the troops to quell the rebellion of the Tong Tinh mines successfully, and then took the leaders of rebellion to Thang Long, the capital of Le dynasty.Herr, J. C. (2017). 327 Qing government regarded it as a serious diplomatic event because, for this time, the conflict was between Chinese miners and Vietnamese troops. Under the direction of the Qianlong Emperor, Guangdong-Guangxi govern-general Li Shiyao closed the Youcun (Áî±Êùë) gateway, which was opened in 1744, and suspended the issuing of trans-border pass, which symbolized the abolishment of passport system established in 1744. Local officials of Qing dynasty strictly restricted the flow of people crossing the border, and trans-border trade was forbidden. The second Tong Tinh incident led to a trend of miners returning to China. According to the records of Qing She Lu, about 2,000 to 3,000 miners returned in 1775. The local government regarded returned miners as unstable factors in the border area, so that 63 people who involved in Tong Tinh incident were sent to Yili, Xinjiang, as punishment. 903 lesser offenders were sent to √úr√ºmqi to farm, and others returned to Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces according to their home location.Herr, J. C. (2017). 314-315 The return of Chinese miners was unexpected by the Vietnamese government. Even during the conflict, the Vietnamese government did not consider to expel a large number of Chinese miners. To respond to the returning trend, Le-Trinh government wrote to Qing officials for hoping Qing authorities to allow miners going back to Vietnam instead of sending them to their hometowns. Qing rejected such request and asked the Vietnamese government to return any illicit border crossers.Herr, J. C. (2017). 315-316 After Tong Tinh incident, in the late 1770s and 1780s, Trinh Lord continued to seek financial revenue in the border area. In the 1770s, another insurgency occurred in the Dulong mine in Lang Song province. Since there was no record of Chinese workers involved, Dulong incident didn't attract as much attention from historians as what Tong Tinh incident did. However, ongoing conflicts showed that Le-Trinh government lacked effective management of the mining industry in the border area.Herr, J. C. (2017). 329 Tay Son force defeated Le-Trinh army and occupied Thang Long in 1786. In 1788, the Qing government sent troops to Vietnam, trying to help Le to restore power but failed. Since then, the Qing government recognized the status of Tay Son regime and began to establish normal relations with it. The fall of Le-Trinh regime and the establishment of Tay Son changed Vietnamese border policy and brought a new period of Sino-Vietnamese relation. In 1792, the Qing government reopened the border and restored the passport system of 1744. Border trade and population movements picked up, and the mining industry in northern Vietnam also ushered in prosperity again. Even though experiencing the returning trend of Chinese miners, many silver and gold mines in Thai Nguyen, Tuyen Quang, and other provinces were still under the control of Chinese miners. Since living in Vietnam for many years, many Chinese miners and merchants formed relations with local people through trade and marriage. Some Chinese people, even after they returned, still considered Vietnam as their homeland.  Changes in the 19th century  Tong Tinh mine incidents in the 1770s and the civil war in 1780s changed the mining industry in northern Vietnam. After Nguyen Dynasty, the last dynasty in Vietnam history replaced Tay Son regime in 1802, Gia Long, the first emperor of Nguyen Dynasty, realized the importance of mining industry to Vietnamese economy and hoped to revitalize the mining industry. Unlike Le's encouraging privatization policy, Nguyen's approach was to strengthen government control and to prohibit private trade of metals. However, the consequence of tightened control was the loss of mining practitioners. In response to the lack of miners, Nguyen government reduced the taxes to stimulate the producing. In 1816, the court waived taxes for three mines: Nam Hoac iron mine in Thai Nguyen, S∆∞ Khong saltpeter mine in Son Tay, and the Mai Sao saltpeter mine in Lang Son. In 1821, Emperor Minh Menh, the successor of Gia Long, again ordered taxes to be waived for eight mines in Bac Thanh. In 1823, the court continued to waive taxes for mines producing gold, zinc, copper, and saltpeter due to the lack of mine owners and laborers.[ƒêNTL] Qu·ªëc s·ª≠ qu√°n tri·ªÅu Nguy·ªÖn [National history bureau of the Nguy·ªÖn court]. 2004. ƒê·∫°i Nam th·ª±c l·ª•c [Veritable records of ƒê·∫°i Nam].

However, prosperity brought by government incentives could not last long. The situation changed in 1831. According to Nguyen's policy, the mines, based on their scales, had to sell a certain amount of gold (or equivalent silver) to the government at a low price every year. While the market price was around 100 strings for 24-karat gold and 80 strings for 20-karat gold, the price that the government bought was 50 strings.Nguy·ªÖn Th·∫ø Anh. 2008.

In 1833, a team of about 8,000 people began to attack the capital of Thai Nguyen Province. The main group of attackers was the Chinese miners from neighboring mines, which led by Nong Van Van. In response to the uprising, Nguyen government announced the closure of all mines in the northern region.[ƒêNTL] 4:119 In the early days, the government did not successfully defend the rebel attacks. In August, the Nong Van Van's troop occupied the citadel of Cao Bang Province. In mid-October and early-November, a large rebel force pressed hard on the provincial citadel of Th√°i Nguy√™n. Chinese miners from Linh Nham mine participated in the battle in Thai Nguyen. At the end of 1833, the rebel was basically suppressed. Throughout 1834 and 1835, N√¥ng VƒÉn V√¢n, fled to the home of his second wife in Zhen'an prefecture, was pursued by Nguy·ªÖn troops. Thousands of Chinese miners participated in this rebellion, and afterward, they said that it was Nong Van Van and his subordinate forced them to involve. During and after Nong Van Van's uprising, miners and residents, both Chinese and Vietnamese, kept crossing the border into China to escape from the war.Lu√¢n, V. ƒê. (2015).

Because both sides of the conflict are Vietnamese, the Qing government refused to be involved in the conflict, even though the Qing army had gathered in the border area to prevent conflicts from spreading into Chinese territory. Qing refused to intervene militarily into areas under Nguy·ªÖn control that Chinese troops.[QSL] 1988. Qingshilu [Veritable records of the Qing dynasty].

Nominally, the failure of this uprising was a victory for the Nguyen court of controlling the mining in the northern uplands. In reality, the court's victory was short-lived. Through the rest of the 1830s, the total number of operative mines remained around 30 to 40. In 1840, out of twenty-seven gold mine sites in northern Vietnam, only nine were still in operation; the remaining eighteen sites had been sealed shut. Out of ten silver mine sites; only seven were still active, with three having been abandoned.[Hƒê] 4:273 Emperor Minh Menh continued to stimulate mining activities through direct management by the state. In his proposal, the state provided the capital, sent officials to the mines and hired the labors. However, these measures did not receive the expected results. After two attempts, the total amount of silver produced by the state-operated mines was only 8 taels, 7 coppers at the Tong Tinh mine and 10 taels, 5 coppers at the Nhan Son mine; the state had thus incurred a loss of over 100 strings in a short time.[Hƒê] 4:283 With such wretched results, Emperor Minh Menh ordered work to be stopped at both mines and returned them to receivership by private individuals again. The government later released restrictions on the operation of mines by individuals and local officials like mid-1700s. Minh Menh was forced to resume the old management model of receivership for tax collection. However, none of them played a role. The prosperity of the mining industry in northern Vietnam had passed. After half a century of war and chaotic management, the mining industry has been destined to decline.

It was published in July 2009 by Oxford University Press. The book tells the history of popular music from the introduction of the long-playing (LP) record in 1948. It focuses on key albums, from the Folkways compilation Anthology of American Folk Music (1952) to the White Stripes' Elephant (2003). Selection and sorting methodology Chris Smith previously wrote about music and popular culture for Rolling Stone, Billboard and MTV, among others, and authored The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History, published by Greenwood Press in 2006. In 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music, he focuses on albums and their impact on the cultural landscape, as opposed to songs and musical performance. In the book's preface, he says that, rather than looking to compile a list of the \\"best\\" albums, the criteria for inclusion was a combination of an album's sales performance and influence on American music and culture, together with the level of critical commentary it had inspired. He says that artists such as Chuck Berry, Bill Haley and Hank Williams, and many pioneers in the blues genre are necessarily excluded, since their most influential work was either confined to 78rpm singles or achieved through live performance. In Smith's opinion, Miles Davis is \\"the most revolutionary artist\\" in the book, while the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) is the album that most clearly satisfies the three criteria for inclusion. He comments that the featured albums show artistic ambition and influence in the areas of, variously, technological experimentation, mixing musical genres, presentation of alternate realities, and commentary on contemporaneous music ‚Äì the latter being demonstrated especially by the Mothers of Invention's Freak Out! (1966), which ridiculed \\"both the status quo and the counterculture\\". The book includes a timeline of key events in the history of recorded sound and divides the main discussion into seven chapters, starting with \\"The Birth of the Long Player, 1952‚Äì1962\\". The other six chapters cover the periods 1963‚Äì1967, 1968‚Äì1971, 1972‚Äì1976, 1977‚Äì1985, 1986‚Äì1990 and 1991‚Äì2008. Each of the featured albums is afforded two or three pages of text. Smith also includes appendices titled \\"Ten Albums That Almost Made It\\" and \\"Ten Important Producers\\". In the first of these, he comments that his omission of the Beatles' Revolver (1966) from the main body of the book is \\"somewhat unfair\\". Artists The following artists have albums featured in 101 Albums That Changed Popular Music: * 1952‚Äì1962: Elvis Presley, Miles Davis (2 entries), the Weavers, the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Ray Charles * 1963‚Äì1967: Bob Dylan (2 entries), the Beatles (3), the Byrds (2), the Mothers of Invention, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Jefferson Airplane, the Velvet Underground, the Jimi Hendrix Experience * 1968‚Äì1971: the Moody Blues, the Band, Led Zeppelin, MC5, the Who, King Crimson, Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band, James Taylor, Miles Davis, Black Sabbath, Carole King, Marvin Gaye, Sly and the Family Stone, Mahavishnu Orchestra * 1972‚Äì1976: David Bowie, Iggy and the Stooges, Pink Floyd, New York Dolls, Herbie Hancock, Kraftwerk, Linda Ronstadt, Aerosmith, Bruce Springsteen, Kiss, Patti Smith, Brian Eno, Queen, Waylon Jennings/Willie Nelson/Jessi Colter/Tompall Glaser, Parliament, the Ramones, Boston * 1977‚Äì1985: Bob Marley and the Wailers, Sex Pistols, Television, Pere Ubu, Van Halen, Funkadelic, Neil Young, the Clash, AC/DC, Michael Jackson, Herbie Hancock, Def Leppard, U2, R.E.M., Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, Metallica, Bruce Springsteen, Prince, H√ºsker D√º, Madonna * 1986‚Äì1990: Run-DMC, Paul Simon, Beastie Boys, Suzanne Vega, Guns N' Roses, Public Enemy, Sonic Youth, De La Soul, N.W.A, Nine Inch Nails, Uncle Tupelo, Garth Brooks * 1991‚Äì2008: Ice-T, Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tori Amos, Dr. Dre, Liz Phair, Wu-Tang Clan, Green Day, Ani DiFranco, Beck, Spice Girls, Dixie Chicks, Eminem, the White Stripes. In addition, the \\"Ten Albums That Almost Made It\\" appendix contains works by Ornette Coleman, James Brown, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, the Eagles, Pink Floyd, the Police, U2 and Alanis Morissette. Critical reception Eric Weisbard, the co-editor of Spin magazine's Alternative Record Guide and an organizer of the Experience Music Project conferences, wrote that, just as albums are \\"structures of order, turning songs, an inherently ersatz form, into statements\\", Smith's book \\"albums the album, compiling the 'statement' works that prevailed in jazz, folk, and two generations of rock into a single package\\". The Financial Times described Smith's 101 Albums as a \\"diverting\\" work that was \\"an upmarket version of the best-of lists that rock fans love to argue over\\". Express Milwaukees reviewer wrote: \\"Well argued, Smith compiles a history of rock that is generally correct and identifies such important trends as the fertile interplay between the Beatles and Dylan, the transmogrification of communal '60s folk-rock into me-only '70s singer-songwriter and the punk's reaction against hippy hypocrisy and pompous arena rock.\\" In his review for The Independent, Christopher Hirst admired Smith's writing and choice of suitable quotes. He said the inclusion of early albums such as Elvis Presley (1956), Muddy Waters at Newport (1960) and The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963) was logical, but \\"sometimes the wrong record is picked by the right artist\\" in the case of the Beatles' Rubber Soul (1965) and Davis' Bitches Brew (1970), which were chosen over Revolver and In a Silent Way (1969), respectively. Hirst also found the inclusion of Boston (1976) and Van Halen (1978) \\"inexplicable\\" and bemoaned the absence of Neil Young's After the Goldrush (1970) and the Allman Brothers Band's At Fillmore East (1971). Douglas Lord, in a review for Library Journal, said the coverage and detail was impressive and that the author \\"prov[es] a consummate music critic/historian\\". Lord also approved of the recognition afforded Television's Marquee Moon (1977), Metallica's Kill 'Em All (1983) and Public Enemy's It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back (1988), alongside the expected \\"classics\\" from the 1960s and 1970s. The website for the JW Pepper sheet music company describes the book as \\"A lively and provocative account\\" that \\"tells the fascinating stories behind the most groundbreaking, influential, and often controversial albums ever recorded\\".

Rulers of non-Chinese regimes would use the title of emperor (ÁöáÂ∏ù, or other equivalents) domestically and adopt the title of king (Áéã) when dealing with China. This system was applicable to Japan, Korea and Vietnam, among others. As China was a hegemonic power in East Asia for a large part of history, surrounding states were compelled to pay tribute to Chinese emperors in exchange for peace and political legitimacy. In this system, non-Chinese regimes accepted Chinese suzerainty and acknowledged the Chinese emperor as their nominal overlord. Since Chinese emperors claimed to be the Son of Heaven and held supremacy over all under Heaven, rulers of foreign regimes were to use titles subordinate to emperor. The same doctrine also maintained that there could only be one emperor at any given time.  Japan  Toyotomi Hideyoshi was triggered to invade Korea for the second time, after the Wanli Emperor of the Ming dynasty referred to him as the King of Japan. Chinese emperors originally referred to Japanese rulers as the King of Wa (ÂÄ≠Áéã). During the Sui dynasty, the Japanese diplomat Ono no Imoko delivered a letter by Prince Sh≈çtoku to the Emperor Yang of Sui which claimed the Empress Suiko as \\"the Son of Heaven where the sun rises\\", implying an equal status between the Japanese and Chinese monarchs. The Emperor Yang of Sui was angered by such a claim. Since then, the Emperor of Japan has started to use the title \\"tenn≈ç\\" (emperor) for both domestic and foreign countries, and the title \\"king\\" (ÂúãÁéã) was sometimes used for trade with China by Shogun, who was appointed by the Emperor of Japan, and influential person in the Imperial Court. China did not officially allow Japanese Emperors to use the title \\"tenn≈ç\\" (Â§©Áöá) which means emperor, but China could not stop Japanese Emperors from calling themselves emperor (Â§©Áöá). During the Tang dynasty, Japanese rulers were conferred the title King of Japan (Êó•Êú¨ÂúãÁéã). In 894, Japan abolished the Japanese envoys to Tang Dynasty China and ended the relationship with China, which used the title of king. During the Yuan dynasty, the Emperor Shizu of Yuan demanded the King of Japan to submit to him. In this instance, the King of Japan referred to the Japanese emperor. Japan rejected this demand, which led to Mongol invasion of Japan. During the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, Prince Kaneyoshi refused to accept the title of king granted by China, and killed seven Chinese ambassadors in retaliation. Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, a shogun in the 14th century, was given the title of \\"King of Japan\\" (Êó•Êú¨ÂúãÁéã) by Yongle Emperor because he needed to trade with the Ming dynasty.\\"Emperor Akihito steps down, marking the end of three-decade Heisei era\\"; Walter Sim Japan Correspondent; https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-emperor-to-step-down-today- in-first-abdication-for-two-centuriesThe Emperors of Modern Japan; edited by Ben-Ami Shillony; BRILL, 2008; page 1; https://books.google.com/books?id=FwztKKtQ_rAC&lpg;=PA1&pg;=PA1#v=onepage&q;&f;=falseThe Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family; By Sterling Seagrave, Peggy Seagrave; Broadway Books, 2001; Page 23; https://books.google.com/books?id=Se8UzqKr2x8C&lpg;=PA23&pg;=PA23#v=onepage&q;&f;=false Toyotomi Hideyoshi was enraged by being treated as a vassal by China, and planned to conquer the Ming Dynasty, causing Japanese invasions of Korea. During the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Hidetada changed the title of king to taikun (Â§ßÂêõ), as a sign of respect to the Japanese emperor. Thereafter, Tokugawa Ienobu switched the title back to king, only to be changed once again to taikun by Tokugawa Yoshimune.  Korea  The rulers of Balhae used imperial titles, such as Seongwang () and Hwangsang (), and had independent era names. In 933, Taejo of Goryeo was conferred the title of King of Goryeo (È´òÈ∫óÂúãÁéã) by the Emperor Mingzong of Later Tang. Prior to its capitulation to the Yuan dynasty, imperial designations and terminology were widely used by Goryeo domestically. Its rulers claimed to be the Son of Heaven, as did Chinese emperors. Gyeongsun of Silla addressed Taejo of Goryeo as the Son of Heaven when he capitulated. Even though the Song dynasty, Liao dynasty and Jin dynasty were well-informed of Goryeo's use of imperial titles, all three Chinese dynasties tolerated such practice. In 1270, Goryeo became a semi-autonomous region of the Mongol Empire, bringing an end to its imperial system. Its rulers bore the title king and were prohibited from having temple names which were reserved specifically for emperors. Gongmin of Goryeo declared independence from the Yuan dynasty in 1356. In 1392, Taejo of Joseon overthrew Goryeo and established a new dynasty on the Korean Peninsula. He was bestowed the title King of Joseon (ÊúùÈÆÆÂúãÁéã) by the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty. Both domestically and externally, rulers of Joseon held the title of king, unlike Goryeo's domestic use of imperial title.

Cornish) miners on their supervisor. was a mine superintendent in Moonta and Wallaroo, South Australia. He was noted for his business acumen and the respect with which he was held by both workers and mine owners. History Hancock was the third, and the eldest surviving, son of George Hancock (c. 1803 ‚Äì 22 February 1848), wheelwright and Wesleyan Methodist lay preacher and his wife Sarah Hancock, n√©e Lipson (c. 1799‚Äì ), who married on 1 June 1830 and lived in Horrabridge, near Tavistock, West Devon. He received a good education and at the age of sixteen began work at the nearby copper and tin mines, learning every aspect of their operation. In 1858 he was brought out to South Australia as superintendent of the Wheal Ellen, a small silver- lead and copper mine near Woodchester, South Australia, between Strathalbyn and Callington. It is reported that his abilities were noticed by (later Sir) Thomas Elder, who after that contract was over (c. January 1862), recommended to Hancock that he not return to England, but make his fortune in South Australia, sentiments echoed by Robert Barr Smith. By 1863 he was in charge of the assay office of the copper mine at Moonta, where a rich find had been made a few years earlier. He was then made surveyor, and made himself thoroughly conversant with the layout of the underground workings. In July 1864 he was made superintendent of Moonta Mines. Hancock and Captain William Arundel Paynter (1819‚Äì1873) invented and patented an improved \\"jigger\\" (a device employing water and agitation to separate ore from the lighter stuff). Their invention not only required less labor to operate, but wasted less copper- bearing ore, and as the Hancock jig was in use worldwide for many years. When the richest ore had been mined and there was much talk of closing the mines at Moonta and nearby Wallaroo, Hancock was put in charge of both operations, and by diligent management kept both operational. When he retired, to be replaced by his son H. Lipson Hancock JP, he had been superintendent of the one for 34 years and the other for 22. He retired in August 1898 and left Moonta the following October, when he and Mrs Hancock were accorded an elaborate farewell. Their home \\"Ivymeade\\" in Burnside was advertised for sale in 1902, and became the residence of Dr. Alfred Edward James Russell, who died there in 1905. It was again advertised in 1907. Captain Hancock died there, as did his wife Loveday Hancock, after which it was finally sold by auction in 1934, to Captain W. B. White.

He is best known as the assistant administrator of public affairs for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington, D.C., from 1962 to 1971. Early life Julian Weisel Scheer was born in Richmond, Virginia, on January 26, 1926, the son of Hilda Knopf and George Fabian Scheer. During World War II he joined the United States Merchant Marine at the age of 17, and served in the Atlantic and Pacific. After the war he entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), from which he graduated in 1950 with a degree in a journalism and communications. While there, he was a spokesman for UNC's sports program. On graduation, Scheer became an assistant to Jack Wade, the Director of Sports Information at UNC. In 1953, he became a journalist at the local Charlotte, North Carolina, newspaper, The Charlotte News, where he mainly covered sports stories. In 1954 he was part of the media contingent that covered Hurricane Hazel. A photograph of Scheer struggling against the high winds and rising waters earned Charlotte News photographer Hugh Morton an award for Southern Press Photographer of the Year. In 1956, Scheer accepted an invitation from Nelson Benton, a fellow UNC graduate who worked for the WBTV Channel 3 News, to visit Patrick Air Force Base in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where the United States Air Force was testing rockets and missiles. Scheer was fascinated by what he saw, but his editor did not think it was newsworthy. Scheer then returned to the Cape on his own time and dime to watch more missile launches, and wrote a series of articles on the work being done there. After the space race began in the late 1950s, the subject became of great interest to the public, and Scheer teamed up with NASA engineer Theodore J. Gordon to write a bestseller on the subject, First into Outer Space. It was his third book, after Choo Choo: The Charlie Justice Story (1958), a biography of American football player Charlie Justice, written with Hugh Morton and Bob Quincy, and Tweetsie, the Blue Ridge Stemwinder (1958), a history of the East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad, written with Elizabeth Black. NASA Neil Armstrong steps onto the lunar surface Scheer covered the 1960 presidential election for his newspaper, and got to know Robert F. Kennedy. In 1962, Scheer had begun writing a novel on the civil rights movement when he was contacted by James Webb, the administrator of NASA, who asked him to come to NASA headquarters in Washington, D.C., and develop a plan for coordinating media coverage of the space program. Scheer therefore began working for NASA as a consultant. In early 1963 he became NASA's assistant administrator for public affairs. In his new role, Scheer soon clashed with Shorty Powers, NASA's public affairs officer. Powers refused to give out the flight plan of upcoming missions, but gave the plan for Gordon Cooper's Mercury-Atlas 9 flight to journalist Jay Barbree for a bottle of Jim Beam. Scheer confronted Powers over this, and ordered him to send out copies to all the news media. When Powers threatened to resign, Scheer accepted his resignation. Henceforth, NASA would make information freely available, not because it felt that it was under any legal obligation to do so, but because it was good policy to do so. Scheer was capable of withholding information; in the wake of the Apollo 1 fire he refused to issue any statement until the families of the three astronauts had been informed of their deaths. Scheer was responsible for naming the Apollo 11 Command Module Columbia, and was involved in discussions about the lunar flag-raising ceremony, and the words on the plaque left on the Moon, successfully resisting pressure from President Richard Nixon to include mention of God. But perhaps his greatest achievement was overruling the engineers who wanted to minimise the weight carried on board the Lunar Module Eagle and insist that a television camera be taken. As a result, millions were able to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walk on the Moon. Later life Scheer left NASA on February 22, 1971, to become the campaign manager of Terry Sanford‚Äôs unsuccessful candidacy in the 1972 presidential election. He remained engaged with the space program as a consultant and a trustee of the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum. He worked for a Washington communications consulting firm until 1976, when he became a vice- president of Ling-Temco-Vought (LTV), in charge of its Washington operations. He was LTV's public face during the Reagan administration antitrust suit against it, and later during its bankruptcy and subsequent reorganisation, and an unfavorable United States Supreme Court ruling. He became a consultant again in 1992. In the early 1990s, Scheer became involved in environmental causes, and was a key strategist in Piedmont Environmental Council's struggle with Disney's America. He became a co-founder of Protect Historic America, a group that marshalled opposition to Disney's America from popular historians like David McCullough and Shelby Foote. On September 1, 2001, Scheer suffered a heart attack while riding a tractor at his cattle ranch in Catlett, Virginia, where he had lived since 1965, and died. He was survived by Suzanne Huggan, his second wife of 36 years, two sons children and a daughter from his first marriage to Virginia Williams, which ended in divorce, and a daughter from his second marriage.

The title alludes to Bach's Goldberg Variations, which is also used as background music. The play is set in Jerusalem and presents a disastrous rehearsal of a theatrical production based on the Old and New Testaments, directed by Mr. Jay, a god-like figure. His assistant is Goldberg, a Jew who has escaped from the Nazis. Plot points include Creation, the fall of man, the binding of Isaac, the golden calf, and the Crucifixion, all presented with a satirical combination of seriousness and farce.  History  Tabori wrote the play in English, and it was translated by Ursula Gr√ºtzmacher-Tabori. The premiere at the Akademietheater in Vienna on 22 June 1991 was directed by the author, with Gert Voss as Mr. Jay and Ignaz Kirchner as Goldberg. The actors were awarded the Actor Duo of the Year (Schauspielerpaar des Jahres) prize by the trade magazine Theater heute in 1991 for their performance. The play was published by Kiepenheuer. It received further stagings: Ingmar Bergman directed it at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm in 1994, using Bach's variations and hard rock. A 2008 production by the Berliner Ensemble by , with Dieter Mann and , was still compared to the first performance.  Plot  In Jerusalem, Mr. Jay leads the rehearsal of a play which enacts scenes from the Old Testament in its first part, and from the New Testament after the intermission. Goldberg, a Jew who survived the Holocaust, is his assistant. The production, which Feinberg notes as an outstanding example of mise en abyme, presents \\"a series of disasters throughout the history of mankind where God has decided not to intervene\\". These scenes include Creation, the fall of man, the binding of Isaac, the golden calf, and the Crucifixion. The dialogue is liberally laced with direct quotes and allusions to verses from Scripture and lines from Shakespeare and Milton. Everything goes wrong in the rehearsal and Mr. Jay is thoroughly dissatisfied with it. Mr. Jay has been identified with God, and also with Tabori. The play explores the relationship between Mr. Jay and Goldberg on several levels, with irony and bitter seriousness. The two antagonists depict the relationship between God and man, also father and son, victimizer and victim, antisemitic figure and Jew.

The House Un-American Activities Committee, supported at times by military authorities, inspected public school and college textbooks and curricula to ensure that the authors, even those long deceased, had 'disclaimed Communism'.

Nevertheless, when she refused to answer part of the Superintendent's question concerning past and present membership in the CP, she was first suspended from her teaching position, and after twelve years as a teacher, was dismissed, with 38 other NYC teachers, in April 1954 for ‚Äúinsubordination and conduct unbecoming‚Äù and the Board of Education's determination, in accordance with New York State's Feinberg Law, that she had not satisfactorily severed her ties to the Communist Party. 283 others resigned or retired to escape the ordeal, with one elementary teacher, recently bereaved of her husband, committing suicide. Grossman's 1955 appeal against her dismissal was denied by the State Commissioner of Education. Recognition for photography In the same year, two of Grossman's photographs appeared in the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man selected by Edward Steichen and seen by 9 million visitors. One shows an elderly couple promenading on a city street, their identical poses representing habituation in a long-term marriage.

Barred from teaching but buoyed by this recognition, Grossman switched careers to begin freelancing as a photographer, working for the New York Hotel Trades Council, and for the Hotel Workers Local #6 in NYC, photographing their members on the job, as they participated in union elections, on the strike line, and at the Union hall. Her now historic pictures appeared in Union publications and displayed in her art exhibit Portrait of a Union. Mildred Grossman, NYC Teachers' Union Member, Photographer for the New York Hotel Trades Council: Online exhibition at The New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, AFL-CIO, (Hotel Trades Council) site She met Dr Martin Luther King in the union offices in 1957 and in support of civil rights she produced reportage on the Little Rock Nine, the first African-American students to attend an integrated school, Little Rock Central High, in Arkansas in September, 1957, as part of the initiative to desegregate Southern schools. Subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence by their white classmates, they became iconic of African-Americans‚Äô struggle for equality. Grossman photographed them in the summer of 1958, when they met with union leaders, diplomats, and elected officials honouring their courage and achievements.Mildred Grossman Collection online at the Albin O.

In 1958 Grossman married Motel \\"Mark\\" Berkowitz, a Holocaust survivor with whom, in 1965, she traveled to Poland, his homeland. The next year she won a Polish competition with her image Strike Rally. She had previously, in 1960, won 'America's Many Faces', sponsored by the National Urban League. She photographed for the Poor People's Campaign in 1968 and contributed photos to The New Movement: Power for the Powerless. In 1967 the Feinberg Law was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and Grossman led a group of teachers to seek reinstatement, but it was not until 1972 that they successfully sued to regain their jobs. In the meantime, during 1971 Grossman worked between freelance photography, social work and teaching photography, before finally, at age 58, returning after 21 years to her secondary teaching post at Central Commercial High School in 1974-75, her hard-won campaign against laws obstructing academic freedom vindicated. Even in her sixties, she fought for others as head of the tenant union in her building.Mildred Grossman papers at the Albin O.

History The monastery is located in a large cave in a sheer cliff, where the western slopes of Mount Chelmos drop down to the gorge of the Vouraikos river, some northwest of the town of Kalavryta. The cave was known in antiquity, and the geographer Pausanias reports that the daughters of Proetus found refuge there during their madness. In the first Christian centuries, Christian hermits occupied the cave. According to tradition, the monastery is one of the oldest in Greece, reputedly founded in 362 by the Thessalonian brothers Symeon and Theodore, who with the help of Euphrosyne (a local shepherdess, honoured as saint for her part in these events) discovered in the cave the icon of the Theotokos painted by Luke the Evangelist. Its medieval history under Byzantine and Latin rule is obscure. The monastery gained prominence only from about 1354, when it served as the residence of the Orthodox Metropolitan of Patras, since the city was still occupied by the Latins and the seat of a Latin archbishopric. The complex suffered large-scale destructions in 849, 1400, and 1640, when it was comprehensively rebuilt. Several of the monks became members of the Filiki Etaireia and took part in the Greek War of Independence. In 1934, the katholikon was destroyed in a fire, and replaced by a new church in 1937. On 8 December 1943, the German 117th J√§ger Division destroyed the monastery and executed 22 monks and visitors as part of reprisals that culminated a few days later with the Massacre of Kalavryta. The monastery was rebuilt from the ground after the war, and now comprises an eight-storey complex set in the high cliff face. A male monastery, it celebrates on 15 August (the day of the Dormition), 14 September, and 18 October (Luke the Evangelist and the ktetors).

Sabino was also accused committing numerous crimes such as theft, robbery and rape. Sabino was described as a short, shallow man of frightened and introverted look, with features reminiscent of the autistic spectrum due to his lack of reaction to a firearm discharge from a nearby officer at the time of his capture.The story of the \\"Monster of Capin√≥polis\\" wins book Accessed on July 24, 2016 There are many theories that point at Brazil's Military Dictatorship which took place in the years Sabino was active, holding the government responsible for this crimes, which would have been done for political reasons. These theories have never been confirmed. Sabino was considered a symbolic figure in local folklore at the time of his activities, as many people thought he was endowed with supernatural abilities because of his insight, strength and his level of dangerousness.  Life  Little is known about Sabino's life prior to his criminal activities, since he was the source of information about his origins. Orlando Sabino Camargo is said to have been born in Arapongas, in a furniture shop in northern Paran√°, on September 4th, 1946. Son of farmer couple Jorge Francisco and Benedita Rodrigues, he was the oldest of seven children. Sabino ran away from home to work in another farm in his early twenties, after witnessing his father's boss murder Jorge Francisco. When Orlando returned home, his family was nowhere to be found and so Sabino became a drifter.  Crimes and Capture  After traveling for miles, he arrived at the Alto Parana√≠ba region, where he was accused of practicing robbery in the region of Arax√° and murder in Patroc√≠nio and Coromandel in late 1971. Sabino then travelled to the southern area of Minas Gerais, where he allegedly committed homicides in Davin√≥polis and Ouvidor‚Äôs outskirts, before heading to Tupaciguara, Centralina, Capin√≥polis and Can√°polis. Sabino was known for invading farms and spending long periods free of human contact, sneaking through the vegetation. Around 300 men were part of his manhunt, from military and civil police officers, cavalry, agents of Brazil's then active Department of Political and Social Order (DOPS), detectives, Army officers; all of which were helped by armed volunteers, farmers and hunters. Numbers, nonetheless, are exaggerated. > Army troops [which] are manoeuvring in the Chanel of S√£o Sim√£o, Cemig's and > FAB's helicopters, besides new reinforcements of PMMG's detection dogs will > be deployed today in pursuit of the madman spreading panic in the region of > Ituitaba, after killing 25 people - 13 in Minas [Gerais] and 12 in Goi√°s. > [...] starting today [the police operation] will have helicopters and over > 180 Army soldiers, increasing numbers to over a thousand participants in the > manhunt. While the police and Army laid siege to capture the Monster of Capin√≥polis, rural population lived in panic: farms were abandoned, the rice harvest was delayed; a small rural exodus happened since many started looking for cities' safety, which also caused a supply crisis and extra costs for municipal administrations. Operation's headquarters, Capin√≥polis' municipality almost went bankrupt. Orlando was eventually captured in Ipia√ßu, on the banks of the Tejuco River in March 10th 1972, after seventeen days of persecution; the largest manhunt ever held in the state, with over two hundred policemen on patrol. After being arrested, a filthy Sabino was displayed in public squares to the local population, in each town he had committed crimes; where he would also be judged by those crimes. During questioning in Tupaciguara in March 20th 1972, Orlando confessed to have murdered Antenor Louren√ßo and In√™s Fernandes dos Santos. According to the attorney M√°rio Jos√© de Faria, Orlando detailed the murders and thefts by him committed, however, Faria stated that \\"If you asked if he had built Bras√≠lia, he'd say yes; if he had bombed Hiroshima, he answered he did. So I urged the judge for [Orlando's] sanity to be examined, urgent.\\" Faria also stated \\"We stood before a criminally irresponsible being, a being who killed; a psychopath.\\" In April 27th 1972, Sabino was taken to the Penitentiary Ant√¥nio Dutra Ladeira, in Ribeir√£o das Neves, near the capital Belo Horizonte.  Aftermath  In May 29th 1972, judge Jos√© Affonso da Costa Cortes ruled Orlando Sabino was to hospitalized in an asylum: > [...] the accused presented [...] accentuated indications of dangerousness, > fact, we believe, that cannot be contested in any way. [...] Considering the > provisional application of this measure not possible, including in the > developing of the police investigation [...], [I] determine that the accused > shall be committed [...], in order to be submitted to medical examinations, > for the verification of article 22 of the Penal Code's disposition. The judge of Coromandel would rule the same, and Orlando would be submitted to examinations in August 27th 1973. Orlando was diagnosed with an intellectual disability, absolved from his crimes in 1977 and placed under security measures. Orlando's case was studied by researchers and exemplifies problems with the Brazilian juridical system at the time, since the same defendant was judged in different municipalities which had poor communication between each jurisdiction. This was evidenced when Orlando was absolved for the murder of Opr√≠nio Ismael de Nascimento in 1994, due to lack of a murder weapon, 22 years after the crime. In October 6th 2008, the judge of Patroc√≠nio ruled Sabino's sentence extinct. Still, Coromandel's late verification would prompt Orlando's release to be postponed to August 31st 2009, after completing his 38 years and 6 months sentence in the Judicial Hospital Professor Mario Vaz. On April 1, 2011, he was admitted to an almshouse for the elderly.  Death  Sabino was found dead on the morning of June 8th, 2013, in the almshouse he had been admitted two years before, in Barbacena, by one of the staff. The cause of death was identified as a heart attack. Orlando Sabino is buried in Santo Ant√¥nio Cemetery in Barbacena.  Documentary  Despite the great controversy surrounding Orlando Sabino - where many claim that he was a murderous monster and others claim that he only the victim of the Military Regime - the newspaper Todo Em Dia produced a documentary based on the book \\"The Monster of Capin√≥polis\\" by journalist Pedro Pop√≥.

It is one of four villas in Walkerburn designed by Frederick Thomas Pilkington between 1867-69 for the Ballantyne family. It is listed as a fine example of a Pilkington mansion retaining original external features, a fine interior, and for its importance as a Ballantyne property. The Ballantyne family played a leading role in Scotland's textile industry for nearly two hundred years. The Ballantynes were substantially responsible for founding the village of Walkerburn after Henry Ballantyne first bought land at that location to build a tweed mill in 1846. Renowned architect F T Pilkington was commissioned by the Ballantynes to design and build the new village with houses for the mill workers, The Kirna, and other villas for the Ballantyne family. The Kirna's proximity to a significant number of ancient man-made structures, including some dating back to pre-historic times, suggests that this general location along the Tweed valley has been of strategic importance to settlers throughout history. Main entrance, The Kirna Design & Architecture Dining Room, The Kirna (2018) Staircase, The Kirna (2018) Staircase finial, The Kirna (2018) The Kirna retains all of its original 1867 Scots Baronial and Venetian Romanesque design features including an idiosyncratic tower in Ruskinian Gothic style. The heavy oak main staircase features distinctive turned and carved balusters also found in F T Pilkington's own house, Egremont, 38 Dick Place, Edinburgh, and grotesque finials holding shields sporting the initials of George Ballantyne and his wife Marion White Aitken (1841-1914). The dining room ceiling incorporates the initials of Colin Ballantyne and his wife Isabella Milne Welsh (1881-1969), respectively. Of special architectural note is the main entrance and heavily decorated (sculpted) elevation featuring a central flight of ashlar steps leading to a polygonal, arcaded loggia entrance area which is supported by two rope-moulded arches. Immediately above the entrance is the first floor with prominent chequered detail between the band courses, and a repeat of the rope moulding around the windows. The second floor features a turret with two finialled dormers. The Kirna shares many of these design elements with another F T Pilkington building originally known as Craigend Park in Edinburgh, designed and built for William Christie between 1866 and 1869, a \\"Glover and Breeches Maker\\" (tailor) at 16 George Street who is believed to have sourced much of his material from the Ballantyne mills. Designs of The Kirna were exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1867. The subsequent review in The Builder noted that \\"Pilkington is never commonplace, though frequently wild and eccentric\\". The Kirna was praised as \\"a pleasing example of the modern style Gothic as applied to domestic purposes: abundance of light is given, and variety is secured without violent contrast\\". Drawings of alterations dated 1903 by James Jerdan (architect at 12 Castle Street, Edinburgh), indicate the addition of a coal chute and \\"heating chamber\\" area located beside the main building. An innovative tunnel from the heating chamber to the basement area permitted staff to transport coal to the core of the house without disturbing the proprietor. The 1903 alterations included the addition of a 'boudoir' (now game room) to the west gable, and a bedroom on the first floor. The boundary wall and a glass house still survive. The entrance gates were likely removed during the war in 1941 when the government passed an order compulsorily requisitioning all post-1850 iron gates and railings for the war effort. History=Ownership= Genealogical Tree of Henry Ballantyne Family The Kirna was built in 1867 for George Ballantyne (1836-1924), third son of Henry Ballantyne (1802-1865). George acquired the site from Alexander Horsburgh of Horsburgh in 1867 after having built the boundary walls, driveway, and some or all of the house. The deed explicitly provided for George to draw his domestic water from the Kirna Burn until such time as a reservoir was constructed to supply the Estate of Pirn, and to source stone from Purveshill quarries. He and his family owned and occupied The Kirna between 1867 and 1880 when, curiously, he sold the property to his brother David Ballantyne (1825-1912). Marian Currie (1830-1903, n√©e Upwood), widow of Charles Currie (1829-1878, son of Sir Frederick Currie, 1st Baronet), acquired the property in 1888 and remained at The Kirna until she died in 1903 and the property was sold to Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Hamilton Bruce (1863-1928), widow of Robert Hamilton Bruce (1846-1899), a successful Glasgow businessman, and daughter of Simon Somerville (Tae) Laurie (1829-1909), a Scottish educator. Kitty owned The Kirna for sixteen years before selling to Colin Ballantyne (1879-1942), son of John Ballantyne (1829-1909), in 1919. Colin Ballantyne continued to own the property until just before his death in 1942. He was the third and final member of the Ballantyne family to have owned The Kirna. Between 1941 and 1992 The Kirna was owned by respectively Emily Skinner ('41-48), James Forbes ('48-53), Winnifred and Henry Pearson Taylor Smith ('53-57), Peter Rodger ('57-59), James Fraser ('59-81), John Rapley ('81-91), and briefly by Peter Hammond ('91-92). The Kirna, aerial view (1990s) Julian Osborne, solicitor, purchased The Kirna in 1992. It was acquired by the Facey family in 2018. =George, The Kirna, and New Zealand= For Sale advertisement, The Scotsman April 15, 1871 Between 1870 and 1872 George secured two personal loans amounting to ¬£800 (¬£95,000 in 2019) using The Kirna as collateral, suggesting that he may have been facing financial difficulties. George advertised The Kirna for sale in April of 1871 after the death of his three-year-old son Henry George Tait, and when it did not sell he advertised it to let, furnished, by the year. In 1874 he mortgaged The Kirna for ¬£1,000 (¬£120,000 in 2019) and used a portion of the proceeds to repay ¬£500 of his outstanding personal loans. In 1878 The Kirna was put up for auction in Peebles but it did not sell. The remainder of his personal loan amount was repaid in 1879. George sold The Kirna to his brother David for ¬£2,100 (¬£250,000 in 2019) when he emigrated to New Zealand in 1880, notionally to enter the wool-buying business to supply the requirements of Henry Ballantyne's mills. David already owned a property (Sunnybrae) in Walkerburn at that time, suggesting that his purchase of The Kirna was designed to facilitate George's departure and possibly his exit from Henry Ballantyne's business. George used the proceeds of the sale to discharge his ¬£1,000 mortgage. David let The Kirna, fully furnished, until 1888 when he auctioned off the furniture and sold the property. Not long after his arrival in New Zealand, and despite his original mandate, George accepted a position as manager of the newly-formed Oamaru Woollen Factory Company in 1881. He went to Britain and selected the plant for the new factory, had the plans for the mill drawn up, and engaged key staff. He was dismissed in May 1883 for performance reasons and put up for auction 1000 of his shares in the factory in May of 1884. George is also known to have held a management role at the North New Zealand Woollen Manufacturing Company in Onehunga, Auckland in 1886. There is no record of George engaging with Henry Ballantyne's mills after 1881. George died in 1924 in New Zealand. His estate was valued at ¬£120 (¬£7,000 in 2019). =Coach House= The Kirna was built in 1867 with a separate stable block and coach house rather than a traditional entrance lodge. In 1923, architect William James Walker Todd made alterations to the stable and coach house for Colin Ballantyne, including converting a section of the stable to a (second) bedroom and a bathroom. The Kirna and the coach house were formally separated in 1948 when Emily Skinner sold The Kirna to James Forbes who immediately sold the coach house to William Johnson, an architect from Edinburgh. =Property Name= 1654 Blaeu Atlas Map of Innerleithen area showing 'Kirn' At various times The Kirna has also been referred to as Kirnie House or Kirna House. All three names are an obvious connection to its location at the base of Kirnie Law hill and to nearby Kirnie Tower (see below). Ordnance Survey historical maps published in 1897, 1898 and 1909 record the property as Kirnie House. Between 1903 and 1919 before it was sold to Colin Ballantyne, The Kirna was known as Grangehill. The owner at that time, Katherine Hamilton Bruce, is known to have resided at The Grange in Dornoch and at Grange Dell in Penicuik, demonstrating a predilection for names including 'Grange'. The current name, Kirna House, may have come about when the Post Office needed to be able to distinguish between the villa and the coach house (now Kirna Lodge) when the latter was sold as a separate property in 1948. =Kirna 'Firsts'= In approximately 1907, Katherine Hamilton Bruce was the first proprietor of The Kirna (then Grangehill) to have enjoyed a magneto telephone mounted on the wall out of sight in the pantry. The telephone would likely have been an NTC No. 1 (a.k.a. GPO No. 59) based on the first-hand account of Catherine Ann Hamilton Bruce (1895-1978, daughter of Kitty). When Colin Ballantyne acquired the house in 1919 his subscriber number was 16 and he could reach his mother at Stoneyhill on number 12, his brother John King Ballantyne at Nether Caberston on number 3, his cousin John Alexander at Sunnybrae on number 14, and the Walkerburn Co-operative Society on number 4, amongst others. The first telephones were installed in Walkerburn in 1891 and by the 1920s the village had approximately ten telephone subscribers, likely connected by a small manual exchange tended by a caretaker operator. At some time prior to 1878 the house was tied in to the Peebles (Eshiels) gas works and some or all of the fireplaces at The Kirna we converted to gas-fired. The first gas street lamps were installed in Walkerburn in 1878. Central heating was first installed in approximately 1993. The Kirna was originally designed and built with nine open fireplaces. The alterations of 1903 added a further four fireplaces and an oil-fired hot water boiler in the newly constructed \\"heating chamber\\". Location Locations of Ballantyne Villas in Walkerburn The Kirna is situated on Peebles Road (A72), originally Pink Bank, in the valley of the River Tweed, a few hundred meters west of Walkerburn village. Peebles Road was the turnpike road between Galashiels and Peebles which was constructed in circa 1775. The property is unusual as it stands away from the other three Ballantyne family houses designed by F T Pilkington in Walkerburn (John Ballantyne's house Stoneyhill, David's house Sunnybrae and Henry's former home Tweedvale) but exhibits features found on the other buildings. Other Ballantyne villas in the vicinity during this era included Holylee owned by Major James George Ballantyne (1837-1884), and The Firs (Horsbrugh Terrace, Innerleithen) owned by James Ballantyne (1839-1903). The Kirna is in close proximity to almost a dozen man-made structures, some dating back to pre-historic times, illustrating the strategic importance of this location to settlers throughout history. The site and surrounding lands benefit from ample supplies of fresh water from the Kirna Burn and the Walker Burn, its elevation above the flood plain of the Tweed River, extensive views up and down the Tweed Valley, the south-facing slope of Kirnie Law, and a rich topsoil. Mid-19th century maps indicate an old whinstone quarry approximately 30 meters beyond the northwest corner of the boundary wall and in the path of the Kirna Burn that travels along the west boundary wall from Kirnie Law to the Tweed river. Nearby Historic Structures=Kirna Burn Water Tank= Storage tank on Kirna Burn Cistern for The Kirna A for sale advertisement in The Scotsman published on April 15, 1871 cites \\"an abundance of beautiful spring water\\" to The Kirna. It is likely that the water tank positioned upstream from The Kirna on Kirna Burn provided that source of fresh water from 1867 until at least 1961 despite local authorities being required by law to provide water to communities from the 1940s. This tank functioned as an intake for some of Walkerburn and also supplied The Kirna via a dedicated cistern tank visible just beyond the northern perimeter wall. =Kirnie Law Reservoir= Kirnie Law Reservoir The Kirna is due south of Kirnie Law Reservoir which was built to provide hydro- electric power for Tweedvale Mill and Tweedholm Mill in Walkerburn, owned by Henry Ballantyne & Sons, Ltd. The project was conceived of and designed by Boving & Co. Ltd. (hydraulic engineers) and became operational in 1922. This was the first working hydro-electric power scheme in the country. The reservoir continued in use until around 1950. The ferro-concrete reservoir is still substantially intact. Its interior measures 58.5 meters squared by 4.7 meters deep and the walls are 20 centimeters at the top tapering to 35 centimeters at the base. The tank was capable of holding 13.2 million liters of water. There is a surge tank (pumping station) downhill that controlled the water flow to the turbines in the valley. =Prehistoric Enclosure= Located approximately 270 meters NW of The Kirna is a prehistoric enclosure (settlement). It is recorded as an 'ancient monument forming part of the lands of Caberston' under the Ancient Monuments Act, 1931. The settlement has been mostly destroyed by cultivation, stone-robbing, and the construction of a semi-circular sheepfold, now in ruins. However, sufficient remains to show that it measured about 50 meters N-S by slightly less transversely, and that it was originally enclosed by a wall. =Ancient Terraces and Tower= Ancient terraces The remains of ancient terraces and Purvishill Tower are located approximately 200 meters due west of The Kirna at the base of Purvis Hill. Although they are technically of unknown origin, it is believed that the terraces belong to the Pictish period (600-700AD). Given their unusual scale, character and location, the terraces may have been intended to provide level ground for gardens or orchards, although a more utilitarian agricultural function is also possible. =Kirnie Tower= Approximately 80 meters to the south of The Kirna, across the A72, is the site of Kirnie Tower. Its site was pointed out in 1856 by residents of Walkerburn who were present at its removal in circa 1840 when its stones were removed for building purposes elsewhere on the Horsburgh estate. Long after its dismantlement it was used as a shepherd's hut. Maps published as far back as 1654 refer to \\"Kirn\\" or \\"Kirna\\" in approximately the location of Kirnie Tower. Ordnance Survey Name Books in the mid-1800s record the structure as \\"one of the ancient feudal residences erected for the protection of the Borders. It was square in appearance\\". A series of these peel towers was built in the 15th century along the Tweed valley from its source to Berwick, as early-warning beacons announcing invasion from the Marches. =Romano-British Settlement= A scooped homestead, measuring 26x23 meters internally, is situated on the steep SW face of Purvis Hill, approximately 200 meters north of The Kirna. The enclosing wall has been largely lost, but the position of the entrance is still visible. Within the walls is a platform large enough to support two timber houses. =Kirnie Cottage= Kirnie Cottage Ordnance Survey Name Books for the parish of Innerleithen written prior to the construction of The Kirna cite a \\"one storey house\\" named Kirnie, property of the Horsburgh family, situated at or near the current site of The Kirna. It is believed that the house started life as the shepherd's cottage for Pirn House (demolished in early 1950s) and was built by Stirling & Son of Galashiels when they were building the mill houses in Walkerburn for \\"Captain\\" Horsburgh. 1841, 1851 and 1861 Census data refer to a shepherd named James Tait and his family living at Kirna (or Kirnie). The cottage has also been variously tagged as Kirna or Kirnie Toll House, however this seems unlikely given the nearby turnpike toll house (est. 1830) in Innerleithen. Kirnie Cottage was notoriously put up for sale in 2011 by a squatter who tried to sell the cottage for ¬£70,000 without the knowledge of the owner. =Kirna Lodge= Kirna Lodge Kirna Lodge is located within the original boundary walls of The Kirna. It started life as the stable and coach house for The Kirna. Today, Kirna Lodge is a three- bedroom house overlooking the Tweed Valley, with a conservatory and a four-car garage. The kitchen is now in what used to be the stable in 1923. The original coach house has made way for a principal bedroom and, more recently, a general purpose room. The lodge exhibits a flush bracket (OSBM G293) that was used during the Second Geodetic Leveling of Scotland that took place between 1936 and 1952, and was leveled with a height of 157.0421 meters above mean sea level. This bracket was included on the Innerleithen to Duns Common leveling line.

BBC Showcase/Catch-Up and BBC Learning are removed from the venture, and launch the following year as BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge respectively. The proposed TV version of Radio 1 eventually launches as a music and comedy channel called UK Play but with no connection to Radio 1, and plans for the sports channel come to nothing. *9 November ‚Äì At 6.00 pm, BBC News 24 is launched. It is the BBC's first new UK channel since BBC Two in 1964. It is only available full time via cable. =1998= *10 June ‚Äì The BBC switches on its digital signal, doing so to coincide with the start of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.

Branded CBBC on Choice, children's programming is broadcast on the channel every day from 6am until 7pm. 2000s=2000= *June ‚Äì BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge are reformatted to focus on more specific audiences. Knowledge adopts a broader documentary and culture mix and Choice focusing on developing a stronger relationship with the young adult audience, an audience the BBC had historically had difficulty in reaching. Many of its original programmes, such as Backstage, were replaced with shows aimed at younger people, with most of the early part of the schedules being made up of fifteen-minute programmes under the banner of \\"Refreshing TV\\" or \\"Micro TV\\". Entertainment news magazine \\"Liquid News\\", presented by Christopher Price, evolved out of News 24's \\"Zero 30\\" and became the channel's flagship show. *2 October ‚Äì Rather than continuing to broadcast its own breakfast news programme, BBC News 24 begins to simulcast BBC One's breakfast programme, which on this day is revamped and relaunched as BBC Breakfast. *6 August ‚Äì It is reported that the BBC is considering a reorganisation of their digital channels to replace BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge with BBC Three and BBC Four. *14 November BBC Parliament's audio feed on DAB is closed down. =2001= *BBC Choice's national late night outputs are abandoned ‚Äì BBC Choice Northern Ireland closes on 30 March. *16 July ‚Äì A one-minute news summary called 60 Seconds launches on BBC Choice. *October ‚Äì BBC Choice is further tilted towards youth programming, showcasing the kind of content that will be shown on BBC Three. *19 November ‚Äì The BBC announces details of two forthcoming digital channels for children to be launched in Spring 2002.

The play was originally written in 1986, but shelved by the BBC because of an upcoming general election, and the play's perceived pro-Thatcher stance. The play has separate radio and television versions (airing on Radio 4 on 6 April), and gives BBC Four an audience of 174,000, the channel's highest audience since its launch. *3 June ‚Äì BBC Parliament broadcasts archived programming for the first time when it reruns the BBC's coverage of the Queen's Coronation as part of the Golden Jubilee Weekend. *7 September ‚Äì Following the success of its rerun of the BBC's coverage of the Queen's Coronation, BBC Parliament replays coverage of archive BBC general election coverage for the first time.

A large number of studies shows that Vietnam is experiencing climate change and will be severely negatively affected in coming decades. These negative effects include sea level rise, salinity intrusion and other hydrological problems like flood, river mouth evolution, sedimentation as well as the increasing frequency of natural hazards such as cold waves, storm surges will all exert negative effects on the country's development and economy including agriculture, aquaculture, road infrastructure, etc. Some issues, such as land subsidence (caused by excessive groundwater extraction) further worsen some of the effects climate change will bring (sea level rise) especially in areas such as the Mekong Delta.Groundwater extraction, land subsidence, and sea-level rise in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam The government, NGOs, and citizens have taken various measures to mitigate and adapt to the impact.  Background  The increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere has caused anthropogenic global climate change, which has drawn wide attention from the international community. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an intergovernmental organization affiliated with the United Nations, established in 1998 by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, to study climate change caused by human activities.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC). http://www.ipcc.ch/ The IPCC report (2014) believes that global climate change will have a major impact on a large number of countries, which is unfavorable for areas with poor adaptability and unusually fragile natural conditions. Unfortunately, Vietnam is identified by IPCC as one of the countries likely to be most affected by climate change (IPCC 1994, 2001)IPCC: CLIMATE CHANGE 2014 Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability Summaries, Frequently Asked Questions, and Cross-Chapter Boxes, A Working Group II Contribution to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment- report/ar5/wg2/WGIIAR5-IntegrationBrochure_FINAL.pdf , 2014. due to its extensive coastline, vast deltas and floodplains, location on the path of typhoons as well as its large population in poverty.Nguyen Danh Thao, Hiroshi Takagi, Miguel Esteban. Coastal Disasters and Climate Change in Vietnam . Burlington : Elsevier Science, 2014.  Projected effects  Through various observations and research methods, scholars generally believe that in the past historical period and the forecasting future model, over the whole territory of Vietnam, climate change signals have been identified through the changes in various observed climate elements. In sum, the temperature and the precipitation are generally presenting an increasing trend; the frequency of extreme values is rising. Moreover, the precipitation distribution of time and space is more uneven. = Temperature = According to daily data collected from 23 coastal meteorological stations in Vietnam for the period from 1960 to 2011, during the 52 years (from 1960 to 2011), average annual temperatures in the coastal zones of Vietnam have increased significantly. High increases of 0.24‚ÑÉ and 0.28‚ÑÉ per decade are found at Vung Tau and Ca Mau stations, respectively, located in the South Coast. Most of the stations in the North- Central Coast show an increase of 0.15‚ÑÉto 0.19‚ÑÉ per decade. (Figure 1)Schmidt- Thom√©, Philipp; Nguyen, Thi Ha; Pham, Thanh Long. Climate Change Adaptation Measures in Vietnam: Development and Implementation. Springer International Publishing, 2015. Figure 1. Change in annual average temperature (¬∞C) during the last 52 years in Vietnam [source MONRE (2012a, b)] Furthermore, changes in maximum temperature in Vietnam varied in the range from ‚àí3 ¬∞C to 3 ¬∞C. Changes in minimum temperatures mostly varied in the range from ‚àí5 ¬∞C to 5 ¬∞C. Both maximum and minimum temperatures have tended to increase, with minimum temperatures increasing faster than maximum temperatures, reflecting the trend of global climate warming.ibid. = Precipitation = Unlike temperature, changes in rainfall trends vary significantly between regions. (Figure 2) Statistics of rainfall over Vietnam for the period from 1961 to 2008 show a significant increasing trend in the South-Central Coast while it has tended to decrease in the northern coast (from approximately 17N northward). Another indicator is the annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1day). During 1961 to 2008, there is an increasing trend of up to 14% per decade for RX1day, which means that the extreme value of rainfall has been mounting.ibid. Figure 2. Change in precipitation (%) during the last 52 years in Vietnam [source MONRE (2012a, b)] = Sea Level Rise, Extreme Weather and Others = One significant result is the sea level rise and seawater intrusion, with the coastline retreat, coastal erosion, salinity intrusion related to them. Also, scholars warn that other hydrological problems will emerge, such as flood, river mouth evolution, sedimentation. Frequency of tropical cyclones, storm surges, tsunami and other natural hazards will increase, too, to varying degrees.Nguyen Danh Thao, Hiroshi Takagi, Miguel Esteban. Coastal Disasters and Climate Change in Vietnam . Burlington : Elsevier Science, 2014. The water level monitored at Vietnam coastal gauges has shown that the pattern of changes in annual average sea level is different over the years (starting 1960). Almost all the stations have shown an increasing trend. (See Figure 3) Based on data collected from the monitoring stations the mean sea level rise along the Vietnamese coastal area is about 2.8 mm/ year during the period 1993‚Äì2008 (MONRE - Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam, 2009).Schmidt-Thom√©, Philipp; Nguyen, Thi Ha; Pham, Thanh Long. Climate Change Adaptation Measures in Vietnam: Development and Implementation. Springer International Publishing, 2015. According to these simulations, 37% of the total area of the Mekong Delta may be inundated to a depth of over 1 m under a sea level rise scenario of 0.5 m.Nguyen Danh Thao, Hiroshi Takagi, Miguel Esteban. Coastal Disasters and Climate Change in Vietnam . Burlington : Elsevier Science, 2014. Figure 3. Change in sea level based on data from measuring stations (1960‚Äì2010) [source MONRE (2009, 2012a, b)] The Southern Institute of Water Resources Research (SIWRR) reported the increasing trend of salinity intrusion. A large area of the Mekong Delta is seasonally affected by salinity intrusion during the dry season, especially during the months of March and April, when river flow is at its minimum. Considerable changes have been observed in the flow regime of the Mekong River, with a lower water flow at the beginning of the dry season, resulting in salinity intrusion starting earlier than usual.ibid. Other consequences are the increased frequency of extreme weather events. In the past 40 years, the number of typhoons in Vietnam has decreased, but the intensity has increased and the scope of damage has expanded. According to this scenario, the intensity and unpredictability of the typhoon will increase, and the scope of damage will continue to expand southward. In 2007 to 2008, the flooding in the central provinces exceeded that of past 48 years; the northern part of Vietnam encountered an unprecedented cold wave, lasting for 38 days, resulting in 30 million US dollars Crop and livestock losses.Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. Picture 1. In June, 2012, Huy·ªán Th·ªç Xuan, Thanh Hoa Province, people waded on flooded roads. This outbreak of floods in central and northern Vietnam killed 16 people and injured 38.https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/ch/2639-The- threat-to-Vietnam-s-poor  The impact on various Aspects  Vietnam's geography of long coastal areas and monsoon rains makes its land and people highly sensitive to the above-mentioned results such as elevations in sea levels and the intensification of weather extremes that climate change will bring.http://asean.zwbk.org/newsdetail/19365.html While the magnitude and speed of such trends remains unclear, there is sufficient certainty in the range of likely effects. The most obvious and extensive impact is on economic growth, which could be observed in a number of sectors. Other impacts, for instance, on health are also increasing. = Agriculture = Agriculture still accounts for about a quarter of Vietnam's GDP and is the main livelihood of 60% of the population.Nguyen Danh Thao, Hiroshi Takagi, Miguel Esteban. Coastal Disasters and Climate Change in Vietnam . Burlington : Elsevier Science, 2014. However, agriculture is one of the industries that are directly and adversely affected by climate change. The impact of climate change on agriculture is reflected in the problems of agricultural land, plants, livestock, their survival and development, water supply difficulties and natural disasters affecting agricultural production. Changes in yields vary widely across crops, agroecological zones, and climate scenarios. For rice, the projected Dry scenario would lead to reductions in yields ranging from 12 percent in the Mekong River Delta to 24 percent in the Red River Delta.Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. Daily meteorological data at 19 representative locations over the recent 50 years (1959 to 2009) were collected to analyze Northern Vietnam' s climatic change and its effects on rice production. On one side, the rising temperature due to the increase in CO2 concentration will increase the rice planting area in Vietnam and prolong the growing season. It is very likely that the rice planting limit in northern Vietnam will move west and north, the area will expand and the multiple cropping index will increase. On the other side, the growth period of rice in winter and spring is sensitive to temperature. The development process is accelerated, the vegetative growth period is shortened, even early flowering occurs, which is not conducive to the yield.YANG Wen-kan and L I Xiang-ge, \\"Climatic Change and Its Effect on Rice Yields in the North Vietnam\\", Journal of Nanjing Institute of Meteorology, Vol. 27, No.1, Feb.2015. There would be more extensive inundation of crop land in the rainy season and increased saline intrusion in the dry season as a consequence of the combination of sea level rise and higher river flooding. For the Mekong River Delta, it is estimated that about 590,000 ha of rice area could be lost due to inundation and saline intrusion, which accounts for about 13 percent of today's rice production in the region.ibid. Table 1 shows the potential impact of climate change without adaptation under alternative climate scenarios on production of six major crops or crop categories relative to a 2050 baseline.Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE). http://www.dmhcc.gov.vn/ Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. Table 1. Change in Crop Production in 2050 due to Climate Change with No Adaptation (million metric tons ) = Aquaculture = Aquaculture, especially in the Mekong River Delta, is an important source of employment and rural income. It is estimated that some 2.8 million people are employed in the sector, while export revenue is expected to be about $2.8 billion in 2010. Higher temperatures, an increased frequency of storms, sea level rise, and other effects of climate change are likely to affect fish physiology and ecology as well as the operation of aquaculture. Some fish species, such as catfish, may grow more rapidly with higher temperatures but be more vulnerable to disease. Meanwhile, the main impacts of climate change on aquaculture seem likely to be a consequence of increased flooding and salinity.ibid. = Other Impacts on Economy = The International Monetary Fund estimates that Vietnam's economic growth may fall by 10% in 2021 due to climate change. Vietnam's coastline is 3,200 kilometers long and 70 percent of its population lives in coastal areas and low‚Äêlying deltas (GFDRR 2015).The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) .2015. Given the country's concentration of population and economic assets in exposed areas, the negative impact on industrial production and economic growth could be unimaginable. A 1-meter rise in sea level would partially inundate 11 percent of the population and 7 percent of agricultural land (World Bank and GFDRR 2011; GFDRR 2015).Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. Also, extreme natural disasters has caused huge Vietnamese casualties and property damage. In the first half of 2016, water intrusion, heavy rainfall, and extremely cold weather resulted in 37 deaths and 108 injuries, disaster losses are estimated to be 757 million US dollars.Alan Boyd. \\"Climate change refugees imperil Vietnam‚Äôs growth\\" JANUARY 11, 2018. Asia Times. http://www.atimes.com/article/climate-change- refugees-imperil-vietnams-growth/ Moreover, current and future domestic infrastructure is influenced. For instance, the physical asset of road infrastructure, will be vulnerable to climate change impacts. Based on the existing road inventories and provincial allocations, one meter SLR would inundate, and hence destroy, 19,000 kilometers of roads in Vietnam, which is equivalent to 12 percent of existing road stocks. As reported in Table 2, rebuilding these damaged roads would cost approximately US$2.1 billion.Paul S. Chinowsky, Amy E. Schweikert, Niko Strzepek and Kenneth Strzepek. \\"Road Infrastructure and Climate Change in Vietnam\\", Sustainability, July, 2015. ISSN 2071-1050. Table 2. Projected national road damages from one meter sea level rise. = Impacts on Health = Climate warming will directly or indirectly affect the spread of many infectious diseases, especially for the occurrence and spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, viral encephalitis and dengue. As the temperature of the sea surface rises, the incidence of disease transmitted through the water body will also increase. Tran Thi Giang Huong, Director of the Department of International Cooperation of the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, stated in 2017 that \\"from 2030 to 2050, climate change will cause, every year, 250,000 people's death from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat shock\\" globally, according to the World Health Organization.https://www.who.int/news-room/fact- sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health  Various responses  * Based on IPCC's classification, responses to deal with climate change could be generally classified into two genres: mitigation and adaptation. Climate change mitigation generally involves reductions in human (anthropogenic) emissions of greenhouse gases. Adaptation, in a broad sense, refers to all measures to respond to the existing and potential impacts, such as building seawalls to adapt to sea level rise, upgrading water reservoirs to adapt to flood and other water resource problems, etc. The Vietnamese authorities have been responding to international initiatives to better understand and mitigate climate issues as well as putting large effort into adaptive measures. The country ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1994 and ratified the ‚ÄúKyoto Protocol‚Äù in 2002. According to the reporting obligations of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Vietnam issued the preliminary national initiative in December 2003, with the baseline lists of greenhouse gas emissions, mitigation options in the energy, forestry and agriculture sectors, and assessment of final adaptation measures (MONRE, 2003).Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. MONRE (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam) drafted the National Target Plan for Climate Change (NTP-RCC), which was approved in December 2008 by the Prime Minister's Decree (Vietnam Government, 2008). In 2015, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment issued the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Climate Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (Vietnam SREX)Ôºåsuggesting a series of measures to prevent extreme weather disasters.Thu Thi Nguyen & Jamie Pittock&Bich; Huong Nguyen, \\"Integration of ecosystem-based adaptation to climate change policies in Viet Nam\\". Climate Change. Feb.2017. Apart from NTP-RCC, Vietnam government has been cooperating with other countries and international organizations. The Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of Vietnam is hosting 58 foreign programs and projects to assist Vietnam in tackling climate change, with a commitment of nearly US$430 million, including funding from World Bank, the Holland government and the Denmark government.VOV5.vn. \\"Vietnam Strengthens International Cooperation to Address Climate Change\\", http://vovworld.vn/zh- CN/%E6%97%B6%E4%BA%8B%E8%AF%84%E8%AE%BA/%E8%B6%8A%E5%8D%97%E5%8A%A0%E5%BC%BA%E5%9B%BD%E9%99%85%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C%E5%BA%94%E5%AF%B9%E6%B0%94%E5%80%99%E5%8F%98%E5%8C%96-247776.vov In recent years, international cooperation mechanisms involving climate issues emerges. The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism, is one mechanism between countries in the Mekong Basin (including China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam) to jointly enhance economic growth, poverty reduction, and, to deal with climate change and the water resources allocation associated with it.The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Mechanism. http://www.lmcchina.org/eng/. * In response to different impacts, the measures vary. In order to deal with the direct consequence of Sea Level Rise, the authority suggests measures including full protection: strengthening and elevating embankments nationwide; elevating houses above flood levels as well as withdrawal: ‚Äúaverts‚Äù sea-level rise impacts by leaving coastal areas and retreating inland. In terms of agriculture, the programmes by the government as well as local farmers could be roughly divided into three aspects: * Short-term measures: Prevent soil erosion, implement soil protection, provide proactive crop irrigation, select crops suited to climate change, etc. * Long-term measures: Adopt climate change-suited cropping patterns, create new species, modernize cultivation and stockbreeding techniques, etc. * Management and harvesting practices: Redistribute regional crop and livestock production to better suit changing climate conditions, provide additional incentives for agriculture, forestry and aquafarming, etc.Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change: 70272 Vietnam. Washington, DC. The World Bank Group. 2010. Due to specific geographical conditions, local governments choose to carry programmes according to their own consideration under the framework of NTP-RCC. For instance, local government in Thanh Hoa Province and the Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province have released a large number of proposal and projects on upgrading of water reservoirs, revision of the landuse plan, and lectures and exhibitions to raise climate change awareness for all public servants, organizations, citizens. These measures are also divided into priority projects in the period 2013-2015, 2016-2020 according to the time schedule, and projects on groundwater resources, salinisation protection, natural disaster damage control, etc. according to different sectors.Schmidt-Thom√©, Philipp; Nguyen, Thi Ha; Pham, Thanh Long. Climate Change Adaptation Measures in Vietnam: Development and Implementation. Springer International Publishing, 2015. Table 3. Some priority projects regarding climate change adaptation measures in the Ba Ria-Vung Tau Provinceibid.  Different opinions  The development and the implementation of climate change response measures is very demanding and complicated because it involves several scientific disciplines, stakeholders and decision makers. In respect to responses to climate change in Vietnam, there are different voices, such as criticism on the authorities' measures, calls for more emphasis on farmers, women, etc. This is not only due to different methods the researchers adopted, different sources, for different purposes, and also due to the divergence exist in different regions, different geographical conditions, different political and economic statuses and relationship, different genders, etc. = Criticism of the Government's Response = Though the government has issued policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions, it is widely believed that it is difficult for Vietnam to achieve the target of mitigation. Vietnam is one of the top 10 countries with the most serious air pollution in the world. The level of unsafe particles is similar to that of large cities and industrial areas in China. The International Monetary Fund reports that Vietnam's greenhouse gas emissions will triple by 2030, basically because of the dependence on fossil fuels for power generation.Alan Boyd. \\"Climate change refugees imperil Vietnam‚Äôs growth\\" JANUARY 11, 2018. Asia Times. http://www.atimes.com/article/climate-change-refugees-imperil-vietnams- growth/. Coal currently accounts for 35% of the country's primary energy supply, higher than 15% in 2000. By 2035, Vietnam's coal demand is more likely to grow nearly 2.5 times. As little substitutes are adopted, the country will rely more on imported coal and it will be difficult to achieve the 8% reduction target by 2030.ibid. There are other critics on the government's climate change adaptive strategy. Some people believe that up to now government policies have focused on sector-wide assessments for the whole country and on ‚Äúhard‚Äù adaptation measures‚Äîsuch as sea dikes, reinforced infrastructure, and durable buildings. Little attention has been paid to ‚Äúsoft‚Äù adaptation measures like increasing institutional capacity or the role of collective action and social capital in building resilience. Moreover, Fran√ßois Fortier (School of International Development and Global Studies, University of Ottawa) claims, in his essay, \\"Taking a climate chance: A procedural critique of Vietnam‚Äôs climate change strategy\\",Fran√ßois Fortier, \\"Taking a climate chance: A procedural critique of Vietnam‚Äôs climate change strategy\\", Asia Pacific Viewpoint, Vol. 51, No. 3, December 2010, pp229‚Äì247. that the government's projects are partial and problematic in several ways. The first problem, according to Fortier, lies in the design of the process. It is mainly based on narrow analyses of the official information that \\"remain mostly blind to the power relations\\", which will necessarily shape climate change policy-making. Second, government's measures indeed increase poor citizen's vulnerability to climate change. He took the instance of the privatization of mangroves as the main reasons for the increase in long-term inequality in Xuan Thuy.ibid. Then, this inequality is related to vulnerability, by directly concentrating human resources in the hands of fewer people, thereby limiting the right to use and dispose of assets under stressful strategies; and also by indirectly strengthening poverty and marginalization in local areas. Fortier concluded that the context of narrow political reforms and accumulation-intensifying capitalist delimits the possibilities and constraints of \\"the emerging stakes\\", objectives and processes of the Vietnamese government's climate change strategy. According to Fran√ßois Fortier's analysis, Vietnam government's current adapting strategy therefore reflects and reinforces existing power relations in both politics and production. He believes that the national climate change strategy provides \\"an illusion of intervention and security\\", but actually largely fails to identify and mitigate the underlying causes of climate change, or to lay the ground for a mid-term and long-term adaptation strategy that can truly cope with \\"yet unknown levels of climatic and other structural changes.\\"ibid. = The Hidden Inequality between Different Groups Dealing with Climate Change = Due to the inequality in identity and economic and social status, the impact of climate change vary on different people. Also, due to natural conditions, the effect on regions vary in degrees. Regions such as the Mekong Delta are more vulnerable to climate change. Thus, in respond to the impacts, people in different regions tend to take different measures, in which process, the vulnerable group, especially the worst off, are often not able to equally enjoy the benefit of the government's policy, or might even be severely marginalized or impaired. One observation on adaptive measures comes from Le Dang, H. and Li, E., Nuberg, I. et al. In \\"Farmers‚Äô assessments of private adaptive measures to climate change and influential factors: a study in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam\\"(2014), the authors collected data from structured interviews with 598 rice farmers in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam. They argue that adapting to climate change in agriculture fundamentally depends on farmers' perceptions on climate change, their adaptive institutions and the effectiveness of adaptive measures.Le Dang, H., Li, E., Nuberg, I. et al. \\"Farmers‚Äô assessments of private adaptive measures to climate change and influential factors: a study in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam\\", Nat Hazards, Volume 71, Issue 1, pp 385‚Äì401, 2014. Farmers in the Mekong Delta have different perceptions of climate change due to their knowledge, information resources, etc. Importantly, inappropriate adaptive decisions can result from misleading perceptions. When farmers obtained the information of adaptive measures from their friends, relatives, neighbours or other sources (e.g. the Internet, pesticide companies and priests), this influenced their adaptation assessments. In contrast, there was no significant influence of information from public media and local authorities. (According to their research, only 11 of the 598 respondents obtained the information of adaptive measures from the Internet. ) Le Dang, H. and Li, E., Nuberg indicate that the sources and quality of information are particularly important and expect the improvement of both the accessibility and usefulness of local services. They believe that the improvement of farmers' knowledge about these matters should be the prior focus of the authorities in the Mekong Delta intending to promote adaptive behaviours. Some scholars also suggest that if we look inside the family, gender inequality exists under the impact of climate change. Ashok K. Mishra and Valerian O. Pede, in their essay, \\"Perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in Vietnam: Are there intra-household gender differences?\\", argue that the socio-economic vulnerability of rural poor women is often entangled with the vulnerability of climate change; climate change often further expands their gender disadvantage.Ashok K. Mishra and Valerian O. Pede, \\"Perception of climate change and adaptation strategies in Vietnam: Are there intra-household gender differences?\\". International Journal of Climate Change Strategies and Management. Vol. 9 No. 4, 2017. pp. 501-516. The extreme weather caused by climate change, such as high temperatures, cold waves, and floods, increases the labor burden of women; infectious diseases due to warmer temperatures impair women's health. Since women are inherently at a disadvantage due to access to family and social resources, Ashok K. Mishra and Valerian O. Pede state that it is necessary to enhance women's awareness of climate change and promote the development of human resources. to organize environmental knowledge training and knowledge contests, moreover, to implement projects to improve women's disaster response capabilities. As can be seen above, some people believe that the current policies and programmes have certain defects, ignoring the disadvantaged groups. Therefore, there are some voices arguing that adaptation options that reduce poverty and increase household resilience or that integrate climate change into development planning should be emphasized.

It shows a relationship between serious accidents, minor accidents and near misses and proposes that if the number of minor accidents is reduced then there will be a corresponding fall in the number of serious accidents. The triangle was first proposed by Herbert William Heinrich in 1931 and has since been updated and expanded upon by other writers, notably Frank E. Bird. It is often shown pictorially as a triangle or pyramid and has been described as a cornerstone of 20th century workplace health and safety philosophy. In recent times it has come under criticism over the values allocated to each category of accident and for focusing only on the reduction in minor injuries.  Development  The triangle shows a relationship between the number of accidents resulting in serious injury, minor injuries or no injuries. The relationship was first proposed in 1931 by Herbert William Heinrich in his Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach. Heinrich was a pioneer in the field of workplace health and safety. He worked as an assistant superintendent for an insurance company and wanted to reduce the number of serious industrial accidents. He commenced a study of more than 75,000 accident reports from the insurance company's files as well as records held by individual industry sites. From this data he proposed a relationship of one major injury accident to 29 minor injury accidents, to 300 no-injury accidents. He drew the conclusion that, by reducing the number of minor accidents, industrial companies would see a correlating fall in the number of major accidents. The relationship is often shown pictorially in the form of a triangle or pyramid. The triangle was widely used in industrial health and safety programmes over the following 80 years and was described as a cornerstone of health and safety philosophy. Heinrich's theory also suggested that 88% of all accidents were caused by a human decision to carry out an unsafe act. The theory was developed further by Frank E Bird in 1966 based on the analysis of 1.7 million accident reports from almost 300 companies. He produced an amended triangle that showed a relationship of one serious injury accident to 10 minor injury (first aid only) accidents, to 30 damage causing accidents, to 600 near misses. Bird showed a relationship between the number of reported near misses and the number of major accidents and claimed that the majority of accidents could be predicted and prevented by an appropriate intervention. The numbers used by Bird were confirmed by a 1974 study by A. D. Swain, entitled The Human Element in Systems Safety. The theory was later expanded upon by Bird and Germain in 1985's Practical Loss Control Leadership.  Criticism  Heinrich's triangle had a significant impact on health and safety culture in the 20th century but has recently been criticised. Some of this criticism regards to the exact figures used in the relationship. A 2010 report relating to the oil and gas industry showed that the original values held true only when applied to a large dataset and a broad range of activities. A 1991 study showed that in confined spaces the relationship was significantly different: 1.2 minor injuries for each serious injury or death. A broad study of UK accident data in the mid 1990s showed a relationship of 1 fatality to 207 major injuries, to 1,402 injuries causing three or more days lost time injuries, to 2,754 minor injuries. Heinrich's original files have since been lost so his accident figures cannot be proven. W. Edwards Deming stated that Heinrich's theory attributing human action as the cause of most accidents in the workplace was incorrect and it was, in fact, poor management systems that caused the majority of accidents. There has also been criticism of the triangle for focusing attention on the reduction of minor accidents. It has been claimed that this has led to workplace supervisors to ignore more serious but less likely risks when planning works in order to focus on reducing the likelihood of more common but less serious risks. The 2010 oil and gas study claimed that this attitude had led to a halt in the reduction of fatalities in that industry in the preceding five to eight years, despite a significant reduction in minor accidents.

Listed at , he plays the center position. Garuba was born in Madrid, Spain to Nigerian parents and joined the youth sections of Spanish club Real Madrid at age 11. In 2019, when he was 17 years old, he became the youngest starter in Real Madrid history. Garuba was named most valuable player (MVP) of the 2016 FIBA U16 European Championship at age 14 and has led Spain to three medals in junior FIBA tournaments.  Early life and youth career  Born in Hospital 12 de Octubre in Madrid, Garuba was raised in the neighborhood of Villaverde Alto and the municipality of Azuqueca de Henares (province of Guadalajara). He grew up playing football, his original passion, but switched to basketball because his exceptional height limited his success in the former sport. Garuba idolized former National Basketball Association (NBA) player Kareem Abdul- Jabbar. In November 2011, he joined Escuela Municipal de Baloncesto de Azuqueca (Municipal Basketball School of Azuqueca), where coach and coordinator David Serrano helped him start his basketball career. In 2013, Garuba joined the lower categories of Real Madrid. He stood and weighed 81 kg (179 lbs) by the time he was 12 years old. In 2015, Garuba helped his team win the Minicopa Endesa, an under-14 Spanish club tournament. He debuted by posting 24 points and 16 rebounds in a win over Valencia. In the following year, Garuba led Real Madrid to another Minicopa title and was named MVP of the competition. He averaged 22.8 rebounds per game in the tournament, grabbing 32 against Joventut Badalona in the final. In February 2018, Garuba gained his first Adidas Next Generation Tournament (ANGT) experience with the Real Madrid under-18 team at the Munich qualifying tournament, after missing the previous edition with a quadriceps injury. He was selected to the All- Tournament Team, despite being one of the youngest participants. In the final tournament, Garuba averaged 12 points and 6.5 rebounds per game and was named ANGT Rising Star. In January 2019, he was named MVP of the ANGT Munich tournament after averaging 16.5 points, seven rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game. Garuba helped Real Madrid win the final tournament and joined MVP Mario Nakiƒá on the All-Tournament Team.  Professional career  In the 2017‚Äì18 season, Garuba played for Real Madrid B, the reserve team for Real Madrid in the Liga EBA, the fourth-tier league in Spain. In 11 games, he averaged 11.1 points, 9.2 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game. In the 2018‚Äì19 season, he continued to primarily play for Real Madrid B, averaging 14.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.5 blocks per game over 22 Liga EBA appearances. On 28 October 2018, at 16 years and seven months of age, Garuba debuted for Real Madrid in the Liga ACB, the first-tier league in Spain, against Miraflores. He became the youngest center in ACB history, surpassing Jos√© √Ångel Antelo, and the third-youngest Real Madrid debutant, behind Luka Donƒçiƒá and Roberto N√∫√±ez. In the 2019‚Äì20 season, Garuba became a full-time member of Real Madrid's senior team. In his season debut against Joventut Badalona, at 17 years, six months, and 19 days of age, he eclipsed Donƒçiƒá as Real Madrid's youngest-ever starter. On 29 September, Garuba recorded 13 points and 10 rebounds in a win over Murcia to become the youngest player with a double- double or 10 rebounds in ACB history; Donƒçiƒá had previously held both records. He was also the second-youngest player to post an efficiency rating of 24 in the ACB, behind only Ricky Rubio. On 30 October 2019, Garuba made his EuroLeague debut, recording 12 points, four rebounds, three steals, and a Performance Index Rating of 20, against Bayern Munich. He finished the season averaging 4.4 points, 4.4 rebounds and 0.7 blocks in 15 minutes per game and was an ACB All-Young Players Team selection.  National team career  Garuba made his junior national team debut for Spain at the 2016 FIBA U16 European Championship in Radom, Poland. He was named MVP after leading his team to a gold medal and averaging 16.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, and a tournament-leading 2.9 blocks per game. A 14-year-old and the second youngest player in the tournament, Garuba became the first player from a lower age group to ever win MVP at the event. After recording 15 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 blocks in the final against Lithuania, he joined Dario ≈†ariƒá and Ricky Rubio as the only players in history with a triple-double in the final of the tournament. In the summer of 2017, Garuba was unable to return to national team duty because he was recovering from a knee injury suffered earlier that year. At the 2018 FIBA U16 European Championship in Novi Sad, Serbia, he averaged 16.3 points and 12.3 rebounds per game and led Spain to a silver medal, earning a spot on the All-Star Five. Garuba helped Spain win a gold medal at the 2019 FIBA U18 European Championship in Volos, Greece, joining his teammate and MVP Santi Aldama on the All-Star Five after averaging 15.6 points, 12.9 rebounds, and 2.1 blocks per game.  Personal life  Garuba's parents are from Benin City, Nigeria but left to escape conflict in their hometown. After initially moving to Brussels, they settled in Madrid in the 1990s without work permits. His father, Mustapha, works for manufacturing company Bimbo in Guadalajara, and his mother, Betty, works for the Azuqueca employment program. Garuba has one younger brother, Sediq (b. 2004) and a younger sister, Uki (b. 2010).

Beneath and behind the Guildhall is the Pannier Market; completed in 1855, the building has been a Grade II* listed building since 19 January 1951. The Guildhall The Guildhall is located on Barnstaple's High Street, on the corner with Butchers' Row. Originally, a meat market was on the present site with a corn market above made up of 34 stalls running from the High Street to Anchor Lane, about halfway down the length of the present Pannier Market. The people of Barnstaple were unwilling to extend the market further at this time as they were concerned at the high cost required to buy the site and feared that a Pannier Market in the town would not be a success. Meanwhile, vegetables and dairy goods continued to be sold from panniers outside on either side of the High Street. Eventually it was decided to build a Guildhall on the High Street end of the meat market. Designed by Thomas Lee in the neo- classical style in 1826 and completed in 1828, the smoothly rusticated ground floor supports an upper floor with Ionic pilasters and pediment, modest in scale and appearance. The High Street fa√ßade has five arches with the central bay wider than the others. The side wall facing Butchers' Row is probably by local architect R.D. Gould and dates to 1855. While the Guildhall is built of solid and rendered walls, portions exposed internally during works in 1991 suggest that the front wall is built of red brick while the right side wall (which is possibly a pre-1826 party wall) is built of stone rubble. The roof is slated while the rendered chimney has a moulded cornice on its right gable- end. In the blind window facing Butchers' Row is an octagonal clock face originally on the Northgate from about 1760 to its demolition in 1842 when it was removed to the Bluecoat School where it remained from 1842 to 1971 until it was moved to its present position in 1982. To the left of the doorway below is the Mayor's poor box constructed of iron and dated to 1895. The Main Chamber View of the Chamber looking South The Chamber looking North The Chamber still retains may of its features from the time it served as a courtroom having a bench for the Justices' at its South side together with similar side-benches and two square mobile boxes on rollers for the accused and witnesses. Above the side benches are short galleries for ladies and the grand jury while at the North side is located tiered seating for the general public. In front of the bench is a large table for the clerk and lawyers. The Chamber was the meeting place of the historic Borough of Barnstaple.Oliver, W. Bruce, Barnstaple Borough, Transactions of the Devon Association, vol. 62, (1930) pp.269‚Äì273 Not used as a courtroom since the 1960s, the Chamber ceased to be the local seat of government as well when North Devon Council was formed in 1974. However, the Chamber continues to serve as the meeting room for Barnstaple Town Council and here take place the annual Mayor Making Ceremony and the Fair Proclamation. On the walls of the Chamber are displayed portraits of former Mayors of Barnstaple and various other local dignitaries including local benefactor William Frederick Rock and Barnstaple-born John Gay, author of The Beggar's Opera.The Council Chamber, Barnstaple Guildhall - Art UK database Some of these were painted by the noted artist Thomas Hudson and a number were restored with funding from the National Lottery. The Dodderidge Room The ornately carved fireplace in the panelled Dodderidge Room The Dodderidge Room displays the town's collection of silver and other relics connected with the history of Barnstaple.Clarke, p. 12 The beautiful carved fireplace is from the former Dodderidge House in Cross Street in Barnstaple that belonged to wealthy local merchant, ship-owner and three times Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1621, 1624 and 1625, Pentecost Dodderidge, after whom the room is named. The house was demolished in 1910 following which the fireplace was moved to a Marist Convent in the town. In 1949 the fireplace and panelling in the room were given to the Guildhall by Alderman John Smale. The top feature on the fireplace was carved locally and dates from 1617 and displays the initials PD and ED; PD for Pentecost Dodderidge himself and ED for his wife, Elizabeth, whom he married in 1599. The main body of the fireplace may have been carved in London or Spain. The Mayoral chain displayed in a cabinet in the room dates from 1872; this became the chain of the Lady Mayoress in 1911 when a new Mayor's chain was designed and created by Fred Partridge. This new Mayor's chain was funded by donations from the descendants of former Mayors of Barnstaple and the medallions incorporate scenes from the town including the old Guildhall, the Castle Mound and Queen Anne's Walk together with representations of the old town seals and portraits of William Frederick Rock and Pentecost Dodderidge.Clarke, p. 32 The display of silver includes a silver-gilt steeple cup and cover of 1589 given, according to its Latin inscription, by Richard Dodderidge, the father of Penetcost Dodderidge after whom the room is named; silver-gilt steeple cups and covers of similar design dated 1606 and 1620, the latter donated by John Penrose, after whom Penrose's Almshouses in the town are named; two silver-gilt ceremonial maces made by local goldsmith John Peard and dated 1660, replacing earlier ones made in 1425; two silver tankards from 1676 donated by Thomas Horwood, Mayor of Barnstaple in 1653; a punch bowl of 1745 donated by Thomas Benson, Member of Parliament for Barnstaple in 1749; and an 18 inch long oar c1780 signifying an Admiralty warrant for the Mayor in his capacity as Water Bailiff for the Port of Barnstaple. It is inscribed \\"John Morse Esq., Mayor\\" on one side, and \\"Barnstaple Water Bailiff\\" on the other. The smaller oar signifies the Admiralty warrant of Harbourmaster and would have been worn by Barnstaple's Harbourmaster like a piece of jewellery. Also displayed in this room is a small collection of ship models made by French prisoners-of-war from the Napoleonic Wars.Nikolaus Pevsner, The Buildings of England: North Devon, Penguin Books (1952) p. 47Clarke, p. 31Clarke, pp. 28-30 The Mayor's Parlour The Mayor's Parlour was created in 1922 out of the former charge- room and cell and today is a working office and meeting space. Displayed here are a number of historic artifacts including an American flag donated by Barnstaple's twin town of Barnstable in Massachusetts.Clarke, p. 33 Displayed on the walls are rolls of honour listing past Mayors of Barnstaple together with a number of pictures and other artifacts connected with Barnstaple's twin towns and the town's links with the Royal Family. Pannier Market Interior of the Pannier Market in 1907 The interior of the Pannier Market at Barnstaple in Devon in 2018 The exterior of the Pannier Market Barnstaple has been the major market for North Devon since Saxon times. Demands for health regulation of its food market in Victorian times saw the construction in 1855 to 1856 of the town's Pannier Market, originally known as the Vegetable Market and designed by local architect Richard Davey Gould. Like its sister market at nearby Bideford, the building has a high glass and timber roof on iron columns. At long, it runs the length of Butchers' Row from the High Street to Boutport Street. This new building intended for the selling of vegetables was built on the site of the old meat market, with a Corn Market and Music Hall built shortly after at the Boutport Street end. The butchers who were forced out of their meat market on the site were given new and permanent stalls just across the road in Butchers' Row. The Pannier Market became a great success and in 1897 local historian W.F. Gardiner wrote: \\"The result is that Barnstaple can to-day boast of the possession of Markets such as many a county town might well envy. Indeed, Barum's Pannier Market is one of the finest in the Kingdom\\".William Francis Gardiner, Barnstaple 1837-1897, Barnstaple, Ralph Allan (1897) Before the days of supermarkets the Pannier Market was the best place to obtain daily goods, many supplied by local farmers. Today the Pannier Market sells a wide range of goods on an almost daily basis, with occasional special days such as wedding fairs. Built on the other side of the street at the same time as the Pannier Market, Butchers' Row consists of ten shops with pilasters of Bath Stone, and wrought iron supports to an overhanging roof. Only one of the shops remains as a butcher. Until his death in 2018 local naturalist Johnny Kingdom regularly had a stall at the market from which he sold signed copies of his books, DVDs and photographs of wildlife. As of early 2020, the local Council's web site provided this summary for Pannier Market: \\"Largely unchanged in over 150 years, Barnstaple's historic Pannier Market has a wide range of stalls, with everything from fresh local produce, flowers and crafts, to prints and pictures, fashion and ... two caf√©s\\". The \\"Pannier Market, Butchers Row\\" has been Grade II listed since 1951.

The electoral district covered the Baku Governorate, the Elizavetpol Governorate, the Erivan Governorate, the Kutais Governorate, the Tiflis Governorate, the Batum Oblast, the Kars Oblast, the Sukhum Okrug and the Zakatal Okrug. Creation of the Transcaucasian constituency Across Russia, electoral districts for the Constituent Assembly election generally followed governorate or oblast boundaries. But in the southern Caucasus a single constituency was created for six governorates, two oblasts and two okrugs. In the debates in the All-Russian Electoral Commission the Armenian scholar Dr. Nicholas Adontz had argued in favour of creating three separate districts - Armenian, Georgian and Muslim. Muslim representatives had argued against this proposal, and in the end the Russian electoral authorities opted for a single Transcaucasian constituency. By mid-1917 the Central Transcaucasian Commission for the Elections to the Constituent Assembly was set-up, under the aegis of the Special Transcaucasian Committee (OZAKOM). Voting The vote was held in Transcaucasus November 26‚Äì28, within two weeks of the formation of the Transcaucasian Commissariat (Zavakom). 15 lists were in the fray in Transcaucasus. The three largest parties in Transcaucasus were the Mensheviks, the Musavat Party and the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaksiun). Whilst the Mensheviks were the most voted party, in Transcaucasus Menshevism had become intertwined with Georgian nationalism. Soon after the election, the Georgian Mensheviks would become openly nationalistic. The Bolshevik vote came mainly from soldiers at the Baku garrison and blue-collar workers of the same city. =Constituency- wide results= {  } =Baku Governorate= Ballot of List 10 - Muslim National Committees and the Turkic Democratic Federalist Party \\"Musavat\\".

Baku city The vote in Baku city and its surrounding industrial areas differed greatly from the rest of the governorate, with a strong Bolshevik and Armenian vote. At the oil fields and the garrison the voter participation stood at around 75%, whilst in the city proper around 52%. There were clashes reported between Musavat and Ittihad and between the Muslim Socialist Bloc and Hummet, although no major disruptions on the polling day. The Bolsheviks obtained 22,276 votes (20.1%), followed by Musavat with 21,752 votes (19.6%), Dashnaks with 20,314 votes (18.3%), SRs with 18,789 votes (16.9%), Kadets with 9,062 votes (8.2%), Ittihad with 7,850 votes (7.1%), Mensheviks 5,667 votes (5.1%), Zionists 2,081 votes (1.9%), Armenian Populists 1,508 votes (1.4%), Muslim Socialist Bloc 903 votes (0.8%), Georgian Socialist-Federalists 456 votes (0.4%), Georgian National Democrats 145 votes (0.1%), Popular Socialists 116 votes (0.1%) and Western Transcaucasian Muslims 3 votes. In the city proper (i.e. excluding the oil fields and the garrison) the Dashnaks obtained the highest vote, 12,517 votes, followed by the Musavat and Bolshevik lists. The Kadet vote in the governorate was centered in Baku city. In the Baku garrison the Bolsheviks got 7,699 voted (70.8%).

She showed considerable ability as a juvenile in 2017, winning the Debutante Stakes and finishing second in the Moyglare Stud Stakes as well as running fourth in both the Prix Marcel Boussac and the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she won the Kilboy Estate Stakes but did not produce her best form until autumn when she took the British Champions Fillies and Mares Stakes and was narrowly beaten in the Breeders' Cup Turf. In 2019 she won the Alleged Stakes, Mooresbridge Stakes, Tattersalls Gold Cup, Irish Champion Stakes and Champion Stakes as well as finishing second in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, Eclipse Stakes and Yorkshire Oaks. Background Magical is a bay filly with a large white star and a white sock on her right hind leg bred in Ireland by Orpendale, Chelston & Wynatt, breeding companies associated with the Coolmore Stud organisation. The filly was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of her ownership have changed from race to race: she has sometimes been listed as being the property of Derrick Smith, while on other occasions she has been described as being owned by a partnership of Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. She was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland five times. His other progeny include Frankel, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Magical's dam Halfway to Heaven was one of the best European fillies of her generation, winning the Irish 1,000 Guineas, Nassau Stakes and Sun Chariot Stakes in 2008. As a broodmare she has produced other winners including Rhododendron. Halfway to Heaven's dam, Cassandra Go was a top class sprinter, whose wins included the King George Stakes, Temple Stakes and King's Stand Stakes and was a descendant of the Kentucky Oaks winner Native Street. Racing career=2017: two-year-old season= Magical began her racing career by finishing second to the Jim Bolger-trained Dawn Delivers in a maiden race over six furlongs at the Curragh on 16 July. On 8 August at Cork Racecourse she started 2/5 favourite for a one-mile maiden in which she was ridden by her trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien. She recorded her first success as she took the lead inside the final furlong and won by a head from the 25/1 outsider Mary Tudor. Twelve days later the filly was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Debutante Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh and started the 11/1 third choice in the betting behind her stablemates September (winner of the Chesham Stakes) and Happily in an eight-runner field which also included Dawn Delivers and Mary Tudor. Ridden by Donnacha O'Brien she led from the start and kept on well to win \\"comfortably\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Happily. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"She had a lovely run the first day and she was a bit green at Cork and made hard work of it. Donnacha was delighted with her... [he] gave her a lovely ride and had her in a good position throughout the race. She stays well and should get well beyond a mile next year\\". On 10 September at the Curragh Magical was moved up Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes in which she was partnered by Ryan Moore and started second favourite behind Alpha Centauri. She led for most of the way but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by Happily, with the pair finishing almost four lengths clear of September in third. Three weeks later she was sent to France for the Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres in which she produced a strong late run but finished fourth behind Wild Illusion, Polydream and Mission Impassible. Twelve days after her run in France, the filly started 15/8 favourite for the Fillies' Mile at Newmarket Racecourse but tired in the final furlong and came home fourth behind Laurens. =2018: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut Magical was equipped with blinkers when she contested the Group 3 Prix de la Grotte on heavy ground at Longchamp on 15 April and came home fourth of the eight runners behind Musis Amica after racing in second for most of the way. Plans to tun her in the Epsom Oaks on 1 June were abandoned two days before the race when she failed to recover from a minor leg injury. The filly had been the course for over three months when she returned for the Group 2 Kilboy Estate Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh on 22 July in which he started the 5/4 favourite. Ridden by Moore, she led from the start and drew away in the last quarter mile to win \\"comfortably\\" by two and three quarter lengths from I'm So Fancy. Aidan O'Brien commented \\"This was a nice start back for her and hopefully she's OK. She's a lovely filly, how far she'll stay, I'm not sure. We'll see how she is... The whole rest of the season is in front of her.\\" After another lengthy break, Magical reappeared for the Group 1 Matron Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse on 15 September. She raced in second place for most of the way but lost her position when she was hampered in the straight and came home fourth behind Laurens, Alpha Centauri and Clemmie. The filly was then stepped up in distance and matched against the strongest weight-for-age competition when she contested the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp on 7 October. Starting a 40/1 outsider she made steady progress in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished tenth, five and a quarter lengths behind the winner Enable. Thirteen days after her run in the Arc, the filly was back on the track for the Group 1 British Champions Fillies & Mares Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot Racecourse. With Moore in the saddle she started the 5/1 second favourite behind Lah Ti Dar (runner-up in the St Leger) in an eleven-runner field which also included Hydrangea, Kitesurf (Prix Vermeille) and Coronet (Ribblesdale Stakes). After racing in fifth place, Magical moved up to take the lead approaching the final furlong and kept on well to win by a length from Coronet with Lah Ti Dar three quarters of a length back in third. O'Brien said \\"She was working lovely ‚Äì and we're really, really delighted. We were always going to take our time with her, and she had a lovely position and relaxed. So I couldn't have been happier... She is very valuable.\\" On her final run of the season, Magical was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on 3 November in which she was ridden by Moore. She raced in mid-division before moving up to dispute the lead on the final turn. The closing stages saw a sustained struggle between Magical and the favourite Enable with the two fillies drawing right away from the field before Enable prevailed by three quarters of a length. There was a gap of nine lengths back to Sadler's Joy in third place. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Magical was given a rating of 122, making her the 20th best racehorse in the world and the third best three-year-old filly behind Almond Eye and Alpha Centauri. =2019: four-year-old season=Spring Magical began her third campaign in the Group 3 Alleged Stakes over 10 furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 13 April and started favourite ahead of seven opponents including the Irish Derby winner Latrobe and the Irish St. Leger winner Flag of Honour (also trained by O'Brien). The filly was settled in fourth place by Moore before going to the front a furlong out and drawing away to win by four and a half lengths from Flag of Honour. On 6 May Magical faced Flag of Honour and Latrobe again in the Group 2 Mooresbridge Stakes at the Curragh. Starting the 2.9/1 she took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"comfortably\\" from Flag of Honour, beating her stablemate by a length and a half. Twenty days later the filly returned to Group 1 company and started 2/7 favourite for the Tattersalls Gold Cup against four opponents, namely Flag of Honour, Verbal Dexterity (National Stakes), Mustajeer (Finale Stakes) and Zihba (Amethyst Stakes). After racing in second place she went to the front in the last quarter mile and won \\"easily\\" by seven lengths, with Flag of Honour taking second place yet again. After the race O'Brien commented: \\"We are delighted to have her as a four-year-old. She's a big, powerful mare that is full of quality, with great strength and a super mind. She had done enough last year to go off to stud, so it's a great credit to all the lads to keep her in training\\". Summer On 19 June Magical started favourite ahead of Crystal Ocean for the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot in an eight-runner field. The race was run in challenging conditions in heavy rain on soft ground. After racing in third place for most of the way the filly stayed on strongly in the straight but was unable to peg back Crystal Ocean and was beaten one and a quarter lengths into second place. The Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park on 6 July saw Magical face a rematch with her Breeders' Cup conqueror Enable. She raced in third place before keeping on well but was unable to overhaul the British mare and finished second by three quarters of a length. The filly faced Enable yet again in the Yorkshire Oaks in August and was again bested by the British mare, beaten two and three quarter lengths into second place. Autumn In the Irish Champion Stakes at Leopardstown on 14 September Magical started the 11/10 favourite against seven opponents including Anthony Van Dyck, Deirdre and Madhmoon (runner-up in the Epsom Derby). After tracking the pacemaker Hunting Horn, Magical took the lead two furlongs out, opened up a clear advantage and won by two and a quarter lengths from her stablemate Magic Wand. O'Brien commented \\"We're delighted. She had a midsummer break and had her first run back in York. We knew there when she ran Enable to a couple of lengths, knowing that she was going to come forward for it, that she was going to be in good shape for today.\\" At Longchamp on 6 October Magical went of at odds of 19/1 in her second attempt to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in which she was ridden by Donnacha O'Brien. She took the lead 500 metres from the finish but tired in the closing stages and came home fifth behind Waldgeist, Enable, Sottsass and Japan. In the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket thirteen days later Magical was partnered by Donnacha O'Brien and went off favourite in a nine-runner field which also included Coronet, Addeybb and Deirdre. She raced in second place behind Regal Reality before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and held off the sustained challenge of Addeybb to win by three quarters of a length. After the race Aidan O'Brien called her the \\"ultimate racehorse\\" adding \\"She's totally sound, mentally and physically... She handles ease in the ground, she goes on fast ground... She accepts everything on the chin and says what do you want me to do today? It's internally with her, it's her mind. She never says no\\". Magical was expected to end her racing career with a run in the Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf but the plan was abandoned when she was found to be running a high temperature shortly before her scheduled flight to the United States. In the 2019 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Magical was given a rating of 122, making her the 19th best racehorse in the world and the second best four-year-old filly behind Almond Eye.

Based on the BMW 6 Series (E63), the car was available in coup√© and convertible bodystyles. The B6 was introduced in 2005.  Development and introduction  Alpina B6 (E64) The B6 is based on the 650i and uses a modified version of its 4.4-litre N62 V8 engine, designated by Alpina as the H1 (shared with the B5 and B7). Changes to the engine include an Alpina specific block made by Steyr, a forged crankshaft and low compression Mahle pistons. The engine retains BMW's VANOS system and uses a centrifugal-type supercharger, made by ASA to Alpina's specifications and a stainless steel Akrapovic exhaust system with quad exhaust tips. These modifications allow the engine to generate at 5,500 rpm and of torque at 4,250 rpm. The choice of the forced induction V8 engine over the naturally aspirated V10 engine of the M6 grants the B6 better fuel economy figures. The engine is mated to a 6-speed ZF automatic transmission which is claimed to be more efficient than the SMG transmission found on the M6. The transmission has a full automatic mode and a manual shifting mode, called Switch Tronic. The control system was first introduced by the company in 1993, and allows the driver to change gears via two buttons located on the back of the steering wheel. The car came standard with a limited slip differential on the coup√© while it was available as an option on the convertible. The B6 has Alpina's own suspension system designed to give a soft ride in normal driving conditions, thus maintaining the grand touring nature of the car. The B6 came with the Alpina Dynamic 20-inch alloy wheels (sets of 4-spokes in a 5-spoke arrangement). The brakes used on the car were taken from the Middle-Eastern specification 760Li. The tyres are Michelin pilot sport units, measuring 255/35 ZR20 at the front and 285/30 ZR20 at the rear. Exterior changes over a regular 6 Series included a front chin spoiler with Alpina lettering, optional Alpina pinstripes on the exterior paint and a new rear diffuser. The interior came standard with Lavalina leather upholstery, wood trim, BMW iDrive system, Alpina gauges and Alpina badging throughout. The interior was fully customisable by the Alpina interior department. The B6's body in white was prepared at BMW's Dingolfing plant and was then sent to the Alpina factory in Buchloe for final assembly. Performance The B6 can accelerate from in 4.5 seconds in 9.9 seconds and can attain a top speed of . The car takes 22.8 seconds to accelerate to its top speed from a standstill.  Variants = B6 S = Alpina B6 S The B6 S is a high performance variant of the B6. Introduced in 2008, the car received further improvements over the B6, this allowed the engine to generate a maximum power output of and of torque. The increase in power was achieved by tweaking the variable valve timing on the intake and exhaust along with installing a new compressor in the supercharger which gave optimum airflow to the engine in all driving conditions. These changes didn't hamper the fuel economy and it remained the same as a standard B6. In order to improve airflow to the engine, Alpina installed a new hood made of composite materials which had openings in it to allow the air to pass to the engine. The interior options, tyres and wheels as well as the transmission remained the same as a standard B6. Performance was slightly improved over the B6, with a acceleration time of 4.5 seconds and a top speed of . = B6 GT3 = Alpina B6 GT3 rear view Introduced in 2009, the B6 GT3 marked Alpina's return to motorsport after a hiatus of 20 years.

The engine is mated to an Xtrac 6-speed sequential manual transmission operated by shift paddles on the steering column. By using carbon-fibre body panels and stripping off the interior of its luxuries, the weight was brought down to (dry). Other changes include a wide body kit with a front splitter and tow hook, a new hood with cooling vents for improved engine cooling, 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in Michelin racing slicks, a racing fuel cell, a roll cage, a big rear wing along with a diffuser, a race specific exhaust system and a Recaro racing bucket seat for the driver only. Performance figures included a acceleration time of 3.9 seconds and a top speed of . The top speed was reduced in comparison to the road going B6 due to added aerodynamic drag. The car was available for sale to privateer racing teams as well as collectors and Alpina clients.

The Jameson raiders skirmished against Boer resistance on 1 January and the next day were defeated and surrendered after losing approximately 30 men. The captured raiders were taken to Pretoria and jailed. The Boers later gave custody of the prisoners to the British for trial in London. Jameson was sentenced to 15 months and Willoughby was sentenced to 10 months. Baronetcy He became, at age seven, the 5th Baronet of Baldon House in 1866, upon the death of his father, Sir John Willoughby, 4th Baronet. The baronetcy became extinct in 1918 upon his own death.

Tank≈ç (Jap. ) is a form of Japanese armor that was common in the Kofun period.  Tank≈ç  The Tank≈ç (literally \\"little bowl‚Äú) is the first uniquely definable type of Japanese armor. Other types that were used earlier such as J√≤dai no Katch√π (ancient armor, as described by armor historian Suenaga Masao) have been mentioned, but are not entirely verifiable. The Tank≈ç was made of sheet iron and tanned leather, laced at the hips to conform to the wearer's body. The leather served as a support for the iron sheets, and as a protective lining meant to prevent damage to the wearer's clothing and skin. The iron sheets were formed into strips that were riveted side-by-side or overlapping. The carapace was built higher than the breastplate in order to provide protection for the neck. The front side had an opening that could be closed once the armor was put on. The armor was attached to the body via fabric bands that ran over the shoulders.

It is surrounded by deposits left by dry valleys that descend the Western Cordillera. These dry valleys, from mountains such as the Llullaillaco volcano, carry water only occasionally. More permanent sources of water, in the form of springs, also exist at Salar de Punta Negra. At the beginning of the Holocene era, the area was wetter than today, although the idea that Salar de Punta Negra once contained a permanent lake has been disproven. Early humans moved into the area to exploit the wetlands and left traces in the form of projectile points and archeological sites. Copper mining presently takes place in the region.  Geography and geomorphology  The Salar de Punta Negra lies in the eastern Antofagasta Region of Chile, which is an important source of copper and nitrate for the country. Before 1981, when a large mine opened in the area, access to the region was difficult. The name refers to a black lava flow on the eastern side of Salar de Punta Negra that was erupted during the Late Pleistocene. The Salar has a surface of , and is a playa with a polygonal clayey-salty surface that is in some places uplifted and occasional canals and ponds filled with saltwater. The salt deposits consist mainly of gypsum, halite and ulexite, they form crenulated rims and pressure ridges in some points. The playa appears to be somewhat asymmetric, lower in the northwest, probably a consequence of faulting. Salar de Punta Negra lies at the centre of a converging drainage network and is surrounded by a bajada which often becomes steep where it meets the playa and is itself crisscrossed by channels that originate in dry valleys at the top of the bayada. Of these dry valleys, four of these in the Western Cordillera carry water seasonally and are known as Quebrada Zorros, Quebrada Zorritos, Quebrada Tocomar (or Toconar) and Quebrada Llullaillaco. These are often subject to flash floods which occasionally reach the playa surface in the form of mudflows. Additional valleys are the Quebrada El Salto and the Quebrada El Salado. The R√≠o Frio enters the Salar from the south and gets its water from the Cordillera Domeyko. Finally, fault-controlled springs such as Barrancas Blancas and water seeps at the eastern margin of Salar de Punta Negra discharge water. It is part of a long and wide basin between the Western Cordillera with its volcanoes and the Cordillera Domeyko which has formed through tectonic processes in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic including block faulting and was then filled by Cenozoic deposits. In the Western Cordillera, the volcano Llullaillaco reaches a height of while the average elevation of the depression amounts to ; Llullaillaco is one of the highest volcanoes in the world. The basin has a surface area of about ; to the east of Salar de Punta Negra lie the Pampa El Salado, the Pampa San Eulogio and the Pampa del Chino. = Supposed paleolake = It was once believed that Salar de Punta Negra at one time contained a large lake, long, wide and deep at least. Traces of the former lake such as lacustrine sediments, river deltas, shorelines and lacustrine terraces have been found. During the latest Pleistocene-Holocene, the Quebrada de las Zorras conveyed water from the mountains around Llullaillaco to Salar de Punta Negra. The lake eventually overflowed first into the Salar de Imilac farther north and then through the Quebrada de Agua Colorada into the Salar de Atacama; archeological findings have been made in proximity to the overflow pathways. Later research indicated that there is no firm evidence of such a lake such as either lacustrine sediments or former shorelines, with supposed shorelines being instead berms formed by subsidence and faults. Likewise, typical fine sediments associated with water are only found on the eastern side of Salar de Punta Negra, where springs are active. The absence of a lake in Salar de Punta Negra is consistent with the fact that paleolakes with clear shorelines in the region only occur at elevations of over . Farther south, the Salar de Aguas Calientes and the Salar de Pajonales feature clear evidence of former lakes.  Geology  The Central Andes in Chile consist of five separate geological domains. From east to west these are the Western Cordillera with active volcanoes, the Pre-Andean Depression which contains a number of Tertiary basins such as the Salar de Atacama and the Salar de Punta Negra, the Cordillera de Domeyko, the Central Depression and finally the Cordillera de la Costa. With the exception of the Salar de Atacama, the geology of the Pre-Andean Depression is usually poorly known, as most geological research is focused on the eastern side of the Andes where oil reserves are suspected and on the copper-bearing domains of the western Andes. The area is largely covered by Cenozoic sediments and volcanic rocks, but in outcrops a number of older formations can be observed: Devonian-Carboniferous marine deposits (Zorritas Formation), pyroclastic rocks (La Tabla Formation), both of which reach thicknesses of over , 300-280 million years old plutons, the Triassic sediment-volcanic Sierra Guanaco and the fluvial-lacustrine Sierra de Varas and the marine Rhaetian-Jurassic Profeta Formation. Finally, there are Paleogene deposits of mostly sedimentary or volcanic origin such as the Naranja Formation and the Pampa de Mulas Formation. Large fault systems such as the Escondida-Punta Negra fault delimit the Salar de Punta Negra basin to the west and the east; some eastern faults offset recent deposits.  Climate and biology  The area has a cold desert climate with average temperatures of and average annual rainfall of -; precipitation diminishes from in the Western Cordillera to almost zero in the Cordillera Domeyko and occurs mostly during the summer months, leading to episodic flows in the dry valleys. Diurnal temperature variation reaches and the region is windy, with winds reaching up to and an average of . There is virtually no vegetation close to Salar de Punta Negra today, although the little plant life that does exist supports some noctuid moths, including three novel species. The area of Salar de Punta Negra is also frequented by animals such as flamingos. In the past, conversely, wetlands existed at Salar de Punta Negra, including grasses, shrubs and sedges. Snail remnants have also been found in the former wetland deposits. These wetlands disappeared around 9,700 - 8,100 calibrated radiocarbon years ago.  Human activity  While the Atacama Desert was once considered an obstacle to human habitation, many traces of past human activity have been found in it. Between 12,800 and 9,700 years ago the \\"Central Andean Pluvial Event\\" led to the formation of large lakes in the Altiplano and of wetlands in the lowlands; these wetlands acted as oases of life and also as stepping stones for the spread of early humans. During the later Holocene the climate became more arid again, the lakes and many of these wetlands disappeared again. The latest Pleistocene-early Holocene was also the time by which humans in South America had colonized all available spaces with various technological strategies; in the case of the Atacama region, this included the then-existing wetlands. At Salar de Punta Negra, human artifacts have been found at former wetlands and in other sites. Humans continued to be active at Salar de Punta Negra even after the drying of the climate, with one site close to a waterhole dated to 4,970 - 4,830 years ago via calibrated radiocarbon, although most earlier sites had been abandoned. This is consistent with the so-called \\"archeological silence\\" of this period in the Salar de Atacama area. At the Pleistocene/Holocene sites of Salar de Punta Negra, furnaces have been found which feature camelid bones, various types of tools, and projectile points. The objects found at Salar de Punta Negra resemble these found at other contemporaneous archeological sites in Peru, Ecuador, Chile and Argentina and may stem from an Archaic to pre-Paleo-Indian occupation of the area. The objects have been classified as belonging to the Fell, Tuina, and Punta Negra archaeological traditions. At Punta Negra, hunter-gatherer populations used the locally available plants and camelid animals; the tools discovered there are associated with slaughtering and hunting. Other archeological sites in the area include pircas, rock art and Inca roads such as a major Inca highway. It was built in 1485 to aid in the Inca conquest of the territory; for the Inca, the region was a source for minerals such as copper, gold and turquoise. Copper mining has continued into the present-day, associated with groundwater depletion and the drying of remnant wetlands, leading to legal restrictions in 2005 on groundwater exploration.

Casseday was born in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1840, her girlhood passed amid the surroundings of a wealthy Christian home. In 1861, she was thrown from a carriage; she survived the resulting spinal injury but was physically disabled, and in pain for the rest of her life. It was her own love of flowers in the sick-room which first suggested the Flower Mission, and when Frances E. Willard went to Louisville in 1881, she gained Casseday's consent to become superintendent of this work for the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). From that time till her death, she directed from her sick-bed world-wide plans for this philanthropy, personally conducting an immense correspondence in its interests. Besides her work in the Flower Mission, Casseday was the founder of the Jennie Casseday Infirmary, and the Louisville Training School for Nurses. Early years Jennie Casseday was born in Louisville, Kentucky, June 9, 1840. Her parents were Samuel Casseday (1795‚Äì1876) and Eliza McFarland Casseda (1800‚Äì1849). She had nine siblings including, Benjamin, S. Addison, Mary, and Fannie. Samuel Casseday Her father, Samuel, was a Virginian, a Presbyterian, and a slave owner. He was one of the wealthiest men in the city and he was constantly giving away large sums of money to charitable enterprises. He was the eldest son of Peter Casseday, who was killed in the American Revolutionary War. Her mother, Eliza, was born in Philadelphia of Ulster parents and held the British view of slavery. She donated the land on which the Presbyterian orphanage was, as well as a large sum of money with which to begin the building. Eventually, the family's slaves were freed and sent to Liberia paid for by the Cassedays. Childhood home Casseday was a normal little girl, born of rich, cultured parents who loved to give their children everything possible for happiness. She was so round, ruddy and sturdy that her big brothers called her \\"Dutch\\". That was her family nickname until she was nearly grown, until in fact it seemed pitiless to call her by it. The Casseday home was notable in its day. It stood on the corner of Fourth and Jefferson streets, where the Masonic Temple building was later built. At that time, this part of the city was considered the most fashionable residence quarter. In 1844, Samuel bought an elevated plateau in the heart of Louisville and built a big house, providing winter romp-rooms for his daughters and a completely furnished carpenter shop for his son. This wise provision kept his children at home and also supplied companionship with the boys and girls of his friends. Eliza, the mother, died in 1849 when Casseday was nine years of age. Immediately after this, Miss Mary Ann McNutt, Eliza's half-sister, took charge of the household, so continuing in authority as long as the father lived; afterwards, until her own death, keeping the family together. When Cassedy was well in her 'teens, Aunt McNutt called her \\"Miss Gadabout\\". Casseday's intense love for flowers, and for all nature, was an inheritance from her mother. The spacious grounds of the residence were laid off in figures and wide serpentine walks, with rare trees and flowers. There was a high stone retaining wall with a plantation border which was filled with lilacs, peonies, altheas, weigelias, golden elder, barberry bushes, calacanthus and moss roses. There were broad stretches of bluegrass, ending in circles and squares and half moons of roses. Just before Casseday graduated from school, her years of too intensive study exerted her brain, and a fever drifted for months. After that came a period of happy young womanhood, of boyfriends, travel, and social life. In 1861, she was the victim of a terrible accident brought about by runaway horses, an overturned carriage, her body dragged along under the wheels, and maimed forever. Career Casseday kept a diary in which she wrote each night the blessings of the day as they had been experienced by her. Its first page was headed with this quotation: \\"Count your blessings, one by one.\\" Under it she had written: \\"I cannot. They rush upon me like waters from a gargoyle.\\" =Flower Mission= Jennie Casseday From its initial number, The New York Observer, the most notable religious paper of its day, had been taken in the family home. In 1869, it was full of the story of a young Boston woman, teaching in Roxbury, Massachusetts, who, as she passed from place to place, noticed the great waste of flowers and fruits in the gardens of the rich, most notable when the owners were absent, or in summer. Sometimes, the teacher was given a bunch of roses and these she invariably gave them away to the children of the streets, children of poverty. Later she secured baskets of flowers and small fruits and made little detours on her way to school, so as to reach even the poorer districts. It was a simple act, simply done. This story fired the heart of Casseday, as she lay there in her bed. Day and night she thought of the young teacher of Roxbury. Her vision grew deeper and wider, and she came to realize the possibilities of such a ministry, and she developed a plan. She called to her bedside the influential women of Louisville, recognizing that what she hoped to create demanded team work and organization. Those whom she called came and plans were perfected at her bedside. A public meeting was arranged. Editors offered their columns; reporters did their best to float her project in a favororable fashion, and The Courier-Journal presented the use of a large room in its building with tables ready for tying up flowers. By the time of the first going forth, this room was crowded with flower missionaries and the tables heaped with flowers. It did not take long for the story of the Louisville Flower Mission, and its invalid designer to get abroad. Letters came to Casseday from all over the world until Flower Missions were inaugurated in forty different U.S. states and countries. It was but a short step from the local Flower Mission to criminals confined in prisons. Jennie, herself confined to narrow quarters, soon began thinking of all sorts of \\"prisoners\\" and began planning to send the message of the flowers to States Prisons. Her board co-operated with her loyally and gladly. Her birthday, June 9, was set apart as Flower Mission Prison Day. By this time, Flower Missions had grown up in most of the U.S. States and large plans were made to visit all State and local prisons and reformatories on June 9. The co-operation of officers of prisons was secured beforehand, the number of prisoners learned, and it was asked that prisoners be asked to assemble in their chapels at a fixed hour. It was arranged to present each prisoner with a bouquet made of \\"something white, something bright, something sweet.\\" A requisite was that each bouquet must have a text of scripture attached to it by a fine wire. Jennie herself selected a large number of texts and had them printed. But a missionary was at liberty to choose her own texts and write them with a pen. In fact Jennie thought the latter way might seem more personal and might bring good to the selector, as well as to the one for whom it was intended. In 1889, the \\"Society of Christian Workers\\" held its annual meeting in New York City and its secretary requested Casseday to send to it information regarding her Flower Mission work. She responded by sending a letter, which was read from the platform. There was at once a large demand for copies of this and it was soon put in booklet form for the convenience of all who wanted to know about this public service:‚Äî At the next meeting of the National WCTU, in 1881, Willard spoke of Casseday and the Flower Missions. Then she proposed Casseday as \\"first Superintendent of a new department of the WCTU‚Äîthe Flower Mission Department.\\" She was unanimously elected, and in a short while she was elected to be Superintendent of the World's WCTU Flower Mission, which she held until her death. Just fifteen years after Casseday had become President of the National Flower Mission, her Department reported to the National Convention of the WCTU that the Flower Mission Department had distributed more than 1,555,466 bouquets, 34,972 growing plants, 403,691 text cards, 1,398,122 pages of Flower Mission literature, 38,350 tumblers and jars of jelly and preserves, 15,788 bushels of fruit and vegetables, and 134,211 articles of clothing; 317,735 visits had been made to the poor and sick, besides 14,262 to public institutions, while 19,505 drives and outings were given to poor children, invalids and other worthy people. =Other public service work= Caseseday's second large welfare work was to establish from her bedside an Order of King's Daughters in Louisville. It was a new conception of service at that time‚Äî new even in New York where it originated, and wholly unknown in Kentucky or the South. Casseday's sister told her the story of how the Order began, and how its basic motive was TO BE rather than TO DO, the Doing to spring spontaneously out of the Being. Casseday at once had a desire to help this movement. She thought over the personalities of those whom she always depended upon for co-operation in her schemes; and the personality of Jennie Benedict appealed to her as the one best fitted and equipped for the task. Benedict came at Casseday at her call and they conferred over Ways. They were never women to worry over Means. They examined the value of a proposed Christian work, weighed it, planned it out, and then simply expected the Means would arrive. At Casseday's bedside, she, her sister, and Benedict laid the foundations for the work of the King's Daughters in Louisville‚Äîa work which soon spread over Kentucky, then all over the Southland. Casseday was a co- organizer of the Lying-In Hospital for Pregnant Women of Small Means which was established in 1882. She founded a nursing school in Louisville in 1889. The district nurse work owed its establishment to Casseday's philanthropy, an outgrowth of contact with the sick poor through the flower mission. The training school for nurses was successfully operated for several years. In speaking of the training school for nurses, established in Louisville, Casseday says: \\"It was born in my heart through the ministry of suffering and a longing to help others, as was my connection with the Shut-In Band.\\" The members of the Shut-In Hand consisted of men, women and children who are shut in by disease from the outside world, and of invalids who seldom or never left their rooms or beds. The name was selected from the sixteenth verse of the seventeenth chapter of the Book of Genesis: \\"And the Lord shut them in.\\" These invalids wrote to one another and had an official organ, the Open Window, which contained letters and news for invalids. This band grew from three members to many thousands, living in all parts of the world. Casseday took much interest in that work and wrote many letters to her invalid friends. Another philanthropy was the opening of Rest Cottage, as a country home for tired girls and women who have to support themselves. There they could obtain good comfortable board at a week and rest from their worries for a week or two, entertained by Casseday herself. Shortly before her death, the King's Daughters established a Jennie Casseday Free Infirmary in Louisville, which was to benefit poor and sick women. She died February 8, 1893, Louisville, and was buried at Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville.

It was the group's final appearance as a foursome outside of the US and also the last full filming of a Doors concert. The concert was remixed by long-time Doors engineer/co-producer Bruce Botnick in 5.1 Dolby Digital sound from the original multi-track audio tapes. Concert film of the band was also color-corrected and visually upgraded for release. The band's performances of \\"The End\\" and \\"When the Music's Over\\" are featured in Message to Love, a feature documentary film of the 1970 festival. A live version of \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side)\\" was featured in the soundtrack for When You're Strange, a 2009 documentary about the Doors. The DVD/Blu-Ray Disc of the concert includes This is the End a 17-minute film containing interviews with Doors' guitarist Robby Krieger, drummer John Densmore, concert director Murray Lerner, and original Doors manager Bill Siddons. A 2002 interview recorded with Ray Manzarek, the Doors keyboardist, who died in 2013 is also included. Recording The Isle of Wight Festival had some 600,000 attendees and the Doors hit the stage at two o'clock in the morning on August 30, 1970. Their set was particularly dark due to lead singer Jim Morrison not wanting film spotlights to be used. Much of the recording sees the group bathed in a single red spotlight.

Hanging over Morrison was his trial for lewd and lascivious behavior from a March 1, 1969, concert in Miami. Less than a month after this concert, on September 20, Morrison was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail, with hard labor, and fined $500. Morrison appealed but died in July 1971 before the matter was legally resolved. Densmore said of Morrison, \\"He was like a pot of boiling water with a lid on top. He didn't move a lot, but he sang really strong.\\" Manzarek said of the show, \\"Our set was subdued but very intense. We played with a controlled fury and Jim was in fine vocal form. He sang for all he was worth, but moved nary a muscle.

The KIR genes are polymorphic, which means that they have many different alleles. The KIR genes are also extremely homologous, which means that they are similar in position, structure and evolutionary origin, but not necessarily in function. Natural killer (NK) cells are an important component of innate antiviral immune response. Have the ability to lyse target cells without prior sensitization antigen and regulate the immune responses by secreting chemokine adaptive and cytokines. Activation of NK cells is determined by integration of inhibitory signals and activating issued by several families of different receptors, including immunoglobulin-like killer cell receptors (KIR) that predominantly recognize antigens of class I human leukocyte antigen ( HLA).  Structure and location  The genes responsible for coding of KIR proteins are found along the 19th chromosome section 19q 13.4 within the 1Mb Leukocyte Receptor Complex(LRC). The subsets of the KIR proteins are classified by their number of extracellular IG domains and by whether they have a long (L) or short(S) cytoplasmic domain-tail. The number coming at the end of the name of protein classifies it as a branch of the subset it belongs to.  Function  KIR proteins with long tailed cytoplasmic domains transduce the inhibitory signals upon the ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM), whereas the KIR proteins of short- tailed cytoplasmic domain lack the ITIM and instead associate with Tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYRO) to transduce activating signals. The ligands for several KIR proteins are subsets of HLA class I molecules. The KIR proteins are thought to play an important role in regulating of the immune responses. The HLA molecules are human leukocyte antigens and are the gene complexes to encode Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins in human beings. Plays a great role in regulating the immune response. HLA are polymorphic, thus the MHCs of humans differ from an individual to another. KIR2DL3 is a protein complex of two extracellular domains and a long tailed endo-cellular cytoplasmatic tail, which assign it in charge of sending inhbitory signals throughout the cell.  Pathology  The protein KIR2DL3 transduces inhibitory signals upon the ligand binding via an immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif(ITIM) to its long inner cytoplasmic tail. The tyrosine kinase based transductions are enzymatic transferences of a phosphate group from an ATP molecule to a protein in the cell. Thus functioning as an ' on ' and ' off ' switch in many cellular functions. Tyrosine Kinases are a sub-class of the protein-kinase. Phosphorylation of proteins is a necessary step in transduction of signals withina cell in order to regulate the cellular activity. Protein Kinases might get stuck in ' off ' position and inhibit the cell reproduction for good, or on the contrary might get stuck in ' on 'position, thus rendering the cell to reproduce unregulatedly, which is a necessary step for the development of cancer.

It runs for an almost completely straight length, except for a small kink shortly before its southern extremity. The street is approximately 1,500 metres long and lies in a south easterly direction from the Perleberger Strasse near the Fenn Bridge, to the west of, and parallel to the disused Lehrter railway complex which was disbanded in the 1950s. It joins the Invalidenstra√üe a few hundred metres from the new Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin's central railway station), near the site of the former Invalidenstra√üe East-West Berlin Cold War checkpoint. The street consists of 75 houses numbered in horseshoe fashion. After the Invalidenstrasse intersection the traffic route continues south on Clara-Jaschk Strasse. Formerly called Torfstra√üe running in a straight north-south direction, it was bisected by the construction of the railway line. The southern part beginning at the junction with the Perlebergerstrasse received its new name, Lehrterstra√üe on 6 August 1872 on the commissioning of the Lehrter railway station in 1871. A number of the buildings in the street have been placed under historical monument protection. History In the 19th century, the west side of Lehrter Stra√üe was largely barracks, officers' residences and a parade ground. On the eastern side, the facilities of the Lehrter railway lines ran behind or over prison grounds and military buildings. Accommodation was provided for the railway employees and at the beginning of the 20th century the residential tenement buildings were constructed . A military complex of nine buildings was built around 1900 on the parade ground in Berlin's Moabit district by the Prussian army. After the Second World War, the complex was no longer needed and from the 1970s, the empty houses being on the edge of West Berlin near the wall fell largely abandoned and became partly derelict. The Lehrterstra√üe prison. (Engraving from around 1855) Before the opening of the Olympia Stadium for the 1936 Olympics, the listed Poststadion built in 1929 for the sports club of the German Reichspost at the site of a former Prussian Uhlan parade ground, was Berlin's major stadium with a capacity of 55,000 spectators. Undergoing an ongoing programme of restoration since 2003, the Poststadion and its sport park is one of the city's largest sport complexes. By the 1970s due to a plan to lay an urban expressway through the neighbourhood; the late 19th and early 20th century, partly derelict, traditional working class tenements, warehouses, and factories were mostly empty. The plan was shelved and by the end of the 1970s , the houses on the northern end of the street began to be occupied by squatters, a Hells Angels chapter, and a vibrant community of struggling artists, musicians, and students. On the reunification of Germany in 1990, Lehrterstra√üe suddenly found itself in the centre of the reunited city. The old buildings, some of which had previously been slated for demolition, were restored and renovated, even before the road was designated as a redevelopment area. In 2010, two hotels were built, and terraced houses with small gardens were built on the corner of Seydlitzstrasse. S-Bahn station shortly before demolition in 2002. The new central station can be seen behind it The district office in the center of Berlin has drawn up development plans for a new district behind the historic brick wall of the former railway site. This would take in most of the large derelict railway yard on the eastern side of the Lehrterstra√üe which is currently home to 34 garden allotments and other railway buildings, The Berlin City Mission built an office and congress center at Lehrterstra√üe 68 near the southern end of the road, and also runs a collection depot for donated clothing in the basement. Lehrterstra√üe prison in 2007 The largest building in the ensemble - the former uniform clothing factory at Lehrterstra√üe 57 - was converted and refurbished by Sauerbruch Hutton, an international architecture and design firm, between 2008 and extended in 2010. Outside, the historic listed brick facade remains while inside, the most modern techniques and materials for optimal use have been employed in order to address today's requirements. The new Mittenmang quarter The new Mittenmang quarter under construction 2018 On the eastern side of the middle section of the road between the sports facilities at the Poststadion and the Europacity on the 3.7 hectares of the former railway depot of the since 1952 obsolete Lehrter station, a new city subdistrict, Mittenmang, with about 1000 rental and condominiums and the associated urban infrastructure, is being developed as of 2018. The proposal has not been entirely well-received by the local population due to its upmarket costs. Conservation The tenement at No. 48 Several buildings in the street have been placed under historical monument protection: the prison, the houses 6 to 10, and 27 to 30; the house at No.48, a tenement block; built in 1894. The former Berlin Royal Military Clothing Department made uniforms at No.57 and 58. The Werthheim House at No. 35 was a factory and warehouse of the Wertheim company.

Transport The Lehrter Stra√üe is served in its length by the bus route 123.The nearest U-Bahn station (tube/subway) for the northern end is Birkenstrasse on Line U9, about a 15 minute walk from the street's junction with the Perlebergerstrasse. The southern end of the Lehrterstrasse is served directly by the Berlin Central Station which in addition to it main railway lines, includes the S-Bahn (a surface metro railway) Lines S3,S5, S7, and S9; the U-Bahn Line U55, and tram (Metrotram) lines M5, M8, and M10.

It has narrowly to broadly oval leaves of 2¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1.0‚Äì1.6 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.8 in) wide, on the upper parts of the branches, the lower parts leafless with a reddish brown bark. The inflorescences at the top of the shoots are cylinder-shaped, 10‚Äì40 cm (4‚Äì16 in) long and contain forty to one hundred twenty densely crowded flower heads, at a steep upward angle, hiding a crest of very small, almost vertical leaves. The flower heads each consist of three, rarely four individual flowers. The flowers are tightly enclosed by four or five orange-yellow, fleshy, pointy, lance-shaped involucral bracts, and three orange-yellow, 4‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.6‚Äì2.4 in) long bracteoles. It grows on always moist, south-facing slopes in the southern coastal mountains of South Africa. Flowers can be found from August to November, with a peak in September.  Description  Mimetes pauciflorus is an evergreen shrub, that develops from a main stem of up to 5 cm (2 in) in diameter. It initially produces shyly branching, vigorous, upright, felty shoots, of 6‚Äì8 mm (¬º‚Äì‚Öì in) thick, that grow about ¬Ω m (1¬Ω ft) per year. Later, growth slows down and inflorescences are produced, while leaves will have been shed from the older parts of the shoots, revealing the smooth reddish brown bark. Plants eventually may reach a height of 2‚Äì4 m (6¬Ω‚Äì13 ft). The leathery leaves are alternately set, at an upward angle and overlapping and lack both stipules and a leaf stalks. The leaves are narrow to broadly oval with an entire margin and a blunt thickened tip, 2¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1.0‚Äì1.6 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.8 in) wide. Its surface has rather few felty hairs and a fringe of felty hairy. The inflorescences at the top of the shoots are cylinder-shaped, are 10‚Äì40 cm (4‚Äì16 in) long and contain forty to one hundred twenty densely crowded flower heads, at a steep upward angle, hiding a crest of very small, almost vertical leaves. The flower heads consist of three, rarely four individual flowers and sit in the axils of inconspicuous, ordinary, flat, green leaves. The four to five bracts that tightly enclose the flower heads are orange-yellow, fleshy, lance-shaped with a pointy tip, 1‚Äì2¬Ω cm (0.4‚Äì1.0 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) wide, the outer hairless, the inner softly hairy at the tip. The bracts that subtend the individual flowers are lance-shaped with a pointy tip, 4‚Äì5¬Ω cm (1.6‚Äì2.4 in) long and 1¬Ω‚Äì1¬Ω cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) wide, hairless at base but felty hairy near the tip. The straight cream-coloured 4-merous perianth is 4¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1.8‚Äì2.0 in) long. The lower part called tube, that remains merged when the flower is open, is 2‚Äì3 mm (0.08‚Äì0.12 in) long, cartilaginous, expanded bulb-like near its base and hairless. The four segments in the middle part (or claws), are thread-shaped and carry some long, straight, spreading hairs. The bright red segments in the upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud, are very narrowly line-shaped with a pointy tip, 5‚Äì6 mm (0.20‚Äì0.24 in) long, and hairless. The four anthers lack a filament and are directly connected to the limbs. From the center of the perianth emerges a style of 4¬Ω‚Äì5 cm (1¬æ‚Äì2 in) long, that tapers towards the pollen presenter. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is threat- to line-shaped with a pointy tip, 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) long, with a slight ring at its base, and the groove that functions as the stigma across the very tip. The ovary is egg-shaped, densely powdery hairy, about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, and is subtended by four blunt, oblong scales of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long. It eventually develops into a cylinder-shaped fruit of about 7 mm (0.28 in) long and 3¬Ω mm (0.14 in) in diameter. In M. pauciflora, the number of flowers per head is reduced down to three (rarely four), and the involucral bracts are short. The bright yellow bracteoles of the three flowers together form a long, straight an narrow tube, from which only the perianth limbs and pollen presenters extend. The tube-type flower head functions comparable to tube-shaped corollas, such as in the large- flowered Erica species. The three-flowered pagoda is the only Mimetes species with these so-called tube-type flower heads. = Differences with related species = The three-flowered pagoda can be distinguished from other Mimetes species by the entire, oval leaves and only three flowers per orange-yellow coloured head.  Taxonomy  M. pauciflorus in a vegetation with Brunia lanuginosaThe three-flowered pagoda was described by Robert Brown in a paper called On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae, and called it Mimetes pauciflorus in 1810. He had based it on a specimen that had been collected by William Roxburgh in Africa Australis. Following Linnaeus in his preference to have larger genera, Jean Louis Marie Poiret reassigned the species, creating Protea pauciflora. Based on another specimen, from Montagu Pass, Michel Gandoger and Hans Schinz in 1913 described M. rehmanni, honoring its collector, the Polish explorer and botanist Anton Rehmann. John Patrick Rourke in 1984 regarded both types as belonging to the same species.  Distribution and habitat  Mimetes pauciflorus has a relatively large distribution. It can be found in an at most wide strip along the south-facing slopes of the coastal mountains along the south coast, between the Ruitersberg, north of Mossel Bay in the Western Cape to slightly beyond Formosa Peak in the Eastern Cape. It occurs in South Outeniqua Sandstone Fynbos and Tsitsikamma Sandstone Fynbos, a very dense and high vegetation type, together with species like Brunia lanuginosa, Erica hispidula, Leucadendron conicum, L. eucalyptifolium and Widdringtonia cupressoides. It can be found on slopes at 450‚Äì1400 m (1500‚Äì4600 ft) altitude, which are moist year-round and receive at least 1000 mm (40 in) of precipitation per year.Flower heads can be found from August to November, peaking in September. It is assumed that like other Mimetes species, the three-flowered pagoda is pollinated by birds and the seeds are distributed by ants.  Conservation  The three-flowered pagoda is considered a vulnerable species due to a loss of habitat of over 30% converted into forest. Further threats may be competition by invasive species, and gathering of the flowers.

The Penney-Missouri Awards were often described as the \\"Pulitzer Prize of feature writing\\". They were the only nationwide recognition specifically for women's page journalists, at a time when few women had other opportunities to write or edit for newspapers. History The Penney-Missouri awards were conceived by James Cash Penney, founder of the J. C. Penney retail chain, who hoped improving women's page sections would turn them into more effective advertising channels for his stores. Penney established the award at the University of Missouri because he believed the school had the necessary prestige. Kimberly Wilmot Voss's research suggests that as early as 1960, when the awards were established, women's page sections were reporting on a broader range of issues than expected, often creating the kind of coverage the awards were intended to encourage: \\"more than just society notices and photographs of brides\\".

At the time of the opening the Hospital already had 25 child patients. It was renamed The Infants Hospital in 1904 and it moved to purpose-built accommodation in Vincent Square in 1907. The Duchess of Albany had laid a memorial stone in May 1907 and she returned on 20 November 1907 to formally open the new building which had wards for 50 children. The building and equipping of the hospital had been paid for by Sir Robert Mond as a memorial to his late wife. An outpatients department was opened by the Duchess of Albany in 1914 and it joined the National Health Service as the Westminster Children's Hospital in 1948. After services were transferred to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, the Westminster Children's Hospital closed in 1995. The building has since been converted to luxury apartments.

It is located at a distance of circa 70 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 615 is about 75,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on January 10, 1785. NGC 615 belongs to the NGC 584 galaxy group, which also includes the galaxies NGC 584, NGC 596, NGC 600, and NGC 636. The galaxy is included in the Herschel 400 Catalogue. It lies about three degrees northeast from Theta Ceti.  Characteristics  The galaxy has been found to possess a chemically and dynamically decoupled nucleus. Further observations revealed two decoupled components, with the outer one identified as a disk. In the centre of the galaxy (<3\\" / 0.3 kpc) was found to exist an inclined circumnuclear disk. The stars in the circumnuclear disk have solar metallicity and their median age was determined at 5 billion years. In the bulge of NGC 615 (3\\"-6\\") was detected a counterrotating gaseous component. Further away of the centre (8-30\\") lies the inner decoupled component, where stars and gas rotate together. The axis of the photometric component is turned and thus it was identified as a separate inner compact disk of oval shape. This disk contains HII regions, with the most prominent of them in HŒ± imaging being a pair located symmetrically with respect to the nucleus at the radius of 20\\"-23\\". The mean stellar age in the inner disk outside the HII regions is 5 billion years. The presence of a chemically decoupled nucleus and inner disk suggest a secondary burst of star formation, perhaps provoked by the close passage of another galaxy some gigayears ago. The outer disk demonstrates a pair of low- contrast outer spiral arms or, more likely, a ring. Its inclination with respect to the line of sight is no more than 60¬∞.

The original magazine was created on an old Remington typewriter, late at night so no one would hear, and distributed through cyclostyle. It was rebooted in 1993 by Counsel Club, a newly-formed support group for gender and sexual minorities. Counsel Club published another six issues between 1993 and 1996, and the magazine continued on until the final issue published in 2000, when it was a Bengali tabloid. The magazine was renamed Naya Pravartak in 1995, and that name was used until the publication ended in 2000. The magazine was distributed almost entirely through private circulation, via word of mouth among LGBTQ people, community institutions and events, and via the Counsel club meetings. A few copies were distributed through Classic Books and Seagull Bookstore in Kolkata, and People Tree in New Delhi.

Gooding (15 April 1931 - 1 October 2018) was a British professional boxer. After winning several amateur titles, he was selected to represent Great Britain in the men's middleweight event at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. After winning his first bout, he was eliminated in the second round. He turned professional in 1954, enjoying a strong start to his career by winning his first 12 bouts and earning a Welsh light-heavyweight title bout against Ken Rowlands, which he lost. After a second defeat, he retired from professional boxing. Career=Amateur= Gooding was born in Cardiff, Wales. He began boxing at the age of nine and enjoyed a successful youth career. He was chosen to represent Wales for the first time at the age of 17, winning his debut bout in Dublin. In the following year, he reached final of the Welsh Amateur Boxing Association middleweight division and won the Welsh Senior Youth title. In 1952, having begun his National Service, Gooding won the army and inter-services championship and returned to the ABA championships where he was victorious. His form resulted in him being selected for the Great Britain boxing team to represent the nation at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland at the age of 21. One of only two Welsh fighters in the squad, along with Dai Dower, Gooding was the only member of the squad selected without a trial. At the Games, Golding was drawn against Egyptian fighter Moustafa Fahim in the first round, defeating his opponent via a judges decision. In the second round, Gooding fought Bulgarian Boris Nikolov but was eliminated after losing the fight by decision. =Professional= Gooding completed his National Service in 1953 and had no plans to continue his boxing career. However, he was convinced to turn professional by boxing manager Sam Burns and won his first professional fight in May 1954 against Mick Endley by decision. Including his victory over Endley, Gooding won his first 12 bouts in his first year as a professional. His record saw him ranked as the number four light-heavyweight in Britain and prompted a Welsh title bout against fellow Welshman Ken Rowlands. However, Rowlands won the fight by TKO after the referee stopped the fight in the sixth round. Gooding suffered a second defeat against Arthur Howard three months later and retired from boxing. Personal life Gooding met his wife Audrey during his boxing career; the pair married in September 1957 at St. Alan's Church in Splott. The couple had two children together, Paul and Debbie. After retiring from Boxing, Gooding worked as a construction manager and started two companies, Sibex and TG Engineering International. He died in October 2018 at the age of 87.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly cognitive and emotional. This results from the way participation in a creative process and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held beliefs, accompanied by unfamiliar feelings, which alters perception of the world, oneself, and others.Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96. The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367. Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought personal comfort, self-reflection, and group cohesion for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of John Dewey.Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34. Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and behave. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company. Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual introspection,Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015.

Over the last three decades, the Arctic Ocean has experienced drastic changes due to climate change. One of the changes is in the acidity levels of the ocean, which have been consistently increasing at twice the rate of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Arctic Ocean acidification is a result of feedback from climate system mechanisms, and is having negative impacts on Arctic Ocean ecosystems and the organisms that live within them.  Process  Ocean acidification is caused by the equilibration of the atmosphere with the ocean, a process that occurs worldwide. Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere equilibrates and dissolves into the ocean. During this reaction, carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid. The carbonic acid then dissociates into bicarbonate ions and hydrogen ions. This reaction causes the pH of the water to lower, effectively acidifying it. Ocean acidification is occurring in every ocean across the world. Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the World's oceans have absorbed approximately 525 billion tons of carbon dioxide. During this time, world ocean pH has collectively decreased from 8.2 to 8.1, with climatic modeling predicting a further decrease of pH by 0.3 units by 2100. However, the Arctic Ocean has been affected more due to the cold water temperatures and increased solubility of gases as water temperature decreases. The cold Arctic water is able to absorb higher amounts of carbon dioxide compared to the warmer Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. The chemical changes caused by the acidification of the Arctic Ocean are having negative ecological and socioeconomic repercussions. With the changes in the chemistry of their environment, arctic organisms are challenged with new stressors. These stressors can have damaging effects on these organisms, with some being affected more than others. Calcifying organisms specifically appear to be the most impacted by this changing water composition, as they rely on carbonate availability to survive. Dissolved carbonate concentrations decrease with increasing carbon dioxide and lowered pH in the water. Ecological food webs are also altered by the acidification. Acidification lowers the ability of many fish to grow, which not only impacts food webs but humans that rely on these fisheries as well. Economic effects are resulting from shifting food webs that decrease popular fish populations. These fish populations provide jobs to people who work in the fisheries industry. As is apparent, ocean acidification lacks any positive benefits, and as a result has been placed high on a priority list within the United States and other organizations such as the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research, UNESCO‚Äôs Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, the Ocean Carbon and Biogeochemistry Program, the Integrated Marine Biogeochemistry and Ecosystem Research Project, and the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.  Causes  Annual Arctic Sea Ice Minimum = Decreased sea ice = Arctic sea ice has experienced an extreme reduction over the past few decades, with the minimum area of sea ice being 4.32 million km2 in 2019, a sharp 38% decrease from 1980, when the minimum area was 7.01 million km2. Sea ice plays an important role in the health of the Arctic Ocean, and its decline has had detrimental effects on Arctic Ocean chemistry. All oceans equilibrate with the atmosphere by pulling carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and into the ocean, which lowers the pH of the water. Sea ice limits the air-sea gas exchange with carbon dioxide by protecting the water from being completely exposed to the atmosphere. Low carbon dioxide levels are important to the Arctic Ocean due to intense cooling, fresh water runoff, and photosynthesis from marine organisms. Reductions in sea ice have allowed more carbon dioxide to equilibrate with the arctic water, resulting in increased acidification. The decrease in sea ice has also allowed more Pacific Ocean water to flow into in the Arctic Ocean during the winter, called Pacific winter water. Pacific Ocean water is high in carbon dioxide, and with decreased amounts of sea ice, more Pacific Ocean water has been able to enter the Arctic Ocean, carrying carbon dioxide with it. This Pacific winter water has further acidified the Arctic Ocean, as well as increased the depth of acidified water. = Melting methane hydrates = Climate change is causing destabilization of multiple climate systems within the Arctic Ocean. One system that climate change is impacting is methane hydrates. Methane hydrates are located along the continental margins, and are stabilized by high pressure, as well as uniformly low temperatures. Climate change has begun to destabilize these methane hydrates within the Arctic Ocean by decreasing pressure and increasing temperatures, allowing methane hydrates to melt and release methane into the arctic waters. When methane is released into the water, it can either be used via anaerobic metabolism or aerobic metabolism by microorganisms in the ocean sediment, or be released from sea into the atmosphere. Most impactful to ocean acidification is aerobic oxidation by microorganisms in the water column. Carbon dioxide is produced by the reaction of methane and oxygen in water. Carbon dioxide then equilibrates with water, producing carbonic acid, which then equilibrates to release hydrogen ions and bicarbonate and further contributes to ocean acidification.  Effects on Arctic organisms  Organisms in Arctic waters are under high environmental stress such as extremely cold water. It is believed that this high stress environment will cause ocean acidification factors to have a stronger affect on these organisms. It could also cause these effects to appear in the Arctic before it appears in other parts of the ocean. There is a significant variation in the sensitivity of marine organisms to increased ocean acidification. Calcifying organisms generally exhibit larger negative responses from ocean acidification than non‚Äêcalcifying organisms across numerous response variables, with the exception of crustaceans, which calcify but don't seem to be negatively affected. This is due, mainly, to the process of marine biogenic calcification, that calcifying organisms utilize. = Calcifying organisms = Carbonate ions (CO‚ÇÉ¬≤‚Åª) are essential in marine calcifying organisms, like plankton and shellfish, as they are required to produce their calcium carbonate (CaCO‚ÇÉ) shells and skeletons. As the ocean acidifies, the increased uptake of CO2 by seawater increases the concentration of hydrogen ions, which lowers the pH of the water. This change in the chemical equilibrium of the inorganic carbon system reduces the concentration of these carbonate ions. This reduces the ability of these organisms to create their shells and skeletons.Pterapod shell dissolved in seawater adjusted to an ocean chemistry projected for the year 2100 The two polymorphs of calcium carbonate that are produced by marine organisms are aragonite and calcite. These are the materials that makes up most of the shells and skeletons of these calcifying organisms. Aragonite, for example, makes up nearly all mollusc shells, as well as the exoskeleton of corals. The formation of these materials is dependent on the saturation state of CaCO3 in ocean water. Waters which are saturated in CaCO‚ÇÉ are favorable to precipitation and formation of CaCO‚ÇÉ shells and skeletons, but waters which are undersaturated are corrosive to CaCO‚ÇÉ shells. In the absence of protective mechanisms, dissolution of calcium carbonate will occur. As colder arctic water absorbs more CO‚ÇÇ, the concentration of CO‚ÇÉ¬≤‚Åª is reduced, therefore the saturation of calcium carbonate is lower in high-latitude oceans than it is in tropical or temperate oceans. The undersaturation of CaCO3 causes the shells of calcifying organisms to dissolve, which can have devastating consequences to the ecosystem. As the shells dissolve, the organisms struggle to maintain proper health, which can lead to mass mortality. The loss of many of these species can lead to intense consequences on the marine food web in the Arctic Ocean, as many of these marine calcifying organisms are keystone species. Laboratory experiments on various marine biota in an elevated CO‚ÇÇ environment show that changes in aragonite saturation cause substantial changes in overall calcification rates for many species of marine organisms, including coccolithophore, foraminifera, pteropods, mussels, and clams. Although the undersaturation of arctic water has been proven to have an effect on the ability of organisms to precipitate their shells, recent studies have shown that the calcification rate of calcifiers, such as corals, coccolithophores, foraminiferans and bivalves, decrease with increasing pCO‚ÇÇ, even in seawater supersaturated with respect to CaCO‚ÇÉ. Additionally, increased pCO‚ÇÇ has been found to have complex effects on the physiology, growth and reproductive success of various marine calcifiers.  Life cycle  A sea urchin, cracked open to reveal its eggs inside. These eggs hold the embryo stage of this organism. CO‚ÇÇ tolerance seems to differ between various marine organisms, as well as CO‚ÇÇ tolerance at different life cycle stages (e.g. larva and adult). The first stage in the life cycle of marine calcifiers at serious risk from high CO2 content is the planktonic larval stage. The larval development of several marine species, primarily sea urchins and bivalves, are highly affected by elevations of seawater pCO‚ÇÇ. In laboratory tests, numerous sea urchin embryos were reared under different CO‚ÇÇ concentrations until they developed to the larval stage. It was found that once they reached this stage, larval and arm sizes were significantly smaller, as well as abnormal skeleton morphology was noted with increasing pCO‚ÇÇ. Similar findings have been found in CO‚ÇÇ treated-mussel larvae, which showed a larval size decrease of about 20% and showed morphological abnormalities such as convex hinges, weaker and thinner shells and protrusion of mantle. The larval body size also impacts the encounter and clearance rates of food particles, and if larval shells are smaller or deformed, these larvae are more prone to starvation.CaCO‚ÇÉ structures also serve vital functions for calcified larvae, such as defense against predation, as well as roles in feeding, buoyancy control and pH regulation. Another example of a species which may be seriously impacted by ocean acidification is Pteropods, which are shelled pelagic molluscs which play an important role in the food-web of various ecosystems. Since they harbour an aragonitic shell, they could be very sensitive to ocean acidification driven by the increase of anthropogenic CO‚ÇÇ emissions. Laboratory tests showed that calcification exhibits a 28% decrease of the pH value of the Arctic ocean expected for the year 2100, compared to the present pH value. This 28% decline of calcification in the lower pH condition is within the range reported for other calcifying organisms such as corals. In contrast with sea urchin and bivalve larvae, corals and marine shrimps are more severely impacted by ocean acidification after settlement, while they developed into the polyp stage. From laboratory tests, the morphology of the CO‚ÇÇ-treated polyp endoskeleton of corals was disturbed and malformed compared to the radial pattern of control polyps. This variability in the impact of ocean acidification on different life cycle stages of different organisms can be partially explained by the fact that most echinoderms and mollusks start shell and skeleton synthesis at their larval stage, while corals start at the settlement stage. Hence, these stages are highly susceptible to the potential effects of ocean acidification.Most calcifiers, such as corals, echinoderms, bivalves and crustaceans, play important roles in coastal ecosystems as keystone species, bioturbators and ecosystem engineers. The food web in the arctic ocean is somewhat truncated, meaning it is short and simple. Any impacts to key species in the food web can cause exponentially devastating effects on the rest of the food chain as a whole, as they will no longer have a reliable food source. If these larger organisms no longer have any source of nutrients, they too will eventually die off, and the entire Arctic ocean ecosystem will be affected. This would have a huge impact on the arctic people who catch arctic fish for a living, as well as the economic repercussions which would follow such a major shortage of food and living income for these families.

Based on the Lamborghini Aventador, the Veneno was developed to celebrate Lamborghini's 50th anniversary. It was introduced at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show. When introduced, it had a price of , making it one of the most expensive production cars in the world. The prototype, Car Zero, is finished in Grigio Telesto (medium grey) and includes an Italian flag vinyl on both sides of the car.  Specifications  Rear view The engine is a development of the Aventador's 6.5-litre V12 and generates a power output of at 8,400 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm. The increase in power was achieved by enlarging the air intakes and modifying the exhaust system. The Veneno is Lamborghini's interpretation of a racing prototype built for the road. The front of the car is designed for maximum airflow and for improved downforce. The redesigned front and rear arches direct air around the car in order to reduce excessive lift and aid in generating downforce. The smooth underbody ensures that the airflow is not interrupted. The large carbon-fibre rear wing connected to the car via an LMP- style central fin is three-way adjustable. The wheels of the car (measuring 20-inch at the front and 21-inch at the rear) have a turbine-like design and direct air to cool the car's carbon ceramic braking system. The center lock wheels allow for easy installation and removal. The car utilises Pirelli P-Zero tyres. The Veneno retains the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis with aluminium front and rear subframe from the Aventador along with the pushrod suspension system. The interior is based largely on the Aventador's interior, but now incorporates the \\"carbon skin\\" element introduced on the Aventador J. The 7-speed ISR automated manual transmission is also retained from the Aventador and includes a new \\"track\\" setting for improved performance on a race track.  Design  The rear wheel arches are inspired by the Lamborghini Countach and the turbine wheels help to cool the brakes The design of the Veneno is a large departure from the previous styling of Lamborghini models. The design is inspired by Sports prototypes and racing cars. The Y-shaped design elements are a carryover from the Aventador's design language while the rear wheel arches hark back to the Countach. The vented engine cover improves cooling to the engine, while the extreme aerodynamic elements present on the car signify its track-focused characteristics.  Performance  The Lamborghini Veneno has a top speed of and has a acceleration time of 2.9 seconds. The car has a braking distance of from , and can produce 1.41 G while cornering.  Veneno Roadster  The roadster variant of the Lamborghini Veneno was unveiled on the Italian naval aircraft carrier Cavour docked in Abu Dhabi's Mina Zayed port in 2014, followed by the 2014 Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show. Performance of the roadster remains identical to that of the coup√© with the roadster being heavier than the coup√© counterpart due to chassis reinforcing components. The roadster went on sale for (excluding tax).  Production  Lamborghini built just five examples of the Veneno Coup√©: one for factory testing (dubbed car number zero), one retained for the factory, and three cars for customers, all of which were customised to customer specifications. In addition to the coup√©, only nine units of the roadster were produced.

Considered \\"one of the most controversial characters in the police chronicle\\",\\"Cabo Bruno must go to semiaberto\\", Alexandre Petillo, Jornal da Tarde, 08/15/2009, p. 8A he initially admitted these deaths but later denied them in his testimony.  Biography  Florisvaldo de Oliveira was born in Uchoa. The nickname \\"Cabo Bruno\\" came from his childhood in Catanduva, a provocation from his friends comparing him to a local alcoholic called Bruno. Even his mother began to call him just like that. Cabo Bruno was known as a vigilante, a person that kills for self perceived justice, usually in the outskirts. It was said that he killed \\"for hating the fringes\\", although testimonials suggested that some executions were motivated by the victims' appearance.\\"From Opal, PM terrified the southern zone in the 80s\\", Jornal da Tarde, 15/8/2009, p. 8A He acted almost always in his spare time,Caco Barcellos, Route 66, Editora Record, 2003, p. 133 in the district of Jabaquara, and some residents said that \\"in his time there was so much insecurity.\\" Traders were allegedly his biggest \\"customers\\", but he denied that. Jos√© Aparecido Benedito was the only survivor of Cabo Bruno's murders: after being shot, he pretended to be dead and managed to escape. Reports from journalist Caco Barcellos made him notorious, as it was he who covered the criminal's last imprisonment for the Jornal Nacional. Most of the shootings that he was charged with took place in 1982, and many bodies riddled with bullets found in the region during that year caused panic. The cars he used‚Äîa Chevrolet Chevette, Ford Maverick and a Chevrolet Impala‚Äîwhose colors were always changed, also elevated his fame. He was arrested for the first time on September 22, 1983 by court order, after being accused of more than twenty murders (being recognized by several witnesses), although he confessed to only one: on February 6, 1982, in the slum of Jardim Selma, where he was denounced by a friend of the victim, who survived.\\"The PM reports crimes committed by some of his men,\\" Jornal da Tarde, 24/9/1983 Many years later he would admit to about twenty murders, and according to his second wife: \\"The other [victims] put it on my account. There were people who killed and presented themselves as Cabo Bruno.\\" According to her, he assumed, \\"it would not make much difference.\\" At that time, S√£o Paulo Military Police estimated that Cabo Bruno and at least twelve police officers, including two high officials (a captain and a lieutenant), would be responsible for several executions in the city's South Zone.\\"Police: the new decisions of Reale Junior\\", Jornal da Tarde, 26/9/1983, p. 7 Police further reported that many of the executions would have been made based solely on the victim's appearance, including a boy killed because of a small cross tattooed on his wrist‚Äîto Cabo Bruno, any tattoo would indicate a criminal, according to his religious reasoning. By the time the investigations began, the gang was apparently protected by the higher ranks, but the advance gathering of evidence and clues led to the whole corporation's collapse. After 12 trials‚Äîin one of them, several other police officers went to court to press, but the evidence was aplenty‚ÄîCabo Bruno was sentenced to 113 years in prison.\\"Cabo Bruno will go to the semi-open regime\\", Jornal da Tarde, 21/8/2009, p. 5A After fleeing three times, the last time on May 30, 1991, he was detained at the Jos√© Augusto C√©sar Salgado Penitentiary in Trememb√©. He claimed to have become an evangelical and said he preferred not to be called Bruno. In 1998, an exhibition of oils on acrylic painted by him was held in S√£o Paulo. In July 2008, as a pastor in the ecumenical chapel of the prison, he married there to a housewife who did volunteer work.\\"Cabo Bruno House in Prison\\", Jornal da Tarde, 7/19/2008, p. 6A In his work as a pastor, Lindemberg Alves became one of his followers.  Liberation and death  In 2009, after completing one sixth of his sentence, he requested the conversion to a semi-open regime. The State Public Ministry requested a criminological psychosocial examination, done in two stages and with favorable opinions to the progression of the sentence, which was granted on August 19. Despite the semi-open regime, that year he was denied the benefit of temporary leave, which he could only have as of 2017, because of his history of escaping.\\"Cabo Bruno has temporary exit denied\\", Jornal da Tarde, 9/10/2009, p. 9A However, on August 22, 2012, the Taubat√© court granted him his freedom after 27 years' imprisonment. In addition to the opinion of the prosecutor, which was based on a law providing for the definitive release of prisoners with good behavior and imprisonment for more than twenty years, documents with praise from officials and from P2's own management regarding his conduct in prison, unitarily strengthened the decision. He plasticized the original release license and always carried a copy with him, along with a list of ten dreams that he would like to accomplish before he died. \\"In my escape, they [the police] would always stop me,\\" he complained, jokingly. \\"Now that I have the license, no one will stop me.\\" Just over a month after leaving prison, Cabo Bruno was killed with eighteen or twenty shots in the neighborhood Quadra Coberta, in Pindamonhangaba, around 11:30 pm on September 26, 2012.Cabo Bruno is murderd in the interior of SP (September 27, 2012) News Band. He was returning from a religious service in the municipality of Aparecida accompanied by relatives, when he was gunned down by two men; his relatives were unharmed. \\"According to witnesses, it was two men who arrived on foot and only shot at him,\\" explained the lieutenant of the 2nd Company of the 5th Battalion of the Military Police. \\"It was probably an execution, but it will now be up to the Civil Police to investigate.\\" As he was declared dead at the scene, Bruno was not taken to a hospital; crime scene experts collected shell casings from a .40 Smith & Wesson and another weapon, a .38 automatic Colt pistol. After Cabo Bruno's death, his family auctioned off a number of paintings by the ex-PM in order to restart life elsewhere.

Founded in 1985 as a single family-run store, it expanded to several storefront locations across Maryland and Pennsylvania, with food trucks, wholesale delivery, and a nationwide shipping service. It is the largest seller of Maryland Blue Crabs and crab cakes in the United States, selling over 150,000 crab cakes, 500,000 pounds of shrimp, and 75,000 bushels of live blue crabs annually. The company has served over one million customers, grosses $20 million, and its seafood was listed at the top of the Forbes list of \\"Best Food Gifts of 2017\\". History Cameron's was founded in 1985 by Allen Manesh, an Iranian American who had immigrated to the United States from Iran in 1975. His initial core business was buying and selling real estate with his company Ideal Realty Group. Soon he wanted to diversify into food-selling to provide an additional revenue stream, so on a parcel of land which he had purchased in Rockville, he first tried to start a fruit stand business with his brother Bijan. After doing more research, and getting some advice from a sea captain, he changed the business to a seafood market, naming it after his first-born son Cameron. The business expanded over the years to other restaurant locations, several food trucks, and also wholesale delivery. As of 2017, it had approximately one dozen locations in the Maryland/Pennsylvania area, including four food trucks. The company contracts directly with crabbers and distributors. Crabs are usually caught in the Chesapeake Bay region of Maryland, then shipped each morning to the Rockville location where they are sorted and cooked, primarily by steaming. The company has an official \\"True Blue Maryland Crab Meat\\" ranking from the Maryland Department of Agriculture. In Maryland's off-season (December through March), the crabs served are either from those flash-frozen earlier in the season, or shipped in from North Carolina, Florida, Texas, or Louisiana. The highest-grossing location for the company is in Capital Heights, which has sales of $3.5 million annually. Sitting across from the football stadium FedExField, the store's business increases by 50% when the Washington Redskins play, as it is routine for the fans to buy a bushel of crabs to take with them into the game. =Online store= In June 2017 the founders' sons - the cousins Cameron (aged 37) and Peymon (aged 28) - launched a side business to sell the seafood via e-commerce, with the goal being to take online orders and ship to addresses across the United States. Products include seafood both raw and prepared, along with ingredients and recipes. Cameron, also president of the family's real estate business, is a graduate of University of Maryland, with a degree in business management and finance. Online sales for the company are projected at $2.1 million in 2018. The internet business has eight fulltime employees, contracts with over a dozen teams of fishermen, and operates its own food-preparation facility. Shipments go out to all 50 states, and are especially popular among displaced Marylanders, athletes, and others transitioning to high-protein diets. Former NBA basketball star Gilbert Arenas regularly orders per month of crab meat from Cameron's, and in 2017 the company was listed on the Forbes magazine's list of \\"Best Food Gifts\\".

Through its status as a transportation and architectural icon, the terminal has also been depicted in many works of art. Grand Central features permanent works of art, including the celestial ceiling in the Main Concourse, the Glory of Commerce work and the statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt in front of the building's south facade, and the two cast-iron eagle statues adorning the terminal's facades. As well, Vanderbilt Hall is regularly used for temporary art exhibitions and events. The Dining Concourse has a series of lightboxes also used to display temporary art exhibits. The terminal is also known for its performance and installation art, including flash mobs and other spontaneous events. Artwork on display or part of the terminal=Facade=Glory of Commerce Glory of Commerce, a sculptural group by Jules-F√©lix Coutan The Glory of Commerce sculptural group rests atop the terminal's facade, directly above a broken pediment featuring a large clock. The work is also known as Progress with Mental and Physical Force or Transportation. It is about tall, wide, and weighs about . At its unveiling in 1914, the work was considered the largest sculptural group in the world. The work includes representations of Minerva, Hercules, and Mercury. The sculptures were designed by French sculptor Jules- F√©lix Coutan and carved by the John Donnelly Company. Coutan created the model in his Paris studio and shipped it to New York City later. Mercury is standing at the top center of the work, depicted traditionally with a caduceus and wearing a winged helmet, with loose drapery concealing otherwise complete nudity. He is standing in a contrapposto pose in front of an eagle, wings outstretched, peering around his right leg. Two other gods are depicted to Mercury's left and right: the male figure to his right is typically and officially deemed to be Hercules, though he lacks the god's characteristic club and lionskin. Instead, the god is depicted among an anchor, cogwheel, anvil and hammer, a beehive, grapes, wheat ears and a sickle. Many of these are symbols of Vulcan, who is depicted with Minerva and Mercury in other works. He is also nearly naked, staring at Mercury above him. The female figure, Minerva, is resting her head on her left arm, looking down at a roll of parchment on her lap. She is depicted among a globe, a measuring compass, volumes of books and thick wreaths of laurel. The work is seen as attempting to fulfill several goals: portraying the terminal itself as a new technology, representing the Vanderbilt family, and serving as an artistic piece to parallel European art and architecture of the time. Tiffany clock There is a clock on top of the south facade. It contains the world's largest example of Tiffany glass. The clock was designed by the Self Winding Clock Company, along with several other clocks in the terminal. The digit \\"VI\\", on the bottom of the clock, hides a flap that is used for maintenance. Statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt A statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt, longtime owner of the New York Central, stands at the center of the terminal's south facade, directly below the Tiffany clock and facing the Park Avenue Viaduct. The work was sculpted by Ernst Plassmann, and is of bronze, tall and weighing 4 tons, with a 9-foot-tall granite pedestal. It depicts Vanderbilt bareheaded and in his commonly-seen winter clothes, including a heavy double-breasted and fur- trimmed overcoat. He is posed in a noble way, described as Jeffersonian, with one hand on his chest and another outstretched. It was the largest bronze statue cast in the United States at the time. The statue was created as part of a bronze bas-relief on the facade of the Hudson River Railroad depot at St. John's Park in the present-day neighborhood of Tribeca. The bas-relief was long and depicted various components of Vanderbilt's life, including his steamships and trains. The relief and statue were generally designed by Albert De Groot, a steamship captain under Vanderbilt, though they were sculpted by Plassmann. Unveiled and dedicated in November 1869, the works received much criticism from newspapers and other writers; the New York Times said such a tribute ought to include \\"the dismembered bodies of men, women and children\\" killed in the New York Central's open railyards to the north. This criticism may have convinced Vanderbilt to abandon his plans for another statue of himself, to have been installed at Grand Central Depot, which was built in 1871. The planned statue was to have been part of a grouping designed by De Groot with a sailor at one side and Native American at the other. In 1929, Plassmann's statue was moved to Grand Central Terminal. Once again, it received criticism in the press. Eagles Grand Central Terminal has two cast-iron eagle statues on display. The eagles weigh about each, and have a wingspan of about . They are two of the 11 or 12 eagle statues that ornamented the terminal's predecessor, Grand Central Station. In 1910, when the station was demolished to build Grand Central Terminal, the eagles were dispersed throughout the city and New York state. The two eagles that sit atop the terminal were donated to the MTA around the turn of the 21st century. One had stood for years in a backyard in Bronxville, New York; in 1999, it was placed atop the Lexington Avenue entrance to Grand Central Market. The other was at a monastery in Garrison, New York (the present-day Garrison Institute), and was installed in 2004 at the terminal's southwest entrance by Vanderbilt Avenue and 42nd Street. Eight identical eagle statues are elsewhere, including one at a private home in Kings Point, New York; one at the Space Farms Zoo and Museum in Beemerville, New Jersey; two at the Vanderbilt Museum in Long Island; one, known as the \\"Shandaken Eagle\\", in Phoenicia, New York; two at Saint Basil Academy in Garrison; and one at the Philipse Manor station in Sleepy Hollow, New York. One or two of Grand Central Station's eagles remain lost. The former Penn Station was also adorned with 22 eagle statues, many of which were dispersed across the United States after the building's demolition. =Interior=Ceiling Redstone missile, 1957 The Main Concourse's ceiling is an elliptical barrel vault. A false ceiling of square boards, installed in 1944, bears an elaborate celestial mural painted with more than 2,500 stars and several bands in gold set against a turquoise backdrop. Original plans called for the ceiling to contain a skylight, but this was not practical. Instead, a mural was painted directly on the ceiling. It was conceived in 1912 by architect Warren and painter Paul C√©sar Helleu. The latter, who had come to the United States for a three-month stay to create portraits of eight women for a Parisian magazine, sketched a conceptual design for Warren. Helleu worked from a chart given by Columbia astronomy professor Harold Jacoby, who had derived it from the Uranometria, a star atlas published in 1603. The mural was executed in 1913 by James Monroe Hewlett and Charles Basing of Hewlett-Basing Studio, They were assisted in the design by Helleu and multiple astronomers, and in the painting by more than 50 painting assistants. Around 63 electric bulbs were installed to amplify the visual impact of the stars. The depicted constellations include those of the winter zodiac viewable from October to March, from Aquarius to Cancer. Also depicted are Pegasus, Triangulum, Musca, and Orion, as well as two broad gold bands spanning the ceiling, representing the ecliptic and the equator. By the 1920s, the roof began to leak, damaging the mural with water and mold. Over the next two decades, the mural \\"faded to a hue something like that of a khaki shirt overdosed with Navy blue‚Äù. In August 1944, New York Central covered the original ceiling with 4-by-8-foot cement-and-asbestos boards and painted them in a facsimile of the original mural. Unveiled in June 1945, the new mural contained less astronomical detail; it also lacked light bulbs to mimic stars. The boards' outlines remain visible today. Constellation of Cancer pointing toward the uncleaned ceiling patch By the 1980s, the new ceiling was obscured by decades of what was thought to be coal and diesel smoke. Spectroscopic examination revealed that it was mostly tar and nicotine from tobacco smoke. As a general renovation of the terminal got underway, historians and preservationists called for the 1944 boards to be removed and the original ceiling mural restored. But Beyer Blinder Belle, the architecture firm that led the renovation, deemed the original mural irreversibly damaged and noted that the asbestos-laden boards would be hazadous to remove. So, starting in September 1996, the ceiling boards were cleaned and repainted. Lights were installed into the ceiling boards to imitate the stars, restoring a feature previously only seen from 1913 to 1944. A single dark patch above the former Michael Jordan Steakhouse and next to the crab constellation (representing Cancer) was left untouched by renovators to remind visitors of the grime that once covered the ceiling. The ceiling bears a small dark circle amid the stars above the image of Pisces. In a 1957 attempt to improve public morale after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, an American Redstone missile was set up in the Main Concourse. With no other way to erect the missile, a hole was cut into the 1944 false ceiling to allow a cable to be lowered to lift the rocket into place. Historical preservation dictated that this hole remain as a reminder of the many uses of the Terminal over the years. The starry ceiling contains several astronomical inaccuracies. While the stars within some constellations appear correctly as they would from earth, other constellations are reversed left-to-right, as is the overall arrangement of the constellations on the ceiling. For example, Orion is correctly rendered, but the adjacent constellations Taurus and Gemini are reversed both internally and in their relation to Orion, with Taurus near Orion's raised arm where Gemini should be. There are various explanations that are often given for this error. One possible explanation is that the overall ceiling design might have been based on the medieval custom of depicting the sky as it would appear to God looking in at the celestial sphere from outside, but that would have reversed Orion as well. A more likely explanation is partially mistaken transcription of the sketch supplied by Harold Jacoby. Though the astronomical inconsistencies were noticed promptly by a commuter in 1913, they have not been corrected in any of the subsequent renovations of the ceiling. Graybar Passage mural Trumbull's mural The Graybar Passage extends from the northeast corner of the Main Concourse, underneath the Graybar Building, directly east to Lexington Avenue. The ceiling is composed of seven groin vaults, each of which has an ornamental bronze chandelier. One of the vaults features a mural depicting American transportation. The work was painted in 1927 by muralist Edward Trumbull. The first two vaults viewed from leaving Grand Central featured cumulus clouds, while the third remains, featuring technologies that had significantly affected the world. These include a train pulled by an electric locomotive, a bridge resembling the original design of the city's High Bridge, the construction of a skyscraper, the manufacturing of steel, and several airplanes (including the Spirit of St. Louis) along with a searchlight and radio tower. The mural has a caramel color; the once-bright colors present have faded over time. Sirshasana Sirshasana, an aluminum and polyester resin sculpture with crystals, was created by Donald Lipski in 1998. The sculpture hangs from the ceiling of Grand Central Market just inside its 43rd Street entrance. The chandelier has the shape of an olive tree, with branches spanning 25 feet and featuring 5,000 crystal pendants. The base of the tree is finished in gold and crystals, in place of olives. The sculpture is named after a headstand posture in yoga: the inverted tree. The work alludes to Grand Central's decorative chandeliers, and is a \\"comment on the allure of the exotic and tempting wares sold in the marketplace\\". As Above, So Below As Above, So Below, a work of glass, bronze, and mosaic in several Grand Central North passageways, was made by Brooklyn-based artist Ellen Driscoll in 1998. The mosaic's five scenes, each stemming from a different continent, depict myths and legends about the heavens that reflect life on earth. The work reminds passengers of humanity's spiritual and worldly past. Like the terminal's astronomical ceiling, it symbolizes our connection to the wider world and heavens. File:GCTaasb1.jpg\\"As Above, So Below\\" Sisyphus mosaic File:GCTaasb2.jpg\\"As Above, So Below\\" Persephone mosaic File:GCTaasb3.jpg\\"As Above, So Below\\" Einstein mosaic A Field of Wild Flowers A Field of Wild Flowers, a mural on the walls of the Station Master's Office, was made by Roberto Juarez in 1997. The work uses many materials to give texture, strength, and beauty. Layers include gesso, under-painting, urethane, and varnish, along with rice paper and a dusting of peat moss. It depicts a bountiful garden landscape as viewed though windows of a slow-moving train. It repeats some of Grand Central's architectural details, including fruit, acorns, and garlands. Other Mural echoing the Main Concourse ceiling One of the retail areas of the Graybar Passage, currently the alcohol vendor Central Cellars, was the Grand Central Theatre or Terminal Newsreel Theatre. The movie theater lobby had walls covered with large world maps and an astronomical mural painted by Tony Sarg. The theater opened in 1937 and operated for about 30 years before being gutted for retail space. A renovation in the early 2000s removed a false ceiling, revealing the theater's astronomical mural (similar in colors and style to the Main Concourse ceiling) and projection window. The Dining Concourse has 16 lightboxes that form a quadriptych. MTA Arts & Design maintains a rotating art exhibition in the space. The first non-photographic exhibit in the space was On Paper/ Grand Central at 100, which was created for the terminal's centennial and was displayed from September 2013 to September 2014.

Exhibitions and performances Performance art from Heard NY, 2013 =Special exhibitions= Grand Central Terminal has held a number of special exhibits, including: * In June 1948, a fashion show by Filene's and the New Haven Railroad was hosted on the balcony of the Main Concourse, and a thousand square feet of sand was imported for the event. The show also used space at Track 61, in a storage yard north of Grand Central. * In 1993, a portion of Ruckus Manhattan, an exhibit by Red Grooms, was displayed in the Vanderbilt Hall. * In 1995, Lost: New York Projects by Christian Boltanski involved a display, titled Lost Property, of about 5,000 personal belongings from the terminal's lost-and- found, on display on metal shelves in the Biltmore Room. * In 1997, Chrysanne Stathacos created the Wish Machine, an interactive installation where passers- by could buy a scent from a vending-machine-style installation which would in turn aid them in manifesting a desire. The work was commissioned by Creative Time as part of their Day With(out) Art initiative. * In 2004, Rudolf Stingel debuted his first work of public art at Grand Central, in Vanderbilt Hall, titled \\"Plan B\\". * In 2009, the hall hosted four of the BMW Art Cars, cars which were painted by Andy Warhol, Frank Stella, Roy Lichtenstein, and Robert Rauschenberg. =Events= The Main Concourse and Vanderbilt Hall frequently host special exhibits and events. These include: * Every year, the terminal has had concerts with Christmas carols and organ recitals. In the 1930s, a woman named Mary Lee Read would often give organ concerts from one of the terminal's balconies. * In 1935, the Works Progress Administration-backed Manhattan Concert Band performed * In 1943, an Easter performance was given by the Princeton Theological Seminary choir. * In 1987, the performing arts organization Dancing in the Streets presented Grand Central Dances. The production involved the dance companies of Merce Cunningham, Lucinda Childs, Paul Thompson and Stephan Koplowitz, as well as the high-wire artist Philippe Petit and juggler Michael Moschen. The event included \\"Terminal Triptych\\", an hour-long dance in the Biltmore Room, \\"Fenestrations\\", a 13-minute dance on four levels of the Main Concourse's window catwalks, and a tight-rope walk across the concourse by Petit. * In 1988, a Double Dutch jump-roping competition was held in the Main Concourse as part of a city-sponsored \\"Summer Games\\". * In 2011, a flash mob show by Moncler Grenoble took place in the Main Concourse. * In 2013, Nick Cave and dancers from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater organized the performance Heard NY. The performance took place in Vanderbilt Hall, the Main Concourse, and on the catwalks between the terminal's arched windows. The MTA had approached Cave for this project for the terminal's centennial, and the performance piece ran for one week. =Musical performances= Music Under New York audition, 2014 The terminal hosts numerous performances. It is also a host site for Music Under New York, where musicians can perform within various transit hubs controlled by the MTA. In Grand Central, artists can perform in the Graybar Passage as well as in the Dining Concourse, opposite Tracks 105 and 106. Auditions for the program take place each spring in the terminal's Vanderbilt Hall. Beginning during the Christmas season of 1928 and continuing on certain holidays until 1958, an organist performed in Grand Central's North Gallery. The organist was Mary Lee Read, who initially performed on a borrowed Hammond organ. Grand Central management eventually bought an organ and a set of chimes for the station and began paying Read an annual retainer. In addition to the weeks before Christmas, Read played during the weeks before Thanksgiving and Easter and on Mother's Day. On one Easter, a choir composed of Works Progress Administration employees performed with her. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, she attempted to lift spirits by playing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", which brought the main concourse to a standstill. The stationmaster subsequently asked her to avoid selections that would cause passengers to miss their trains, and Read became known as the only organist in New York who was forbidden to play the United States' national anthem. In 2018, Paul McCartney gave a private concert in the terminal on the premiere date of his new album Egypt Station, with guests including Jon Bon Jovi, Meryl Streep, Amy Schumer, Kate Moss and Steve Buscemi. In February 2020, South Korean pop group BTS staged a live performance of their song, \\"ON\\", at the Main Concourse.  Art featuring Grand Central  Rays of light in Grand Central, c. 1950 Grand Central is one of the most-photographed places in New York City and the United States. One of the most famous photographs of the terminal shows light streaming from Main Concourse windows down to the floor. The work is reproduced online through hundreds of different images, with variations in angles, cropping, flipping, filters, and watermarks, as well as the author and date attributed to the works. Photographer Penelope Umbrico collected a sample of such images in Four Photographs of Rays of Sunlight in Grand Central, on display in the terminal's Dining Concourse.

Wonderly (April 21, 1922 ‚Äì December 3, 2004) was an American biologist and old-earth creationist who taught at Grace College, where he helped to establish the biology department. Biography Wonderly was born on April 21, 1922 in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland, to Earl and Gustava Wonderly. After graduating from Oakland High School in Oakland, Maryland in 1940, he attended the Southeastern Bible College for two years. He was then drafted into the United States Army, in which capacity he served in both Japan and Europe during World War II. After the war, he returned to the United States to attend Wheaton College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in anthropology in 1949. He then enrolled at Central Baptist Seminary in Kansas City, Kansas, from which he received a Bachelor of Divinity degree and a Master of Theology degree in 1952 and 1955, respectively. In 1961, he earned a Master of Science degree in zoology from Ohio University; he began teaching at Wingate College the same year. He joined the faculty of Grace College in 1966 and continued to teach there until 1973. From 1974 to 1977, he wrote the book God's Time-Records in Ancient Sediments with the aim of educating his fellow Christians about the geology of sedimentary rocks. He followed this with a second book, Neglect of Geologic Data: Sedimentary Strata Compared with Young- Earth Creationist Writings, which was published in 1987. He died on December 3, 2004 at Garrett County Memorial Hospital in Oakland. Views on creationism Despite being a theologically conservative Baptist, Wonderly accepted the scientific evidence that the Earth was much older than young- earth creationists believe it to be. In explaining his views on evolution and the age of the Earth, he wrote, \\"Christians need to reject evolutionism, but when they reject true scientific discoveries they bring disgrace upon the Bible and Christianity.\\" He supported reconciling the old age of the Earth with the teachings of the Bible by means of day-age creationism. When administrators at Grace College learned about Wonderly's unfavorable views of young-earth creationism and flood geology, they agreed to hire him only on the condition that he not interfere with the College's commitment to advancing young-earth creationism. Wonderly agreed, but after some of his students found out about his views, the College's president banned Wonderly from further discussing his views at all, prompting Wonderly to resign. Prominent young- earth creationist Henry Morris defended Grace's handling of Wonderly's anti- creationist views, arguing that these views were already receiving a fair hearing throughout society.

Goodman received public notice in the early 1960s for his oil paintings, leading to his inclusion in the 1973 Whitney Biennial. In 1996, the Philadelphia Museum of Art presented a retrospective show of Goodman's paintings and drawings. Biography Sidney Goodman was born in South Philadelphia in 1936, the son of Russian Jewish immigrant parents who came to America in the 1920s. His father was a furrier and his mother was an actress in the Yiddish theatre. In 1954, Goodman enrolled in the Philadelphia College of Art, (now University of the Arts) graduating in 1958. Goodman entered the Army, serving from 1958-59. In 1961, his debut exhibition in New York City at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery received high praise. At the age of 27, Time magazine described Goodman as \\"one of the most respected and sought-after of the new figure painters.\\" He received critical attention for his New York debut exhibition and was awarded the Whitney Museum of American Art Neysa McMein Purchase Award. He began teaching at the Philadelphia College of Art starting in 1960. He would teach there until the spring of 1978, when he joined the faculty of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Goodman taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts until 2011, when he retired. Goodman received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1964. He was selected to be part of the 1973 Whitney Biennial. The Museum of Art at the Pennsylvania State University organized a major show that traveled in 1980-81. From 1978 to 2011, Goodman taught at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Goodman had nineteen one-person shows at the Terry Dintenfass Gallery between 1961 and 1996. In 1996, the Philadelphia Museum of Art presented a retrospective of Goodman's paintings and drawings. From 1960 to 1978, he was married to the artist Eileen Goodman, with whom he had one child, Amanda, in 1965. In 1980 Goodman married the artist and lifelong model/muse, Pamela McCabe. They had two children, Luke in 1986 and Maia in 1989. In 1986, Goodman received the Hazlette Memorial Award for Excellence in the Arts (Painting). In 2006, he received an honorary doctorate from Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts. Artistic practice Goodman, using oil paint, pastel, charcoal, pencil, pen and ink, forged a style through direct observation, creative imagination, and prolonged study of European and American masters, employing a figurative and allegorical approach lodged in modern urban and suburban subject matter. He often renders his subjects with moody or ominous lighting. Goodman said of light: > Light has its own power and mystery. Things that I am attracted to come by > light - the way things are formed by the use of light. Goodman's work is noted as exemplary of a renewal of figurative realism in 1960s. In the New York Times, Brian O'Doherty reviews his show, describing his imagery as \\"a modern apocalypse influenced by Freud and Gray's Anatomy.\\" Critics noted Goodman's examination of \\"expressive distortions of the human form, and connected him to the work of postwar figurative artists such as Francis Bacon. Art historian and curator Anne d'Harnoncourt describes Goodman's work as encompassing \\"both his fascination with capturing the characteristic shapes, features, and gestures of humanity (whether drawn from his family and friends or from newspaper snapshots) and his drive to incorporate them into disturbing compositions that convey complex, even contradictory meanings.\\" From 1963 on, Goodman used a polaroid camera as a visual sketchbook, his studio full of photos he took and other references that inspired him. From the mid 1960s until the late 1970s he was particularly concerned with what he calls \\"the violated landscape'‚Äîinanimate structures (water tanks, gas tanks, dumpsters, stadiums, incinerators, out of scale buildings) that threaten the harmony of nature.\\" Goodman noted: \\"I sometimes paint a realistic picture in order to justify logically something unreal.\\" Goodman featured his family and himself as the primary subject of his many portraits. He found inspiration in the work of Goya and Velasquez. In 1996, he said that shows and reviews always were secondary to what was happening daily in his studio. > If the painting is going well, that's the main thing. If it's not going > well, then all the other stuff isn't going to help. I felt that way back in > the '60s, and I feel that way today.

It has a commensal relationship with a hermit crab and occurs on the lower shore of coasts on the western side of the Atlantic Ocean. Ecology Dipolydora commensalis is a burrowing worm that invariably bores into a gastropod mollusc shell that is being used by a hermit crab. The burrow usually starts at the columella at the side of the shell's aperture and a thin calcareous tube is secreted extending internally to the apex of the shell. The worm lives in this tube with its anterior end projecting. A pair of palps on the prostomium (first segment) catch food particles floating past. The worm uses both cilia and muscles to move the particles down a ciliary groove to its mouth. The worm is able to reject inedible material at the mouth and may be able to reject such material as it traverses the palps. The palps are able to regrow if they are damaged by movements of the hermit crab, and both the anterior and posterior parts of the worm are able to regenerate if it gets severed. In the laboratory, worms can live for four years, rather longer than most empty gastropod shells. This worm has been found to have a commensal relationship with nine different species of hermit crab. The worm is likely to gain advantage from the crab's mobility and the protection from predators that the crab's presence affords, as well as the avoidance of being overwhelmed by silt. Periodically a hermit crab will leave its shell in order to move into a larger one. During this period of vacancy, the worm is able to use nutrient granules stored in the wall of the gut. There is usually competition among hermit crabs for vacant shells, so the empty shell is likely soon to be reoccupied. It is likely that the hermit crab recognises the worm associated with it and does not attack it, but this aspect has not been studied in this species; however, in the case of some other commensal polychaete worms, such as Neanthes fucata, it has been demonstrated.

Early life and education  Rosalba Rol√≥n was born in 1951, in Comer√≠o, Puerto Rico, a small town neighboring San Juan. From a young age, she was exposed to arts through her parents, who took her to theater productions, as well as her aunt, who wrote poetry and taught literature. She also attended ballet, Spanish dance classes, and accordion lessons. Through a government initiative, Arte en la Communidad, she became involved in the arts at school. In middle school, Rol√≥n's family moved to San Juan, and by 9th grade she was active in theater and dance classes. During high school, she won the award for best actress along with a scholarship toward her first year of college. She majored in psychology, and completed both her bachelor's and master's degrees in the field. In 1973, Rol√≥n moved to New York with her first husband. She worked as a social worker and took theater classes to fill the gaps in her formal education. Where the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center stands today was then a group of artists' studios. Rol√≥n attended workshops there, beginning in 1977. Her teacher at the studio recommended she attend workshops at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. She studied there for a year and a half under Nat Horne. She devoted increasingly more time to theater, taking classes and auditioning, and found a part-time job with the Association of Hispanic Arts (AHA). By age 27, she was divorced and had committed to doing theater full-time.  Career  In her mid 20s, Rol√≥n landed a number of roles with Latino theaters in New York, including Porton and Thalia, and was doing voiceovers on the side. By 1978, she was still working part-time with the AHA and had additionally found a job as an adjunct professor at Lehman College. However, creatively, she began looking to branch out and start something on her own. She was immersed in political discourse and aware of the tradition of Teatro Popular, or street theater, and Teatro Campesino, and so began to think about making theater in those traditions. In collaboration with a friend, she began a project to take stock of 100 years of Puerto Rican theater, from 1878 to 1978. After researching and reading numerous plays, they narrowed it down to nine plays, spanning different decades. After rehearsing in friends' offices, they had their first reading in a friend's bedroom for an audience of 10 people. This was the beginning of the Pregones Theater Company. Since then, Pregones has produced more than 80 pieces, 37 of which Rol√≥n has worked on. = Pregones Theater Company = Pregones Theater Company is a Bronx-based touring company that focuses on expanding arts opportunities to Latinx theater artists.  History  After their first small performance, Rol√≥n invested in starting their own theater company. She, along with Luis Mel√©ndez and David Crommett, began to work seriously to produce the play collection, or La Colleci√≥n, that they had created. They rehearsed wherever they could find space and performed all over New York and the surrounding states, including small towns and prisons. According to Rol√≥n, they were in Philadelphia so much they received an award reserved for local artists. The initial impetus behind the Pregones Theater Company was to create collective productions and bring them to people outside the mainstream theater community. To this end, they chose productions for their repertoire that would require minimal staging. As the company grew to include more actors and musicians, they decided they needed a more formal rehearsal space. By that time, they had been working with a number of Bronx organizations for more than a year, and when given the opportunity to use an office space there they jumped at the chance to settle down. By 1985, the company was rehearsing in their office rooms and performing in St. Ann's church in a room they had renovated from a gym into a theater space. While there they produced many works, including Areyto de Pescadores (1982), High Noon/Al Mediod√≠a (1983), Migrants!: Cantata a los emigrantes (1985), The Caravan (1986), and Voices of Steel (1990). During the 1990s, the company grew and began many outreach programs, including the Visiting Artists Series, the Pregones Summer Stage, and curriculum development sessions, as well as collaborations with other theaters throughout NYC and around the world. As the company grew, so too did their need for a larger space. In the late 1990s, they relocated to The Studio and in 2005, they found their permanent home in a warehouse they renovated with the help of a $2.7 million capital campaign.  Structure  The company has been a collective project since its inception. There are three directors, including Rol√≥n, a music director, and a collective of actors. Some pieces are more director-driven than others, but all include cooperative elements, and most are musical, necessitating that the music director be a co-director.  Accomplishments  Pregones Theater Company has performed in over 400 cities in 13 different countries, although their main focus is the Tri-State area, and they have nearly 70 premiers to their credit. The company has partnerships with many different theater companies, including the Roadside Theater in Kentucky, The Yuyachkani Collective in Peru, and the Worldwide Virtual Theater Carrousel cohort in Peru, Belgium, South Africa, and Slovakia, among others. They have received a number of different awards, including the leading national ensemble theater designation from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, the Primary Cultural Institution Designation from the New York State Council of the Arts, the New York State Governor's Arts Award, and the Culture and Humanities Award from the Center for Puerto Rican Studies.  Merger with the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre  In 2016, Pregones completed a merger with the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater (PRTT) in order to expand the reach of both of their programming. The theaters now function as one institution, although they retain their previous names. Since the early 2000s, the two theaters have done many collaborations and co-productions, and Rol√≥n worked extensively with the founder and director of PRTT, Miriam Col√≥n. = Projects and collaborations = * 21 Islands International Short Film Fest (Dec. 9-11, 2016) * Elders Share The Arts (ESTA) *New York Shakespeare's Festival Latino *Teatrofestival  Awards and recognition  * 2008 USA Fontanals Fellow * 2008 El Diario/La Prensa Outstanding Woman of the Year * 2010 Bronx Influential Women * 2011 APPLAUSE award, Bronx Council on the Arts * 2018 Doris Duke Artists Award * United States Artists (USA) board of directors  References  1951 births Living people People from Comer√≠o, Puerto Rico Puerto Rican actresses Puerto Rican stage actresses ","title":"Rosalba Rol√≥n"},{"id":"59096648","text":"Francis Boespflug (1 September 1948 ‚Äì 6 November 2018) was a French film producer.

This phrase serves to confirm that the discourse is coming from the Buddha himself, as a \\"seal of authenticity\\". Buddhist tradition maintains that the disciple ƒÄnanda used the formula for the first time, as a form of personal testimony, but this is disputed by some scholars. It is also disputed how the phrase relates to the words that follow, and several theories have been developed with regard to how the text was originally intended to be read. The formula has also been used in later MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna discourses.  History and function  upright According to Buddhist tradition‚Äîbased on the commentary to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya‚Äîthe formula was first used by the disciple ƒÄnanda during the First Buddhist Council held at RƒÅjag·πõha (present-day Rajgir). At this gathering, the Buddhist Canon was established, and ƒÄnanda was given the role of 'rapporteur' () of the Buddha's teachings, being the personal attendant of the Buddha. The formula is usually followed by the place where the discourse is given, as well as the names and numbers of those it is given to. In the Chinese exegetical tradition, the formula is known as the generic preface (), as opposed to the subsequent part that differs between discourses, introducing the specifics, known as the specific preface (). In some Early Buddhist Texts, other similar constructions are used, such as 'This was said by the Blessed One' () in the Itivuttaka.  Interpretation and translation  The formula is glossed by the 5th-century Indian commentator Buddhaghosa as \\"received in the Buddha's presence\\". Indologist Jean Filliozat (190682) disagreed with the traditional explanation that ƒÄnanda was the one who invented the formula, arguing that the formula is an odd way to describe a first-hand witness account, as it sounds as though what follows is hearsay. He argued instead that it was a later compiler who added it. However, comparing Buddhist with Jain texts, Sanskrit scholar John Brough (191784) concluded the formula indicates personal testimony as opposed to hearsay. Indologist Jean Przyluski (18851944) argued that the formula originally may also have meant that the Buddhist discourses were presented as part of sacred revelation (≈õruti). This was intended to prove that the Buddhist texts were on the same level with, or superior than, the Vedas in the Brahmanical tradition. Brough concurred with Przyluski that this may have played some role in the development of the phrase, but concluded that the motivation of declaring oneself a witness of the Buddha's teaching \\"could by itself quite adequately explain it\\". Brough relates a traditional account in which the Buddha's disciples weep when they hear ƒÄnanda say the words Thus have I heard for the first time, \\"marvelling that they should hear again the very words of their dead master\\". Indologist disagrees with Brough, however, citing two discourses from the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya and Majjhima NikƒÅya in which the formula refers to what \\"... was acquired through communication by others\\", as opposed to personal experience. Klaus also points at another expression which that a discourse has been directly received from someone, that is samukkhƒÅ me ta·πÉ ... samukkhƒÅ pa·π≠iggahita·πÉ, meaning 'I heard and learned this own lips': an expression often used with regard to the Buddha. He proposes that the formula Thus have I heard does mark a discourse as the Buddha's word, but not because the discourse has been heard from the Buddha's own lips by the speaker. He does admit that the early Sanskrit texts contain a later interpretation of the formula, which does refer to personal experience. Indologist √âtienne Lamotte (190383) argued it was the Buddha who had the formula placed at the beginning of the Buddhist discourses, conveying this through ƒÄnanda. In addition, the formula may have been used by editors to standardize the discourses, as it is even used in discourses given by ƒÄnanda himself.  Punctuation  There has been considerable debate as to how the first sentences of the preface of Buddhist discourses should be translated, especially with regard to punctuation. There are three main opinions. The first possible and most common translation is Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was at ... in ... Buddhist studies scholar Mark Allon has defended this translation based on metrical and rhyme patterns. The words of the PƒÅli formula indicate the oral tradition through which the discourses were passed down. As with many parts of the discourses, the preface consist of rhymes to help memorization of the text, such as repetition of initial consonant sounds (alliteration; eva·πÉ, eka·πÉ) and final sounds (homoioteleuton; eva·πÉ, sutta·πÉ, eka·πÉ and samaya·πÉ). These rhyme patterns show that the two phrases, the first phrase starting with 'thus' (eva·πÉ me sutta·πÉ) and the second phrase, eka·πÉ samaya·πÉ (PƒÅli; ), 'at one time', were seen as two separate units. On a similar note, the first phrase has a vedha type metrical pattern, which is repeated by the second phrase, eka·πÉ samaya·πÉ, 'at one time'. Buddhist studies scholars Fernando Tola and Carmen Dragonetti have also argued for this translation with a three-word pre-amble (the three words being eva·πÉ me sutta·πÉ), on the grounds that it gives the best meaning to the context. However, numerous scholars read the words 'at one time' (; ) as combined with the first phrase, making for a five-word preamble. In their opinion, the first lines should be translated to Thus have i heard at one time. The Blessed One was staying at ... in ... This translation is often attributed to Brough, but was first proposed by Orientalist Alexander von Sta√´l-Holstein (18771937). Von Sta√´l-Holstein preferred this translation, basing himself on Indian commentaries, and Brough based himself on Tibetan translations, common usage in AvadƒÅnas and Early Buddhist Texts, as well as PƒÅli and Sanskrit commentators. Indologist Oskar von Hin√ºber rejects Von Sta√´l-Holstein's and Brough's interpretation, however. He argues that although in Sanskrit it may be possible to connect the two phrases in one sentence, in PƒÅli this is highly unusual. Von Hin√ºber further states that in the early PƒÅli texts, as well as the PƒÅli commentaries, separating the two phrases is actually quite common. Konrad Klaus agrees with von Hin√ºber's arguments. Buddhist studies scholar Brian Galloway further states that many Tibetan and Indian commentators such as Vimalamitra (8th century) did not support a five-word but rather a three- word pre-amble, reading at one time with the text following it. Religious Studies scholar Mark Tatz disagrees with Galloway's interpretation, however, providing several reasons. In response, Galloway rejects most of Tatz' arguments. A third group of scholars believe that the details of the place should also be mentioned within the same sentence, with no punctuation: Thus have I heard at the one time when the Blessed one was staying at ... in ... This type of translation, called the \\"double-jointed construction\\", has been proposed by Religious Studies scholar Paul Harrison and Buddhologist . Harrison bases himself on Tibetan translations and discussion in Sanskrit commentaries.  Usage in Buddhist history  KumƒÅrajƒ´va in front of the Kizil Caves, Xinjiang, China alt=Statue of monk sitting with the right leg touching his left knee Prior to the 5th century, Chinese translations of Buddhist texts would often translate the standard formula as Heard like this (), leaving out the I for stylistic reasons. During the 5th century, translator KumƒÅrajƒ´va (344413 CE) started rendering the formula as Rushi wowen (), which became the standard Chinese translation, despite its unnatural construction. MahƒÅyƒÅna and VajrayƒÅna traditions considered many later discourses the Buddha's word, and also included the formula at the beginning of those. Indeed, the 5th-century Chinese commentary Dazhidulun recommends editors to do so. Often, MahƒÅyƒÅna commentaries state that the formula can not only refer to ƒÄnanda, but also to certain bodhisattvas, such as Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´. Modern scholarship has drawn into question the historical value of most of these introductions of MahƒÅyƒÅna discourses, though some scholars do not exclude the possibility that some of the content of the discourses themselves goes back to the Buddha.

In fact, the side would only lose four matches all season: home and away to both Hekari and second-placed Eastern Stars, who both dominated the division. However, six draws and just two wins, against Madang Fox and Gigira Laitepo, meant the side missed out on the playoff places by a single point. In July 2011, it was announced that the side were registered to play in the upcoming 2011‚Äì12 season. Once again, the side were one of seven teams, but this season saw a steep decline in form for the side.

He was a miller by trade, and built a mill near Vandalia, Michigan, at a site later known as O'Dell's Mill. A confrontation at O'Dell's Mill between area abolitionists and Kentucky slaveowners in 1847, which led to the Kentuckians going home without the fugitive slaves they were chasing, lent urgency to Southerners' demands that led to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. He was a township supervisor for six years, and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1835. He served in the first and third sessions of the Michigan House of Representatives.

Taxonomy Nasutixalus was erected in 2016 to accommodate Nasutixalus medogensis. The species was described based on a single specimen. Molecular data suggested that this specimen represented a distinct lineage with the family Rhacophoridae, warranting recognition as a new genus. In a study published only two days later, Sathyabhama Das Biju and colleagues erected a new monotypic genus Frankixalus for Polypedates jerdonii; the name of the genus honours from the Free University of Brussels. Because of the earlier publication date, priority is given to Nasutixalus, rendering Frankixalus synonymous. A specimen first identified as Theloderma moloch was genetically distinct from other Theloderma and made the genus paraphyletic. Later analysis showed that Theloderma moloch collected near its type locality indeed cluster with other Theloderma, whereas the anomalous specimen actually belongs to the same lineage as Nasutixalus jerdonii and is now described as Nasutixalus medogensis. Species There are three species: * Nasutixalus jerdonii (G√ºnther, 1876) * Nasutixalus medogensis Jiang, Wang, Yan, and Che, 2016 * Nasutixalus yingjiangensis Yang and Chan, 2018 Description Nasutixalus are cryptic, medium-sized frogs: adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. Fingers have rudimentary webbing whereas the toes are moderately webbed. Habitat and reproduction Tadpoles Nasutixalus jerdonii with ingested eggs Nasutixalus are arboreal and live in montane evergreen forests. Male Nasutixalus jerdonii and N. yingjiangensis call from tree holes. Eggs of N. jerdonii have been found in water-filled tree holes, adhering on the inner walls slightly above the water surface. Tadpoles were found in water and had eggs in their stomachs, i.e., they are oophagous. Oophagy is considered an adaptation in phytotelm-breeding frogs for a nutrient-deficient environment. Whether the observed eggs were conspecific is not known, although circumstantial evidence suggests so.

When he was three years old, the family moved to a farm near Springfield, Ohio, and Smith received a rudimentary education. At age 18, he left home and spent two years clearing timber in nearby counties. In 1829, having accumulated capital of $350 (), he built the first house in Northampton, Ohio, and opened a small store. He moved to Calvin Township, Michigan, in 1831, along with his father and brother John, and the three bought a sawmill; his father and brother soon returned to Ohio and Smith ran the mill for two years. He also ran a whiskey distillery for several years. He sold the mill in 1835 and bought of land in Jefferson Township, Michigan, and farmed it for eighteen years, then moved into the mercantile business in 1847. In 1855 he moved the business to Cassopolis, Michigan, and was engaged in it until 1875. Smith also owned extensive property around Cassopolis. He reached the rank of captain in the Ohio militia, and was appointed major in the militia organized in Cass County in 1842, though at the only muster of the latter militia, almost all of the troops were drunk on whiskey. Smith held various positions in local politics, including township supervisor, justice of the peace, and president of Cassopolis, and was a delegate to the Second Convention of Assent held in Ann Arbor to approve the terms Congress had offered for Michigan's statehood. He was elected as a Democrat to the first session of the Michigan House of Representatives after the state constitution was adopted in 1835, and re- elected in 1837.

During and a few years after World War II, at least seven U.S. servicemen were executed by the United States Armed Forces by order of a general court martial between 1942 and 1947 at Schofield Barracks, all the cases involving either murder or rape. The executions were mostly by hanging and at least one of the executed servicemen was shot by a firing squad. In 1957, Hawaii, then still an organized incorporated territory of the United States, abolished the death penalty. Hawaii became a state in 1959. Aside from Alaska, it is the only U.S. state that has never had the death penalty while a state.

Situated at the southern extreme of the Homathko Icefield, Mount Bute has an impressive 800-metre sheer granite west face, and Bute Glacier dominates the north aspect. This imposing mountain is visible from Waddington Harbour at the head of Bute Inlet, in a remote wilderness area that few visit. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Grenville, to the east-northeast. Mount Grenville is the highest summit of the icefield. Mount Bute is southeast of Mount Waddington, the highest peak of the entire Coast Mountains range. History Like Bute Inlet, the mountain was named in 1792 by Captain George Vancouver to honor John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute who was Prime Minister of Great Britain from 1762 to 1763.Andrew Scott: The Encyclopedia of Raincoast Place Names: A Complete Reference to Coastal British Columbia . Harbor Publishing, Madeira Park, BC 2009, , p. 96 Stuart's grandson Charles Stuart was a master's mate on George Vancouver's Discovery. The mountain's name became official in 1963 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Bute is located in a marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Mount Bute drains into the Southgate River which empties into Bute Inlet, except where the Bute Glacier meltwater drains into Galleon Creek. Climbing The imposing west face was first climbed in 1986 by Greg Foweraker and Don Serl. The second ascent was accomplished three days later by Fred Beckey, Kit Lewis, and Jim Nelson.American Alpine Club The School of Rock route (YDS 5.11 50 pitches) was first climbed in 2009 by Jimmy Martinello, Bruce Kay, and Jason Sinnes.School of Rock on Mount Bute ReferencesExternal links *Aerial photo of north face PBase *Aerial photo of west face PBase *Aerial photo of east face PBase * Mount Bute Weather forecast Bute Bute ","title":"Mount Bute"},{"id":"59097491","text":"Trinity Church in the estate Pervitino The main house of the estate Pervitino Pervitino () is an estate located in Pervitino village in 15 kilometres from Likhoslavl, Tver Oblast, Russia, on the left bank of the Kava river.

He was the son of former President of Kyrgyzstan Askar Akayev and the first husband of Aliya Nazarbayeva, the youngest daughter of former Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev. He was born in late February in 1976 in Leningrad, RSFSR, Soviet Union (now Saint Petersburg, Russia). At this time, his father Askar was a professor at the Leningrad Institute of Precision Mechanics and Optics where he met Aidar's mother Mayram. A year after his birth, Akayev and his family moved to the city of Frunze (now Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan) in the Kyrgyz SSR. His father became president of now independent Kyrgyz Republic in October 1990. Aidar studied at the University of Maryland and graduated in 1998 with a degree in management and business. Moving back to Kyrgyzstan later that year, he became director of the Representative Office of Kazkommertsbank OJSC in Bishkek, before moving to Almaty, Kazakhstan, where he worked in Kazkommertsbank, which is the largest bank in the country. While working in Almaty, Akayev who was then 24 years old, met 18-year-old Aliya Nazarbayeva, the daughter of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, and married her in 1999. The marriage was short-lived however, with the two separating in 2001. The marriage was according to the BBC, \\"seen by many people as a return to the old Central Asian tradition of cementing political ties with family ones.\\" In February 2001, he served as a chief Advisor to the Minister of Finance of Kyrgyzstan. From December 23, 2004 ‚Äì March 30, 2005, Akayev served as President of the National Olympic Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as the President of the Boxing Federation of Kyrgyzstan concurrently. On January 18, 2005, Akayev filed an application for participation in the February parliamentary elections, in which he was elected to parliament with 79.65% of the vote. His older sister Bermet Akayeva was also elected to the Jogorku Kenesh which caused great outcry on part of the opposition and popular protests because the election results were seen as rigged. The events that unfolded in the country became known as the Tulip Revolution. It culminated on March 24, 2005 when the crowds took over the presidential palace in Bishkek and his father along with his family was forced to flee by a helicopter to neighboring Kazakhstan. Akayev was deprived of all government posts, including his membership in Jogorku Kenesh, with the country's prosecutor general bringing criminal charges against him on the count of embezzlement of state funds, financial fraud and misappropriation of another's property under threat of force. Akayev then lived in exile with his father in Moscow, where his father is a professor at Moscow State University. Russian Federation refused to return him to the Kyrgyz authorities. Beside the Kyrgyz language, Akayev was also fluent in Russian and English. Akayev died in Moscow on 5 February 2020 from sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 43.

After relieving Patras, on 1 October, Ali sent Ismael Gibraltar into the Gulf of Corinth, where he destroyed the commercial port of Galaxeidi; 34 vessels were captured and the rest of the town's fleet, the largest in western Greece, burned. In 1824, he was placed by the ruler of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, in command of a fleet of three frigates and ten sloops, with some 3,000 Albanian troops, to capture the island of Kasos, whose inhabitants had been raiding Ottoman shipping during the previous years. The Egyptian force landed on 19 June 1824, catching the Kasiots completely unaware.

The name waffle comes from the grid pattern created by the reinforcing ribs. Waffle slabs are preferred for spans greater than , as they are much stronger than flat slabs, flat slabs with drop panels, two-way slabs, one-way slabs, and one-way joist slabs.Section of a waffle slab including beam, ribs, and column head  Description  A waffle slab is flat on top, while joists create a grid like surface on the bottom. The grid is formed by the removal of molds after the concrete sets. This structure was designed to be more solid when used on longer spans and with heavier loads. This type of structure, because of its rigidity, is recommended for buildings that require minimal vibration, like laboratories and manufacturing facilities. It is also used in buildings that require big open spaces, like theatres or train stations. Waffle slabs are composed by intricate formwork, and may be more expensive than other types of slabs, but depending on the project and the quantity of concrete needed it may be cheaper to build. There are two types of waffle slab system: # One way waffle slab system # Two way waffle slab system The only difference of these two types of slabs is how are the ribs arranged.  Construction process  A waffle slab can be made in different ways but generic forms are needed to give the waffle shape to the slab. The formwork is made up of many elements: waffle pods, horizontal supports, vertical supports, cube junctions, hole plates, clits and steel Bars. First the supports are built, then the pods are arranged in place, and finally the concrete is poured. This process may occur in three different approaches, however the basic method is the same in each: * In situ: Formwork construction and pouring of concrete occur on site, then the slab is assembled (if required). * Precast: The slabs are made somewhere else and then brought to the site and assembled. * Pre-fabricated: The reinforcements are integrated into the slab while being manufactured, without needing to reinforce the assembly on site. This is the most expensive option. = Waffle slab design = Different guides have been made for architects and engineers to determine various parameters of waffle slabs, primarily the overall thickness and rib dimensions. The following are rules of thumb, which are explained further in the accompanying diagrams: Diagram shows slab and rib width with rules of thumb formula * Slab depth is typically to thick. As a rule of thumb, the depth should be of the span. * The width of the ribs is typically to , and ribs usually have steel rod reinforcements. * The distance between ribs is typically . * The height of the ribs and beams should be of the span between columns. * The width of the solid area around the column should be of the span between columns. Its height should the same as the ribs. Diagram showing waffle slab rib and Beam Heights rule of thumb formulas. Diagram shows the width of the column head with rule of thumb formula  Advantages  The waffle slab floor system has several advantages: * Better for buildings that require less vibrationsthis is managed by the two way joist reinforcements that form the grid. * Bigger spans can be achieved with less material, being more economical and environmentally friendly * Some people find the waffle pattern aesthetically pleasing * Greater load capacity than traditional one-way slabs * Forms can be implemented with wood, concrete or steel * If holes are provided between the ribs, building services can be run through them. One proprietary implementation of this system is called Holedeck.  Disadvantages  * Greater quantities of formwork materials are needed, which can be very costly * Waffle slabs are thicker than flat slabs, so the height between each floor must be greater to have enough space for the slab system and other building services * Waffle slabs are preferred for flat topographical areas not sloped sites  Examples  * Royal National Theatre, London, United Kingdom *Washington Metro Building * Logistic and Telecommunication SL, Madrid, Spain * Barangaroo House, Sydney, Australia * GS1 Portugal, Lisboa, Portugal * Galbraith Hall, UC San Diego, California * odD House, Quito, Ecuador See also * Waffle slab foundation * Reinforced concrete * Concrete slab * Formwork  References  Floors Concrete buildings and structures Concrete Reinforced concrete Structural system ","title":"Waffle slab"},{"id":"59097589","text":"George Huxley ( c.1687‚Äì1744), of Stoke, Buckinghamshire, was a British politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1722 to 1741.

Early History: The Ottoman Empire In ancient times Plutarch wrote of oil bubbling from the ground near Kirkuk, but oil exploration does not begin until the 20th century when the Ottoman Empire granted a concession allowing William Knox D'Arcy to explore oil fields in the territories which, after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, became the modern countries of Iran and Iraq. Though the company, called African and Eastern Concession Ltd, was unable to find oil at first, D'Arcy and other European partners founded the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) in 1912. TPC was formed with the purpose of acquiring concessions from the Ottoman Empire to explore for oil in Mesopotamia. The owners were a group of large European companies: Deutsche Bank; the Anglo Saxon Oil Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell; the National Bank of Turkey, a British concern; and Turkish-born Armenian businessman Calouste Gulbenkian. The driving force behind TPC's creation was Gulbenkian, while the largest single shareholder was the British Government-controlled Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which held 50% of the shares by 1914. TPC received a promise of a concession from the Ottoman government but the outbreak of World War I in 1914 put a stop to all exploration plans. Aftermath of World War I After the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the British gained control of Mosul in 1921, and the British-backed Faisal I of Iraq became the first King of Iraq. Kirkuk district: an oil gusher spouting with a stream of oil in foreground. In 1925, TPC obtained a 75-year concession to explore for oil in exchange for a promise that the Iraqi government would receive a royalty for every ton of oil extracted. A well at Baba Gurgur was located by geologist J.M. Muir just north of Kirkuk. Drilling started, and in the early hours of 14 October 1927 oil was struck. Many tons of oil were spilled before the gushing well was brought under control, and the oil field soon proved to be extensive. Discovery of oil in Kirkuk hastened the negotiations over the composition of TPC, and on 31 July 1928 shareholders signed a formal partnership agreement to include the Near East Development Corporation (NEDC) ‚Äî an American consortium of five large US oil companies that included Standard Oil of New Jersey, Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony), Gulf Oil, the Pan-American Petroleum and Transport Company, and Atlantic Richfield Co.. (By 1935 only Standard Oil of New Jersey and Standard Oil of New York were left). The agreement was called the Red Line Agreement for the \\"red line\\" drawn around the former boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (with the exception of Kuwait), and it effectively bound the partners to act together within the red line. Writer and former IPC employee Stephen Hemsley Longrigg noted that \\"[T]he Red Line Agreement, variously assessed as a sad case of wrongful cartelization or as an enlightened example of international co‚Äëoperation and fair-sharing, was to hold the field for twenty years and in large measure determined the pattern and tempo of oil development over a large part of the Middle East\\". TPC shares were held in the following proportions: 23.75% each to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Royal Dutch/Shell, the Compagnie Fran√ßaise des P√©troles (CFP), and the NEDC; the remaining 5% went to Calouste Gulbenkian. In 1929, the TPC was renamed the Iraq Petroleum Company.. Between 1925 and 1931 the government of Iraq received a lump sum payment of ¬£400,000, but after 1931 the government was paid a royalty of 4 gold shillings per ton of crude oil produced. (This royalty was increased to six shillings in August 1950.) In 1931, the Iraqi government and IPC reached an agreement for a new 70 year concession, in exchange for increased payments to Iraq and an agreement that two pipelines to the Mediterranean would be built by 1935. By this time the Mosul Oil Company was already operated by IPC, and when the company was granted a third concession in 1938 the Basrah Petroleum Company was created to develop assets in Iraq's southern regions. The Red Line Agreement lasted until 1948 when two of the American partners broke free. During the period, IPC monopolized oil exploration inside the Red Line; excluding Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, where ARAMCO (formed in 1944 by renaming of the Saudi subsidiary of Standard Oil of California (Socal)) and Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) respectively held controlling position. Iraqi Petroleum Company Following the creation of the State of Israel the Iraq-Haifa pipeline was shut down, and in its place a new line was built from Kirkuk to the Syrian Mediterranean port of Baniyas. The pipelines were closed between November 1956 and March 1957 when Syrian pumping stations were destroyed during the Suez crisis, which caused a financial crisis in Iraq. Iraq could not transport its oil through the Persian Gulf while the Suez Canal remained closed, so the closure of the Mediterranean pipelines meant Iraqi oil production ground to a standstill. After Muhammad Mossadegh nationalized the oil industry in Iran, IPC agreed to accept an \\"equal profit sharing\\" arrangement in 1952. Instead of a flat royalty payment, Iraq would be paid 12.5% of the sale price of each barrel. However, foreign company control of Iraq's oil assets was unpopular and in 1958 Abd al-Karim Qasim overthrew Faisal II of Iraq. After seizing control of the Iraqi government, Qasim demanded better terms from IPC but decided against nationalization of Iraq's petroleum assets. In 1961 Iraq passed Public Law 80 whereby Iraq expropriated 95% of IPC's concessions and the Iraq National Oil Company was created and empowered to develop the assets seized from IPC under Law 80. This arrangement continued in 1970 when the government demanded even more control over IPC, eventually nationalizing IPC after negotiations between the company and the government broke down. By this time the Ba'ath Party was in power in Iraq and Saddam Hussein was its de facto ruler, although Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr did not formally step down as President until 1979. Iraq War and Post-War developments In February 2007, the Iraqi cabinet approved a draft law that would distribute oil revenues to the various regions and provinces of Iraq based on population, and would also give regional oil companies the authority to enter into contractual arrangements directly with foreign companies concerning the exploration and development of oil fields. Iraqis remained divided over provisions allowing regional governments to enter into contracts directly with foreign companies; while strongly supported by Kurds, Sunni Arabs wanted the Oil Ministry to retain signing power. As a compromise the draft law proposed that a new body called the Federal Oil and Gas Council would be created that could, in some circumstances, prevent execution of contracts signed by regional governments. This arrangement would undo the nationalization of the Iraqi oil industry that dates back to 1972. Under Article I of the 2010 Law of Income Taxation on Foreign Oil Companies Working in Iraq, there is a 35% tax on \\"income earned in Iraq from the contracts signed with the Foreign Oil Companies, their subsidiaries, branches, or offices and their subcontractors working in Iraq in the field of oil and gas extraction and production and the relevant industries\\". The production contracts, which foreign oil companies enter into with the Iraqi federal or regional governments, often include revenue-sharing terms as well.

CeV is a dsDNA virus.  History and taxonomy  CeV was discovered in the Norwegian coastal waters in 1998. It was then isolated and characterized. It was then believed to belong to the phycodnaviridae along with all other known algae infecting viruses. The discovery of Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus helped to discover that there existed marine mimiviruses that could infect microalgae. A CeV strain was later found in the Gulf of Main in 2013 and the phylogenetic analysis of some specific marker confirmedits proximity with mimiviruses. In 2015,CeV was fully sequenced to classify it as a mimiviridae It was more recently proposed a group of mimiviridae infecting microalgae that would include CeV together with Phaeocystis globosa virus (PgV) infecting a haptophyceae and Aureococcus anophagefferens virus (AaV) infecting a stramenopile.

It is predicted to have 512 ORFs. CeV possess a large number of core genes like the major capsid protein and the DNA polymerase B close to the respective genes of PgV. CeV may have the ability to repair its DNA as it is suggested by the presence of the sequences of MutS7 and an ERCC4-type DNA repair nuclease (which are involved in DNA repair). This last enzyme is typically used for repairing DNA damage caused by UV light which is consistent with the habitat of a mimiviridae infecting a photosynthetic host.

The National War Labor Board was a court of appeal where principles of the Labor Administration were involved in dispute\\". An early act was to adopt principles and policies of the National War Labor Board. Frankfurter also had a seat on the War Industries Board. The board formulated unified policies regarding labor administration during World War I. It also promoted improved housing for workers during World War I. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the board reviewed how to cancel government contracts and demobilization. It also studied wartime labor conditions at home and abroad, plus US postwar labor policies.

The resulting increase in cases of infectious diseases led to a government probe, the arrest of several prominent directors of Monozyme India, and widespread criticism being levied against the healthcare system of West Bengal.  Description = Background = The blood test scam took place in the Indian State of West Bengal. Due to the region's lower level of economic development, the West Bengali medical system of the early 2000s was noted as being underfunded and thus providing substandard care.Shah, Mansi (2007). \\"Waiting for health care: a survey of a public hospital in Kolkata\\" (PDF). Centre for Civil Society. Archived from the original (PDF) on 13 August 2011. Retrieved 31 January 2012.http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/sereport/ser/wbm/wbm_cont.pdf Despite these shortcomings, the Bengali medical system did contain a number of public and private blood banks, which provided the wider system with a supply of blood. To ensure that donated blood was safe to use in blood transfusions, the various banks and hospitals used blood test kits to test blood for infectious diseases. = Sale of defective tests = In 2004, several West Bengali healthcare facilities placed a new contract for blood test kits; these new kits would be used to help detect Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV in blood, thus allowing for safer transfusions. Several bids were made, with one Secunderabad-based company, Monozyme India, winning the contract. It was later revealed that Monozyme India had offered to sell blood test kits for 20 Rupees a unit, as opposed to the 60-70 rupees offered by other companies. Among dozens of other facilities, Monozyme India provided kits to 8 blood transfusion centers in West Bengal. Starting in 2005, an uptick of blood- transmissible disease infections was reported by several medical facilities in West Bengal. These reports were investigated, and in September 2006 the NRS Medical College Blood Bank uncovered that thousands of blood test kits sold by Monozyme India had had their expiration date tampered with or removed. Testing found that these older, expired tests were defective and thus unable to determine if blood was infected. In response, the Indian police raided over 75 facilities that may be in possession of expired blood test kits, and a warning was sent out by the West Bengali healthcare network. As a result of the police raids, it was found that Monozyme India had sold 140,000 defective blood test kits between December 2004 and August 2006. In light of the findings of West Bengal police and healthcare system, an investigation was launched regarding potential negligence by Monozyme India. In particular, there was concern that the company had knowingly violated the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, which prohibited the tampering of expiration dates of drugs. Random tests on the seized blood test kits showed that almost all of the kits were defective in some way; as such, legal and criminal action was taken against several high- level employees at Monozyme India. Particular focus was placed on two brothers, Ghanashyam and Govind Sarda. Govind was the owner of Monozyme India, and Ghanashyam had been managing director of the company from April 2005 to August 2006. Ghanashyam received considerable coverage in the media after he was arrested at an airport in Calcutta, allegedly while attempting to flee the ongoing investigation. Govind was also arrested. = Aftermath = In the aftermath of the situation, Indian authorities conducted a number of probes into the healthcare system of West Bengal.

Colovin was born in London, Ontario in 1842 to Irish immigrants Charles and Rose (O‚ÄôReilly) Colovin. He is the brother of Matthew F. Colovin (1840-1900), the first professor of law at the University of Notre Dame. Patrick Colovin was educated in Montreal at the College de Saint-Laurent, where he was ordained in May 1867. Rev. Edward Sorin insisted that Colovin be appointed superior in Montreal shortly thereafter. In 1871-72, Father Sorin assigned Colovin to the University of Notre Dame as professor of Christian Doctrine (Moral Philosophy) and French. From 1872-74 he served as associate pastor of St. Bernard‚Äôs Parish (with Rev. William Corby, C.S.C) and as Director of Studies and Professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy and Classics at Our Lady of the Sacred Cross (later named Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, Wisconsin.  President of the University of Notre Dame  Colovin was noticed while he was working at Sacred Heart College in Watertown with Rev. William Corby and was made vice-president at the request of Lemmonier. After the death of Rev. Auguste Lemmonier, Rev. Edward Sorin tapped him to be the new president. Colovin had an insubordinate temper and was often at odds with Fr. Sorin; he was popular among Irish students and his celebration of St. Patrick's Day was disapproved by Sorin. His tenure saw economic difficulties due to the post-war period and lower student enrollment, and he was forced to resign in 1877.  After Notre Dame  Following his tenure at Notre Dame he returned to Watertown as pastor of St. Bernard‚Äôs, and remained there until April, 1880. He was next assigned to a parish in Lead in the Black Hills, South Dakota, where he served from 1880 - 81. In 1882 Father Colovin returned to his native London, Ontario and, after a rocky relationship with Father Sorin, was released from the Congregation of Holy Cross. By 1883 Father Colovin was affiliated with Sacred Heart Parish in London, Ontario.

Foundation The city of Port-au-Prince had been founded as the official capital of the colony in 1750. At this point, theater and music was immensely popular in the colony and frequented by most free people of all races and classes, and public theaters existed in not only Cap-Francais but also in smaller towns such as the theaters of Mlle Marthe and Mlle Francheville in Saint-Marc (1769‚Äì1802), Monsieur Passete in Leogane (1760s) and Monsieur Charpentier in Les Cayes (1765‚Äì88), and it was considered necessary to have one in the new capital city. In 1762, a first theater was managed by the three joint-directors Rouzier, Claude Clement and Charpentier, but it did not last. A permanent theater was finally established by the theater director Francois Mesplete (d. 1784), who founded the Com√©die de Port-au-Prince in 1778. Activity It was a playhouse with room for 750 people. The theater offered regular performances of drama, opera and music concerts until the Haitian Revolution of 1791, and became an important cultural center. The theater employed a stock company of eight actors, eight actresses, eleven musicians, a prompter, a stage manager, a decorator, a tailor, a hairdresser, four porters and a clerk. Francois Mesplete was succeeded in 1784 by Monsieur Acquaire, whose wife the singer- actress Madame Acquaire (previously Mlle Babet) had been a director of the local amateur theater in Gonaive, are known as the mentor of the famous Minette et Lise. Another star attraction of the theater was the violinist Monsieur Petit. Destruction After the outbreak of the Haitian Revolution, Acquaire resigned his position as director to Monsieur Blainville and joined his wife in France. Blainville attempted to use the theater as a venue to reconcile the tensions of the colony during the revolution, an attempt which was well received, as the activity of the theater was reportedly in full operation right up until the night of the 22 November 1791, when Port-au- Prince was attacked and burnt, during which the theater was among the buildings destroyed.

In western European countries and the United States, it is sometimes referred to as the Czech M53 helmet. These helmets are commonly mistaken for, and sometimes marketed as, Soviet SSh-40 helmets, and various other very similar Eastern Bloc helmets.  History  The liner of Vz. 53/80. This type of lining was also used in the German Stahlhelm Czech seal of approval, manufacture date (1954), and the size (2) of the Vz. 53/80 pictured here After World War II, the Soviet Union provided Czechoslovakia with Soviet SSh-39 and SSh-40 helmets for their newly formed military. These helmets were refitted with leather liners, much like the ones seen in the German Stahlhelm. These designs became the Vz. 52, which was the predecessor of the Vz. 53. Vz. 52 helmets that were constructed with the use of the Russian shells can be easily identified by a ring of 6 rivets around the head-band area of the shell and an additional 3 rivets up high near the top of the helmet. Czechoslovakia exported Vz. 52 and Vz. 53 helmets to many countries. They were used by the North Vietnamese Army in the Vietnam War, and were also sent to various Eastern Bloc countries. These helmets can even be found in some modern conflicts in the Middle East, specifically in Afghanistan and Iraq. Many of the helmets found in the Middle East are leftover from the Cold War. In the 1980s, Czechoslovakia replaced the leather strap with a four-point nylon strap along with a leather chin guard. This helmet came to be known as the Vz. 53/80, and was used as recently as 2004. A version of the Vz. 53/80 is currently being used by Afghanistan Military Police forces, renamed the Afghanistan Vz. 53/80.  Design  The Vz. 53 incorporates designs from a variety of different countries, specifically Germany and the USSR. The shape of the shell is an exact copy of the Soviet SSh-39 and SSh-40 shell, and a very small percentage of helmets are actually SSh-40's refitted with the Vz. 53's leather liner. These are the original helmets sent to Czechoslovakia by the USSR in the early 1950s as a way to support their renewed military. The leather liner is a copy of the German Stahlhelm's, which is a good way to tell it apart from other similar Eastern Bloc helmets. = Identification = As military souvenirs, Vz. 53 helmets may be marketed online as a 'Soviet WW2 Helmet' to appeal to consumers more. Although the Soviet SSh-39 and SSh-40 helmet shells do look similar to a Vz. 53, there are many ways to tell them apart.

He was born one of nine in Lacolle, Quebec, son of Thomas Walsh and Winifred McDermott. He was educated at the College de Saint-Laurent, where he caught the attention of Rev. Edward Sorin, who saw his potential. He finished his studies there in 1872 and entered the Novitiate. Sorin sent him to study at College de Ste. Croix in Neuilly, close to Paris, where he spent three years. He was recalled to Notre Dame in 1876 in order to improve enrollment. He was ordained a priest on August 29th, 1877 by Bishop Joseph Dwenger of Fort Wayne and then assumed the role of Dean of Students. After the great fire of 1879, Walsh was in charge of rescheduling classes and professors in the newly reopened college, and his administrative ability led Sorin and William Corby to pick him as next president in 1881. He died of kidney disease at the age of 40. Walsh Hall at the University of Notre Dame was dedicated in his honor.  President of the University of Notre Dame  As president, Walsh interest was in bolstering Notre Dame's scholastic reputation and standards. At the time, many students came to Notre Dame for its business courses only, and did not graduate. He started a \\"Belles Lettres\\" programs and invited many notable lay intellectuals to campus, including Maurice Francis Egan, and started reconstructing the library which was lost in the fire. Walsh reorganized the law school and in 1882 he built the Science Hall. He also built Sorin Hall which was the first freestanding residence hall on campus and one of the first in the country to have private rooms for students. Walsh was initially against this innovation, as he believed private rooms would lead to disciplinary issues, but this project was championed by Sorin and John Zahm. During his tenure, Notre Dame started its football program and started awarding the Laetare Medal.

The format of the work and its composition are based on religious triptychs of the Renaissance, like those by Matthias Gr√ºnewald. It was begun in 1929 and completed in 1932, and has been held by the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden since 1968. It is one of several anti-war works done by Dix in the 1920s, inspired by his experience of trench warfare in the First World War. Background Dix was an art student in Dresden before the First World War. He was conscripted in 1915, and served in the Imperial German Army as a machine gunner on the Eastern and Western Fronts. He returned to study at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, and then in Italy. After the war, he was a founder of the short-lived avante-garde Dresdner Sezession art group, and then supported the post-expressionist New Objectivity movement. The anti-war art that Dix created after 1920 was inspired by his horrific experiences in the trenches. Before this triptych, he completed his large anti-war painting The Trench in 1923, which caused great controversy when first exhibited, and he published a portfolio of fifty prints also entitled Der Krieg in 1924. Dix became a professor at the Dresden Academy in 1927. He started working on the triptych soon after the tenth anniversary of the end of the First World War, as a reaction to the popular public perception of the war as a heroic experience. The painting was first exhibited at the autumn exhibition of the Berlin Academy of Arts in 1932. Many of Dix's works were condemned as degenerate art by the Nazi Party, but the triptych was hidden by Dix and survived. Several of Dix's preparatory cartoons are held by the Hamburger Kunsthalle. The War was bought by the Galerie Neue Meister in Dresden for 500,000 Deutsche Marks in 1968. Description The triptych has three main panels, with a fourth as a supporting panel or predella below the main central panel. The large central panel is a square; the flanking panels to either side the same height but half the width, each; and the predella below the central panel has the same width but is only high. From left to right, the left wing depicts a column of German soldiers marching away from the viewer through the fog of war towards the battle in the central scene. The central panel shows a devastated urban landscape scattered with war paraphernalia and body parts, reworking the themes in his 1923 work The Trench, and divided like the 16th century Isenheim Altarpiece of Mathias Gr√ºnewald with a living side to the lower left and a dead side to the upper right. A skeletal figure floats above the scene, pointing to the right, with a soldier in gas mask below, and scabrous legs upended to the right, recalling the legs of Christ in Gr√ºnewald's crucifixion scene. The right wing shows several figures withdrawing from the fight. A dominant greyish figure, helping a wounded comrade, is a self-portrait of Dix himself, in a composition similar to a descent from the cross or a piet√†. In the predella, several soldiers are lying next to each other, possibly sleeping under an awning, or perhaps they represent the dead in a tomb. This fourth panel is based on The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb by Hans Holbein the Younger. The painting uses a restricted palette of mainly dark colours, with cold greens, greys, and whites for death and decay, and warm reds and oranges for blood, destruction and shellfire.

After their deaths, Riverside High School and the Launceston Walking Club submitted plans to the Scenery Preservation Board for a memorial hut at Lake Rodway. Assisted by members of the North West Walking Club, work began in September 1965. The hut was dedicated by headmaster John Walker on 3 April 1966. Walking trip The Riverside High Outdoor SocietyAddress given by John Walker to the Riverside High School \\"40 Years On Reunion Dinner\\" was a club for students interested in bushwalking, giving them opportunities for day and overnight walks. A five-day walk through the northern half of the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair Reserve (as it was then known), from the Pelion area to Waldheim, was planned for May 1965. Three teachers were co-leaders:Inquest report, The Examiner (4 August 1965), p. 8. science teacher John Chick, who had bushwalking and leadership experience; physical-education teacher Rosemary Bayes; and teacher-in-training Ewen Scott, a member of the Launceston Walking Club. They left Launceston on Sunday, 16 May 1965, with 16 students: 15 from Riverside High School and a friend of the principal from Sydney. The walk began at the Arm River Track on the Upper Mersey River. The party split in two during the walk to Pelion Hut because of the students' different walking paces: \\"The first party arrived at the hut about 5pm and the stragglers got in half an hour later. Conditions were cloudy with occasional light showers\\".John Chick, The Examiner (4 August 1965), p. 8. The party remained in Pelion Hut on Monday night, and walked to Windemere Hut on Tuesday. Chick arrived with the slower members of the party at dark: \\"The physical condition of the leaders and pupils was excellent. However, it was becoming clear that there were some members of the party who walked slower than others\\". The first members of the party arrived at the Waterfall Valley hut on Wednesday in the mid-afternoon. The others arrived about 5 pm, while it was still light. Snow had fallen the night before, but during the day \\"conditions were perfect. Some snow and rain fell when the party was nearly at Waterfall Valley hut\\". According to Chick, \\"On Thursday morning, intermittent rain continued, and we deliberately delayed our departure to the latest practicable time, hoping for some let-up in the weather. It eased, and we set off about noon\\". At 1 pm, the party were on the Cirque between Barn Bluff and Cradle Mountain. The wind was blowing \\"in excess of 60 m.p.h. There was no actual snow falling, but the wind was driving a lot of ground snow along\\". The party had decided the night before that if conditions were poor they would take the Lake Rodway track to Waldheim instead of the more-exposed Kitchen Hut route. Chick told the inquest, \\"I was in the lead of the party at this stage. Scott had been leading throughout the walk. He knew the area, and I was content to follow and look after the slow ones‚Ä¶ This was the only time in the expedition our positions were reversed\\". Scott took the lead again at Lake Rodway, while Chick dropped behind with three girls. On Thursday, past Lake Rodway, the party realised that they were in trouble. Rodney Howell, one of the students, was the first to exhibit exhaustion. The party stopped for about 10 minutes on the southern slopes of Hansons Peak to distribute the contents of his pack and eat. When the walk resumed, Chick was in the rear with three girls and Scott was in front with the others \\"by a slowly increasing distance\\": \\"Weather conditions were cold; there was still a strong wind blowing but there was no snow falling. There were occasional showers. At this stage, it was about 4 o‚Äôclock and visibility was poor. We could not see from one party to the other.\\" On the climb to Hansons Peak, 14-year-old David Kilvert collapsed for the first time. Scott began assisting Kilvert, who \\"was now in poor shape\\", at about 4:30 pm and sent three students ahead to obtain help from the park ranger at Waldheim. The party was now split into four groups. Three students (Diane Batten, Peter Williams and Bernard Hay) had gone ahead to get help. Teacher Rosemary Bayes and eight students were in the main group. Just behind the main group was Scott, who was assisting David Kilvert; Chick, three girls and a boy were in the rear. The four groups walked over Hansons Peak as darkness fell. The three students in the front group reached Dove Lake. Unaware that a road had recently been constructed from Waldheim to the lake, they remained on the walking track (which led to Waldheim via Lake Lilla). Dianne Batten told the inquest: The main group, led by Bayes, spent the night in the Dove Lake boat shed. The rear group, out of contact with the others, lost the track on the slopes of Hansons Peak and spent the night in a sheltered location. The last person to see Scott and Kilvert alive was 15-year-old Mark Whittle, just after he was sent ahead to join the main group on the ascent of Hansons Peak. Whittle and another student had been helping Kilvert until Scott said something like, \\"You go on and leave David with me\\": \\"Mr Scott was carrying David in his arms and they fell and tumbled down a bank from the track. It was a drop of about six feet. The last I saw of them they were still lying there, but they were making an attempt to get up and I felt they were all right\\".Mark Whittle, The Examiner (4 August 1965), p. 8. Whittle did not offer assistance to Scott and Kilvert because \\"I won't say he [Scott] ordered us to go on, but he told us very firmly\\". Kilvert‚Äôs body was found the next day, about 400 metres from where Whittle had last seen him, off the track:Coroner's Report on David Kilvert \\"I don't know whether he fell down or whether in fact Ewen Scott had actually placed him there. Ewen may have realised that the others may have come along behind and he didn't want them to find David.\\" Scott died of exhaustion and exposure.Coroner's Report on Ewen Scott His body was found a short distance from Dove Lake, near the end of the new road which had been constructed the previous year. Whittle said, \\"It seems that, after carrying David Kilvert for some distance, Ewen Scott realised that David was fading, or perhaps had passed away. No-one knows exactly what happened, but it seems that Ewen left David and set off to get help\\". Pat Wessing, who was staying at the Blandfordia Alpine Hut in Cradle Valley, made the discovery:Blandfordia Alpine Club, Log Book 1 Scott, born on 1 January 1939, was educated at Launceston Technical High School and worked in industrial chemistry with Patons and Baldwins in Launceston.

It was built by Riverside High School and Launceston Walking Club with help from other organisations, such as the North West Walking Club. Plans were drawn up by architect Arnold Rowlands, a member of the North West Walking Club whose wife Mavis was a cousin of Scott. The plan was approved by the Scenic Preservation Board, and work began at the Lake Rodway site in September 1965, under the cliffs of the southern face of Cradle Mountain. The Board had wanted a hut on Lake Rodway for some time, but had been unable to finance it.Skyline No. 16 (October 1966), p. 15. Near the hut was a good supply of building material. King Billy pines for timber required came from nearby, gravel for the foundation came from the lake, and stone for the hut walls came from a small hill 100 metres away. Due to the size of the hut and the distance from the nearest road at Dove Lake (6 kilometres, with a 500-metre climb), a helicopter was used to move material which could not be sourced locally. An Ansett-ANA helicopter made 53 round trips in one weekend, moving 14 tons of material to the site at a cost of about $1,000. After several alterations to the plans, and with the support of the North West Walking Club, an additional six tons of timber was carried in by pack.They Built a Hut, LWC DVD, 1966, 12:20 Work parties, supervised by professional builder and keen bushwalker Stan Brodziak, were on site every other weekend during the construction period.They Built a Hut, LWC DVD, 1966, 21:45 A total of 15 weekends were required. In January, ten people stayed for a week and transformed the hut from a bare frame to an almost-liveable hut with a porch, asbestos roofing tiles (supplied at a discount by a local cement company),They Built a Hut, LWC DVD, 1966, 18:50 and a fireplace.

For its main supports, eight King Billy pine trees were felled and floated 300 metres across Lake Rodway. Each support, weighing about , was moved into place by hand. The hut accommodates about 30 people in the upstairs sleeping area. It took 10,000 man-hours and 38 working days to complete, and was officially opened on 3 April 1966. The weather was poor, and walkers began arriving in steady rain at 10 am. At noon, almost 300 people had assembled to see the hut and hear speeches. The plaque was unveiled by Riverside High School headmaster John Walker.They Built a Hut, LWC DVD, 1966, 22:30 ReferencesExternal links *Inquest opening speech (The Examiner, 4 August 1965) *Scott-Kilvert, 50 Years On Mountain huts in Australia Buildings and structures in Tasmania Central Highlands (Tasmania) ","title":"Scott-Kilvert Memorial Hut"},{"id":"59098918","text":"Aluminium sesquichlorohydrate is an aluminium salt that is used as an antiperspirant agent, a deodorant agent, and a cosmetic astringent.

Unveiled in 1922, it commemorates the 578 men of Folkestone who served in the First World War, and those who passed through Folkestone Harbour during the war, when Folkestone Harbour railway station nearby was an important point of departure and return for passage to the Western Front via Boulogne. The road from the station to the harbour was renamed the \\"Road of Remembrance\\" after the war. The memorial was organised by a committee chaired by Sir Stephen Penfold, who had served as mayor of Folkestone twelve times from 1888 to 1918, including four years consecutively from 1914 to 1918. He was knighted in 1915 for his service in receiving refugees from Belgian after the outbreak of the war. His son Jeffrey was killed in at the Battle of Loos on 1916. The memorial was designed by Ferdinand Victor Blundstone. It measures high and wide and comprises a bronze statue of a woman, said to represent Motherhood and Reverence, standing on a tapering square stone pedestal with flanking stone walls, all on a stone base raised by two steps. The statue is bare-breasted, with its lower half robed. In her left hand, the figure holds aloft a cross with a union flag banner handing from its shaft, with a laurel wreath in her right hand. She faces towards the sea, and across to France beyond. The pedestal is of Cornish granite, with the inscription picked out in gold, \\"MAY THEIR / DEEDS BE / HELD IN / REVERENCE\\". The base of the central pedestal, and the flanking walls of granite to either side, have bronze plaques. The main plaque has a low relief sculpture of ranks of soldiers moving forward, recalling the men who passed by on their way to war, with an inscription that reads: \\"THANKS BE TO GOD WHO GIVETH US THE VICTORY / IN EVER GRATEFUL MEMORY OF THE BRAVE MEN FROM FOLKESTONE, / AND THE MANY THOUSANDS FROM ALL PARTS OF THE EMPIRE WHO PASSED THIS SPOT ON THEIR WAY / TO FIGHT IN THE GREAT WAR (1914-1918) FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FREEDOM, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE / OF THIS TOWN WHO MADE THE SUPREME SACRIFICE, AND WHOSE NAMES ARE HERE RECORDED, / THIS MEMORIAL IS HUMBLY DEDICATED.\\" Other panels list the names of the dead from both World Wars. The memorial was unveiled by Jacob Pleydell-Bouverie, 6th Earl of Radnor on 2 December 1922 and dedicated by the vicar of Folkestone, Peter Francis Tindall. A guard of honour was provided by the 1st battalion of the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. Flowers were laid by the Mayor of Folkestone, by Colonel W J Dugan from Shorncliffe Army Camp, and by representatives from France, Belgium and Italy. Further commemorative plaques were added after the Second World War. The memorial is now surrounded by low railings and a wall, with gates which repeat the inscription from the memorial, \\"MAY THEIR / DEEDS BE / HELD IN / REVERENCE\\". It became a Grade II* listed building in June 2010, and was refurbished in 2018. A new memorial arch was added nearby in 2014, unveiled by Prince Harry.

It can occur directly via infanticide, or indirectly via competition over resources between siblings. Avian parents often produce more offspring than they can care for, resulting in the death of some of the nestlings. Brood reduction was originally described by David Lack in his brood-reduction hypothesis to explain the existence of hatching asynchrony in many bird species. Bird nest in which hatching asynchrony is occurring.Hatching asynchrony occurs when the parents start incubating their eggs before all of them have been laid. If resources are limited, it benefits the parents to allow brood reduction, because it reduces the amount of work they must do and increases their chances of surviving and reproducing again in future years. Brood reduction has been observed in many avian species including seabirds such as black-legged kittiwakes, birds of prey such as Swainson's hawk and several eagle species, and songbirds including black-billed magpies and house wrens.  Methods of brood reduction = Infanticide = Brood reduction often occurs as infanticide, the killing nestlings by members of the same species. Infanticide can be done by siblings, which is referred to as siblicide, or by the parents, which is called filial infanticide. In virtually all species, brood reduction only occurs via siblicide, however in some species such as the white stork, filial infanticide has been observed. Siblicide often occurs via harassment and intimidation, preventing the smaller chicks from having enough food. However, fatal aggression between siblings is also common. Golden eagle nestling. Brood reduction by means of siblicide can be facultative or obligate. Facultative brood reduction depends on the conditions of that particular year, and only occurs when there is a limit to the resources available for the nestlings. Obligate brood reduction always occurs and does not depend on food availability. Hatching asynchrony results in a dominance hierarchy between the nestlings, which often leads to the death of the youngest sibling. This can be seen in several species of birds of prey, such as eagles, and depends on the size difference between the siblings and therefore the amount of time that passes between each egg hatching. In the crowned eagle, the time interval between eggs hatching is 3 days, and in this species the brood reduction observed is obligate. In other eagle species, such as the greater spotted eagle and the imperial eagle, the hatching interval is only 2 days, and the type of brood reduction observed is facultative brood reduction. = Brood parasitism = Brown-headed cowbird as a brood parasite. Brood reduction can also be done by members of a different species. This can be seen in interspecific brood parasitism. Brood parasites lay their eggs in the nest of another bird species, relying on the host parents to raise their offspring. Brood parasitism can lead to brood reduction in different ways. Some brood parasites kill the eggs of the host species so that there is no competition for their own offspring. Parasitic nestlings can also cause brood reduction by out-competing the host species nestlings, or by simply killing them. Two species of cowbirds, the shiny cowbird, and the screaming cowbird, frequently parasitize the nests of the brown-and-yellow marshbird, resulting in an increased amount of brood reduction in this species.  Lack's hypothesis  The brood-reduction hypothesis was first proposed by David Lack in 1947 to explain the evolution of hatching asynchrony and dominance hierarchy in the broods of some bird species. The hypothesis stated that hatching asynchrony exists to maximize the fitness of the nestlings in years where resources are low. During these years, the asynchronous pattern allows the brood size to be reduced to an amount that can be supported by the parents, by either directly killing the weakest nestlings or by siblings out- competing them. Hatching asynchrony would have no cost during years when resources are plentiful, and the whole brood would survive. In a study on brood reduction in the common kestrel, it was shown that when brood reduction occurred in asynchronous nests, the cellular immunity of the nestlings improved compared to those in synchronous nests. = Criticisms of the hypothesis = Lack's assumption that there is no cost associated with hatching asynchrony during years where food is plentiful can not be proven. Studies show that competition remains a factor even when there are enough resources and that the last nestling to hatch is still at a disadvantage. In orders to test Lack's hypothesis, brood reduction must be adaptive, which can be determined by comparing the success of asynchronous broods and synchronous broods. Birds that have naturally synchronous broods must have higher nestling mortality when there are insufficient resources. It has been suggested that this can be tested using artificially synchronous broods, however, this artificial manipulation may have an effect on resource use. Also, in order to test this, the brood reduction threshold must be crossed. In other words, the conditions must be poor enough for brood reduction to occur. It is also possible that brood reduction could occur even when resources are plentiful, in this case being a maladaptive trait. Another criticism of the hypothesis is that there is no general threshold for brood reduction; conditions ar not static and are not always the same for all individuals. An alternate hypothesis that builds off of Lack's is the Offspring Quality Assurance Hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the benefit to hatching asynchrony is the hierarchy created from it. The hierarchy guarantees that at least some of the nestlings will survive, and whether or not some of the weaker nestlings die is irrelevant.

Lozano is the Executive Artistic Director of the Cara M√≠a Theatre Company, where he has been involved since 2002.  Career  Lozano joined the Cara M√≠a Theatre Company in 2002, but left in 2006. By 2008, the company was in a poor financial position. In order to save it, Raul Trevino, a playwright, approached Lozano with a proposal to produce a play about a 1969 walkout in Crystal City that protested unequal treatment for Mexican-American students. The play, which would be called Crystal City 1969, was based on the experiences of those that participated in the walkout, including Trevino's uncle. Premiering in 2009, Crystal City 1969 was successful enough to keep Cara M√≠a afloat, and inspired Lozano to return and begin producing works that addressed the socioeconomic difficulties faced by Latino people. Since 2009, Lozano has focused on producing bilingual plays and elevating Cara M√≠a to a position of prominence in Dallas and North Texas. The theater has facilitated the premieres of notable Mexican-American playwrights and writers and has collaborated with the local community to become a hub for Latino arts. In 2013, Lozano wrote and directed The Dreamers: A Bloodline, the first in a trilogy called The Dreamers describing the struggles of Latino people and the immigration process. The Dreamers: A Bloodline told a story of Salvadorean emigration, and was produced by interviewing immigrants. The second part of this trilogy, Deferred Action, premiered in 2016 and told the story of a DACA recipient making their way in the United States. In 2017, Lozano directed the play Native Gardens at WaterTower Theatre, another Dallas theater company. During Lozano's time at Cara M√≠a, the company has pursued extensive community engagement by backing youth arts programs that support up to 15,000 students per year. Furthermore, Lozano has advocated for greater funding of small arts venues in Dallas, particularly in the wake of a debt financing proposal that would have granted $15 million to the AT&T; Performing Arts Center.  Notable works = Crystal City 1969 (2009) = Crystal City 1969 was produced in collaboration with Raul Trevino and premiered at Cara M√≠a in 2009. The play opened on the 40th anniversary of the 1969 walkout in Crystal City, where 85 percent of the population was Hispanic. Leading up to the walkout, inhabitants of Crystal City had suffered chronic mistreatment by politicians and law enforcement and abuse was particularly severe in the city's high school, where speaking Spanish was forbidden. The protests portrayed by Crystal City 1969 brought the city's economy to a halt in order to meet demands for equal treatment, and the standoff even received national attention. Political reforms were finally put in place after a period of 5 months. Characters are based on real participants, and the play attempted to capture the reality of the walkouts by relying on first-person accounts to shape its narrative. The play was so successful that it buoyed Cara M√≠a from near bankruptcy to an annual operating budget of $417,000. = The Dreamers: A Bloodline (2013) = The Dreamers: A Bloodline is the first in Lozano's immigration-focused trilogy. It tells the story of four Salvadorean women who are fleeing the country during a period of instability from 1979 to 1992. While the plot is simple, the structure is complicated and abstract, relying on extensive symbolism and unusual usage of time and space. The play was produced with extensive historical research that captured key themes and ideas in the experience of Salvadorean immigrants. For instance, the assassination of Archbishop √ìscar Romero in 1980 is presented in the early stages of the play. Lozano's research process included interviews with Salvadorean immigrants in North Texas, so that the play would be able to reflect real stories of immigration. = Deferred Action (2016) = Deferred Action is the second in Lozano's trilogy, and focuses on a DACA recipient in Texas named Javi who is attempting to navigate the political discussion surrounding immigration. Javi is by all accounts an upstanding member of society, but remains in danger because of his undocumented status. The conflict in the play revolves around two presidential candidates: a Democratic Latina senator named Nancy Rodriguez and an oil money-backed Republican named Dale Jenkins. Initially, it seems clear how Javi will side, but on a television appearance he criticizes the DACA in front of both candidates as being a temporary solution that fails to address the long term. In this way, the play criticizes the policy of both major American political parties. Eventually, Jenkins has a dream that transforms into a supporter of broad immigration reform, making the decision between the two candidates less clear cut. As in Lozano's previous work, Deferred Action was produced in part by interviewing DACA recipients and understanding their personal experience as undocumented immigrants.

Early and personal life Bendell was born in Albany, New York on October 28, 1843, to Elias and Hannah (n√©e Stern). His immigrant grandparents were among the first Jews to settle in the city. Career=American Civil War= Bendell entered the service in the 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment as a hospital steward in 1861 and was later appointed assistant surgeon. On September 1, 1861, he was commissioned as assistant surgeon to the 6th New York Heavy Artillery Regiment. He then returned to Albany Medical College to graduate with his class. After graduation, Dr. Bendell reentered the service as a surgeon with the 86th New York Volunteer Infantry on Feb 19, 1863. On January 3, 1865 he was promoted to surgeon and served until the end of the war, finishing as a brevetted lieutenant-colonel for meritorious service. After the war he retained his ties to the military. In September, 1866, he was appointed as examining surgeon for the Bureau of Pensions and, later, was appointed surgeon for the National Guard (New York State 3d Brigade). Bendell was a member of the Albany, NY chapter of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States . =Superintendent of Indian Affairs= In furthering President Grant's \\"Peace Policy\\" and choosing agents beyond the Quaker faith, with the urging of the Jewish community leader Simon Wolf, Bendell was appointed superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Arizona Territory. He arrived by way of San Diego and is considered the first Jew to settle in the city of Phoenix. His arrival was shortly after the infamous Camp Grant massacre. His first task was to accompany Gen. Oliver Otis Howard and members of various Indian tribes and the first Apache delegation to Washington, DC. Dr. Bendell accompanied five of the Native American chiefs on a brief excursion to his home in Albany, stopping at the temperance hotel founded by Edward C. Delavan. The five chiefs were Antonio Azul - Pima Chief in 1872 #Antonlito Azul- Pimo Chief #Louis Mohnjo- Pimo interpreter #Accension - Papago Sub-Chief #Josio Pakato - Apache Zuma #Carlos - Apache Mohave News accounts described the chiefs' 'indifference' at the sights along the Hudson River, impressed only with the view from West Point. Bendell's appointment was a difficult posting at a tumultuous time in the Arizona Territory. The government intended to move the Apache tribes to reservations with a farming lifestyle. Dr. Bendell's report to Washington Indian Affairs commissioner Francis Amasa Walker, reprinted in New York Times, notes the tribal reluctance to accept the reservation conditions offered by the Government and the Native American hoarding of rations for the purpose of renewing raids upon settlers. Dr. Bendell was the superior officer of agent Tom Jeffords, chosen by Apache chief Cochise after a treaty made with General Oliver Otis Howard. Bendell petitioned for an increased budget as the original allocation was for three Chiricahua reservations, and by 1872 there were seven. Many Indian agents of the time were accused of pilfering from the government monies allocated for the reservations. In General George Crook's autobiography, he notes that for Dr. Bendell 'it was generally understood that during his short stay in Arizona he carried off $50,000 for his share of the spoils' (pp. 183‚Äì184). No evidence was presented to support the allegation. While in Arizona Dr. Bendell invested in a mine and resigned from his position on March 26, 1873. =Physician in Albany, NY= After resigning from the superintendent position, Dr. Bendell received a consular appointment to Elsinore, Denmark. He sailed with his new wife in late 1873 to Denmark for the very brief posting. After his posting in Denmark, Dr. Bendell spent a year studying ophthalmology under the noted professor Otto Heinrich Enoch Becker in Heidelberg, Germany. He then returned to Albany, NY where he enjoyed a prominent medical career and civic activity for the rest of his life. He was president of the Board of Public Instruction from 1881 to 1882. As President of the New York State Medical Society, Dr. Bendell delivered the anniversary address in the state senate chamber in February 1894 on the topic \\"The Physician of Sacred History\\". In 1913 Dr. Bendell cared for the wife of New York State impeached governor William Sulzer. Family and Death On September 16, 1873 Dr. Bendell married Wilhelmine Lewi, the daughter of Dr. Joseph Lewi. The marriage took place in Albany and was conducted by the reform Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise.

He co-founded the GALA Hispanic Theatre in Washington D.C. with his wife Rebecca Read Medrano. The GALA Hispanic Theatre features Spanish and Latin American plays and has staged over 220 productions since its founding in 1976. Hugo Medrano serves as the theatre's Founding Producing Artistic Director. Along with directing Latino theatre, Medrano is an accomplished actor. He received the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor for his role as Molina in El Beso de la Mujer Arana in 1994. Medrano's work with the Gala Hispanic Theatre has earned international acclaim. For his dedication to promoting Spanish culture in the United States, Medrano was bestowed the Order of Queen Isabella by Carlos I, former King of Spain.  Early life and education  Hugo Medrano lived in Argentina for much of his early life. He attended Escuela de Teatro de La Plata and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Theatre. Shortly after graduation, Medrano fled political violence as a result of Argentina's Dirty War which targeted left-wing political dissidents. He reported that many of his friends were some of the students, intellectuals, and artists who disappeared as a result of the war. These experiences inspired the political themes of Medrano's early work. Medrano continued his studies in Spain at the Teatro Estudio de Madrid. He lived and performed in Spain for five years before immigrating to the United States.  Career  Hugo Medrano's career in the United States began at Teatro Doble, a bilingual children's theatre located in Washington D.C. However, most of his notable work was done with the GALA Hispanic Theatre. GALA stands for Grupo de Artistas Latino Americanos. Hugo Medrano co-founded this theatre in 1976 to deliver quality plays to the growing Spanish-speaking community of Washington. In its early years, the GALA Hispanic Theatre performed in a townhouse in the multicultural Adams Morgan neighborhood of the city. Hugo Medrano produced and directed the group's first production, La Fiaca by Ricardo Talesnik, which received recognition by the Washington Post. Medrano would go on to direct, produce, and act in a multitude of successful productions over the next 40 years. As a theatre director at GALA, Hugo Medrano faced challenges concerning the bilingual nature of his productions. To appeal to both Spanish-speaking and English-speaking audiences, Medrano would often present two different productions of the same play, an English version and a Spanish version. In some cases, this would require two different actors, costumes, or directors to perform these productions. Medrano found this approach to be inefficient, and the GALA Hispanic Theatre subsequently transitioned to producing plays in Spanish and providing English subtitles or headphone translations to the audience. Moving the GALA Hispanic Theatre to a permanent home in the Tivoli Theatre of Columbia Heights was an important moment in Hugo Medrano's career. The Tivoli Theatre was built in 1924 and quickly became a city landmark as both a theatre and a cinema. The theatre was abandoned in 1976 but was restored with the help of a $4 million fundraising campaign started by Hugo Medrano and others. In 2005, the GALA Hispanic Theatre officially moved into the Tivoli Theatre and Medrano began to work on new projects. With the help of his wife, Hugo Medrano created the National Center for Latino Performing Arts and has expanded GALA's focus to include concerts, dance, film, and other arts.  Notable productions =In the Heights= In the Heights is a Tony Award winning broadway musical which featured music and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. In 2017, Hugo Medrano and the GALA Hispanic Theatre hosted the first all Spanish version of the production in the United States. The musical is usually performed in Spanglish, a mix of Spanish and English.  Awards  Hugo Medrano was recognized as a \\"Visionary\\" by the Mayor's Arts Awards in 2014. He also received an Immigrant Achievement Award from the American Immigration Council in 2014. In 2010, both Hugo Medrano and his wife Rebecca Read Medrano were named Washingtonians of the Year by the Washingtonian magazine.

Children who are placed out of the home differ in the types and severity of maltreatment experienced compared to children who remain in the home. One-half to two-thirds of youth have experienced a traumatic event leading to increased awareness and growing literature on the impact of trauma on youth. The most common reasons for out-of-home placements are due to physical or sexual abuse, violence, and neglect. Youth who are at risk in their own homes for abuse, neglect, or maltreatment, as well as youth with severe emotional and behavior issues, are placed out of the home with extended family and friends, foster care, or in residential facilities. Out- of-home placements aim to provide children with safety and stability. This temporary, safe environment allows youth to have their physical, mental, moral, and social needs met. However, these youth are in a vulnerable position for experiencing repeated abuse and neglect.  Out-of-home placements =Foster care= According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2011), there were 408,425 youth in the United States in foster care in 2010. Foster care is a division of child welfare services that places a child in an interim home when parents or guardians are unable or unwilling to adequately care for the child or when the child has experienced a trauma by the guardians or parents. Ninety percent of foster care youth are exposed to trauma with the most common type of maltreatment being neglect or abuse. Abuse and neglect effect each child differently and create different stress reactions, however, these maltreatment types often occur together. Girls are more likely to be victims of sexual or emotional abuse, while boys are at an increased risk to experience violence or environmental trauma. While foster care placements are intended to be temporary, multiple placements often occur because of a child's multifaceted needs. For instance, in 2008, the average amount of time a child was in foster care was 15.3 months with an average of 3.2 placements. Youth in foster care who experience complex trauma have a higher probability of experiencing post-traumatic stress and a mental health diagnosis. =Residential care= Residential care is defined as a 24-hour placement where adolescents live away from the home and receive a higher level of treatment from mental health professionals who provide multidisciplinary services such as therapy and medication management. Similar to youth in foster care, residentially bound youth are difficult to treat due to behavioral and emotional regulation difficulties. Residential care is typically reserved for adolescents who are considered to be a danger to the community and themselves, requiring a structured and safe environment. These facilities are not only highly restrictive but are also the most expensive psychological service available. While effective treatment continues to be debated due to cost and restrictiveness, residential facilities continue to offer promise for youth who were unsuccessful in community settings. Residential youth experience two to three times more family violence and physical or sexual abuse than the general population. The youth entering residential care have been exposed to at least one traumatic event, with an average of 5.8 events. Most of these individuals have also been removed from their home and have experienced at least one other out-of-home placement. Residential settings can intensify the trauma experienced because of the sudden, unexpected, and unfamiliar environment and nature of displacement. These settings are house youth that have experienced similar traumas, further putting the child at high risk for being triggered. The hopelessness of the new environment, seclusion, and restraint techniques utilized can also re-traumatize the youth. = Difference between foster care and residential youth = When comparing residential care to other out-of-home placements, youth tend to present with more negative symptoms. There is a positive association between how restricted a placement is and trauma symptoms. Youth in residential treatment have higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors compared to youth in foster care. Children in foster care have more positive views about the care received. Although, some residential youth tend to prefer residential placement over foster care due to feeling more tense and unable to relax in a foster home with the foster parents taking on the role of their parent. Children who have experienced both residential and foster care further thought that biological children received preferential treatment leaving foster children feeling alienated.  Impact on functioning  Impairments in emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functioning, along with deficits in development, mental health, and attachment behaviors are associated with traumatic experiences and are noticeably more prevalent in foster care and residential youth as they experience high rates of abuse and neglect. = Mental health = The traumatic experiences that the youth are exposed to increases the risk of a mental health diagnosis, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. Further, increased exposure to traumatic experiences results in a heighten risk of symptoms within the clinical range of dissociation, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Out-of-home placements place youth at risk for increased conduct, attention, and hyperactivity problems. Early exposure to complex trauma elevates the risk of suicidality, legal problems, and incarceration in adolescents and young adults. These experiences often manifest as depression and PTSD in females and substance abuse in males. PTSD is associated with maltreatment, with sexual traumas being the most highly linked to PTSD. Youth in out-of-home placements experience PTSD at increased rates compared to youth in the general population. However, PTSD is not the most commonly diagnosed disorder in youth with exposure to trauma. Avoidance symptoms are less commonly displayed in younger children with PTSD and their memories of the traumatic event are demonstrated through play. These differences in symptom presentation can often lead to the misdiagnosis of PTSD. The prevalence rate for PTSD in youth placed in out-of-home-care is higher than youth who remained at home. = Cognitive impairments = A child's cognitive development is compromised by repeated abuse and neglect. Cognitive impairments suggest lower IQ, academic underachievement, as well as neurocognitive deficits. Other brain functions affected by maltreatment include motor development, attention, memory, executive functions, emotional regulation, and interpersonal relatedness. Biological changes in the central and autonomic nervous system also occur when the brain is constantly detecting and surviving threats, also known as survival mode. = Behavioral impairments = Both internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors are more likely with the experience of complex trauma. Aggressive behaviors, anger, conduct problems, and oppositional defiance are all associated with complex trauma. Outward aggressive behaviors are not necessarily intended to cause harm but are utilized as maladaptive attempts to cope or protect oneself from feelings of powerlessness, betrayal, and fears of abandonment. Youth exposed to trauma experience low self-esteem, high self-criticism, shame, difficulties in forming and maintaining interpersonal relationships, as well as academic struggles. Exposure to early traumatic experiences, such as abuse and neglect, can have an impact on the child's development and behavior, creating impairments in overall health, mental health, and overall functioning in adulthood. Adults that were exposed to traumatic events in childhood are at an increased risk for chronic disease, suicidality, and mortality. Specific experiences of maltreatment heighten the likelihood of PTSD, anxiety, mood, and substance disorders throughout the lifespan.  Specific trauma experiences in out-of-home placements  When a child is removed from their home at an early age, the child becomes more vulnerable, not only because of the new, unfamiliar setting, but also due to the nature of the removal and separation from a caregiver. The child's risk for developmental, mental, educational, and social issues also increases. Impairments in functioning may be heightened due to the loss of familiar surroundings and attachment disruption associated with out-of-home placements. The primary challenge with early complex trauma experiences is the youth's ambivalent attitude toward future relationships with authority, adults, and unfamiliar peers. Abuse and neglect from parental figures often lead to insecure and disorganized attachment behavior due to the parent being the one the child needs to engage while simultaneously viewing that individual as frightening. Regulating their emotions, therefore, becomes difficult for the child because of the lack of a secure attachment that typically fosters healthy expression and control of emotions. = Betrayal trauma = Betrayal trauma occurs when youth are exposed to traumatic events by parents, caregivers, or legal guardians and is processed differently than abuse, violence, and neglect. Youth that have experienced betrayal trauma can recover with unconditional support from a caregiver, where a new, nurtured worldview can be formed.

She is known for being the first Chinese-American woman to pass the bar admission of State Bar of California. She was also the first Chinese-American woman to be the chief executive of a bank. Chu served as mayor of Monterey Park, California in 2006, and held two elected terms on the city council between 2003 and 2012. She ran for the 32nd Congressional district as a Republican in May 2009, and lost to Judy Chu.  Early life and education  Chu was born in San Diego, California. Her father, Tom Kay Chu, owned a farm, and her mother, Yee Siu King, was an immigrant from Guangzhou. By age nine, Chu wanted to pursue a career in law as a working class advocate, after witnessing one of the migrant workers on her father's farm be beaten. After graduating from Grossmont High School, she earned a BS degree from University of Southern California. Chu earned a JD degree from University of Southern California.  Career  In June 1961, Chu was admitted to the State Bar of California. In 1961, Chu became the first Chinese-American woman lawyer in Southern California. As a pioneer in the legal field, Chu's career was supported by Hiram Kwan, founder of \\"Kwan, Quan, Cohen, and Lum\\", a law firm in Los Angeles Chinatown. In 1973, Chu was one of the founding members of East West Federal Bank (now East West Bancorp). Chu also co-founded Trust Saving Bank and served as its Chairperson and CEO; she was the first Chinese American woman to run a bank in the United States.(bank no longer active) She has taught classes at California College of Law and Los Angeles Community College. In 1992, Chu was a member of the Los Angeles Police Department's Police Chief selection committee. Chu was an elected city council member of Monterey Park, California from 2003-2007, and again 2009-2012. On March 13, 2006, Chu was sworn in as the mayor of Monterey Park. In May 2009, Chu campaigned for the 32nd Congressional district as a Republican, but she lost to Judy Chu, her cousin by marriage. On June 11, 2012, Chu abruptly resigned from the city council and stated this was due to \\"philosophical differences\\" with other council members. According to the Pasadena Star News, she stated in a speech to the council: \\"Some other council members don‚Äôt spend adequate time reviewing staff reports and supporting documents ‚Ä¶ and it is evident from frequent 4-1 votes on key vital issues that facts don‚Äôt really matter because there is a deep political and philosophical divide.\\" On June 5, 2014, the California State Senate passed the Senate Joint Resolution 23 and 122, which is associated to formally apology for past California anti-Chinese legislation.

In electrochemical reactions, when the cathode and the anode are close enough to each other (i.e., so-called \\"nanogap electrochemical cells\\"), the double layer regions from the two electrodes can be overlapped, forming large electric field uniformly distributed inside the entire electrode gap. Such high electric field can significantly enhance the ion migration inside bulk solution, and thus facilitate the entire reaction rate, performing like \\"breakdown\\" of the reactant(s). However, it is fundamentally different from the meaning of traditional \\"breakdown\\". Virtual breakdown mechanism is discovered in 2017 when researchers studied pure water electrolysis based on deep-sub-Debye-length nanogap electrochemical cells. Furthermore, researchers found the size effect of the gap distance between cathodes and anodes to the performance of electrochemical reactions.  Electric field distribution  Schematic diagram of potential distribution comparison between macrosystem and nanogap cells The fundamental difference between traditional cells and nanogap cells are their electric potential distribution. This is the premise of the \\"virtual breakdown\\" effect. For electrochemical reactions with high- concentration electrolyte in macrosystem, the Debye-length is quite small. Due to the screening effect, almost all the potential drop is confined within such small Debye-length region (or double layer region). The potential in bulk solution (far from the electrodes) would not change too much, meaning that there is nearly zero electric field inside the bulk solution. However, when we put the counter electrode within the Debye-length region (i.e., nanogap electrochemical cells), two double layers from anode and cathode have to be overlapped with each other. The electrostatic potential inside the entire gap can change continuously and dramatically, meaning that huge electric field can be uniformly distributed in the entire gap.  Pure water electrolysis  Take pure water electrolysis as an example to explain the concept of Virtual breakdown mechanism. = Pure water electrolysis in macrosystem = Pure water in macrosystem cannot be split efficiently due to the lack of rapid ions transport inside bulk solution. For water electrolysis, here use H3O+ ions and cathode as an example to explain the traditional reactions. Water molecules can be self-ionized to H3O+ and OH‚àí ions. Near the cathode surface (within double layer region), newly-generated H3O+ ions can become hydrogen gas after obtaining electrons from cathode ; However, because there is nearly no electric field inside bulk solution (see section \\"Electric field distribution\\"), such OH‚àí ions can only transport through bulk solution very slowly by diffusion step. Moreover, in pure water the intrinsic H3O+ concentration is only 10‚àí7 mol/L, not enough to neutralize the newly-generated OH‚àí ions. In this way, OH‚àí ions have to accumulate locally at the cathode surface (turning the solution near cathode into alkaline). Due to the Le Chatelier's principle, for water self-ionization, H3O+ + OH- <=> 2H2O the OH‚àí ions accumulation can impede water further self-ionization, reducing the hydrogen evolution rate and eventually preventing water electrolysis. In this case, water electrolysis becomes very slow or even self-stopped, showing a large equivalent resistance between the two electrodes. That is why in macrosystem pure water cannot be electrolyzed efficiently. The fundamental reason is the \\"lack of rapid ions transport inside bulk solution\\". = Pure water electrolysis in nanogap cell = In nanogap cell, high electric field in the entire gap can enhance water ionization and mass transport (mainly migration), leading to pure water splitting efficiently limited by electron- transfer. In nanogap cells, high electric field can distribute uniformly in the entire gap (see section \\"Electric field distribution\\"). Different from ion transport in macrosystem, now newly-generated OH‚àí ions can be immediately migrated from cathode to anode. In the case where the two electrodes are close enough, the mass transport rate can be even larger than the electron-transfer rate, resulting in such OH‚àí ions waiting for electron-transfer at the anode, rather than accumulated at the cathode. In this way, the entire reaction can keep going and no self-stopped. Notice that, for pure water electrolysis in nanogap cells, the net OH‚àí ion accumulation near the anode not only increases the local reactant concentration, but also decreases the overpotential requirement (as in the Frumkin effect). According to Butler‚ÄìVolmer equation, such ions accumulation can increase the electrolysis current, a.k.a., water splitting throughput and efficiency. The traditional view should be revised that even pure water can be efficiently electrolyzed, when the electrode gap is small enough. = Virtual breakdown mechanism = In reality, water molecules dissociation (splitting into H3O+ and OH‚àí ions) occurs only at the electrode region (because of the ions continuous consumed at the two electrodes); however, it appears like that the molecule split in the middle of the gap, with H3O+ ions migrating towards the cathode and OH‚àí ions migrating towards the anode, respectively. With the help of huge electric field in the gap (see section \\"Electric field distribution\\"), not only the transport rate increases, but also the water molecules ionization has been enhanced (i.e., local concentration has been enhanced). From a microscopic perspective, the total effect looks like breakdown of water molecules. However, this effect is not traditional breakdown, which in fact requires much larger electric field around 1 V/√Ö,. In the nanogap cells, the huge electric field is still not large enough to split water molecules directly. However, \\"it can take advantage of the self-ionization of water (splitting into H3O+ and OH‚àí ions, and those two types of ions are continuously consumed at the two electrodes), facilitating the equilibrium reaction to shift in the ionization direction\\" 2H2O -> H3O+ + OH- Such field-assisted ionization, with the fast ion transport (mainly migration), performs very similar to the breakdown of water molecules. That is why this field-assisted effect is named \\"virtual breakdown mechanism\\". Consider the equation of conductivity, \\\\sigma=nq\\\\mu Here the ion charges are not changed. The ion concentration is enhanced but only contributes to the conductivity partially. The fundamental change here is that \\"apparent mobility\\" has been significantly enhanced, as \\"breakdown\\" effect. (In traditional electrochemical cells, although the ion intrinsic mobility is high, since there is nearly zero electric field inside bulk solution, it cannot contribute to the conductivity.) Consider the equivalent resistance between the two electrodes, as given by R=\\\\rho{L \\\\over S} When we decrease the gap distance between the two electrodes, \\"not only the value of L decreases, but also the value of resistivity decreases as well, which in fact contributes more to the decrease of the total resistance\\". This \\"virtual breakdown mechanism\\" can be applied on almost all kinds of \\"weakly-ionized\\" materials, In fact, such weaker ionization can lead to larger Debye-length inside the solution. At the same size scale, it actually helps to achieve the virtual breakdown effect.  Gap size effect  Phase diagram of electrochemical performance vs. gap distance The phase diagram here shows how important of the electrode gap distance to the performance of electrochemical reactions. For traditional macrosystem where the electrode gap distance is much larger than the Debye-length, two half-reactions are decoupled and cannot feel each other. Normally the electrochemical current is limited by slow diffusion step. When gap distance has been reduced to around Debye-length, large electric field can form between the two electrodes (due to double layers from two electrodes overlapping with each other) to enhance the mass transport rate. In this region, the electrolysis current is very sensitive to the gap distance and the reactions are migration limited. When the gap distance is further reduced to deep-sub-Debye-length region, the mass transport can be enhanced further to the level even faster than electron-transfer step. In this region, even we shrink the gap distance further the current cannot be enlarged any more, meaning that the current has reached saturation. Here the two half-reactions are coupled together and the reactions are limited by electron-transfer steps. By just adjusting the gap distance, the fundamental performance of the electrochemical reactions can be significantly changed.

In early January 1925 the ship caught fire off New Jersey coast and eventually was abandoned and scuttled by the crew without a loss of life. Design and construction In 1907 Clyde Steamship Co. following an expansion of their business decided to increase the number of sailings between New York and southern ports of Charleston and Jacksonville to four per week. The majority of steamers operating on the route were of cargo type, and the company felt the need to order one new steamer to serve mainly as a passenger carrier between the ports. At the time of her construction Mohawk was the largest and finest ship ever built for the Clyde Line and was laid down at the William Cramp & Sons' Kensington Yard in Philadelphia (yard number 349) and launched on 28 July 1908, with Mrs. J.S. Raymond, wife of the treasurer and assistant general manager of Clyde Steamship Company, serving as the sponsor. The ship was primarily designed for passenger transportation and in addition to two decks, also had a hurricane or sun deck constructed on top. The vessel provided accommodations in single cabins or suites for 275 cabin and 60 steerage passengers, and had all the staterooms and saloons located on the upper decks. In addition, a caf√©, and a spacious dining hall with a capacity to seat 110 people simultaneously, and open 24 hours a day, were built. A lounge, a reading room, a musical room, and smoking rooms were also constructed to provide entertainment for the would be passengers. Mohawk had electric lights in cabins and along the decks, and was also equipped with wireless of Marconi type. The vessel had also all the modern machinery fitted for quick loading and unloading of the cargo, including a large number of derricks. Following an inspection and the successful completion of sea trials, the steamer was transferred to her owners and departed for New York on November 4. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a depth of . Mohawk was assessed at and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 336 nhp triple- expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history Upon delivery Mohawk sailed from Philadelphia for New York on November 4, 1908. After taking on board a full complement of passengers, she departed on her maiden voyage on November 7 for Charleston and Jacksonville. The ship departed Jacksonville for her return trip on November 12, and arrived at New York on November 15, thus ending her maiden voyage. Mohawk continued serving the same route for the rest of her career, connecting Charleston and Jacksonville with Boston and New York, with occasional stops at Brunswick. The steamer carried a variety of general cargo from the southern ports, mostly lumber, cotton, naval stores, vegetables and fruit. On December 3, 1909 Mohawk ran aground in St. John's River just outside Jacksonville. She was soon refloated with the help of tugs and were able to continue her journey. The steamer came to the rescue of other vessels in distress on more than one occasion. In December 1909 Mohawk and Mallory Line steamer San Marcos rushed to the aid of another Clyde Line steamship Iroquois who lost her rudder in a gale off the Frying Pan Shoals. Mohawk stood by until two sea going tugs arrived and took the disabled steamer in tow. On January 15, 1910 while anchored at the entrance to St. John's River, the steamer's crew witnessed steamship Chatham striking a jetty and opening a hole in her bow. Mohawk sent a C.Q.D. signal informing the city of the accident and then went by the sinking ship to take aboard all of her crew, passengers and their baggage and then safely landing them at Jacksonville. On August 30, 1911 the steamer rescued the ten men crew of the schooner Malcolm B. Seavey which ran aground on a sandbar off Cape Romain and eventually sank in of water on August 27 during Charleston-Savannah hurricane. The steamer again rushed to help on February 15, 1916 when she stumbled upon a rowboat carrying four crewmen of two lumber carrying barges that got separated from their tug in a gale off Cape Hatteras two days earlier and safely brought them to New York. In November 1910 Mohawk made history by hiring the first female shipboard wireless operator. 22-year-old Miss Graynella Packer of Jacksonville, who was manager of the telegraph station in Sanford prior to her hiring, was employed as a wireless operator for the United Wireless Telegraph Company aboard the steamship from November 1910 to April 1911. In June 1911 Mohawk was borrowed by Mallory Line to carry a group of 226 Shriners of Texas who chartered the vessel to transport them to New York and from there by rail to Rochester to participate in the Shriner's Supreme Council. The vessel departed Galveston on July 2 and after calling at Havana on July 5 arrived at New York on July 8. Following that trip Mohawk transported a large group of Mallory-Clyde agents and officials from the southern states to New York to participate in the conference being held there. On November 12, 1914 Mohawks deck turned into a murder scene as George Batchelor Perkins, a well-known interior decorator and designer from Boston, and M.I.T. graduate, shot and killed F.W.R. Hinman, a business manager for The Florida Times-Union, and wounded captain Andrew D. Ingram of Mohawk and another passenger before being overpowered by stewards and other passengers. Perkins apparently suffered from sleeplessness and appeared to be acting in a dazzled state possibly due to taking several doses of prescribed opiate medication prior to the incident. In September 1916 it was reported that Mohawk was scheduled to go into drydock in New York to convert her into an oil burning vessel. The conversion work took nearly two months and the steamer returned to service in early November of the same year. In October 1917 following United States entry into World War I, Mohawk together with many other vessels over 2,500 tons capacity was requisitioned by the US Government. Mohawk would continue sailing on her usual route while under the government control, occasionally transporting military personnel. On June 1, 1918 Mohawk, after passing by two derelict vessels, encountered abandoned fully rigged schooner Edna. Edna was apparently intercepted by a German submarine , who forced her crew to abandon the ship and fired a few shots at her in hopes the schooner would sink or explode as she was laden with gasoline and oil. As the schooner appeared not to have any issues with buoyancy, Mohawk took the sailing vessel in tow bringing her safely into Delaware Breakwater. After the end of hostilities Mohawk returned to her normal obligations and continued serving the New York to Florida route for the rest of her career. On March 14, 1920 the steamer while on her way to Jacksonville with 214 passengers and 41 crew, blew her engine while 24 miles southwest of Cape Lookout. Several vessels heard her distress calls and a collier and the Coast Guard cutter rushed to her aid. While the steamer was able to temporarily repair her engines, and even slowly proceed under her own power, she was taken in tow by Manning and brought into Hampton Roads for repairs on March 17. After completion of repairs Mohawk was temporarily assigned to the New York & Porto Rico Steamship Co. to carry passengers and mails from New York to various West Indies ports including San Juan and Mayag√ºez in Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo and St. Thomas, and sugar on her return trips. In this service she carried the Governor-elect of Massachusetts, Channing H. Cox, his spouse and the state military and civil officials to Puerto Rico on November 6, 1920 to attend unveiling of the commemorative plaque in honor of 6th Massachusetts Regiment. The steamer transported the delegation back to New York after conclusion of the ceremonies and a short vacation. Shortly before Easter 1921 Mohawk was reassigned back to her usual East Coast route where she remained for the rest of her career. =Sinking= Mohawk left New York for her usual voyage to Florida at approximately 13:30 on January 1, 1925. She was under command of captain John N. Staples and was carrying 208 passengers (212 according to manifest) and 82 crew members, general cargo and 68 automobiles. The steamer ran into a strong nor'easter of New Jersey coast and was forced to slow down. At around 23:00 fire was discovered in the afterhold and the crew commenced fighting it by closing the hatches and pumping in water. After initial attempts to quickly extinguish fire failed, a distress call was sent at 23:45 and picked by the Henlopen Radio Compass Station. The Coast Guard stations at Cape May and Lewes were immediately informed and cutter was dispatched from Cape May to assist the distressed liner. As the storm continued raging, captain Staples decided to seek refuge in the Delaware Bay where he hoped to disembark passengers in much calmer waters. At approximately midnight passengers were informed of the situation and were told to gather on the upper deck. The distress signal was also picked by Merchants' and Miners' Steamship Co. steamer Persian whose captain being a certified Delaware Bay pilot offered to escort Mohawk. The steamer passed the breakwater at about 03:30 on January 2 and continued further north to the Brandywine Light, about twelve miles north of the breakwater where anchors were dropped. By 04:00 cutter Kickapoo arrived at the scene and continued to stand by waiting for the onset of daybreak. By 06:20 the fire spread out to the after salon and it was decided to evacuate the passengers. In addition to Kickapoo, two tugs, Kaleen and Mars, also arrived to assist the vessel. All passengers were transferred to the cutter and tugs and safely landed in Lewes at 12:40 on January 2 and then boarded a special train arranged for by the Clyde Line to take them to their destinations. In the meantime, the fire continued spreading and the crew fought it until about 09:00 when it became clear it could not be contained and the captain ordered to scuttle the ship. The fire continued raging and the ship burnt all the way down to water edge, and was subsequently abandoned by her owners to the underwriters. The ship floated for a while in the storm and eventually ran aground on the Lower Middle Shoal, about three miles west-southwest of the Fourteen-Mile lightship and roughly fifteen mile north of the position where the steamer was abandoned. The wreck laid in approximately nine feet of water, and was inspected on January 9 by the Clyde Line representative and it appeared the whole interior of the vessel had burnt down including her machinery. Curiously, of all the cargo aboard the steamer, a lone automobile survived the fire that raged for many hours almost completely unaffected. Some time during the week of January 25, 1925 the wreck of Mohawk broke in two and the stern disappeared under water.

History In March 1965 when United States Marine Corps combat troops landed at Danang, the support establishment was rudimentary. The port of Danang contained only three small piers, three Landing Ship, Tank (LST) ramps and a stone quay that were inaccessible to oceangoing vessels; even smaller craft had trouble approaching. The scarcity of lighterage and the heavy weather that often buffeted the harbor made ship-to-craft cargo transfers hazardous and inefficient. Warehouses, open storage areas, cargo handling equipment, and good exit routes from the port were limited. From March to July 1965, III Marine Amphibious Force troops delivered supplies to the units in the field while the Seventh Fleet ran port operations. Soon, the fleet dispatched Naval Beach Group 1, Cargo Handling Battalions 1 and 2, nucleus port crew, Mine Force, Service Force, underwater demolition team, and explosive ordnance disposal units to Danang. In addition, the Navy took charge of the offloading, storage and delivery of supplies common to all the allied forces in I Corps. Additional responsibilities included harbor defense and the transshipment of cargo to the smaller ports in the region. The fleet also managed logistic operations at these locations. U.S. Naval Support Activity (NSA) Danang was officially established on 15 October 1965 under the operational control of Commander, III Marine Amphibious Force. During the next several years, the command created subordinate naval support activity detachments at Chu Lai, Hu·∫ø, T√¢n M·ªπ, ƒê√¥ng H√†, C·ª≠a Vi·ªát, Phu Bai and Sa Hu·ª≥nh. These detachments decentralized the support function and improved the logistic flow. During 1965 the logistic operation at Danang suffered from lack of suitable or sufficient harbor craft, cargo handling equipment, and port personnel. Management and planning of the logistic flow needed refinement, as ships arrived en masse with cargo improperly stowed and packaged. Storage areas ashore were limited by space and access. Finally, the harsh northeast monsoon made cargo operations at Danang and throughout I Corps hazardous and difficult during the winter months. In November 1965 500 men moved into the old French Army camp, Camp Tien Sha at the foot of Monkey Mountain. The camp was quickly expanded to include 25 new barracks able to accommodate an additional 1700 men, together with a barber shop, post exchange and milk plant. NSA Danang originally operated from a commercial pier on the city side of the H√†n River and this \\"Museum Ramp\\" () near the Cham Museum began operation in November 1965 off- loading LCU's and LST's. In July 1966 the \\"Bridge Cargo Ramp\\" () began operations increasing NSA's supply capability. In August 1967, the headquarters of NSA Danang was moved from downtown Danang to Camp Tien Sha. Tien Sha Ramp, February 1969 Logistic vessels under the control of NSA Danang included Landing Craft Mechanized (LCM 3 & LCM 6) and LCU landing craft; harbor utility craft (YFU); small harbor tugs (YTL); open lighters (YC); refrigerated barges (YFRN); Army craft; and a refrigerator ship. While base facilities were under construction, the fleet deployed to Danang LSTs, a Landing Ship Dock (LSD) and an Attack Transport (APA), the latter for quartering and messing NSA personnel. The harbor defense unit used landing craft, picket boats and Boston Whalers to monitor and protect the maritime traffic. A small craft repair facility and an Auxiliary floating drydock (AFDL) helped keep NSA vessels in working order. Over 130 rough terrain and warehouse forklifts and 20 cranes eased cargo handling. The logistic establishment at Danang functioned with growing efficiency by mid-1968 as it built new port and shore facilities. Seabees, initially using materials pre- stocked before the war in Advanced Base Functional Component packages, constructed three deep-draft piers for oceangoing ships, two wooden piers an LST causeway and the Bridge Cargo Complex that consisted of a long wharf, 300,000 cubic feet of refrigerated storage space and 500,000 square feet of covered storage space. Amphibious fuel lines were laid along the sea floor to storage tanks ashore at Red Beach Base Area, north of the city and the Marines' Marble Mountain Air Facility to the south. By July 1968 NSA Danang handled 350,000 tons of cargo each month for the 200,000 allied troops in I Corps. Danang had become the largest fuel complex in South Vietnam capable of holding over 500,000 barrels. The station hospital begun in 1965 had treated over 21,000 casualties, 44,000 nonbattle patients and one million outpatients flowing in from the hostile and disease-ridden I Corps environment. In mid- October 1968 the Deep Water Pier complex () on the Tien Sha peninsula was completed, beginning operations in September 1968. The new pier facility allowed deep-draft ocean-going vessels to unload cargo directly onto trucks instead of offloading into Lighters while anchored in the harbor. By 1969 NSA Danang was the Navy's largest overseas shore command and third largest supply depot after Norfolk and Oakland Naval Supply Depot and Camp Tien Sha had grown to accommodate over 6000 personnel. In April 1972 all US Navy facilities in Danang were transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Navy.

He was the first Director of the Vaudoise Cantonal School of Design and the first Conservator of what is now known as the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts in Lausanne.  Biography  He originally attended school in Orbe, then in Yverdon. His initial artistic training came from his cousins, the miniaturists and J√©r√©mie Arlaud (1758-1827) in Geneva. In 1797, he went to Paris where he worked in the studios of another miniaturist, Antoine Louis Romanet (c. 1742-1810), until he could begin studies with Jacques-Louis David in 1799. He and his father both became citizens (bourgeoisie) of Orbe in 1802. In 1811, he was expelled from France for a \\"d√©lit d'opinion\\" (offensive opinion) concerning the conduct of Napoleon and his government. He returned to Lausanne and opened a workshop where he taught drawing. In 1821, the Grand Council of Vaud adopted a decree that would establish an official drawing school. The following year, the Academy of Lausanne held a competition to select the first Director and chose Arlaud. He retained that position until his death. Hoping to establish a fine arts museum, he donated 34,000 Francs to the city for that purpose. In exchange, he requested a lifelong pension and his offer was accepted in 1834. The museum was designed by Louis Wenger and inaugurated in 1841.L'espace Arlaud, ville de Lausanne Arlaud was named to be the Curator/Conservator and held that position until 1844. During his tenure, he built the museum's collection, which included a large donation of paintings from the family of Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros and many works by contemporary artists. Near the end of 1844, he became bedridden due to illness and died in Spring the following year. He left 2,500 Francs to the government of Vaud to commission a painting from Charles Gleyre, a local painter who was then living in Paris. The painting, which depicted the local hero, Abraham Davel, on the scaffold was completed in 1850. It was destroyed by fire during an act of vandalism in 1980. In 1904, the works from the Mus√©e Arlaud were transferred to the Palais de Rumine. The portion housing the collection is now known as the Cantonal Museum of Fine Arts. .

It has an average total length of 7.9 cm, but can reach a total length of 15 cm. They have many tiny dots across their body, most obvious under the head and belly. The anal fin‚Äîthe fin found under the body of the fish‚Äîis long and has 21 to 27 rays, reaching the caudal‚Äîor tail‚Äîfin. The caudal fin is usually straight or barely rounded. Like other madtoms, black madtoms possess many chemically sensitive sensory pores and barbels.  Distribution and habitat  These fish can commonly be found from gulf slope drainages from Econfina Creek, Florida, to the Pearl River in Louisiana and Mississippi. Black madtoms prefer permanent springs and creeks or rivers with a moderate or fast flow. They prefer a habitat with a small gravel or coarse sand bed, and prefer the cover of vegetation. It is presumed that eggs are laid under rocks.  Diet  The black madtom is believed to have a similar diet to those of other madtom, consisting of decapods and the larvae of flies, mayflies, and caddisflies. Plant material makes up a greater percent of the diet in summer.  Behavior  The black madtom have been noted to be nocturnal.

Working with a tasteful, George Shearing Quintet-like rhythm section, Newman benefits from arrangements and colors that give the album classiness beyond a blowing session\\".Cordle, O. JazzTimes Review accessed November 19, 2018 On All About Jazz, Terrell Kent Holmes observed: \\"Even after decades in the music business, it's clear that David \\"Fathead Newman still has many, many notes left to play. Toward that end Life is a handful of chestnuts on which he displays his formidable triple-threat skills on tenor sax, alto sax and flute ...

Sighting  During a Fouga Magister jet training mission at Pori Airport on April 12, 1969, a Finnish Defence Forces flight controller told pilot-in-training Tarmo Tukeva to investigate seven air balloons that were floating at approximately 1500-3000 meters above the airport. Tukeva reported that the objects were ball or disc shaped, but could not determine his distance to them. According to Tukeva, the objects accelerated away from him ‚Äúat great speed‚Äù. Undetermined radar images were also later reported 200 kilometers away in Vaasa. A second pilot-in-training, Jouko Kuronen, says he overheard the radio communications between the flight controller and Tukeva as well as observing the objects. According to the Finnish Armed Forces magazine Ruotuv√§ki, the April 12 reports were similar to other cases occurring over bodies of water during ongoing military exercises, and may have been due to \\"transnational spy planes or aircraft\\".

They are named in honour of Russian mathematician Maks A. Akivis. Formally, if A is a vector space over a field \\\\mathbb{F} of characteristic zero, we say A is an Akivis algebra if the operation \\\\left(x,y\\\\right)\\\\mapsto\\\\left[x,y\\\\right] is bilinear and anticommutative; and the trilinear operator \\\\left(x,y,z\\\\right)\\\\mapsto\\\\left[x,y,z\\\\right] satisfies the Akivis identity: : \\\\left[\\\\left[x,y\\\\right],z\\\\right]+ \\\\left[\\\\left[y,z\\\\right],x\\\\right]+ \\\\left[\\\\left[z,x\\\\right],y\\\\right]= \\\\left[x,y,z\\\\right]+ \\\\left[y,z,x\\\\right]+ \\\\left[z,x,y\\\\right]- \\\\left[x,z,y\\\\right]- \\\\left[y,x,z\\\\right]- \\\\left[z,y,x\\\\right]. An Akivis algebra with \\\\left[x,y,z\\\\right]=0 is a Lie algebra, for the Akivis identity reduces to the Jacobi identity. Note that the terms on the right hand side have positive sign for even permutations and negative sign for odd permutations of x,y,z. Any algebra (even if nonassociative) is an Akivis algebra if we define \\\\left[x,y\\\\right]=xy-yx and \\\\left[x,y,z\\\\right]=(xy)z-x(yz). It is known that all Akivis algebras may be represented as a subalgebra of a (possibly nonassociative) algebra in this way (for associative algebras, the associator is identically zero, and the Akivis identity reduces to the Jacobi identity).
