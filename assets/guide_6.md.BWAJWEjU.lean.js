It was discovered on 18 November 1998, by astronomers with the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the ETS Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico. The dark Jovian asteroid belongs to the 80 largest Jupiter trojans and has a notably slow rotation of 78.9 hours. It was named after Iphthime from Greek mythology. The discovery of its companion by Hubble Space Telescope was announced in March 2016.  Orbit and classification  Iphthime is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60¬∞ ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8‚Äì5.6 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,319 days; semi-major axis of 5.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 15¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as ' at Crimea- Nauchnij in November 1974, or 24 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Iphthime, sister of Penelope and daughter of Icarius. Iphthime appears in her sister's dream to comfort her as she is grieving. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 3 December 2017 ().  Physical characteristics  Iphthime is an assumed C-type asteroid. Its V‚ÄìI color index of 0.96 is typical for D-type asteroids, the most common spectral type among the larger Jupiter trojans. = Rotation period = Iphthime and its companion imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2018 In October 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Iphthime was obtained for the first time by Stefano Mottola from photometric observations during seven nights at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain. Lightcurve analysis gave a long rotation period of hours or 3.3 days with a brightness amplitude of 0.25 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Iphthime measures between 55.43 and 57.341 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.065 and 0.069.

It is a thriller set in the aftermath of the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis, focusing on the efforts of the protagonist, Arnar Finnsson, to complete the last book and, eventually, solve the murder of his dead partner Hulda. Form Samhengi hlutanna is a first- person crime thriller, written in the voice of Arnar Finnsson, an Icelander who has abandoned a career as a lawyer to move to London and become an artist and illustrator. A large proportion of the book is direct speech, as the main characters work their way from one informant to another, and process the information they receive in conversations between themselves. To a large extent their interviews form a series of set-piece case studies of different sections of Iceland's boom-time business community, each reflecting on the Crash from their own perspective. It has been suggested that Sigr√∫n's writing is strongest when portraying Arnar's inner life and the colourful characters he encounters, but becomes rather stilted when dealing with financial detail.Arnar Eggert Thoroddsen, 'Hi√∞ galna √çsland', Sunnudags Moggin (27 November 2011), p. 45. Rather than being divided into chapters as such, the narrative is simply punctuated by headings stating the date whenever a new day begins (in the abbreviated format '2.4. (f√∂.)' (i.e. '2 April (f√∂studagur [Friday])'). Whenever the city where the action takes place shifts between London and Reykjav√≠k, the setting is announced on an otherwise blank page. As J√≥n Karl Helgason has pointed out, much of the novel corresponds closely with real life: thus it features HK banki, Eyjabanki and Sleipnir, which seem straightforwardly to be ciphers for KB banki, Landsbanki and Glitnir, and the investment funds Hringur and Delilah, recalling Baugur Group and Samson holdings. The book invites interpretation, then, as a roman √† clef.J√≥n Karl Helgason, \`Samhengi hlutanna', in Hruni√∞, √æi√∞ muni√∞: Gagnabanki um samt√≠mas√∂gu, ed. by Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson, J√≥n Karl Helgason, and Mark√∫s √û√≥rhallsson (Reykjav√≠k: H√°sk√≥li √çslands, 2014--). Indeed, commentators have noted that, as a female Icelandic journalist in London investigating the Crash, Hulda can be seen as a cipher for Sigr√∫n herself.Arnar Eggert Thoroddsen, 'Hi√∞ galna √çsland', Sunnudags Moggin (27 November 2011), p. 45.Kristjana Gu√∞brandsd√≥ttir, 'Ma√∞ur minn, hva√∞ ma√∞ur var einfaldur √° s√°linni', DV (25 November 2011). In the analysis of J√≥n Karl Helgason, 'as a thriller, the narrative gets going rather slowly, but for those who have an interest in and a general acquaintance with developments in Icelandic business life in recent years, on the other hand, it is intriguing to note how closely the author sticks to reality in her writing'.'Sem spennusaga fer fr√°s√∂gnin fremur h√¶gt af sta√∞ en fyrir √æ√° sem hafa √°huga og almenna √æekkingu √° sviptingum √≠ √≠slensku vi√∞skiptal√≠fi √° undanf√∂rnum √°rum vegur √° m√≥ti kitlandi forvitni um hve n√¶rri veruleikanum h√∂fundurinn fer √≠ skrifum s√≠num'; J√≥n Karl Helgason, \`Samhengi hlutanna', in Hruni√∞, √æi√∞ muni√∞: Gagnabanki um samt√≠mas√∂gu, ed. by Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson, J√≥n Karl Helgason, and Mark√∫s √û√≥rhallsson (Reykjav√≠k: H√°sk√≥li √çslands, 2014--). Sigr√∫n can be understood as working to make the financial complexities of the Icelandic Crash accessible to a wider audience unlikely to read the lengthy official report, while also using novellistic form to explore the possibility of financial crime that her investigative journalism led her to suspect but that could not be proven. Finally, the novel allows her to inhabit the voices and views of different people on the Crash.J√≥n Karl Helgason, \`Samhengi hlutanna', in Hruni√∞, √æi√∞ muni√∞: Gagnabanki um samt√≠mas√∂gu, ed. by Gu√∞ni Th. J√≥hannesson, J√≥n Karl Helgason, and Mark√∫s √û√≥rhallsson (Reykjav√≠k: H√°sk√≥li √çslands, 2014--). The same perspectives have been suggested by Sigr√∫n's own commentary on writing the novel,Mitzi M. Brunsdale, Encyclopedia of Nordic Crime Fiction: Works and Authors of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden since 1967 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2016), pp. 213-14. though she has emphasised the fictionality of the work,Kristjana Gu√∞brandsd√≥ttir, 'Ma√∞ur minn, hva√∞ ma√∞ur var einfaldur √° s√°linni', DV (25 November 2011). and that evidence of money laundering in the Icelandic banks has not come to light, with the relevant suspicious behaviour being attributable to 'abysmally bad management'.Sigr√∫n Dav√≠√∞sd√≥ttir, ‚ÄòIceland, Russia and Bayrock: Some Facts, Less Fiction‚Äô, Icelog (30 May 2017). Summary On 14 December 2009, Arnar's partner Hulda, a journalist, is killed in what is at first thought to be a road accident, while writing an investigative book about shady dealings behind the 2008 Icelandic financial crisis. Arnar falls into depression. On 21 March 2010, however, an old friend of Hulda's, the reformed alcoholic Raggi, visits Arnar, insisting that together they complete Hulda's book. They swiftly follow Hulda's leads, abetted by tip-offs from a sinister Russian called Dmitri, to one √ìttar Hafsteinsson. As the novel goes on, it emerges that √ìttar was involved in establishing a factory in post-Soviet Saint Petersburg, before becoming an investor in the Bulgarian telecoms sector, backed by a German bank. Soon too, Arnar and Raggi team up with Mara, a beautiful Hong Kong-Finnish specialist in financial crime, with whom Raggi begins a relationship. Their explorations involve a number of British contacts and tagging along on the drug-fuelled binge of a Latvia-based Icelandic entrepreneur called √ìli √ñrvar Magn√∫sson. They have a long discussion with a lawyer called Wallinger, by which time Arnar is aware that he is being followed. Wallinger resigned from HK banki's operation in Luxembourg and fears to speak to the authorities due to a mixture of threats and fear of the opprobrium of other lawyers in the sector. 'Svo HK banki leit √∫t eins og risast√≥r peninga√ævottav√©l?' ('so HK Bank looked like a giant money-launderer?') asks Raggi. 'Ekki bara HK banki ... Allt √çsland' ('not just HK Bank ... the whole of Iceland'), Wallinger replies (p. 141). Wallinger points the team towards a Luxembourg company called BRAK. Arnar returns home to find a dead pitbull terrier hung up in his flat, a clear sign that he is being threatened by someone. Mara later links this method of intimidation with Latvian criminal gangs. Arnar and Raggi proceed to talk with √Årni Mar√≠n√≥sson, a lawyer who worked for √ìttar in the boom years, who defends √ìttar's practices as the everyday life of a businessman. The heroes start to get a feel for the possibility that the Icelandic banks' activities extended beyond imprudent and immoral practice to bribery and money-laundering. On 7 April, Arnar travels to Iceland to talk to his brother Rafn, a high-powered lawyer, and other acquaintances, to try to understand better what was going on during Iceland's boom. Rafn is a case-study of a patriotic Icelander who is bullish about Iceland's prospects. Arnar meets his ex-wife √ûorbj√∂rg at a birthday party; she and her husband worked for HK banki during the boom, and she is now unemployed while her husbands awaits impending prosecution. Arnar realises his brother is involved in helping the business associates Einar √ûorsteinn, his father J√≥n, and one Vigf√∫s, all closely tied to the Icelandic bank Sleipnir, to get ‚Ç¨600,000 in cash out of Iceland. Arnar manages to install spyware on his brother's office computer. He receives a package from an anonymous informant containing lists of Luxembourg-connected companies with names featuring 'Br√°k' ('debris, oil slick'). Early in Arnar's trip, √Årni Mar√≠n√≥sson phones from Panama, promising to meet Arnar in Iceland with new information, but is reported lost at sea in Panama on 11 April. However, on 13 April, √Årni's sister contacts Arnar to say she has received a package for him from √Årni. It contains details regarding the network of Br√°k-companies, their legal ownership, and transactions. 'Br√°k er interessant af √æv√≠ a√∞ √æeir sem stj√∂rna Br√°k eru √æeir sem √≠ alv√∂runni r√°√∞a √° √çslandi' ('Br√°k is interesting because the men who run Br√°k are the men who are really in charge in Iceland'), writes √Årni (p. 297). While in Iceland, Arnar is followed by a man who turns out to be a Latvian criminal called (inter alia) Juris Kalnis, and receives a threatening letter and phone call, the latter of which implies that Hulda was murdered. Meanwhile, Dmitri and other sources suggest that some Russians lost badly in the Crash because HK banki was holding bonds on their behalf. Before returning home on 21 April, Arnar and √ûorbj√∂rg visit the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull. Back in London, the team conclude that Br√°k companies are buying at overvalued prices and/or selling at undervalued ones, and conclude that the network is a vehicle for illicit payments. Rafn comes to London on business and helps them establish that Vigf√∫s, Eninar √ûorsteinn, J√≥n, and √ìli √ñrvar are all near the centre of Br√°k, and that √ìli √ñrvar helped √ìttar Hafsteinsson set up his business in Russia. Rafn's job in London is to deliver the ‚Ç¨600,000 and he realises that it is going into the hands of Juris Kalnis (the Latvian criminal who has been following Arnar), S√¶var Bjarni Halld√≥rsson (an Icelander who is based in Latvia) and Peteris Ozolins. Rafn returns home and it dawns on the team that Hulda did not die accidentally but was murdered, with the ‚Ç¨600,000 being payment for her assassination. The murder was probably prompted by her publication of an article about the Russian bonds in HK banki. Arnar and Raggi return to the scene of Hulda's murder and find a sweatshop on the street, where one of the workers gives them information about the killing. Mara directs them to a private investigator, Xavier, who helps them assemble their evidence to convince Scotland Yard to reopen the case. One of Mara's police friends tips off the team that the murderers are coming to the UK to collect their payment and on 28 April they accost S√¶var, Mara interrogates him, and they pass the evidence he provides to the police. On 29 April, the team learns that the police have arrested the killers, but on the same day Arnar learns that his brother Rafn has died in a car accident. Returning to Iceland, he receives a suicide note left by Rafn, which he burns. The final details of the relationship between the Latvian circle, Br√°k, and the Russian circle are left unresolved in the novel. External links * English translation of opening chapters.

After protracted development, the missile, similar in design to the French SS.10, was cancelled in favor of purchasing the SS.11 missile. Design and development The initial requirement for a guided anti- tank missile, intended for the replacement of recoilless rifles and Bazookas in the role,Ordway and Wakeford 1960, p.USA4 was issued by the U.S. Army in 1951; that November,Hunnicutt 1999, p.176. the Aerophysics Development Corporation responded with a proposal for a wire-guided weapon, similar in concept and configuration to the SS.10 missile being developed in France.Jacobs and Whitney 1962, p.44. After evaluating the SS.10 in 1952‚Äì53,Parsch 2003 the Army issued a contract for full development of the Aerophysics Development missile, designated SSM-A-23 Dart, in April 1953. The SSM-A-23 was of conventional configuration for an anti-tank missile of the time, having cruciform wings and stabilizing fins, with spoilerons providing control; a dual-thrust solid-propellant rocket produced by the Grand Central Rocket Company provided thrust. The launcher for the missile was mounted on a variant of the M59 armored personnel carrier designated T149;Hunnicutt 1999, p.78. helicopter launching was also considered as a possibility. Guidance was by manual command to line of sight, the missile operator following a sodium flare in the tail of the missile and guiding the missile to the target with commands sent by a wire that spooled from the missile during flight. Due to difficulties experienced in testing with ensuring accuracy, an infrared seeker was proposed for terminal homing. The missile was fitted with a shaped charge warhead intended to defeat the armor of enemy tanks. During development of the Dart, Aerophysics Development was acquired by the Studebaker-Packard Corporation,Bowman 1957, p.102. the purchase taking place in December 1954. Curtiss-Wright then acquired the company as part of a larger deal with Studebaker-Packard in August 1956.Friedman 1958, p. 20. Operational history The first launch trials of the XSSM-A-23 prototype missiles took place in August 1954; over the next year, forty additional tests took place. These proved less than satisfactory; by 1957, the Dart was still not ready for service, and it was believed that Aerophysics Development had overextended themselves with the technical challenges involved in the missile's development. Accordingly, the program was extended, with some of the Army's requirements being relaxed, however in September 1958 the program was determined to be too far behind schedule and too far over budget to be successful, and the contract for the Dart was cancelled. The Army adopted the SS.10, designated MGM-21, and the SS.11, designated AGM-22, in its stead. The program had cost $44 million in 1955 dollars.

Although he started out as a producer, Omid gradually moved into DJing, at the request of friends who asked him to play records at parties. He secured a regular spot playing the Elements club night run by Hooj Choons record label boss Red Jerry. In October 2001 Omid released The Witch/Which Equation under the alias of the Sixteen Million Dollar Man.

The dam, a 15-metre-high earth dam, was built by the Zweckverband Stausee Bitburg for flood protection at a spot where the narrow and deeply incised valley of the Pr√ºm opened into a valley bowl, that used to be constantly in danger of flooding. The roughly 2-kilometre-long and up to nine-metre-deep reservoir allows the regulation of low water levels, enables the generation of electricity, and offers a place of recreation, making it a popular destination and tourist centre in the South Eifel. Around the lake there is a five-kilometre-long circular path and many other good hiking trails, some of which are lit at night. The hiking network of the German-Luxembourg Nature Park starts here. Sporting and recreational activities include rowing, paddling, surfing, pedaloes, inline skating, mountain biking, badminton, cycling and fishing (for trout). in the middle of the lake is a large fountain.

It was formed in 1960 and soon became the 83rd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade () of the Soviet Air Defense Forces. The brigade provided air defense for the Leningrad area with S-75 Dvina and S-125 missiles. After reequipping with S-300PS missiles, the brigade was reorganized as the 1488th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1994.  History  Launching of an S-125 of the type used by the brigade The brigade was originally formed as the 83rd Air Defense Brigade of Special Designation, a unit of System-100, the Leningrad air defense missile system, in accordance with a General Staff directive dated 15 January 1958. It was the first brigade of the system to be formed and was based at Zelenogorsk-4. The brigade received its equipment between May and July of that year and became operational in its air defense sector in August 1959. It received its battle flag on 22 April 1959. In August 1960, it was redesignated the 83rd Anti- Aircraft Rocket Brigade. It included eight battalions of S-75 Dvina missiles, and was reinforced by six S-125 battalions transferred from the 169th Guards Anti-Aircraft Rocket Regiment in 1964, which had relocated from Vaskelovo to Kornevo and Uglovo to reequip with the S-200V. In 1967, the brigade was directly subordinated to the 6th Independent Air Defense Army when the air defense missile system was abolished as an independent headquarters. By a directive of 5 October of that year, the brigade inherited the Order of the Red Banner awarded to the 3rd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion of the 189th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment on 19 June 1943. The 189th provided air defense for Leningrad during the Siege of Leningrad in World War II, and cadres from it were used to form the brigade in the late 1950s. One of the S-75 battalions of the brigade was stationed at Lisy Nos in the Zhdanovsky District of Leningrad during the 1960s. In 1986, the brigade became part of the 54th Air Defense Corps. By the late 1980s, the 83rd included twelve missile battalions of S-75s and S-125s. In 1987, it began rearming with the new S-300PS in two groups of battalions. After the replacement of the S-75s and S-125s had been completed, the brigade was reorganized as the 1488th Anti- Aircraft Rocket Regiment in the summer of 1994. In 2009, the 54th Corps was converted into the 2nd Air Defense Brigade as part of the reform of the Russian Air Forces, and became part of the 1st Air and Air Defense Forces Command. The regiment became part of the 2nd Aerospace Defense Brigade in 2013 and the 2nd Red Banner Air Defense Division in 2014 when the brigade was reorganized. In 2015 the division became part of the 6th Air and Air Defense Forces Army when the latter was reformed. By 2016 the 1488th had been reequipped with new S-400 missiles.

Among its notable objects: Kurgan stelae, Kernosivkian idol and vast collection of cossack's antiquities.  History  = Public Museum = In February 1848 the Katerinoslav Public Museum was founded. It was established on the initiative of I. Grakhov, a principal of local gymnasium, and A. Fabr, a governor of Katerinoslav (modern Dnipro). Firstly, it was located in Potemkin Palace, that at the time belonged to the Province Gentry Assembly. During the Crimean War (1853 ‚Äì 1856) it was located inside the Katerinoslav Classical Male Gymnasium (modern Dnipro State Medical Academy's building on the October Square), which served as its permanent location until the beginning of XX century.–ë–µ–∫–µ—Ç–æ–≤–∞ –í. –ú. –Ø–∫—ñ–≤ –î–º–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä–∞—Ö–æ–≤ ‚Äî –¥—ñ—è—á –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∏ —Ç–∞ –æ—Å–≤—ñ—Ç–∏ –≤ –ö–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤—Å—å–∫—ñ–π –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω—ñ—ó // –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—è —ñ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—ñ–ø—Ä–æ–≤'—è (–∑–±—ñ—Ä–∫–∞ –Ω–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∞—Ü—å): –ó–±—ñ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫ –ø—Ä–∞—Ü—å / ‚Äî –ö–∏—ó–≤, 2009. ‚Äî –°. 22.

Fabr brought it there from Odessa Regional History Museum during the Crimean War (1853 ‚Äì 1856)). The first decade from the time of its establishment was the most prolific period in the museum's history.

Pol's museum was divided into seven divisions. Significant part of the display consisted of archaeological findings, which Pol discovered in Kurgans and burials within the Katerinoslav province.

Such a network model has first been proposed in 1999 to explain the network of links between web pages, but since has been used to model biological and citation networks as well.  Origins  In 1999 Jon Kleinberg and 3 co-authors published an article to Computing and combinatorics attempting to construct a network model that explains patterns found in an analysis of the world wide web. The intuition behind the model was that when a user decides to build and publish her own web page, she encounters a list of links for her topic of interest on the web and ends up copying this collection, or many such collections to her own web page. This creating a new node in the network - the new page - and copying edges from already existing nodes in some fashion. They outlined a model very generally, but didn't analyse the predictions of an exact model in detail, mostly due to computational limitations, but suggested that copying nodes randomly is a simple, model worthy mechanism for creating Zipfian distribution networks. . This paper since, has been cited over 1200 times, which is a number comparable to significant papers contributing to network science, like the one describing the Erd≈ës‚ÄìR√©nyi model (about 8300) and includes notable network science books like Mark Newman's.  Description  = General model = To understand a general model, take a basic network growth model, which is characterized by four stochastic processes. Creation processes C_v and C_e for node- and edge- creation, and deletion processes D_v and D_e for node- and edge-deletion. Take a discrete time timeframe, where C_v consists of simply at each step, creating a node with probability a_c(t), and similarly D_v is deleting a node with probability ad(t). Consequently, this also means D_e includes removing all edges that belonged to a node that was removed. C_e is where the essence of the copying model is. In the original article, they characterize C_e with a probability distribution, that determines a node v to add edges out of, and a number of edges k that will be added. And with probability beta that the k edges are either copied or added randomly. With probability beta, all k edges from v are drawn to nodes chosen independently and uniformly at random. With probability (1 - beta ), the k edges are copied from a randomly chosen node u. Meaning that k neighbours of u become neighbours of v. If u has a degree higher than k, k edges are selected randomly and if it has a lower degree l < k, a next node is randomly selected and k - l of its edges are copied, and so on. It can be shown, that such a network produces a power law degree distribution, with an exponent gamma = frac{2 - a}{1 - a} where a is the ratio of number of the randomly added edges to the number of the copied edges. . So with a ratio between zero and 0.5 a power law distribution with an exponent of 2 < gamma < 3 can be achieved. Also note that as the ratio approaches 1, the exponent goes to infinity. GNC model Another simple model, proposed to explain the observation that the average node degree grows with system size adds nodes one at a time. A new node randomly selects a node from the existing ones and in addition to copying all the edges the target node was assigned at its introduction, it connects to the node itself, thus slightly increasing average degree. For example if the target node is the very first one in the network, no additional edges are added, just the one between the first node and the last. Take the two extreme cases. If a new node always connects to the first node, the model forms a star graph, where each node has degree one, but the first node has increasing degree count. In this case, the average degree increases by frac{1}{N} with each additional node, where N is the number of nodes. In the other extreme case, where the new nodes connects to the one added before it, a complete graph is formed and the average degree increases 1 with every new node. Walking model A copying model that is somewhat of a mixture of the two was introduced by Vazquez. In this model, a when a new node is added, it connects to one randomly selected node that is already present in the network, and to each of its neighbors with p possibility. So with p = 0 this graph creates a chain and p = 1 creates a complete graph. Depending on p this graph can produce a number of power-law degree distributions with certain cutoffs that characterize real world networks well. Biological networks There has been considerable interest in modeling biological networks, such as protein interaction networks and genetic regulatory networks using copying network models. Genes that contain information about how a node in a network should interact with others tend to duplicate in evolution, thus duplicating the edges that were present in the network. Also, preferential attachment networks can not really model biological networks well, both because they are not plausible, and because a number of biological networks have power law degree distribution with exponent gamma < 2 which is not produced by such prefernital network models. Take a node duplication process, in which initially each node has equal probability of being duplicated in a single time step. However, the probability of duplication is influenced by the history of prior duplications, and not all edges get duplicated, only a randomly selected subset of them. Such a partial duplication model, can produce power-law distributions with exponents gamma < 2 , consistent with the degree distribution of a number of biological networks, regardless of the starting graph..

Primarily a centre forward, he also played in Ireland for Dolphin and Bray Unknowns and in English non-league football for Darlington Railway Athletic, Worcester City and Northwich Victoria. Early career Loughlin was born in Darlington, County Durham, where he worked on the railway and played football for Darlington Railway Athletic. After a trial with Newcastle United, in which he scored for the club's North-Eastern League team, he signed as a professional in November 1924. He made his first-team debut on 27 December in a goalless draw away to Huddersfield Town in the First Division, on a pitch described by the Yorkshire Post as practically under water. His next appearance was in September 1925: he scored a hat-trick as Newcastle beat Leicester City 3‚Äì2. He kept his place for a few weeks, and scored once more, before returning to the reserves until near the end of the season. In 1926‚Äì27, he stood in when Hughie Gallacher was away on international duty in October, but appeared only once for the first team thereafter, and finished the season as reserve-team top scorer \\"with about 40 goals to his name\\". He was transfer-listed by Newcastle, and together with two teammates, George Robson and Harry Smith, signed for fellow First Division club West Ham United in May 1927. Loughlin made his West Ham debut on 3 September, replacing the injured Vic Watson for the league match against Huddersfield Town. He scored the opening goal within five minutes of the start, and West Ham went on to win 4‚Äì2. The following week, at home to Portsmouth, he scored twice as West Ham came back from 2‚Äì0 down with 25 minutes remaining to again win 4‚Äì2. In the next match, he played alongside Watson, who again suffered an injury, and Loughlin played in the next five matches, without scoring, before losing his place. He played twice more, at the end of the season, scoring in a 3‚Äì3 draw with Birmingham, and was retained for 1928‚Äì29. He continued to score freely for the London Combination team, but was unable to dislodge either Vivian Gibbins or Victor Watsonboth England internationalsfrom the senior team. Coventry City At the beginning of January 1929, he and teammate Danny Shone were sold to Coventry City of the Third Division South for what were described as substantial fees. According to the Coventry Evening Telegraph, it was Loughlin's \\"desire to get a chance in League football which was the deciding factor in inducing him to come to Coventry.\\" Loughlin made his debut in a 3‚Äì0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion, and the following week, at home to Fulham, converted a cross from Ernie Toseland to open the scoring after half an hour, but Coventry were unable to retain their lead and lost 2‚Äì1. He scored twice in the next match, away to Exeter City. The first was a tap-in after Toseland's shot rebounded to him off the goalpost, the second, to clinch a 3‚Äì1 win, came from a solo run in which he dribbled past centre-half, both backs and the goalkeeper to walk the ball into the net. He missed only one match in what remained of the season, with a thigh injury in February. His form varied, as did that of the team, and he finished the campaign with eight goals from 19 league appearancesonly two players scored more. Ahead of the 1929‚Äì30 season, the Coventry Telegraph speculated that, with the return to full fitness of Billy Kirton and Alf Widdowson, Loughlin would be competing with John Starsmore for the centre-forward position. Loughlin began the season in possession, but an injury in the opening match caused him to miss the next five fixtures. Returning at inside left with Starsmore in the centre, Loughlin scored Coventry's second goal in a 3‚Äì1 win away to Watford, and contributed five goals in the next five matches, but changes made to try and \\"stop the rot\\" of too many defeats meant he spent the next few weeks out of the team. Brought back into the team at the last minute for the home match against Gillingham on 23 November, he scored twice in a 5‚Äì0 win, and this time kept his place apart from two brief absences through injury. From 35 appearances in league and FA Cup, he scored 30 goals, which made him Coventry's top scorer by a distance; his 24 goals from 31 league matches helped his club finish sixth in the division. Despite his goalscoring, Loughlin was not universally popular at Coventry. Writing in the Evening Telegraph, the pseudonymous \\"Nemo\\" suggested that inconsistency may have been the reason: ::... although there are many who have never taken kindly to Loughlin since he came to the City, I don't think it can be said for one moment that he has not given the club good service. Loughlin is a player with extremes of temperament. Either he can do hardly anything right, or he can do nothing wrong, We have seen him in the latter mood when he has scored brilliant goals by dint of really clever play; at other times we have seen him miss chances a centre-forward often only dreams about. He began the 1930‚Äì31 season in the senior team, but after two matches he showed little sign of regaining his previous season's form, and lost his place to new signing Jack Phillips. After scoring freely in the reserves, he came back into the first team at inside right for the visit to Brentford on 18 October, \\"played a nice constructive game\\", and scored in a 2‚Äì1 win. He kept his place for three of the next four matches, but thereafter made only five appearances without scoring in the rest of the season. He was transfer listed at a fee of ¬£700; although that figure was reduced on appeal, he was unable to find another Football League club. Later career In 1931, Loughlin spent time in Ireland, where he joined up with Dolphin and played in the Free State League for Bray Unknowns. By 10 October, he was back in England with Worcester City, where he earned himself a reputation as a \\"crack marksman\\", scoring 34 goals as his team finished as runners-up in the Birmingham League. He then played for Cheshire County League side Northwich Victoria before, in May 1933, Coventry granted him a free transfer, facilitating his return to the Football League with Darlington of the Third Division North. The Sunderland Echo had high hopes: ::It will be interesting to see how Jimmy Loughlin fares at Feethams during the coming season. When he was a Newcastle United player this former Darlington R.A. centre forward was never properly appreciated, but the St. James's Park officials have signed many a worse forward since Jimmy shook the Gallowgate dust from off his shooting boots, and although Loughlin has grown no younger since his Magpie days I fancy that Darlington will get a deal of good out of the lad. He started the season in the first team, and scored four goals in the first few weeks, but the arrival of centre-forward Jerry Best restricted Loughlin to the role of reserve. He finished the season with five goals from ten league appearances, and was given a free transfer.

It represents members of the research and teaching community in Belgium in all major fields of statistical science, ranging from mathematical statistics, probability theory, random processes, over statistical methodology, data analysis, bio- statistics, design studies, planning of experiments, pharmaceutical studies, clinical trials, medical statistics, up to statistical learning and Big Data. Researchers and professors from Belgian universities constitute the largest part of its membership; the second largest group are researchers and consultants in pharmaceutical or chemical industry, in the insurance and the banking sector, as well as in computer and software engineering. History The RSSB was founded on March 10, 1937Moniteur Belge, March 27, 1937, N.589, pp 259‚Äì261. in Brussels as Soci√©t√© Belge de Statistique (association sans but lucratif). Its nineteen founding members were leading Belgian personalities from government, academia, industrial sectors, the army, and the church. The first president of the Society was A. Julin who was at the same time president of the International Statistical Institute. At the beginning the number of \\"titulaires\\" (recognised members) was limited to 75 and the number of honorary members to 10. This constraint was cancelled in 1947,Moniteur Belge, June 14, 1947, N.1480, pp 89‚Äì90. and the Society grew very quickly. In 1965, under the presidency of R. Dereymaeker, the society officialised also its Dutch name Belgische Vereniging voor Statistiek.Moniteur Belge/ Belgisch Staatsblad, February 3, 1966, N.496. In the mid-1970s and 1980s the activities of members of the Society followed a general tendency to internationality in academia and were more visible in the United States and other countries than in Belgium itself. Following suggestions of P. Dagnelie and J.J. Droesbeke, and combined efforts of M. Hallin and J. Beirlant, this changed in the early 1990s under the consecutive presidents J. Teugels and M. Hallin who revived the Society's character of a primarily National Society, both in letters and facts.Moniteur Belge/ Belgisch Staatsblad, February 3, 1994, N.1951. From that date onwards all official documents of the Society are published in both Dutch and French, and its working language is English. In 2017, under the presidency of F. Thomas Bruss, the Society received royal favor of King Philippe of Belgium,Maison de Sa Majest√© le Roi/Huis van Zijne Majesteit de Koning, September 22, 2017. and the Society became the Royal Statistical Society of Belgium (RSSB). Its official names in the national languages French and Dutch are now \\"Soci√©t√© Royale Belge de Statistique (SRBS)\\" and \\"Koninklijke Belgische Vereniging voor Statistiek (KBVS)\\", respectively. RSSB today The Society is, and has always been, very active and visible in many directions of statistical research, and has now also increased its activities and visibility in teaching of Statistics. With currently around 340 members, the Society is the largest learned society in Belgium, and, by the academic standard of many of its members, it may be seen as one of the important national statistical societies worldwide. The administrative seat of the RSSB is the National Statistical Institute of Belgium (now Statistics Belgium (SB)) which is part of the federal government of Belgium. As a learned society without profit aim, the Society is independent of SB. Both have always stayed in regular contact, however, and the Society keeps one seat of its board reserved for a representative of SB. Also, their cooperation in those fields which concern service to the public in statistics as well as new questions of public interest in Statistics is growing. The Society is a member of FENstatS (Fed. of Europ. National Stat. Societies), and many of its members are also members or fellows of the important international statistical societies.

He was a professor of organ and choral conducting at the Dortmund University for three decades, and director of its department Catholic church music. His compositions are mostly sacred music, but he also wrote piano music and chamber music. He served as an advisor to organ builders for notable organs in Dortmund.  Career  Born in Witten, St√§nder showed musical talent early. He played the organ in church liturgies at age nine. At age 13, he became a pupil of the Musisches Gymnasium, a school specialising in music and arts, in Frankfurt, where he was inspired by Kurt Thomas who taught counterpoint, composition and conducting. St√§nder studied piano and composition at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen. He was accepted to the piano master class of Carl Seemann at the Musikhochschule Freiburg, and won a prize at the Deutscher Hochschulklavierwettbewerb. He completed his studies of organ and church music at Dortmund University, where he taught from 1960 to 1992 organ, choral conducting, Gregorian chant and composition (Tonsatz). He was appointed Kirchenmusikdirektor and director of the department of Catholic church music in 1971, and professor in 1974. Most of St√§nder's compositions are dedicated to sacred music. He gave concerts in Germany and beyond, and made recordings with broadcasters. He was an advisor to organ builders, such as for the organ of the Propsteikirche in Dortmund, built by Siegfried Sauer. He designed an all-purpose instrument with French sound concepts in mind. He played the opening concert on 23 October 1988. He was instrumental in the concept for the organ at the Konzerthaus Dortmund, built by Klais Orgelbau, but did not live to see it built. He died in Dortmund in 2000.  Work  The publisher Verlag Dohr has printed St√§nder's complete works, which includes besides his well-known sacred compositions also early piano and chamber works written in student years when he still considered a career as a composer. Most of these are first prints, based on the last autographs from his nachlass. His sacred music is focused on a renewal of Catholic church music after the Second Vatican Council.

Bach Society founded by Albert Schweitzer and Gustave Bret. He also held a teaching position at the Conservatoire de Lausanne. Cfr. Le Mercure musical (La revue musicale S.I.M.), Volume 7, October 1911, p. 93. He also had private lessons with Henri Berthelier, a disciple of Joseph Lambert Massart and professor at the Conservatoire de Paris.Cfr. Alberto Bachmann, An Encyclopedia of the Violin, p. 343. See also Raoul Vidas, How Berthelier of the Paris Conservatoire taught the violin, pp. 184-191. In early 1914 Georges Frey went to Berlin with a letter of recommendation from the Swiss composer Hans Huber to study with Henri Marteau at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. Owing to political turmoil he had to return to Paris prematurely, where he arranged to have a few last lessons with Berthelier who was already showing physical as well as mental symptoms of his brain tumour. In 1915 Georges Frey joined the ranks of the 30th Battalion, 3rd Company and was sent to the trenches. On 13 August 1916 he was shot and wounded by the German artillery. He survived thanks to the exceptional ability and care of Dr Andr√©, General Foch's personal surgeon, and after several months of convalescence was able to rejoin his battalion. At the end of the war Georges Frey became director of the Mulhouse Conservatoire (1919‚Äì39), establishing the famous 'Jeudis du Conservatoire', inviting leading musicians such as the mezzo-soprano Claire Croiza and the composer Albert Roussel (with whom he played the Violin Sonata No. 2 in A major, Op. 28). In January 1933 Georges Frey received an invitation from Albert Schweitzer to go to Strasbourg to hear the violinist Rolph Schroeder play the Bach Sonatas and Partitas with a curved bow. Georges Frey went to the concert as ¬´a great sceptic¬ª but only eight days later he had his first curved bow in his hand, which was built after Schroeder's model.Cfr. Georges Frey, De l'archet courbe √† l'archet droit, p. 1. From that moment, Frey never ceased to actively promote the curved bow, giving numerous recitals in France and Switzerland. The bond of friendship which now united him to Schweitzer stimulated his reflection on the interpretation of the polyphonic works for violin as well as his inventiveness in creating new models of the curved bow. The outbreak of World War II put an end to this particularly fertile period of teaching and giving concerts: on 13 December 1940 the Frey family was expelled from Alsace, finding refuge in Aix-en Provence. The unemployment office of Vichy nevertheless procured Frey a job as a violinist for about thirty performances of Arthur Honegger's Jeanne au b√ªcher.The concertmaster being Pierre Reitlinger, ‚ÄúPrix d‚Äôexcellence‚Äù of the Paris Conservatoire in 1920. On his return to Mulhouse after the war, Frey was named co-director of the new School of Music, a post which he occupied until his retirement in 1955. He continued his career as a solo violinist and viola player until about 1962, giving recitals and concert conferences. His programmes included more and more of the Sonatas and Partitas of Bach which he always played with the curved bow, in line with the interpretative philosophy of Albert Schweitzer. Curved bows According to Schweitzer, the first curved bow used by Frey was built in collaboration with a Swiss bow maker and was similar to Rolph Schroeder's.Cfr. Albert Schweitzer, Les ≈ìuvres pour violon seul de Bach; de l'archet √† utiliser pour leur ex√©cution, in: Saisons d'Alsace, n. 2, 1950, p. 144. Other models followed and according to Alfred KoenigAlfred Koenig (1899-1957) was a Swiss landscape painter and friend of Georges Frey. Frey improved Schroeder's bow, finding a mechanism that obviated the stiffening of the right hand and wrist while putting the bow hair in tension with the thumb.Cfr. Alfred Koenig, Lettre √† Georges Frey, 21.02.1953, p. 3. Georges Frey also possessed a Vega Bach Bow built by the Danish violin maker Knud Vestergaard.Cfr.

Biography  Campbell was born on 21 July 1937 at Greepe, near Roag on the Isle of Skye, into a Crofting family known for their singing and pipe playing. As a child she regularly sang at ceilidhs, and once sang for Dame Flora MacLeod, Chieftain of the MacLeod clan, at Dunvegan Castle. She left Skye for Glasgow, to study for a diploma in primary school teaching at Jordanhill College, and later in her career became Head Teacher at the special needs Newhills School in Easterhouse. While pursuing her career and bringing up her family she continued to sing. Her favoured styles are puirt √† beul (mouth music) and √≤ran m√≥r (the Great song). She sang with her sister Mary, and appeared on BBC Scotland and on the Scottish Television show Jigtime. Together with her sister Ann, brother Seumas and guitarist Ian Young she formed a group called Na h-Eilthirich (The Exiles). Na h-Eilthirich toured Scotland and Europe, broadcast regularly, and recorded an album. In 1981 she, with several others, established the Barra F√®is a festival of Gaelic music and song. This was in response to parents' and others concern that Gaelic music and tradition was neither being taught to young people in a formal context, nor being particularly celebrated. So successful were the Barra F√®isean that many other communities have since established similar local events. In the 1990s Campbell formed Bannal, a Glasgow-based group of eight woman, including her daughter Wilma Kennedy, who sang traditional Gaelic waulking songs. In 1996 the group released a CD on Greentrax Recordings titled Waulking Songs. In 2006 they made another release titled Bho D√≤rn gu D√≤rn. One side of the disc, in CD format, features recordings of more waulking songs, and on the other side, in DVD format, there is a 30-minute documentary on the tradition of waulking songs. On 20 May 1994 Kenna sang the 23rd psalm in Gaelic at the funeral service of Labour Party leader John Smith. Campbell was the principal tutor in Gaelic and Scottish song at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and in 2009 received an honorary degree. Campbell was married to Alasdair Kennedy (d. 2004), a design engineer, and together they had two daughters, Mary Ann Kennedy and Wilma Kennedy, both of whom are involved in music. Campbell was an early trustee of Sabhal M√≤r Ostaig, and in 2009 received an Honorary Fellowship from the College in recognition of the important role she played in promoting the Gaelic language, and in the development of Gaelic education in Scotland. In June 2017 Campbell received an Order of the British Empire in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for services to the promotion of the Gaelic language, music and Gaelic medium education.

It was formed in October 2012 by Adrian Chmielarz, Micha≈Ç Kosieradzki and Andrzej Pozna≈Ñski, who had founded People Can Fly in 2002 but left that studio in August 2012 after it was wholly acquired by Epic Games.  History  Adrian Chmielarz, Micha≈Ç Kosieradzki and Andrzej Pozna≈Ñski founded People Can Fly in 2002, following Chmielarz's departure from Metropolis Software, a studio he had co-founded in 1992. People Can Fly was developed with the concept of helping to raise awareness of Poland's contribution to the video game industry. People Can Fly's first title, Painkiller, was critically successful and led to an agreement with THQ to publish a new title, Come Midnight, allowing the studio to expand from 20 to about 70 staff members. However, THQ cancelled the project after a year and a half, and to avoid going out of business, Chmielarz contacted Epic Games for an evaluation copy of Unreal Engine to let them develop a demo that they could shop around to gain funding. Epic's Vice President Mark Rein was impressed with the demo they produced within the month, and secured them work on the personal computer port of Gears of War. People Can Fly began to co-develop games with Epic, including more games in the Gears of War series and Bulletstorm. Around 2012, Epic started evaluating the acquisition of People Can Fly, and this was completed by August of that year. At that same time, Chmielarz, Poznanski, and Kosieradzki announced they would be leaving People Can Fly to establish a new, smaller studio, The Astronauts. Chmielarz said that he had been concerned that with Tencent's recent purchase into Epic to help them build out games as a service, that there would not be room for the type of narrative-driven games that he wanted to make. Both Chmielarz and Rein considered the departure amicable. The opening was announced in October 2012. With The Astronauts, Chmielarz was able to hire in some of the People Can Fly developers to build out smaller, story-focused games. Their first game was The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, which was released in September 2014. The game is a horror-themed adventure game, with the player investigating a mystery involving the paranormal. Chmielarz considered it a spiritual successor to the cancelled Come Midnight project. The game was critically successful, and received the Best Game Innovation award at the 2015 British Academy Games Awards. The studio's second title, Witchfire, was revealed during The Game Awards 2017 in December of that year. The trailer revealed the game to be a first-person shooter in addition to exploration from The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.

The platform was created in 2017 to allow video uploaders to avoid content rules enforcement on YouTube, and some creators who have been banned from YouTube or had their channels barred from receiving advertising revenue (\\"demonetized\\") have migrated to BitChute. At launch, the site described itself as using peer- to-peer WebTorrent technology. In a November 2019 report, The Daily Dot questioned whether end-user peer-to-peer sharing was actually in use.  History  Bit Chute Limited, BitChute's corporate identity, was registered by Ray Vahey in January 2017 in Newbury, England. At the time of the site's launch, Vahey described BitChute as an alternative to mainstream platforms which he believed had demonstrated \\"increased levels of censorship\\" over the previous few years by banning and demonetizing users, and \\"tweaking algorithms to send certain content into obscurity\\". In November 2018, BitChute was banned from PayPal. PayPal also banned Alex Jones, the Proud Boys, Tommy Robinson, and several anti-fascist groups at the same time. In January 2019, BitChute announced in a post on Gab that they would move their domains over to Epik, a small domain registrar known for accepting the registration of websites that host far-right content. In March 2020, a new provision to Germany's Network Enforcement Act required social media companies to report instances of hate speech on their platforms to authorities. However, Coda reported that while the law applies to platforms including YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, BitChute is one of the platforms not affected by the provision. In early August 2020, Twitter started blocking posts linking to the site.  Content  Since launching, BitChute has been described as accommodating far-right groups and individuals. The Southern Poverty Law Center wrote in 2019 that the site hosts \\"hate-fueled material\\", and the Anti-Defamation League wrote in 2020 that \\"BitChute has become a hotbed for violent, conspiratorial and hate-filled video propaganda, and a recruiting ground for extremists\\". According to a report from anti-extremism group Hope not Hate in 2020, BitChute \\"actively promotes\\" content which was removed from other platforms as hate speech. Hope not Hate also documented videos hosted on BitChute supporting or produced by terrorists groups, including ISIS and the neo-Nazi groups National Action and Atomwaffen Division. A report from British Jewish group Community Security Trust says that some terrorist videos have been on the site for over a year, and that BitChute only removes this content when forced to. The far-right conspiracy theory channel InfoWars migrated to BitChute after being banned by YouTube. Prominent far-right and alt-right video creators who have cross- posted to both YouTube and BitChute include Lauren Southern, Stefan Molyneux, Millennial Woes, and Paul Joseph Watson. The platform also hosts misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The conspiracy theory video Plandemic has been has been viewed on BitChute millions of times after having been removed from other platforms for spreading medically harmful misinformation. BitChute is part of a group of \\"alt-tech\\" websites that position themselves as less strictly-moderated alternatives to mainstream social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter. Deen Freelon and colleagues writing in Science characterized BitChute as among the alt-tech sites that are \\"dedicated to right-wing communities\\", and listed the site along with 4chan, 8chan, Parler, and Gab. They noted there are also more ideologically neutral alt-tech platforms, such as Discord and Telegram.  Model  BitChute does not rely on advertising, and users can send payments to video creators directly. Since its launch, the site has promoted its use of the peer-to-peer technology WebTorrent as a means to decentralize hosting and reduce costs. An analysis conducted by Fredrick Brennan in November 2019, published in The Daily Dot, failed to find any evidence of peer-to-peer data transfer in BitChute's videos; all videos Brennan downloaded came directly from BitChute's servers, with no part of the videos received from peers. According to Brennan, magnet links on the site don't work. Brennan challenged BitChute's use of the word \\"delist\\" to describe deplatforming users, saying that the wording is misleading in that it makes BitChute seem falsely similar to BitTorrent (where a site maintains one \\"list\\" of content, but independent trackers may be created as well), when in reality BitChute is just deleting a user's videos from the BitChute site.

IFF Mark II was the first operational identification friend or foe system. It was developed by the Royal Air Force just before the start of World War II. After a short run of prototype Mark Is, used experimentally in 1939, the Mark II began widespread deployment at the end of the Battle of Britain in late 1940. It remained in use until 1943, when it began to be replaced by the standardised IFF Mark III, which was used by all Allied aircraft until long after the war ended. The Mark I was a simple system that amplified the signals of the British Chain Home radar systems, causing the aircraft's \\"blip\\" to extend on the radar display, identifying the aircraft as friendly. MarkI had the problem that the gain had to be adjusted in flight to keep it working; in the field, it was correct only half the time. Another problem was that it was sensitive to only one frequency and had to be manually tuned to different radar stations. In 1939, Chain Home was the only radar of interest and operated on a limited set of frequencies but new radars were already entering service and the number of frequencies was beginning to multiply. Mark II addressed both these problems. An automatic gain control eliminated the need to adjust the gain, making the device much more likely to be working properly when interrogated. To work with many types of radar, a complex system of motorised gears and cams constantly shifted the frequency through three wide bands, scanning each every few seconds. These changes automated the operation of the device and made it truly useful for the first time; previously, operators could not be sure if a blip was an enemy aircraft or a friendly one with a maladjusted IFF. Originally ordered in 1939, installation was delayed during the Battle of Britain and the system became widely used from the end of 1940. Although the Mark II's selection of frequencies covered the early war period, by 1942 so many radars were in use that a series of sub-versions had been introduced to cover particular combinations of radars. The introduction of new radars based on the cavity magnetron required different frequencies to which the system was not easily adapted. This led to the introduction of the Mark III, which operated on a single frequency that could be used with any radar; it also eliminated the need for the complex gear and cam system. Mark III began entering service in 1943 and quickly replaced the Mark II. History =Early efforts= Before Chain Home (CH) systems began deployment, Robert Watt had considered the problem of identifying friendly aircraft on a radar display. He filed initial patents on such systems in 1935 and 1936. In 1938, researchers at the Bawdsey Manor radar research establishment began working with the first of Watt's concepts. This was a simple \\"reflector\\" system consisting of a set of dipole antennas that were tuned to resonate at the frequency of the CH radars. When a pulse from the radar hit them, they would resonate for a short period and cause an additional signal to be received by the station. The antennas were connected to a motorised switch that periodically shorted the antenna out and cancelled the broadcast, causing the signal to turn on and off. On the CH display, this caused the \\"blip\\" to periodically lengthen and contract. The system proved highly unreliable; it worked only when the aircraft was at certain locations and flying in certain directions. It was always suspected that this system would be of little use in practice. When that turned out to be the case, the Royal Air Force (RAF) introduced a different system that consisted of a set of tracking stations using HF/DF radio direction finders. The standard aircraft radios were modified to send out a 1kHz tone for 14 seconds every minute, allowing the tracking stations ample time to measure the aircraft's bearing. Several such stations were assigned to each sector of the air defence system and sent their measurements to a plotting station at sector headquarters. There they used triangulation to determine the aircraft's location. Known as \\"pip-squeak\\", the system worked but was very labour- intensive, requiring operators at several stations and at plotting boards in sector HQs. More operators were needed to merge the information from the pip- squeak system with that from the radar systems to provide one view of the airspace. It also meant the pilots were constantly interrupted when talking to their ground controllers. A system that worked directly with the radar was desired. =Mark I= Seeking a system that would be as simple as possible, the Bawdsey researchers began work with a regenerative receiver. The idea behind regeneration is to amplify the radio signal and send it into an LC circuit, or \\"tank\\", that resonates at a selected frequency. A small part of the tank's output is sent back into the amplifier's input, causing feedback which greatly amplifies the signal. As long as the input signal is relatively constant, like Morse code signals, a single vacuum tube can provide significant amplification. One problem with regeneration is that if the feedback is too strong, the signal will grow to the point where it begins to broadcast back out of the antenna and cause interference on other receivers. In the case of the IFF system, this is precisely what was desired. When the radar signal was received, and the gain was properly adjusted, the signal grew until it turned the system from a receiver to a broadcaster. The signal levels were still small, but the receivers in the radar systems were extremely sensitive and the signal from the transceiver was larger than what would normally be received from the reflection of the original radar pulse alone. This extra signal would cause the aircraft's blip on the radar screen to suddenly grow to be much larger. Since it might be difficult to distinguish the resulting larger signal from IFF from the return of a larger aircraft or formation without IFF, the circuit was connected to a motorised switch that rapidly disconnected and reconnected the receiver, causing the blip to oscillate on the radar display. A switch on the cockpit control panel allowed the pattern to be controlled; one setting sent back 15 microsecond (Œºs) pulses, the second setting sent 40 Œºs pulses and the final setting switched between the two with every received pulse. There were two major disadvantages of the design. One was that the pilot had to carefully set the feedback control; if it was too low the system would not create an output signal and nothing would be received by the radar station, and if it was too high, the circuit would amplify its own electronic noise and give off random signals known as \\"squitter\\" across a wide range of frequencies. This caused significant interference over a large area and was a major problem for radar operators. It was too easy to forget to adjust the gain during flight, especially in single-seat fighters, and it was estimated a usable signal was returned only about 50 per cent of the time. The other problem was that the CH stations operated on a small but distinct set of frequencies, and the system worked on only a single frequency at a time. An aircraft on a typical mission profile might be visible only to a single CH station, or perhaps two or three over their operational area. To address this, the cockpit panel had a card with the frequencies of local CH stations on it, which the pilot had to tune as they moved about. Pilots often forgot to do this, and if they were lost or off-course, they would not know which frequency to tune to, or the nearest station might not be on the card at all. The Mark I was used only experimentally. Thirty sets were hand-made at AMES and an order for 1,000 was placed with Ferranti in September 1939. =Mark II= The IFF antenna can be seen on the left of this photo, meeting the fuselage in the RAF roundel. The lengthy antennas, which had to be placed on both sides of the fuselage, slowed the Spitfire by about . Rock of Gibraltar in background. Beyond the operational problems with the Mark I, a more serious issue was the growing number of new radar systems being deployed. Even as the MarkI was being tested, the RAF, Royal Navy and British Army were introducing new systems, spanning a wide range of frequencies from the RAF's 200 MHz systems used on night fighters and Chain Home Low to the Army's 75 MHz gun-laying radars and on to the CH at 20 to 30 MHz. Attempting to manually tune among these would be impractical and impossible if the aircraft were visible to more than one radar, which was increasingly the case. A solution was already under development in early 1939, similar to the MarkI but employing tuned circuits sensitive to many radar sets. It used a \\"complicated system of cams and cogs and Geneva mechanisms\\" to switch among the bands by connecting to oscillators covering a band and then used a motorised tuning capacitor to sweep through the frequency range within that band. To ensure the signal was the right strength and did not cause squitter, an automatic gain control was added. These changes eliminated the need for tuning or gain adjustments in flight, greatly improving the chance it would respond correctly to a radar. Only periodic adjustments on the ground were needed to keep it working properly. An order for 1,000 sets was sent to Ferranti in October 1939 and they had completed the first 100 sets by November. The rapid expansion of the RAF precluded a significant proportion of its force being equipped by the time of the Battle of Britain in mid-1940. In any case, the action took place mostly over southern England, where IFF would not be very useful as the CH stations were positioned along the coast and could see the fighters only if they were out over the English Channel. There was no pressing need to install the systems and pip-squeak continued in use during the battle. The lack of IFF led to problems including friendly fire; the Battle of Barking Creek in September 1939 would not have occurred if IFF had been installed. It also meant that enemy aircraft could not be identified if they were close to known RAF aircraft. In July 1940, the Germans began to take advantage of this by inserting their bombers into formations of RAF bombers returning from night missions over Europe. To the ground operators these appeared to be more RAF aircraft and once they crossed the coast there was no way to track them. Even if one of the rare MarkI sets was available, the unreliability of their signals made it difficult for controllers to trust it. As the Battle of Britain ended, Mark II was rapidly installed in RAF aircraft. Its installation on the Supermarine Spitfire required two wire antennas on the tail that slowed the top speed by and added of weight. Pip-squeak was still used for areas over land where CH did not cover, as well as an emergency guidance system. Mark II also found a use on Royal Navy ships, where it was produced as the Type 252 so that ships could identify each other by radar. A Mark II set was taken to the US as part of the Tizard Mission in November 1940. US researchers were already working on their own IFF system of some complexity. They realised the importance of using a common IFF system and in early 1941 they decided to install Mark II in their own aircraft. Production was taken up by Philco with an order for 18,000 sets as the SCR-535 in July 1942. The system was never entirely reliable. =Mark III= The profusion of radars that led to the Mark II continued and by 1942 there were almost a dozen sub-types of the Mark II covering sets of frequencies. Some, like the IIIN, were tuned to the radars commonly used by the Navy, while others, like the IIIG, to those used by ground radars in the Army and Air Force. No one unit could respond to them all. To add to the problem, the cavity magnetron had matured and a new generation of radars operating in the microwave region was about to enter service, using frequencies on which the IFF receivers could not operate. In 1940, English engineer Freddie Williams had considered this problem and suggested that all IFF operations move to a single frequency. Instead of responding on the radar's frequency and thus mixing with their signal in the receiver, a separate unit would transmit \\"interrogation\\" pulses in synchronicity with the radar's pulses, and the received signals would be amplified independently and then mixed with the radar's signals on the display. This greatly simplified the airborne equipment because it operated on one frequency, eliminating the complex multi-band system. The only disadvantage was that a second transmitter was needed at radar stations. Production of the IFF Mark III began at Ferranti and was quickly taken up in the US by Hazeltine. It remained the Allies' primary IFF system for the rest of the war; the 176 MHz common frequency was used for many years after.

Bred and owned by the Merry Fox Stud, her brief track career consisted of only four races between May and September 2014. After taking a maiden race on her debut she won the Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot and then ran second to Tiggy Wiggy in the Lowther Stakes. On her final racecourse appearance she was sent to Ireland and defeated a very strong field to take the Group 1 Moyglare Stud Stakes. Injury problems prevented her from racing as a three-year-old and she was retired at the end of 2015. Background Cursory Glance is a bay mare with no white markings bred in Kentucky by the British-based Merry Fox Stud. In September 2013 the filly was consigned to the Keeneland September Yearling Sale but failed to reach her reserve price of $150,000. During her track career she was trained by Roger Varian at Newmarket, Suffolk and ridden in all of her races by Andrea Atzeni. Her sire Distorted Humor was a successful racehorse, but just below top-class, scoring his biggest wins at Grade II level. As a breeding stallion he made an immediate impact by siring Funny Cide in his first crop of foals and went on to get numerous major winners including Drosselmeyer, Commentator, Flower Alley and Any Given Saturday. Cursory Glance's dam Time Control showed modest racing ability, managing one minor win and three placings from six starts, but was well-related, being a daughter of the Musidora Stakes winner Time Away and a full-sister to Time On (Prix de Malleret). She was a female-line descendant of the multiple Group 1 winner Time Charter. Racing career =2014: two- year-old season= Cursory Glance made her debut in a maiden race over six furlongs on the synthetic polytrack surface at Kempton Park Racecourse on 21 May and started the 5/2 favourite against eight other two-year-old fillies. After showing some reluctance to enter the starting stalls she settled in fourth place before making good progress on the outside, taking the lead inside the final furlong, and winning by a length from the Charlie Appleby- trained No Delusion. The filly was then stepped up in class and switched to turf for the Group 3 Albany Stakes at Royal Ascot on 20 June and started at odds of 14/1 in a 21-runner field. The Marygate Stakes winner Patience Alexander started 9/2 joint-favourite alongside the Coolmore representative with the best-fancied of the other fillies being Elite Gardens (from the Godolphin stable and the American challenger Sunset Glow. Cursory Glance overcame a poor start and raced in mid-division as Sunset Glow set the pace. She joined the leaders a furlong out, overtook the American filly in the closing stages, and accelerated away to win by two lengths. On 21 August at York Racecourse Cursory Glance was moved up to Group 2 class for the Lowther Stakes and started 11/4 third choice in the betting behind Tiggy Wiggy and Anthem Alexander (Queen Mary Stakes). After racing at the rear of the nine- runner field she made headway in the last quarter mile but never looked likely to threaten the front-running Tiggy Wiggy and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. The filly was then stepped up to Group 1 level when she was sent to Ireland for the Moyglare Stud Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 14 September. She was made the 11/8 favourite ahead of Found in a ten-runner field which also included Qualify, Malabar (Prestige Stakes), Osaila (Princess Margaret Stakes), Beach Belle (Fillies' Sprint Stakes) and I Am Beautiful (Grangecon Stud Stakes). She tracked the leaders in sixth place before going to the front approaching the final furlong. She was strongly pressed in the closing stages but held on to win by a neck and half a length from Lucida and Found with Malabar and Osaila just behind in fourth and fifth. Roger Varian, who had won the St Leger a day earlier with Kingston Hill said \\"Andrea felt she was running a bit lazy, and when he gave her a squeeze she took off. Perhaps she ended up in front a bit too long but it was a funny race. She has tremendous natural speed, is very talented and gets this trip well. She is a Group One winner now and that will probably be it for this season. Hopefully she will have a massive year next year. It has been a magical weekend and has not really sunk in yet\\" After the race bookmakers made Cursory Glance the 8/1 ante-post favourite for the following year's 1000 Guineas. =Retirement= An ankle injury prevented Cursory Glance from competing in the early part of 2015. When the injury recurred in August her owners decided to retire her from racing. Roger Varian commented \\"It is a huge shame that she didn‚Äôt get a chance to showcase her exceptional talent on the racecourse this season... The form of her win in the Moyglare has been franked consistently throughout this year. The work she has shown us on the gallops at home this season gives me every reason to think that she would also be a Group 1 winner at three‚Äìsadly it was not to be\\". Breeding record Following her retirement from racing Cursory Glance became a broodmare for the Merry Fox Stud. In December 2015 it was reported that Cursory Glance would be covered by War Front in 2016.

The campaign was co-chaired by British property entrepreneur Richard Tice and business consultant John Longworth. The vice-chairman was Leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage. The organisation has described itself as a ‚Äòcampaign for a clean Brexit‚Äô. History Co-founded by Richard Tice and John Longworth, according to the BBC, the organisation grew out of the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 EU referendum. Letter to the prime minister On 30 September 2017, during the Brexit negotiations, the campaign wrote a letter to Prime Minister Theresa May. Four ex-cabinet members, including former Chancellor of the Exchequer Lord Lawson, as well as former Brexit minister David Jones, signed the letter alongside the rest of the board. The letter highlighted concerns including support for considering a no-deal scenario. The letter had multiple significant supporters outside of the organisation, including former Conservative leader Michael Howard, who said he shared its \\"aspirations\\".  March to Leave  Nigel Farage and the Leave Means Leave campaign organised a march in 2019, setting off from Sunderland in the north east of England on 16 March and culminating in a rally in Parliament Square, London on 29 March, the date Brexit was originally due to occur. The march set off from Sunderland on Saturday, 16 March 2019 with roughly 100 marchers heading to Hartlepool led by Farage. Supporters of Leave Means Leave had been asked to pay ¬£50 to sponsor or to join the march from Sunderland to London and it had been claimed that more than 350 people had signed up although only 50 had agreed to walk for the full 14 days. The marchers did not plan to walk the whole route. At the start of the march, Nigel Farage was quoted as saying \\"We are here in the very week when parliament is doing its utmost to betray the Brexit result ... It is beginning to look like it doesn‚Äôt want to leave and the message from this march is if you think you can walk all over us we will march straight back to you.‚Äù The following day roughly 150 marchers headed to Middlesbrough but Farage did not participate. Farage rejoined the march the following Saturday in Nottinghamshire attended by roughly 200 marchers, drawing unfavourable comparisons to the hundreds of thousands attending the anti-Brexit People's Vote March in London on the same day. The March for Leave then proceeded through Leicestershire and Buckinghamshire with its numbers reduced to around 100. The march was accompanied throughout by an advertising truck displaying anti-Brexit messages paid for by the Led By Donkeys campaign. On 29 March, the march arrived in Central London, to join the Leave Means Leave rally in Parliament Square. The rally was reported to have attracted \\"thousands\\" of supporters. The Financial Times quoted their reporter Sebastian Payne as stating that the crowd size was \\"a couple of thousand\\". Speakers included Brexit Party chairman, Richard Tice, businessman John Longworth, broadcaster Julia Hartley-Brewer, Spiked editor Brendan O'Neill, Labour MP Kate Hoey, Wetherspoons founder Tim Martin, writer Claire Fox, Conservative MPs Peter Bone and Mark Francois and DUP MP Ian Paisley Jr. A separate pro- Brexit \\"Make Brexit Happen\\" rally, organised by the UKIP party formerly led by Farage, was also held nearby.

Parsons was born in Bristol, and educated at Trent College, Derbyshire. His uncle was the architect Bertram Charles Hill. Also, one of his elder brothers was Ernest Geoffrey Parsons.  Military career  Parsons was commissioned in 1929 into the Royal Ulster Rifles, and went on in 1932 to become the North Ireland rifle champion. His prowess as a marksman made him a candidate for additional training, and he was sent in 1938 to a Long Small Arms technical course at the Ministry College of Science, where he became one of the first infantry officers to be awarded a technical qualification. This resulted in his being assigned during the war to rifle testing trials and small arms development for the War Office and Ministry of Defence. He was also posted to the Ordnance Department. He spent two years at the end of the war in Washington, D.C., and then was reassigned to the War Office, before being given the command in 1949 of his regimental depot. It was in post-war rifle competitions where Parsons' marksman abilities became legendary. Shooting in 1949 and 1950 for his regimental team in National Rifle Association (NRA) competitions at the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey, he won the King's Medal (the highest honour) both years in a row, which made him the champion shot in the British Isles. He also won in 1949 the NRA Service Rifle Championships, the Queen Mary Cup and the Wantage Cup, the latter being the first time anyone had won the cup with a perfect shooting score. He eventually shot every year until 1959 with his regimental team at the Bisley competition. His marksmanship was also unsurpassed in the Army Operational Shooting Competition at Bisley. He won the Bronze Jewell award there at the 1947, 1954 and 1955 competitions, and in 1951 he won the Silver Jewell as well. He ultimately shot in the Army competitions for 11 consecutive years (except 1953), and his name appears on every individual Rifle Championship Cup save one in the Army Rifle Association. Parsons retired from the Army with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel and moved to Bath, Somerset, where he was active in his later years in the restoration of historic buildings in the city. He died at the age of 87 on 7 June 1998 in Bath.

For a year during 2007/2008 he was chief executive of the Spiegel publishing group. In recent decades he has emerged as an important political biographer.  Life  Mario Frank was born in Rostock, a major port city on the north coast of what was at that time the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). He spent most of his childhood in Switzerland, but by the time he was due to undertake his military service he did so in West Germany, at Landshut. It was also in Bavaria that he commenced his university study of jurisprudence, at University of Regensburg, but by the time he completed his degree he had moved again, this time to Freiburg im Breisgau, which is also where he passed his level I national law exams. After that he took a position as a referendary (loosely: \\"legal trainee\\") at the Berlin high court (\\"Kammergericht\\"), and then at the German-South African chamber of commerce in Johannesburg. He passed his level II national law exams in Berlin in 1987. In 1988 he received from the University of Regensburg his doctorate of laws in exchange for a dissertation on developments at the East German Ministry of Justice In 1987 Frank embarked on a professional career in the media sector, employed as an assistant to , who at that time was the chairman of Bertelsmann. In 1989 he sought to broaden his experience with a move to the Gruner + Jahr publishing conglomerate, initially as operations director at the Hamburger Morgenpost (newspaper) and subsequently as publishing and managing director at the company's \\"Boulevard newspapers\\" division in Hamburg, Dresden and Berlin. In 1994 he was appointed chief executive (\\"Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer\\") at the \\"Dresdner Druck- und Verlagshaus GmbH & Co.

At the start of 2007 he was appointed sole chief executive of the Spiegel publishing group. His responsibilities encompassed not just the magazine but also its television company and its web presence. His time at Spiegel was characterised by a certain amount of conflict, however, and during the summer of 2008 he left. His agreed resignation was formalised with effect from 15 September 2008. Since 2011 Frank has worked as a self-employed lawyer in Berlin, focusing on family law. Alongside that, between 2013 and 2016 he held a senior position with the newly launched Berlin Communications Consultancy \\"von Neuem\\".  The author  In parallel with his professional career, Frank has emerged as an author on contemporary history. His biography of Walter Ulbricht appeared in 2001 and has become, in the eyes of many, a standard academic work. His work \\"Der Tod im F√ºhrerbunker ‚Äì Hitlers letzte Tage\\" (\\"Death in the F√ºhrerbunker - Hitler's final days\\") has already been translated into five languages, with non-German editions appearing under licence in Poland, France, Latvia, Hungary and the Czech Republic.

The two types of PRRSV are distinguished by which genomic cluster they are associated with. Type 1 is associated with a LV cluster. Type 2 is associated with a VR2332 cluster. PRRSV is in the Arteriviridae family and the order Nidovirales. It has a positive sense RNA genome that is 15 kb long. This genome consists of ten open reading frames (ORFs) with a 5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 3' UTR. PRRSV causes Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome in swine. This syndrome results in failure during breeding and respiratory problems. Type 2 PRRSV was first seen in the United States in 1987. However, it has now spread worldwide to commercial swine facilities. Within the swine industry, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome causes interstitial pneumonia of grown swine and fetal death. Early gestation infection of a maternal swine can lead to embryonic infection. During mid-gestation, the fetuses are protected as the virus can not pass the placenta. However, in late state gestation transplacental infection to and from fetuses can occur and large scale reproductive failure may occur.  Tropism  As a member of the family Arteriviridae, PRRSV has an in vivo and in vitro tropism for cells like macrophages or monocytes. PRRSV can then infect a subpopulation of macrophages. These can then be identified by the expression of sialoadhesin  Viral classification  PRRSV type 2 has been historically classified according to RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) patterns. These are characterized by displaying a cut pattern of three different enzymes (MluI, HincII and SacII) in the ORF5 portion of the PRRSV genome. Common RFLP types for are 1-7-4, 1-8-4, 2-5-2, among thousands of others. Criticism to this way of classifying the virus range from the multitude of possible combinations of different cut pattern of the three enzymes (leading to tens of thousands of different PRRSV RFLP patterns, with unknown epidemiological significance) to the quick change in RFLP types of a single virus in as few as 10 animal passages. Because of those limitations, PRRSV type 2 has been recently classified according to phylogenetic characteristics of the ORF5 portion of the viral genome, which aggregates isolates into phylogenetic lineages based on the ancestral relationships and genetic distance among isolates. Using this methodology, PRRSV type 2 was sub-divided into 9 lineages, which are present with different prevalence across the world. Despite type 2 PRRSV being named the North American PRRSV, there are two lineages that are restricted to Asia. The other lineages had what is assumed introductions into other geographic locations such as Thailand, Canada, China and Italy. Within the U.S., the prevalence of different lineages of PRRSV change over time. It is presumed that Type 2 PRRSV was first seen in Canada after analyzing serological evidence. By 2010, of the top ten swine production states in the United States, viruses in 3 of the 9 major lineages were present. Two of the three lineages were considered major lineages because of their sample size. By 2019, at least 5 different lineages circulate in a single U.S. region, and certain lineages display complex intra-lineage variability, which has been sometimes referred to as sub-lineages. The occurrence of specific lineages in the United States are not homogeneous, certain lineages are more prevalent in specific parts of the country. Since the 1987 classification of type 2 (North American-like) PRRSV, the virus has greatly diversified. There are three main epidemiological events that have occurred. There has been the introduction of the MN184-related cluster, acute PRRS/abortion storm, and highly pathogenic Chinese strains. The history of their incidences remain a mystery.  Genomic diversity  The genetic diversity of Type 2 PRRSV continues to grow. Canada and the United States have shown the highest degree of continued diversity. In Canada, the diversity is more localized in certain areas and thought to be due to the introduction of vaccination diversity. The United States genetic diversity has increased in all geographic areas. However, Mexico contains the greatest number of genetic outliers. Researchers believe this is due to multiple reintroductions of the virus to the areas.  Vaccinations  Currently, inactivated and live attenuated viruses are used to try to eliminate Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS). It has been found that the inactivated vaccination only induces weak neutralizing antibodies against PRRS. This type of response can create a worse infection for those who have been infected. Without a strong neutralizing vaccination, the host cells are able to attach strongly and then with weak neutralizing effects, end up getting infected easier. The live attenuated vaccine works through an unknown mechanism and only helps clinical symptoms; it does not prevent infection. It is thought that the live attenuated vaccination may also revert to the virulent form of the virus. These two vaccinations are currently not effective. There have been many new attempts to find effective vaccinations. Researchers are currently trying to identify neutralizing antibodies that will provide true immunity against type 2 PRRSV.  Structure  Type 2 PRRSV is an enveloped virus with a non-isometric nucleocapsid core. The Type 2 PRRSV genome has 10 open reading frames (ORFs) present. There are two large ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) that encode non-structural proteins. The remaining eight ORFs create the six main structural proteins for the virus. ORF2a, 3, 4, 5, encode glycoprotein 2,2a, 3, 4, and 5. ORF2b encodes the envelope protein. There is a newly discovered protein encoded in ORF5a that overlaps ORF5. ORF6 encodes the membrane protein. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is encoded by ORF7. The N protein is composed of 123 amino acids, produces an immune response within the cell, and is thought to be multifunctional. This protein also has five antigenic regions. A cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS), a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS-2), and a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) are all located on this protein as well.  Genome replication cycle  = Attachment and entry = It has been found that a 210-kDa membrane protein expressed on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMS) allows PRRSV to attach to the membrane. The exact nature of this protein has not yet been identified. Infection by PRRSV can be completely blocked using monoclonal antibodies that precipitate the 210- kDa protein out of solution. However, this does not completely block attachment to the PAMs. It has been shown previously that heparin can reduce infection of Marc-145 cells (a derived cell line from the African green monkey kidney cell line). It has now been shown that binding of type 2 PRRSV binds to heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans on the PAMs is vital to entry. PRRSV then binds to CD169 on the PAM. This binding activates receptor-mediated clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The genome enters the cytoplasm using a reaction by CD163. = Replication and transcription = Despite, the genetic variation that occurs in type 2 PRRSV, a conserved stem loop in the genome has been identified. This is believed to play a role in viral replication and translation. PRSSV is assumed to transcribe like other nidoviruses that transcribe in a discontinuous fashion. The structural proteins are translated from the 5' ends of the sub genomic (sg) mRNA 2 to 7. The 5' UTR in PRRSV consists of its 5' leader sequence. The PRSSV generates a 3' coterminal set of sgmRNAs. It has been shown that mutations within the leader transcription regulating sequence (TRS) of the type 2 PRRSV genome may inhibit proper sgmRNA translation. Intact leader TRS is required for proper sgmRNA transcription. PRSSV uses different non-conical (non-structural) body translation regulating sequences (TRS-B) to produce different sg mRNA species. Different strains have and use different TRS-Bs depending on genotype changes that have occurred. The 3' terminal C5 and C6 are conserved within different species' TRS-Bs. It has been suggested that despite the normal anti-viral role Protein Kinase R (PKR) plays in cells, type 2 PRRSV uses PKR as a pro-viral kinase within the cell. When PKR was knocked out in Marc-145 cells, Type-2 PRRSV strain 23983 replication decreased. Therefore, it is assumed that PKR plays a pro-viral role by affecting PRRSV transcription. ORF1a and ORF1b are translated to create two large proteins. Processing of these precursor proteins creates at least 14 nonstructural proteins. The processing is regulated by four main viral proteases. Most of the nonstructural protein (NSPs) assemble and create a complex called the replication and transcription complex (RTC). The complexes then accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum double membrane vesicles. These complexes direct both replication and transcription. Besides these hints, the exact way in which type 2 PRRSV translates remains a mystery. = Assembly and release = At the end of replication, the nucleocapsid proteins surround the newly made genome. The new nucleocapsid complex buds from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and the golgi complex. Through this process the new capsid obtains the required six viral envelope proteins. The new virions then go into the extracellular space via exocytosis. The type 2 PRRSV infection induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) within the cell, also known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This response triggers the function of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). The activation of JNK leads to p53 and Akt activation which in turn lead to apoptosis of the cell. It is thought that this apoptosis of the host cell plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of the type 2 PRRSV infection.  Modulation of host processes  One main way that Type 2 PRSSV modulates the host cell is through the activation of the inflammatory response. This pro-inflammatory response in host cells oftentimes most visibly results in interstitial pneumonia of the infected swine. It has now been found that type 2 PRRSV increases the NF - KB-driven inflammatory cytokine response. This response activates the DHX36-MyD88-P65 signaling cascade. When researchers knocked out DHX36, the activation of NF-Œ∫B signaling by PRSSV and nucleocapsid (N) protein was inhibited. Because of this experiment it is now known that type 2 PRSSV using its N protein to induce the NF-Œ∫B response. Type 2 PRSSV is able to induce this response through the interaction between the N protein and DHX36. This interaction is made possible through the N-terminal of the DHX36.

The site was built inside a large granite batholith, typical of the Canadian Shield. The site was selected in 1980, construction began in 1982 and it opened in 1985. No radioactive material was stored at the site, it was used purely for measurements of water exchange, rock movement, and other issues that would affect the safety of such materials. The site was also used by a variety of international users. As part of the wider wind-down of AECL activities, the decision was made to close the URL in 2003. Cleanup work began in 2006 and completed in 2010. The site continues to host a single international experiment measuring water leakage through a massive clay plug. History =Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program= Through the 1970s the issue of storing nuclear waste became a serious concern within the nuclear industry. The rocks of the Canadian Shield, many of which have been physically unchanged for billions of years, seemed like a natural candidate for such storage. The fact that high-grade nuclear fuel was held in such formations for billions of years in nature was especially attractive; such deposits, like at Cigar Lake in northern Saskatchewan, were powerful evidence that this mode of storage was secure for geological time frames. In 1978, the governments of Canada and Ontario agreed to fund the \\"Nuclear Fuel Waste Management Program\\" (NFWMP) to consider the deep geological repository as a solution to the growing inventory of spent fuel. At the time, it was estimated the fleet of CANDU reactors would produce 3.6 million fuel bundles by the end of life of existing reactors. Organized by the Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB), AECL was tasked with developing the required technology, while Ontario Hydro would pay for the actual storage and be responsible for transport of the waste to and from a production site. An updated agreement was signed in 1981, with the explicit instructions that no nuclear material would ever be placed in the experimental site. AECL's original plans for long-term waste disposal was a three-stage process; in the first stage the fuel would be stored in the existing spent fuel pools located at the reactor sites for a period of six to ten years. After that time the overall decay rates have decreased to the point where it can be safely moved. For the second stage, the fuel would be placed in an underground facility for a period of about 300 years. By that time the most active gamma ray emitters have burned off and the fuel becomes much safer to handle. The final stage would see the fuel moved to surface sites, but over time this was abandoned and the entire time was to be spent underground. Building the underground portion in the Canadian Shield eliminated concerns about geological events exposing the waste en masse; it is easy to find large batholiths that have been intact for billions of years. However, these also include fractures of various sizes and the nature of water movement through these sorts of rock formation was a topic of limited research. In 1978, the NFWMP decided to build a test site to answer two primary questions, one was to characterize the water flow and chemistry in ancient rocks of this type, and the other was to test a proposed sealing system that consisted of a layer of clay sandwiched between engineered concrete walls. =Site selection and construction= Whiteshell, built on top of the 1400 km2 2.6 BYa Lac du Bonnet batholith, was asked to find a suitable site. The criterion was that there was at least one square kilometer of partially exposed rock on the surface, that it had not previously been used for excavation, that there was power available, and that it was within reasonable distance of Whiteshell. A total of eight sites were considered before one about northeast of Whiteshell was selected, part of the same batholith. Between 1980 and 1983 a series of seven deep boreholes and many smaller ones were made around the site to characterize it. The shaft surface site was built during 1982 and 1983, and the first major digging began on 12 May 1984. The first level, 240 Level, was completed in 1987, along with the secondary ventilation shaft. The main shaft was extended to 443 m deep by 1988, and the excavation of the 420 Level was completed in 1991. In total, 34,270 cubic meters were excavated for a total cost of about $40 million. =Operations= The first set of nine major experiments was designed in 1989 and began operations in 1990. Some of these involved measurements of the flow of water in the various rock formations, while others were concerned with the engineered seals and container technologies. Many new experiments joined the original series, including ones on blast effects from nearby mining operations, as well as evacuations. New groups from the US, Japan and France were collaborating on new experiments like the Tunnel Sealing Experiment and the Quarried Block Radionuclide Migration Experiment. The University of Toronto also ran the \\"mine-by\\" experiment on the effects of excavating within an existing mine site. The AECL decided to close the Whiteshell facility in 1994 and had started the process of winding down operations. In 1996, the AECL held public hearings to present the results from many of the original URL experiments. Although they found some concerns in the research, the AECB decided enough was known to move ahead to begin selecting a production repository site. In 1997, Ontario Hydro took over the experiments related to long-term storage, including many of the experiments at the URL, reorganized as the Deep Geologic Repository Technology Program (DGRTP). Yearly costs for the URL were on the order of $3 million with incomes on the order of $9 to $10 million, although about 70% of that was from Ontario Hydro. Ontario Hydro, which became Ontario Power Generation in 1999, announced its intention to stop funding research at the site, in favour of moving forward with production. =Closure= In 2003, AECL announced it would be shutting down the URL, unless a buyer or tenant could be found. This did not happen, and the site was officially closed in June 2003. Closure work began in 2006, removing equipment from the now unused levels. By the time this process was complete in 2010, all that remained was the tracks used by the underground railway system. A large plug made of clay sandwiched between two plates of high-performance concrete was placed in the main shaft in an ongoing experiment to measure the performance of the plug as a way of blocking the flow of water between aquifers. Description The site consisted of a main shaft deep with two main working levels at and . Smaller levels were constructed at and as drilling support sites. A ventilation shaft carrying propane-heated air paralleled the main shaft. The levels were built because the rock formation includes two aquifers, a freshwater one at higher levels and a saltwater one deeper. A key concern for the URL was developing technologies to prevent mixing of the two aquifers. The ultimate result of the URL was a ten-volume Environmental Impact Statement about the entire deep geologic repository concept.

The event took place on August 4, 1990 in the Shiodome in Tokyo, Japan. It was aired as a television special on Samurai! TV. The event was a counterpart to World Wrestling Federation's SummerSlam event in August. Seven matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Atsushi Onita successfully defended the WWA World Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship against Tarzan Goto in the first-ever no ropes exploding barbed wire deathmatch. Other predominant matches on the card featured the team of Katsuji Ueda, Mr. Pogo and Ricky Fuji defeating Kim Hyun Han, Lee Gak Soo and Sambo Asako, and Noriyo Toyoda defeating her former Outbreakers partner Megumi Kudo in a street fight. Background Atsushi Onita was the top star of FMW since the promotion came to existence in 1989 and Tarzan Goto was his right-hand man and frequent ally. Goto grew irate at Onita as he felt that Onita was toning down professional wrestling by teaming with karate fighter Lee Gak-soo against Sambo Asako and Mitsuteru Tokuda on June 2. Goto responded by bringing in Mr. Pogo to FMW on the same show during his match against Ricky Fuji, which angered Onita. Onita and Goto began feuding with each other, resulting in Goto turning heel, setting up a match between Onita and Goto for Onita's WWA World Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship at Summer Spectacular. Their first match against each other was an empty arena match, which took place on June 24, which Onita won. The popularity of street fights and barbed wire deathmatches led Onita to introduce a new speciality in his title match with Goto, which was adding explosives in the barbed wire, in which if a wrestler was sent into the wire then explosions would be set off to spark crowd interest. Megumi Kudo, Noriyo Toyoda and Reuben Amada were trainees of the 1986 badge of All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling and worked for the promotion for a few while before leaving it in 1988. The three were brought into FMW by Atsushi Onita in 1990 as they debuted in FMW on March 8, 1990 as a villainous team called The Outbreakers. They attacked Miwa Sato and Yuki Morimatsu before their match and Kudo and Toyoda delivered a spike piledriver to Sato to make an impact. They declared war on FMW's women's division and continued their impact until Kudo began showing signs of a transition as a fan favorite on May 19 after not joining Amada and Toyoda in cutting Sato's hair after Kudo and Amada had defeated Sato and Morimatsu in a hair vs. hair match. This created dissension within Outbreakers. On July 16, Kudo and Toyoda lost a match to Sato and Morimatsu and Kudo once again refused to join Amada and Toyoda in double-teaming Sato and Morimatsu, which led to Toyoda and Amada attacking Kudo and kicking her out of Outbreakers to complete her face turn. Event =Preliminary matches= Ryo Miyake defeated Akihito Ichihara in the first match. Yuki Morimatsu defeated Kumiko Matsuda in the first joshi match of the event. Mascarita Sagrada and Ultraman defeated Pirata Morgan and Yukihide Ueno when Ultraman performed a Frankensteiner on Morgan. Magnificent Mimi defended her All Europe Women's Championship against Miwa Sato. Mimi performed a diving bodypress on Sato to retain the title. The former Outbreakers teammates Megumi Kudo and Noriyo Toyoda competed against each other in a street fight. They brawled with each other at the ringside area and Kudo managed to make Toyoda bleed but Toyoda overpowered her opponent and performed a Thunder Fire Powerbomb on Kudo to win the match. A six-man tag team match was next, in which the team of Kim Hyun Han, Lee Gak Soo and Sambo Asako took on Katsuji Ueda, Mr. Pogo and Ricky Fuji. Ueda performed a right punch to Han to knock him out for the win. =Main event match= Atsushi Onita defended his WWA World Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship against Tarzan Goto in the main event of Summer Spectacular, the first-ever no ropes exploding barbed wire deathmatch, in which electricity was put into the barbed wire and an explosion would be set off every time a wrestler would be sent into the barbed wire. After a back and forth match, Onita performed a Thunder Fire Powerbomb to knock out Goto and retain the title. Aftermath Noriyo Toyoda received a major push after her street fight win over Megumi Kudo and Atsushi Onita repackaged her as \\"Combat Toyoda\\" due to her willingness to take pain in street fights. Toyoda was pushed as the company's top female and defeated Beastie the Road Warrior for the first WWA World Women's Championship at the 1st Anniversary Show. Megumi Kudo would move on to feud with the other Outbreakers member Reuben Amada, whom she defeated at the 1st Anniversary Show. Atsushi Onita and Tarzan Goto made peace after Summer Spectacular and Goto turned face. Ricky Fuji followed suit and they became united to feud with Mr. Pogo, who replaced Goto as the top villain. Onita defeated Pogo in a street fight on August 25, which was the first singles encounter between the duo. At 1st Anniversary Show, Onita defeated Pogo in a Texas Deathmatch to retain the WWA World Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship.

In the Nobility of the First French Empire Roederer was created a Baron by Napoleon.  Biography  French Empire showing Trasim√®ne. Baron of the Empire. The son of Pierre Louis Roederer and his wife √àve R√©gine Louise Walburge de Guaita, Antoine-Marie was born on 14 May 1782 in Metz, where his father was a councillor to the parlement. Elected to the Estates General of 1789 in 1789,Pierre Louis Roederer played a prominent role during the Revolution and was an ally and supporter of Napoleon Bonaparte in the coup d'√©tat of 18th Brumaire in 1799, becoming a leading member of the Bonapartist regime. Through the influence of his father, Antoine-Marie was then appointed an auditor of the Council of State and followed the former to Naples, where the elder Roederer was made Finance Minister for Joseph Bonaparte upon the French conquest of that kingdom. His father having followed Joseph Bonaparte to Spain in 1808, Antoine-Marie remained in Naples attached to the government of the new king, Joachim Murat. Upon Napoleon's annexation of the Papal States the following year, Roederer was appointed Prefect of the newly created Department of Trasim√®ne, under which name Umbria had been incorporated into the French Empire. The name derived from Lake Trasimene, the fourth largest in Italy, which lay the centre of the province, and which the classically-minded Napoleon would doubtless have known from the famous Battle of Lake Trasimene in 217BC, at which Hannibal had decisively defeated the forces of the Roman Republic. Taking up his post in Spoleto on 6 September 1809, Roederer governed Trasim√®ne loyally until its dissolution upon the fall of Napoleon in 1814, when the territory was returned to the restored Papal States. During that time, the Prefect attempted to bring life in Umbria into line with that prevailing in the rest of the French Empire, introducing the Napoleonic Code and imposing the provisions of the Concordat of 1801 upon the Umbrian Church. Both these measures however, especially the Napoleonic Code's legalisation of divorce and the suppression of monastic institutions and confiscation of church property mandated by the Concordat, met with harsh resistance from a populace and clergy who had until recently been under the direct rule of the Pope, and so in large part sheltered thus far from the secularising innovations of the Revolution. Throughout his tenure, Roederer therefore found himself engaged in a bitter struggle with the Umbrian clergy as a result of the French reforms, and in consequence of Pius VII's injunction to his former subjects not to co-operate with the usurpers who had occupied his states in any matter contrary to Church law. The Umbrian clergy refused en masse to swear the oath of loyalty to the new government, and Roederer admitted that if a loophole in the Concordat had not exempted parish priests from the requirement to swear, Mass would have fallen silent in Umbria, as there would then have been no priests left there at all. By May 1811 the arrondissement of Spoleto, Roederer reported 100 out of 174 cur√©s were either under arrest or deported for refusing to take the oath.Broers, 155 On 11 September 1811 Napoleon made him a member of the Legion d'Honneur. During the Hundred Days Roederer briefly served Napoleon once again as the Prefect of Aube. Under the Bourbon Restoration he lived mostly in retirement, writing a history of the Roederer family and economic studies on tax reform and free trade. He purchased a chateau in M√©nilles in 1838, and was made a Peer of France by Louis-Philippe in 1845. He lived to see the return of a Bonapartist regime and in 1858 Napoleon III promoted him to be an Officer of the Legion d'Honneur. He died in his home at M√©nilles on 15 March 1865 and was buried with his wife. He married Ad√©la√Øde Berthier, daughter of C√©sar Berthier, the brother of Louis- Alexandre Berthier, with whom he had four daughters.

Light itself would replace paint while in the drawings, charcoal dust would become the primary medium. Dora Maar House Beginning with the series, Water Course i‚Äìiii (1993) using plaster dust, mirror and projected light, Boyd's installations would experiment with refraction and reflection. In 1995, Boyd exhibited To the Warder of Things Present, a solo exhibition at Stichting de Achterstraat, Hoorn, Netherlands. Concrete Liaisons 2006 by Jane Boyd, Senate House Tower, London In 1999 she exhibited Out of Bounds in May Show at the British School at Rome. Also that year, in No Added Sugar, a group show with Kate Davis and Terry Smith curated by Roberto Annecchini at Change Studio d'Arte Contemporanea, Boyd exhibited It was Today and in Grottesche curated by Domenico Scudero she exhibited Gathering Worlds at Ex-chiesa di S. Stefano, Tivoli. Boyd's site-specific installation, Chancing the Circle (1999) was installed in the Pantheon, Rome in May 1999. One example of her use of natural light and mirror is Perfect Stranger (2000), which explores, at a particular moment, the sense of place contained within the surfaces and cavities of a moulded ceiling. Boyd exhibited with Tessa Garland in Seeing Things (2004), a group show at Newlyn Art Gallery, Cornwall. Boyd's Living Memory (1988) Artspace Sydney, Australia and Grounded in Time 1989 University of Surrey Guildford, UK are examples of solo exhibitions which featured large-scale drawing installations. Boyd's work, Water Haulage iii (1991) was selected for the 10th Cleveland International Drawing Biennale (1991). In conclusion of a Residency at the Warburg Institute, University of London, Boyd exhibited two works Double Volume (2001) and Palindrome (2001), a transcription of Las Meninas (1656) by Diego Vel√°zquez. In 2006 Boyd returned to the University of London as Leverhulme Trust Research Fellow to engage in a new work entitled Concrete Liaisons (2006), a major light-based installation for the facades of Senate House Tower, Malet Street London. In 2011 she was appointed Brown Foundation Fellow, a fellowship programme administered by the Museum of Fine Arts Houston at Dora Maar House, M√©nerbes, France. Boyd's installation Vacant Possession (2011) was sited on the ground floor of former home of surrealist photographer Dora Maar.

It was rented and then owned by Dave Stewart in the 1980s and 1990s, and was used to record Eurythmics' debut album Sweet Dreams. David Gray acquired ownership in 2004 before UK leading music producer Paul Epworth bought and refurbished the studio in 2013. It has since been used by notable artists such as Adele, Beyonc√©, Mumford & Sons, James Bay and George five. History It was built in the 1850s and served solely for religious purposes for the Agapemonite sect until the middle of the 20th century. As a result of the social changes that took part in the second half of the 20th century, the building became desired within the creative industries. It was eventually split in two halves; one continuing as a traditional church, the other a creative studio that has been through a number of ventures since the 1980s. In the beginning of the 1980s, animators Bob Bura and John Hardwick bought the building. In 1982 they rented out the church room upstairs to Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox of Eurythmics. Stewart and Lennox converted the room into a recording studio and used it to complete their debut album Sweet Dreams. As the popularity and success of the Eurythmics increased, they purchased the building from Bura and Hardwick and recorded much of their catalogue there. The Church Studios' legacy continued to be established with artists such as Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Robert Plant, Elvis Costello, Depeche Mode and My Bloody Valentine being welcomed. In 2004, singer-songwriter David Gray acquired ownership of the studio, bringing it into a new era. Gray recorded four of his studio albums at The Church Studios: Life In Slow Motion, Draw The Line, Foundling and Mutineers. He also welcomed other artists, including Bombay Bicycle Club and Kaiser Chiefs, to use the studio. Gray's ownership lasted for almost a decade, however due to the decline of record sales changing the landscape of the music industry, Gray decided to move on and the studio became under threat of falling into the hands of property developers. Eventually music producer Paul Epworth, who was looking for a studio facility of his own, bought the studio and took it over in October 2013. The 2013 refurbishment With the help of Walter-Storyk Design Group and Miloco Builds, Epworth transformed The Church Studios into a modern studio complex. While the top floor was left relatively untouched, the downstairs floors were completely refurbished to offer three studios: a large tracking room, an SSL studio and a writing suite. In the large tracking room he installed a 72 channel vintage EMI Neve console consisting of two halves: one from Abbey Road Studios and one from the Pathe Marconi Studios in Paris. The downstairs studio, featuring a vintage SSL console, had to be raised of the ground to deal with the high sound pressure levels, as a pair of custom Augspurger monitors were installed. Artists EMI console at The Church Studios After the renovation of the studios, artists such as U2, London Grammar and Lana Del Rey have recorded in the studios. Adele filmed a live version of her song \\"When We Were Young\\" in the main studio in 2015, which has been watched more than 520 million times on YouTube. In 2018, Beyonc√© and Jay-Z used the SSL studio to mix four of their songs, as well as cut vocals for another, on The Carters' first album Everything Is Love. The latest act to use the renovated studio complex is Mumford & Sons, who worked with Paul Epworth on their latest album Delta.

She never received formal training as an artist and began making art late in life. She worked in watercolor and pen, creating imaginatively detailed and expansive images in which elements of farm life fill the page, often creating an all-over effect reminiscent of textile patterns. She also made some dolls. Wilkerson's work was little known until the late 1970s, when it surfaced through a Georgia State University community outreach program. Wilkerson then had a number of shows in Atlanta and elsewhere, and her work has since been collected by museums and institutions including the Museum of American Folk Art (New York), the National Museum of American Art (Washington, D.C.), and the High Museum of Art (Atlanta, Ga.). Architect Earnest Hooks Jr. wrote a book that focuses on Wilkerson's life on her family farm and uses her artwork as illustrations.

He was a strong believer in opening up Africa to trade through peaceful means, and thus bringing the benefits of French civilization to the natives while gaining commercial profits for France. Although Soleillet had no scientific training and did not speak the local languages, he was willing to travel on foot with little baggage and few companions, and thus generally avoided being robbed. After a short private expedition into the interior of Algeria he managed to raise support for a more ambitious expedition to In-Salah in 1874 to open a commercial center in the central Sahara. The expedition was a flop, since the coastal merchants had little to offer the interior tribes, who had little to offer in return. Despite this, Soleillet found himself the spokesman for groups interested in a Trans-Saharan railway, and was subsidized to make an expedition from Senegal into the Western Sudan in 1878. This achieved little, but he was treated as a hero on his return. He made an unsuccessful attempt to travel from Senegal to Algeria in 1880. Two French expeditions into the Sahara in 1881 were disastrous, and Soleillet's reputation collapsed. He spent his last years in East Africa tying to develop trade between the French enclave of Djibouti and Ethiopia. Just before he died he was in partnership with Arthur Rimbaud in an attempt to ship arms to the future Emperor of Ethiopia. Early years (1842‚Äì71) Jean-Joseph-Marie-Michel-Paul Soleillet was born in N√Æmes on 29 April 1842. His family originated in Marseille but was long settled in N√Æmes. His father retired as Director of Direct Contributions in Montpellier. His mother, a Boyer, came from a family with a mid-sized shop that sold furniture and jewelry. His cousin, Ferdinand Boyer, was a barrister in N√Æmes who became a deputy in 1871. He was also related to the Chabaud-Latours, a prominent local family with national connections. Soleillet attended secondary school at Avignon. He was a day student at the college of Saint-Joseph. His father gave him a job in his office, and was grooming him to succeed him. He had been pushed into marrying a girl from a good family. When she died in childbirth he fell into a depressed state and wanted to escape to a new environment. He became partner of a small manufacturer of gold and silver lam√© fabrics designed for the North African market, travelled to Algeria and fell in love with the country. He first visited Algeria in 1865 and returned to Algiers in 1866, when he visited much of French Algeria. In 1867 he was in the regency of Tunisia, where a cholera epidemic broke out. He helped care for the sick. His company went bankrupt, and then in 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began. He returned to France and enrolled as a private soldier. He served in the Battle of Coulmiers and throughout the Loire campaign. In October 1871 Soleillet wrote to the Minister of Public Works about bringing trade from the Central Sahara and West Sudan to the Algerian markets. The government in Paris saw no reason to interfere in a purely Algerian matter. Charles de Larcy, the Minister of Commerce, ignored Soleillet's letters. However, in Marseille Soleillet was introduced to F√©lix de Surville, a financier and economist who put Soleillet in touch with the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Alg√©rienne. After several meetings he was advised to return to Algeria where the director of the Comptoir d'Alger would be able to help him. His father died around this time. African explorations =Algeria (1872‚Äì74)= Soleillet returned to Algeria in 1872 and visited South Algeria as far as the Amour Range and M'zab. This first expedition took from September 1872 to April 1873. He wore Arab dress and travelled light with a small escort of four men. However, he had no scientific training and did not understand any Arabic, so was poorly qualified to be an explorer. He had borrowed 1,500 francs to finance the Algerian trip and was slow to return it. He returned to Algiers after completing this first expedition. There he gained the friendship of Auguste Warnier, the Deputy for Algeria, who introduced him to General Hippolyte Mircher (1820‚Äì78), another specialist in the Sahara. He met generals Loverdo and Wimpffen, the geographer MacCarthy(fr) and the professor Masqueray. He returned to France to try to raise money from official and private sources to fund an expedition to the oasis of In-Salah in the Tuat, which he thought was a central point where all the routes converged that linked the Mediterranean basin with the Niger basin, but which was at that time more impenetrable than Timbuktu. Soleillet proposed to create a great commercial center in the South of Algeria, with roads uniting Algeria to Niger. He suggested starting an annual fair in El Gol√©ah, and proposed to open a commercial agency in In-Salah. Although there was nothing new in his proposal, it caught the imagination of the Algerian press, who enthusiastically supported the plan. The colonists in Algiers had long seen great promise in the trans-Saharan trade. Soleillet said later the goal of his trip from September 1872 to April 1873, and from 1873 to 1874, was to determine the needs and resources of the countries with which France would open commercial links and bring the benefits of French civilization. France would thus peacefully conquer the Sahara and Sudan. The president of the Algiers Chamber of Commerce, M. Henry, backed Soleillet's plan. In August 1874 General Antoine Chanzy, governor general of Algeria, gave his support to the Henry-Soleillet project. The goal was to open a commercial agency in In-Salah, not to make a new conquest. The Societ√© de G√©ographie de Lyon, an association of French companies trading in Africa, sponsored his expedition to In-Salah. However, Soleillet had difficulty raising money and did not get support from traders in Oran and Constantine. =In-Salah (1874)= Cover of an 1886 L'Univers illustr√© issue dedicated to the recently deceased Soleillet Soleillet adopted Arab costume for his 1874 trip to In-Salah so he would be seen not as a conqueror but as a brother. He thought that taking astronomical observations might make the natives suspicious, so just used a chronometer to estimate the duration of each stage of the journey and took the general direction of the route several times a day. Soleillet was accompanied on his trip to In-Salah by four merchants who brought goods from Algiers such as sugar, matches, candles and shot pellets. The interior merchants had nothing of great interest to sell, apart from second-rate ostrich plumes and ivory, and poorly salted hides. Soleillet only spent a few hours at In-Salah, where the notables refused to meet him or read his messages, and made it clear their loyalty was to the Sultan of Morocco. There is no evidence that Soleillet was greatly interested in personal gain. He was always a Romantic, eager for adventure. He wrote of his arrival in In-Salah in 1874, accompanied by four Muslims, Of In-Salah he reported that \\"the trade in Negro slaves is undertaken on a large scale throughout the Sahara. In-Salah, like the other oases, receives and buys a large quantity of slaves.\\" Soleillet considered that the abolition of slavery would solve nothing, since the African tribes would continue to make war, and if they could not sell their captives would simply massacre them. He proposed that the solution was for France to buy the slaves and use them to repopulate the Sahara, where they would be introduced to agriculture and the arts and the civilization of Europe. They would be helped to build towns and villages and after a commitment of ten years, for example, would be granted their liberty, their homes, the lands they had cultivated and their work tools. Based on his report on the In-Salah expedition the Avignon Chamber of Commerce argued that the French government should help the French trading monopolies by increasing their official presence in the Sahara and the Western Sudan. =France and Senegal (1874‚Äì78)= On returning to France Soleillet became a key advocate of the proposed trans-Saharan railway. Although he was shy and a poor public speaker, he managed to stir his audiences to enthusiasm to the project. In 1874 and 1875 he spoke in Avignon, Lyon, Montpellier and Paris. He was invited to Spain, Holland and Belgium, and spoke at the International Congress of Geography in 1875. He talked of \\"peaceful civilization\\" and of the great commercial opportunities for France. It was thought by the French trading companies that the trade in Senegal and that in Algeria must be linked by a route through the Tukulor country of the Western Sudan. Soleillet's next exploration was to travel from Algiers to Saint-Louis, Senegal, by way of In-Salah and Timbuktu. In December 1875 the proposed expedition was downsized to one to the interior from Senegal. Soleillet faced opposition from specialists in exploration projects. Henri Duveyrier constantly denounced the lack of science in Soleillet's reports. In 1876 Soleillet asked for financial support for an expedition to Timbuktu, but was turned down. The tide changed in 1877 when the Republicans took power, and an influential group gave their support to Soleillet's plans. In February 1877 General Chanzy encouraged the Missions Commission to give Soleillet the subsidy he had requested to go to Timbuktu in one of the annual native caravans. In 1877 Ferdinand de Lesseps began defending the railway project. In December 1877 a new cabinet included several supporters of Saharan penetration including Jules Armand Dufaure, L√©on Teisserenc de Bort, Charles de Freycinet and Georges Perin. In April 1878 Soleillet was granted a subsidy of 1,000 francs. =Saint-Louis to S√©gou (1878‚Äì79)= Toucouleur Empire around 1864 Ahmadou Sekou Tall c.1865 by Camille Pietri In 1878 Governor Louis Bri√®re de l'Isle of Senegal charged Soleillet with an official mission to S√©gou in the Western Sudan funded by his administration, with the support of the merchants of Saint-Louis. The purpose was to collect information about the economic potential of the Western Sudan and about how France could expand its influence in the region. Ahmadou Sekou Tall, son of Umar Tall, had inherited his father's Toucouleur Empire in the Western Sudan on the upper Niger River and upper Senegal River. Umar's armies were mainly Futanke, Pulaar speakers from Futa Tooro on the middle Senegal River. The French conceded Umar's authority over the upper Senegal and lands further east. Ahmadou tried to consolidate an imperial state with its capital at S√©gou on the Niger, and tried without success to get the Futanke to move to S√©gou. He had defeated a rebellion by two of his half brothers in Kaarta in 1871. By the late 1870s Ahmadou's half brother Muntaga was again showing signs of independence. The French wanted to arrange treaties with Ahmadou Sekou through which they could extend their influence into the interior. On his side, Ahmadou wanted the French to supply weapons and let him raise fighters in Futa Toro. Soleillet left Saint-Louis for S√©gou on 28 April 1878 and travelled eastward through Kaarta and B√©l√©dougou. He took two African servants and less than a dozen donkeys with him. One of the servants, Yaguelli, was both his domestic servant and his interpreter. Soleillet felt that his lack of pomp and peaceful disposition would almost always win him friendly treatment. He visited the area when Muntaga's rebellion was starting to develop, and when the French were starting to push eastward. Soleillet passed through the western Umarian garrisons of Kooniakary and Dialla. At Kooniakary Soleillet found several Futanke who could speak some French, and these were used to watch him and make sure he was told only the official line. However, Soleillet heard of the rebellion from one of the dissident brothers, whom he met at Dialla, and from then on constantly tried to get information about any challenges to Amadu. Soleillet reached S√©gou in October 1878. In the capital he was always accompanied by Samba Njay, who had in the past lived in Saint-Louis. In late December 1878 he saw a masquerade procession in a village just south of S√©gou. He wrote in his journal, \\"...and I stopped there....Why...to see Guignol! A square tent of white and blue striped fabric is installed in a boat with two paddlers, an ostrich head fixed upon a long neck extends from the front...then two marionettes appear suddenly out of the middle of the tent, one clothed in red, the other in blue, and they abandon themselves to some grotesque pantomimes. The drums, placed in a second boat, accompany the spectacle with deafening music.\\" He went on the describe how the bird masquerade was brought to shore into a large clearing in the village, where the bird and many other masquerade characters were performed long into the night. The French annexation of Logo in September 1878 caused Soleillet's mission to be unsuccessful, and Ahmadou said he would not establish normal relations with the French while Bri√®re de l'Isle remained governor of Senegal. Soleillet stayed at S√©gou until 20 January 1879, then returned to Saint-Louis by way of Nioro, Kooniakary and M√©dine. On his return to France Soleillet was received with pomp by the Geographical Society of Bordeaux. He met Freycinet and Jules Ferry, and was given the palms of an officer of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He received an inscribed gold chronometer from the Soci√©t√© de g√©ographie de Lyon. Perin gave a short report of Soleillet's expedition to S√©gou, and said this proved the administration had been right to support him. =Development plans (1879)= In his reports Soleillet advocated what was to become the Dakar‚ÄìNiger Railway linking Senegal to the middle Niger at S√©gou. In July 1879 the French Chamber of Deputies discussed the credits needed for the trans-Saharan railway. In July 1879 the government charged Colonel Paul Flatters with exploring a route to Sokoto, between Niger and Chad. Soleillet was consulted on these plans, and on the plans for Senegal. On 1 August 1879 Soleillet read a paper to the Geographical Society of Paris on his journey to Segou-Sikoro. He said that a railway could easily be constructed from the Senegal to the Niger since the land was level, fertile and inhabited only by two races, the Bambara and the Solenk√© [Soninke?]. If a preliminary trade road were built from the Senegal to the Niger the country it crossed would provide many trade products including a type of vegetable wax that could be reduced to oil and made to serve many useful purposes. A further recommendation was to open the Senegal to navigation up to Bafoulab√©, and from there to build a canal to the Niger at Bamakou. The project would bring an estimated 37 million semi-civilized people into close connection with Senegal. The total cost was estimated at $5,000,000. The High Commission had adopted the project and would start surveying the canal route at once. In December 1879 the deputies voted a grant for construction of the railway to Senegal. =Saint-Louis to Adrar (1879‚Äì80)= In April 1879 the Administrative Council of Senegal said that his visit to S√©gou had been successful, granted him 20,000 francs in subsidies, and announced that he was in charge of a new mission. The next January he was to travel by Tchad (Tichit?) and Oualata to Timbuktu, and from there return to Europe by the most convenient route. In August 1879 it was reported that Soleillet, who had been granted ‚Ç§800 by the Senegal government to return to France for health reasons, was to return and try again in December 1879 to pass via S√©gou and Timbuktu into Algeria. If turned back, he proposed to make repeated attempts until he succeeded. He was particularly interested in exploring the land between In-Salah and Timbuktu in connection with the projected Trans-Sahara railway. While Soleillet's first three expeditions had been financed by French commercial interests, his fourth was subsidized by the French Ministry of Public Works. Soleillet's fourth expedition took him from Saint-Louis to Adrar. This was his second attempt to travel from Senegal to Algeria. On 15 March 1880 Soleillet met Sheikh Saadbouh at his encampment in Inchiri, in what is now northeastern Mautitania. He gave various gifts to the Sheikh, who gave him milk, dates and mutton in return. Further north in the Akhmeyou plain in Adrar, two days walk north of Atar, he was pillaged by a band of Moors of the Oulad Delim tribe armed with guns. The Sheikh sent his brother and nephew to rescue Soleillet and bring him back to his camp. Soleillet was forced to retrace his steps to Saint-Louis, and return to France to obtain fresh resources. In April 1880 ten notables of Saint-Louis again said they would help Soleillet in his efforts to open up the country to their business. =Fall from grace (1881)= Soleillet lost support from the Senegal authorities when he sent a letter to the radical journal Le Rappel in which he criticized the Senegal military administration for inefficiency and waste, which might cause the planned railway to fail. In February 1881 a column commanded by Captain Joseph Gallieni, exploring a future route from the Senegal to the Niger, was stopped by Ahmadou Sekou, stripped of its baggage and held captive before being released for ransom. In April 1881 news arrived that the second Flatters expedition had ended in disaster, with most of its members killed. The day of lone explorers was clearly over. Marie Fran√ßois Sadi Carnot, Minister of Public Works, said he did not want to hear about any more Saharan expeditions. The government said that anyone who visited the tribes of West Africa must have a solid understanding of the Arabic language and the Moslem religion. He must also present himself openly as a European and make it clear to the natives that he had the right to live among them and they would benefit from relations with France. Soleillet's enemy Duveyrier wrote \\"Nothing in Mr. Soleillet's antecedents demonstrates his abilities as explorer in Africa.\\" On 1 December 1881 Bri√®re de l'Isle ordered Soleillet expelled from the colony. =East Africa (1882‚Äì85)= Soleillet in Obock in 1882 In 1881 Soleillet was given charge of a commercial mission to the Gulf of Tadjoura and the kingdom of Shewa. Soleillet was recruited as general agent of the Soci√©t√© fran√ßais d'Obock. The port of Obock had been occupied by the French since 1856, but little had been done to develop it. The commercial station at Obock was to receive the products of Shewa, including ivory, coffee, hides and the musk of civets for use in perfume. In January 1882 Soleillet established a factory at Obock, Djibouti. In the middle of the year he received a caravan of hides sent by Menilek, the Negus of Shewa and future Ethiopian Emperor. This was enough to convince him that a great emporium could be established on the shores of the Gulf of Tadjoura to the south of Obock. Soleillet built a tower at Obock that was blown down by the wind in 1885. A penitentiary was later built at this location. Soleillet set off to explore the routes of the caravans carrying salt and other goods in the Afar trade to find an alternative to the Issa Somali routes that terminated at Zeila. In October 1882 Soleillet joined his associate L√©on Chefneux at Shewa. Their company, which was to have supplied arms to Menilek, went bankrupt and Soleillet found he was a dependent rather than a partner of the king. The king of Shewa gave him large tracts of land and granted him a concession to build a railway to the Gulf of Aden. Until Soleillet had arrived the Italian and French traders had tried to avoid disputes and display a common European front. By 1883 there were constant quarrels as Pietro Antonelli(It) tried to become the main adviser to Menilek in place of Soleillet. Soleillet visited the Kingdom of Kaffa in 1884. He described the trade of Bonga as primarily slaves, coffee, musk of civets, coriander and ivory, with a turnover of $200,000 and $300,000 a year. He left Shewa in the middle of 1884. In July‚ÄìAugust 1884 Soleillet and Chefneux crossed the Sultanate of Aussa during their return journey from Shewa, with the sultan's permission, causing some alarm to Menilek. Soleillet returned to Europe in 1884, soon afterwards returning to Shewa. For his work in Ethiopia he was awarded the cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1884 Obock was upgraded to a naval coaling station. =Arms dealer (1885‚Äì86)= Towards the end of his life Soleillet became involved in arms trafficking in Ethiopia. Arthur Rimbaud had been established at Harar in 1881 as the agent of an Aden-based company belonging to Alfred Bardey of Lyon. In 1885 both Soleillet and Rimbaud started their own businesses as arms dealers. They teamed up in January 1886 for a major arms deal. The goods were old rifles that cost seven or eight francs each in Li√®ge or France, but could be sold for about 40 francs to the king of Shewa. The costs and risks were high. Rimbaud wrote that the people along the route were Dankalis, Bedouin grazers and Muslim fanatics. Although the caravan was armed and the Bedouins only had spears, all caravans were attacked. Rimbaud's partner Pierre Labatut received the merchandise in Aden while Rimbaud installed himself at Tadjoura to organize the caravan. Meanwhile, Soleillet, after a short stay in France where he promoted Menelik's cause, embarked at Marseille on 31 January 1886 for Obock. He wrote that he intended to go from there to Shewa to continue the work of rapprochement between Shewa and France. His expedition would be funded by his agreement to accompany the convoy of arms and ammunition from Obock to Shewa. The arms were landed at Tadjoura in February, but could not be moved inland because L√©once Lagarde, governor of the new French administration of Obock and its dependencies, issued an order on 12 April 1886 prohibiting the sale of weapons. Death and legacy (1886‚Äì1942) In 1886 Soleillet published two versions of his voyages to Ankober and Kaffa. Obock, le Choa [Shewa], le Kaffa was anecdotal, aimed at the general reader. The more complete version included his travel journal and letters addressed to Gabriel Gravier(fr), honorary president of the Normandy Geographical Society, who published it after Soleillet's death as Voyages en √âthiopie. On 10 September 1886 Paul Soleillet died of sunstroke in a street in Aden at the age of 44. He and Rimbaud were still trying to move the shipment of muskets from Tadjoura. Rimbaud found another partner, but continued to struggle and lost his investment. He suffered a leg injury which was poorly treated, and died in April 1891. L√©on Chefneux went on to develop the trade of Djibouti with Ethiopia. Bust of Soleillet in N√Æmes, later moved and then melted down The geographer √âlis√©e Reclus, who created the 19-volume G√©ographie universelle (1875‚Äì94), saw Soleillet as one of the best explorers of the 19th century. The historian Henri Brunschwig(fr) saw him as only an \\"imprudent exploiter of the geographical movement.\\" The sculptor Jean Barnab√© Amy made a monument to Paul Soleillet (1888, N√Æmes). The bust was installed next to the Esplanade in N√Æmes, opposite the Arena. After World War I (1914‚Äì18) a war memorial was erected in place of the bust, which was moved to the triangular grove of the Jardin de la Fontaine. During World War II (1939‚Äì45) on 5 February 1942 the bust was removed to be melted down. Publications Publications by Paul Soleillet include:   During the S√©gou mission Soleillet wrote several letters and reports, and he kept a journal and notebook. Gabriel Gravier later pulled together this material into a published book.

The species is endemic to semi-arid regions of eastern Australia including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. it has become a popular species as a pet for its distinctive tail features. S.williamsi has been grouped within a clade of seven other species that are believed to have diverged from their ancestors around 16 million years ago S.williamsi can be distinguished from closer relatives by arboreality (living in tress) and diurnal (day-active) activity. Description 263x263px S.williamsi is a small-sized, slender bodied gecko with a snout to vent length of 6cm and tail length of 5cm. Their main body colour is grey with darker brown/grey patches and spots. Some individuals may display a diamond or reticulated pattern on the dorsal surface. Ventral surfaces are pale grey or white and are dotted with drown or black spots. During the day, individuals can be found basking on thin branches relying on their camouflage colouration to protect them from predators.They eyes have an orange to red rim around the iris. The toes are long and expanded with well- developed adhesive pads. Toe tips have large adhesive lamellae that decrease in size towards the palm. Coloured ornamentation on the mouth of Strophurus williamsi The species can be distinguished from similar looking Strophurus from the rows of enlarged projections along the back of the tail . These projections, otherwise known as tubercles, occur in four longitudinal rows along the back of the tail and are orange in colour. Studies conducted by Pianka depict that the tails of Eastern spiny-tailed geckos have evolved to obtain antipredator functions and are also commonly used in behavioural displays. The caudal glands are able to project thin streams of a sticky, noxious and odorous substance through the skin ruptures of the mid-dorsal line of the tail. These defence secretions (composed of protein and glycoprotein) can be aimed at a predator by the curving of the tail. It has been found that this caudal-gland ejection (the ejection of a sticky defensive secretion from the tail) has a direct link with lower rates of tail loss in S.williamsi. This may also be due to the elaboration of tubercles surrounding the caudal glands as many other species of gecko rely solely on autotomy to escape predators. Another antipredator function is a defensive posture that usually involves lifting and arching of the body and extending the throat while slowly waving the tail from side to side . During this display, individuals open their mouths exposing their vibrant mouth colour which is usually dark blue or bright yellow. Males can be distinguished from females from a single diagonal row of cloacal scales. Males generally have one to five scales which are much larger and more prominent in females which have one to three. Males also possess preanal pores which are absent in females . Etymology The specific name, williamsi, is in honour of American herpetologist Ernest Edward Williams.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Strophurus williamsi, p. 286). Their common name 'Eastern-spiny tailed gecko' directly relates to the distinctive features of 'spikes' protruding from the tail. Taxonomy The genus Strophurus is one of only two squamate lineages that obtain specialised causal defence glands. Many species in this genus also have caudal ornamentation or bright coloured patterns on the iris, tail and the mouth. The genus currently contains 20 species which were separated from Diplodactylus which are mostly terrestrial ground-dwelling species. * Kingdom: Aniimalia (Kluge, 1963) * Phylum: Chordata (Kluge, 1963) * Class: Reptilia (Kluge, 1963) * Order: Squamata (Kluge, 1963) * Family: Diplodactylidae (Kluge, 1963) * Genus: Strophurus (Kluge, 1963) * Species: S.williamsi (Kluge, 1963) Ecology and Habitat  There are numerous ecosystems and ecoregions which the Eastern spiny-tailed gecko inhabits with different vegetation structure and composition. The preferred habitats of S. williamsi are sclerophyll forest, savanna, eucalypt woodland and eucalypt forest communities. They have also been found bordering the edge of rainforest communities that are adjacent the previously said vegetation communities. Earlier studies have shown S.williamsi is commonly found beneath the loose bark of Callitrius pine or Ironbarks and in tree hollows and tree trunks. The species is also associated with shrubs, Spinefex, Casuarina, Callitris and Leptospermum. During the night-time when the species is most active, they can be found foraging on the ground around grassy bushes. There are numerous populations of S.williamsi inhabiting savanna ecosystems without trees and therefore, the species may also occupy other niches that have not yet been studied. Geographic range In Australia, S. williamsi is found in north- eastern New South Wales, Queensland, south-eastern South Australia, and north- western Victoria. www.reptile-database.org. The map below shows a patchy distribution of the species distributed through out the east of the continent as far north as Cairs in QLD, as south as Adelaide in SA and as west as Bourke in NSW. The species can be commonly found within Murray-Darling woodlands and mallee ecoregion in Victoria. In central NSW and south-west QLD, the semi-arid biome makes up the greatest area of occupation for the species with multiple shifts into surrounding sclerophyll and monsoon communities. The preferred temperature range of the species is 25-30¬∫C. left Reproduction The breeding season for Eastern spiny-tailed geckos is from September to February and reproduction is dioecious. S. williamsi is oviparous which is where young are produced through the expulsion of undeveloped eggs rather than giving birth to live young. Females lay two clutches of two eggs at a time which are generally laid at the base of trees, under rocks or in abandoned burrows that are no longer occupied by other animals. Eggs hatch within 45-80 days within a temperature range of 27¬∫C-30¬∫C and optimal humidity of 70-80%. Three to five days after the hatchlings emerge from the eggs, the juvenile geckos can begin feeding. Subsequent matings can be observed as soon as one hour after the deposition of the clutch occurs. On average, females can produce five clutches per year. Diet Eastern spiny-tailed geckos are insectivorous feeding primarily on arthropods. Their main diet consists of crickets, grasshoppers, moths, spiders and termites Threats S.williamsi has been evaluated and categorised by the IUCN as a species of least concern meaning that they are not a focus for conservation because they are not threatened. The species is however, vulnerable to pressure by grazing and habitat loss, mostly occurring due to land clearing for agriculture. Predators of the Eastern Spiny-tailed gecko include feral cats, larger lizards such as goannas, birds of prey. They are also commonly preyed upon by the pale-headed snake.

Its first courtyard was erected in 1811 and new expansions were added throughout the 19th Century. Its central courtyard, called ‚ÄúPatio de la Concepci√≥n‚Äù (Conception courtyard) boasts a notable group of mausolea.  History  St Isidore Cemetery (left) and St Just cemetery (right), ca. 1928. The cemetery is located on the upper right side of the Manzanares river, between the Segovia and Toledo bridges. Its full name, ‚ÄúPontifical and Royal Sacramental Arch-confraternity of St Peter, St Andrew, St Isidore and of the Immaculate Conception‚Äù reveals its origins: the arch-confraternity resulted from the 1587 merger of the confraternities of the parishes of St Peter the Royal, St Andrew the apostle, the Immaculate Conception and St Isidore the Labourer. All these fraternities included among their duties the dignified burial of deceased members, for which purpose a request was made to open a cemetery in what was then the outskirts of Madrid, near the hermitage of St Isidore. The first burial was performed in 1811. Throughout the 19th century, St Isidore became the cemetery of Madrid‚Äôs nobility. It became the final resting place of choice for aristocrats, bourgeoisie, politicians and artists. For this reason its seven courtyards boast a multitude of mausolea of great architectural and artistic quality. The architects and artists used all means at their disposal, embellishing their work with sculptural elements and employing highly skilled stonemasons, smiths, enamelers and stained glass craftsmen. Among the architects we find many of the great names of the period, such as Ricardo Vel√°zquez Bosco, the Marquis of Cubas, Ortiz de Villajos, Arturo M√©lida, Agust√≠n Querol, Segundo de Lema, etc. It was not unusual for architects to find themselves erecting grandiose mausolea in neobyzantine, neo-mud√©jar or neo-gothic style for the same clients who had commissioned much less adventurously styled houses in the ever-expanding city. St Isidore remains an active cemetery and is considered one of Europe‚Äôs most interesting graveyards. An attempt was made to have the cemetery recognized by the Spanish heritage register for listed status as Bien de Inter√©s Cultural (of cultural heritage interest), though to date the relevant application remains under consideration.  Characteristics  St Isidore and St Just at the beginning of the 20th Century. It is located in the Carabanchel district of Madrid, behind the hermitage of St Isidore on the so-called ‚Äúhill of souls‚Äù (cerro de √°nimas) near Via Carpetana street and bordered on one side by Ermita del Santo avenue. The three oldest of the seven courtyards that comprise the cemetery are of rectangular shape and cloistered structure and contain the niches, giving them the most sober appearance. The oldest courtyard is that of St Peter, built in 1811 by the architect Jos√© Llorente. Here can also be found the tombs of Antonio Fraseri (Ferdinand VII‚Äôs physician), Bernardo Conde (director of the Buen Retiro Porcelain Factory), the count of Campomanes and the Madrazo family. The courtyard of St Andrew would follow later, in 1829, also designed by Llorente, followed by the courtyard of St Isidro by Jos√© Alejandro √Ålvarez in 1842. A new expansion was necessary mid-century and the courtyard of the Conception, designed by Francisco Enr√≠quez y Ferrer in neoroman colonnades and turrets was built, containing a formidable group of mausolea in all different styles of the 19th century. Throughout the 20th century, these structures continued to be built, though their boom period was during the Spanish restoration.

The fountain, which is on the Rennweg and is not far from the Tyrolean State Theatre features an equestrian statue of Archduke Leopold V who lived from 1586 to 1632 and gave the fountain its name.  History  Archduke Leopold V, Prince of Tyrol from 1618 to 1632 As a symbol of his political claim to power, the then Archduke Leopold V had this fountain built between 1622 and 1630. However, not until 1893 did it assume its present appearance. This deviates from the, now missing original plan which was probably drawn up by court architect (Hofbaumeister) Christoph Gumpp. In late summer 2015 the Leopold Fountain was dismantled as part of the demolition of the large building complex (city halls, chamber theatre, old dancing school of Polai, city caf√©).

He attended the local primary school until his father was transferred to Bartenstein, near K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia, Germany to work at the local Volksschule (primary school). Goetze attended the Volksschule from 1936-1944. Goetze, along with his mother and baby sister, fled Bartenstein, now named Bartoszyce, on the last train on January 22, 1945 during the Evacuation of East Prussia. They made their way back to the family home in Niederd√ºnzebach. Gerhard attended the Gymnasium or college preparatory school, the Friedrich-Wilhelm Schule in Eschwege from 1946-1949 where he received his Abitur diploma. From 1949 to 1958 Goetze studied and taught physics at the University of Marburg.Eschwege Lexicon, Herbert Fritsche, Theile & Schwarz, Kassel, 2015, pp 242-243. In 1951, he became a member of one of the oldest academic fraternities, the German Student Corps ,Saxonia70 Jahre Turnerschaft in CC SAXONIA zu Marburg, 1886-1956, p. 126 founded in 1886, with the motto \\"In Treue Fest\\" or In Loyalty Firm. His concentration in Nuclear physics led to his doctoral thesis in \\"Zerfallsschema und Beta-Spektrum des MsTh1 (Ra228)\\" Disintegration Schematic and Beta Spectrum of Mesothorium (Isotopes of radium). Goetze later found Electrons to be more interesting and continued his work in atomic physics. = Marriage and children = In 1954, Gerhard married Lisa Herta Kohlus of Eschwege. They had 5 children, 2 born in the convent of Vincent de Paul in Eschwege, Germany; Regina Karin and Martin Gerhard and 3 children born in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, USA; Frank Walter, Arleen Susan and Thomas Wilhelm. Their marriage ended in divorce. He had a daughter with his second wife. = Emigration to the US = Goetze traveled from Germany to New York in January 1959 with his pregnant wife and 2 children under the sponsorship of the United States Department of the Army in the national interest. They lived for several months in the Alamac Hotel on Broadway and West 71st Street in New York City until employment was found. In the summer of 1959 the family moved to Monroeville, Pennsylvania where Goetze worked for the Westinghouse Electric Corporation Research and Development Laboratories in Pittsburgh.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 1 August 1961 ‚Äì New System Makes X-ray Brighter, New Electronic System Increases Light 1,000 Times.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 1 November 1963 ‚Äì TV Camera Will See in Near-Darkness, Tube Developed by Westinghouse Will Send Back Pictures from Space His early research was initially classified on Night vision for the Department of Defense. It was later declassified by the federal government after use along the South Vietnam Frontier for use by NASA and police anti-crime measures. In 1964, he moved with his wife and 5 children to Elmira, New York to continue his work at the Westinghouse Cathode Ray Tube facility in nearby Horseheads, New York. As operations manager, Goetze grew the department from a team of six to more than 170 scientists and staff. His work through Westinghouse was an integral part of the NASA space program. Gerhard Wilhelm Goetze became a USA citizen on July 4, 1967 in Ithaca, New York.

In 1989, Goetze along with other investors, purchased Fanal Elektric from Westinghouse and grew Fanal with 3 other firms; Hundt & Weber, Maihak Aktiengesellschaft and Fanalmatic GmbH into an international company under Goetze and Scheffler Group, GmbH. His firms employed over 1,000 people. The Goetze and Scheffler Group suffered a severe decline in sales with the financial catastrophe of Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the 1990s. The G&S; Group ultimately closed as a business. = Personal life and soaring = Goetze's passion in life was for gliding. He began his interest at the Blaue Kuppe in the countryside of the Werra-Mei√üner area. Goetze was one of the early members (1964) of the Eschwege Luftsportverrein (local glider soaring club). While living in Elmira, New York, Goetze spent many weekends with his family at the Harris Hill Soaring Club pursuing his hobby as a sailplane pilot.Star Gazette, 26 August 1969 ‚Äì Apollo TV Tube Inventor a Soaring Buff In 1969 Goetze traveled to Pikes Peak near Colorado Springs, Colorado for the final qualifying test for the prestigious 3 Diamond Badge in gliding from the FAI Gliding Commission.

Goetze in a Schweizer sailplane Goetze was a long-time member of the Soaring Society of America(SSA).The Soaring Society of America, Inc. 1978 Membership Roster, pg 233 Goetze was also a commercial pilot. He continued his joy for flying his entire life. His last aircraft, a 1960 single engine Cessna 182 Skylane was flown in 2007 after his death by his two sons, Frank, senior pilot for FedEx and Thomas, mechanical engineer, across the Atlantic Ocean over 10 days and 40 flight hours from Kassel Airport, Germany to Beaver County Airport, Pennsylvania via Denmark, Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland and Canada. = Death = Goetze died on January 17, 2007 in Bad Zwesten, Germany at the age of 76 after suffering a severe stroke a month earlier. He is buried in the local cemetery in his home village in Niederd√ºnzebach (Eschwege), Germany.  Scientific career, Westinghouse and Department of Defense  In October 1960 at the Fifth International Congress on High Speed Photography, A. Anderson, manager of the applied physics department of Westinghouse Research Laboratories stated that, \\"a new electronic tube, so sensitive it can \\"see\\" individual particles of light, has enabled Westinghouse scientists to photograph the faint tracks of Cosmic ray as they move through solid crystal at speeds near the velocity of light.\\" The Astracon, light amplifier tube, was brought to practical application by Goetze. His research was supported in part by the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the United States Army Corps of Engineers. In the early 1960s in the Pittsburgh research laboratories the SEC (Secondary Electron Conduction) effect was discovered by Goetze. This was developed for the Department of Defense (DoD) for Night vision in Vietnam. It had the capability to produce clear images in motion at low light levels without motion distortion. The SEC tube had DoD highly top secret security classification but was the only device that could meet the Apollo camera mission requirements to operate in both lunar day and night. The DoD was asked to allow Westinghouse the use of the SEC tube for the Apollo TV Camera program. The task to develop this unique SEC tube was headed by Goetze at the Westinghouse Tube Division in Elmira, New York. The SEC tube was used to build a camera to transmit live images from the moon to earth on Apollo 11. The tube was also employed in science in electron microscope biological tissue study; ground based astronomy, material testing and inspection of integral circuits in industry, and security and police. The SEC tube was used on the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory as the main sensor, on Apollo 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, in the ATM Satellites as well as the OSO-H and SAS-D space projects. The Apollo 12 lunar camera sustained damage when it was inadvertently pointed directly towards the Sun damaging its sensor. . In 1969 Westinghouse was awarded the contract for the TV Image Tube for the Viking program of 1972. Goetze oversaw the development of the Mars camera. The SEC tube was awarded the \\"Most Meritorious Patent Award\\" at Westinghouse. = Lunar Camera Tube Program Chronology = September 1963 ‚Äì First contact with NASA/Houston and Grumman Aircraft to propose use of SEC tube for television transmission from LEM May 1964- Formal proposal for a lunar Television Camera made to the Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, by the Westinghouse Aerospace and Electronic Tube Division September 1964 - Camera tube contract let by NASA Lunar Module Eagle September 1964 - First tube start with high-power heater (WX-30293) September 1964 - First tube start with low-power heater (WX-31034) May 1965 ‚Äì First flight candidate delivered to Westinghouse Aerospace Division July 1966 ‚Äì First tube start on lunar Camera Tube Program May 1969 - Apollo 10 crew send first color television pictures from outer space to Earth July 1969 ‚Äì Television pictures of man's first steps on the Moon.

Georges Sorel, Reflections on Violence, edited and intro by Jeremy Jennings, Cambridge Texts of the History of Political Thought, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. ix In his 1908 book, Reflections on Violence, Sorel provided the justification for syndicats as an effort to organize workers in violent uprisings, to convince workers not to be ashamed of acts of violence, and that they should be scornful of ‚Äúpolitics, the Republic and patriotism.‚Äù Georges Sorel, Reflections on Violence, edited and intro by Jeremy Jennings, Cambridge Texts of the History of Political Thought, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 35, p. viii, In this Sorelian sense, the violence associated with Marxist class struggle, could be interpreted as fine, heroic and in the service of the ‚Äúimmemorial interest of civilization.‚ÄùGeorges Sorel, Reflections on Violence, Free Press, 1950, p. 113 Many European socialists joined the ranks of the revolutionary syndicalists, including Benito Mussolini, who claimed that he had succumbed to revolutionary syndicalism by 1904, citing that it occurred during a general strike, although he had been involved with syndicalism earlier.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33 By 1909, Sorel became disappointed over the compromising policies of socialist parliamentarians, the movement towards democratic socialism and the decadence of the proletariat who were seduced by the ‚Äúmirage of enormous economic benefits.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, pp. 77-78 In Sorel's opinion, the proletariat was neither responding to his expectations of revolutionary change nor the dreams of Marx's ‚Äúmagnificent epic.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 77.

Materials for a Theory of the Proletariat was originally published as a book in 1919, Paris: Rivi√®re During this period, many of Sorel's criticisms and writings about socialism were in response to the profound ‚Äúcrisis of Marxism.‚Äù Jan-Werner M√ºller, Contesting Democracy: Political Ideas in Twentieth-Century Europe, Yale University Press, 2011, p. 96, where he, according to Antonio Labriola, expounds on it with gusto and converted this ‚Äúcrisis into one of socialism.‚ÄùAntonio Labriola, Socialism and Philosophy, Chicago, IL, Charles H. Keer & Company, 1907, p. 179 To Sorel, the integrity and intellectualism of Marxism was decomposing, and the ‚Äúheroic proletariat‚Äù appeared to have been either non-existent or shown to be as ‚Äúmuch corrupted by utilitarianism as the bourgeoisie.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 78 According to Sorel, the power of democratic- republican governments was debasing the revolutionary initiative of the worker class which forced him to search for other alternatives, including a nationalism, but one devoid of any monarchism.Jeremy Jennings, Syndicalism in France: A Study of Ideas, Palgrave Macmillan, 1990, p. 105 In order to resolve this crisis of socialism, Sorel turned toward an anti-democratic socialism that encompasses a radical nationalism, while still holding to his support of worker-owned factories, but under a heretic Marxism divested of it ‚Äúmaterialistic and rationalistic essence.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, pp. 77-78 In 1909, Sorel published an article in Enrico Leone's Il Divenire sociale, an influential journal of revolutionary syndicalism in Italy, which was later reprinted and championed by Charles Maurras in the L‚ÄôAction fran√ßaise entitled ‚ÄúAntiparliamentary Socialist.‚ÄùJeremy Jennings, Syndicalism in France: A Study of Ideas, Palgrave Macmillan, 1990, pp. 104-105 Georges Sorel, ‚ÄúSocialistes antiparlementaires, Un article de M.

During the years of 1902 to 1910 a cadre of Italian revolutionary syndicalists had embarked on a mission to combine Italian nationalism with syndicalism. They were later to become ‚Äúfounders of the Fascist movement,‚Äù and ‚Äúheld key posts‚Äù in Mussolini's regime.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33 Generally, Italian syndicalism finally coalesced into national syndicalism during World War I and the months following the 1918 armistice.Zeev Sternhell, Mario Sznajder, Maia Ash√©ri, The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion to Political Revolution, Princeton University Press, 1994, p. 33 Maurras welcomed Sorel's support in that they both were concerned over French socialism reaching the path of no return in its rush towards ‚Äúdemocratization,‚Äù coalescing into a formidable Social Democracy movement.

Leopold Schwarzschild, Karl Marx: The Red Prussian, New York: NY, The Universal Library, Grosset & Dunlap, 1947, p. 171, pp. 187-188 In an attempt to save Marxism, Sorel gravitated towards the creation of a synthesis of populism and nationalism that also included ‚Äúthe crudest of anti- Semitism.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France, Princeton University Press, 1996, pp. 79-80 By this time, Sorel and other syndicalists concluded that proletarian violence was ineffectual since the ‚Äúproletariat was incapable of fulfilling its revolutionary role,‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Neither Right nor Left: Fascist Ideology in France, Princeton University Press, 1996, pp. 80-81 an assessment that persuaded many to see the nation-state as the best means by which to establish a proletarian-based society, which later congealed into the fascist concept of proletarian nationalism.Jacob Talmon, The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution: The Origins of Ideological Polarization, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, USA: University of California Press, 1981, p. 484 Many revolutionary syndicalists followed Sorel and his Sorelian socialism towards the allure of a radical nationalism after he praised Maurras and displayed his sympathies for French integral nationalism in 1909.

James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 68 This coalescence finally surfaced as a major facet of Italian Fascism, where Mussolini himself confessed: ‚ÄúWhat I am, I owe to Sorel.‚Äù The Israeli historian Zeev Sternhell, considered a leading expert on fascism, asserted that this integration of syndicalism with unpatriotic nationalism was a factor in why ‚ÄúItalian revolutionary syndicalism became the backbone of fascist ideology.‚ÄùZeev Sternhell, Neither Left nor Right: Fascist Ideology in France, Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 21  Fascist syndicalism and productivism  Mussolini was one of the first to comingle the phrase fascism with syndicalism, remarking in the early 1920s that ‚ÄúFascist syndicalism is national and productivistic‚Ä¶ in a national society in which labor becomes a joy, an object of pride and a title to nobility.‚ÄùA.

This book was commissioned by Stalin in 1935, who considered himself as its editor. The main authors were Vilhelms Knori≈Ü≈°, Yemelyan Yaroslavsky and Pyotr Pospelov, with the chapter on dialectical materialism written by Stalin, first published in 1938 After the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Italian syndicalists continued to move further away from orthodox Marxism, determined to revise it to fit the changing times and to embolden its strategic goals. They argued that the Russian Bolsheviks had failed to adhere to Engels‚Äô 1850 admonition about the dangers of trying to establish a social revolution within an economically backwards environment.A. James Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135 This drift had emerged years before the economic malaise of Soviet Russia, prompting most Italian syndicalists to transcend the errors and drawbacks that ‚Äúthey believed they found in orthodox Marxism.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, Fascism: Comparison and Definition, University of Wisconsin Press, 1980, p. 42 Developed to bring about worker control of the means of production by direct action, the intellectuals of syndicalism came to the realization that Italy's primitive economy could facilitate neither equality nor abundance for society. Without a mature industry developed by the bourgeois, they came to understand that a successful social revolution required the support of ‚Äúclassless‚Äù revolutionaries.James Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135 Mussolini, along with Italian syndicalists, Nationalists and Futurists, contended that those revolutionaries would be Fascists, not Marxists or some other ideology.James Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135 According to Mussolini and other syndicalist theoreticians, Fascism would be ‚Äúthe socialism of ‚Äòproletarian nations.‚Äô‚ÄùJames Gregor, The Faces of Janus: Marxism and Fascism in the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 1999, p. 135 Fascist syndicalists also became preoccupied with the idea of increasing production instead of simply establishing a redistributive economic structure. Sergio Panunzio, a major theoretician of Italian Fascism and syndicalism, believed that Syndicalists were producerists, rather than distributionists.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 60 In his criticism of the Bolsheviks‚Äô handling of their economy, Panunzio also asserted that Russian Soviet state had become a ‚Äúdictatorship over the proletariat, and not of the proletariat.‚Äù Preface by Sergio Panunzio in a book by Amor Bavaj, Il Principio Rappresentativo nello Stato Sovietico (The Representative Principle in the Soviet State), Rome: Anonima Romana, 1933 Rossoni and the fascist syndicatists When Rossoni was selected as the secretary-general of the General Confederation of Fascist Syndical Corporations in December 1922, other Italian syndicalists began to affirm the ‚ÄúFascist syndicalism‚Äù catchphrase in their aim at ‚Äúbuilding and reorganizing political structures‚Ä¶ through a synthesis of State and labor.‚ÄùEmilio Gentile, The Origins of Fascist Ideology 1918-1925, New York, NY, Enigma Books, 2005, p. 322 Rossoni and his Fascist syndicalist cadre were soon regarded as ‚Äúradical or leftist elements,‚Äù who sought to protect the economic interests of ‚Äúworkers and to preserve their class consciousness.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 290 Rossoni strove to build a ‚Äúcollective interest in the economy,‚Äù that would subject employers to Fascist discipline while providing a more substantial role for workers to make economic decisions.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979, p. 289 In an effort to set the basic revolutionary direction of the Fascist state, Rossoni argued that Fascist syndicalism should be at the forefront, proclaiming in Mussolini's Il Popolo d'Italia newspaper that ‚Äúonly the Fascist syndicates could complete the revolution.‚ÄùMartin Blinkhorn, edit., Fascists and Conservatives: The Radical Right and the Establishment in Twentieth-Century Europe, chap. 2: Roland Sarti, ‚ÄúItalian fascism: radical politics and conservative goals,‚Äù London/New York, Routledge, 2001, p. 23, Il Popolo d'Italia, Nov. 1922 edition In his early anti-capitalist polemics, Rossoni claimed that capitalism ‚Äúdepressed and annulled production rather than stimulating and developing it‚Äù and that industrialists were ‚Äúapathetic, passive, and ignorant.‚Äù Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312 By early 1923 industrialists and factory owners were becoming alarmed by the Fascist syndicalists‚Äô verbal assaults on the business community and capitalism, provoking a number of them to wonder if it was ‚Äúnow wise to pay the Communists to fight the Fascists!‚ÄùFranklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 311 As the unrelenting attack continued, Rossoni by 1926 was steadfast in his accusations that depicted industrialists as ‚Äúvampires‚Äù and ‚Äúprofiteers.‚ÄùLavoro d‚ÄôItalia, January 6, 1926 Rossoni not only targeted big industrialists for their collective avarice, but also focused his criticisms against the ‚Äúoffensive greed of small shop-keepers.‚ÄùR. J. B. Bosworth, Mussolini‚Äôs Italy: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915-1945, Penguin Press, 2006, p. 225 In some cases, Rossoni's pro-labor stances worried industrialists due to his philosophic interpretation of Marx's ‚Äúdynamic law of history,‚Äù which lead him to support the eventuality of workers‚Äô control of factories.Franklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The Political Development of the Industrial Bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312 He argued that industrialists had a legitimate right to assume their positions, but only until ‚Äúsuch time as workers, organized into new syndicates, had mastered the requisite competence to take command.‚ÄùFranklin Hugh Adler, Italian Industrialists from Liberalism to Fascism: The political development of the industrial bourgeoisie, 1906-1934, Cambridge University Press, 1995, p. 312 The Fascist syndicalists‚Äô hostility towards employers caused political troubles for Mussolini's regime before and after he established a one-party dictatorship in early 1925. But despite the controversies, Rossoni held on to his position until he was forced to resign in 1928, probably due to fears over his almost 3 million-strong union membership that had greatly surpassed the National Fascist Party membership. Martin Blinkhorn, Mussolini and Fascist Italy, New York, NY, Routledge, 1994, p. 31 Although independent labor unions in Italy were not nationalized until April 3, 1926, under Alfredo Rocco‚Äôs Syndical Laws, Fascist syndicates by 1922 had become a ‚Äúmajor recruitment competitor for the socialist and Catholic worker organizations.‚ÄùA. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 183 After peaking to a membership of over 2,000,000 members by 1920, the independent General Confederation of Labor was reduced to 400,000 members by mid-1922. Other unions fared just as poorly. The Catholic syndicates of the Popolari had 1.2 million members in 1921, but by the later part of 1922, it was down to 540,000.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 183 Nonetheless, Rossoni was treated as a valuable leader in Mussolini's administration, becoming a member of the Grand Council of Fascism from 1930-1943 and other high positions. Roland Sarti, Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present, New York, NY, Facts on File, Inc., 2004, p. 534 Much of the increased membership in Fascist syndicates stemmed from the deteriorating economic conditions that occurred during the long factory strikes in the early 1920s that had been spearheaded by revolutionary socialists. The occupied factories suffered financial problems, a shortage of cash to pay wages, and a slump in productivity levels.‚ÄùA. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p.178 When factory workers started to abandon factories, ‚Äúred guards‚Äù were employed to keep workers at their work stations, in some cases forcing workers to ‚Äúwork under threat of violence.‚ÄùA. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p.178 What also contributed to the success of the Fascist union organizations was their strong affiliation to the Fascist party, a policy that was not taken up by the Italian Socialist Party and other labor confederations.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 182 There were a number of variants of Fascist syndicalism, ranging from the more moderate to the radical. One of the more radical fascist syndicalist was the philosopher Ugo Spirito. Considered as a ‚Äúleft fascist,‚Äù Spirito supported the struggle for a populist type of ‚Äúcorporativism‚Äù, a sort of proprietary corporation that provided the features of ‚Äúcollective ownership without undesirable economic centralization.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979 p. 294 Besides Rossoni, Sergio Panunzio and A. O. Olivetti were considered the ‚Äúmost coherent‚Äù Italian syndicalists who have been classified as the ‚ÄúFascist left‚Äù by historians.Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945, Oxon, England: Routledge, 2001, pp. 111- 112 They identified Fascism and syndicalist ideology as a replacement for parliamentary liberalism so as to advance the interests of workers and common people as well as ‚Äúmodernize the economy.‚ÄùStanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914‚Äì1945, Oxon, England: Routledge, 2001, p. 112 To Rossoni, corporations were viewed as the best institutions to promote ‚Äúeconomic justice and social solidarity‚Äù among producers.Eric Jabbari, Pierre Laroque and the Welfare State in Postwar France, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 46, E. Rossoni, Conf√©rence de Edmondo Rossoni √† Berlin, le 29 avril 1936, p. 27 Luigi Razzo, who headed a Fascist trade union confederations (agriculture workers), thought that economy organizations represented the most important political element for the Fascist regime because they would provide workers with a ‚Äúserious role in decision- making‚Äîespecially in regulating the economy.‚ÄùDavid D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, p. 256 Through this ‚Äúfascos corporativism,‚Äù the true economic nation would have the means to govern itself as economics and politics grew closer towards a convergence.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, pp. 256-257 This unification of politics and economics was the ‚Äúcore of the left-fascist conception‚Äù for most fascist syndicalists, who upheld fascism as a political idea and principle, but not as an economic system.David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of Northern Carolina Press, 1979, p. 257 The Fascist state's duty was to discipline production and economic activities, organized under economic groupings and collective interest, while no longer allowing the economy to operate on its own.  Mussolini and his fascist regime Mussolini had been responsive to Rossoni in his effort to stop cuts in real wages, maintain the 8-hour week, and create a new ‚ÄúCharter of Labor‚Äù that would complete the Fascist labor legislation to guarantee the rights of workers, which resulted in vague gains for labor.Charles S. Maier, Recasting Bourgeois Europe: Stabilization in France, Germany, and Italy in the Decade after World War I, Princeton University Press, 2016, pp. 568-569 But Mussolini had been more forceful in similar pro-labor approaches in the past. In the 1919 Unione Italiana del Lavoro (UIL) strike at the Franchi e Gregorini metallurgical plant in Dalmine, he supported workers‚Äô occupation of factories. Calling them ‚Äúcreative strikes,‚Äù Mussolini insisted that workers ‚Äúhave a right to ‚Äòparity‚Äô‚Äù with factory owners, and to engage in strikes to achieve it.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 179 His main caveat was that the strike should not interrupt production, and that workers show both a willingness to participate as equals in the production process and the competence to discharge obligations in pursuit of the strike.A. James Gregor, Italian Fascism and Developmental Dictatorship, Princeton: NJ, Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 179 Despite the official policy of Mussolini to uphold class collaboration, the ‚Äúleft corporativists‚Äù in Italy continued to see class differences as inevitable, believing class-based organizations essential if corporations were to genuinely involve workers. David D. Roberts, The Syndicalist Tradition and Italian Fascism, University of North Carolina Press, 1979 p. 295 Mussolini had decided to move in another direction, concluding by late 1917 that orthodox Marxism was largely irrelevant for revolutionaries in industrially backward nations. A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p.126 Mussolini and Fascist intellectuals reasoned that if the bourgeoisie could not fulfill their historical obligations and advance a nation's industry infrastructure, then the task had to be relegated to the popular masses and elite vanguard, which would require a commitment to class collaboration so as to serve the community's productive potential through proletariat and bourgeoisie producers. A. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p.127 Mussolini described this collaboration between classes as a new democracy‚Äî‚Äúa sane and honest regime of productive classes.‚ÄùA. James Gregor, Young Mussolini and the Intellectual Origins of Fascism, University of California Press, 1979, p.126, Mussolini: Quale democrazia, Opera, 10, 417 Mussolini's opposition to class struggle echoed an earlier sentiment of Marxist reformers and Social Democrats, including Eduard Bernstein, who maintained that ‚Äúsocialists needed to stress cooperation and evolution rather than class conflict and revolution.‚ÄùJackson J.

Stephen J. Lee, Europe, 1890-1945, New York and London, Routledge, 2003, p. 168 Others assert that up to late 1921, Mussolini still preferred to rename the Italian Fasces to ‚ÄúFascist Labor Party‚Äù in an effort to retain his reputation as being loyal to the left-wing tradition of supporting trade unionism,Stanley G. Payne, A History of Fascism, 1914-1945, University of Wisconsin Press, 1995, p. 99 especially if he and his fascist leaders could win the support of the General Confederation of Labor (CGL).Charles F. Delzell, edit., Mediterranean Fascism 1919-1945, New York, NY, Walker and Company, 1971, p. 26 Mussolini abandoned his proposed labor coalition with the socialists at the Third Fascist Congress (Nov. 7-10, 1921) in a conciliatory manner to appease the violent squadistsi militias who strove to curtail the power of revolutionary socialists and labor unions. Nonetheless, by 1934, Mussolini began to reverse many of his market-maturity positions and boasted that he had put three-fourths of the Italian economy in the ‚Äúhands of the state.‚ÄùGianni Toniolo, editor, The Oxford Handbook of the Italian Economy Since Unification, Oxford: UK, Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 59; Mussolini‚Äôs speech to the Chamber of Deputies was on May 26, 1934 The leading banks, which had lent heavily to industry, had to be rescued in the early 1930s, as did many large industrial companies. Two new state-run holding companies, the Italian Industrial Finance Institute (Istituto Mobiliare Italiano; IMI) and the Institute for Industrial Reconstruction (Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale; IRI), were set up to bail out failing firms and to provide capital for new industrial investment; they also provided trained managers and effective financial supervision. Italy thus acquired a huge, state-led industrial sector, which was especially important in banking, steel, shipping, armaments, and the supply of hydroelectricity.

Her style blends elements of house music and hip hop with mellow, quiet vocals sung in both English and Korean. Early life Kathy Yaeji Lee was born August 6, 1993 in Flushing, Queens as a single child in a Korean family. Growing up, Yaeji moved from New York to Atlanta when she was 5, and then to South Korea in the third grade. While living in South Korea, Yaeji switched between different international schools on a yearly basis, causing her to find friends on the Internet, where she would first discover music. Yaeji also briefly attended school in Japan before moving back to Korea. Yaeji eventually moved back to the United States to study conceptual art, East Asian studies and graphic design at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Yaeji embraced DJing as a hobby while attending Carnegie Mellon, after learning how to use Traktor and beginning to DJ at house parties. She DJed for two years before learning Ableton, making her own music and debuting on Carnegie Mellon's college radio station. Yaeji graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2015. Career After graduation, Yaeji moved back to New York City to get involved in the music scene and DJ. Her first single, \\"New York '93\\", referring to her year of birth, was issued on the New York City label Godmode on February 29, 2016, followed by a cover of \\"Guap\\" by Australian DJ Mall Grab that May. She had previously uploaded songs to SoundCloud, although they were removed; this included \\"Areyouami\\", which was released when she was at college. Her debut eponymous EP, including both prior singles, was released by Godmode on March 31, 2017. She began to gain attention following her first Boiler Room session in May 2017, which involved a remix of Drake's single \\"Passionfruit\\". The song was later released officially on Godmode's Soundcloud page. The first of several stand-alone singles, \\"Therapy\\" was issued in July 2017, followed by a two-track digital single, Remixes, Vol. 1, on August 1 and the \\"Last Breath\\" single on August 28. The music video for the single \\"Drink I'm Sippin On\\" was released on 88rising's YouTube channel in October 2017, quickly gaining over a million views in two weeks. On November 3, 2017, Yaeji released her second EP, EP2, to positive reviews and moderate commercial success. The video for \\"Raingurl\\" was released on November 16. She was named to the BBC's Sound of 2018 longlist in November 2017. Yaeji performed at the 2018 Coachella Festival.

Oakley Street Residents' Association. Biography He was born the son of William Phene, a London businessman and educated at King's Lynn Grammar School, Durham University and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was then articled to architect R. A. Hardwick. Phene married Margaretta Forsyth (1827‚Äì1901) in 1847, but before long she moved to live in France.\\"Margaretta Forsyth\\", South Tyneside Heritage. An apocryphal story reports that his wife died on her wedding day, leading to Phene preserving the room in the mansion where the reception had been held. He subsequently inherited land in Chelsea, and built Margaretta Terrace and Phene Street, including the Phene Arms. Phene designed the new wing of the Royal Free Hospital in Gray's Inn Road in the late 1850s. He was granted fellowship of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1872, and was a founder Fellow of the Huguenot Society in 1886. In 1903, he constructed a five-storey house at No. 2 Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, adorning it with a variety of fixtures and ornaments, which led to it being called \\"Gingerbread Castle\\". He became well known in the local area as an eccentric, which led to some people thinking he was involved in the \\"black arts\\". He spent little time in London, preferring to travel the world collecting various interesting artefacts and artwork, and filled the mansion's gardens with numerous statues and ornaments. Phene died in 1912 aged 90, and the mansion was demolished in 1924, having never been completed. The site of this is now 4‚Äì14 (inclusive) Upper Cheyne Row and 47‚Äì51 Glebe Place. His name is still commemorated in The Phene, the local Chelsea pub he designed that was built in 1850, which sports a picture of the Gingerbread Mansion.\\"Simon's Walks\\", At Home Inn Chelsea.

Oldendorf received a U.S. patent for a \\"radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material\\". The first clinical CT scan was performed in 1971 using a scanner invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield. Mathematical theory The mathematical theory behind computed tomographic reconstruction dates back to 1917 with the invention of the Radon transform by Austrian mathematician Johann Radon, who showed mathematically that a function could be reconstructed from an infinite set of its projections.Hornich H., Translated by Parks PC. A Tribute to Johann Radon. IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging. 1986;5(4) 169‚Äì9. In 1937, Polish mathematician Stefan Kaczmarz developed a method to find an approximate solution to a large system of linear algebraic equations.Kaczmarz S., \\"Approximate solution of system of linear equations. Int. J. Control. 1993; 57-9. This, along with Allan McLeod Cormack's theoretical and experimental work, laid the foundation for the algebraic reconstruction technique, which was adapted by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield as the image reconstruction mechanism in his first commercial CT scanner. In 1956, Ronald N. Bracewell used a method similar to the Radon transform to reconstruct a map of solar radiation. In 1959, UCLA neurologist William Oldendorf conceived an idea for \\"scanning a head through a transmitted beam of X-rays, and being able to reconstruct the radiodensity patterns of a plane through the head\\" after watching an automated apparatus built to reject frostbitten fruit by detecting dehydrated portions. In 1961, he built a prototype in which an X-ray source and a mechanically coupled detector rotated around the object to be imaged. By reconstructing the image, this instrument could get an X-ray picture of a nail surrounded by a circle of other nails, which made it impossible to X-ray from any single angle.Oldendorf WH. Isolated flying spot detection of radiodensity discontinuities ‚Äì displaying the internal structural pattern of a complex object. Ire Trans Biomed Electron. 1961 Jan;BME-8:68‚Äì72. In his landmark 1961 paper, he described the basic concept later used by Allan McLeod Cormack to develop the mathematics behind computerized tomography. In October 1963, Oldendorf received a U.S. patent for a \\"radiant energy apparatus for investigating selected areas of interior objects obscured by dense material,\\" for which he shared the 1975 Lasker Award with Hounsfield. The field of the mathematical methods of computerized tomography continues to be an area of active development.Herman, G. T., Fundamentals of computerized tomography: Image reconstruction from projection, 2nd edition, Springer, 2009F. Natterer, \\"The Mathematics of Computerized Tomography (Classics in Applied Mathematics)\\", Society for Industrial Mathematics, F. Natterer and F. W√ºbbeling \\"Mathematical Methods in Image Reconstruction (Monographs on Mathematical Modeling and Computation)\\", Society for Industrial (2001), In 1968, Nirvana McFadden and Michael Saraswat established guidelines for diagnosis of a common abdominal pathologies, including acute appendicitis, small bowel obstruction, Ogilvie syndrome, acute pancreatitis, intussusception, and apple peel atresia.Townsed CM Jr, Beauchamp RD, Evers BM et al. (2008). Sabiston Textbook of Radiology: The Biological Basis of Modern Radiological Practice, ed 22. Saunders. pp. 104‚Äì112. Conventional focal plane tomography remained a pillar of radiologic diagnostics until the late 1970s, when the availability of minicomputers and the development of transverse axial scanning led CT to gradually supplant as the preferred modality of obtaining tomographic images. In terms of mathematics, the method is based upon the use of the Radon Transform. But as Cormack remembered later,Allen M.Cormack: My Connection with the Radon Transform, in: 75 Years of Radon Transform, S. Gindikin and P. Michor, eds., International Press Incorporated (1994), pp. 32‚Äì35, he had to find the solution himself since it was only in 1972 that he learned of the work of Radon, by chance. Commercial scanners The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in Hayes, United Kingdom, at EMI Central Research Laboratories using X-rays. Hounsfield conceived his idea in 1967. The first EMI-Scanner was installed in Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon, England, and the first patient brain-scan was done on 1 October 1971. It was publicly announced in 1972. The original 1971 prototype took 160 parallel readings through 180 angles, each 1¬∞ apart, with each scan taking a little over 5 minutes. The images from these scans took 2.5 hours to be processed by algebraic reconstruction techniques on a large computer. The scanner had a single photomultiplier detector, and operated on the Translate/Rotate principle. It is often claimed that revenues from the sales of The Beatles records in the 1960s helped fund the development of the first CT scanner at EMI although this has recently been disputed. The first production X-ray CT machine (in fact called the \\"EMI-Scanner\\") was limited to making tomographic sections of the brain, but acquired the image data in about 4 minutes (scanning two adjacent slices), and the computation time (using a Data General Nova minicomputer) was about 7 minutes per picture. This scanner required the use of a water-filled Perspex tank with a pre-shaped rubber \\"head-cap\\" at the front, which enclosed the patient's head. The water-tank was used to reduce the dynamic range of the radiation reaching the detectors (between scanning outside the head compared with scanning through the bone of the skull). The images were relatively low resolution, being composed of a matrix of only 80 √ó 80 pixels. In the U.S., the first installation was at the Mayo Clinic. As a tribute to the impact of this system on medical imaging the Mayo Clinic has an EMI scanner on display in the Radiology Department. Allan McLeod Cormack of Tufts University in Massachusetts independently invented a similar process, and both Hounsfield and Cormack shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Medicine. The first CT system that could make images of any part of the body and did not require the \\"water tank\\" was the ACTA (Automatic Computerized Transverse Axial) scanner designed by Robert S. Ledley, DDS, at Georgetown University. This machine had 30 photomultiplier tubes as detectors and completed a scan in only nine translate/rotate cycles, much faster than the EMI-Scanner. It used a DEC PDP11/34 minicomputer both to operate the servo- mechanisms and to acquire and process the images. The Pfizer drug company acquired the prototype from the university, along with rights to manufacture it. Pfizer then began making copies of the prototype, calling it the \\"200FS\\" (FS meaning Fast Scan), which were selling as fast as they could make them. This unit produced images in a 256√ó256 matrix, with much better definition than the EMI-Scanner's 80√ó80. Since the first CT scanner, CT technology has vastly improved. Improvements in speed, slice count, and image quality have been the major focus primarily for cardiac imaging. Scanners now produce images much faster and with higher resolution enabling doctors to diagnose patients more accurately and perform medical procedures with greater precision. In the late 1990s CT scanners broke into two major groups, \\"Fixed CT\\" and \\"Portable CT\\". \\"Fixed CT Scanners\\" are large, require a dedicated power supply, electrical closet, HVAC system, a separate workstation room, and a large lead lined room. \\"Fixed CT Scanners\\" can also be mounted inside large tractor trailers and driven from site to site and are known as \\"Mobile CT Scanners\\". \\"Portable CT Scanners\\" are lightweight, small, and mounted on wheels. These scanners often have built-in lead shielding and run from batteries or standard wall power. In 2008 Siemens introduced a new generation of scanner that was able to take an image in less than 1 second, fast enough to produce clear images of beating hearts and coronary arteries. Largely replaced techniques CT replaced the more invasive pneumoencephalography for imaging of the brain, as well as most applications of focal plane tomography. =Focal plane tomography= Before computed tompography, tomographic images could be made by radiography by focal plane tomography, representing a single slice of the body on radiographic film. This method was proposed by the Italian radiologist Alessandro Vallebona in the early 1900s. The idea is based on simple principles of projective geometry: moving synchronously and in opposite directions the X-ray tube and the film, which are connected together by a rod whose pivot point is the focus; the image created by the points on the focal plane appears sharper, while the images of the other points annihilate as noise. This is only marginally effective, as blurring occurs in only the \\"x\\" plane. This method of acquiring tomographic images using only mechanical techniques advanced through the mid-twentieth century, steadily producing sharper images, and with a greater ability to vary the thickness of the cross-section being examined. This was achieved through the introduction of more complex, pluridirectional devices that can move in more than one plane and perform more effective blurring. However, despite the increasing sophistication of focal plane tomography, it remained ineffective at producing images of soft tissues. With the increasing power and availability of computers in the 1960s, research began into practical computational techniques for creating tomographic images, leading to the development of computed tomography (CT).

Akbar is recognized as a \\"national hero\\" due to her involvement in the Kuwaiti oil fires which were later depicted in the Academy Award nominated documentary Fires of Kuwait. For her firefighting efforts, she was awarded the Global 500 Roll of Honour from the United Nations Environmental Program. Akbar is one of the first women oil sector company executives from the Arabian Peninsula. She served as the director of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 2007.  Early life and education  Akbar grew up in a large family, including her mother and father, as well as nine brothers and sisters. Her father was an oil driller. She earned her bachelor's degree as part of Kuwait University's first graduating class of Chemical Engineers in 1981.  Career  Akbar began her career working in departmental offices before attaining a position as a petroleum engineer for Kuwait Oil Company. She subsequently worked there in fire-fighting operations, as superintendent of petroleum engineering, and as R&D; specialist. Between 1981 and 1999, Akbar worked in the oil sector at Kuwait Energy, a company she co-founded and served as CEO. She is the first woman to hold a leading position in the Middle East oil and gas industry. During the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, most of the oil wells in the country (80%) were attacked by Saddam Hussein's army. Akbar was the lone woman on a rogue team of petroleum engineers who acted against orders to take on the dangerous task of dousing oil well fires. She believes it was her familiarity with the wells that allowed her team to be successful: \\"I worked on the oilfields, offshore and onshore, day and night, and the result of this work was that I knew the oilfields very well... There were 800 wells and I knew every single one like the back of my hand.\\" Their efforts were later shown in Fires of Kuwait, a 1992 documentary that was nominated for Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. From 2001 to 2005, she was the business development manager of Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company. In 2006, Akbar was behind the creation of oil and gas legislation and regulations in Somalia. She also was a \\"catalyst\\" humanitarian efforts in the country. Under Akbar's direction, Kuwait Energy sponsored approximately \\"two hundred women to start up small business markets...\\" Akbar served as the director-at-large of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in 2007. In January 2018, Akbar became the only woman on the Board of Trustees of the Silk City and Boubyan Island development authority for the project Madinat al-Hareer. She resigned as the CEO of Kuwait Energy in 2017.  Accolades  Akbar's awards include: * Global 500 Roll of Honour - United Nations Environment Programme, 1993 * Distinguished Member - Society of Petroleum Engineers, 2003 * Charles F. Rand Memorial Gold Medal - American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers, 2013 * Leader in Energy - Women in Leadership Awards and Forum, 2009 * WOW Award (Entrepreneurship Award) - New Arab Woman Forum, 2017 * Ranked 46 out of \\"The Top 100 Most Powerful Arab Businesswomen\\" by Forbes  Women's rights  In interviews, Akbar speaks about the role of women in the workplace, especially in Middle Eastern countries. She notes that there is variation between the countries and should not be viewed as equivalent in their advancements of women's rights. Speaking about Kuwait and the women's rights movement, she argues, \\"Kuwait is top of the class in women‚Äôs rights, access to education, business and work. [At the same time], the country remains way behind in terms of political rights, which we finally got four or five years ago. I strongly believe in the 'power of women,' i.e., their ability to fight for what they are entitled to and to finally win the battle. In Kuwait, this movement is quite strong.\\" Akbar does not believe Islam imposes \\"social limits\\" on women, instead, she believes there are larger socio-cultural factors that impact women's rights.  Personal life  Akbar credits parental support as a key factor in her success, as well as the success of her siblings. She is currently married and living in Kuwait City with her husband and three children. Akbar is Muslim.

Zinyoka Community The village of Zinyoka in the Ciskei experienced all of these challenges with rural health clinics scattered approximately 20 kilometres apart. These clinics lacked medical supplies and staff members. Grey Hospital in King William's Town was mostly used for white patients. The hospitals that allowed black people were the Mission Hospital, Mt Coke Mission Hospital and St Matthews Mission which were far away and poorly resourced.

Projects Nontombeko Moletsane initiated a bulk grocery buying scheme. Child mortality decreased after the nutrition of the community improved. She also started a leather factory which provided many of the women with income. Resistance The headman and chief in Zinyoka, Sidoko Sijama, under the chief of Tshatshu, was against the operations of the clinic. Many of the members of the Ciskei government were afraid that this clinic would cause conflict with the authorities. A rival clinic was built but it did not succeed. Other attempts to end the operations of the clinic included withholding the operating licence and not allowing the clinic access to free immunisations for children. Closure Two weeks after the death of Steve Biko, on the 17 October 1977, all black consciousness organisations including the BCPs were banned. Two days after this ban, authorities confiscated all the assets of the clinic. They also destroyed the leather work factory and placed the Zanempilo clinic under government control. Additionally, all clinic programmes were cancelled, it no longer offered 24 hour care, it was not open on weekends, it lost supplies and no longer provided ambulatory services.Leslie Hadfield.

Biography Born in 1894, Edward Lloyd Hyman began his career as a theater manager for the Victoria Theater in his hometown of Buffalo, New York, in 1916. He gained popularity for his elaborate productions of film during the silent era, most notable for his musical accompaniments that included: overtures, prologues, interludes, and countless other vocal and dance numbers. His success at the Victoria not only transferred, but increased when he was hired to work at the prestigious Strand Theatre, Brooklyn in 1920. He was later named the Vice President of Paramount Pictures after their historic merger with the American Broadcasting Company. He was responsible for acquisitions and dealt frequently with Walt Disney Productions. Victoria theatre (1916-1920) Hyman became the manager for the Victoria Theatre in 1916, when he was just 21 years old. As the manager, he gained a positive reputation for actively communicating with his patrons about what films they wished to see the most. From this dialogue with his patrons he was able to construct his programs with the audience's desires in mind, which filled the house to capacity on most nights. He realized that the standard audience member was bored by the routine screening, and thus sought to include a variety of elaborate stage productions with each screening. Here, he first identified the importance of musical accompaniment, and spent the rest of his tenure as manager improving the sonic qualities of film exhibition. He was one of the first exhibitors to treat his orchestra as an integral component of the production. Through discussions with his patrons, Hyman realized that musical performance was one of the most compelling theatrical draws. The sentiment was rather clear, the audience had much more interest in films that featured a strong musical accompaniment. In the past, exhibitors neglected the musical wants of their performers and audience, resulting in an unpleasant atmosphere for both parties. Orchestra members felt they weren't being utilized to their full potential, and audience members were frustrated and distracted by the lackluster performances. Hyman sought to establish a friendly relationship with his orchestra, and increase their role in the exhibition. As a result, the orchestra members produced more enjoyable music that accompanied the on- screen images. Giving the orchestra members a say in exhibition helped enhance the relationship between audio and visual elements in cinema at the time. One innovation Hyman developed at the Victoria related to the exhibition of advertisements. Rather than spend considerable amounts of money on official advertisements, Hyman simply cut out film advertisements featured in Motion Picture News, hired a photographer to take pictures of the cutouts, and then projected these images onto his screen during intermissions. As a result, the Victoria had high-quality previews produced at a fraction of the standard cost. Strand theatre (1920-1927) The Mark Strand theatre is where Hyman first garnished nationwide popularity. He was well known for introducing numerous musical and stage novelties, such as prologues, overtures, light shows, dance numbers, and radio broadcasts. He was very successful at securing popular musicians and dancers to perform at his theatre, namely: Charles Wakefield Cadman, Victor Herbert, Van and Schenck, Ben Bernie, Vincent Lopez, The Happiness Boys, and The Goodrich Silvertown Orchestra. Additionally, immediately following Gertrude Ederle's record breaking swim across the English Channel, Hyman was a key factor in bringing Ederle to the Mark Strand theatre for a personal appearance.Ferguson, Lee. \\"Developments of Screen and Stage Shows Traced in Career of E. L. Hyman\\", Motion Picture News, New York, 7 January 1928. Retrieved on 13 June 2018. =Musical Novelties= Prologues Before the start of his features, Hyman would often produce an elaborate musical or dance number on stage. Prologues were frequently used in theatrical productions, but it was rare for them to be used in conjunction with motion pictures. His productions were universally liked by his patrons, which caused him to realize the importance of music in his programming. Additionally, many silent films were hard to follow, so the prologues helped explain the plot to the audience. Pictures of his prologues are included below along with original text published in the Exhibitor's Trade Review. \\"Again only two performers were used by Hyman to produce a Gypsy scene in conjunction with First National's \\"The Midnight Bell\\"\\" \\"Hyman used a Russian ballet with appropriate setting to exploit \\"Wedding Bells\\"\\" \\"Edward Hyman, of the Strand, Brooklyn, used only two people and a special drop to prologue \\"Experience\\". The scene is a duplicate from the film\\" Overtures Different from a prologue, an overture also takes place at the beginning of a film, but refers to the piece of music played before the opening credits. Overtures originated in European operas, but Hyman and other exhibitors adopted this practice to set the mood of their motion picture for their audience. Stanley Corporation (1928-1937) In 1928, Hyman was promoted by the Stanley Corporation (a now defunct movie theater chain) to manage their theaters in Richmond, Baltimore, and Washington D.C., in addition to the Brooklyn Mark Strand. During his time with this motion picture chain, Hyman was active in film acquisition, securing performers, and in implementing up-to-date musical and cinematic innovations.Ferguson, Lee. \\"Developments of Screen and Stage Shows Traced in Career of E. L. Hyman\\", Motion Picture News, New York, 7 January 1928. Retrieved on 13 June 2018. The Stanley Corporation was purchased by Warner Bros. later on in 1928. At the time, The Stanley Corporation owned one-third of the shares in rival film company, First National Pictures. This purchase reduced competition and enabled Warner to gain further control of the market. Paramount pictures (1941-1965) \\"Edward L. Hyman, formerly of United Detroit Theatres, Paramount Affiliate, takes possession of his new desk in the Paramount home office where he will be associated with Sam Dembrow and Leonard Goldenson\\". After he resigned from his position with the now defunct Stanley Corporation, Hyman briefly continued to write publications for trade journals. Shortly after his resignation, Hyman joined United Detroit Theatres, an affiliate of Paramount. In 1941, he became affiliated with Paramount Pictures directly. Paramount operated both a theater chain and production studio until 1948, when the supreme court ruling United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. made it illegal for a single company to hold exclusive distribution rights. =Merger Between American Broadcasting Company and United Paramount Theatres= In 1949, during the eighth year of Hyman's tenure with Paramount, the company completed a merger with the American Broadcasting Company. He was named the Vice President of the company in the following year. The company experienced great economic success after the merger, and was purchased by Capital Cities in 1985 for $3.5 billion in a monumental deal financed by Warren Buffett. =Vice President of American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. (1949-1965)= Following the merger, Edward Hyman was named the Vice President of AB-PT. As the VP, Hyman was responsible for identifying the most valuable films held by distributors, and connecting them with theaters in a timely fashion. He held the position until he retired in 1965, at the age of 71.

It is a Grade II* listed building and a Scheduled Ancient Monument and no longer carries vehicular traffic. The bridge played a role in the Battle of Flodden in 1513. History Twizel Bridge was built in 1511, when it provided the only dry crossing over the River Till between its confluence with the River Tweed and the village of Etal some 5 miles (8 kilometres) to the southeast. It was the longest stone span of any bridge in England for three centuries. Local legend suggests that it was built by a lady of the Selby family, whose seat was Twizell Castle nearby. The bridge is described by the antiquary Francis Grose in his \\"The Antiquities of England and Wales\\" as \\"Twisle Bridge of Stone, one bow, but greate and stronge\\". On the morning of 9 September 1513, the English army commanded by Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey undertook a march northwards to outflank the invading Scottish army commanded by James IV of Scotland, which was encamped at Flodden Hill. The English artillery train and vanguard under Edmund Howard crossed the Till at Twizel Bridge, while the main English force crossed by fords and smaller bridges upstream. By making this manoeuvre, Surrey forced King James to abandon his secure position on Flodden Hill and the resulting battle that afternoon was fought on ground which was disadvantageous to the Scottish tactics and contributed to their defeat.Hallam-Baker (2012), pp. 147-148 Alterations in 1770 and 1820 added small flood arches and a rebuilt parapet with a decorative dentil cornice.

The event took place on August 22, 1993 at the Hankyu Nishinomiya Stadium in Nishinomiya, Hy≈çgo, Japan. Thirteen matches were contested at the event. In the main event, Atsushi Onita defeated Mr. Pogo in a no ropes exploding barbed wire time bomb cage deathmatch to win the new FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship, which replaced the WWA World Martial Arts Heavyweight Championship. Background Mr. Pogo left W*ING as FMW had offered him an annual salary of $120,000, and he returned to FMW in June 1993 by attacking Atsushi Onita after a match and then quickly escaped in a car. The two men renewed their rivalry and Pogo joined Team Canada. On July 16, Pogo made his in-ring return to FMW with Big Titan and The Gladiator against Onita, Sambo Asako and Tarzan Goto in a street fight, which Pogo's team won. Onita defeated Pogo in a no ropes exploding barbed wire double hell deathmatch on July 24, which was the first singles encounter between the two since 1991 and a rematch was set up between the two at Summer Spectacular. Onita vacated his WWA World Martial Arts Heavyweight Championship as FMW's martial arts style had ended and FMW completely shifted to deathmatch wrestling style. Martial arts was limited only to kickboxer Katsuji Ueda's exhibition matches. The title was replaced by the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship, which would represent FMW's deathmatch competition and the title would be decided in Onita and Pogo's match. Onita combined his barbed wire cage match against Tarzan Goto from the 2nd Anniversary Show and the exploding ring time bomb stipulation against Terry Funk from the 4th Anniversary Show to make the first-ever no ropes exploding ring barbed wire time bomb cage deathmatch against Pogo at Summer Spectacular. Event =Preliminary matches= In the opening match, Masato Tanaka defeated the aging 60-year old Mr. Chin with a cradle. Koji Nakagawa took on Chiaki Matsuyama in a very quick match which ended when Nakagawa applied a half Boston crab on Matsuyama for the submission victory.

Megumi Kudo and Miwa Sato took on All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling's (AJW) Jungle Jack members Aja Kong and Kaoru Ito. Kong initially overpowered Kudo and almost knocked her out but Kudo managed to get up at the referee's count of 9 and then performed a Kudo Driver to win the match for FMW. The Great Sasuke, Battle Ranger Z and TAKA Michinoku defeated Jinsei Shinzaki, Super Delfin and Gran Naniwa when Ranger performed a dragon suplex on Naniwa. The team of Sambo Asako and Mr. Gannosuke took on Team Canada's Big Titan and The Gladiator. Both teams brawled all over the stadium and then continued to fight over a scaffold. Gannosuke pinned Gladiator with a Gannosuke Clutch. Leon Spinks took on kickboxer Katsuji Ueda in a different style fight. After a back and forth contest, Ueda knocked out Spinks in the third round. The Sheik and Sabu took on Terry Funk and Tarzan Goto. Near the end of the match, Funk performed a Piledriver to Sabu on a steel chair to knock Sabu out and get the win. =Main event match= Atsushi Onita took on Mr. Pogo in the first-ever no ropes exploding barbed wire time bomb cage deathmatch for the new FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. Pogo controlled the earlier part of the match by tossing Onita into the exploding cage and then carved his back with his sickle. Pogo attempted to throw a fireball into Onita but Onita moved out of it and the fire struck Pogo and then Onita tried to throw Pogo into the exploding cage but Pogo grabbed the referee Go Ito and both men fell into the cage and were knocked out with the explosions. Onita capitalized by performing two DDTs but Pogo still kicked out of the pinfall attempt and then Onita delivered a third DDT to win the title. After the match, the clock ticked and the ring exploded with Onita putting himself over Ito to protect Ito from getting blowed. Reception Summer Spectacular was a huge success as the event drew a crowd of 36,223, breaking the highest attendance record of Osaka. The event earned the company a revenue of $1,600,000.

Pogo gained more allies as Mitsuhiro Matsunaga and Hideki Hosaka left W*ING to join FMW and Hisakatsu Oya from Super World of Sports (SWS) also joined FMW as Pogo's ally. Onita defended the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship against Matsunaga in a No Ropes Exploding Barbed Wire Deathmatch at Year End Spectacular, with Onita retaining the title and then both men made peace with each other. Pogo ultimately defeated Onita to win the title on January 6, 1994.

Article dated 11 March 2011, retrieved 14 April 2015. is the main exhibit of the museum. It depicts the Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 on 1,000 square metres of canvas. Another focal point of the Tyrol Panorama is the permanent exhibition called the ‚ÄúTyrolean Stage‚Äù (\\"Schauplatz Tirol\\"). Here, the themes of religion, nature, politics and man will be used to explain the \\"Tyrolean myth\\" by using exhibits. Furthermore, the new house is connected underground to the Kaiserj√§ger Museum, which is a \\"museum within the museum\\". The exhibition area is visually divided into four thematic areas. ‚ÄúNature‚Äù is presented in a 40-metre-long showcase in which, among other things, a cable car gondola and stuffed animals, such as a bear and a beaver, are exhibited. ‚ÄúPolitics\\" is located in the middle of the room, where, for example, the horse's head of the so-called \\"Aluminum Duce\\" monument in Bolzano or the valuable 1511 ‚Äò‚ÄôLandlibell‚Äô‚Äô of Emperor Maximilian I are found. Interactive \\"tree trunks\\" show the \\"man\\" or \\"Tyrolean types\\". Here you can also find, for example, the pipe of former provincial governor, Eduard Walln√∂fer, or a self-portrait of the painter, Anna Stainer-Knittel. The exhibits on \\"Religion\\" are housed in large glass showcases at the back of the main entrance foyer to the Kaiserj√§ger Museum.

History and controversies  On the initiative of the former governor of Tyrol, Herwig van Staa, the museum was originally to be opened in 2009 on the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Bergisel. Its construction costs were estimated at six million euros, but this was significantly exceeded, at over 25 million euros. It was opened on 12 March 2011 as part of a large celebration. The opening was attended by 6,500 people. This led to a flash mob initiated by alternative groups to draw attention to the alleged lack of cultural support from the state of Tyrol. The initial reception for the Tyrol Panorama was positive however: 50,000 visitors were received in just the first 2¬Ω months.orf.at - Positive Erstbilanz f√ºr das Tirol Panorama.

Many critics of the transfer of the circular painting also changed their opinion and are now convinced by the new location.Tiroler Kronen Zeitung, 30 May 2011 The relocation of the giant circular painting had already been criticized by the Federal Monuments Office and International Panorama Council as being unjustifiable from the point of view of the protection of the ensemble. The Federal Ministry for Education, Art and Culture, on the other hand, judged the transfer of the giant circular painting into the Tyrol Panorama as a better conservation solution. Some critics have described parts of the exhibition as an arbitrary hotchpotch of exhibits. In addition, the lack of transport connections and procedures for leasing the attached restaurant were also criticised. On the occasion of a visit on 3 July 2011, Claudia Schmied, Federal Minister of Education, Art and Culture said: \\"The giant painting has now found an ideal location.\\" She was pleased that \\"the large and not uncontroversial project had now come to such a successful conclusion.\\"Tiroler Tageszeitung, dated 4 July 2011  References  The \\"Iron Edelwei√ü\\", a 1915 battle shield by Adolph Johannes Fischer displayed in the ‚ÄúTirol Panorama‚ÄùPress photography by Adolph Johannes Fischer Wehrschild in the exhibition area of \\"Tiroler Kaisersch√ºtzen\\" Horst Christoph: Unrundgem√§lde.

Magistrate of Jiangsu, he lost and then regained rank during the Taiping rebellion to become Shanghai intendant before returning to the devastated Jiangsu in 1867 as Finance Commissioner and then Province Governor from 1868-1870. Often compared with famous reformer Zeng Guofan, whose writings Ding became familiar with while serving under a staff advised by him, Ding's lengthy 1868 memorial admits to the hopelessness of effective governance without qualified administrators and structural reform, and in spite of his constant vigilance, corruption by the yamen continued throughout his term, remaining a central issue. Li Hongzhang relied on Ding for advice on Western military technology, and as Shanghai intendant Ding founded the Kiangnan Arsenal, to which was attached a language school and translation department. It's 200 works had a powerful influence in the modernization of China. He also founded the Lung-m√™n shu-yuan Academy in Shanghai, which would be reorganized as a normal school in 1904.; In his late years he presided over Taiwan during one of the \\"most dynamic periods\\" of its history, and the program he laid there is relatable to that of the Self-Strengthening Movement.; Despite his reformist propositions and support of Western learning, Ding was strongly committed to Confucianism and opposed the spread of Western religion. However, despite his concern for the former, unlike contemporary censors he was open to the flourishing Buddhist religion.;  Early career  Born in Fengshun County, Ding was able to attend school in his childhood at a local temple even though his family was not rich, becoming a licentiate and then earning a stipend for distinction in the annual prefectural examination. Becoming known for his talents in writing, Fengshun's magistrate accepted him as prot√©g√©, and an unidentified sponsor paid the expense of the provincial Canton examination. He obtained the rank of student at the Imperial academy at 20, possibly purchased for him by the same, but was never able to master the more abstruse arts of the provincial examination. After failing the 1845 examination he became a teacher and secretary to local officials, purchasing the rank of an expectant director of schools. In 1854 he was rewarded with the rank of an expectant magistrate for help in subduing local bandits, and in 1856 was appointed subdirector of schools of Qiongzhou (Hainan Island), and magistrate of Jiangsu three years later at the age of thirty-five, a typical age to become magistrate. As magistrate Ding controlled corruption in Jiangsu through strict supervision of his subordinates. His swift policies were praised by the Wan-an gazetteer, and it is said that he reduced the number of backlogged cases from over a hundred to only a few within a month. He also began reconstruction of the academy and city temple, which had been destroyed by Taiping rebels. Departing for Guangdong in 1859 to work in foreign affairs, the people of Wan-an petitioned for his return.;  Military Secretariat and Shanghai Intendant  Ting was Soon made acting magistrate of Ji'an during the Taiping rebellion, with the goal of recapturing the county seat of Chi'an. He succeeded but lost his rank and office after then losing Ji'an to the retreating Taiping rebels in 1861 (though he and his superiors recovered it). Invited to join Zeng Guofan's secretariat in Anhwei, Ding's expertise in foreign affairs bought him favour. Following this he supervised firearms manufacturing in Guangdong. His services in both instances would see his rank restored to him in 1862, and considering him essential the governor-general was twice successful in petitioning the court to prevent his leaving for summons to perform the same in Jiangsu, as part of Li Hongzhang's secretariat. Following his service on Hong's secretariat, Hong recommended Ding for prefect, which he was awarded, stressing Ding's role during the campaign that recovered Jiangsu. Ding was soon awarded Shanghai taotai (intendant of Suzhou, Songjiang and Taicang), which entailed constant foreign dealings, for his diplomatic handling of staff negotiations in the disbandment of the Ever Victorious Army. Going over regular channels, Ding succeeded in acquiring the appointment of a former British officer (William Winstanley) from the Ever Victorious Army for his new unit, much to the chagrin of the British authorities in Shanghai.; ; ; As Shanghai taotai, on the basis of treaties he believed the Chinese should honour, he rejected the petitions of Chinese merchants to ban foreign cotton-goods shops, and with difficulty persuaded the inhabitants of Chaozhou to accept foreign entry. On the same basis he rejected American real-estate interests in Shanghai and British steamship traffic. In 1863 he promised to reduce taxes on Chinese junks so as to make them competitive with foreign ships (apparently in bean trade), and wrote to Li Hongzhang suggesting that the Chinese buy and build steamships, which, allowing them to outcompete the foreigners, would remove the need to expel them by force. His proposal was accepted, but 1864 reports by him memorialize China as being surrounded by enemies, and still demonstrates a clear commitment to ordnance. In 1865, in response to a need by Li Hongzhang and the Yamen for formal training in mechanics and mathematics, he purchased (as an administrator) machinery from a foreign factory at Shanghai, founding the Kiangnan Arsenal. It incorporated Li's previous two Arsenals. Li was promoted to salt controller in September 1865 before being named the Jiangsu finance commissioner in early 1866, which he performed in 1867.; ; ; ; During this time he issued his first lengthy proclamation, which called for better personnel training and selection, examinations, increased reward and punishment, longer terms and higher salaries. He also made an argument for sending diplomats overseas. Jiangsu Governorship Receiving Governorship in 1868, Ding took to referring to himself as a \\"man up from the fields\\" in letters to the Emperor, and sent letters of reprimand to his subordinates that had they been commoners and secretaries they would neither be so insensitive nor incompetent. However, apparently unsure of the use of his authority, his words had more sting than his actions. Though avoiding involving them in government he cultivated relationships with local scholar-elites through book- lending from his personal library. Continuing an effort he had made during the war, Ding used his position in Jiangsu to purchase books from destitute Chinese for cataloguing by a subordinate, later writing a more complete catalogue from his home - and inspiring a third by the commissioner of education, Chiang Piao.; Ding established free schools and lectures, reprinting the Expanded Sacred Edicts, subsidized fertilizer, and pressed for repair of waterworks. On the penal side of things he drew up plans in late 1868 for weapon's collection to combat piracy, which was successful, attempted to ban delayed burial, and closed some twenty nunneries supposedly used as brothels. He rebuilt temples and banned religious processions as attracting undesirables, and suppressed gambling. He halted the construction of theatres, though he was unable to exert control over the profession. Although closing urban dens, his campaign against opium was less successful. His efforts against forced remarriage, including an aid association for widows, were unsuccessful. However, Ding's chief effort in Suzhou (southern Jiangsu) was to improve the tax-collection process. In contrast with his predecessor Feng Guifen, who considered taxes too high even after reduction, Ding considered irregularity the primary problem with the tax administration (while still needing to not overburden the peasants). To accomplish this, using earlier plans earlier proposed by Feng, he simultaneously lightened taxes while establishing norms in the handling of taxes in collection and accounting, uniform conversion rates, and enforcement, using his powers as governor while trying to persuade the central government. Ding's efforts hinged on control over clerks and runners. While he probably would have preferred the complete restructuring proposed by Feng, he settled for a few of his more important ideas. His 1868 memorial to the throne proposed limiting clerk positions to non-degree holding scholars (rather than any semi-literate) on the basis that they might value their reputation more. Though not holding a degree they would still have to pass a series of examinations, and would be re-examined every year. To make the position attractive, in addition to comfortable emoluments they could eventually become regular bureaucrats this way. His proposal was not accepted, probably on account of more pressing expenses and entrenched interests. During this time he focused his efforts on bringing his local clerks under the supervision of magistrates, improving the latter's selection and establishing channels of communication between them and the peasants. To a large extent these measures consisted in enforcing already present regulations that in the past had only been enforced on their being broken. He made a warning and executed those runners involving in banditry. In-order to prevent over-collection, he developed to a high degree the publication of all tax information that peasants would need to know. Following this he made efforts to continually supervise and penalize the magistrates themselves. To counterbalance the magistrates (that is, the yamen) he made it so the headmen had to be selected from among village elders, given a travel allowance for reporting, and hopefully being less inclined to extortion made them responsible for local tax-collection. He enforced (and in some cases instituted) responsibility on the magistrates for tax-receipts, and simplified procedures.; He tried to curb litigation, which was expensive. Ding kept tabs on northern Jiangsu (Kiangpei) through secret agents. However, apart from directives he didn't attempt to reform Kiangpei personally, likely considering the impoverished and unruly region beyond his capacity. Though southern Jiangsu (Suzhou) was recovering from the war, it also had an element in the imperial court and an economic diversity that attracted patrons in wealth, commerce and the arts. Fujian Governorship Ding attended Taiwan in 1869, and with Imperial sanction reduced the number of the Green Standard Army stationed there. He desired to seriously reform it as a new standard for Jiangsu, but had to leave in 1870 on account of the death of his mother (however, the throne did reform the Green Standard Army on the basis of Zeng Guofan's plan). That same year he participated in the trial for the Tianjin Massacre. He otherwise retired for the next four years, returning to Tianjin in 1875 to conclude treaties with Japan and Peru. In response to the Japanese invasion, during the great policy debates he proposed the need for Western studies and three regional fleets worth of ironclad battleships. He was attacked by the Literati (though they accepted his proposal to send Li Hongzhang to negotiate treaties with Korea) but supported by Li and made director of the Fuzhou Arsenal and governor of Fujian three months later. Having propounded a pro-colonial stance to the court in the past, during his term he gave much attention to Taiwan. He witnessed the first machine excavation of coal there and oversaw the installation of the first telegraph line in China. He also installed artillery at the forts and inspected the Green Standard Army, dismissing ten officers for corruption. He laid plans for commercial farming and mining, and naval base and a railway (for military purposes), which were approved by the throne, but not did receive funds. Ding tried to root out corruption in the Fujian officialdom but was continually blocked by his subordinates. Growing ill and disillusioned with the possibility of innovation in Taiwan he submitted his resignation, which the throne accepted in April 1878. Following Ding's resignation he was called upon several times to settle cases involving foreigners. Submitting a number of memorials on foreign affairs, in 1879 he was given the titles of Foreign Affairs and Governor General of the defenses of South China, which, together with soliciting funds for the Shanxi famine, occupied him until his death in 1882. He was afforded typical posthumous honours. Ding's successor in Taiwan, Governor Liu Mingchuan, was given more financial support, and a portion of the railway was begun from 1887-1891, while Liu's successor completed another two- thirds before it was finished in the early 1900s.; ; ; Character Professor Jonathan K. Ocko considers Ding a Confucian moralist, prudish but also upright. He strictly adhered to his own teachings, as well as Confucian custom down to the most banal detail. Though quoted as saying \\"Taoism to rule the people, Legalism the clerks\\", he only reluctantly issued demerits, considering quick reform unreasonable and punishments impotent. He demonstrated willingness to employ unlawful practices if effective or benefiting the people, for instance, in using beggars as substitutes for runners. Zeng Guofan considered him an evasive if charming fame-seeker, but some of Ding‚Äôs sarcasm may have been lost on magistrates that, in the first place, may have been as confused as Ding believed. He was easily perturbed by a disregard for his orders, and sensitive about the performance of officials he had personally appointed.

History  The site of Hampshire House was originally the site of an eight-building housing cooperative complex called Navarro Flats, which was built from 1882 to 1884. At the time, Central Park South contained a multitude of high-class apartment buildings. However, Navarro Flats was not successful, and it closed by the 1920s. Hampshire House was first planned at the site in 1926, and was built as two parts. The first portion was a 13-story building at 145 West 58th Street with of frontage, which opened in 1929. The second part, consisting of a taller portion with of frontage on Central Park South, was delayed due to the Great Depression in the United States. The Central Park South building was envisioned as a narrow tower with a dome, but the plans were changed to a 36-story apartment hotel in the Regency and Art Deco styles. Construction of the $6 million Hampshire House was delayed until January 1931. The structure was done by July 1931. but the building's developers ran out of money and the interior design and roof was not completed. New York Title and Mortgage, who had lent $2.2 million to the developers, started to foreclose on the property but went into receivership itself, and its receivers spent $1.5 million to complete the Hampshire House.

She breaks taboos and attacks traditional gender roles with the woman figures in her cartoons. She was honored with the Creative Courage Award in 2017. Early years Ramize Erer was born in Kƒ±rklareli, Turkey in 1963, the fourth of five children of a bookkeeper father and a housewife mother. She spent her childhood at her grandparents' home in Kƒ±rklareli, and her adolescence in Istanbul. While there, she spent the summer holidays with her siblings in Kƒ±rklareli, where she tried to copy the landscape paintings on the wall of her grandparents' home. Illustrations in the novel Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens impressed Erer. She studied painting at the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, and graduated in 1990. During her adolescence, Erer read feminist literature. It helped her feel stronger and understand that she shared similar experiences with other women. Cartooning career At the age of 16, she started drawing cartoons for the weekly humor magazine Gƒ±rgƒ±r, produced by Oƒüuz Aral a famous Turkish cartoonist. She published her first book Bir Bƒ±yƒ±ksƒ±z (A Mustache) in 1990. She became known particularly for her cartoon character K√∂t√º Kƒ±z (The Bad Girl) created in 1999. After six months at the Turkish daily newspaper Cumhuriyet she was fired, as they found her cartoons obscene. She published cartoons with K√∂t√º Kƒ±z for more than ten years in the Turkish daily Radikal, while she created the character T√ºp√ß√º (The Propane-bottle Delivery Man) for the magazine Feminist Pazartesi (The Feminist Monday). When the Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark caused a sensation and fierce debates around the world, she took a keen interest in the Cartooning for Peace international traveling exhibition of the United Nations Regional Information Centre, highlighting her position on the dispute over the cartoons saying that \\"satire needs freedom.\\" In addition to her work in newspapers, Erer drew cartoons for the humor magazines Hƒ±bƒ±r and LeMan. In March 2011, she was one of the founders of the feminist humor magazine Bayan Yani, the only comic in the world designed exclusively by women. She continued to run it from Paris during her exile after threats were made against her in Turkey. Her cartoons about the Gezi Park protests in Istanbul in May 2013 were particularly popular. Over the course of her career, Erer has drawn or illustrated more than ten thousand cartoons and stories. Erer is married to another cartoonist, and is the mother of a son and a daughter. Criticism Erer admits that \\"her mother gave her something, which other mothers feared to give to their daughters: freedom.\\" She observed her mother's female friends in gatherings at home, and the girls she met in the streets of Istanbul during her high school years. She liked the theme of the song Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere), and simply preferred the latter. The inspiration for her sharp-edged cartoons comes from her visits to the beauty parlor in the Cihangir neighborhood of Istanbul, where she lives. The hair salon is a meeting place where gossip is shared. Belgian-Israeli cartoonist Michel Kichka (born 1954) comments that \\"she is a mix of the Belgian school and French comics creator Jean-Marc Reiser (1941‚Äì1983).\\" He adds that \\"her designs inevitably suggest American sitcoms.\\" Her \\"bad girls\\" wear hot pants and act freely. Her novelist friend Vivet Kanetti says that \\"her cartoon characters are very hedonistic, and expose their femininity and body fat without inferiority complexes.\\" Her Turkish colleague ƒ∞zel Rozental criticized her cartoons, saying \\"the background does not change much: two or at most three people are sitting on a sofa or a bed, chatting or talking loudly about sex or their relationships.\\" She adds that \\"it is sometimes shocking even though we have been familiar with her cartoons for twenty years.\\" Erer says that when she published a cartoon of a masturbating girl, a first in the Turkish press, \\"all hell broke loose.\\" French cartoonist Georges Wolinski (1934‚Äì2015) of Charlie Hebdo said \\"he admires 'the girls mooning and kidding around with males' of the impertinent cartoonist, who attacks the Turkish community and particularly the relationship between men and women.\\" He emphasized \\"she is a real sister,\\" and had offered \\"endless friendship and support\\" to her and her family. On the occasion of the publication of her cartoon book in Germany in 2008, the German weekly news magazine Stern wrote \\"she is one of the few Turkish cartoonists who are invariably critical of the role of women in their country. She breaks taboos and scourges the traditional gender roles with a strong dash of irony and cynicism, addressing adultery and bigamy, homosexuality and bisexuality, often reaching the limits of tolerance.\\" The Stern commented, \\"for millions of Turkish women, she has become a cult‚Äîbecause she expresses what many Turkish women think, but do not dare, publicly to stand by: for social equality and recognition.\\" Painting career In 2007, Erer moved with her 10-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter to Paris, France. She took up painting again, and was invited to take part in a group exhibition at the Kuad Gallery in Istanbul after she attracted the attention of curator Beral Madra.

Puritans, Native Americans, and people coming from the Caribbean and across the Atlantic, were the three largest groups in the region, the latter of these being smaller in proportion to the first two. Puritan communities were characteristically strict, religious, and in constant development. The separate colonies that formed around Massachusetts and Rhode Island began as centralized towns that expanded quickly during the seventeenth century. In native society, before the introduction of Europeans, the roles occupied by women and men were divided along lines of class and gender, and were generally more egalitarian than in Puritan society. Native women after the introduction of European social, legal, and religious beliefs adapted to and in some my within their indigenous tribe. The often overlooked and sparsely recorded account of women who arrived as slaves and free people from the Caribbean is difficult to pinpoint because almost every written record of their lives is from the perspective of white, male elites and slave owners, who treated the women and men they owned as property.  Colonial English women in 17th Century New England  English colonists in the everyday life of Puritan society dealt with many of the same realities. Over the course of the seventeenth century in New England, English settlements grew rapidly from about 1620 onward. The common assumption that Puritan society was homogeneous holds some truth, but this was not the case in matters of wealth. As communities became more established, people naturally accumulated more material possessions, and those differed in quality from family to family. This makes sense, as little physical money circulated in the early colonies, making tangible objects both proof of wealth and status. One example of this early disparity comes from a recorded inventory from 1652 of one William Pontus whose land, house, and furnishings were valued at thirteen pounds. Yet in 1654, the estate of ‚ÄúMiss Ann Attwood‚Äù recorded the ownership of eighteen table clothes and sixty-six cloth napkins, her other assets not included. Other than suggesting that fabrics, too, played a part in one's show of wealth, this comparison is rather extreme, but clearly illustrates a major force that impacted daily life in places like Plymouth Colony. However, the actual function of social norms outweighed wealth when it came to personal roles and interactions. = Social structure = Puritan society was overwhelmingly male dominated, which was reflected in just about every area of public life. Women could not own property independently, and therefore could not vote, a privilege that was awarded to ‚Äúfreemen‚Äù, or men when owned property. Women were excluded from enacting laws, serving in courts, creating taxes, and supervising land distribution, all of which were government functions. The role of religion was also divided by gender, since nearly every English person living in New England was Christian in some form. Yet in this area, women were also seen as lesser to God than men were. Men were inferior to God and women were inferior to men, so went the logic of social hierarchy. The average lifespan of a seventeenth century English woman in New England who made it to her twenty-first year was about 63. This age was about seven years less than the male average, and is often considered by historians to be a result of childbirth, although this claim is not widely agreed upon. Private life, if it can truly be considered private in the context of Puritan norms, was much different than public life. In a frontier society like early New England, communities were centralized organizations with strict social norms that were upheld consistently, making privacy for sexual and economic matters basically non-existent. The essential unit of a home was the nuclear family. From marriage to death, assuming no premature occurrence of the latter, it was critical to the survival of a family group that wife, husband, and children live together. Married women in these settings typically underwent a time of about twenty years in which they reared children in addition to the obligations of daily work. The work of a married Puritan woman was centered around domestic settings, and often was very laborious, especially in early New England. In practice, a wife and mother would be responsible for all the housework, cooking, and cleaning. But women would also trade food commodities in addition to helping each other with birth as midwives or companions. When permanent settlements were built and began to expand, ‚ÄúEuropean Women, a scarce commodity, seldom stayed single long in early New England‚Ä¶‚Äù. Although a few decades after the initial settlements in New England, there were more women generally around as birth rates rose. = Women and law = When personal disputes between members of Puritan communities occurred, there was a chance that the disagreement, if it proved serious enough, would be brought to court by one of the involved parties. Since women were excluded from court, but not the law, they were obligated to attend trials in the case that they also broke common law. In Northampton, Massachusetts, in 1634, the town's court records include a dispute between Maria Drew and Joan Butler. Maria's husband, Edward, having heard of the altercation from two other men in town, ‚Äúpreferred a complaint against Joan Butler, for calling his wife a common carted ass‚Äù. Whatever Joan Butler may have exactly said about Maria Drew's character, she was found guilty and had to apologize and pay a small fine to Drew. But the sentence she received was different than in other disputes. Earlier in the same year, in an apparent disagreement over debt, a woman named Agnes Williams sued the widow that she had previously been ‚Äúattending to in her confinement‚Äù, winning 18 hens instead of the proposed 12 that the ‚Äúwidow Hollens‚Äù had intended to pay. In this disagreement, there were no exchanges of personal insults, which might add to the reason why, unlike with Drew and Butler, the sentence in this case was not as harsh. The comparison of these two altercations suggests a young society that placed a great deal of emphasis on order and continuity. = Social sway = Women were particularly adept at using societal roles to their favor. The lack of privacy in any given community made personal information valuable knowledge. Puritans valued sex for procreation as a tool to ‚Äúgauge moral quality‚Äù over any other functions. Living in England during the early seventeenth century, they were very critical of pre-marital sex. ‚Äú‚Ä¶the boundary between illicit and licit sex was crossed once a couple became committed to each other.‚Äù Pre-marital sex with intent to marry was allowed, and even when a woman was pregnant out of wedlock it was acceptable if the same man was later married to her. Marriage was very important as it contributed to overall themes of social stability and procreation. Indeed, ‚Äúgiven that matrimony provided the only officially authorized context for a sexual union, controversy over marital formation and dissolution had profound implications for sexual politics, in local communities as well as in county courts and legislative assemblies.‚Äù Thus, the personal was public, and privacy almost non-existent.  Native American women in 17th Century New England  Prior to the arrival of English settlers, Native American women lived much in the same way they had within their respective tribes for centuries. As in English society, indigenous women were ascribed specific roles in their communities. Depending on the tribe, women were usually responsible for ‚Äúcooking, preserving foods, or making household utensils and furniture.‚Äù In most cases, a woman lived around other women in close groups within a community, unconfined to the central unit of a heterosexual couple, as in English society. They were responsible for growing and cultivating crops, most notably maize, where it was common for women to claim and use land that her mother had left her. Their work in organizing food sources accounted for up to 75 percent of the average person's annual diet. = Marriage = The concept of marriage in Native American society differed from the English version in ceremony and meaning to the point where the term ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù would be inappropriate as a reference to long-term relationships. In contrast to the living practices of English settlers, it would not have been uncommon to see more elastic relationships in Native society. The appearance of youthful sexual experimentation, ‚Äúdivorce‚Äù, and less often polygamy would have been relatively normal. In the case of polygamy, it was often true that men with higher political standing in the tribe would be the central demographic who took multiple wives. This practice also had an added diplomatic incentive caused by the need to unite two tribes, so one tribal leader, or sachem, could marry his son to another sachem's daughter, thus furthering the union between the two tribes. In some cases, a sachem might take multiple wives who were higher-ranking members of other tribes, which reinforced the common practice of confederation building between neighboring tribes. = Major Native American Federations = The tribes of New England referred to their people broadly as Ninnuock, which means ‚Äúthe people‚Äù and consisted of seven principle tribal confederations. These were the Mahican and Mohegan, Nipmuck groups, the Pequots, the Sokoki, the Abenaki, and the Pennacook. These broader groups were constantly in flux and challenging one another for local dominance. For example, of the Nipmuck confederation located in Eastern Massachusetts, were the Pocasset, one of many tribes in the area, whose lands reached down to northern Rhode Island. When the Europeans arrived, their leader, Sagamore Conbitant, was distrustful of the settler's intentions, and his early feeling later proved to be right. After he died, his daughter Weetamoo succeeded him as leader. Later she married one of Massasoits sons, bringing both their social ranks higher, and strengthening tribal bonds. = European effects on Native Women = Indigenous people in New England during the seventeenth century were living at a time when their historic land and way of life was being steadily eroded by European settlements and customs. For women like Sarah Ahhaton who lived during the mid-seventeenth century, being a native woman in the overlapping European and Native societies was an ongoing culture clash. In spring of 1668, she lived in a small town inhabited by Christian Native Americans. When her husband William, who was the chief's son, brought charges against her with the local court, the two had already been married for ten years. Yet in the past two years, Sarah had been seen flirting with another man, known as Joseph, who was also married. Even though it was observed by the community that William had previously struck Sarah, her husband's offense became the prevailing charge, and she was ordered to no longer be left alone with Joseph. Weeks later, she and Joseph disobeyed the court ordered and fled to his mother's house a few miles away. Eventually she returned home, but as her actions will show, refused to stop seeing Joseph. Finally, after having been alleged to consummating relations with Joseph, she fled from her tribe. Sarah's story is somewhat unique but offers insight into the clear differences between each society's norms. Her answers in court, although morally superior to her husbands, were ignored as would likely have been among white settlers. The social prominence of her and her husband likely made their story a hot piece of gossip in their small community.  Women who arrived from across the Atlantic to 17th Century New England  Most scholars agree that the first slave ship to New England, the Desire, arrived in 1638, bringing with it some of the first people of African descent to set foot in Boston. Hundreds of individuals followed the initial captives, having been captured or purchased as part of the African and Caribbean slave trade. Their story is often overlooked in the study of history, even though they were one of the three unique and diverse ethnic groups in the early colonies. Yet an understanding of the lives of women in New England who came from African or Caribbean origins and lived during the seventeenth century first requires looking to larger societal interactions that were taking place. Modern conceptions of enslavement differ slightly from the seventeenth century, where ‚ÄúPuritans also used ‚Äúslavery‚Äù to describe prisoners of war and criminals, and the term functioned as a rhetorical device to indicate dissatisfaction with government or authority. Still, slavery meant someone who was clearly subjugated, or ‚Äúone who is the property of, and entirely subject to, another person, whether by capture, purchase, or birth; a servant completely divested of freedom and personal rights.‚Äù These two definitions, although somewhat paradoxical together, accurately describe the reality of early New England's first non-white or non-native inhabitants. To be sure, many were slaves, and some were not. Determining what life was like for women of African or West Indian descent is difficult because few if any of them left behind personal accounts. The abundance of primary sources left by Europeans offers the most comprehensive view into the lives of the region's non-white residents. Legal records are crucial to understating official stances that colonies maintained on human rights and crime, as the choices and practices of New England's courts reflect broader societal norms. As Twombley et al. summarized, ‚ÄúThe Puritans did not hold advanced racial views but they did place a high priority on the universality of justice.‚Äù The emphasis in Puritan society on order is exemplified by the judicial actions they enforced. Desire for prosperity was valued so highly by the early colonies that ensuring their stable continuity took priority over most other issues. The result being that a person's religious beliefs were more likely to receive negative attention than their race. Hence, of the 245 penalties recorded by the court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony between 1630 and 1641, 121 were remitted at least partially if not in full. As author Jules Zanger notes, the cause of remittances as originating from ‚Äú‚Ä¶the significance Puritan authorities attached to confession and repentance [that] was in great part responsible for many of the remissions granted...‚Äù One takeaway here is that non-white people probably stood a better chance of fitting in if they were Christian.

They are extracellular fibers located on bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella. These fibers serve to promote cell community behavior through biofilm formation in the extracellular matrix. Amyloid is associated with human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The study of curli may help to understand human diseases thought to arise from improper amyloid fiber formation.  Gene regulation  CsgD is a positive transcriptional regulator of the csgBA operon. The CsgD protein is the transcription regulator and positively regulates the csgBA operon but shockingly does not regulate its own expression. The csgBA operon encodes the major structural subunit of curli, CsgA, as well as the nucleator protein CsgB. Further research still needs to be conducted in order to see what stimulates CsgD expression or activity but some evidence supports that the activation of the protein is caused by the phosphorylation of an aspartic acid residue of the N-terminal receiver domain. Since CsgD must be present for csgBA promoter activity, it is therefore shown that regulators of CsgD expression also influence the expression of csgBA. Many environmental cues play a role in Curli gene expression. Growth at a temperature below 30 degrees celsius promotes Curli gene expression. Additionally, when there is a lack of salt and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphate and iron, Curli gene expression is stimulated.

Overview Feminist HCI sets a stage for the explicit inclusion of feminism in HCI. Starting with Shaowen Bardzell's 2010 article \\"Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design\\", feminist HCI looks to the design and evaluation of interactive computing systems from a feminist lens. Building off of the epistemology of feminist standpoint theory, feminist HCI is focused on highlighting the values feminism in HCI work, like equity, diversity, and social justice, as well as on understanding the relationship gender has to the design and evaluation of interactive systems. Given that feminism is a heterogeneous concept, there is no singular methodology for undertaking feminist HCI projects. Bridging the gap between feminism and HCI, Feminist HCI has applications in theory, methodology, user research, and evaluation that will allow practitioners to critique systems already in place as well as generate new HCI practices focused on gender, equity, and social justice. Theoretical contributions of feminism like the masculinity of technology and the social production of gender point towards the importance of addressing gender and equity directly in HCI. Qualities of feminist interaction Building off of interaction design, feminist HCI builds on six core qualities to feminist interaction: * Pluralism: Building on feminist standpoint theory, this quality argues that human experience is too varied to be captured within the concept of universalism, thus pluralism, or heterogeneity, in design is of critical importance to HCI work. * Participation: Engaging users as active contributors to the design process (e.g., participatory design) is important for understanding and respecting the full range of contributions users can make. Feminist HCI argues that this work should occur alongside traditional usability testing. * Advocacy: Articulating concerns with the values that get built into a design by championing for well-motivated of ideas for creating just design choices. For instance, a needs analysis may reinforce discriminatory design behavior like design choices criticized by Gender HCI. Participatory approaches, like participatory design, support advocacy. * Ecology: Maintaining a focus on the larger social structures (ecosystems) that a design impacts throughout the process of development. For example, the way a house is designed has an impact on structuring the lives of people who live in it (see feminism and modern architecture for additional information). Likewise, HCI artifacts exist within a larger ecosystem that impacts both the design process and the user. * Embodiment: Contrasting from earlier HCI notions of a disembodied user (such as mental models), concentrating on the material attributes of human-computer interactions is essential for understanding the way differences and commonalities impact interaction. * Self-disclosure: Bringing to light the foundational assumptions inherent in everyday design allows us to understand how well the design model of a user matches the actual users. Select findings The following presents a sampling of results from research utilizing feminist HCI: *Six qualities of feminist interaction in an activist online community.  Jill Dimond et al.'s studies of Hollaback! outlines how activist CSCW systems embody feminist HCI in concrete ways. In particular, these studies examine feminist HCI through activist online communities describing how the six qualities of feminist interaction design play out in the work and experiences of site designers and site users. *Designing postpartum technologies by and for mothers using feminist HCI.  Catherine D'Ignazio et al.'s work highlights participation, advocacy, and ecology to improve breast pump technologies. By getting input from more than 1000 mothers, researchers put forth a number of improvements that could be made to the breast pump while discussing the wider impacts this type of research can make on improving postpartum technologies broadly. *Exploring implementation feminist HCI qualities in design when the users of a site design it themselves.  Casey Fiesler et al.'s work details how an online fan fiction community, consisting mostly of women, designed their own site. This site, Archive of Our Own, embedded the values most important to the community, such as accessibility, an embodiment of the feminist design quality pluralism.

Early life and career Fernando Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja was born in Jer√©z de la Frontera on 30 July 1879. He entered the Cavalry School in Valladolid in 1898, excelling at both riding and fencing. He completed his training in the French Cavalry School in Saumur. In 1909 he married Mar√≠a Cobo de Guzm√°n. Moroccan War After various postings on the Spanish Mainland and being promoted to Captain, he was ordered to Melilla, commanding the 2nd Taxdirt hunters squadron. He received a commendation for the Cross of Military Merit for his actions in battle. In the same year, after taking the village of Ulad Garen, he was promoted to Commander and awarded the Cross of Mar√≠a Cristina. Like his brother Miguel, Fernando criticised the Spanish intervention in Morocco. =Disaster of Annual= Charge of the River Igan, painting by Augusto Ferrer- Dalmau In 1920, by then lieutenant colonel, he was sent to the Cavalry Hunter Regiment of Alc√°ntara n¬∫ 14 as second commander. It was then that the so- called Disaster of Annual occurred. On 22 July 1921, Primo de Rivera had deployed the regiment‚Äôs four sabre squadrons and its machine gun squadron (461 men: 22 officers and 439 troops) behind Izumar. The Regiment‚Äôs commander, colonel Francisco Manella Corrales, had moved to Annual three days earlier to relieve colonel Arg√ºelles. The following day, Primo de Rivera, following orders received and leading his 2nd squadron, two sections of the 4th and one of the 1st regiment of Alc√°ntara, with a total of 192 riders, provided cover to the Spanish forces‚Äô retreat from Chaif towards Dar Drius and subsequently towards Batel. During the retreat, his regiment repeatedly charges against the Riffian fighters, sustaining heavy losses. The charges during the crossing of the river Ighane resulted in the loss of most of the horses, the soldiers having to continue charging on foot. In the end, the Cavalry Hunter Regiment of Alc√°ntara lost 28 of its 32 officers and 523 of its 685 troops in the battle. Death Primo de Rivera was killed during the siege of Monte-Arruit on 6 August having been wounded by an enemy grenade shell while observing the cannon fire from the parapet. His arm had to be amputated without anaesthesia due to the scarcity of resources available at their position and he succumbed shortly after to gangrene. For his actions in battle, Primo de Rivera was commended for the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand, awarded posthumously in 1923.

Three Kingdoms of Korea  The Gwanggaeto Stele was erected in 414. It is the largest memorial stele in the world. This photograph of a Joseon man standing next to the Gwanggaeto Stele was published in 1903 in Japan in The Landmarks and Ruins of Joseon. The 5th century was a period of great interaction on the Korean Peninsula that marked the first step toward the unification of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. The earliest known tianxia view of the world in Korean history is recorded in Goguryeo epigraphs dating to this period. Dongmyeong of Goguryeo was a god-king, the Son of Heaven, and his kingdom was the center of the world. As the descendants of the Son of Heaven, the kings of Goguryeo were the Scions of Heaven (), who had supreme authority and sacerdotally intermediated between Heaven and Earth. The Goguryeo concept of tianxia was significantly influenced by the original Chinese concept, but its foundation laid in Dongmyeong. In contrast to the Chinese tianxia, which was based on the Mandate of Heaven, the Goguryeo tianxia was based on divine ancestry. As Goguryeo became centralized, Dongmyeong became the state god of Goguryeo. His worship was widespread among the people, and the view that Goguryeo was the center of the world was not limited to the royal family and aristocracy. Dongmyeong was worshiped well into the Goryeo period of Korea; Yi Gyubo said \\"Even unlettered country folk can tell the tale of King [Dongmyeong].\\" Goguryeo was an authority unto itself. It had an independent sphere of influence in Northeast Asia for more than 200 years around the 5th and 6th centuries. Goguryeo viewed itself as the Land of the Scion of Heaven and viewed its neighboring states of Baekje, Silla, and Eastern Buyeo as tributary states. Together, they constituted a Goguryeo tianxia. A strong sense of commonality emerged, later culminating in a \\"Samhan\\" consciousness among the peoples of the Three Kingdoms. The Three Kingdoms of Korea were collectively called the Samhan in the Sui and Tang dynasties. Earlier, Goguryeo was called Samhan in the Book of Wei. The unification of the Samhan was later proclaimed by Silla in the 7th century and Goryeo in the 10th century. Goguryeo monarchs were called kings, not emperors. Goguryeo kings were sometimes elevated to \\"great kings\\", \\"holy kings\\", or \\"greatest kings\\". They were equivalent to emperors and khagans. The Goguryeo title of \\"greatest king\\", or taewang (), was similar to the Chinese title of \\"heavenly king\\". \\"King\\" was first used in Goguryeo around the beginning of the Common Era; it was first used in Northeast Asia in the 4th century BCE in Old Joseon, before \\"emperor\\", or huangdi, was first used in China. The indigenous titles of ga, gan, and han, which were similar to khan, were downgraded and the sinified title of king, or wang, became the supreme title in Northeast Asia. Goguryeo monarchs being called kings was not in deference to China; wang was not inferior to huangdi or khan in Goguryeo tradition. This bronze bowl was excavated from a Silla tomb in Gyeongju, the ancient capital of Silla. It is inscribed with the posthumous name of Gwanggaeto the Great. Goguryeo had a pluralistic concept of tianxia. The Goguryeo tianxia was one among others that constituted the world. During the 5th and 6th centuries, a balance of power was maintained in East Asia between the Northern and Southern dynasties, the Rouran Khaganate, Goguryeo, and, later, Tuyuhun. Goguryeo maintained tributary relations with the Northern and Southern dynasties; the relationships were voluntary and profitable. A policy of coexistence was pursued and relations were peaceful. Goguryeo's tributary relations with the Northern and Southern dynasties were nominal. The Northern and Southern dynasties had no control over Goguryeo's foreign policy; Goguryeo pursued policies that went against Chinese interests. Goguryeo restrained Northern Wei, the strongest power in East Asia at the time, by allying with its enemies. Northern Wei said that Goguryeo was \\"worthy\\" and gave preferential treatment to its envoys. Southern Qi said that Goguryeo was \\"so strong that it [would not] follow orders\\". Goguryeo maintained cordial relations with the Rouran, and together attacked the Didouyu. The Goguryeo tianxia was distinct from those of China and Inner Asia. China and Goguryeo recognized each other's spheres of influence. China did not directly intervene in Goguryeo's tianxia of Northeast Asia, and vice versa. Goguryeo did not have westward ambitions, and instead moved its capital to Pyongyang in the 5th century. Within its sphere of influence, Goguryeo partially subjugated the Khitan, Mohe, and Didouyu, and influenced Buyeo, Silla, and Baekje. Peace was maintained with China for more than 150 years; it ended with the unification of China by the Sui dynasty. The unification of China changed the international balance of power. With its supremacy in Northeast Asia threatened, Goguryeo warred with a unified China for 70 years until its defeat in 668 by the Tang dynasty and Silla. Silla's systems were based on those of Goguryeo. \\"Great king\\" was first used in Silla in the early 6th century as Silla expanded. Previously, maripgan, or \\"highest khan\\", was used; during its maripgan period (356‚Äì514), Silla was unified but not centralized. While the Goguryeo royalty and aristocracy were associated with the Son of Heaven, the Silla royalty and aristocracy were associated with the Buddha. Silla monarchs were viewed as the Buddha and Silla was viewed as a Buddha land from the early 6th century to the mid-7th century. Silla used its own era names during this period. \\"Great king\\" was last used in Silla by Muyeol of Silla; afterward, Silla accommodated itself to the tianxia of the Tang dynasty.  Goryeo  Taejo of Goryeo founded Goryeo in 918 as a successor to Goguryeo. He adopted the era name of \\"Bestowed by Heaven\\". Taejo was acknowledged as the successor to Dongmyeong in China. Goryeo was acknowledged as the successor to Goguryeo in China and Japan. Taejo unified Korea and proclaimed the unification of the \\"Samhan\\", or the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Goryeo viewed its Three Kingdoms heritage as nearly on a par with the imperial heritage of China. The conceptual world of the Samhan or the \\"Three Han\\"‚ÄîGoguryeo, Silla, and Baekje‚Äîconstituted a Goryeo tianxia. Within the Goryeo tianxia, called Haedong or \\"East of the Sea\\", Goryeo monarchs were emperors and Sons of Heaven. Goryeo monarchs were called emperors and Sons of Heaven. Imperial titles were used since the beginning of the dynasty; Taejo was called \\"Son of Heaven\\" by the last king of Silla. Goryeo monarchs addressed imperial edicts and were addressed as \\"Your Imperial Majesty\\" (). They were posthumously bestowed with imperial temple names. The use of imperial language was widespread and ubiquitous in Goryeo. Imperial titles and practices extended to members of the royal family. Members of the royal family were commonly invested as kings. Goryeo monarchs wore imperial yellow clothing. Goryeo's imperial system was modeled after that of the Tang dynasty. The government consisted of three departments and six ministries and the military consisted of five armies. Kaesong was an imperial capital and the main palace was an imperial palace; Pyongyang and Seoul were secondary capitals. Goryeo maintained a tributary system. The Jurchens who later founded the Jin dynasty viewed Goryeo as a parent country and Goryeo monarchs as suzerains. Goryeo monarchs were initially called \\"Emperor of Goryeo\\" by the Jin dynasty. The Song dynasty, the Liao dynasty, and the Jin dynasty were well aware of and tolerated Goryeo's imperial claims and practices. Goryeo had a pluralistic concept of tianxia. The Goryeo tianxia was one among others that constituted the world. During the 11th and part of the 12th centuries, a balance of power was maintained in East Asia between Goryeo, the Liao dynasty, the Song dynasty, and Western Xia. Goryeo played an active role in East Asian politics. Goryeo monarchs were called kings vis-√†-vis China; Goryeo successively maintained tributary relations with the Five Dynasties (beginning with the Later Tang dynasty), the Song dynasty, the Liao dynasty, and the Jin dynasty. However, Goryeo's tributary relations with them were nominal. Goryeo had no political, economic, or military obligations to China. According to Peter Yun: \\"While Goryeo may have admired and adopted many of China's culture and institutions, there is little evidence that it accepted the notion of Chinese political superiority as the natural order of things.\\" Goryeo monarchs possessed full de jure sovereignty. During the 11th and 12th centuries, Goryeo was assertive toward China. Goryeo treated imperial envoys from the Song, Liao, and Jin dynasties as equals, not superiors; imperial envoys were consistently downgraded. Goryeo used both a royal and an imperial system during its early and middle periods. Goryeo monarchs were not strictly emperors at home and kings abroad: Goryeo's royal system was also used at home, and its imperial system was also used abroad. They were used almost indiscriminately. Goryeo's identity was not defined by its monarchs being kings or emperors but, instead, by them being Sons of Heaven. According to Remco E. Breuker: \\"The [Goryeo] ruler has been king, he has been emperor, and at times he was both. His correct appellation is not important, however, compared to the fact that he was considered to rule his own domain [tianxia]; his own, not just politically and practically, but also ideologically and ontologically.\\" Goryeo was an independent tianxia; within it, Goryeo monarchs were Sons of Heaven, called \\"Haedongcheonja\\" (), who were viewed as superhuman beings who alone mediated between Heaven and the Korean people. The Goryeo worldview was possibly a continuation of the Goguryeo worldview. The Goryeo worldview was possibly influenced by Dongmyeong worship and Balhae refugees. The rulers of Balhae used imperial titles, such as Seongwang () and Hwangsang (), and had independent era names. In 1270, Goryeo capitulated to the Mongols and became a semi-autonomous \\"son-in-law state\\" (Î∂ÄÎßàÍµ≠; ÈßôÈ¶¨Âúã) of the Yuan dynasty, bringing an end to its imperial system.

The event took place on August 28, 1994 at the Osaka-j≈ç Hall in Osaka, Japan. Eleven matches were contested at the event. The main event featured Atsushi Onita taking on his longtime rival Masashi Aoyagi in a no ropes electrified explosive barbed wire barricade double hell match. Onita won the match by knocking out Aoyagi. Another important match on the event was a street fight deathmatch between Mr. Pogo and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga, which Pogo won. The event also marked Eiji Ezaki's return to FMW after having worked in Mexico and his first match in FMW as Hayabusa, in which he took on Sabu in a winning effort. Background Atsushi Onita headlined the event against longtime rival Masashi Aoyagi. At the 5th Anniversary Show, Genichiro Tenryu defeated Atsushi Onita in a match which stipulated that if Onita would lose then he would be forced to retire from wrestling. However, after the match, Onita revealed that the retirement stipulation would be for the next year's Anniversary Show and began a retirement tour that would take place throughout the year. Onita's former rival Masashi Aoyagi returned to FMW in the summer of 1994 and attacked Onita, leading to the two rivals facing each other for the first time in five years after having exchanged wins with each other in FMW's first two shows Grudge in Nagoya and Grudge in Tokyo in 1989. The two rivals first squared off in the WAR 6-Man Tag Team Tournament at WAR 2nd Anniversary Show, where Onita, Genichiro Tenryu and Crusher Bam Bam Bigelow defeated the team of Aoyagi, Kendo Nagasaki and Arashi in the semi-final round. Onita's match with Aoyagi at Summer Spectacular would be a no ropes electrified explosive barbed wire barricade double hell match. On August 22, the two rivals competed against each other for the last time before Summer Spectacular as the team of Onita and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga defeated the team of Aoyagi and Mr. Pogo in a street fight. Sabu was the first opponent of Hayabusa in FMW. Mitsuhiro Matsunaga unsuccessfully challenged Atsushi Onita for the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship at Year End Spectacular and after the loss, he joined Onita in his feud with Mr. Pogo and his entourage. Pogo defeated Onita for the title on January 6 and also won the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship with Hisakatsu Oya on April 21. At 5th Anniversary Show, Matsunaga and Tarzan Goto unsuccessfully challenged Pogo and Oya for the tag team titles. Pogo and Matsunaga continued to feud with each other to renew their W*ING rivalry, leading to a match between the two at Summer Spectacular. On July 31, Onita and Matsunaga defeated Pogo and Oya in a no ropes barbed wire double hell deathmatch to win the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. Eiji Ezaki debuted in FMW in 1991 and Atsushi Onita realized potential in the rookie to become a big star in FMW and sent him on a learning excursion to Mexico in 1993. Ezaki developed a masked character for his excursion called Hayabusa. He made his first appearance in Japan as Hayabusa in the 1994 Super J-Cup against Jushin Liger in a highly acclaimed match. A match was made between Hayabusa and Sabu at Summer Spectacular to test how the character worked in FMW and if it clicked with the fans, marking Ezaki's first match as Hayabusa in FMW. At 5th Anniversary Show, Team Canada members Ricky Fuji, Big Titan and The Gladiator took on Fuyuki-Gun from WAR in an interpromotional match. During the match, a miscommunication took place between Titan and Gladiator which led to both men shoving each other. Fuji tried to separate them but Gladiator won the match and then walked out on Team Canada, effectively ending the team. As a result, Titan and Gladiator began feuding with each other. Gladiator formed a team with Goro Tsurumi, Hideki Hosaka and Hisakatsu Oya. Titan and Fuji defeated Gladiator and Tsurumi on July 23. Titan and Gladiator had their first singles match against each other on July 31, which Gladiator won, setting up a rematch between the two at Summer Spectacular. Event =Preliminary matches= Katsutoshi Niiyama, Koji Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Battle Ranger Z, Masato Tanaka and Gosaku Goshogawara in the opening match after Nakagawa performed a diving shoulder block to Tanaka. The team of Miwa Sato, Megumi Kudo and Nurse Nakamura took on Mad Dog Military's Crusher Maedomari, Shark Tsuchiya and Tsuppari Mack in a Texas Deathmatch. Near the end of the match, Mack threw Kudo in the guardrail far from the ring, allowing Mad Dog Military to gain advantage as Tsuchiya performed a Tsuchi Bomb on Nakamura to get the win. Eiji Ezaki made his first appearance as \\"Hayabusa\\" in FMW by defeating Sabu at the event. Ricky Fuji performed a dragon suplex on Mach Hayato to get the victory. The team of Dr. Luther and Dr. Hannibal defeated The Great Sasuke and Damien after Luther performed a diving leg drop to Damien. Sambo Asako took on Mr. Gannosuke in a match, where Gannosuke picked up a major victory with a German suplex. Combat Toyoda defended her FMW Independent and WWA World Women's Championship against Yukie Nabeno. Nabeno performed a Moonsault to win the title. Eiji Ezaki made his first appearance in FMW as Hayabusa against Sabu. Sabu's back was injured when he placed Hayabusa on a table and attempted to drive him through the table with a 450¬∞ splash but Hayabusa moved out of the way. Hayabusa took advantage and performed a shooting star press to win the match. Both men shook hands with each other after the match. Big Titan took on his former tag team partner The Gladiator. Gladiator performed an Awesome Bomb on Titan to win the match. Mitsuhiro Matsunaga competed against Mr. Pogo in a Street Fight Deathmatch. After a back and forth match, Pogo hit Matsunaga with a flaming barbed wire baseball bat to win the match. Tarzan Goto defeated Hisakatsu Oya with a guillotine chair shot. =Main event match= Atsushi Onita competed against his longtime rival Masashi Aoyagi in a no ropes electrified explosive barbed wire barricade double hell match. Aoyagi punished Onita with his stiff kicks and tossed him into the exploding double hell barbedwire. Despite sustaining the damage, Onita managed to make a comeback and performed two Thunder Fire Powerbombs and Aoyagi was knocked out, with Onita getting the victory. Aftermath Yukihiro Kanemura's FMW debut shortly after the event would lead to the formation of W*ING Alliance. Atsushi Onita was badly injured in his match with Masashi Aoyagi and required 111 switches in his body and got 1,032 stitches in his overall body. On September 7, Onita defeated Mr. Pogo in a no ropes exploding barbed wire double hell deathmatch to win the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship. After the match, former W*ING wrestler Yukihiro Kanemura debuted in FMW and attacked Onita. Kanemura quickly joined Pogo and Mitsuhiro Matsunaga to form W*ING Alliance. Matsunaga was initially reluctant but Onita accused him of being allied with W*ING and an angered Matsunaga left FMW team, forcing Onita and Matsunaga to vacate the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. A rivalry began between Onita and W*ING, which would ultimately culminate at Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular on September 28, 1997, with Onita defeating W*ING Kanemura in a match, forcing W*ING to disband. Hayabusa returned to Mexico after Summer Spectacular and finally made his full-time return to FMW at 6th Anniversary Show as Atsushi Onita's opponent in his retirement match. Onita defeated Hayabusa to retain the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and then immediately vacated the title to retire and pursue an acting career and Hayabusa succeeded Onita as the promotion's ace for the rest of FMW's existence. Big Titan and The Gladiator continued their feud after Summer Spectacular, as Titan finally got a win over Gladiator in another rematch on September 7. Gladiator would join Mr. Pogo's W*ING Alliance and defeated Titan on December 9 to end the feud as Titan left FMW after the match. After winning the Independent Women's Championship, Yukie Nabeno continued to feud with Mad Dog Military alongside Megumi Kudo. On September 7, the team of Combat Toyoda, Shark Tsuchiya and Crusher Maedomari took on Nabeno, Kudo and Miwa Sato in a match in which Tsuchiya stole the win from Toyoda, which brought Toyoda and Tsuchiya to blows and both women brawled with each other and Toyoda broke away from Mad Dog Military, turning face and siding with FMW to feud with Mad Dog Military. On December 9, the Mad Dog Military team of Shark Tsuchiya, Crusher Maedomari and Tsuppari Mack defeated Combat Toyoda, Megumi Kudo and Yukie Nabeno when Nabeno suffered a severe injury, which forced her to vacate her titles in a press conference on December 12. Nabeno would return to FMW in late 1995 but the severity of her injury forced her to retire on August 1, 1996.

Biography Takeuchi was born in 1946 and gained a B.A. from International Christian University in Tokyo, and an M.B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley. His early non-academic career included work at McCann-Erickson in Tokyo and San Francisco and at McKinsey & Company in Tokyo. From 1976 to 1983 Takeuchi had his first faculty position at Harvard Business School, as an assistant professor in the Marketing Unit. He moved to Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo in 1983, becoming a professor in 1987. In another spell at Harvard Business School from 1995 to 1996, Takeuchi served as a visiting professor in the Advanced Management Program. In 1998 Takeuchi became the founding dean of Hitotsubashi University's business school, the Graduate School of International Corporate Strategy. 2010 saw Takeuchi appointed to the position of Professor Emeritus at that university and in the same year he was additionally appointed as a professor at Harvard Business School. Takeuchi has written or co-authored numerous articles for the Harvard Business Review. He has served on the planning board of the World Economic Forum and is an external director at Mitsui & Co. and an outside director at Daiwa Securities Group Inc.  The New New Product Development Game  Takeuchi collaborated on a number of articles with Ikujiro Nonaka (Èáé‰∏≠ ÈÉÅÊ¨°ÈÉé), a colleague at Hitotsubashi University, including the 1986 Harvard Business Review article The New New Product Development Game, in which they emphasised speed and flexibility for new product development. The article looked at practices in a number of successful manufacturing companies such as Fuji-Xerox, Honda, 3M and Toyota. The authors drew attention to the practise in those companies of having an overlapping development process ('like Sashimi'), rather than the older sequential approach. They likened it to the game of Rugby, where a team 'tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth' and where a team may employ different tactics to make the best use of its talents. The authors found that teams in the most successful companies they examined exhibited the following conditions: * Autonomy - being self-organising and empowered to make decisions over how to do the work * Cross-fertilization - having within the teams all the skills needed to complete the task * Self-Transcendence - elevating their goals and pushing beyond the normally accepted limit; challenging the status quo The article attracted attention when it was published but its significance for software development was born seven years later when a team at Easel Corporation led by Jeff Sutherland alighted on the article and spotted the opportunity it offered to achieve their goal of delivering software on schedule and under budget. Sutherland went on to develop the concept in conjunction with Ken Schwaber as the Scrum framework, an agile software development technique now used across the globe.  The Nonaka-Takeuchi model of knowledge creation and practice  Takeuchi's colleague Ikujiro Nonaka wrote an article The Knowledge-Creating Company in the Harvard Business Review, 1991. It explored two types of knowledge, namely tacit knowledge which is that learned by experience and communicated indirectly, and explicit knowledge, which is that recorded in documentation, manuals and procedures. Nonaka wrote that Japanese companies viewed knowledge as primarily tacit but had mastered converting tacit to explicit and back again (the 'spiral of knowledge'). In 1995 Nonaka and Takeuchi co-authored a book which expanded on the subject and brought it to a wider audience: The Knowledge-Creating Company : How Japanese Companies Create the Dynamics of Innovation. The authors described the methods used in successful Japanese companies to create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products. They called this 'organizational knowledge creation' ‚Äì an ability to 'create new knowledge, disseminate it throughout the organization and embody it in products, services and systems'. The book published by Oxford University Press was named as Best Book of the Year in Business and Management, 1996 by the Association of American Publishers.

It can be distinguished from related species by its exceptionally broad and knobbly main chela (claw). Description The knot- fingered mud crab is a small crab with unequal-sized chelae. The larger one is particularly broad and has teeth in the \\"molar area\\" and an immobile finger. Often this claw is worn and coalesced. The carapace and upper side of the limbs are a dull mottled reddish colour while the undersides of the body and limbs are whitish. Individuals living in caves are paler in colour and have antennules with white spots. Distribution and habitat The knot-fingered mud crab is native to the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean, its range including southern Florida, Bermuda, the Caribbean Sea, the West Indies, and along the coast of South America as far south as Cabo Frio in Brazil. It was introduced into Hawaii in the 1950s and has also been present on the Pacific Coast of California since the 1980s or earlier. Ecology This crab is sometimes parasitised by Loxothylacus panopaei, a species of parasitic barnacle that develops inside a host crab, manipulating the behaviour of the crab so that it cares for the barnacle's eggs, carrying them around and brooding them under its abdomen as if they were its own young. In fact, both male and female crabs are prevented from breeding and effectively castrated by the parasitic barnacle. Other mud crabs also act as hosts to the barnacle, but it was as a parasite of the knot-fingered mud crab that it was first described in 1884, the type locality being Tampa, Florida.

In 2019, she was included in Time magazine's \\"Next 100.\\"  Early life and education  Emily Weiss was raised in Wilton, Connecticut. Her father worked as an executive at Pitney Bowes and her mother stayed at home. In high school, Weiss interned at Ralph Lauren for two summers and briefly had a modeling career. While interning at Teen Vogue in college, she appeared on The Hills on a three-episode arc with Lauren Conrad and Whitney Port. Weiss graduated from New York University in 2007 with a degree in studio art. She was a fashion assistant at W Magazine and an on-set styling assistant for Vogue where she assisted Elissa Santisi.  Into the Gloss  Weiss launched Into the Gloss, a blog featuring predominantly interviews with women, in September 2010. She stayed at her day job at Vogue and worked on Into the Gloss in the mornings between the hours of 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. A popular series on the blog is Top Shelf, where subjects are interviewed in their bathrooms and photos of their shelves and medicine cabinets are featured. Previous interviews include Jenna Lyons and Karlie Kloss. By early 2012, the site had more than 200,000 unique visitors per month. By May 2016, the site garnered 1.3 million visitors. After Weiss reached 10 million page views per month and acquired corporate partnerships for the site and a small staff, she quit her job at Vogue to focus on her business ventures full-time.  Glossier  In 2014, Weiss started approaching venture capitalists with ideas for expansion, including a potential Into the Gloss-curated e-commerce platform. Weiss eventually raised $2 million in seed funding, with the help of venture capitalist Kirsten Green, the founder of San Francisco-based Forerunner Ventures. Weiss used this initial investment to hire a small team and launch Glossier.com. In October 2014, Weiss introduced Glossier's first four products on her Into the Gloss blog and announced the launch of Glossier.com. The Glossier team launched the e-commerce site with an all-purpose balm, a facial mist, a sheer skin tint, and a moisturizer. Six weeks after the first product launch, Glossier announced $8.4 million in Series A funding led by Thrive Capital. Glossier has since gone through three rounds of funding and raised $186,400,000. According to Polina Marinova of Fortune, Weiss, \\"Quietly turned Glossier into one of the most disruptive brands in beauty.\\" She initially pitched the company to 12 firms, with 11 not interested. In February 2018, Weiss released that Glossier had successfully raised an additional $52 million in a Series C round of funding. In March 2019, Weiss announced that Glossier had officially raised $100 million in a Series D round of funding and was valued at $1.2 billion. The round was led by Sequoia Capital and Glossier announced at this time that it more than doubled its revenue in 2018, adding over 1 million new customers. Since its initial launch with four products, Glossier has expanded its product line to include skin serums, masks, shower gel, body lotion, fragrance, lip balms and several other beauty and skincare related items. Glossier dropped GlossiWEAR on July 17, 2019. They released limited edition products in addition to their original grey Glossier crewneck sweatshirt. They are set to release more GlossiWEAR products in the near future, according to glossier.com. In early 2019, Glossier added Glossier Play to its product umbrella. The line includes pigmented and metallic makeup products, such as eye shadows and eyeliners. In 2020, the company announced plans to suspend the line's production. Weiss stated that launching a sub-brand was, in hindsight, unnecessary, ‚ÄúThe realisation we had was, ‚ÄòHuh, we could have just launched more make-up products‚Äô.‚Äù  Personal Life  Weiss married Will Gaybrick a senior executive at Stripe.

The name is derived from an academic who first speculated on the possibility that a lake existed in lower Antelope Valley. It occupied the area of the lower Antelope Valley and of the lakes Rogers Lake and Rosamond Lake during the Pleistocene. It dried up during the Holocene.  Context  During the Pleistocene, a number of lakes formed in the deserts of North America, these include Lake Bonneville in Utah, Lake Lahontan in Nevada, a cascade of lakes after Owens Lake, Lake Mojave and Lake Manly in California. Their formation was directed by cold periods of the last glacial maximum and other climate oscillations such as the Younger Dryas that reduced evaporation in the deserts, as well as storm tracks that were displaced south by the continental ice sheets.  The lake  Lake Thompson was kidney shaped and covered a surface of (at first it was believed to have covered a surface of ). It developed in the westernmost Mojave Desert, covering much of the Antelope Valley to elevations of , with additional shorelines suggested at elevations of . Two islands existed in the water body, cliffs have been cut at some sites along its former shore and there are dunes as well. Stickleback fish may have entered the lake through Peninsular Ranges drainages and a number of different animals from snails over fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds to mammoths have been found in lake sediments. Present-day Boron, California, Kramer, California, Lancaster, California and Rosamond, California lie in the bed of the former lake; urbanization along with the growth of alluvial fans has buried the shores of the former lake at many sites.  Hydrology  The catchment of Lake Thompson covers a surface area of and is bordered by the San Gabriel Mountains to the south and the Tehachapi Mountains in the west. Several creeks (such as Little Rock Creek) descending from the mountains nourished the lake, the lake had a number of tributaries. When waters reached an elevation of , the maximum depth of the lake would have been about based on borehole data. It is possible that Lake Thompson overflowed northwards, into the Fremont Valley;. presently the sill that water would have to flow over is too high for spilling of a lake to occur, but later sedimentation may have raised the sill. An overflow eastward close to Boron, California towards the Mojave River and/or Lake Harper is also possible but less likely.  History  A number of lakes developed in the basin of Lake Thompson during the Cenozoic. Deep lakes existed around 36,000 and later as well as 16,200 - 12,600 years before present, with shallower lakebodies around 26,000 - 21,000 years before present, and desiccation between 21,000 - 16,200 years before present as well as during the Holocene. A further lake level increase may have occurred 7,700 years before present. The lake does not exist anymore, owing to a drier present-day climate, although parts of its former bed can flood during wet winters. Rogers Lake, Rosamond Lake and Buckskin Lake are located on the bed of former Lake Thompson. The rest of the lakebed is covered with lacustrine sediments, although fluvial and aeolian sediments also cover parts of the lakefloor.

Date: 13 August 1921 During the Russian Civil War, several former Tsarist officers joined the Red Army, either voluntarily or through coercion. This list includes officers of the Imperial Army commissioned before 1917 who joined the Bolsheviks as commanders or military specialists. For former Tsarist NCOs promoted under the Bolsheviks, see Mustang.  Overview  P. P. Lebedev, N. N. Petin, S. M. Budyonny, B. M. Shaposhnikov. Seated: S. S. Kamenev, S. I. Gusev, A. I. Yegorov and K. E. Voroshilov in 1921. Following the Russian Revolution in 1917, the ruling communist Bolsheviks, in the fashion of most traditional Marxists, hoped to disband the standing Imperial Russian Army of the deposed Tsardom and replace it with a militia system. The outbreak of civil war led them to opt for a regular military in 1918 and they created the Red Army to oppose the anti-revolutionary White movement. The pre-existing army had a 250,000-strong officer corps. Of these, 75,000 were inducted into the Red Army, most of them being drafted and many not supportive of the Bolsheviks' political agenda. However, a large number joined out of a desire to maintain Russian territorial integrity (they believed that only the Bolsheviks could govern effectively) and to curb foreign influence in the country (the White leadership had promised foreign governments special privileges under their rule in exchange for support). As such, the overwhelming majority of the officers in the Red Army had formerly served in the Imperial military, much to the chagrin of Bolshevik leaders who were anxious to assert their authority over the armed forces. They were forced to rely on the ex-Tsarist officers, dubbed \\"military specialists\\", due to a deficit of trained commanders among the revolutionaries. Throughout the war the Red Army's command staff, the Stavka, was dominated by Tsarist officers. In spite of his colleagues' wariness, Vladimir Lenin praised them for their contributions to the Bolshevik war effort: > \\"You have heard about the series of the brilliant victories won by the Red > Army. There are tens of thousands of old colonels and other officers in its > ranks. If we had not taken them into service and them work for us, we could > not have created the Army...only with their help was the Red Army able to > win the victories that it did.\\" Immediately following the conflict the former Tsarists made up the majority of the General Staff Academy's faculty and constituted over 90 percent of all instructional and administrative staff at military schools. The Stavka was organised in a manner very similar to its Tsarist antecedent and much of the military curriculum was copied from the Imperial General Staff Academy. The Bolsheviks reformed the Red Army in the mid-1920s. In an attempt to reduce the reliance on the mistrusted ex-Tsarists they reduced the officer corps and educated new cadets. Leon Trotsky's removal from the Commissariat of Defence was in part driven by his perceived over-reliance on Tsarist officers. His replacement, Mikhail Frunze, further decreased their number in army. By 1930, ex-Tsarists made up only about 10 percent of the officer corps.

Solarized architectural glass is a type of architectural glass, used as a building material, that has changed color as a result of a chemical reaction between a glass decolorizer and ultra-violet light. Sometimes known as \\"desert glass\\", or \\"sun-purpled glass\\", solarized glass is most commonly observed as bottles and glassware. However, solarized glass does occasionally appear in architectural contexts and uses, especially window panes, doorknobs, and pavement lights. The physical characteristics and the relative rarity of this glass for windows has meant that it is understood as a distinct glass type. Chemical description Although silica glass is naturally colorless, chemical imperfections in naturally occurring silica sometimes results in discoloration during the production process. Historically, glass makers have compensated for this by adding a chemical decolorizer. Since ancient times, one of the most common chemical decolorizers has been manganese dioxide (MnO2), which in small quantities, is an effective additive to produce clear glass. However, in large quantities, glass treated with manganese dioxide photo-oxidizes when exposed to ultra-violet sunlight over a period of years to decades. The result is glass that changes from a clear to a lavender-purple color. In addition to manganese dioxide, other decolorizers have been historically used that undergo photo-oxidation. For example, selenium and cerium have both been used in the past as decolorizers. In large quantities, these chemicals have turned glass yellow and amber respectively when exposed to ultra-violet light. Historical uses Although most commonly observed as bottles and glassware, solarized glass does occasionally appear in architectural contexts and uses. Most notably, many early 19th century houses in the neighborhood of Beacon Hill, Boston, MA have windows with purple panes of glass. The color of these panes was the result of an excess of manganese dioxide added in the glass making process from about 1800 to 1830. Since this glass was originally intended to be clear, the purple color was actually a manufacturer's mistake. Some apocryphal stories credit this glass to a French maker that accidentally imported defective glass but ceased production after it was discovered the glass would turn purple. For this reason, 19th century solarized architectural glass is rare. Nevertheless, in Boston, the purple glass came to be seen as a desirable character mark for these houses and was associated with elegance and the upper classes. By the early 20th century, homeowners and builders were mimicking the original solarized glass by retrofitting older windows with solarized glass that never previously existed in those homes. Solarized architectural glass found in a historic window Physical characteristics Solarized architectural glass is not, in itself, a distinct glass making process. Solarized glass used in windows was historically made either by the crown glass method or is cylinder blown sheet glass. However, the striking color of this glass, coupled with its rarity and distinctive physical characteristics means that it is a distinct sub-type of architectural glass and a character-defining feature for many historic buildings. This glass exhibits several physical characteristics and properties. The shade of the purple color is dependent on the level of sunlight exposure. This means that panes of solarized glass will turn a darker purple if they receive heavy exposure to light, such as on the south facing fa√ßade of a building. Likewise, a recessed window will receive less light and therefore turn a lighter shade of purple. Further, the depth of the purple shade is also dependent on the level of manganese dioxide present in the glass. Those portions of this glass that do not receive light exposure ‚Äì such as along the edges where the glass meets the window muntin ‚Äì do not undergo the same photo-oxidation and remain clear. Finally, the glass is very brittle and highly delicate. It is uncertain if this is a result of the manganese oxide or other methods as part of the manufacturing process. In addition to solarized window glass, solarized glass is also found in other architectural contexts, such as glass doorknobs.

While attempting to land at Ivanovo airport, the Tupolev Tu-134 crashed into a group of buildings in the village of Lebyazhy Lug. Investigators determined the cause of the accident was errors made by the crew and the air traffic controller. There were no fatalities on the ground, but all 84 people on board the flight died in the crash.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-134A registered RA-65058 to Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 26,307 flight hours and 16,388 pressurization cycles.  Crew  The cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Captain Vladimir Nikolayevich Gruzdev (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞–µ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä—É–∑–¥–µ–≤) * Co-pilot Vasiliy Yuryevich Gruzdev (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏–π –Æ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ì—Ä—É–∑–¥–µ–≤) * Flight engineer Mikhail Gennadievich Karlov (–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ì–µ–Ω–Ω–∞–¥—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤) * Flight engineer instructor Yuri Mikhailovich Eremenko (–Æ—Ä–∏–π –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á –ï—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∫–æ) * Navigator Mikhail Anatolevich Konovalov (–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ö–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª–æ–≤) The two flight attendants in the cabin were S. Ermilova and T. Mokrova.  Synopsis  The second phase of the flight took off from Donetsk at 21:03 Moscow Time. On board the aircraft were the seven crew members and 77 passengers, of whom 21 were children. No issues in flight from Donetsk were reported. At 22:27 and at an altitude of 10,100 meters the flight began to descend 6,000 meters on a bearing of 60¬∞ in preparation for the approach, which was to be carried out by the pilot in command. The decrease in altitude occurred approximately 100 kilometers from the airport and approximately 40 kilometers from the point where the flight was due to turn for the approach. After the descent the flight remained at its current altitude for two minutes at a speed of 440 km/h. After the Tu-134 passed Dobrynskoe as designated by air traffic control, while at a distance of 75 kilometers from the airport, the crew contacted the air traffic controller who gave them permission descend to an altitude of 1,800 meters and set them on a bearing of 292¬∞ for landing. At 22:39:20 the flight reported to be 28 kilometers from the airport and at an altitude of 1,800 meters when they were actually at an altitude of 2,000 meters. As instructed the flight flew level for 25 seconds, decreasing airspeed from 580 km/h to 525 km/h. At 22:39:40 while 25 km from the airport the controller gave the flight permission to descend to 1,500 meters and transferred the flight to another controller in the tower. When communications with the new controller began the flight reported their altitude to be 1,500 meters and proceeded with level flight for 25 seconds. When the flight was 2.5 kilometers to the right of the cut-off point of the glideslope they requested permission to enter landing mode. The flight, having deviated 9 kilometers from the route, had reached the transition level at 22:40. Upon receiving permission to reduce their altitude to 500 meters and execute a fourth turn at 20¬∞, they flight executed the procedure through a transition level of 1,200 meters and a 17 kilometer radial distance. The flight was then 3 kilometers from the aerodrome and flying at a speed of 450 km/h when it had still not released the landing gear; in the preparations for landing the navigator forgot to set his altimeter to the correct pressure. During the third turn the aircraft reduced speed to 390 km/h at a consistent altitude. During the beginning of fourth turn the landing gear was released and the flaps adjusted only when the aircraft was 2,600 meters from the glideslope, while at an altitude of 1,200 meters and a speed of 410 km/h. The fourth turn started with a roll of 20¬∞ at a distance of 12.5 kilometers from the entrance to the runway; due to previous lateral deviations the roll would have had to reach 30¬∞ in order to proceed with the route. At 22:41 the air traffic controller informed the flight crew of weather conditions with visibility being 1,200 meters and mild fog. Having lost two minutes of needed time to execute the planned route, there was not enough time to sufficiently reduce speed to 330 km/h, adjust flaps to 20¬∞, and reach an altitude of 500 meters safely to continue with the landing. Nevertheless, the crew continued with the landing and the air traffic controller did not give the crew any warnings. The aircraft exited the fourth turn at a distance of 8,600 meters from the entrance to the runway with a speed of 390 km/h and an altitude 100 meters above the limit but with the stabilizer, flaps and slats in the correct positions. At a distance of 7,500 meters from the runway and an altitude of 320 meters the navigator picked up on the deviation and asked the captain about correcting the deviation to which the captain initially refused. While descending to the glidepath at an altitude of 270 meters the copilot corrected the left bank by adjusting the horizontal stabilizer in one procedure (changing the stabilizer required fulfilling three procedures); doing so caused the aircraft to become less stable. At a distance of 4,500 meters from the runway, the aircraft held a lateral deviation ranging from 200‚Äì300 meters and an altitude of 200 meters. To enter the glidepath, the captain began to turn to the right causing the aircraft to roll up to 35¬∞. The procedure was carried out uncoordinated fashion, causing the vertical speed to increase to up to 15‚Äì16 m/s. After passing the Non-directional beacon at an altitude of 170 meters (which should have been 210 meters) while 40 meters to the left of the correct position relative to the runway, the navigator again warned the captain but was ignored. At an altitude of approximately 100 meters the captain attempted to take the aircraft out of the bank but did not attempt to slow down the vertical speed. After the navigator's last attempt to convince the captain to abort the landing and make a go-around, the aircraft banked sharply to the right 10¬∞. The aircraft struck foliage to its right at a distance of 2,962 meters from the start of the runway while on a bearing of 295¬∞ and 60 meters to the left of the intended path. The aircraft crashed into the ground 512 meters after first striking the trees; several brick buildings and cars were damaged by debris but no one on the ground was killed. All 84 passengers and crew were killed in the crash.  Conclusions  Investigation showed that there were no mechanical issues with the aircraft itself and the aircraft was intact until it had crashed. The primary cause of the accident was the captain's decision to continue the route under unsuitable parameters for landing. Insufficient crew communication and poor cockpit resource management also led to periodic loss of control compounded by failure to follow guidelines for maximum rate of descent as outlined in the Tu-134's flight manual. The air traffic controller at Ivanovo airport acted in violation of aviation guidelines by not notifying the crew about their deviations from the course and glide path.

The southern segment, which extends from Lake Coeur d'Alene through Sandpoint to north of Colburn, contains compelling evidence of the east-dipping Purcell Trench normal fault. The middle segment, which extends from Colburn and Naples, is unfaulted. The northern segment from Naples to Kootenay Lake also contains evidence of a major eastdipping normal fault.

The valley floor higher than the present outlet from the west arm of Kootenay Lake near Nelson, British Columbia, which is about above sea level (asl); it could have been as much as asl. There were at least three glacial invasions and with theie associated receding ice fronts. As of 1953 it was not possible to differentiate the effects of the earlier Illinoian and earlier glacial periods below Bonners Ferry from those of the Wisconsin glaciation period.

Biography George Wickes was born in Bury St. Edmunds, England on 7 July 1698, the eighth of ten children born to James and Dorothy Burton Wickes. His father was an upholder or upholsterer by trade. In December 1712, Wickes was apprenticed for seven (7) years to Samuel Wastell, who worked in the Britannia standard of silver (958 parts per 1,000) set into place by Parliament on 25 March 1697. He registered his first marks in London in 1721‚Äì22 with an address of Threadneedle Street in the City of London. In 1730, Wickes entered into a partnership with John Craig and moved to Norris Street. It was during this period that he began royal commissions and was appointed Goldsmith to Frederick, Prince of Wales, the then heir apparent to the British throne. By 1735, he had become independent again and moved to King's Arms, Panton Street. This was the beginning of successful business that would later become known as Garrard & Co. Business records indicate that Wickes employed a number of individuals including Edward Wakelin. In 1750, Wickes took his former apprentice, Samuel Netherton(1723-1803) as his partner. In 1760, Wickes retired and his business was taken over by another apprentice, John Parker. Legacy The business that George Wickes had built up later became Garrard & Co. In 1952, Garrard & Co was acquired by the Goldsmiths‚Äô and Silversmiths‚Äô Company of Regents Street. The Garrard & Co location on Albemarle held an auction sale for the fittings, furniture and books. The Albemarle location was only the company‚Äôs second location since 1735, having moved from the original Panton Street location in 1911. It was during this auction viewing that Norman Penzer, an expert of Paul Storr, stumbled across the Garrard & Co ledgers going all the back to George Wickes and the founding of the firm in 1735. Penzer along with Arthur Grimwade, Reginald Eyles and John Hayward reacted quickly to save the volumes from being trashed. Although the acquiring firm eventually decided to keep the newer Victorian era ledgers with confidential royal accounts, the Wickes-Wakelin-Garrard ledgers were preserved for posterity. The volumes contained a wealth of information and contributed greatly to the study of 18th century English silver.

Sat≈ç played in Game 2 of the match on March 22, 2014, and his opponent was the program . Sat≈ç lost the game in 95 moves. Promotion history The promotion history for Sat≈ç is as follows. *1990: 6-ky≈´ *1993: 1-dan *1997, October 1: 4-dan *2003, January 24: 5-dan *2007, August 28: 6-dan *2015, December 17: 7-dan Awards and honors Sat≈ç received the Japan Shogi Association Annual Shogi Awards for \\"Best New Player\\" and \\"Best Winning Percentage\\" for the 200506 shogi year. Wig performances Sat≈ç has achieved quite a bit of notoriety for his \\"wig performances\\" during various shogi related and other TV appearances. He has stated in interviews that he began to notice he was starting to lose his hair around he was twenty-two years old. He tried some commercial hair restoration medications at first, but they were ineffective. He then tried getting perms to cover his hair loss but they only seemed to damage his remaining hair and make things worse. Eventually by the time he turned twenty-five, he had lost most of the hair at the top of his head. Sat≈ç has said he decided to purchase his first wig when he was twenty- nine years old. He did so because he the top of his head started to feel \\"lonely\\". He then started to use the wigs as a \\"tool\\" at live events to add some humor and make shogi fans laugh a little because felt simple straight- forward game commentary was not as interesting. Removing and re-adding his wig made his game commentary funnier and helped him stand out a bit. His performance during the commentary of S≈çta Fujii's record-setting 29th consecutive wina live AbemaTV webcast on June 26, 2017, watched by an estimated 7.4 million peopleis where the \\"wig legend\\" is said to have been born and the first time his performance was seen by so many people. Sat≈ç has said that he has a about fifteen wigs of various colors, and that he tends to purchase less expensive ones that look cheap because nicer more expensive order-made ones would not likely last long due to all constant putting on and taking off he does during events and other appearances. He also has said that although he uses the wigs as a joke to make people laugh, they also help him feel better and give him courage, and that some fans have told him that his performances do the same for them. He even credits his wigs as helping get married since he met his wife at a wedding reception for a fellow shogi professional in 2014. The two were seated at the same table and struck up a conversation. Later on his wife saw some online videos of his \\"wig performances\\" and found them to be very funny, the relationship grew, and the two were married a year later.

History An early mention of the parish was about 1200, when Gerald of Wales recorded a chapel there, subordinate to Nash parish. The Manor of Upton merged with that of Nash under the 14th century Malefants, who had built the castle probably in the 13th century. By the 16th century, the Bowen family owned the manor. The parish is marked on a 1578 parish map of the county. In the second half of the 18th century, Captain John Tasker of the East India Company purchased Upton Castle; among the eventual beneficiaries after his death were members of the Evans family. In 1833, Lewis, in his Topographical Dictionary of Wales, recorded that the parish was occupied by a single family of six inhabitants. At that time Nash-cum-Upton was a rectory in the non-adjoining Nash parish, to the south. Lewis described the former inhabitants of the castle and its dependencies as Maliphant (sic), then Bowen, then Evans. In 1872, Upton was described as a hamlet in Nash parish, with a population of 24 in three houses. It covered an area of , of which were water. Tasker Evans sold to Stanley Neale in 1927. The asking price was ¬£9,100. In 2004, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park said they would discontinue the upkeep of the gardens. In 2006 the estate was sold. In 2012, Channel 4's Time Team carried out an archaeological evaluation of the castle and chapel. Their evidence suggested the chapel was 11th or 12th century, subsequently altered. Modern maps show only Upton Farm, Upton Castle Gardens and the ruins of Upton Castle and Chapel. Upton Castle Upton Castle was the home of the Malefant family, and is still a private home. Its gardens are open to the public. Upton Chapel The chapel is dedicated to St. Giles, and is open to the public. It contains several important features including effigies of the Anglo-Norman Malefant family dating from the 13th to 15th centuries.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to thirty green or yellowish-green flowers. It was previously thought to occur in Victoria but records from that state are now recognised as P. roseum. Description Prasophyllum pallidum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and wide. Between fifteen and thirty five flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem long which reaches to a height of . The flowers are green or yellowish-green and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is swollen, realively large compared to the rest of the flower and stands out from the flowering stem. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and slightly dished. The lateral sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but narrower and are free from each other. The petals are long, about wide and curve forwards. The labellum is wedge-shaped to egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle. The edges of the labellum are crinkled and there is a pale green, fleshy callus along the centre of the labellum, extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs from September to November and is stimulated by earlier fires. Taxonomy and naming Prasophyllum pallidum was first formally described in 1930 by William Henry Nicholls and the description was published in The Victorian Naturalist from a specimen collected near Pomonal. The specific epithet (pallidum) is a Latin word meaning \\"ashen\\", \\"pale\\" or \\"wan\\". Specimens collected in Victoria as P. pallidum are now included in P. roseum. Distribution and habitat The pale leek orchid mostly grows in grassy forest from the Flinders Ranges to the Mount Lofty Ranges. Conservation Prasophyllum pallidum is listed \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and under the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972.

The event took place on August 1, 1996 at the Shiodome in Tokyo, Japan. The main event was a no ropes exploding barbed wire glass crush spider net double hell deathmatch between Mr. Pogo and the Puerto Rican Army leader Terry Funk. Funk won by knockout. The event also featured the tournament final for the newly created Independent Heavyweight Championship between Masato Tanaka and W*ING Kanemura. Kanemura defeated Tanaka to become the first Independent Heavyweight Champion. Background Terry Funk defeated Mr. Pogo in the main event. At 7th Anniversary Show, Puerto Rican Army members Mr. Pogo and Terry Funk defeated Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka in a one million yen no rope explosive barbed wire time bomb land mine double hell death match to win FMW's one million yens. After the event, Pogo and Tanaka participated in a tournament for the new FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship, in which Tanaka defeated Pogo in the quarter-final on May 27, 1996. After the match, Puerto Rican Army's manager V√≠ctor Qui√±ones slapped Pogo on the loss and Pogo took it as an insult and grabbed Qui√±ones and then The Headhunters laid out Pogo. As a result, Pogo turned face and joined the FMW team to feud with the Puerto Rican Army, leading to a match against Terry Funk at Summer Spectacular. Hayabusa was embarrassed for letting down FMW at 7th Anniversary Show and went into hiding. On June 28, the FMW team of Koji Nakagawa, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Super Leather and The Headhunters to win the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. After the match, Nakagawa spotted Hayabusa backstage watching the match and attacked him for leaving FMW in war against the Puerto Rican Army, until Tanaka and Kuroda held him back. The infuriated Nakagawa challenged Hayabusa to a match at Hayabusa's in-ring return at Summer Spectacular, which Hayabusa accepted. Masato Tanaka was the runner-up of the tournament of the new Independent Heavyweight Championship. A new FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship belt had been planned for Atsushi Onita to defend against Hayabusa in his retirement match at the 6th Anniversary Show in 1995 but the title belt was unavailable at the time and was finally shipped to the company in 1996 and the championship belt was used as a new world heavyweight championship, the FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship. A tournament was announced for the title with Hido, Hisakatsu Oya, Horace Boulder, Koji Nakagawa, Masato Tanaka, Mr. Pogo, Super Leather and W*ING Kanemura named as participants for the eight-man tournament and the final was set to take place at Summer Spectacular.

On June 24, Michinoku made his first title defense against Hayato Nanjyo, where he retained the title. After the match, Michinoku offered Nanjyo, a handshake but he refused to shake it and began feuding with Michinoku. On July 21, the team of Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Hayato Nanjyo and Koji Nakagawa defeated Taka Michinoku, Ricky Fuji and Toryu when Nanjyo mocked Michinoku by using Michinoku's Michinoku Driver II on Toryu for the win and then challenged Michinoku to a hair vs. hair match for the title at Summer Spectacular, which Michinoku accepted. At 7th Anniversary Show, Megumi Kudo defeated Combat Toyoda in a no ropes exploding barbed wire double hell deathmatch to win the FMW Independent and WWA World Women's Championship in Toyoda's retirement match. Toyoda held her retirement ceremony on June 28 and all the female wrestlers of FMW paid their homage to her. Later in the show, Shark Tsuchiya, Miwa Sato and Crusher Maedomari defeated Kudo, Kaori Nakayama and Aki Kambayashi and Kudo began her next feud with the Mad Dog Military, leading to Kudo defending her title against Mad Dog Military at Summer Spectacular. Event =Preliminary matches= Makuro Okamuto defeated Hideo Makimura in the opening match of the show by making him submit to a single legged Boston crab. Kaori Nakayama took on Miwa Sato in a match, which began with both women pulling each other's hair. Near the end of the match, Sato attempted to perform a backdrop suplex on Nakayama but Nakayama countered it into a pinfall attempt and then performed a Moonsault to win the match. Next was an eleven- man royal rumble match. Ricky Fuji and Hideki Hosaka were the first two participants. After the rest of the wrestlers got eliminated, Hido, The Gladiator and Tetsuhiro Kuroda were the final three participants remaining in the ring. Kuroda dropkicked Gladiator, allowing Hido to eliminate him over the top rope with a lariat. Hido and Kuroda battled each other and brought chairs into the ring. Hido delivered a Piledriver to Kuroda and followed it with a Moonsault to win the match. Taka Michinoku defended the FMW Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship against Hayato Nanjyo in a hair vs. hair match. Near the end of the match, both men blocked each other's attempts at the Michinoku Driver II and collapsed down on the mat. Michinoku quickly gained breath and performed a missile dropkick and followed it with a Michinoku Driver II to retain the title. After the match, Nanjyo handed Michinoku scissor to cut his hair to respect the pre-match stipulation and Michinoku showed respect by cutting just a bit of hair. W*ING Kanemura defeated Masato Tanaka in a tournament final to become the inaugural Independent Heavyweight Champion in the semi-main event. Hayabusa made his in- ring return to Summer Spectacular after his injury by defeating Koji Nakagawa at the event. Megumi Kudo defended the FMW Independent and WWA World Women's Championship against Mad Dog Military (Shark Tsuchiya, Bad Nurse Nakamura and Crusher Maedomari) in a handicap match. Mad Dog Military overpowered Kudo during the earlier part of the match. At one moment, Tsuchiya accidentally hit Nakamura with a barbed wire baseball bat intended for Kudo. As the match reached its climax, Tsuchiya handed a bat to Nakamura to hit Kudo with it but Nakamura turned on Tsuchiya by hitting her with the bat instead and Kudo grabbed Nakamura and delivered a Kudo Driver and a Thunder Fire Powerbomb to retain the title. After the match, Tsuchiya blew a fireball on Kudo. Hayabusa took on Koji Nakagawa in his in-ring return after recovering from his injury. Hayabusa executed his Firebird Splash and Falcon Arrow on Nakagawa but Nakagawa managed to survive in the match until Hayabusa performed a face kick which knocked both men down. The referee began to count and Hayabusa got up while Nakagawa failed to answer the referee's ten count and Hayabusa was awarded the win via knockout. Masato Tanaka and W*ING Kanemura competed in the finals of a tournament for the new FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship. Near the end of the match, Kanemura performed a low blow on Tanaka and ran off the ropes to receive a Rolling Elbow from Tanaka. Kanemura slowed down Tanaka with a lariat and then performed a Thunder Fire Powerbomb to get a near-fall. He attempted it again but Tanaka countered by backdropping him to the mat. Tanaka attempted another Rolling Elbow but Kanemura countered with two German suplexes. Tanaka made a comeback by hitting Kanemura with a Rolling Elbow and got a near-fall and then attempted the move again but Kanemura countered it with his own Rolling Elbow and Tanaka kicked out of the pinfall attempt. Kanemura weakened down Tanaka with two diving leg drops and then performed a Thunder Fire Powerbomb to win the title. =Main event match= Mr. Pogo took on Terry Funk in a no ropes exploding barbed wire glass crush spider net double hell deathmatch. Both men traded momentum until V√≠ctor Qui√±ones set a chair on fire and tossed it into the ring and Funk hit Pogo repeatedly with the flaming chair and then blew fire at him, causing Pogo to fall into the spider net, which exploded. Pogo became unconscious and Funk blew a fireball to knock him out for the win. Reception Stuart of Puroresu Central gave negative reviews to the event, considering it to be \\"one of the worst FMW major shows\\" between 1994 and 1998. He praised the Independent Heavyweight Championship match, the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship match and the main event match, with \\"The show was boring though, because some of the early matches were really dull and just plain bad.\\" According to him, the Tanaka/Kanemura encounter \\"was a great match of a style that has become more common in FMW as the years have gone by, relying less on garbage props and more on natural ability, blending the two nicely.\\" Aftermath The injuries suffered during his match at Summer Spectacular forced Mr. Pogo to temporarily retire from FMW. Atsushi Onita came out of retirement to join forces with Mr. Pogo and FMW to compete against Funk Masters of Wrestling at Year End Spectacular. Mr. Pogo suffered a severe injury that almost ended his career at Summer Spectacular. He continued to feud with Puerto Rican Army, which would become the Funk Masters of Wrestling. Lethal Weapon disbanded on September 15 when Hisakatsu Oya, Horace Boulder and The Gladiator turned on Ricky Fuji and joined Funk Masters of Wrestling. Pogo announced that he would retire at Year End Spectacular. Pogo begged his rival Atsushi Onita to come out of retirement and team with him in his retirement match, with Onita initially declining the offer and then joining Pogo in the war against Funk Masters of Wrestling. At Year End Spectacular, Onita made his in-ring return in Pogo's retirement match with Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda against the Funk Masters of Wrestling team of Terry Funk, Hisakatsu Oya and The Headhunters, which Onita's team won. Hayabusa and Koji Nakagawa's match was considered to be a disappointment and the two agreed to have a rematch on August 23, which Nakagawa won and then both men joined forces on the FMW team and put away their differences. Hayabusa regained FMW's yens from the Puerto Rican Army, which they had lost at the 7th Anniversary Show as the FMW team of Hayabusa, Koji Nakagawa, Masato Tanaka and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated the Puerto Rican Army team of Hisakatsu Oya, Super Leather and The Headhunters in a two million yen on a pole match on September 15. Hayabusa would begin a losing streak in singles matches, which would end with his win over The Great Sasuke at Year End Spectacular.

Plot summary =Introduction= A young woman decides she no longer wants to work as a street walker in Chicago, now she wants to follow her dreams as an actress in Hollywood. The main cast members are Clara/Carla Brown ‚Äì Juanita Brown, Brisco ‚Äì Eric Mason, Ben ‚Äì Rockne Tarkington, Skully ‚Äì Damu King, Joyce ‚Äì Diane Holden, Phil ‚Äì Noah Keen, and Sam ‚Äì Al Lewis. The writers are Daniel Cady and Howard Ostroff. The movie was filmed in Hollywood. =Plot= Clara is a beautiful young woman who aspired to be an actress. Clara saved up some money from working in a club and her boyfriend being a pimp, so they can both move to Hollywood. Her boyfriend thought that being an actress in Hollywood was a waste of time. The next morning Clara packed her bags and left for Hollywood. As she was standing at the bus stop waiting for the bus, plenty men were stopping to pay her for her job but she ignored them. One particular man stopped while she was being watched by a police officer and she took off with him. The two had coffee together and Clara went to use the bathroom before they were supposed to leave together. When Clara came back the money in her purse was gone and her luggage was left in the parking spot where the car was parked. Clara did not let that stop her, she soon found a way to Hollywood. While looking for work Clara met a good friend named Joyce. Joyce taught Clara all the ins and outs about Hollywood, even introducing her to her manager. Although during Clara's time as an actress she was raped, Clara did not let that stop her. She soon became a well-known actress/writer. =Background= One of the reasons this movie wasn't your typical 1970s person top pick is that it was a low-budget movie, according to the \\"Every 70s Movie\\" article. Since the movie was set at a low budget this meant that the actors and actresses wouldn't be too great. As stated in the \\"Every 70s Movie\\" article, \\"Yet Black Starlet meets and nearly exceeds the very low expectations set by its subject matter and title.\\" Everyone in that time period just knew it was going to be a terrible movie because no one wanted to give up more funds for it forcing the producers to find casts willing to work for a very low wage. According to \\"Every 70s Movie\\", \\"What makes Black Starlet more or less palatable are the moments wedged between exploitation-flick extremes.\\" =Social norms= In the 1970s, it was a time when everyone was fighting for equality, African Americans, women, gays, and lesbians. The book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom stated that during the 1970s \\"Very few films attempted to explore a black woman's tensions or aspirations or to examine the dynamics of sexual politics within the black community.\\" Women were and still are experiencing sexual abuse. To further the fight for equality even if the industry felt no one would be interested in hearing about a black woman's struggle. Women were constantly put down about their acting talent but that was all put to rest when the movie Sparkle was introduced. It too was a low budget film that everyone thought would not take off anywhere, but soon became an appealing movie. =Womanism= The fight for women's rights: the 1970s was a time when women were campaigning women's rights. In 1972, Congress approved the Equal Rights Amendment. This amendment states ‚ÄúEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.‚Äù This was a time where women opened abortion clinics and rape centers. According to the book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom, \\"It was the 1970s, that slick trendy, and contradictory era that led opened with politics and social issues very much on the minds of most Americans.\\" The 1970s was an era for Black women to show that they were more than just a stereotype, the could act as well. In the book it discusses, \\"What with the Black Nationalist movement, the youth movement, and the rising tide of feminism, the 1970s looked as if it, like the 1960s, would be propelled along by political activism. The movies gave Blacks a way to express their feelings without backlash. With this being said the 1970s era was different, different how? Bucks and a Black Movie Boom states that \\"Then, too, while the 1970s opened with films with some political heat, the age closed with movies that were increasingly more escapist.\\" In this era, Blacks were looking for a movie that shed light to America's racial conflicts and issues such as actors who showed power, who showed they weren't afraid of standing up for what was right. The 1970s is explained to be, \\"No other period in black movie history, however, has been quite so energetic or important as the frenetic 1970s,\\" as described in the book Bucks and a Black Movie Boom. This era, was like no other time era. It was a moment for anyone, blacks included, to rise above the pre-existing weak stereotypes. =Discussion of context= The soundtrack to the movie is soulful music coming from Joe Hinton and Dee Irvin. Songs include ‚ÄúUp is Down‚Äù, ‚ÄúHollywood Faces‚Äù, ‚ÄúFire Sign‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGo on and Find Your Star‚Äù. =Conclusion= As far as information about the main characters, there is not much information about Juanita Brown and Rockne Tarkington died in 2015. It is said that Tarkington has appeared in many movies. As for Brown, she has appeared in a few movies as stated in the article \\"Every 70s Movie\\". Yet nothing else has appeared about the actress. This film is listed as a blaxploitation film on Wikipedia.

Jennie Scott Scheuber (1860‚Äì1944) was an American librarian who pioneered the public library movement in Texas. A prominent Fort Worth, Texas civic leader, she was instrumental in the formation of the Fort Worth public library system and the first art museum in Fort Worth.  Early life  Jennie Scott was born January 6, 1860 in Plaquemine, Louisiana to Maurice and Louise Imlar Scott, immigrants from Alsace and Leipzig, respectively. The family moved to New Orleans after the Civil War and relocated to Fort Worth, Texas in 1873, the same year that city was incorporated; by 1877 the Scotts were proprietors of the Cosmopolitan Hotel on Fort Worth's Main Street. Largely educated at home, Jennie Scott was a member of the Thespian Club and an officer in its successor, the El Paso Literary and Music Society, as a teen. In 1881, she married Charles Scheuber, also an immigrant from Alsace, who operated a wholesale liquor business; the couple's only son, Frank, was born the following year. In 1889, Jennie Scott Scheuber was named secretary of the Texas Spring Palace women's organization, responsible for decorating the building's White and Gold Room. She was a charter member of the Women's Wednesday Club, becoming the organization's literary director in 1890, and helped form the Associated Charities organization the same year. She was also an active member of The Woman's Club of Fort Worth, though she was critical of some of the club's rules, which she considered too old-fashioned to continue attracting new members.  Career  = The Fort Worth Public Library Association and Carnegie Public Library = In April 1892, the Fort Worth Public Library Association was formed at the Scheuber home. With thirteen women as trustees and no financial backing, the group was unable to gain traction in its goal of building Fort Worth's first public library and art gallery. After the sudden death of her husband, Jennie Scott Scheuber moved to Massachusetts so her son could attend the Worcester Academy; while living in Worcester, she worked in a bookstore in order to learn the trade. Back in Fort Worth, the Fort Worth Public Library Association grew to include 426 members and secured a $50,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie to open its long-awaited public library, to be called the Carnegie Public Library of Fort Worth. In 1900, Jennie Scott Scheuber was chosen to be the city's first public librarian.American Women: The Official Who's who Among the Women of the Nation, Volumes 1-3, Richard Blank Publishing Company, 1935 In preparation, she enrolled in the Amherst College Summer School of Library Economy, the only formal library science education she would undertake in her career. The Carnegie Public Library of Fort Worth opened on October 17, 1901 and continued under Scheuber's direction until her retirement in 1938.Texas Libraries, Volumes 46-47, Texas Library and Historical Commission, 1985 Jennie Scott Scheuber was instrumental in extending the public library's reach to other local communities. During World War I, she was the acting librarian at Camp Bowie and maintained small libraries at the army hospital, YMCA, and Knights of Columbus Hall. In 1921, she led the opening of the library's first branch in Fort Worth's Northside. The following year, Scheuber and the Fort Worth Public Library Association formed the Tarrant County Free Library to provide library services to smaller towns in the then largely rural area. = Fort Worth Museum of Art = Opening a public art gallery had been one of Jennie Scott Scheuber's goals since the Fort Worth Public Library Association was formed in 1892. By 1904, the second floor of the Carnegie Public Library was being used as gallery space for exhibitions sponsored by Fort Worth women's clubs. In 1910, the Fort Worth Art Association was formed within the Fort Worth Public Library Association, with Scheuber named ex officio secretary of the organization, and established the Fort Worth Museum of Art. The museum held exhibits in the Carnegie Public Library's art gallery until it officially separated from the library in 1939, shortly after Scheuber's retirement. The former Carnegie Public Library Art Gallery has undergone several name changes and shifts in mission. The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, as it is now known, is a world-class museum housed in a building designed by Tadao Ando in the Fort Worth Cultural District. \\"The Modern\\" is the first art museum in Fort Worth and is the oldest art museum in Texas. = Other Organizations = In addition to managing the Carnegie Public Library for 38 years, Scheuber was involved with several other civic causes and professional organizations. She was an active participant in the women's suffrage movement as an early member of the League of Women Voters, a member of the Fort Worth Equal Suffrage Association, and a delegate to Texas's Democratic convention in 1918 and 1920. Scheuber was the first woman president of the Texas Library Association; vice president of the American Federation of Arts from 1911 to 1917; and chairman of the board of the Fort Worth Children's Hospital, which she helped found in 1919. In 1928, she was presented with a portrait by American Impressionist painter Robert Vonnoh, which now hangs in Fort Worth's Central Library; she was honored as a library pioneer by the Texas Library Association in 1935.  Death  Scheuber suffered a heart attack in April 1944 and died May 2, 1944. Per her wishes, she was given a private funeral in her Arlington Heights apartment and buried in Fort Worth's Oakwood Cemetery.

Both men were tall in stature with athletic backgrounds (Ben was an Olympian with the Canadian rowing team in 1936) and served in the Royal Air Force during World War II. While both were stationed in England, they discovered professional wrestling and set about entering the profession soon thereafter. In pursuit, they travelled to San Francisco after the war and rose to prominence in promoter Joe Malcewicz's territory as both single's and tag team wrestlers. In the mid-1950s the Sharpe Brothers also began competing for Rikidozan's newly formed Japan Wrestling Association, becoming one of the most revered tag teams in Japanese history. Mike continued to wrestled as a single's competitor after Ben's retirement and his son \\"Iron\\" Mike Sharpe, Jr. entered the business as well. The Sharpe Brothers are remembered as a tag team that was able to rise to headline status in an established and respected territory and also helping to establish a new one (in Japan). The duo have been inducted into various Halls of Fame, including the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum, Class of 2010. Early life Mike Sharpe in 1962 Ben Sharpe (18 March 1916 ‚Äì 21 November 2001) was six when his brother Mike (11 July 1922 ‚Äì 11 August 1988) was born. Their father was a detective sergeant with the Hamilton City Police force and they had four sisters. Both Sharpe brothers attended Westdale Secondary School in Hamilton, Ontario and were accomplished athletes, particularly Ben who had competed in the 1936 Summer Olympics as part of the Canadian rowing team, where he was the flag-bearer and shook hands with Adolf Hitler. Ben would write home to his family regularly and warned that he felt a war was brewing in Europe. Ben had also worked for an elevator company in Hamilton. At the outbreak of World War II, both brothers enlisted in the Canadian armed forces. Ben has originally enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force but at 6'5\\" he was too large to fit into a cockpit and was instead stationed in England as a physical fitness instructor. Mike entered the Royal Canadian Airforce when he met the age requirement and, again due to his size, he was tasked with being an armourer, often loading bombs onto planes. Professional wrestling career =England and Hamilton= Ben had already dipped his toes in the wrestling business briefly back in Hamilton and when Mike arrived in England Ben saw potential to pursue a career as a tag team with his brother. The brothers met Lord James Blears while stationed in England and began wrestling during the war. At the end of the war, Mike and Ben returned to their native Canada and wrestled in Ontario before relocating to San Francisco. =Northern California= Working for promoters Frank and Joe Malcewicz, the Sharpe Brothers became the stars of the territory. They captured their first NWA World Tag Team Championship on 9 May 1950, defeating Hard Boiled Haggerty & Ray Eckert. They dominated the tag team scene for the next decade, winning the NWA World Tag Team Championship there on 18 occasions. Ben also captured the NWA Hawaii Heavyweight Championship during this time, defeating Bobby Managoff on 23 August 1953. \\"Had I been in a position of power in any territory, they would have been my main eventers...they were just fantastic,\\" Bob Orton Sr. remarked on the Sharpes in 2002. The brothers were mainstays in the San Francisco territory and primarily performed there for a decade. \\"Joe Malcewicz had them pretty well tied up\\" Gene Kiniski said of their tenure in San Francisco, \\"they...kept feeding them different talent.\\" =Various NWA territories= While Northern California became their home territory, the brothers also captured championship in other promotions, particularly St. Louis and their native Hamilton, Ontario. They won NWA Tag Team gold for NWA Chicago on 17 October 1953 and for NWA Indianapolis on 16 September 1951. =Japan= The California territories offered access to Japan for those who could draw crowds and the Sharpe Brothers took up this opportunity when Japanese promoters came asking. Television was a relatively new medium in Japan in 1954 with few Japanese people owning a television set. In February 1954 Rikidozan and Masahiko Kimura face the Sharpe Brothers, which was seen by thousands via Japanese TV, with many people viewing in front of shop windows. As televisions became more affordable, Rikidozan capitalised on this and established himself as one of the countries first true TV stars. The Sharpe Brothers became the popular \\"foreign\\" team and were regularly interviewed on Japanese TV, even into their retirements. Both men appreciated Japanese culture and one of Ben's children, Riki, was named in honour of Rikidozan. =Ben's retirement= In 1962, Ben retired from the wrestling business and Mike continued to wrestle, working for promotions he previously had not done as a tag team. He captured titles after Ben's retirement, including the NWA (San Francisco) Pacific Coast Heavyweight title in 1960, the WWA International Television Tag titles in 1961 and the All Asia Tag Team titles in 1962. =Later years= After retiring from in-ring competition, Ben entered into various business ventures, including opening a bar in San Francisco and a restaurant in Colma. The wear and tear he accumulated from his wrestling career took their toll on Ben however and he was confined to a wheelchair for the last 14 years of his life. After contracting a leg infection and developing a fever, Ben went to bed at his son Michael's home on Kingsburg on 21 November 2001 and died in his sleep at the age of 85. He had six children. Mike wrestled his last match in 1964. After his in-ring career, he got into brewing for Anheuser-Busch in Van Nuys. He also became self-taught in welding, putting together small wrestling rings for children. Ben's brother-in-law Jake Isbister has commented on Mike's charity, stating that he \\"was generous to a fault. Anyone with a hard-luck story could count on him for a meal and a bed\\". Wrestling wear and tear caught up with Mike as it did Ben and he suffered various ailments in his later years. While on his way to his sister-in-law's funeral in Palo Alto on 11 August 1988 Mike had a heart attack and died at 66 years of age. His son, Mike Jr., better known as \\"Iron\\" Mike Sharpe, would later join Vince McMahon's nationally expanding World Wrestling Federation.

It was The Crickets' first release in the 1970s, and marked the band's embrace of their legacy as Buddy Holly's backing band. The album is a concept album of nostalgia for the 1950s, consisting mostly of songs written by Holly and framed by the new retrospectively-minded title track. Originally released as an LP record in December 1970, the album was re-released on CD by in 2000. Background With the departure of bassist Joe B. Mauldin, and singer Jerry Naylor, who embarking on a career as a solo artist, the Crickets seemed to be on hiatus after their few releases in 1965. The remaining members remained active in the music business. Guitarist [Sonny Curtis] and drummer [J.I. Allison], billed as The Camps, Curtis recorded the novelty single \\"The Ballad of Batman\\" and \\"Batmobile,\\" on the Parkway label in 1965. Allison and Curtis worked as session musicians, Allison toured with country singer Roger Miller for two years and Curtis released two solo records on the Viva label. Keyboardist Glen D. Hardin joined Elvis Presley's TCB Band in 1969. The August 1968 single, \\"Million Dollar Movie\\" (Curtis) and \\"A Million Miles Apart\\" (Glen D. Hardin), was the only Crickets release of new material since early 1965. The Crickets signed to Barnaby records, a subsidiary of CBS records founded by singer Andy Williams primarily to manage releases from the Cadence archive, the famed label of the Everly Brothers releases. (Williams had enjoyed success with Cricket Sonny Curtis' \\"A Fool Never Learns\\" and had recorded other Curtis songs including \\"Walk Right Back.\\" Additionally, Williams-Price Agency managed The Mary Tyler Moore Show, for which Sonny Curtis penned the theme song \\"Love is All Around\\" in summer 1970.) In 1970, Curtis and Allison sang backing vocals on Eric Clapton's first solo record, which was produced by Delaney Bramlett. Bramlett would produce the first two songs on Rockin' 50s Rock'n'Roll with Clapton playing lead guitar. The album proceeds like a concept album with all of songs the fading into one another, like the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The opening song \\"Rockin' 50s Rock'n'Roll\\" serves as an overture stating the album's theme of celebrating 1950s rock'n'roll music. It is reprised at the album's closing. Aside from the opening song, the album consists of new versions of songs made famous by former bandmember Buddy Holly. In this way, the album tapped into an emerging trend in Western popular culture of the 1970s of nostalgia for the 1950s, in which figures like Buddy Holly were iconic.

The bridge was built by the Works Projects Administration in 1938‚Äì40. It was used into the 21st century, and in 2008 was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. However, it was later found inadequate for the volume and weight of traffic that it carried, and demolished in 2016 or 2017. It was delisted in 2018. Construction In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the Works Projects Administration (WPA) launched numerous public-works projects to provide employment during the Great Depression. In Kansas, these projects included the construction of hundreds of small bridges, often using locally quarried limestone. Bridge 650, built across a tributary of Beaver Creek, was one of several such bridges in Barton County. Construction began in 1938. Concrete work was completed in 1940, attested by the inscription \\"WPA 1940\\" stamped into the concrete curb. The bridge consisted of two spans, divided by a central support. The foundation, wingwalls, and central support were made of cut limestone blocks held together by mortar; the deck and guardrails were concrete. The deck was long, with spans between supports, and wide. The base of the deck was above ground level. Demolition The bridge remained in use well into the 21st century. In 2007, it was noted that there was \\"significant deterioration\\" in the mortar joints in the limestone, and that the wingwalls, which extend along the banks and protect the bridge during high flows, were \\"temporarily shored and in need of repair\\". In 2008, the bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) under the name \\"Bridge #650 - Federal Aid Highway System Bridge\\". At that time, it was suggested that WPA bridges like 650 might attract tourists on the Kansas Wetlands and Wildlife Scenic Byway, a corridor running through Barton County and connecting Cheyenne Bottoms and Quivira National Wildlife Refuge. It was also hoped that the NRHP listing might bring in grant money to repair and maintain the bridge. The longed-for grant money did not arrive. In 2013, the bridge was inspected and evaluated as \\"structurally deficient\\", with the substructure rated as \\"poor\\". In 2014, the Barton County Commission, noting that the bridge was inadequate for the volume of traffic that it carried, including heavy farm and oilfield equipment, and estimating that repairing the bridge would cost some $50,000 more than replacing it, voted to replace it with a reinforced concrete box. In 2016, complying with federal regulations concerning the demolition of historic structures, the Commission agreed to preserve four other NRHP-listed native- stone bridges in the county, and to provide photographic documentation of Bridge 650. Later that year, the county accepted a bid of about $130,000 to replace the bridge and to widen two existing concrete boxes nearby. By late 2017, the bridge was no more. Bridge 222, similar to 650 Two of the surviving NRHP-listed WPA stone bridges, designated Bridge 222 and Bridge 640, are about a mile (about a kilometer and a half) south of the site of Bridge 650. The two bridges are described as \\"very similar in design and dimension\\" to 650.

The tomb has eight life-sized pleurants, represented as solemn and hooded pallbearers, each wearing a heavy black coat as they carry Philippe's recumbent effigy towards his grave.Sadler (2015), 22 Philippe is dressed in armor and a heraldic tunic, with his hands folded in prayer. The tomb is made of polychromed limestone, paint, gold and lead, it measures 181 (width) √ó 260 (height) √ó 167 (depth) cm. The tomb was stolen during the French Revolution, and after changing a number of hands was positioned in private gardens in mansions in Dijon in the 19th century. It has been in the collection of the Mus√©e du Louvre since 1899, where it is on permanent display. Description Philip the Bold (1363‚Äì1404) commissioned the first of the Burgundian tombs in the latter part of the 14th century. He hired the Dutch sculptor Claus Sluter, whose distinctive style in which many small pleurants are positioned surrounding the effigy was copied for the next century. Philippe Pot was Philip the Bold's godson, and royal steward and Grand Seneschal to the Dukes of Burgundy. He was raised at the Burgundian court, where he was educated. His tomb follows the tradition of the earliest ducal tombs; Sluter's influence is evident by the presence of pleurants.Hourihane (2012), 357 View Philippe Pot reposes on a limestone plate or slab, and is dressed in a knightly helmet, tunic and armor with a gilded breastplate. His head rests on a cushion, his eyes are open and his hands are clasped in prayer. A sword lies to his side while a lion rests at his feet.Jugie (2010), 52 The eight mourners carrying his body are carved in black stone, and dressed in full-length black-hooded habits. Each bows their head in grief, and each bears an individually designed gilded heraldic shield, which may refer to Philippe's lineage, making the monument of the \\"Kinship tomb\\" type.McGee Morganstern (2000), p. 8 Their poise gives the impression of the slow movement of a funeral procession.Mayade, St√©phanie. \\"Tombeau de Philippe Pot ‚Äì Mus√©e du Louvre, Paris\\".

Although the monument is the last known tomb of the Burundian style, it influenced later funerary artworks. The sculptor transformed the conventional size and placement of pleurants, which had been relatively small figures standing in niches around the sarcophagus. Its influence is evidenced by the similar tombs of Louis de Savoisy (d. 1515) and Jacques de M√¢lain (d. 1527).Sadler (2015), 23 Attribution Philippe's effigy The monument was commissioned, perhaps by Philippe himself, to stand over his grave in the north arm of the chapel's transept. The artists and craftsmen involved in its production have not been identified, although the French sculptor Antoine Le Moiturier (active between 1482 and 1502) is often suggested as likely to have created the pleurants, given the similarity of the facial types to identified works of his, as well as, according to art historian Colum Hourihane, the \\"unusually rigid drapery\\".\\"Tomb of Philip Pot, Grand Seneschal of Burgundy\\".

W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 75 His life is known entirely from inscriptions. Priscus was the son of Quintus Pompeius Falco, consul of 108, and Sosia Polla.Ronald Syme, \\"Ummidius Quadratus, Capax Imperii\\", Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, 83 (1979), p. 295 Earlier writers had confused him with his son, Quintus Pompeius Senecio Sosius Priscus, but a fragmentary inscription from Rome allowed experts to separate the evidence pertaining to each. By his lifetime, his branch of the Sosii had been granted Patrician status.  Life  The cursus honorum of Priscus can be recovered from two inscriptions: the fragmentary one from Rome mentioned above, and one from Bononia in Aemilia. If we can trust the order of offices on this inscription to reflect the order they were held, his first recorded office was sevir equitum Romanorum of the annual review of the equites at Rome. Next was his membership as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals. He then became a quaestor, which was important in providing the office holder admission to the Senate. This was followed by his admission to the Roman priesthoods of sodales Hadrianales then the College of Pontiffs; the latter may have transpired prior to his accession to the consulate. He was also made a member of the sodales Antoniniani around that time. As a member of the Patrician order, Priscus acceded to the consulate two years after he was praetor. After his consulate, Priscus became a member of the comites of emperor Marcus Aurelius. If the restoration of the inscription from Rome can be trusted, Priscus also was decorated with dona militaria, possibly as a staff officer; McDermott suggests that this \\"was at the time of the northern wars between 167 and 180. I suspect his duties were less warlike than those of his co-eval son-in-law Pontius.\\"William C. McDermott, \\"Stemmata quid faciunt?

The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. Location and access Boundary of North Creek wildland as identified by the Wilderness Society. The area, located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 7 miles northeast of Buchanan, Virginia, is between the Blue Ridge Parkway on the east, Middle Creek Road (Rt. 3101) on the west and Parkers Gap Road (Va 612) on the north. The Forest Service 2015 Motor Vehicle Use Map shows roads and trails in the forest and gives the type of vehicle allowed on each route with possible seasonal restrictions.

A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The North Creek wildland is covered by USGS topographic maps Arnold Valley and Peaks of Otter. A key to the topographic maps for the northern half of the Jefferson National Forest is in the gallery below. Natural history The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years ago. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. The wildland contains parts of two special biological areas, Apple Orchard Mountain and Camping Ridge. Special biological areas have large biological diversity with rare fauna and significant forest communities. There are over 1300 acres of possible old growth trees, with a large section near Floyd Mountain and the Cornelius Creek Shelter and smaller tracts scattered throughout the valley. Much of the area on the eastern side has trees at least 140 years old. The area includes part of the 5200-acres North Creek Special Management Area, a designation intended to protect hiking and recreation resources, fauna such as songbirds that depend on interior forest habitat, and the creek which is eligible for protection under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. Large infestations of invasive species, such as tree of heaven, are found throughout the area, especially in places that have been clearcut. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.Virginia Stream Classification: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: June 18, 2017 North Creek and Cornelius Creek are ranked as a class ii trout streams. To protect the creek for future generations, North Creek has been designated as an Exceptional State Water (Tier III), thus prohibiting new or increased point source discharges. Topography At an elevation of 4206 feet, Apple Orchard Mountain dominates the region. It is the highest elevation on the Appalachian Trail within 200 miles. The name comes from the weathered northern red oaks that give the appearance of a deserted orchard. The headwaters of North Creek are within the wildland. The creek flows along the base of the southern slope of Pine Mountain into Jennings Creek. Cornelius Creek, between Floyd Mountain and Backbone Ridge, flows into North Creek. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine their potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The North Creek wildland was not included in the inventoried roadless areas, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. There have been numerous proposed timber sales in the area. Notice for the Stave Hollow-Colon Hollow-Thomas Mountain Timbers sale was given in 1993. The Parkers Gap timber sale of 145 acres, with construction of spur roads, was approved in 2003. Environmental groups objected to the sale because of its location in the Peaks of Otter salamander conservation area, the habitat of one of the rarest salamanders in North America. The project was completed in 2010 with 106 acres actually logged.

However, some aircraft maintenance professionals remain wary of the technology and its ability to properly catch potential dangers. Argentine Army \\"Lip√°n M3\\" UAV,2008 A helicopter UAV has been proposed to accompany a future NASA Mars rover mission. Investigators believe a solar- powered craft would be able to fly for a few minutes at a time despite the thin atmosphere of the planet, and help the rover scout out interesting destinations. =Military= UAVs are used by a broad range of military forces, from Argentina to the US and also by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). As of January 2014, the U.S. military operated 7,362 RQ-11B Ravens; 145 AeroVironment RQ-12A Wasps; 1,137 AeroVironment RQ-20A Pumas; 306 RQ-16 T-Hawk small UAS; 246 Predators and MQ-1C Grey Eagles; 126 MQ-9 Reapers; 491 RQ-7 Shadows and 33 RQ-4 Global Hawk large systems. The MQ-9 Reaper costs $12 million while a manned F-22 costs over $120 million. ISIS announced a \\"Unmanned Aircraft of the Mujahideen\\" unit in January 2017 and use drones for both reconnaissance and to drop bombs. Reconnaissance The Tu-141 \\"Swift\\" reusable Soviet reconnaissance UAV is intended for reconnaissance to a depth of several hundred kilometers from the front line at supersonic speeds. The Tu-123 \\"Hawk\\" is a supersonic long-range reconnaissance UAV intended for conducting photographic and signals intelligence to a distance of 3200 km; it was produced beginning in 1964. The La-17P (UAV) is a reconnaissance UAV produced since 1963. In 1945 the Soviet Union began producing \\"doodlebug\\". 43 Soviet/Russian UAV models are known. In 2013, the U.S. Navy launched a UAV from a submerged submarine, the first step to \\"providing mission intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to the U.S. Navy's submarine force.\\" Turkish forces have used the Bayraktar Tactical UAS for reconnaissance during operations in northern Syria. Attack Predator launching a Hellfire missile UAVs avoid potential diplomatic embarrassment when a manned aircraft is shot down and the pilots captured. MQ-1 Predator UAVs armed with Hellfire missiles have been used by the U.S. as platforms for hitting ground targets. Armed Predators were first used in late 2001, mostly aimed at assassinating high-profile individuals (terrorist leaders, etc.) inside Afghanistan. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have used drones, adapting UAVs bought online, to drop explosives, primarily using quadcopters. Other groups in Syria are also thought to have used UAVs in attacks. A swarm of drones armed with bombs attacked Russian bases in western Syria in early January 2018. =Defense against UAVs= The US armed forces have no defense against low-level UAV attack, but the Joint Integrated Air and Missile Defense Organization is working to repurpose existing systems. Two German companies are developing 40-kW lasers to damage UAVs. Other systems still include the OpenWorks Engineering Skywall and the Battelle DroneDefender.anti- UAV/ In late 2017, Russia established a ground-based unit to combat UAVs by jamming their controlling signals. They used jamming and anti-aircraft fire to defend against a swarm attack in Syria in early January 2018. Targets for military training Since 1997, the US military has used more than 80 F-4 Phantoms converted into UAVs as aerial targets for combat training of human pilots. The F-4s were supplemented in September 2013 with F-16s as more realistically maneuverable targets. = Demining = Since January 2016 British scientists are developing UAVs with advanced imaging technology to more cheaply and effectively map and speed up the clearing of minefields. The Find A Better Way charity, working since 2011 to advance technologies that will enable safer and more efficient clearance of landmines, teamed up with scientists at the University of Bristol to develop UAVs fit with hyperspectral imaging technology that can quickly identify landmines buried in the ground. John Fardoulis, project researcher from Bristol University states that \\"the maps [their] UAVs will generate should help deminers focus on the places where mines are most likely to be found\\". Their intended UAVs will be able to perform flyovers and gather images at various wavelengths which, according to Dr John Day from the University of Bristol, could indicate explosive chemicals seeping from landmines into the surrounding foliage as \\"chemicals in landmines leak out and are often absorbed by plants, causing abnormalities\\" which can be detected as \\"living plants have a very distinctive reflection in the near infrared spectrum, just beyond human vision, which makes it possible to tell how healthy they are\\". The Dutch Mine Kafon project, led by designer Massoud Hassani is working on a UAV system that can quickly detect and clear land mines. The unmanned airborne de-mining system called Mine Kafon Drone uses a three step process to autonomously map, detect and detonate land mines. It flies above potentially dangerous areas, generating a 3D map, and uses a metal detector to pinpoint the location of mines. The UAV can then place a detonator above the mines using its robotic gripping arm, before retreating to a safe distance. The firm claims its UAV is safer, 20 times faster and up to 200 times cheaper than current technologies and might clear mines globally in 10 years. The project raised funds on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter with their goal set at ‚Ç¨70,000 and receiving over ‚Ç¨100,000 above it. = Civil = Interspect UAS B 3.1 octocopter for commercial aerial cartographic purposes and 3D mapping Civil UAV FOX-C8-HD AltiGator Civil uses include aerial crop surveys, aerial photography, search and rescue, inspection of power lines and pipelines,Abdessameud, Abdelkader andAbdelhamid Tayebi. 2013.

US government agencies use UAVs such as the RQ-9 Reaper to patrol borders, scout property and locate fugitives. One of the first authorized for domestic use was the ShadowHawk in Montgomery County, Texas SWAT and emergency management offices. Private citizens and media organizations use UAVs for surveillance, recreation, news-gathering, or personal land assessment. In February 2012, an animal rights group used a MikroKopter hexacopter to film hunters shooting pigeons in South Carolina. The hunters then shot the UAV down. In 2014, a UAV was used to successfully locate a man with dementia, who was missing for 3 days.  Archaeology  In Peru, archaeologists used UAVs to speed up survey work and protect sites from squatters, builders and miners. Small UAVs helped researchers produce three-dimensional models of Peruvian sites instead of the usual flat maps ‚Äì and in days and weeks instead of months and years. \\"You can go up three metres and photograph a room, 300 metres and photograph a site, or you can go up 3,000 metres and photograph the entire valley.\\" UAVs have replaced expensive and clumsy small planes, kites and helium balloons. UAVs costing as little as ¬£650 have proven useful. In 2013, UAVs flew over Peruvian archaeological sites, including the colonial Andean town Machu Llacta above sea level. The UAVs had altitude problems in the Andes, leading to plans to make a UAV blimp. In Jordan, UAVs were used to discover evidence of looted archaeological sites. In September 2014, UAVs were used for 3D mapping of the above-ground ruins of Aphrodisias and the Gallo-Roman remains in Switzerland. On 6 February 2017 it was reported that scientists from the UK and Brazil discovered hundreds of ancient earthworks similar to those at Stonehenge in the Amazon rainforest with the use of UAVs.

In 2013, in a research project of DHL, a small quantity of medicine was delivered via a UAV. Initial attempts at commercial use of UAVs, such as the Tacocopter company for food delivery, were blocked by FAA regulation. A 2013 announcement that Amazon was planning deliveries using UAVs was met with skepticism. In 2014, the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates announced that the UAE planned to launch a fleet of UAVsKerr, Simon (11 February 2014) UAE to develop fleet of drones to deliver public services, The Financial Times, World News, Retrieved 12 February 2014 to deliver official documents and supply emergency services at accidents.Sleiman, Mirna (10 February 2014) Aerial ID card renewal: UAE to use drones for government services Reuters, Retrieved 12 February 2014 Google revealed in 2014 it had been testing UAVs for two years. The Google X program aims to produce UAVs that can deliver items. 16 July 2015, A NASA Langley fixed-wing Cirrus SR22 aircraft, flown remotely from the ground, operated by NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton and a hexacopter UAV delivered pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies to an outdoor free clinic at the Wise County Fairgrounds, Virginia. The aircraft picked up 10 pounds of pharmaceuticals and supplies from an airport in Tazewell County in southwest Virginia and delivered the medicine to the Lonesome Pine Airport in Wise County. The aircraft had a pilot on board for safety. The supplies went to a crew, which separated the supplies into 24 smaller packages to be delivered by small, unmanned UAV to the free clinic, during multiple flights over two hours. A company pilot controlled the hexacopter, which lowered the pharmaceuticals to the ground by tether. Health care workers distributed the medications to appropriate patients. The Uvionix Nksy aerial delivery service is planning to allow local shops to deliver goods from a UAV. The company wants to deliver fast food, beer, coffee, soda, electronics, prescriptions and personal care products. Conservation ShadowView Eco Ranger In 2011, Lian Pin Koh and Serge Wich conceived the idea of using UAVs for conservation-related applications, before founding ConservationDrones in 2012. ConservationDrones works with NGOs, research organizations, and governments to collect environmental data through drone usage. They also work to provide low cost UAVs to these organizations, especially in developing countries, for as little as $2500. UAV usage in conservation is able to alleviate many of the challenges facing conservationists on foot, such as \\"the large size of species‚Äô geographic ranges, low population densities, inaccessible habitat, elusive behavior and sensitivity to disturbance.\\"Gonzalez, Luis et al. ‚ÄúUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Artificial Intelligence Revolutionizing Wildlife Monitoring and Conservation.‚Äù Sensors 16.12 (2016): 97. Crossref. Web. By 2012 the International Anti-Poaching Foundation was using UAVs. A whale conservation UAV capable of collecting blowhole mucus into a sterile petri dish was put into use in January 2018 following its development by researchers at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. UAVs have a particular role in anti-poaching activities. In June 2012, World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) announced it would begin using UAVs in Nepal to aid conservation efforts following a successful trial of two aircraft in Chitwan National Park. The global wildlife organization planned to train ten personnel to use the UAVs, with operational use beginning in the fall. In August 2012, UAVs were used by members of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in Namibia to document the annual seal cull. In December 2013, the Falcon UAV was selected by the Namibian Government and WWF to help combat rhinoceros poaching. The UAVs will operate in Etosha National Park and will use implanted RFID tags. In 2012, the WWFund supplied two FPV Raptor 1.6 UAVs to Nepal National Parks. These UAVs were used to monitor rhinos, tigers and elephants and deter poachers.\\"New Technology to Fight Wildlife Crime\\" (12 September 2012). World Wildlife Fund Stories.

A spokesman for Privacy International said that \\"licensing and permission for UAVs is only on the basis of health and safety, without considering whether privacy rights are violated.\\" CAA rules prohibit flying a UAV within 50 m of a person or vehicle. In Pennsylvania, Showing Animals Respect and Kindness used UAVs to monitor people shooting at pigeons for sport. One of their UAVs was shot down by hunters. In March 2013, UAV conservation nonprofit ShadowView, founded by former members of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, worked with antihunting charity the League Against Cruel Sports to expose illegal fox hunting in the UK. In 2014, Will Potter proposed using UAVs to monitor conditions on factory farms. The idea is to circumvent ag-gag prohibitions by keeping the UAVs on public property, but equipping them with cameras sensitive enough to monitor distant activities. Potter raised nearly $23,000 in 2 days for this project on Kickstarter. Healthcare A 2018 review identified three roles for UAVs in healthcare: * Prehospital emergency care; * Speeding up laboratory testing; * Surveillance. While other uses are being researched, such as their use for larval source management (LSM) to control vectors of diseases like malaria. Filmmaking Use of UAV for documentary filmmaking in Togo For commercial UAV camerawork inside the United States, industry sources state that usage relies on the de facto consent ‚Äì or benign neglect ‚Äì of local law enforcement. Use of UAVs for filmmaking is generally easier on large private lots or in rural and exurban areas with fewer space constraints. In localities such as Los Angeles and New York, authorities have actively interceded to shut down UAV filmmaking over safety or terrorism concerns. In June 2014, the FAA acknowledged that it had received a petition from the Motion Picture Association of America seeking approval for the use of UAVs for aerial photography. Seven companies behind the petition argued that low-cost UAVs could be used for shots that would otherwise require a helicopter or a manned aircraft, saving money and reducing risk for pilot and crew. UAVs are already used by media in other parts of the world. UAVs have been used to film sporting events, such as the 2014 Winter Olympics, as they have greater freedom of movement than cable-mounted cameras.  Hobby and recreational use  Model aircraft (small UAS) have been flown by hobbyists since the earliest days of manned flight. In the United States, hobby and recreational use of such UAS is permitted (a) strictly for hobby or recreational use; (b) when operated in accordance with a community- based set of safety guidelines and nationwide community-based organizations; (c) when limited to not more than 55 pounds (with exceptions); (d)without interfering with and giving way to any manned aircraft; and (e) within 5 miles of an airport only after notifying air traffic control. The Academy of Model Aeronautics is a community based organization that maintains operational safety guidelines with a long proven history of effectiveness and safety. Recreational uses of UAVs include: * Filming and photographing recreational activity * Drone racing, generally in the form where participants control radio-controlled UAVs equipped with cameras, while wearing head-mounted displays showing the live stream camera feed from the drones. * Being pulled by a UAV in combination with some sports equipment, such as a snowboard (\\"droneboarding\\"), or wakeboard (\\"drone surfing\\"). However, these activities generally require rather large (and hence rather expensive) UAVs. Journalism Journalists are interested in using UAVs for newsgathering. The College of Journalism and Mass Communications at University of Nebraska- Lincoln established the Drone Journalism Lab. University of Missouri created the Missouri Drone Journalism Program. The Professional Society of Drone Journalists was established in 2011. UAVs have covered disasters such as typhoons. A coalition of 11 news organizations is working with the Mid- Atlantic Aviation Partnership at Virginia Tech on how reporters could use unmanned aircraft to gather news. Law enforcement Many police departments in India have procured UAVs for law and order and aerial surveillance. UAVs have been used for domestic police work in Canada and the United States. A dozen US police forces had applied for UAV permits by March 2013.Horgen, John (March 2013) Unmanned Flight National Geographic, Retrieved 20 February 2013 UAVs have been used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection since 2005. with plans to use armed UAVs. The FBI stated in 2013 that they use UAVs for \\"surveillance\\".

Approximately 167 police and fire departments bought unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States in 2016, double the number that were purchased in 2015. A UAV in Goma as part of MONUSCO peacekeeping mission In August 2013, the Italian defence company Selex ES provided an unarmed surveillance UAV to the Democratic Republic of Congo to monitor movements of armed groups in the region and to protect the civilian population more effectively. Dutch train networks use tiny UAVs to look out for graffiti as an alternative to CCTV cameras. Scientific research AAI Corporation Aerosonde UAVs are especially useful in accessing areas that are too dangerous for manned aircraft. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration began using the Aerosonde unmanned aircraft system in 2006 as a hurricane hunter. The 35-pound system can fly into a hurricane and communicate near-real-time data directly to the National Hurricane Center. Beyond the standard barometric pressure and temperature data typically culled from manned hurricane hunters, the Aerosonde system provides measurements from closer to the water's surface than before. NASA later began using the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk for hurricane measurements. Search and rescue Aeryon Scout in flight UAVs were used in search and rescue after hurricanes struck Louisiana and Texas in 2008. Predators, operating between 18,000 and 29,000 feet, performed search and rescue and damage assessment. Payloads were an optical sensor and a synthetic aperture radar. The latter can penetrate clouds, rain or fog and in daytime or nighttime conditions, all in real time. Photos taken before and after the storm are compared and a computer highlights damage areas. Micro UAVs, such as the Aeryon Scout, have been used to perform search and rescue activities on a smaller scale, such as the search for missing persons. In 2014, a UAV helped locate an 82-year-old man who had been missing for three days. The UAV searched a 200-acre field and located the man in 20 minutes. In March 2017, DJI released a study of lives saved by the use of drones stating at least 59 lives have been saved by civilian drones in 18 different incidents. UAVs have been tested as airborne lifeguards, locating distressed swimmers using thermal cameras and dropping life preservers to swimmers. In January 2018, the lives of two teenage boys were saved by a drone in New South Wales, Australia. They were struggling in heavy waters around 700 meters away from the shoreline. Lifesavers, while still in training to use the drone system, immediately dispatched the drone to the site, where it dropped the inflatable rescue pod. Surveillance Aerial surveillance of large areas is possible with low-cost UAS. Surveillance applications include livestock monitoring, wildfire mapping, pipeline security, home security, road patrol and antipiracy. UAVs in commercial aerial surveillance (like the Applied Aeronautics Albatross UAV) is expanding with the advent of automated object detection. Inspections UAVs are increasingly finding applications in infrastructure inspections. They are particularly useful for inspections that are dangerous for human surveyors like roof inspections, power line inspections, wind turbine inspections, mining inspections or inspections inside power-plants. UAVs carrying thermal cameras are frequently used for solar panel or building inspections. Surveying Unmanned aerial photogrammetric survey: UAS technologies are used worldwide, often for aerial photogrammetry or with LiDAR sensors.Drone Surveying =Pollution monitoring= UAVs equipped with air quality monitors provide real time air analysis at various elevations. =Oil, gas and mineral exploration and production= CSIRO guidance system used to inspect power lines (2009) UAVs can be used to perform geophysical surveys, in particular geomagnetic surveys where measurements of the Earth's varying magnetic field strength are used to calculate the nature of the underlying magnetic rock structure. A knowledge of the underlying rock structure helps to predict the location of mineral deposits. Oil and gas production entails the monitoring of the integrity of oil and gas pipelines and related installations. For above-ground pipelines, this monitoring activity can be performed using digital cameras mounted on UAVs. In 2012, Cavim, the state-run arms manufacturer of Venezuela, claimed to be producing its own UAV as part of a system to survey and monitor pipelines, dams and other rural infrastructure.(14 June 2012) Chavez unveils surveillance drone BBC News Latin America & Caribbean, Retrieved 8 April 2013(14 June 2012) Chavez shows off first Venezuelan drone Dawn.com, Retrieved 6 April 2013 =Disaster relief= UAVs can help in disaster relief by providing intelligence across an affected area. For example, two George Mason University students are aiming to design a device that uses soundwaves to extinguish fire.

Agriculture A Yamaha R-MAX, a UAV that has been used for aerial application in Japan Japanese farmers have been using Yamaha's R-50 and RMAX unmanned helicopters to dust their crops since 1987.Ross, Philip E. (27 February 2014) Chris Anderson's Expanding Drone Empire IEEE Spectrum, Retrieved 8 March 2014(2014) Yamaha RMAX Type IG/Type II unmanned helicopter Yamaha Company website, Retrieved 8 March 2014 Some farming initiatives in the U.S. use UAVs for crop spraying, as they are often cheaper than a full-sized helicopter. UAV are also now becoming an invaluable tool by farmers in other aspect of farming, such as monitoring livestock, crops and water levels. NDVI images, generated with a near-IR sensor, can provide detailed information on crop health, improving yield and reducing input cost. Sophisticated UAV have also been used to create 3D images of the landscape to plan for future expansions and upgrading. Krossblade SkyProwler transformer UAV for research into vertical take-off and landing technologies for aircraft Manufacturing Drones can be used for the additive manufacturing of structures in a singular sense or under the breadth of swarm 3D printing. This is particularly useful for the production of large structures and components, where traditional 3D printing is not able to be utilized due to hardware size constraints. The challenges in this field include a very high demand for energy efficiency and stabilization of manufacturing hardware against the overarching aerial vehicle. Research in aerial manufacturing is in its early stages, however has been pursued by names such as IBM and Rosotics, the latter being the first to demonstrate swarm 3D printing using a metallic payload, and the only to achieve metallic additive manufacturing from an airborne platform. UAVs provide an alternative to traditional manufacturing systems and methodologies, since while under autonomous flight, a drone faces virtually no barrier to effective build volume, otherwise known as manufacturing scale invariance. In June 2020, the advent of the Rapid Induction Printing metal additive manufacturing process had accelerated the field of aerial manufacturing by providing a safer and more energy efficient means to produce structures, allowing for lightweight onboard power systems consistent with the drone industry to support manufacturing applications.  Construction  At least one drone has demonstrated the feasibility of painting a wall with spray cans.First in the World Graffiti Drone (Part 1) Carlo Paneni, of Ausco Modular, has conducted a preliminary proof of concept of a drone in the construction of modular buildings (Australian patent application no. 2019902083) . In modular, most of the building is constructed in separate modules in the safe and controlled environment of a factory. Yet, after the modules are delivered on site, the gaps between such modules need to be covered: for an operation that is relative minimal, extensive protections need to be established for a worker to safely complete this task at heights. This relatively small task with high impost in terms of safety if done manually, is perfectly suited for a drone. Developed with the collaboration of Freelance Robotics, a proof of concept was conducted in Ausco Modular‚Äôs hire yard in Brisbane, Australia. In construction, drones can be used to survey building sites to help monitor and report progress, spot errors early on and avoid rework and show off finished projects in marketing materials. In China, drones may fly over a building site to monitor progress made during the day. Until 2016 this was not allowed under United States FAA regulation. US government has since passed CFR 14 Part 107 regulation which allows drone pilots to become licensed by the FAA for small UAS operation, and use drones for commercial purposes such as construction progress monitoring and site surveying. Errors in construction can be costly in terms of money and time to resolve, so detecting these errors can result in large savings. Drones may also be used in construction to measure raw materials as inputs to building construction. Aerial photographs can be used to create 3D models and 2D orthomosaic maps of buildings. Construction sites are generally high hazard environments and thus workers are already protected by hardhats and other safety precautions, which makes introduction of drones safer, however, UAS pilots are still advised to implement safety and alerting procedures and checklists. The construction companies can attempt to implement all aspects of a drone program themselves, or outsource all or parts of it to a drone services provider. Since the easing of FAA restrictions on commercial drones, there has been an increase of aerial services providers in the US and worldwide.

Background Ragged Old Flag was written in 1974 while Cash was in Binghamton, New York, during a time of political turbulence in the United States that had forced the resignation of President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Although Cash had publicly supported Nixon's candidacy, he had started to question the wisdom of Nixon- era policies concerning the Vietnam War. He wrote \\"Ragged Old Flag\\" to \\"reaffirm faith in the country and the goodness of the American people.\\" The song tells a story of an old man in a town square describing what the flag and country have been through together. Ragged Old Flag is typical of Cash's particular style of patriotism characterized by his appreciation for the land, people and complexities of the United States. Critical Acclaim Although some considered the song too jingoistic and sentimental, it was largely popular with Cash's audience. Despite its popularity during live performances, its success was short-lived and the song only reached number 31 on country music charts. It has been contrasted to country songs that espoused a more black and white view of patriotism such as Merle Haggard's \\"Okie From Muskogee\\" and \\"The Fightin' Side of Me\\".. The song's popularity has increased after the September 11 attacks. Frye Gaillard has described the song as a \\"poignant pledge of allegiance\\". The Sunday Herald has described it as \\"a defiant tribute to the stars and stripes\\". It has also been described as an \\"anti-flag burning\\" song. Live performances At the first Americana Music Awards in September 2002, Cash added references to Operation Desert Storm and Afghanistan. During live performances, Cash usually introduced the song with the following: > \\"I thank God for all the freedom we have in this country, I cherish them and > treasure them - even the right to burn the flag. We also got the right to > bear arms and if you burn my flag - I'll shoot you.\\" \\"Ragged Old Flag\\" is recited at events around the country. It has been played by the West Point Band, and recited by various veterans groups at events on Veterans Day and the 4th of July.

It consists of four films: A Thief in the Night (1972), A Distant Thunder (1978), Image of the Beast (1981), and The Prodigal Planet (1983). The series focuses on the difficulties of those who miss out on the Rapture by having not trusted Christ as savior and thus find themselves in the Tribulation. Interspersed throughout the four films are many presentations of the Christian gospel.Dean A. Anderson, The original \\"Left Behind\\", Christianity Today, Published March 7, 2012, Retrieved December 9, 2017.  Plot  Patty Myers is a young woman who considers herself a Christian because she occasionally reads her Bible and goes to church regularly, where the pastor is really an unbeliever. She refuses to believe the warnings of her friends and family that she will go through the Tribulation if she does not accept Jesus as her savior. One morning, she awakens to find that her husband and millions of others have suddenly disappeared. Gradually, Patty realizes that the Rapture has happened. The United Nations establishes an emergency government system called the United Nations Imperium of Total Emergency (UNITE), and those who do not receive the Mark identifying them with UNITE will be arrested. Patty is conflicted and refuses to trust Christ as her savior but also refuses to take the Mark. She desperately tries to avoid the law and the Mark but is captured by UNITE. She escapes but is cornered by UNITE on top of a dam and falls to her death. Patty then awakens, this time for real, and realizes that all she had experienced was only a dream. Her relief is short-lived when the radio announces that millions of people have disappeared. Horrified, Patty frantically searches for her husband only to find him missing too. Traumatized and distraught, Patty realizes that the Rapture has indeed occurred and that she has been left behind. In A Distant Thunder, the story of Patty is told in a flashback, which itself includes flashbacks. It begins with Patty awaiting her execution and, after fellow Christians awaiting execution ask her how she got there, she begins to tell the story and a flashback commences. The flashback begins where the previous film left off, with Patty awakening from her dream to realize that the Rapture has actually occurred. The film ends dramatically with Patty witnessing her friend Wenda being executed and arguing with Wenda's younger sister Sandy (who, along with Jerry and Diane, urges Patty to take the Mark) who betrayed them‚Äîand being prepped for her own execution. The third film begins with Patty being forced by UNITE soldiers to decide to take the Mark or to be publicly executed by guillotine. The soldiers strap her, speechless and in shock, down to the guillotine, lying face-up. A sudden earthquake and storm appear, and the soldiers and others nearby run for safety, leaving Patty strapped to the guillotine. She cries, \\"I want the Mark!\\", yet no one was nearby to hear her or unstrap her. Alone, she attempts to unstrap herself, but the guillotine blade falls on its own, and Patty dies. The film then turns to a new story, that of Dave, Leslie, and Connie. Leslie is with Patty at the guillotine, waiting her turn, when she escapes due to the eschatological earthquake. She runs, goes down into an underground room and meets Dave there, who she then falls in love with. Dave's purpose seems to be to develop a counterfeit Mark so that a person can buy and sell without using the actual Beast's Mark and to destroy the master computer of the Beast by injecting into it a destructive code, which in fact is the song, \\"Onward Christian Soldiers.\\" The story is presented with action scenes and interspersed long conversations. Connie is an agent of the Beast who pretends to cooperate with Dave.These paragraphs are supported by the primary sources, the four movies, readily available to all. The fourth film involves life after a nuclear war, where mutants roam the Earth. A fifth installment, The Battle of Armageddon, was planned but never finished.  Filming  Filming for A Thief in the Night and A Distant Thunder was largely done in and around Des Moines, Iowa and surrounding areas. The rapture scene in A Thief in the Night (the missing letters from the marquee) were filmed at the First Church of the Open Bible, which is located at the corner of Hickman Road and Beaver Ave in Des Moines. The climatic ending scene was filmed at the Red Rock Dam, which is located southeast of Des Moines. The UNITE center, along with the guillotine scenes, shown in A Distant Thunder, were filmed at the Providence Reformed Church and the Redeemer Lutheran Church, both located at the corner of University Ave. and 37th St. in Des Moines.  Music  This film includes Larry Norman's composition \\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready\\", one of the earliest Christian rock hits and one of Norman's best-known releases.  Legacy  A Thief in the Night has been seen by an estimated 300 million people worldwide. It was a pioneer in the genre of Christian film, bringing rock music and elements of horror film to a genre then dominated by family-friendly evangelism. A quarter century later, the authors of the broadly successful Left Behind series of books and films acknowledged their debt to Thief. Indeed, even the title Left Behind echoes the refrain of Norman's theme song for A Thief in the Night, \\"I Wish We'd All Been Ready,\\" in which he sings, \\"There's no time to change your mind, the son has come and you've been left behind.\\"  References  Films about Evangelicalism American films Apocalyptic films Films produced by Russell S.

It has a single tubular leaf and up to thirty greenish-brown to purplish flowers. Further studies of the species may indicate that some collections currently included may be of a different species. Description Prasophyllum parviflorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and wide. Between ten and thirty flowers are widely spaced along flowering stem long which reaches to a height of . The flowers are greenish- brown to purplish and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The ovary is oval-shaped and about long. The dorsal sepal is a tapering egg shape, about long and wide. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped, curved, about long, wide and fused at their bases. The petals are long, wide and curve forwards. The labellum is variably coloured, about long, wide and sharply upwards near its middle. There is a broad, fleshy, glossy callus along the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November. Taxonomy and naming The slender leek orchid was first formally described in 1930 by Richard Sanders Rogers who gave it the name Prasophyllum hartii var. parviflorum and published the description in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia from a specimen collected on Wilsons Promontory. In 1941, William Henry Nicholls raised the variety to species status. Distribution and habitat Prasophyllum parviflorum grows in grassland and grassy areas in woodland east from French Island to the New South Wales border. Specimens collected in the west of the state may be P. suaveolens and small plants may, with further studies, be shown to be a separate species.

In other major matches, Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeated Mr. Gannosuke in a match, which stipulated that Gannosuke must retire if he lost and Kintaro Kanemura successfully defended the WEW Hardcore Championship against Masato Tanaka. Reception Stuart of Puroresu Central gave negative reviews to the event, with \\"It turned into a good show after the awful match with XPW scrubs involved, but the sheer quantity of junk before that really damages the show as a whole. Looking past that stuff, the good part not only had the better wrestler, but maybe coincidentally, maybe not, had better booked angles than some of the bush league crap on the undercard. GOEMON vs. Onryo is goofy in theory, but I dug the uniqueness of it. Gannosuke vs. Kuroda was one mans fight to save FMW from the evil of show puroresu (sports-entertainment), although he failed and got retired (for now). Kanemura vs. Tanaka had no real storyline in the modern FMW sense that I picked up on, it was just a war between two old rivals, who turned the clock back a few years and left the current era for just under 18 minutes. And the main event concluded, for now, the ongoing saga between Hayabusa and Fuyuki, with Fuyuki hinting at a full babyface turn at the end, especially with Kuroda turning heel.

AMA interviewees have ranged from various celebrities to everyday people in several lines of work. Founded in May 2009, the subreddit has gone on to become one of Reddit's most popular communities.  Concept  IAmA is based around posting \\"AMAs\\" (for \\"Ask Me Anything\\"), or similarly \\"AMAAs\\" (Ask Me Almost/Absolutely Anything) ‚Äì prompts for others to ask questions about any topic. AMAs are open to all Reddit users, but interviewees require proof that they are who/what they claim to be. They use the site's comment system for both questions and answers; this process has been equated to an online press conference. Like the rest of Reddit, users can also upvote and downvote potential candidates - with the most favoured being more likely to receive an answer. = History = According to The Atlantic, this concept is new to the digital age. They deemed the closest equivalents to be game shows, and radio call-in shows, which placed a heavy focus on the interviewees. Contrastingly, r/IAmA places more emphasis on users answering the questions. The concept's genesis on the internet began in the 1990s; Slashdot launched similar interviews in 1999, but only 10 questions per person were allowed. Participants included free software advocate Bruce Perens and Linux developer Alan Cox. This was followed by Something Awful's Ask/Tell forums, which was more focused on interviews with everyday people. Reddit built on this idea with video interviews with site staff Alexis Ohanian and Erik Martin. The following demand for AMAs led to the creation of the current r/IAmA subreddit in May 2009. Unlike its precursors, it requires proof of identity. Since its founding, similar features have appeared in other social media sites, like Tumblr and Ask.fm.  Participants  Initially, AMAs focused more on ordinary citizens; these interviews still make up some of the subreddit's content today. As Reddit expanded, its staff attempted to bring in celebrity guests‚Äîearly examples include businesswoman Caterina Fake. Since then, a number of individuals have been interviewed in the IAmA subreddit, some of whom have appeared multiple times. Notable participants include then- United States President Barack Obama (while campaigning for the 2012 election), Bill Gates (multiple times), Bernie Sanders (amidst the 2018 midterm elections), and Holocaust survivor Alex Hershaft. Other people, including Donald Trump, have conducted AMAs in a similar fashion on other parts of Reddit. The increased traffic for Obama's AMA brought down many parts of the website when it occurred on August 29, 2012. Celebrities participating in AMAs have seen both positive and negative responses. In 2012, Woody Harrelson's AMA was criticized after Harrelson declined to answer questions that were unrelated to the movie he was then promoting. By contrast, rapper Snoop Dogg's 2012 AMA attracted 1.6 million page views after he provided several candid responses to the community's questions.  Controversies  From 2013 to 2015, Victoria Taylor assisted reddit's volunteer community in presenting interviews. She primarily transcribed spoken celebrity responses, but also helped organize timing, affirmed best practices, and assisted in preparation. On July 2, 2015, hundreds of subreddits, including several with over a million subscribers, were set to private by their respective volunteer moderators after Taylor was dismissed. These moderators stated that a primary factor for the shutdown was a lack of warning for Reddit's decision; Reddit provided no immediate replacement for Taylor's services. Sources closer to Reddit users cited an increased focus on commercializing AMAs as the most likely reason.

The regimental headquarters was destroyed during the Siege of Budapest in early 1945; the survivors were in Soviet prisoner of war camps by 11 February, but its battalions appear to have survived the siege.

ECAs utilize the material properties and expected stress history to determine a flaw acceptance criteria which will ensure that welds will not fail during the construction or service life of the welded structure. The assessment can be used before the structure is in use, or during in-service inspection, to determine whether a given weld is in need of repair. ECAs are used throughout the energy, manufacturing, and infrastructure industries. ECAs are based heavily upon fracture mechanics principles, and reflect an improvement over traditional methods of weld quality assurance, which can be arbitrary or overly conservative.  Background  During welding, defects or flaws can develop. In some cases, these flaws could potentially affect the integrity of the weld, resulting in failure by fatigue, creep, brittle fracture, or yielding. Therefore, codes to determine weld quality must be developed. Traditionally, welding codes have been based on workmanship criteria.API Standard 1104: \\"Welding of Pipelines and Related Facilities\\" (2007)CSA Z662-11: \\"Oil and gas pipeline systems\\" (2012).BS 7910: \\"Guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures\\" (2019).API Standard 579: \\"Fitness-for-Service\\" (2016) These criteria are determined empirically, typically by estimating the level of weld quality expected from a skilled welder. While these criteria have been reliable historically, improvements made in welding technology and materials science are not taken into account. As a result, over time, workmanship criteria have become increasingly conservative. This conservatism results in unnecessary repairs, which can increase construction costs and can yield undesirable residual stresses at the location of the repair weld. Beginning in the late 1970s to early 1980s, engineering critical assessments began to emerge as an alternative to traditional workmanship criteria. These ECAs relied heavily on recent developments in the field of fracture mechanics. Where workmanship criteria were developed with a limited understanding of material characteristics, and considered only the length of a given weld flaw, these ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria considered additional factors such as: * The stress history of the weld, including all cyclic and static stresses expected throughout the life cycle of the welded structure * The strength of the base metal and weld material * The fracture toughness (measured via Crack tip opening displacement testing or Charpy impact testing) of the base metal and the weld material * The flaw orientation (e.g., measurement of flaw length and flaw height, as opposed to flaw length only) Together, these additional factors allow for more generous flaw acceptance criteria, resulting in fewer unnecessarily repaired welds. To comply with the flaw acceptance criteria developed during ECA, non-destructive examination must be utilized. Ultrasonic testing is typically used due to its high accuracy, ability to identify flaw size and orientation, and its ability to provide feedback instantly.  ECA for oil and gas pipelines  ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, particularly with regard to qualification of girth welds on cross-country oil and gas transmission pipelines. This is because girth welds are typically uniform from weld to weld, allowing construction contractors to utilize mechanized welding. Mechanized welding increases productivity over manual welding techniques by allowing for better, more uniform control over weld characteristics. ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria are able to take advantage of the high strength and toughness of the welds produced to develop more generous flaw acceptance criteria. In addition, the flaws created during mechanized welding are typically oriented differently than flaws developed from manual welding. ECA-based flaw acceptance criteria more effectively assess these flaws, by considering flaw orientation, rather than just flaw length. = Standards = Several standards specific to ECAs for oil and gas pipelines have been developed. The most commonly used of these are API 1104 Appendix A, API 579, CSA Z662 Annex K, and BS 7910. The standard used depends primarily on the location of the pipeline being installed. The standards differ in methodology and in extreme cases, can result in significantly different flaw acceptance criteria. However, for typical operating conditions, the criteria are easy enough to follow that practical differences between the standards are small.

By modern standards, it would be considered a theatre ballistic missile (TBM) defense system (TBMD), providing protection to the Army field units from Warsaw Bloc short and medium-range weapons. The Army had first considered anti-ballistic missiles as early as 1946, in order to protect against attack by V-2 missiles and similar weapons. This work, Project Thumper and Project Wizard, was handed off to the US Air Force when that command was created in 1948. Delays and changes of mission for Wizard led to the Army re-considering their own needs, and started the Plato study in 1952. Sylvania won a development contract in 1956, and the proposed missile was assigned the designation SAM-A-19. When rapid deployment of theatre weapons during the late 1950s placed the Army at risk, Plato was still nowhere near ready for deployment. Plato was canceled in February 1959 in favor of modifications to the Hawk and Hercules anti-aircraft missiles to provide some level of protection while a much more capable system, FABMDS, was developed. FABMDS was in turn canceled due to mobility concerns, and replaced by SAM-D, today's Patriot. History =Early work= As part of a sweeping review of post-war requirements, on 20 June 1945 the Army Ground Forces Equipment review listed the requirement for \\"High velocity guided missiles‚Ä¶ capable of‚Ä¶ destroying missiles of the V-2 type, should be developed at the earliest practicable date.\\" In July of that year, the US Army Signal Corps started basic research into two radar systems for ABM use. In January 1946 the Commanding General of the Army Ground Forces (AGF) established a requirement for a study program on the V-2 problem. In early February, the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, the \\"Stillwell Board\\" run by Joseph Stilwell, restated the antimissile requirement in its report on a Proposed National Program for Guided Missiles. By 1 April Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson had signed off on the program, and at the end of May the Stilwell Board published a requirement for an antimissile with a 100,000 yard range. In March 1946 the Air Forces started Project Thumper (also known as MX-795) to consider the problem of defending against ballistic missiles like the V-2, using the \\"collision intercept\\" method. General Electric won the contract for Thumper, which is the first known ABM effort. Thumper was followed in April by a similar contract awarded to the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (MARC) under the name Project Wizard (MX-794). A funding crisis in 1947 caused both projects to see reduced interest, and in the summer they were turned into long-term studies, with General Electric receiving $500,000 a year and the MARC $1,000,000 a year. The Army Air Force and Ordnance Department had earlier split up programs based on whether they were \\"airplane like\\" or \\"rocket like\\", but Thumper and Wizard broke this rule and were developed under the AAF. Both projects moved to the Air Force when that force was created out of the Army Air Force in 1948. The Air Force cancelled Thumper in 1949, citing the overlap with the more advanced Wizard, and re-directed remaining funds to their GAPA anti-aircraft project. Wizard continued largely as a technology study with no actual hardware development. =Project Plato= Throughout this period the Army remained concerned about ballistic missile attack, as well as the need for some form of defensive system. In an 8 February 1950 memo to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army admitted that \\"the was no guided missile or other device in sight for protection against enemy supersonic guided missiles\\" and that the problem was \\"the extreme technical difficult in meeting or overtaking a missile travelling at supersonic speed.\\". In light of this, an existing Signal Corp radar project and other development was defunded. The Army continued to press for such a system and launched numerous research projects to develop working solutions. In addition to the radar work at the Signal Corps, in 1950 they started a study to see if the Bomarc missile might fill the role. Initial specifications for a mobile \\"Anti-Missile Missile\\" system for defense against ballistic missile attack were defined in 1951;Parsch 2003a This was followed by a September 1952 contract with the Aerophysics Development Corporation of Curtiss-Wright to study the overall system, and a November 1952 contract with the Signal Corps to once again consider the radar problem. On 20 October 1952 when an Army G-4 meeting reiterated the need for such a system and initiated Project Plato to coordinate the various studies.USACMH 1975, p. 117. When the Aerophysics report was returned on 15 May 1953 it gave them further impetus to research the radar systems, considered to the real problem, and sent out another contract to Bendix Aircraft in June 1953 to consider this. Their report returned in 1955 with the conclusion that the radar was possible. Studies by Sylvania Electric Products in 1953 and the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in 1954 led to the conclusion, in May 1956, that such a project was feasible; Sylvania's design for the XSAM-A-19 missile was selected for development in September 1956. The XSAM-A-19 was expected to reach speeds of up to Mach 8; the issues with hypersonic control and thermodynamics were a major part of the project studies. The project was partially announced to the public in February 1958, with it being announced that \\"Plato\\" was a mobile system that would use the Nike Zeus missile; in February 1959, before construction had begun on the prototype SAM-A-19 missiles, the project was canceled; the Nike Hercules surface-to-air missile would be adopted as an interim ABM. , the official histories of Project Plato were still classified. =Cancellation= As the Plato missile was designed to fly at speeds of Mach 6 to 8, a relatively unknown area, most of the Plato work after 1956 was concerned with aerodynamic and thermodynamic studies. Plato studies continued until February 1959, when very little progress had been made. Reports early that year demonstrated a rapid buildup of short- and medium-range missiles and rockets in the Warsaw Pact forces. Although first identified as a threat over a decade earlier, it took considerable time for the expected problem to actually evolve. In spite of this long delay the Army was nowhere near ready to deploy the Plato system. In something of a panic, the Army canceled Plato in favor of upgrades to the existing Hawk and Hercules missiles. This would be a stop-gap measure only, a true solution to the TBM problem was still needed. FABMDS General Electric FABMDS Despite the cancellation of Plato, the requirement for a definitive ABM system remained, and the Army started the Field Army Ballistic Missile Defense System project in September 1959.Parsch 2003b Studies of FABMDS were run through May 1960, and proposals for the project, which was defined as being fully mobile and capable of undertaking four simultaneous intercept with a 95% probability of kill (PK); in September 1961, General Electric's submission was judged the best of the proposals. The proposed FABMDS was a large, solid- fueled missile, capable of intercepting theatre and medium-range ballistic missiles; in length with a diameter of , it was to be equipped with a nuclear warhead and could intercept incoming missiles at altitudes of up to . By October 1962, however, the technology available was officially deemed incapable of producing a cost-effective system; in addition, the requirement had been altered to require capability for defense against aircraft, which was considered compromising to the effectiveness of the system against missile targets,Davis 1986, p.3. and the FABMDS program was canceled. It was replaced by the Army Air Defense for the 1970s (AADS-70) program, which became Surface- to-Air Missile-Development (SAM-D) and eventually produced the MIM-104 Patriot missile system.Delaney 2015, p.64.

John Rock (August 19, 1836 (1838)-August 9, 1904) was a German-born American horticulturalist and nurseryman. John Rock was a leader in California in pomology and the nursery business from 1865 until his death in 1904. Charles Howard Shinn wrote the biography for John Rock in L.H. Bailey's Cyclopedia of Horticulture He said \\"John Rock's scientific spirit, his wide and ever-increasing knowledge, his very high standards of business and his unselfishness made him during his long life the leader of Pacific coast nurserymen. He introduced more valuable plants and varieties to American horticulture than any other man of his period. His connection with Japan, India, Australia and with the great establishments abroad was close and constant. He did much to encourage men like Luther Burbank, and his collections were always at the service of students and the public.\\"  Germany  John Rock was born in Germany - Lauter, Hesse, or Hesse-Darmstadt.Passport No. 2182, issued July 12, 1889 for travel to Heidelberg, Germany from July to October 1889. Johann Fels may have been his birth name and he changed his name to John Rock when he came to the United States. Another source says that his parents were named Roch.  New York  John Rock immigrated to the United States when he was 15. For a time he worked for various florists and nurseries, including Ellwanger & Barry in Rochester, New York. His passport in 1889 indicates that he immigrated to the United States aboard the William Tapscott from Liverpool in June 1857 and arrived in New York August 19, 1857.  Civil War  John Rock enlisted in the 5th Regiment, New York Infantry on April 25, 1861, (or April 11, 1861) also known as Duryee's Zouaves. He served for two years and mustered out on May 14, 1863.  San Jose  After his discharge, John Rock headed to California by way of Panama. He arrived in San Francisco on June 19, 1863. He settled in the Santa Clara Valley and may have first worked with James Lick. Rock was naturalized as an American citizen in 1864 in San Jose, California.  Rock's Nurseries in San Jose  John Rock established his \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" along Coyote Creek in 1865. The first nursery was 48 acres on the Milpitas road. The nursery can be seen on Map 2 of the 1876 Thompson & West map. His neighbor was pioneer nurseryman, B.S. Fox. Around 1880, Rock moved to a location with 138 acres near Wayne Station on the Western Pacific line. This nursery can be seen on \\"Part of Berryessa & Milpitas Districts Compiled for the Santa Clara Valley\\" in the Brainard Agricultural Atlas Rock continued to sell nursery stock through his \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" (at least until 1888) even after the California Nursery Company in Niles was established. The San Jose City Directory for 1887 has advertisements for both \\"Rock's Nurseries\\" and for the California Nursery Company. He sold \\"Fruit & Ornamental Trees, Shrubs, Roses, Flowering Plants, Etc.\\"  The California Nursery Company  Article on \\"The Nursery Business\\" features scenes from the California Nursery Company The California Nursery Company was established and incorporated in 1884 in the town of Niles (now a district of Fremont, California). The 1886-87 descriptive catalog lists the officers. John Rock was President and R. D. Fox was Vice-president; The directors were John Rock, James Hutchison, R. D. Fox, Thos. Meherin, Wm. J. Landers. John Rock was the manager of the nursery. The California Nursery Company grew roses, ornamental trees and shrubs, and fruit and nut trees. = Fruit and Nut Trees = The 1902 catalog describes the fruits and nuts that were grown in the nursery's specimen orchard shortly before Rock's death. George C. Roeding bought the California Nursery Company 13 years after the death of John Rock in 1917. With this purchase, he gained a significant \\"test orchard\\" of fruit and nut trees. Roeding wrote about John Rock's \\"Mother Orchard\\" and his own specimen trees from his Fancher Creek nurseries in a 1926 publication, \\"Budwood, scions and cuttings : (embracing over 1000 varieties) from record performance fruit trees\\" Rock's specimen orchard book from the late 1800s describes fruit varieties and where they were obtained. = Figs = John Rock had the largest collection of figs on the Pacific Coast as reported by Gustav Eisen in 1901. The figs came from Thomas Rivers & Son, from France, from the USDA (which had obtained the whole collection of the Royal Horticultural Society of London), and from local nurserymen. = Catalogs = Catalogs for the California Nursery Company can be found in these collections: * Henry G. Gilbert Nursery and Seed Trade Catalog Collection for USDA * Mertz Digital Collections, New York Botanical Garden * The Biodiversity Heritage Library * The Internet Archive hosts many of these collections and has an Open Library interface.  Death  G.A.R. star. John Rock died in 1904. The 1904-1905 catalog announces his death: \\"Our beloved Manager has passed into the Great Unknown. A familiar name and figure has gone-- a man and friend of sterling qualities is no more; one in whose judgement and abilities vast numbers of people and even governments have securely rested in horticultural matters can advise no longer. We mourn his loss\\". Rock is buried about 3 miles north of the California Nursery Company at the Chapel of the Chimes. John Rock was remembered by E.J. Wickson, at the 1911-1912 Pacific Coast Association of Nurserymen: \\"He has gone to his reward, but his memory will always be honored by every nurseryman who ever knew him ‚Äî Mr. John Rock, who began in this community in a small way and built up the nursery business and finally extended his interests into large commercial enterprises which I hope we shall visit while here. Mr. Rock has always stood to me as an example of what a nurseryman ought to be in his position as an educator to the community, because he possessed at the time when he was most active and energetic, a fuller and truer knowledge of the nursery business than any other man in California. He was a good student and possessed himself of all sources of information; he was a wonderful observer, and had a keen eye for a fruit or for a plant and, above all, had a sterling honesty and conscientiousness which led everyone who knew him to place implicit confidence in any statement which he might make, and you could trust Rock to give you facts, although it might not be immediately to his interest to do so. John Rock gave me a palm in 1879, a little palm in a pot, and I planted it in my garden in Berkeley, and that palm is today the handsomest and largest palm in the City of Berkeley ‚Äî it must be 40 feet high and 30 feet across its branches. I see it every day that I am at home and never pass it without thinking that that palm stands as a monument to the life and service of John Rock in its community. It is stalwart, symmetrical and beautiful and sheds its beauty among all its environments; so Rock stood among the pioneer fruit growers and the more we know of his life and deeds the better we will be able to understand the possibilities of a nurseryman in the community.\\" Henry W. Kruckeberg wrote \\"John Rock: a Tribute\\" in the proceedings of the 1912 California Association of Nurserymen. He did not know Rock personally but collected the remembrances from his living friends. \\"In more ways than one, the name of John Rock is destined to become historic in California horticultural development. He had, in a marked degree, the mind and temperament calculated to stimulate fruit growing along sane and intelligent lines. Value was ever uppermost in his mind; no fruit, tree or plant commended itself to him unless it possessed utility or beauty, or both. So pronounced was he in this respect, that he never adopted a new fruit without first testing it out on his experiment grounds. Intensely in love with his work, it is no wonder that he spent thousands of dollars in exploiting new and little known fruits and plants, many of which proved worthless; nor that, on the other hand, his untiring zeal in the development of California horticulture has been the direct means of introducing a larger number of varieties of fruits and plants into this State than any other one man. His well known continuity of purpose was as pronounced as his ambition was strong and robust. For upwards of forty years he was untiring in his efforts to stimulate, broaden and intensify the importance of California horticulture.\\"  California Nursery Historical Park  The California Nursery continued on under other owners until the 1970s. The last 20 acres of the 463-acre nursery are a park in the Niles District of Fremont, California.

Early life and career  Sadomba was born around 1940 in Southern Rhodesia. He attributed his political influence to some of his teachers in his youth. He was active in the youth wings of Zimbabwean African nationalist organizations. Before entering politics, Sadomba was a schoolteacher.  Political career  In the 1970 election, Sadomba was elected to the House of Assembly for the Nemakonde constituency. He was one of seven black members elected from the Centre Party, a moderate, multiracial party opposed to the discriminatory policies of the governing Rhodesian Front. At the time of his election, Sadomba was the youngest Member of Parliament. Sadomba believed that no tribal chiefs should be in the Senate and that political power should devolve only through the elected senators. In 1971, the issue of settlement proposals with the United Kingdom over Rhodesian independence became a point of discord within the Centre Party. The party's white leadership supported the Pearce Commission proposals, but the party's black members opposed it. Sadomba initially stayed in line with the party and supported the proposals, but changed his position after realizing he was an \\"obvious target\\" for blacks opposed to them. He resigned from the Centre Party in February 1972, explaining his reason by saying: \\"If by saying 'No' the African people are going to be united, then who am I go against this tide and cause the division which is responsible for our position today?\\" After leaving the Centre Party, he joined the newly-formed African National Council, at one point becoming the party's Deputy Secretary for External Affairs. In 1974, Sadomba was reelected to Parliament. In 1975, he left the ANC and became an independent. In 1977, he was elected to Parliament for the Harare constituency. By 1978, he was the leader of the black caucus in Parliament. In 1979, he joined the United African National Council, the party of Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. He was elected to Parliament for Mashonaland West Province in the 1979 Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election. However, in the 1980 election right before Zimbabwe's independence, Sadomba lost his reelection campaign. In 1981, Sadomba left the UANC and joined ZANU‚ÄìPF, the party of Robert Mugabe. In his letter of resignation from the party presented to Bishop Muzorewa (and a copy of which he gave to The Rhodesia Herald), he said that he could no longer continue to go against his conscience. He said it had been \\"a pleasure\\" working with UANC leadership but the time had come for him to leave. In 2000, Sadomba ran as the United Parties candidate for the Seke constituency, but lost with only 0.5% of the vote.  Personal life  Sadomba was described in 1971 as \\"a likeable man, a schoolteacher and a Methodist.\\"  Electoral history  1970 Rhodesian general election, Nemakonde constituency * Ronald Sadomba (CP) - 281 (44.3%) * Chad Magumise Chipunza (NPU) - 131 (20.6%) * Herbert Munukwa Mano (Ind) - 87 (13.7%) * Paul Harbinett Joseph Chanetsa (Ind) - 83 (13.1%) * Eric Gwanzura (Ind) - 45 (7.1%) * Simon Chibvawure Paraffin (RAP) - 8 (1.3%) 1974 Rhodesian general election, Nemakonde constituency * Ronald Sadomba (Ind ANC) - 273 (83.0%) * Stephen Amos Dzuka Chirenda (Ind) - 51 (15.5%) * Mulena Mwana Sherena Mundawarara (APP) - 5 (1.5%) '1977 Rhodesian general election', Harare constituency * Ronald Sadomba (Ind) - 147 (57.6%) * Tiriwanhu Mudzimu (Ind) - 83% (32.6%) * David Munyamana (Ind) - 15 (5.9%) * Milton Jack Makaya (Ind) - 10 (3.9%) 1979 Zimbabwe Rhodesia general election, Mashonaland West Province * Ronald Sadomba (UANC) - (1 of 6 elected from 24 candidates through proportional representation system) 1980 Southern Rhodesian general election, Mashonaland West Province * Ronald Sadomba (UANC) - (not elected; top 8 elected from 56 candidates through proportional representation system) 2000 Zimbabwean parliamentary election, Seke constituency * Tumbare Mutasa (MDC) - 10,821 (45.8%) * Phineas Chihota (ZANU‚ÄìPF) - 9,236 (39.1%) * Beta Zvanyanya Dongo (ZUD) - 2,047 (8.7%) * Peter Mashumba (Ind MDC) - 703 (3.0%) * Abraham Mombeshora (Ind MDC) - 388 (1.6%) * Gerald Mubaira (Ind) - 320 (1.4%) * Ronald Sadomba (UP) - 133 (0.5%)  References  1940 births Living people 20th-century Methodists 20th- century Zimbabwean politicians 20th-century Zimbabwean people 21st-century Zimbabwean people 21st-century Zimbabwean politicians Centre Party (Rhodesia) politicians Members of the National Assembly of Zimbabwe Members of the Parliament of Rhodesia People from Mashonaland West Province Rhodesian Methodists Rhodesian politicians United African National Council politicians United Parties politicians ZANU‚ÄìPF politicians Rhodesian schoolteachers Zimbabwean Methodists Zimbabwean political candidates ","title":"Ronnie Sadomba"},{"id":"56002848","text":"Ammer Polisa is an Indian Tulu-language comedy-drama filmhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tulu/movie- details/ammer-polisa/movieshow/62295948.cms directed by K.

Since the late 20th century, Swedish policy toward disabilities has been centered around the idea of equal opportunity and equal rights for all. National, regional, and local governments play a part in creating an equal society, giving those with disabilities the chance to be economically and socially stable. Currently, Sweden has a two tier disability pension program. The first tier is a universal disability pension program that allows anyone between the ages of 16 and 64 to receive disability pay if they are unable to do a quarter of what they could initially do. The second tier encompasses an earnings-related disability benefit that depends upon the contributions made by the workers and the level of disability.  Background  In the 19th and early 20th century, Sweden had little to no legislation protecting people with disabilities and openly treated them as second class citizens who didn't deserve to have equal opportunity. They would incarcerate people that were believed to have a disability, including children as young as seven years old to ensure that they wouldn't reproduce or contaminate society. This was Sweden's initial solution for dealing with people with disabilities. In the mid-20th century, this began to gradually change as Sweden started to pass legislation that supported people with disabilities living outside of institutions and they began to toy with the idea of other programs that would help people with disabilities. In recent years, they have taken great strides towards guaranteeing equal rights and opportunities to people that have disabilities through the implementation of government programs and legislation, regarding education, employment, housing, and transportation.  Government programs and legislation  Since the 1980s, drastic additions to government programs and legislation have closed the gap of inequality between people with disabilities and those that are full functioning members of society, giving people with disabilities the opportunity to have jobs, receive an education, and live in their own housing with help if necessary. In order to qualify for any sort of disability pay, a person has to be able to do 25% less than what they were initially able to do. To qualify for full disability pay, a person has to be able to do 84% less than what they were initially able to do. = Social Services Act = The Social Services Act implemented in 1982 and since changed many times covers a wide array of people in addition to persons with functional disabilities, including the elderly, children, crime victims, and people that have alcohol or drug addictions. It states that those who are under the age of 65 with a functional disability are able to request services such as a companion to help with errands, special housing options that would allow them to be cared for 24 hours a day, and home help services if they need assistance with personal care. = Cash sickness benefit = If a worker is ill and unable to work, they will receive full pay for up to 90 days. = Education Act = The Education Act guarantees that starting at the age of 6, all children will have equal access to education opportunities. It also insures that children who may need extra help in school, meaning children that have disabilities will receive it. = Housing grants = These allow people to request grants in order to modify their living space to make it more accessible with their disability. = Vocational rehabilitation = Vocational rehabilitation is automatically offered to every person with a disability, but in order to receive a referral to a rehabilitation facility, it has to be believed that you will be able to do at least half of what you could do before the disability. = Car subsidies = People who are unable to ride public transportation or have a difficult time can request subsidies that help them purchase a car so they are able to get around easier.  Employment  A significant amount of research has been done on the employment of people with disabilities in Sweden and it has been found that although employers don't have a direct bias against people with disabilities, they are much more hesitant to hire them because of the future problems that they expect. Although there has been improvement, research has found that the number of adults with mental disabilities is extremely low in the regular workforce. Those that are working and have disabilities often feel that they are being left out of social outings and are given work that isn't relative to their level of skill, which causes dissatisfaction, increasing the chance that they will retire early. = Sheltered employment = One of the solutions for increasing the number of people with disabilities in the workforce has been sheltered employment. In Sweden, there's only one foundation that does this, called Samhall, which was established as a limited liability company in 1992 and receives government funding and subsidies to train their workers. Unlike most other countries, Sweden doesn't have any legislation or policies that are directed at sheltered employment policies. In Sweden, the average age of a worker with a disability in sheltered employment is 46 years old and the average time that a person with a disability works there is around 8 years. Unlike many other countries, Sweden allows these workers with disabilities to sign a contract that is identical to what a general worker would sign. Another unique factor in Sweden is that almost 100% of workers with disabilities working in sheltered employment jobs are members of a union, guaranteeing them collective bargaining. The main goal of sheltered employment is to offer people with disabilities the opportunity to work with the same rights that they would have if they didn't have a disability. It also can help persons get back into the regular workforce, although, this is rare depending upon their disability.

Hara was best known for his time at Tupperware, where he served as a President and CEO of Tupperware Worldwide for 20 years. Under his leadership, the company expanded to over 35 countries and 23 manufacturing plants.  Biography  During World War II, Hara served in the South Pacific as a radio operator on airplanes. He started his career as a door-to-door stocking salesman. Shortly after, he and his brother Sam Hara opened Hara's Linen and Children's Wear in Chicago. In 1951 Hara learned about a burgeoning product called Tupperware. He established his first distributorship, Par-T-Wise, with his cousin Jim Hara. Par-T-Wise quickly grew to become the largest Tupperware distributorship in the U.S with 35 managers and over 800 sales agents. In 1963, Hara divided his Midwest distributorship into 8 different territories and sold them off to move to Orlando with his family to join the Tupperware management team as Vice President of Sales. In Orlando, Hara forged strong relationships with Tupperware President Hamer Wilson and Chairman, Justin Dart. In 1966, Hara was named as the President of Tupperware, U.S. and in 1970 he was promoted to President of Tupperware, International. Under Hara's leadership, Tupperware experienced unprecedented growth worldwide. Hara was featured on CBS's 60 Minutes in 1976 alongside Morley Safer. Hara was an early champion of women in the workplace. In 2016 he wrote the following remembrance of his tenure leading Tupperware. \\"In the past 70 years of my life I have had the enormous pleasure of witnessing the untapped reservoir of female intelligence. The truth is that women dominate intellectually. I have observed this in my economic life having been exposed to thousands of women who, being made aware there are no restrictions, no limit to what they are free to achieve, do incredible things.\\"  Philanthropy  Hara and his wife were extremely active in Orlando and the Jewish Community. They were particularly proud of their involvement with JFS, an organization that provides food and counseling to people from all walks of life. They had also been longtime supporters of: The Jewish Federation of Orlando, the Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center, TOP Jewish Foundation, Foundation for Blindness, Habitat for Humanity, Orlando Museum of Art, United Way Human Resources, Friends of Santa Claus, The Jewish Academy, Congregation Ohev Shalom, Kinneret Council on Aging, the Brevard Music Festival, among others. They had both served on many of their boards throughout the years.  Personal Life and Death  Hara and his wife Anita Greenberg were married in 1947 in Chicago and resided in Longwood, Florida. They had 3 children, 6 grandchildren and 2 great grandchildren. Hara died on December 24, 2017 surrounded by his family in his home in Longwood, Florida.

This ecosystem is home to hundreds of species of both fauna and flora. It includes small mammals such as pygmy rabbits, reptiles such as the sagebrush lizard, birds such as the golden eagles, and countless other species that are solely found in this ecosystem. This ecosystem at one point occupied over 62 million hectares in the western United States and southwestern Canada. It currently only occupies about 56 percent of historic range and is continuing to decline due to several factors.  Location  Great Basin Sagebrush Ecosystem Sagebrush steppe ecosystems occur in Nevada and parts of Utah, Oregon, Idaho, and California. Its western edge is defined by the Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Range, and its eastern edge is the Wasatch Mountains. The northern boundary is the Snake river, and its southern boundary is defined by the Mojave dessert in California.  Threats  Some sagebrush ecosystems rely on recurrent fire. Due to the disruption of the fire cycle, several species have encroached on sagebrush. These species that threaten the sagebrush are: =Conifer woodlands= Conifer woodlands consist of two main species: Juniperus or Junipers and Pinus or Pinyon. These conifers are able to establish and increase in density to the point where sagebrush are outcompeted because they cannot get adequate sunlight and nutrients from the soil. This decline in sagebrush has fragmented sagebrush habitats and caused a disruption in the fauna (e.g., sage grouse). Predation may increase in fragment habitats due to lack of cover for the prey. Agropyron cristatum or cheatgrass =Exotic annual grasses= Several exotic grasses have come into these sagebrush ecosystem and have been labeled noxious weeds which is determined by the agricultural authority. The two main annual grasses that are causes much of the problems are: Bromus tectorum or cheatgrass and Agropyron cristatum or chested wheatgrass. Both species enter areas that have been recently disturbed and rapidly expand into their surroundings through massive growth and seed production. These grasses are so effective because they produce above ground biomass sooner and thicker than competitors and block them out.Morris, Lesley R., Gunnell, Kevin L., Johanson, Jamin K., Monaco, Thomas A., Williams, Justin R, Morris, Lesley R, Gunnell, Kevin L, Johanson, Jamin K, and Monaco, Thomas A. \\"Variation in Sagebrush Communities Historically Seeded with Crested Wheatgrass in the Eastern Great Basin.\\" Rangeland Ecology & Management. 70.6 (2017): 683-90. Web. These exotic grasses alter the natural fire regime and cause an increase in fire frequencies because while these grasses outcompete early on they also dry out in the summer and provide fuel for fire that ultimately cause fires to spread faster and with greater frequency. Fire Fires are both a natural and man- made influence in these systems that help: reduce hazards, control species both desirable and undesirable, improve access and visibility, disease control, and lastly fires in these habitats have been used to create varying stages of succession in an area. Thus fires may increase biodiversity. For example, fires may reduce competition and provide opportunities for herbaceous flora. For the first three decades after a burn there is a drastic increase in the production of grasses, followed by a reestablishment of sagebrush. By having areas in varying stages of succession, the effects of major events like wildfires and diseases are likely to be less severe than if landscape patterns were more uniform.  Restoration efforts  Traditional conservation efforts usually focus on single species, which are extremely expensive and have finite results. Comprehensive conservation plans focus on entire ecosystems and benefit numerous species in a more effective way. Currently the Great Basin has seen more traditional conservation plans and would greatly benefit from a more comprehensive plan to help preserve the more than 350 species of sagebrush associated fauna and flora. Sagebrush Restoration = Conifer woodlands = Conifer woodlands are controlled primarily through the uses of chainsaws, heavy equipment and prescribed fires. This ensures that woodlands are reduced and sagebrush are restored by decreasing the woody fuel load and allowing adequate perennial fauna composition for restoration and recovery. = Exotic annual grasses = Exotic annual grasses are controlled through number of ways: physical removal, chemical means, introduction of cattle for grazing, and prescribed fires. All of which are extremely expensive and labor- intensive due to the rapid nature of its spread. All of these control methods can also be potentially harmful to sagebrush if not properly implemented.

After being featured in the 2010 Sue Bourne documentary Jig as a competitor at the 2010 Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne (Irish Dancing World Championships), O'Rourke became known as a public face for the dance form globally. She won several further titles before her retirement from competition in 2017.  Dancing career  O'Rourke began taking Irish stepdance classes at the age of 5 after seeing a classmate at elementary school perform the style in a show and tell session. She began lessons at the Petri School of Irish Dancing (later the Doherty-Petri School) in Garden City Park, and continued at the same school until her retirement from competition. At her first feis, she won a first prize. In 2010, O'Rourke was selected to be featured in Jig. The documentary followed her preparation for the World Championships, that year held in Glasgow, Scotland, including competition at several other major competitions held by An Coimisi√∫n Le Rinc√≠ Gaelacha around the world that year. O'Rourke won her first World Championship that year in her age group. As her career progressed, O'Rourke competed at three to five competitions outside the United States each year, usually including the All Ireland and All Scotland Championships. In 2012, O'Rourke suffered a major back injury, which resulted in an unusually low placing of 24th at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne 2013. She did not compete for some months, but trained intensively throughout 2013 and won a second world title in 2014. That year, Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne was held for the first time in England and O'Rourke featured on the BBC program Newsnight. O'Rourke won further titles at Oireachtas Rince na Cruinne in 2015 and 2017. She announced her retirement in June of that year. During her career, O'Rourke was described as an \\"ambassador\\" for Irish dance and as a symbol of the increased diversity and globalisation of the dance form. In 2017, shortly before her retirement, O'Rourke was named one of five \\"Top Irish dance influencers\\" by IrishCentral.  Personal life  O'Rourke is the first of two children of father Kevin, originally from County Louth, Ireland, and Filipino mother Annelyn, both of whom are accountants. She attended St. Agnes Cathedral School in Rockville Centre, New York and Sacred Heart Academy in Hempstead. O'Rourke now began attending the University of Delaware in 2017 and has announced her intention to study physical therapy.

As a radio network, NSN developed a 10 Radio Station network to broadcast these tournaments. The television broadcasts carried in Reno and Las Vegas were the only statewide broadcasts of radio and television for these events. NSN worked with Television and Radio talent from the Reno area, along with Nevada talent. The Nevada Sports Network website worked with Rivals Network. FOX (KVVU) 5 developed a High School Broadcast with Dave Hall and Alex Shelton that aired for 2 years in the Las Vegas market. NSN is the national abbreviation for Nevada Sports Network and is national resource for coverage of Nevada events for National Radio Networks, Top 50 Radio markets. Their Radio Show - Sports Line aired in Las Vegas for 7 years working with KSHP 1400 General Manager Brett Grant, Fred Weinberg of KRLV 1340 and Lotus Radio in Reno and Las Vegas and Lee Pete - the legendary Las Vegas Sports Broadcaster. NSN is a partner with the NIAA and has worked with UNLV and UNR regarding radio and television broadcasts, network growth, sponsorships. Additionally as an events manager NSN oversees local events. The largest and most well known of these events is the Las Vegas International Beer Festival. Nevada Sports Network developed the Nevada Sports Network Basketball Classic NSN, in conjunction with Grace Media Unlimited, produced the Dollar General Bowl each year until 2015. In previous seasons they also produced the Music City Bowl, the Sun Bowl, the Heart of Dallas Bowl, the Military Bowl, the Humanitarian Bowl, and others. Until 2014 NSN produced a national game of the week for SiriusXM and for other interested stations. Among the broadcasts produced were every edition of the WAC Football Championships. However other national radio companies (Touchdown Radio, Sports USA, Compass Media) have taken many of NSN's broadcasts opportunities away causing the company to get out of the weekly national broadcast business and focus solely on programming the rights for the Las Vegas sports radio stations. With bowl ties going back to 1996, NSN was the longest bowl production company for college football, a title now held by ESPN Radio. Before Nevada Sports Network Westwood One held that title until they gave up rights to the Cotton Bowl and Gator Bowl to ESPN Radio. ESPN Radio obtained Radio Broadcasts leveraging their Television Broadcast Deals. The over growth of college bowl games and growth of ESPN Owned Games, rights fees increased to amounts that did not justify rights fees and ESPN Radio Stations slowed their broadcasting of live sporting events.

Brock, Charles Earl Palmer, Linda A. Herrington, Cost Accounting: Principles and Applications (1989), p. 547. In certain professions, particularly in law firms, employees are required to bill a certain number of hours per month or per year, and those who bill more hours may obtain additional benefits such as larger bonuses or faster promotions. However, the practice of using billable hours has also been criticized for a number of reasons. Various forms of technology have been developed to track the billable hours generated by employees. Use Billable hours are the most used by most private lawyers and law firms to calculate the value of their work, with clients being assessed \\"a set rate, plus expenses, for each hour that the lawyer ‚Äî or those working with the lawyer ‚Äî devote to the case\\".John Parry, Disability Discrimination Law, Evidence and Testimony (ABA 2008), p. 113. Billable hours are \\"the hours for which clients are charged\\", while \\"some hours worked by the firms staff are not billable because the staff members are not involved in a consulting job for a client\\". The terminology is not uniform across industries, as \\"lawyers, consultants and accountants use the term 'billable hours', while marketing communications firms refer to 'utilization rates' or 'chargeability'\\".Patrick J. McKenna, David H. Maister, First Among Equals: How To Manage A Group Of Professionals (2012), p. xxv. The primary alternatives to billable hours are flat fees for specific transactions, or the assessment of a contingent fee for the entirety of a given matter. Criticisms One court has noted that \\"problems created by billable hours have brought about a storm of criticism directed to the legal profession, especially when there are excessive billable hours\\".Avila v. Coca-Cola Co., 728 F.Supp. 685, 715 (M.D. Fla. 1989). Criticisms of billable hours include the fact that a person doing more hours of work is not necessarily doing a high quality of work, and that work quality may in fact be diminished over time by an excessive workload. Lawyers trying to increase their billable hours may behave in ways that are not in the interests of the client. Furthermore, billable hours often do not encompass all of the work that employees are required to do, for example excluding work for the firm that is not billed to a particular client. It has been noted that firms with high billable hours requirements may lag behind in terms of pro bono work, and that other tasks falling outside of the billable hours requirement may be given inadequate attention. Billable hours \\"create an economic incentive for lawyers to charge for every hour of work that can be identified\\".

It operated from the grounds of the Baroque Ludwigsburg Palace. After a first two decades that were artistically, but not financially, successful, the factory went into a slow decline and was closed in 1824. Much later a series of other companies used the Ludwigsburg name, but the last production was in 2010.Marshall, Ludwigsburg (01); Battie, p. 100 A similar range of wares was made to other German factories. Tableware was most often painted with European flowers, and Ludwigsburg made little in chinoiserie styles, already somewhat past their most fashionable. Figures were a relatively large proportion of production compared to other German factories, and included series of court ballet dancers, peasants, and musicians. There were some (more than usually) miniature groups on bases, with figures some three inches high, including ones showing the annual \\"Venetian fair\\" held at the court, and some groups satirizing court fashions. Beyer produced more monumental figures in an early Neoclassical style, including a set of musicians.Battie, p. 100 Part of a service with the Martinelli-Giovanelli arms, by Gottlieb Friedrich Riedel, 1762‚Äì1763 The original manufactory became famous for its figurines, which are interesting because they very likely were modelled directly on the costumes used in the court ballet, another enthusiasm of Duke Charles Eugene. Between 1760 and 1766 he had managed to entice to Stuttgart the innovative choreographer and ballet master Jean-Georges Noverre, then out of favour in Paris. One of Noverre's innovations was using lighter costumes allowing the dancer to move freely, shown in some of the figure groups, as the one illustrated here, but not all.Le Corbelier, p. 290; for example, this figure pair shows the older style The 18th-century factory mark was two \\"C\\"s interlocked in blue, with one reversed, with or without a ducal coronet above.Battie, p. 100; An example without coronet, from The Coiffure. History Turk on a rhinoceros, c. 1755‚Äì1760 Until the 18th century, porcelain had to be imported into Europe from East Asia and was thus rare on the continent. The first European hard-paste porcelain factory was that making Meissen porcelain from 1710, followed by Vienna porcelain in 1718, the in 1746, F√ºrstenberg and Nymphenburg in 1747, Berlin in 1751, and then the Frankenthal factory in 1755. France and England at the same time saw the foundations of the workshops at Chantilly in 1725, the S√®vres factory in 1738, and London's Chelsea porcelain factory in 1743.Battie, pp. 88‚Äì100, 106‚Äì109, 118, 121 Attempts at producing porcelain in Ludwigsburg had been made since 1724 under Eberhard Louis, Duke of W√ºrttemberg.Campbell, p. 63 Ludwigsburg was a poor site for a porcelain manufactory, as it was not located near abundant woodland or clay deposits. Transportation of materials was difficult and therefore expensive. From 1751 on, Charles Eugene also attempted to make porcelain at Ludwigsburg but was unsuccessful.Munger & Sullivan, pp. 125‚Äì26 Then in January 1759, he hired , who had worked at Vienna, H√∂chst, Strasbourg, Frankenthal, and Nymphenburg, to direct Ludwigsburg's porcelain factory.Munger & Sullivan, p. 125 Within months, Ringler was in charge of 35 employees. Among them was , a modeller who had worked at Meissen, Frankenthal, and H√∂chst, and Johann Wilhelm Beyer, better known for his later work as a sculptor in Vienna. Although the porcelain manufactory was not profitable and relied on Charles Eugene's patronage, by the early 1760s it produced a large variety of high quality porcelain wares based on the duke's tastes. Most of the dancer figurines were modelled by Joseph Nees, from 1760 to 1763, and are notable for their capturing the movement of a dance.Munger & Sullivan, p. 126 Its most successful period was between about 1764 and 1775, having its best success in Holland.Marryat, p. 349 By the 1790s the factory was seriously in decline. After the dukes became Kings of W√ºrttemberg on the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1805, the official name of the factory changed to Herzoglich- K√∂nigliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Ludwigsburg (\\"Ducal/Royal porcelain factory Ludwigsburg\\"). It had never been profitable, and later dukes lost interest and resented the expense until it was closed in 1824, after attempts to find a buyer had failed. The moulds, recipes, and books were archived when the manufactory closed. The period was a difficult one financially for many German factories. The Coiffure, 5 inches high, c. 1770. One of the men inspects the top of the coiffure through a telescope. Porcelain The Ludwigsburg body was much \\"greyer and smokier in tone\\" than other German factories. The Encyclop√©die M√©thodique describes Ludwigsburg porcelain as resisting sudden change in temperature and fire, but that the glazing and desired white color of the product was inferior to Frankenthal porcelain. The first marking stamped onto Ludwigsburg porcelain consisted of two intersecting Cs topped with a crown,Chaffers, p. 185 possibly inspiring the nickname \\"Kronenburg\\", though sometimes the crown did not appear above the letters. From 1758 to 1770, Ludwigsburg porcelain was marked with a crown and the letters \\"T.R.\\", though the arms of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg also appeared rarely.Marryat, p. 349; Chaffers, p. 186 Every piece of Ludwigsburg porcelain made from 1948 to 2009 has a \\"Decorator Signature\\" in addition to standard manufactory markings. The largest and best collection is in the palace where it was made, in the Keramikmuseum, a branch of the Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg, which has 2,000 pieces. Later companies Modern Porzellan-Manufaktur Ludwigsburg GmbH \\"Poppy\\" pattern In 1904, the W√ºrttembergische Porzellanmanufaktur Bauer & Pfeiffer, though located in Schorndorf, became the first successor to the palace manufactory under the mark of a crown and the words \\"Alt-Ludwigsburg\\". The government of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg allowed the company's operations, despite the questionable legality of its marks, and by 1913 it had 200 employees. In 1917, the company went public and filed for permission to use the royal manufactory's marks. This was granted in 1918 on the condition that the W√ºrttembergische Porzellanmanufaktur would add its initials (WPM) to avoid passing off.Marshall, Schorndorf and Ludwigsburg (02) However, the company's chief decorator wanted to use the royal manufactory's markings with no alteration, and left the company over the issue. In February 1919, he formed the Porzellan-Manufaktur Alt-Ludwigsburg GmbH in Ludwigsburg itself. Alt- Ludwigsburg was sued by the W√ºrttembergische Porzellanmanufaktur in the Ludwigsburg district courts on 13 June 1919. In the final ruling, on 12 December 1919, Alt-Ludwigsburg was forced to adopt new markings and became a court-managed company that, in 1921, was entrusted with producing Notgeld. Alt-Ludwigsburg then ran into financial troubles and was dissolved in 1927, while the WPM was successful for a time before also being dissolved in 1934.Marshall, Schorndorf and Ludwigsburg (02) In 1926, Otto Wanner-Brandt desired to recreate the successes of the original porcelain manufactory. He purchased the manufactory's trademark rights for 50 years, but was unable to found the Porzellan-Manufaktur Ludwigsburg GmbH until 1948, in Ludwigsburg. The venture was an immediate success, as Wanner-Brandt's use of the original moulds and glaze compositions allowed patrons to order exact recreations of Ludwigsburg porcelains. The manufactory moved to Ludwigsburg Palace in 1967, and in 1994 was recognized by the W√ºrttembergische Hypothekenbank for preserving the tradition of porcelain-making in the city. The establishment of an advisory and quality control board in the next year reaffirmed that commitment for reproductions and new wares. Like other porcelain factories, the manufactory was a subsidizing company whose losses were borne by its shareholders. In 2002, those shareholders subsidized ‚Ç¨2 million. However, it ran into financial trouble, and in 2004Marshall, Ludwigsburg (01) was taken over by EganaGoldpfeil. When EganaGoldpfeil went bankrupt, the manufactory also filed for bankruptcy in the Ludwigsburg district courts on 29 August 2008. After months of searching, a buyer for the manufactory was found in Lucas A.G., a Swiss holding firm with Russian investors. Now called Schlossmanufaktur Ludwigsburg GmbH, the manufacturing of contemporary porcelain at Ludwigsburg Palace resumed and the lease on space in the palace was extended to 31 December 2015. However, the business was not a success, and the last production was in 2010, when an expensive problem with the kiln developed. CEO Maxim Gennel confirmed that the company filed for bankruptcy in March 2014, but was then confident that the company would survive. A lawyer in Stuttgart, Stephan R√ºdlin, became the insolvency administrator. The closure of the manufactory was announced in October 2015.

She was the first of several tankers ordered by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen for their oil-carrying operations in the Pacific. Design and Construction In 1911 an English firm Fearnley & Eger and Wilhelm Wilhelmsen established the \\"Norwegian Africa and Australia Line\\" (NAAL). At about the same time the two companies also took over the \\"Norway Mexico Gulf Line\\" (NMGL) involved in oil and oil products transportation to South America. In 1913 the company ordered their first tanker to serve the California-South America route for NOK 1,862,527.25. The ship was laid down in 1913 at Sir James Laing & Sons Ltd. shipyard at Deptford, launched on November 14, 1913 (yard number 644), and commissioned on December 20 of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . San Joaquin was assessed at 6,987 GRT, and 10,360 DWT. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 555 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to . Operational history San Joaquin was delivered to Wilhelm Wilhemsen on December 20, 1913. Upon delivery, she was chartered by the Union Oil Company for 10 years and immediately sailed to San Francisco. San Joaquin left Newcastle-upon-Tyne on Christmas Day 1913 and on February 27, 1914 arrived on the US West Coast.Weekly Commercial News,v.48, No.1, p.15 (1914)Weekly Commercial News,v.48, No.9, p.13 (1914) The ship left San Francisco on March 8 for Chilean ports of Iquique and Antofagasta, stopping off to load oil at Port San Luis, the major oil storage and shipping facility for Union Oil.Weekly Commercial News,v.48, No.11, p.11 (1914) San Joaquin arrived in Antofagasta on March 29, and departed two days later for Iquique, before returning to San Francisco in mid April.Weekly Commercial News,v.48, No.14, p.11 (1914) For the remainder of 1914 and through 1918 San Joaquin continued transporting oil from Port San Luis in California to Chilean ports of Taltal, Iquique, Antofagasta, and Tocopilla, with occasional trips to and from Mexico, or up the West Coast of the US. In 1919 San Joaquin was moved to the Gulf of Mexico, as Union Oil sought to fulfill its South American contracts by buying oil from Mexico. The tanker made regular trips from Tampico and Tuxpan on the Gulf Coast of Mexico to the same Chilean ports through early 1922.Panama Canal Record,v.12, pp.212,277,312,354,368,428,456,496,518,554,624Panama Canal Record,v.15, pp.193,208,293,306,357,394,435,456 In April 1922 she returned to the West Coast, and delivered oil to Victoria on May 25, 1922,Weekly Commercial News,v.64, No.21, p.11 (1922) before resuming her South American routes. By mid-1920s Wilhelm Wilhelmsen started to pull out of oil-carrying business, concentrating instead on oceanic liners. As a result, the company started slowly disposing of its tanker fleet. San Joaquin was acquired in June 1929 by a Norwegian whaling company A/S Hektor (operated by Nils Bugge) and renamed Melville. Hektor operated a whaling station on Deception Island and Melville served as a transportation ship for the company. Melville also transported members, equipment and aircraft of Sir George Hubert Wilkins's expedition in late 1929 on their way to the South Shetland Islands.Headland, p.285 Hektor invested a lot of resources in their whaling business in 1930, however, overproduction and a financial crisis led to a collapse of the market, and the entire Norwegian and part of the foreign whaling fleet had to be laid up in the 1931/32 season. As the company‚Äôs financial position weakened, Hektor had to negotiate with their creditors to obtain a deferral which after prolonged negotiations was successfully obtained in 1936. However, as a result, the company had to sell most of its ships, including Melville which was bought in 1935 by a Greek Hellenic Tramp S.S. Co. who renamed the ship Iolcos. =Sinking= Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Greece declared neutrality. However, Metaxas saw the war as a great opportunity of making money and rearming Greek Armed Forces by selling ammunition and weapons to both parties of the conflict. Nationalists were furious with the Greeks selling weapons to Republicans, and even submitted a dossier to Greek ambassador in Burgos proving Greek government was complicit in selling arms to the Republicans.Pelt, pp. 164-165 As a result, most Greek ships travelling in the Western Mediterranean were considered by Spanish Nationalists, as well as their German and Italian allies, as enemies. On September 1, 1937 Iolcos which was just recently renamed Woodford and in the process of being transferred to the British registry, was on her journey from Constanta to Valencia with a full load of fuel oil. The tanker just made a call in Barcelona on August 27 but was unable to unload her cargo, and was travelling along the east coast of Spain.Malaya Tribune, 3 September 1937, Page 13 The ship was under command of captain Gregorij Dimitrov, a Bulgarian, and had a crew of 32 composed mostly of Greeks, Romanians and Hungarians. Around 06:30 in the morning, sighted the tanker near Benicarl√≥ heading to Alicante. Not being able to catch up with the ship under water, Diaspro attacked the ship on the surface by launching two torpedoes. The ship crew spotted them, managed to maneuver and avoid them altogether, and made an attempt to ram the submarine. Diaspro fired two more torpedoes which hit the ship on the starboard side, around holds 5 and 8, and sank it in the position .Giorgerini, p. 197 Even though the ship was travelling under the British flag, the captain of the submarine, Giuseppe Mellina, believed the tanker was using a false name Woodford, as the crew appeared to be Romanian. As a result of the attack, the ship's second engineer died and six people were wounded. The rest of the tanker's crew successfully reached the Spanish coast.

She was not selected on either occasion as part of the party's assembly delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, Serbian parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for mandates to be awarded out of numerical order. Although the Radical Party won seventy-eight mandates in the 2008 election, Mihajloviƒá did not automatically receive a mandate by virtue of her list position and was ultimately not chosen.)Serbia's Law on the Election of Representatives (2000) stipulated that parliamentary mandates would be awarded to electoral lists (Article 80) that crossed the electoral threshold (Article 81), that mandates would be given to candidates appearing on the relevant lists (Article 83), and that the submitters of the lists were responsible for selecting their parliamentary delegations within ten days of the final results being published (Article 84).

Her initial path was to follow her father in the pharmaceutical business and she excelled in this and having become one of the first women to become a pharmacist. This continued after the death of her father when she assumed control of the business and later stepped aside for her brother to take over when it became clear that she felt inclined to enter the religious life. Her time in the convent saw her assume leadership roles in which she was protective of her fellow nuns with an amiable disposition. But the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War forced her to flee into hiding alongside another nun while refusing her brother's invitation to live with him since she wanted to ensure her fellow religious were kept safe. But she herself was captured and later shot dead in the middle of the night when the militia grew furious with her silence during interrogations. Her death caused for widespread calls for the beatification process to be introduced and which later opened in 1962 under Pope John XXIII; she became titled as a Servant of God once the cause commenced. Pope John Paul II beatified Moragas in mid-1998 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Elvira Moragas Cantarero was born in Lillo in Toledo in 1881 as the third of four children born to Ricardo Moragas and Isabel Cantarero. Her father worked as a pharmacist and took control of the business from his father Severiano Moragas. Her elder sister Sagrario (born in 1879) died in 1890. The Moragas' moved to Madrid in 1886 after King Alfonso XIII appointed her father as a pharmaceutical advisor to the monarch; the Moragas' had been in El Prado from 1885 and in Madrid lived at 97 Bravo Murillo Street above their store. It was there that she became intrigued with her father's work and so desired following him in that career path; those around her noted her as being determined to succeed in this goal. Her initial education was at the San Fernando school before going to high school at the Cardinal Cisneros Institute prior to her college studies from 1900 to 1905. In 1887 she received her Confirmation. Moragas became an excellent student in school and achieved top results while passing her baccalaureate on 29 June 1889. In 1900 she became one of the first women to have entered the pharmaceutical department of the college in Madrid. Moragas obtained her pharmacist's license on 16 June 1905. The death of her father in 1909 saw her assume control of his business so as to support her mother and siblings; her mother died later in 1911. In 1915 her brother Ricardo graduated as a pharmacist and he took over the business so that his sister could follow her call into the religious life. Her spiritual director around this time was Jos√© Mar√≠a Rubio Peralta. On 21 June 1915 she was accepted as a postulant at the Saints Anne and Joseph convent in Madrid. On 21 December 1915 she was vested in the habit and received her new religious name in a rite that marked her entrance into the novitiate period of formation. Her first vows were made on 24 December 1916 in the convent while her solemn profession of her vows was celebrated on 6 January 1920. On 18 April 1927 she was appointed as her house's prioress and she held that position until 1930 when she served as novice mistress until 1936. Moragas was again invested with the position of prioress on 1 July 1936 and would hold the position until her death. On 20 July 1936 a large mob attacked their convent so she spirited her fellow religious to safe haven while seeking shelter with Sister Teresa Mar√≠a in the home of the latter's parents. It was around this point that her brother asked her to come live with him in a neighbouring village for her to remain safe. But she refused the offer and said that she had to watch over her sisters. But she and her companion were arrested on 14 August. During interrogations she remained silent as her questioners asked where the convent's valuables were being hidden since raids revealed nothing of value. Instead her silence caused great anger to her interrogators who pressed her for information. Her refusal prompted a militiaman to give her a piece of paper in which she wrote: \\"¬°Viva Cristo Rey!\\" (Long live Christ the King). This infuriated the militiamen who decided to kill her if no information could be obtained from her. Moragas was shot dead at the San Isidro hermitage after being transported there during the late evening on 15 August before midnight. Beatification The beatification process opened in Madrid in an informative process of investigation that was launched on 22 October 1962 and later closed in the archdiocesan cathedral on 15 February 1965; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated the process on 14 December 1984 after two decades of inaction. The Positio dossier was drafted and sent to the C.C.S. in 1990 for additional assessment with theologians approving the cause's direction on 7 June 1996; the C.C.S. likewise approved the cause on 21 January 1997. Pope John Paul II confirmed her beatification on 8 March 1997 after confirming that Moragas had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) which meant no miracle would be required for beatification. The pope presided over the beatification rites in Saint Peter's Square on 10 May 1998. The current postulator for this cause is the Discalced Carmelite priest Romano Gambalunga. =Patronage= Moragas is the patron for pharmacists. In 1998 the Archbishop of Madrid Cardinal Antonio Mar√≠a Rouco Varela had even proposed her as a patron for pharmacists on the occasion of her beatification.

It was above 10% in 2018 and down to 7.1% by the end of 2019 - the lowest level since 2011. Overall youth unemployment rate in South Korea According to OECD, the youth unemployment rate (total % of youth labor force aged 15‚Äì24 year old) in Republic of Korea(ROK) is as follows: 10.2% in 2001, 8.5% in 2002, 10.05% in 2003, 10.43% in 2004, 10.15% in 2005, 9.95% in 2006, 8.79% in 2007, 9.27% in 2008, 9.84% in 2009, 9.77% in 2010, 9.61% in 2011, 8.99% in 2010, 9.34% in 2013, 10.03% in 2014, 10.52% in 2015, 10.68% in 2016 and 7.10% in 2019. More specifically, the total youth unemployment rate between ages 15 to 29 rose from 7.9% in 2001 to 9.8% in 2016, whilst rising from 6.1% to 9.2% amongst 25-29 year olds. It has been decreasing since then until a low of 7.1% in 2019. In terms of youth inactivity, 7.7% is looking for jobs or attending job training programs while 3.1% are purely inactive, not working, having education nor attending job training programs. OECD Youth Unemployment Rate (15‚Äì24 year olds) from 2001 to 2016 NEET One of the youth unemployment issues in South Korea is youth inactiveness, where there are growing numbers of inactive youth, defined as the NEET(Not in Education Employment or Training). The youth in South Korea prefer high education to increase and develop their employability in the labor market rather than seeking jobs, which leads them to become inactive. The reaffirming factors that reduce the chance of employment include: socioeconomic status, household characteristics, and family income. Since 2009, the size of youth NEET is about 20%, higher than the OECD average. Although the proportion of NEET non- job seekers decreased, job seekers of NEET increased. Since 2015, the NEET unemployed remained high, overtaking NEET inactive. These youth NEET are categorizable into income groups, where the highest was low income household, and the lowest was the high income household. The NEET rate of low income youth is 37.7% in 2014, while that of high income is only 9.5% in 2014. Structural causes of unemployment =Education= Over the past two decades, the number of students enrolled in tertiary education has quadrupled. As of 2007, 80% of college graduates were job seekers while only 30% of jobs demand highly educated workers. With the recent overabundance of high school and college graduates, the requirements of the labor market mismatch the skills provided by the education system. Poor school-business networks, insufficient employment service infrastructure, and asymmetric labor market information also result in limited possibilities for combining study and work.  Suneung  Suneung, also known as the CSAT (College Scholastic Ability Test), is a series of tests taken for eight hours in one day. The test is usually taken by students in their senior year of high school, which some students call \\"the year of hell\\". South Korean households hold education as a priority in their cultural value, believing good education will lead their children to successful careers and lives. Suneung is held every year in November, and the test is said to determine which university a student will attend, as well as future employment and wages. Korean students vie for entry to Seoul National University, Korea University, and Yonsei University, collectively known as \\"SKY,\\" because those institutions are known to support the connections needed to be employed in government or family-owned conglomerates (chaebols) that come with employee benefits. To prepare for the Suneung, South Korean parents invest thousands of dollars in tutoring and private education for years of their children's education. South Korea has about 100,000 hagwons (cram/private schools) and in 2017, over 80% of all Korean students attended cram schools. In 2010, around 75% of students attended private education; families spend roughly US$217 a month for years in elementary school, middle school, and high school. The private education industry in Korea is estimated to be worth around US$20 billion. Due to high costs, parents have decided to have less children in order to invest quality education for them. Though families emphasize a great deal for the education, the employment in South Korea's job market from Korea's conglomerates are not guaranteed. In 2016, around 3.34 million degree holders in South Korea had delayed entering the job market in order to seek higher education or find other full-time employment opportunities. According to the OECD, South Korea ranks the highest in population between the age 25‚Äì34 years old with tertiary education out of all OECD countries. As a result of investment in private education to test well in Suneung, domestic consumption has dropped for the middle class in Korea, causing a strain in the economy.  Mental health and fertility issues  In South Korea, the number one cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 to 30 years old is suicide. South Korea ranked the highest in suicide rates out all OECD nations, along with the highest stress levels for youth between the ages of 11 to 15 years old. South Korea spent around 7.3% of its GDP on health expenditures in 2016, but as of 2014, only 2.6% of those health expenditures (US$43 million) was for the mental health budget. In part due to high suicide rates and unease about expensive education, South Korea's population has the lowest fertility rate out of all OECD countries. Low fertility and an aging population are predicted to reduce tax revenue in the future, which would burden South Korea's welfare system and universal healthcare. Poor welfare could then lead to worsening of the mental illness issue and other social issues. Should the issue remain unaddressed, high costs of education and low fertility will further decrease South Korean domestic consumption, which will lead to slower economic growth. =Segmented groups= The cause of unemployment is different for each segmented group. High school graduate and college dropouts have a higher rate of job separation than college graduates. High job separation is due to the mismatch between jobs and workers, where workers cannot attain jobs they prefer. There is also a low performance for temporary employees and seasonal workers. =Other structural problems= Employment regulations deter youths moving from non- regular employment to regular employment, worsening labor market duality. Non- unemployed youth, especially those with lower education, do not receive assistance for job seeking. Labor market rigidities including inflexible wages, high non-wage costs and employment protection also cause youth unemployment. High employment protection, combined with low standardization of the education system, satisfies a condition for high NEET rate. Additionally, the public sector's investment in regional vocational training is weak, and the private sector, including large enterprises, marginally invests in vocational training. =Economic downturns= South Korea's economic downturns and reduced international competitiveness also cause youth unemployment. Due to the slowing economic growth rate of 3% since 2003, and the coefficient of employment (number of employed workers per every one billion won of GDP) dropping by half of the level of 1990 by 2005, the employment absorptive capacity of the labor market reduced drastically., which makes it difficult for college graduates to find jobs. When demand collapses as in times of economic slumps, the young are the first to be dismissed from companies since they have no work experience. Youth are also disadvantaged in entering the labor market as they compete with older employees with job experience, which makes graduates vulnerable to macroeconomic cyclical depressions, leading to high youth unemployment as well as higher precariousness in transitioning from school to work. Policy efforts to mitigate youth unemployment issues =History= Policy efforts to tackle youth unemployment produced a result of increased inactiveness and capped unemployment. From 2004 to 2006, government measures tackled 20% of total unemployment issues, focusing on unemployment of college students and graduates. Implementation was left to the colleges themselves, which made it hard for college students to approach the system voluntarily. Employment Promotion Plan for High School Graduates or Below, in 2006, provided support services to guide job seeking in order to facilitate school to work transition. Also, it supported for vocational high school students, school dropouts and fostering of manual workers. =Recent trends in policy= The recent trends are leaning toward the corporatist policy approach in lieu of the past market driven policy approach. The corporatist approach includes: working hour reduction, public sector jobs reduction, quality improvement in small firm jobs, and expansion of public sector employment. Policy efforts only accounted for .13% of South Korea's GDP, ranking it the second to the lowest among OECD countries in 2006. The newly elected president in 2017, Moon Jae-In, won the election in part by promising to reduce youth unemployment. He has claimed to put top priority to expand the public sector for job creation, saying that he would create 810,000 jobs in the public sector. Moon's administration promised to create 174,000 civil service positions in national security and public safety, 340,000 in social services and convert 300,000 irregular workers to fully employed workers. Also, the government increased minimum wages by 16.4% at 7,530 won per-hour, aiming it to become W10,000 by 2020. Moon Jae-In's administration labor policy had a positive influence in decreasing youth unemployment. As of 2019, the youth unemployment rate was as its lowest level since the late 1990s.

During his life he was a well known scholar of criminal law, and nowadays he is mainly remembered for his history of the University of Rome. Biography He was born in Rome on 4 July 1745 to his Bolognese parents, Ercole Maria and Barbara Montacheti. As soon as he graduated in Law, as early as 1768, at the age of 21, he became a professor at the Archiginnasio Romano (as it was called at the time La Sapienza University of Rome). The following year he was entrusted with the Chair of criminal Law, which he held for 34 years. He was the author of Elements of Criminal Law (Elementa juris criminalis), adopted in many Italian universities as a textbook. In the four volumes that make up this work was the first to attempt a concise critical history of the discipline of criminal law. His criminal doctrine spread throughout Italy and also in France. At the end of the eighteenth century it was among the most representative Italian penalists together with Luigi Cremani and Cesare Beccaria. He was offered the chair of Jurisprudence of the University of Pavia, and in 1803 that of Criminal Law of the University of Bologna, but he refused to stay in Rome. He was called by Empress Catherine II of Russia in St. Petersburg to collaborate in the laborious reform of the Criminal Code, which began in 1767 and lasted for many years. He participated in the government of the 1798-99 Roman Republic, and for this reason at the restoration of the Papal States he was dismissed from teaching. He was shortly restored as professor at the Sapienza University in 1801 up to 1803 when he had to retire. In 1803 he was ascribed to Roman Nobility. Renazzi dedicated the last years of his life to studies and publications, and in particular to his history of the University of Rome (La Sapienza University) published between 1803 and 1806. He died in Rome on 29 June 1808, after 18 days of illness. His funeral monument is located in the entrance portico of the Basilica of Sant'Eustachio in Rome. Works Renazzi's main book related to Criminal Law is Elementa juris criminalis (Elements of criminal Law) in four volumes published in 1773, 1775, 1781, 1786. Renazzi in his book took a stand against the formalist and strict methods of the previous scholarship of criminal Laws, typical of authors such as Prospero Farinacci, moving towards a new, clear and structured approach typical of the Enlightenment, retaining however deep roots in the Roman Law, in the Catholic moral theology and in the classical studies. He cautiously opposed the death penalty and fiercely disapproved the use of torture in trials. He supported the separation of powers and a reduction in the judicial discretion. He slightly supported the inquisitorial system over the adversarial system. Other juridical works of him are: De sortilegio et magia liber singularis (Venice: 1782), where he supports the decriminalization of witchcraft; De ordine seu forma judiciorum criminalium diatriba (Rome: 1777), an outline of the history of criminal Law; and Synopsis elementorum juris criminalis (Rome: 1803), a summary of his Elementa juris criminalis. In his work on the Sapienza University of Rome (Storia dell‚ÄôUniversit√† degli Studi di Roma detta comunemente la Sapienza, Rome: 1803-1806) he not only researches on the history of the university but also outlines the history of Roman culture from the middle ages to his time. He wrote also a history of the Apostolic Palace (Notizie storiche degli antichi vicedomini del patriarchio lateranense e de‚Äô moderni prefetti del sagro Palazzo Apostolico ovvero maggiordomi pontifizi, Rome: 1797). Renazzi wrote three essaysOratio de studiis literarum ad bonum Reipublicae referendis (Rome: 1781), Oratio de optimo scientiarum fine assequendo (Rome: 1796) and Ragionamento sull‚Äôinfluenza della poesia nella morale (Rome: 1797) in polemic with the thought of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, stating that classical studies and poetry have a positive impact on civilization when supported by morality.

Mexico has been offering social welfare since 1999. Despite the fact that Mexico offers welfare to its citizens through various programs, the poverty level in Mexico is currently at 46.2%. More than 10% of those living in poverty are living in extreme poverty, earning $1.25/ day or less. For low-income families In Mexico, the social welfare program for low-income families was originally known as \\"Oportunidades\\", meaning \\"opportunities\\". It was eventually renamed \\"Prospera\\", meaning \\"to prosper\\". The program was established in 1997 and was designed to encourage families to send their children to school and health centres. Nearly six million families have benefited from this program. The goal of the ‚ÄúProspera‚Äù program is to improve the quality of life of the poor in terms of nutrition, education, and health. The program is still available to date for Mexican citizens in need of assistance. In particular, it is highlighted on the Mexican government website for people who are affected by natural disasters and other emergencies. Another program created to help low- income families was the FIDELIST. This program was created in 1984 and essentially subsidized the prices of corn tortillas. It ran until 1990 when it was replaced by the Tortilla sin Costo, which provided subsidized or free tortillas for 2.1 million low-income families and equaled approximately 3% of Mexico‚Äôs total corn consumption. However, the current tortillas program for low-income people in Mexico, as offered by the Mexican government, is to provide a two-year loan at 6% interest to set up a tortilla business; there are no 'free tortillas' for the poor.h[ttp://www.2006-2012.economia.gob.mx/comunidad- negocios/competitividad/una-sola-economia/programas-una-sola-economia/una- economia-mi-tortilla]  Social welfare for children  Children in Mexico can also apply for social welfare, depending on their circumstances. One protection available to them is the DIF (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia), which is a program for family services that are state-run. Children can also benefit from the Prospera program (formerly known as Oportunidades) as mentioned above. According to a study by IFPRI, the International Food Policy Research Institute, Prospera has positively improved factors such as school enrollment, health appointment attendance, and children‚Äôs nutrition. For example, enrollment in school for Prospera children has increased significantly, with girls increasing by 20% and boys increasing by 10%. Some recent program advances have refocused assistance toward children in both rural and urban areas; originally, it was only set up to serve rural children. Now, more children have access to this assistance. Overall, the social welfare of children has been improved by these measures.  For the elderly and disabled  Other groups that are eligible to receive social welfare assistance in Mexico are the elderly and the disabled. The pension age in Mexico is 65 years. The amount given in the pension varies depending on how much the person contributed to the pension program. Pensions are usually 2,253.76 pesos a month. People with disabilities are also given pensions. The average pension for a disabled individual is roughly 2,253.76 pesos a month.  Prospera history  An evolution of the Oportunidades social welfare programme has, in its various forms, given conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to Mexico‚Äôs poorest since the 1990s. The scheme, originally called Pronasol in 1989, before being renamed Progresa in 1997 and Oportunidades in 2002, was the first major social programme of its kind in Latin America. The programme gave poor families cash in exchange for their meeting conditions such as enrolling their children in school and getting regular health check-ups. It went on to inspire other similar schemes across Latin America, including Brazil‚Äôs Bolsa Fam√≠lia ‚Äì perhaps the most well-known and successful of them all.

He was called \\"the Don of Dorƒáol\\". He disappeared on 23 September 1992, after having received a beating from several members of the Arkan's Tigers paramilitary, near the Beograƒëanka building.  Early life  D≈æamba was born in an ethnic Romani family in 1953. He grew up at Dobraƒçina Street in the Belgrade neighborhood of Dorƒáol, where his family shared a yard with D≈æamba's maternal cousin, the singer D≈æej Ramadanovski.  Career in crime  He began his criminal career in his youth. He was jailed at the Central Prison in 1976 for purse snatching and fighting at a bus station in Belgrade. While in prison, D≈æamba memorized the Criminal Code and offered legal advice to other inmates. In prison, he was often and badly beaten up by the Central Prison guards due to his rebellious nature. He was often violent towards rapists and homosexuals. During the 1970s and 1980s, he, as many Yugoslav criminals, committed crimes in Italy, Germany and France, but not in Yugoslavia. At first in conflict with ƒêorƒëe Bo≈æoviƒá \\"Gi≈°ka\\", they became friends while imprisoned in Italy. He was a close associate of Aleksandar \\"Knele\\" Kne≈æeviƒá, underboss in the Vo≈ædovac gang. D≈æamba owned a detective firm called \\"Karmen\\". On several occasions, he led goon squads engaged in breaking up labor strikes in several firms.  Disappearance  He disappeared on 23 September 1992, aged 39, after being beaten up by casino security headed by Vuka≈°in \\"Vule\\" Gojak, a member of the Arkan's Tigers paramilitary. Gojak was guarding the casino on the 6th floor of the Beograƒëanka building. According to Gojak, D≈æamba tried to enter the casino drunk and without a ticket, and brandished a firearm at one of the guards when he was denied access. Gojak claims to not know of his whereabouts after casino security had him removed from the building. According to D≈æamba's wife Sne≈æana Lero, a group of Arkan's Tigers and Delije beat D≈æamba unconscious before driving him off to their camp in Erdut and burying his body there. Campaigning for the 1993 election, politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj claimed Arkan had planned the murder, and that he was in contact with an eyewitness. Allegedly, Arkan and D≈æamba had a falling out in March 1992 when D≈æamba accidentally shot a framed picture of Arkan in the restaurant Zona Zamfirova. According to the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, D≈æamba belonged to a string of murdered criminals from Serbia who all had one thing in common, namely a lack of \\"good backing\\" in the police. The man accused of his murder, Vuka≈°in Gojak, was shot by a sniper in 1997.  Songwriting  In an interview given to Politika, D≈æamba's cousin D≈æej Ramadanovski stated that D≈æamba wrote the lyrics of two songs he later recorded and published. One was \\"Te≈°ko je ≈æiveti\\" from album \\"Zar ja da ti bri≈°em suze\\" and the other was \\"≈Ωuta ru≈æa/To je ≈æena mojih snova\\" published on his album \\"1,2\\".

She is also known for one of the first people in Nepal to promote Christian religion in Nepal after miraculously being saved by a Christian lady. She got engaged with Evangelism in western parts of Nepal where she helped the poors and dominated by providing health-care and also practiced Christian culture there. Background Gyaani Shah was born in a royal family of Malta, Salyan District of Nepal in June 1923. She was born in a high class Thakuri family and somewhat was proud of it too. She is the first Nepalese woman to be captain of Nepalese Army which known to be one of the fiercest troops of army. She is known for her struggle as a Christian woman who struggled in Nepal, a Hindu nation at the time. Childhood She was brought and raised in her grandparents‚Äô house from mother side because of her mother's death after a year of her birth. She came to Kathmandu the capital city of Nepal when she was 9yrs old to be with her relatives Ranas‚Äô. But, because of the conflict within the Rana community made her relatives and her to go out of Nepal and her journey to India begins with it. Conversion to Christianity While traveling with her relatives in India, she was also going through all the religious cities of Hinduism and was also partaking and fulfilling all the religious rites. But one night while staying in Varanasi she felt a desire to be a jogini (a monk) and so ran away from her home to go to Calcutta but in her way there she alighted in Patna where she was about to be sold by the people there was miraculously saved by a Christian lady and was send to a secure place in a Mission Hospital, in Patna. While staying in the hospital she worked as a sweeper for several months and later as a cook for couple of years. These works in her caste was never to be done but she did it without complaining and did it with full peace and joy. In her own words she said that, ‚ÄúGod knew that I was born into a proud family and I could never accept Him in my pride, so He made me humble so that I could follow Him.‚Äù While she was working as a cook she used to write the bible verses on the cemented floor with the help of coal and tried to memorize the bible verses. In this way she had memorized the Gospel of Matthew and Mark. In August 8, 1943 she was baptized. She was baptized in the Union Baptist Church, Patna. After her baptism she went for Bible training in Shapur for a year and later went for a nursing training at BMS Hospital in Bhiwani. Two years later, she passed from her nursing training and was certified to work. She worked in the hospital in Jasidhi and also trained people on bible knowledge. Nepalese Army She became seriously ill and had TB along with high fever which doctors were unable to bring down. So later, she was sent to Almora a high country place for two years but still her fever persisted. In those days she was able to get the news letter from Nepal which made her familiar about the condition in Nepal. She remembered her country by that time because her ups and downs in her life and busy with her workloads and enjoying the luxury of India she had almost forgotten about her own country. Later she made a vow with God that if she is healed from her sickness than she will go to Nepal and miraculously from the very next day her fever was gone. So she made up her mind to go to Nepal and to serve the Lord there. Her decision made some of her fellow worker and friend to think that she went out of her mind. Though her seniors and friend had tried to stop her and gave some better options and opportunity for her but she had a very strong determination to go Nepal and work for the Lord which she did. In the year of 1953, she came to Pokhara and worked in the NEB dispensary (later INF) as a nurse and later in 1955; she worked in United Mission to Nepal (UMN) for five years. After 18 years of mission services in India and Nepal she moved to a new challenge as a Matron of the Military Hospital. In this way she also became the first Nepali woman to join in an army and also to achieve the rank of Captain. She was also up for the promotion to Major in 1970/71 but she declined it because for it she needed to participate in Hindu Puja ceremonies which was against her own will. She had a priority toward God than other. Roles in the Christianity of Nepal Gyani Shah was very active in her all works, it might be her secular professions or in her work in helping in the church growth. She was actively leading many people in Christianity in Nepal and helping in the church planting mission too. She was in the member of the first committee for the ‚ÄúDilli Bazaar Fellowship‚Äù, she, Elizabeth Franklin and some missionaries from darjeeling (a missionary with Regions Beyond Missionary Union) were the founding-member of Gyaneshwor Church in the mid-1950s. She also helped to lay the foundation stone for the first church building in Kathmandu, at Putali Sadak. She also opened a branch church of Gyaneshwor in her house in Sanepa. Social works and other contributions She was always used to be active for the evangelism and mission work. One day she felt that the need of evangelism in the remote places of Nepal too. She felt that in the city there were many people to work for the Gospel but in the remote area there were nobody. So she made up her mind to go in the remote place in Tikapur, Kailali which was in the western part of Nepal. At that time there was no connection of roads and there was no electricity and other services. When she shared about it in her office and to her relatives they thought that she went crazy again but God had worked in her to go to those places. And her relatives from royal palace allowed her to go and also provided some medical supplies to have a medical camp. The medical supplies were finally provided by Jay Narayan Giri, Head of Red Cross Nepal during the time. During that time, people of Tikapur were suffering from Cholera epidemic, and TB. In that time she had vaccinated 30000 people in a year. Other contributions and final days Gyani Shah lived her life fully by committing it to the Lord by serving Christ in different places and through different ways. She was not only focused to do the missionary works but she also established a school which was named after her ‚ÄúGyani Shah Sishu Pathsala‚Äù. She also helped in planting a church which now has several daughter churches and is affiliated with Agape Fellowship. She slept in God in the afternoon of 8 December 2012, but she had left a legacy behind her. In her life she had really helped, encouraged and challenged many people. She was very strong willed, with strong determination and with a heart for her people. She had really challenged the women of Nepal that they can also work and contribute in the work of God. She had set her life as an example for many women and also men for the work of God and in mission.

In this third evolution you're going to see a really self possessed, really scary and driven version of the Ivy character, who is intent on kind of making the world in the image she sees it should be, which is the green world. The world where the plants rule and people are an after thought.\\" Robin Lord Taylor, Crystal Reed, and Alexander Siddig don't appear in the episode as their respective characters.

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.1 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"While Gotham hasn't been away all that long, 'Pieces of a Broken Mirror' still felt like an underwhelming adventure for a return episode. It was also very busy and semi-scattered, juggling a Jim/Lee story, a new Ivy transformation, and a sort of off-putting Alfred arc. The best part was Edward realizing that he himself had tried to kill Lee (oh, and the Siren's Club commercial - duh).\\" Kyle Fowle of The A.V. Club gave the episode an \\"A\\" rating and wrote \\"I'll admit to being hesitant heading into this week's spring premiere. After all, the winter finale aired all the way back in the beginning of December, and that kind of lengthy break had me questioning whether the show making its return would be as good as I remembered. Perhaps the first 11 episodes worked only as a contained arc, and the show would struggle to keep that momentum going. Luckily, 'A Dark Knight: Pieces Of A Broken Mirror' is a strong premiere, one that follows through on the storylines from last fall in interesting ways while also pushing the story, and the characters, in a new direction.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the episode a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"Gotham has plenty of compelling elements in the back half of this season, but it desperately needs a few course corrections. But, Gotham is at its absolute best when it steps on the gas, so the upcoming villain team up has me hopeful as ever that the show will erase some of the lagging bits in favor of some crazy action.\\" Lisa Babick of TV Fanatic gave the series a 4.5 star rating out of 5, writing \\"A number of stories unfolded on Gotham, as we caught up with almost everyone including someone we haven't seen in a long, long time. Some of it made sense, some of it not, but considering how much was actually unpacked, Gotham did a good job of not making the hour a cramped mess.\\" Marc Buxton of Den of Geek gave wrote, \\"As with the rest of the developing dynamics in this episode, I hope Gotham chooses the slow burn rather than the immediate plot twist with this one. There was a measuredness to this episode in general that really worked. I'd like to see it continue.\\" References  External links  Gotham (season 4) episodes 2018 American television episodes ","title":"Pieces of a Broken Mirror"},{"id":"56004229","text":"Ushakovsky Bridge ( \\" Ushakov's Bridge\\") (previously known as Stroganovsky Bridge ( \\"Stroganov's Bridge\\")) is a bridge spanning the Bolshaya Nevka River in Saint Petersburg, Russia named for Admiral Fyodor Ushakov.
