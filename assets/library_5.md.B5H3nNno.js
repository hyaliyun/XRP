Biography Born in Tel Aviv during the Mandate era, Eitan took legal studies at Tel Aviv University. He joined the Herut party, and was a chairman of its youth guard, before becoming a member of the party's central committee and chairman of its Ramat Gan branch. He was elected to the Knesset on the Likud list (within which Herut was a faction until 1988) in 1984, and was re-elected in 1988, 1992 and 1996, becoming coalition chairman after the latter election, having been co- ordinator of the opposition between 1992 and 1996. In July 1997 he was appointed Minister of Science & Technology, but was replaced by Silvan Shalom in July the following year.

During the Knesset term he chaired its sub-committee on communication and information and helped establish the Knesset's website. Although he retained his seat in the 1999 elections, they were won by the Labor Party-led One Israel alliance and Eitan lost his place in the cabinet. He was re-elected in 2003, 2006 and 2009, after which he briefly served as temporary Knesset speaker due to him being the longest- serving MK alongside Binyamin Ben-Eliezer.18th Knesset will be sworn-in today The Jerusalem Post, 23 Feb 2009, Retrieved 9 September 2011 He was later appointed Minister of Improvement of Government Services.

The school is part of the Lowndes school system, which serves Lowndes County except for the city of Valdosta. History In 1957, voters in Lowndes County approved an $800,000 bond issue and the board got assistance from the State of Georgia for the construction of a new high school. Lowndes County High School opened in 1959 in the southern portion of the county below Valdosta, serving a totally white enrollment of 671 students. In 1961 students from the local black high schools, Lowndes County Training School and Webb- Miller, were integrated into Westside High School. In 1966 LCHS and Hahira High School consolidated to form the new Lowndes High School (LHS) and began with an enrollment of 805. The new school was relocated to its present facility on Norman Drive near I-75 on the western side of Lowndes County. The former facility became Lowndes Middle School. In 1969, when the county integrated their schools, the former black school, Westside High, was also combined into Lowndes. LHS became a comprehensive high school in 1972 and was classified as a Georgia School of Excellence in 1980. LHS is now one of the largest high schools in the state of Georgia, with a student enrollment of over 3000 students and 170 faculty members.Irwin, Ron. \\"Our Noble Quest: Three Centuries of Educational Excellence, the History of Lowndes County Schools\\". 2009.

The project was funded through SPLOST II. The gym was designed by Manley Spangler Smith Architects. In 2007 a new main road entrance to the school was opened on Norman Drive, along with a new front parking lot and office entrance. The old entrance on St. Augustine Road was closed due to congestion but is still used for large events. JCI Construction of Moultrie built the gym and Rountree Construction of Valdosta built the new entrance, new parking lot, and portico. In the summer of 2019, construction will start with the demolition of several buildings and replacing them on the schools existing footprint. After construction is completed, there will be a new Performing Arts Center, and more classrooms.

K. Simmons, Clifton Collins, Jr., and Dustin Milligan. Said to be Judge's companion piece to Office Space, the film received generally positive reviews and grossed $10.8 million worldwide against a budget of $8 million. The film was theatrically released in the United States on September 4, 2009, to generally positive reviews from critics. Plot Joel Reynolds is the owner and founder of Reynolds Extract, a flavoring-extracts company. Although his business is successful, his marriage lacks passion. He is also often accosted by his annoying neighbor, Nathan. One day, a series of mishaps occur at the extract factory, resulting in an employee, Step, losing a testicle. Cindy, a con artist, reads a news story about the accident. Hatching a get-rich-quick scheme, she gets a temporary job at the factory, manipulating Joel into giving her more information about Step. She also begins a series of petty thefts from her co- workers, who openly accuse each other of the thefts. Although Step initially decides not to sue the company, he changes his mind after a meeting with Cindy, which she sets up in order to meet and flirt with him. Under Cindy's influence, Step hires attorney Joe Adler. Joel, mistaking Cindy's manipulations for genuine attraction to him, entertains the idea of an affair with her; however, he still loves his wife, and wants to avoid actions that would leave him with regrets later. While visiting his friend Dean and complaining about his situation, Dean suggests that Joel hire a gigolo to seduce his wife, so that Joel can then have a guilt-free \\"revenge\\" affair. Joel initially balks at the idea; but, after his judgment is impaired after ingesting a ketamine tablet that Dean mistakenly told him was Xanax, Joel agrees. The friends hire Brad to seduce his wife, Suzie, into an affair, while posing as the pool cleaner. The next morning, Joel sobers up, realizes what he has done, and tries to stop Brad from going to his house; by then, Brad and Suzie have already begun an affair. Brad falls in love with Suzie and wants to run away with her. After smoking marijuana with Dean and his friend Willie, Joel attempts to call Cindy, but soon realizes that he is calling Willie's number. Just then, Cindy walks into the apartment. Willie realizes that Joel is trying to get with Cindy, and punches Joel in the face. Joel meets with Adler and his associates to discuss the terms of the settlement for Step. The workers, believing that the meeting is about a buy-out of the factory by General Mills, organize a strike. Frustrated by Adler's uncompromising negotiating style and the growing disrespect from his employees, Joel storms out and goes home‚Äîwhere Suzie admits her affair with Brad. Joel admits to Suzie that he hired Brad to do it, then leaves after arguing with his wife. Joel moves into a motel, where he spots Cindy, staying in another room. When he goes to her room, he notices a purse stolen from one of his employees, along with other stolen items, and realizes that Cindy is not only a thief, but is also behind many of the company's problems. Joel threatens to call the police, but softens when Cindy breaks down in tears. Cindy promises to talk to Step and get him to drop the lawsuit. Ultimately, the two spend the night together. The next morning, Cindy disappears, but leaves the stolen items behind. Step meets with Joel at the factory, where he offers to drop the lawsuit if Joel promotes him to floor manager. Meanwhile, Nathan stops by Joel's house, making Suzie lose her temper and finally tell him what she really thinks of him. Just as she finishes her tirade, he collapses and dies; feeling guilty, Suzie attends the funeral, where she runs into Joel. After an awkward moment, the two agree to share a ride. It is revealed that Cindy has stolen Adler's luxury car, leaving him Step's truck in its place.

But years later, by the time of the film's release, audiences had decided that Office Space had struck a chord, and they were ready to see Judge return to on-the-job humor and thus the Extract script was given new life. Seeking to keep Extract below the radar of the studio system, Judge and his producers set up a production company, Ternion Productions, and arranged private financing‚Äîwhile partnering with Miramax for domestic distribution of the film. Judge relied heavily on his own personal knowledge of the industrial world to bring the story to life. \\"I actually worked in a factory a little bit myself,\\" the director stated. \\"I hopefully write stuff that is recognizable as the archetypes of this world.\\" Keeping true to this baseline of reality, \\"Extract\\" was shot in a working factory, in this case a water bottling plant south of Los Angeles, in the City of Commerce. Judge took the authenticity one step further by using the plant's employees as extras in the scenes' backgrounds. \\"Those people were actually running, doing some bottling while we were shooting. There were people working on machines that were so loud in there they couldn‚Äôt hear anyone call 'action' or 'cut.' They were just doing their job.\\" Shooting on the factory set led Judge to some epiphanies about what made the story resonate for him: \\"Office Space was told from the point of view of the employees looking up at management as the 'bad guys'. This is told from the point of view of the owner of the place and the workers are the big pain in the butt to him. I think partly it was inspired by that point in my life where I suddenly had a large number of people working for me and realizing you can‚Äôt be a 'cool guy boss'. It just doesn‚Äôt work. So this is my more sympathetic take on the boss.\\" Release Marketing Leading up to the film's release, Affleck went on a promotional tour of various cities, starting in Vancouver, Washington, on August 20, 2009, and ending in Los Angeles on September 14, 2009. In an effort to promote the film, Judge released a promotional short which featured his characters Beavis and Butt- head who summarize, and critique, the events depicted in the film. Home media Extract was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on December 22, 2009. Reception Box office Extract made $4.3 million during its opening weekend and $7.1 million in its first week of release, with a total worldwide gross of 10.8 million, against a production budget of $8 million. Critical response On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 62% based on 187 reviews, with an average rating of 5.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Extract has some very funny moments and several fine performances, but the film feels slighter and more uneven than Mike Judge's previous work.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on 33 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Dan Zak of The Washington Post, called it \\"the most disappointing American comedy of the decade\\". On the other end of the spectrum, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called it \\"the funniest American comedy of the summer\\".

Background He was born in Dungannon, County Tyrone, eldest son of William Dowse and Maria Donaldson.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. 2 p. 369 He was educated at the Royal School Dungannon and the University of Dublin. He entered Lincoln's Inn in 1849 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1852. After practicing for some years on the North-Western Circuit, he became Queen's Counsel in 1863 and Third Serjeant in 1867.Ball p. 369 Later career He was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Londonderry City at the 1868 general election. He was appointed a Baron of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland) in 1872, having served briefly as Attorney- General and Solicitor-General for Ireland Dowse resided at 38 Mountjoy Square in Dublin's north city centre. He died suddenly while holding the assizes in Tralee, County Kerry in March 1890. Family On 29 December 1852, he married Catherine, daughter of George Moore of Clones. She died in 1874. Reputation He was considered one of the finest and wittiest Parliamentary speakers of the age,Delaney, V.T.H Christopher Palles Allen Figgis and Co 1960 p.90 and had the ability to crush an opposing speaker. When John Thomas Ball, a future Lord Chancellor of Ireland, asked for the date of a certain event, Dowse replied gravely that he did not have the precise date, but he thought it was about the time when Ball changed his political allegiance in the hope of getting into the House of Commons.Delaney p.41 By comparison with his political speeches, his judgements are generally rather dull, and have little value as precedents. He never had much reputation as a lawyer, although he had the virtues of common sense, clarity and simplicity. Delaney refers to a complex habeas corpus application which Dowse disposed of by saying simply \\"I'm afraid the prisoner must remain in gaol,Delaney p.91 and he occasionally showed a touch of his celebrated wit in his judgements. Maurice Healy tells the story of a later judge who refused to follow a judgement of Dowse's, saying unkindly that \\"the learned Baron was always better known for his wit than his law\\". Counsel then embarrassed the judge by pointing out that the House of Lords had given an identical judgment.Healy, Maurice The Old Munster Circuit Michael Joseph Ltd. 1939 Mercier Press reprint pp.121-2 Legacy His obituary notice in The Times of 15 March 1890, read On his retirement from the House of Commons, Punch magazine published a warm tribute to a man whose humour had been \\"like an oasis in the desert\\".Delaney p.90 Elrington Ball described him as a man who combined great wit with incisive intelligence and a knowledge of the world.Ball p.305 References External links Irish Criminology * Archiseek Dublin Tour * - 1824 births 1890 deaths Irish barristers Solicitors-General for Ireland Attorneys-General for Ireland Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Londonderry constituencies (1801‚Äì1922) UK MPs 1868‚Äì1874 Irish Liberal Party MPs Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Judges of the High Court of Justice in Ireland Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) ","title":"Richard Dowse"},{"id":"19221154","text":"Windward High School is the newest of two public high schools of the Ferndale School District (district 502), in Bellingham, Washington.

El Tintal is a Maya archaeological site in the northern Pet√©n region of Guatemala, about northeast of the modern-day settlement of Carmelita, with settlement dating to the Preclassic and Classic periods.Hansen et al 2006, p.739. It is close to the better known sites of El Mirador ( to the north), to which it was linked by causeway, and Nakb√© ( to the northeast).Demarest 1984, pp.14-32. El Tintal is a sizeable site that includes some very large structures and it is one of the four largest sites in the northern Pet√©n;Hansen 1998, p.54. CONAP:Plan Maestro Parque Nacional Mirador- R√≠o Azul, p.16. Hansen 1993, p.100. it is the second largest site in the Mirador Basin, after El Mirador itself.Estrada Belli 2011, p.50. El Tintal features monumental architecture dating to the Middle Preclassic similar to that found at El Mirador, Nakb√© and Wakna.Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.214. Potsherds recovered from the site date to the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods, and construction continued at the site in the Late Classic period.Hansen 1992, p.22. The causeway system linking the sites of El Tintal, El Mirador and Nakb√© involved a significant labour investment and an enormous quantity of construction materials, indicating an accomplished engineering programme in the Preclassic Period.Hansen 1998, p.75. Although the site's existence was known to archaeologists for decades, due to its remote location no thorough investigation of the site took place until 2004, when the Mirador Basin Project carried out the first systematic excavations.Hansen et al 2006, p.740. Location El Tintal is located in the north of the department of Pet√©n, in a remote area still covered by dense virgin rainforest and only accessible by mule trails. The site occupies a hill, with four swampy areas within the site core. The swamps of the Mirador Basin appear to have been the primary attraction for the first inhabitants of the area as evidenced by the unusual cluster of large cities clustered around them.Hansen 1992, p.1. Hansen et al 2006, p.740. Occupation Ceramic analysis has revealed that El Tintal was most heavily occupied during the Late Preclassic (300 BC - AD 150) and in the Late Classic. Preclassic ceramic finds are of a type found throughout the Mirador Basin, but Late Classic ceramics are of a type distinct from those found at other sites in the basin, suggesting cultural diversion as population levels fell after the Preclassic.Hansen et al 2006, pp.741, 743. Modern history El Tintal was first visited by Heinrich Berlin in the 1950s but it was not until 1970 that test pits were excavated by archaeologists Ian Graham and Joyce Marcus, of the universities of Harvard and Michigan respectively. In 1990 Richard D. Hansen carried out a rescue excavation around Stela 1. The Mirador Basin Project carried out the first systematic excavations at the site in 2004.Hansen et al 2006, pp.740-741. The site has been heavily looted, with 2154 looters' trenches cut into the mapped structures, averaging 2.54 trenches per structure. The looters unearthed thousands of burials and have left human remains, ceramics and other artifacts judged of lesser value scattered throughout the site. A great deal of damage was done by looters mistakenly looking for Classic Period burials in Preclassic structures, resulting in extensive digging when such burials were not found.Hansen et al 2006, p.743. The site The Mirador Basin Project mapped around the monumental architecture of El Tintal, recording 850 major structures reaching up to high. Wide causeways connected various parts of the site, as well as connecting the city with a network of other sites in the Mirador Basin.Hansen et al 2006, p.741. Two of the largest buildings at El Tintal are triadic structures, a Preclassic Maya innovation consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform.Hansen 1998, pp.77-78, 80. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.253. These triadic structures have been heavily looted.Hansen 1998, p.89. These extensive looters trenches have failed to locate any tombs or burials. One of the largest pyramids in the site core is a triadic pyramid estimated to have a height of with a massive base measuring . The site was investigated in 1990 under the direction of archaeologist Richard D. Hansen of the University of California, Los Angeles.Hansen 1992, p.1. The investigations consisted of the rescue excavation of one of the many looters' trenches at the site, the excavated trench having been cut through a mound upon the triadic pyramid. The looters' trench had revealed a broken red sandstone stela (Stela 1), which was first reported in 1979 to archaeologists of the El Mirador Project. The remains of the stela were resting upon a stucco floor, a large shell was found nearby surrounded by pieces of jade.Hansen 1992, p.22, 27. A ballcourt is located north of the triadic pyramid near the centre of the site and is the largest ballcourt yet found in the Maya lowlands.Hansen et al 2006, pp.739, 741. A jade plaque has been recovered from El Tintal bearing a design very similar to a design from an ear-spool from the nearby Classic Period site of La Muerta.Suyuc et al 2005, p.11. Mano de Le√≥n complex This complex consists of the civic centre of the city. It is completely surrounded by wide, deep ditch with an average width of , measuring up to deep and with a total length of . Due to the presence of Preclassic residential structures along the edge of the ditch, the ditch is believed to date from that period. The ditch was likely to have been defensive in nature although it is possible that it had other functions, such as supplying water or providing a social or political boundary within the city.Hansen et al 2006, p.742. The Mano de Le√≥n Complex is the most heavily looted area of the city, with 945 looters' trenches mapped by the Mirador Basin Project. An important find in a heavily looted area to the southwest of the complex was that of a painted ceramic vessel in a modified Codex style and dating to around AD 700-750, in the Late Classic. It bears depictions of the Maya Maize God and painted hieroglyphs stating that it was a drinking vessel belonging to Yopaat B'ahlam, an important lord who is named in a variety of texts from Late Classic sites in the Mirador Basin. =Stela 1= El Tintal Stela 1 was carved from red sandstone, it was found buried within a structure near the northwest corner of the El Pavo pyramid in the Mano de Le√≥n complex. The stela stood in the plaza for centuries after being carved. Stela 1 was recarved sometime before the Early Classic Period, with elements of the earlier design surviving on the butt of the monument.Justeson & Mathews 1983, p.587. The preserved designs on the butt include hundreds of carved lines and symbols forming graffiti in a style typical of Preclassic imagery in the region.Hansen et al 2006, p.745. The stela was deliberately mutilated during the Late Classic, the surviving parts of Stela 1 depict two feet in profile above a band containing other elements.Hansen 1991, p.174. Hansen 1992, p.25. The stela measures high, wide and thick. It is judged to predate Tikal Stela 29 on stylistic grounds,Hammond 1982, p.396. Hansen 1992, p.25. the latter bears a Maya Long Count date equivalent to a date in AD 292.Tikal at the Metropolitan Museum of Art El Tintal Stela 1 was associated with a circular limestone altar that had been displaced by the looters.

History Crossroads Christian Church was founded in 1892 by nine members in Corona, California. Led by Reverend Wright and Sister Iola, the church opened as \\"First Christian Church of South Riverside.\\" In 1932, the church changed its name to \\"1st Christian Church, Corona\\"; at the time, it had 100 members. The current name was put in place in 1980. Chuck Booher is currently the senior pastor. Crossroads Christian Church is a megachurch with a congregation of more than 8,000 people. Crossroads Christian Church has been cited by the Christian media as being in the top five of all US churches for having the most baptisms in one year and the largest Easter Service attendance. In 2003, Crossroads opened its first full service cafe called Third Place Cafe. In 2005, a 3,000-seat worship center and chapel was opened. To celebrate the opening of the worship center several concerts were presented featuring artists such as Olivia Newton-John, SHeDAISY, Delirious?, Jeremy Camp, Michael W. Smith, Lonestar, Casting Crowns, Phil Vassar and Third Day. Third Place Cafe was retired in 2013 and the space has been converted into a coffee shop named \\"Restoration Roasters.\\" It is run by the Orange County Rescue Mission. General Crossroads Christian Church is situated on a campus. The church has different ministries available to attendees as well as online audio and video sermons and a separate Spanish language ministry. Restoration Roasters Restoration Roasters is a full service cafe located on the Crossroads Christian Church campus. Beliefs Crossroads Christian Church bases its teachings on this belief that the entire Bible is inspired by God. The church also holds in account the belief in the Trinity, as well as the recognition of the death of Christ on the cross and resurrection. From the commands found in the Bible, the church practices the following: * Salvation: Each service offers an Altar call at the end in order for people to accept Christ as Lord and Savior. * Water baptism: We Believe faith in Jesus requires repentance, confession of that faith before witnesses, and obedience to His Word. Baptism by immersion demonstrates our faith and obedience while it depicts our union with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection. Baptism is practiced every service as needed in the main worship center. Two to three times a year there is a baptism service in which people come in their clothes to pools around the stage to be baptized. * Communion: The church believes the Bible asks for this act of remembering what Jesus did on the cross. It is offered during every service. * Growing Relationship with Jesus Christ: Crossroads Church believes that every believer should be in a growing relationship with Jesus by obeying God's Word, yielding to the Holy Spirit and by being conformed to the image of Christ.

She has won 14 Group One races, with nine victories over colts and geldings. This puts her above Miesque as the only European-trained horse to have won more than 10 Group I races since their introduction in the 1970s. Goldikova is the only horse to win three (2008, 2009, 2010) Breeders' Cup Mile races. She was ridden by Olivier Peslier in all of her race starts. Background Goldikova was bred by Alain and G√©rard Wertheimer and sired by July Cup winner Anabaa. Her dam, Born Gold, is also the dam of Prix Vermeille winner Galikova, who was sired by champion sire Galileo. Goldikova was put into training with Freddy Head, former six-times Champion Jockey in France. Racing career 2007: two-year-old season Goldikova won both of her starts at age two, capturing the Prix de Toutevoie and the Prix de la Lorie at Chantilly Racecourse. 2008: three-year-old season At age three, Goldikova began the 2008 season in April, running monthly thereafter. She started with two seconds and a third and loss to Zarkava (in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches and the Prix de Diane), then had three consecutive wins. The first one came in the Prix Chlo√©, followed by the Prix Rothschild, in which she defeated both the French Classic winner, Darjina, and the British Classic winner, Natagora. Goldikova winning the Breeders' Cup Mile Goldikova's third straight victory of the year came in September at Longchamp Racecourse in the Group 1 Prix du Moulin in which she defeated Darjina and Natagora again as well as top Irish colt Henrythenavigator. She again defeated the males in winning the 2008 Breeders' Cup Mile at Santa Anita Park in California and was a finalist for the Eclipse Award's American Champion Female Turf Horse for 2008. 2009: four-year-old season Goldikova (#11) at the start of the 2009 Mile Racing at age four, Goldikova made her first start in May's Prix d'Ispahan, finishing seventh on a soft course. In July, she won England's Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse. On 2 August, she won her second consecutive Prix Rothschild at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. At the same Deauville course on 16 August, Goldikova won her sixth group one race, easily defeating her male counterparts in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville-La Touques Racecourse. Goldikova then returned to Santa Anita Park to win her second Breeders' Cup Mile, with a different racing style. She was second last for much of the race and at the top of the stretch went five horses wide. Then she changed leads again and surged past Courageous Cat to win in 1:32.26. 2010: five-year-old season Racing silks of the Wertheimer family Following her 2009 Breeders' Cup win at Santa Anita Park, Goldikova was rested at the Head family's Haras du Quesnay in Normandy until mid February, when she was put back in training at Freddy Head's base at Chantilly Racecourse. On 23 May, she won her 2010 debut at Longchamp in the Prix d'Ispahan, completing the in 1:49.4 while holding off Byword (who subsequently won the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot) and setting a new stakes record in the process. In her second start of 2010, on 15 June, Goldikova won the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, defeating the 2009 winner Paco Boy by a neck in 1:37.74, taking 0.5 seconds off of the stakes record. It was her ninth group 1 victory, and sixth victory against males. On 1 August, Goldikova competed a three-peat of wins in the Prix Rothschild. After she settled in third throughout the race, Oliver Peslier barely had to ask an effort of her before she raced away from the rest of the field. On 15 August in the Prix Jacques Le Marois, two weeks after the Prix Rothschild win, Goldikova suffered her first defeat of the year, second to Makfi. Her connections believed that it was largely because of the very soft ground, which she has shown her extreme dislike for in the past. However, she beat Paco Boy again for the second time. On 3 October, Goldikova made her final start before the Breeders' Cup Mile, defeating a field of 16 males in the Prix de la For√™t at Longchamp, including Dick Turpin, Paco Boy, and 1,000 Guineas winner Special Duty. By winning, she broke the record set by Miesque for the most Group/Grade I wins ever by a European mare. She made history on 6 November 2010 when she became the first horse to win a Breeders' Cup race three times by winning the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs, defeating Champion Turf Horse Gio Ponti by 1 3/4 lengths. On 16 November Goldikova was awarded with two Cartier Racing Awards, Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse. She became the only horse to win the Champion Older Horse award twice. 2011: six-year-old season Goldikova in the pre-race paddock Goldikova made her six-year-old debut on 22 May by winning the Prix d'Ispahan for the second time, beating Champion Stakes winner Cirrus des Aigles.https://www.espn.co.uk/horse-racing/news/story?id=6575775 On 14 June Goldikova finished second by ¬æ length to Canford Cliffs in the Queen Anne Stakes. Jockey Olivier Peslier was fined for being two pounds overweight when he weighed in. Goldikova won her 14th Group/Grade 1, a European record, when winning her fourth consecutive Prix Rothschild at Deauville. On 15 August, Goldikova attempted to extend her record of Group/Grade I wins to 15 in the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville, France. She did not take to the soft ground, which was the case for this year's Prix Jacques Le Marois. Goldikova ran second, beaten a length, to Group I winner Immortal Verse. Goldikova prepped for the Breeders' Cup Mile in the Group 1 Prix de la For√™t on the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe undercard at Longchamp. She was beaten a head by five time Group 1 winner Dream Ahead. This was Goldikova's final race in France before she headed to her career finale in the USA. On November 4, 2011, Goldikova finished third in the Breeders' Cup Mile, one length behind longshot Court Vision, who edged out Turallure by a nose. Goldikova was attempting to win an unprecedented fourth straight Breeders' Cup Mile. The final time was 1:37.05 over good ground. Assessment and Honours Goldikova was officially rated the joint 6th best horse in the world in 2008 on a rating of 125. The only filly rated higher than her was Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Zarkava. In 2009, with a rating of 130, she was rated the second best horse in the world, behind only 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Sea the Stars. Goldikova achieved a rating of 125 in 2010, the joint 11th best in the world and the top rated mare. At the end of the 2011 season she was officially rated as the joint 14th best horse in the world and the 3rd best filly or mare on a rating of 124. In 2017, Goldikova was inducted into the American Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.  Retirement  Goldikova was retired from racing immediately after her third-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Mile. In early 2012, she was covered by champion sire Galileo at Coolmore Stud in Ireland. On Sunday 3 February 2013, Goldikova gave birth to her first foal, a colt.

Ziebach (also known by his full name of Francis Marion Ziebach) was a noted political figure in the Dakota Territory during the territorial period from 1861 to 1889. He was a pioneer newspaperman, founding a number of newspapers in the Iowa and Dakota Territories, including the Yankton \\"Weekly Dakotan\\" (also referred to as the \\"Weekly Dakotian\\") in 1861, which is still published today as the Yankton \\"Press and Dakotan\\". He was known as the \\"squatter governor\\" of the Dakota Territory. Ziebach County, South Dakota was created in 1911, and is named for him. Frank M. Ziebach was born in 1830 in Pennsylvania, and died in 1929 in Yankton, South Dakota at the age of 98. His life spanned the period from the presidency of Andrew Jackson to that of Herbert Hoover. Early life, marriage and children Frank M. Ziebach was born On November 23, 1830 in Union County, Pennsylvania, near Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. When a boy he entered the printer's trade. In 1853 he went to Madison, Wisconsin, but in 1855 returned home and founded the \\"Lewisburg Argus\\". He married Elizabeth Fisher, of Danville, Pa, and over the course of their married life they had four sons and two daughters. Iowa 1856 to 1862 Frank M. Ziebach moved from Pennsylvania to Iowa and in August 1856 he began publication of the \\"Western Independent\\" with J. N. Cummings in Sargeants Bluff, eight miles south of Sioux City, Iowa. In 1858 Frank bought out his partner, and moved the equipment to Sioux City, where he commenced publication on July 22, 1858, as the weekly \\"Sioux City Register\\". The \\"Register\\" declared itself to be a \\"Democratic\\" newspaper. In 1859, Frank sold an interest to William Freney and the \\"Register\\" was consolidated with the \\"Sioux City Eagle\\". The partnership of Ziebach and Freney continued to publish the \\"Register\\" until 1862, but in 1861 Frank transferred his interests to Yankton, South Dakota. The Yankton Weekly Dakotian newspaper In 1861, Frank M. Ziebach freighted his printing outfit from Sioux City, Iowa to Yankton by team and wagon. He and his partner from Sioux City, William Freney, formed the Dakotian Printing Company in Yankton, and printed the first edition of the \\"Weekly Dakotian\\" at Yankton on June 6, 1861. Frank Ziebach was the editor and did a good portion of the practical work besides. He was a master printer and a good journalist. The papers Ziebach had formed in Iowa were self-proclaimed Democrat newspapers and in early editions the Yankton Weekly Dakotian similarly proclaimed itself to be a \\"Douglas Democrat\\" newspaper. However, after the elections brought the Republicans to power in the territorial legislature in the fall of 1861, the newspaper switched sides. The newspaper became inactive for a short period, during which Ziebach sold the newspaper to J.C. Trask in March 1862. The Dakotian now re-emerged and declared itself a Republican newspaper, and the Dakotian Printing Company was rewarded by becoming the first \\"Public Printer\\" in Dakota, doing the printing for the first Legislative Assembly. After the first legislative session the Dakotian was sold to George W. Kingsbury, and Frank M. Zieback subsequently rejoined the newspaper as a partner of Kingsbury. Since the Dakotian had been a declared Democrat newspaper when published by Frank Ziebach in 1861, but now had switched its allegiance to the Republicans in 1862, when Ziebach rejoined Kingsbury in the newspaper business \\"political party prudence\\" dictated that Ziebach be a silent partner and Kingsbury, a Republican, be the official editor and manager of the paper. These political machinations had their reward, and during the second session of the territorial legislature Ziebach and Kingsbury retained the position of \\"Public Printer\\". After 1863, the paper passed into the sole possession of Kingsbury. Yankton was the territorial capitol of the Dakota Territory from 1861 until 1883 (when the capitol was moved to Bismarck) and during this period the Dakotian grew swiftly with its reporting of the early political wars of Dakota Territory. The paper passed through a number of different ownership entities, and in the following decades other area newspapers become consolidated with the Dakotian so that it eventually became known as the Press and Dakotan and is still published under that name today in Yankton, South Dakota. There is a debate about the \\"first newspaper\\" in the Dakota Territory. On March 2, 1861, Congress passed the Organic Act that brought the Dakota Territory into being, with Yankton as its capitol. The Weekly Dakotian was the first newspaper that was published in the Dakota Territory after the passage of the organic act. However it was the second newspaper in the area that became South Dakota. The first newspaper in what is now South Dakota was the Dakota Democrat published in Sioux Falls for about four years starting in 1858. The Yankton Dakota Militia in the 1862 Indian uprising In August 1862 raiding Sioux killed Judge Amedon and his son near Sioux Falls, and shortly thereafter Yankton got news of the massacre in Minnesota by Little Crow. Settlers panicked and came pouring into Yankton with their goods and livestock. A sod stockade was thrown up around the printing offices of the Dakotian. The stockaded newspaper building became known as \\"Fort Yankton\\". The governor called for militia volunteers, and four hundred citizens responded. Frank M. Ziebach was elected Captain of Company A of the Dakota Militia, and George W. Kingsbury, the co-editor at the Dakotian became the company orderly sergeant. Frank M. Ziebach became known by the tongue in cheek title of Commander in Chief of the Army at Fort Yankton. Although for Yankton there was almost no fighting (excepting a short clash in the late fall on the outskirts of Sioux Falls), historical memory now recalls dashing images from \\"the exciting and perilous weeks of the Indian outbreak of 1862, when Yankton was besieged.\\" Public offices in Iowa and the Dakota Territory, 1868 to 1889 Frank M. Ziebach went to Dubuque Iowa in 1863 and purchased an interest in the Dubuque Herald. He returned to Sioux City, Iowa in 1868 and in the fall of that year was appointed register of the United States land office at Sioux City. He was mayor of Sioux City for two terms 1868‚Äì69 and 1869‚Äì70. He returned to Yankton in 1870, where he again became engaged in the newspaper business. In 1873, he was elected to the office as Superintendent of Schools, but since he did not qualify, another was appointed to fill his place. He was elected mayor of Yankton serving for three terms from 1876 through 1880. He served as a member of the territorial legislature 1877‚Äì78 and 1883‚Äì84. When in the 1877‚Äì78 territorial legislature, Mr. Ziebach resided in Yankton, and represented Yankton County. When he was in the 1883‚Äì84 territorial legislature he resided in Scotland and represented Bon Homme County. He was a delegate to the South Dakota state constitutional convention, in 1883. He served as a member of first Yankton's Board of Education, formed in 1875. He has also held other minor offices in city and territorial government. From 1861 to 1889, Dakota Territory elected a single non-voting Territorial Delegate for a two- year term to the United States House of Representatives. Each party held bi- annual conventions to nominate their candidate for the office. Frank M. Ziebach attended the Democratic Party Territorial Convention in 1874, and in 1882, serving each time on the influential \\"Committee on Resolutions\\". Though not chosen as the Democratic candidate for territorial delegate to the U.S. Congress, in each convention he was nominated for the position and received a substantial number of votes. The squatter governor Frank M. Ziebach is known to history as the \\"squatter governor\\" of Dakota Territory. During the first territorial legislative session he presided as the mock \\"governor\\" over an informal caucus of territorial leaders who formed a mock legislature. This caucus was known as the \\"third house\\". This incident caused Frank M. Ziebach to be referred to as the \\"squatter governor\\" (a squatter being a frontier term for a person who holds land by possessing it, or \\"squatting\\" on it, without having any formal legal title to the land). The mock legislature sessions continued sporadically in later years, and Frank M. Ziebach was often called to preside. These mock legislature sessions afforded a good deal of entertainment during the formal legislative sessions. Because he had become known as the \\"squatter governor\\" Frank M. Ziebach was popularly referred to as \\"governor\\" throughout the latter half of his life. Candidate for territorial governor, commissioner of U.S. land office, 1886 ‚Äì 1889 When Dakota sought admission as a state, an intense debate arose whether the territory would be admitted as the single state of Dakota, or admitted as two states. Politicians became known as \\"one state\\" advocates, or \\"two state\\" advocates, also called \\"divisionists\\". In 1884 Grover Cleveland, a Democrat was elected President of the United States, and in 1886, it fell to him to appoint a governor for the Dakota Territory. Frank M. Ziebach was the overwhelming choice of 90% of the rank and file Democrats in the territory, and extensive petitions were prepared and sent to the President. Frank M. Ziebach went to Washington, and met all the right people, and the Democratic faithful and the candidate confidently expected that he would be appointed governor. However, Frank M. Ziebach was a \\"two state Democrat\\" with a reputation as a \\"pronounced divisionist\\" and President Cleveland favored a \\"one state\\" admission. In 1886 President Cleveland awarded Frank M. Ziebach the consolation prize of appointment as Commissioner of the U.S. Land Office, and in 1887 the President appointed a \\"one state\\" candidate as governor. Nevertheless, Frank M. Ziebach continued to advocate for a two state admission, and in 1889 the United States Congress resolved the issue by passage of the Enabling Act of 1889 which admitted North Dakota and South Dakota, along with Montana and Washington. Later life, and becoming the namesake for Ziebach County After being appointed Commissioner of the Land Office in 1886, Frank M. Ziebach held that office for a few years, and then continued to hold appointive positions under the federal land office, retiring in 1924.The source, \\"The Annals of Iowa\\" says: \\"About 1872 he returned to Yankton and was a citizen of Dakota Territory, and later of the state of South Dakota, for the remainder of his life, serving in the territorial legislature, and holding several appointive positions under the federal land department, retiring in 1924.\\" There is some reason to doubt the date of retirement, as Mr. Ziebach would be in his mid 90s, a late age even for a dedicated federal employee. In 1911, Frank M. Ziebach was honored when Ziebach county in South Dakota was created and named for him. In 1919 he was elected a \\"Life Member\\" of the South Dakota State Historical Society because, \\"His long residence in the State... (and) his activities on behalf of the growth and development of South Dakota, from earliest territorial days to the present time make him one of the marked figures on the list of our most prominent citizens.\\" Death and burial Frank M. Ziebach died at Wessington Springs, South Dakota on September 20, 1929, at almost 99 years of age. His wife predeceased him, dying at Winner on August 8, 1917. Frank M. Ziebach is buried in the Yankton Cemetery at Yankton, South Dakota. Notes In 1862, Frank M. Ziebach was one of the original founders of the Masonic lodge in Yankton. The Dakota Territory became an organized governmental unit on March 2, 1861. Upon creation, the Dakota Territory included present day North and South Dakota, and much of present-day Montana and Wyoming; by 1868, creation of the new territories of Montana and Wyoming reduced Dakota Territory to the present boundaries of North and South Dakotas. Increasing population caused the Dakota Territory to be divided in half, and a bill for statehood for North Dakota and South Dakota (as well as Montana and Washington) titled the Enabling Act of 1889 was passed on February 22, 1889. On February 1, 1911, Governor Vessey signed the bill creating Ziebach County. However, being the namesake of Ziebach County has become a rather dubious honor, as the county consistently retained the title of \\"poorest county in America\\" for a number of years, and today Ziebach County is the fourth poorest county in the United States. If the Dakota Territory had been admitted as one state in 1889, instead of two states (North and South Dakota), its land area (383,177 km2) would have made it the fourth largest state, after Alaska, Texas and California, just edging out Montana (381,176 km2). Before Frank M. Ziebach became known as the \\"squatter governor\\" of the mock territorial session in 1862, there were other squatter governments. Before the 1861 founding of the Dakota Territory, there were extralegal \\"squatter governments\\" devised by speculators from Dubuque and St. Paul who combined to start a political movement at present-day Sioux Falls and began agitating for the creation of a new Dakota territory. Prior to this time, any new non-slave territory was opposed by the southern members of Congress unless offset by a new slave territory. However, in 1861 the prospect of secession by southern states after the 1860 presidential election removed this obstacle to political change. Lame duck Democrats in Congress and defeated president James Buchanan claimed a final legacy by extending legal authority to create territorial governments. Thus, these early unofficial \\"squatter governments\\" gave a semblance of order, before organized government was formed, and helped provide the impetus to create the Dakota Territory.

He took the 200 m silver at the 1964 Championships, but his greatest haul came at the following year's event, where he finished just behind Lennox Miller for the 100 m silver medal and beat Clifton Bertrand, a two-time champion, to the 200 m gold with a run of 20.8 seconds.British West Indies Championships.

He was part of the Jamaican 4√ó110 yards relay which won the silver medal and he reached the quarter-finals of both the 100-yard dash and 220 yard dash. Following his retirement from athletics, McNeil became a sprinting coach at William Knibb Memorial High School in Trelawny Parish, Jamaica, training youths such as Usain Bolt. McNeil convinced Bolt to give up cricket in favour of track sprinting. He coached the young Jamaican throughout his high school career and their partnership came to an end when Bolt was sent to Kingston to work with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association at the age of 16. He intended to write a book about his time as Bolt's trainer titled The Bolt of Lightning and Me. McNeil suffered a stroke in December 2007 and his vision was from then on impaired.

In 1970, he was voted the Most Valuable Player in the International League while playing for the Rochester Red Wings. His first major league call-up was in September and he made his playing debut on September 18, 1970 starting in right field and batting cleanup, going 0-for-4 in a 5-4 Orioles' loss to the Cleveland Indians.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL197009180.shtml His first hit came two days later, a single off the Indians' Phil Hennigan.https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BAL/BAL197009200.shtml He went 2-for-13 in four games with one RBI. Freed was traded from the Orioles to the Phillies for Grant Jackson, Jim Hutto and Sam Parrilla on December 15, 1970. He was a top prospect whose chances of dislodging Frank Robinson, Paul Blair (baseball), Don Buford or Merv Rettenmund from the Orioles outfield roster were becoming more unlikely.Durso, Joseph. \\"Orioles Obtain Jackson in Trade with Phillies,\\" The New York Times, Thursday, Dec. 17, 1970.

Over the course of the season, however, he slowly saw less and less playing time, and he wound up playing 100 games that season, batting .221. That would be the closest Freed ever came to being a major league regular. Freed spent 1972 coming off the bench as a pinch hitter. Freed did appear in more games in right field for the Phillies than anyone else, but his total was only 45 games as the Phillies rotated Tommy Hutton, Mike Anderson, Oscar Gamble and Bill Robinson through the position as well. Both Freed and Gamble were shipped off to the Cleveland Indians for Del Unser and minor league third baseman Terry Wedgewood on December 1, 1972.Durso, Joseph. \\"A's Send Epstein to Rangers; Scheinblum, Nelson to Reds,\\" The New York Times, Saturday, December 2, 1972.

He played in Mexico for all of 1975, but resurfaced with the Montreal Expos in 1976. Playing for the Denver Bears, he received his second minor league MVP award, this time in the American Association.

Cardinals =.400 (almost)= 1977 proved to be a special year for Freed. Although he played in only 49 games, Freed became a popular player in St. Louis as he came through with a series of clutch pinch hits, and as the end of the season drew near he was in the rarified air of a batting average over .400. On the last day of the season, his average was .402, and he could have sat on the bench that last day and kept his average above the magical mark. However, the Cardinals were down 6‚Äì3 against the New York Mets going in the 9th, and had put a rally together. A double by Mike Tyson, a walk by Mike Anderson, and a single by Mike Phillips had brought the Cardinals to within 6‚Äì4 with one out. The Mets removed pitcher Paul Siebert and replaced him with Rick Baldwin, and Baldwin was able to get Mike Potter to fly out. The Cardinals' pitcher, Al Hrabosky was due up, and Freed was called upon to pinch hit.

Its spectrum of activity is similar to that of ampicillin, although it is less susceptible to beta-lactamases than ampicillin and has much higher bioavailability. A large randomized, double-blind clinical trial published in 1978 also showed that ciclacillin is associated with significantly fewer and milder adverse effects than ampicillin; later studies seemed to confirm this improved tolerability, at least in children. Ciclacillin has been superseded by newer antibiotics and is no longer in clinical use, at least in the United States. Retrieved on September 7, 2008 through Google Book Search. Synthesis In an attempt to form orally active penicillins unrelated to ampicillin, use was made of the fact that certain spiro Œ±-amino acids, such as Cycloleucine, are well absorbed orally and transported like normal amino acids. Cyclacillin synthesis: Reaction of cyclohexanone with ammonium carbonate and KCN under the conditions of the Bucherer-Bergs reaction led to hydantoin 1. On acid hydrolysis, Œ±-amino acid 2 resulted. Treatment with phosgene both protected the amino group and activated the carboxyl group toward amide formation (as 3) and reaction with 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) gave cyclacillin (4).

Gordon was born at Fountains Hall near Ripon, in Yorkshire, England on 2 August 1800 and educated at the Grammar School in Ripon. On leaving school he was articled to a general practitioner at Otley. He further studied medicine at London and Edinburgh, and set up a medical practice at Welton in Northumberland. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society of London, and completed his M.D. in 1841. Settling in Hull as a fully qualified physician, he became closely involved with Christian movements and as an active advocate of many of the claims put forwards by the working classes, became known as 'the poor man's friend'. His only child, Charlotte, was born at Welton in 1828. When only four years old he taught her elements of Latin and botany, and thought it a disgrace that the education of ladies should be merely that of superficial accomplishments, sending her to London for an education and writing to her every day enclosing botanical specimens. She was married at the Albion Chapel, Hull on 14 April 1846, to the chapel's Congregational pastor Christopher Newman Hall. Towards the end of his life Gordon became president of the Hull Christian Temperance Society. His funeral sermon was preached in Albion Chapel, Hull by his son-in-law Christopher Newman Hall, and published. A public subscription monument was raised over his grave in his honour.

The site was first used in 1933 as mixed civilian/military airfield and was the base for ‚ÄòY‚Äô Flight of No. 1 Anti- Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF in 1937, using de Havilland DH.82 Queen Bee unmanned radio-controlled target drone. The airfield was passed on to the War Office in September 1946 and the site, now known as the Royal Artillery Range Manorbier, is currently used by the Ministry of Defence as a testing range for high-velocity missiles.  History  RAF Manorbier started as a mixed civil and military airfield in 1933. The 8th Earl of Essex kept his aircraft there while the RAF used it as a landing ground for land-based aircraft visiting the flying boat base of Pembroke Dock, however this ended in 1935. The site, consisting of a grass runway and canvas tents, was then used as an anti- aircraft training school from the spring of 1937 with de Havilland Queen Bees, a pilot-less radio-controlled version of the de Havilland Tiger Moth trainer, which was used for anti-aircraft gunnery practice. The runway was enlarged in 1940 and the airfield acquired catapults to launch Queen Bees from clifftops so gunnery practice could be continued when the grass runways were flooded. Defences were also fitted to the airfield, including the Pickett-Hamilton retractable pillbox, which can be fitted with different calibre guns and can be raised or lowered hydraulically. From 1939, the Pilotless Aircraft Unit (PAU) was based permanently at Manorbier, using a tender to retrieve drones from the sea and return them back to the base. The unit continued to use the airfield even after the war. The airfield was occupied by No. 11 Group RAF in 1944, it was also occupied by No. 595 Squadron RAF from 1 December 1943. The squadron flew a wide variety of aircraft, including the Hawker Henley Mk III, Hawker Hurricane Mks IIC and IV, Miles Martinet, Airspeed Oxford, Vultee Vengeance and the Supermarine Spitfire Mks VB, XII, IX and XVI. The squadron left on 27 April 1946. The following units were here at some point: * No. 2767 Squadron RAF Regiment * No. 4109 Anti-Aircraft Flight RAF Regiment  Current use  The site is currently used as training and testing range for the British Army known as Air Defence Range Manorbier, the testing range fires a maximum of 750 surface-to-air missile each year on 100 designated testing days. The principle weapon system fired at Manorbier was fitted for night operation in 2005, the only suitable site for testing new night vision technology at the time. The Ministry of Defence also proposed a plan to launch a maximum of 100 missile for 20 nights a year. This was met with opposition from the locals who claimed that should the plan be approved, tourism will suffer and air pollution in the area will increase.

Gameplay Like most MMORPGs, game play centers on venturing into dungeons and combating monsters in real-time. The players combat monsters and complete quests, in the process acquiring in-game currency, experience points (EXP), and various items. Players can kill monsters alone, or they can form a party. They can also form a party or solo a party quest by themselves (max 4 people including yourself). Characters The game features 3 different races (each come in male or female), which can take up arms with different guardians. Here is a summary of the races: The Guardians bring some unique features to the game: * The characters can ‚Äúbecome one‚Äù with their guardian. The Andras rides on its robot, the Talli transforms into its hero, and the Silva rides on its dragon. * At level 10, the player is then asked to go talk to an NPC (NonPlayer Character) that gives the player a job enhancement. This gives you a two new skills (one passive, one active) which 'level up', or enhance, on their own for every two levels you gain. * Both the pilot and guardian can equip different equipments which change their respective appearances * At level 20 the player will be automatically given the ability to fly. However, there are some places where the player can not fly, such places as in party quests and jump quests. Race : Andras The Andras race most closely resembles humans. They specialize in advanced technology, so for that reason their guardian is a robot. Their robot wields swords, guns, and hammers. This race has more health than the others. Damage is based on \\"STR\\". Race : Talli The Talli race looks very much like elves in most games. They have white skin and pointed ears. They actually transform into their guardian which is a kind of dark hero. Their skills revolve around status effecting magic and damaging their enemies. Can use knuckle for long range(add int and wisdom for more power) and Daggers for Close range(Add str and agility for more power) Race : Silva The Silva race has brown skin and horns.

Heart-leaf milkweed was valued by the Native American Miwok tribe for its stems, which they dried and processed into string and rope. Description follicle Heart-leaf milkweed is a perennial that grows to a height of , with dark red- purple flowers whose hoods are slightly elevated above the base of the corolla.Jepson Manual The flower structure is unusual‚Äîit has five stamens fused into a column, with five circular attachments called 'hoods', and an anther head surrounding the large stigma at the flower's center. The fruit (photo at left) is a follicle with many flat seeds that have silky hairs which disperse easily in the wind. The large opposite leaves are cordate, or heart- shaped. The plant grows in open or shaded woodland, often on rocky slopes and in mixed coniferous forest. The milkweeds are named for the milky sap which exudes from the plant's stem. It blooms from May to July. Taxonomy The species name, cordifolia (Latin for 'heart-leaved'), refers to the heart- shaped leaves, while the genus name honors the Greek physician Asclepius. Ecology Monarch butterfly caterpillars are commonly found on all the milkweeds, including the heart-leaf milkweed. Even after the caterpillar has metamorphosed into a butterfly, the alkaloids they ingest from the plant are retained in the butterfly, making it unpalatable to predators. Uses The Miwok gathered heart-leaf milkweed in the summer and dried it, or collected it in the fall after it was already dry. The dry stems were combed with a loop of willow to draw out the fiber just beneath the very thin outer skin. The fiber was wound into balls for storage and later processing. The making of cordage (rope and string) was done entirely by hand, with no tools. Asclepias was also used by the Native American Yokut or Mariposa in northern and central California for string or rope. A single Miwok feather skirt or cape was made with approximately 100 feet of cordage, requiring about 500 plant stalks. A 40-foot-long deer net contained about 7,000 feet of cordage, requiring the harvesting of approximately 35,000 plant stalks. The milkweed stalks were burned in the fall to eliminate dead stalks and stimulate the next year's growth, and to stimulate flower and seed production. Cordage was typically two-ply, though there are some examples at the Field Museum of three- and four-ply Miwok cordage. Heart-leaf milkweed was also used as a contraceptive and snakebite remedy, though without proper preparation it can cause vomiting in low doses and death in higher doses due to a mix of cardenolides in the sap. At one time it was classified as a noxious weed because of reported negative effects on livestock.

It is part of the Kennedy-Fraser collection and it appeared in a book entitled 'Songs of the Hebrides' published in 1917, with the eponymous title by the Celtic poet Kenneth Macleod. The poem is headed by the statement 'Written for the lads in France during the Great War'. The impression is given by the notes appended to the book that the author was Kenneth Macleod himself. Marjory Kennedy-Fraser toured the Western Isles of Scotland in the summer of 1917 and collected a group of local tunes. The tune associated with the Road to the Isles was an air played by Malcolm Johnson of Barra on a chanter and composed by Pipe Major John McLellan of Dunoon (originally titled \\"The Burning Sands of Egypt\\"). Kenneth Macleod then wrote the words for a voice and harp (or piano) arrangement of this air by Patuffa Kennedy-Fraser. The tune is a march of the British Army. It is said to have been played by Bill Millin, piper to Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat, during the first day of the Normandy Landings on D-Day during World War II, during a daring Commando attack during Operation Roast in the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, and also at the start of construction on Toronto's first subway line, under Yonge Street, in 1949. The lyrics mention first the hills of the Isle of Skye (whose memory is calling the traveller west); then the successive locations he will pass on the way across the Western Highlands and Inner and Outer Hebrides. The locations mentioned are (in this order): the Cuillin Hills (on the Isle of Skye), Tummel and Loch Rannoch (both in Perthshire), Lochaber (a district in the western Scottish Highlands), Shiel (a reference to Loch Shiel west of Fort William), Ailort (near the Sound of Arisaig), Morar (near Loch Morar), the Skerries (rocky islets ‚Äì in this case, just off Skye), and the Lews (a former name of the Isle of Lewis). A cromach or cromack is a shepherd's crook or stick.Caledonian Sticks (Fancy Crooks and Cromachs) \\"Tangle\\", or sea tangle, is oarweed or similar seaweed. Lyrics A far croonin' is pullin' me away As take I wi' my cromach to the road. The far Cuillins are puttin' love on me As step I wi' the sunlight for my load. Chorus Sure by Tummel and Loch Rannoch and Lochaber I will go By heather tracks wi' heaven in their wiles. If it's thinkin' in your inner heart the braggart's in my step You've never smelled the tangle o' the Isles. Oh the far Cuillins are puttin' love on me As step I wi' my cromach to the Isles. It's by Shiel water the track is to the west By Ailort and by Morar to the sea The cool cresses I am thinkin' of for pluck And bracken for a wink on Mother¬¥s knee. The blue islands are pullin' me away Their laughter puts the leap upon the lame The blue islands from the Skerries to the Lews Wi' heather honey taste upon each name. Influence A number of parodies have been based upon the tune to this song. Notable examples include \\"Leo McGuire's Song\\" by Billy Connolly and \\"Scottish Holiday\\" by The Corries. The tune was used by Ewan MacColl for his rambling song \\"Mass Trespass 1932\\", a forerunner of his song \\"The Manchester Rambler\\". The Wiggles used this tune as \\"Do the Highland Fling\\" on their \\"Dance, Dance!\\" CD and DVD and \\"Nursery Rhymes\\" YouTube video and CD.

Dsh (Dvl in mammals) is a cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that acts directly downstream of frizzled receptors. It takes its name from its initial discovery in flies, where a mutation in the dishevelled gene was observed to cause improper orientation of body and wing hairs. There are vertebrate homologs in zebrafish, Xenopus (Xdsh), mice (Dvl1, -2, -3) and humans (DVL-1, -2, -3). Dsh relays complex Wnt signals in tissues and cells, in normal and abnormal contexts. It is thought to interact with the novel protein, SPATS1, when regulating the Wnt Signalling pathway. Dishevelled plays important roles in both the embryo and the adult, ranging from cellular differentiation and cell polarity to social behavior. Members There are three human genes that encode for the dishevelled proteins: * DVL1 * DVL2 * DVL3 Overview of signal transduction pathways involved in apoptosis.  Function  DVL is an integral part of the Wnt canonical pathway (Œ≤-catenin dependent) and non-canonical pathway (Œ≤-catenin-independent). In either of these, DVL acts downstream of a Frizzled receptor, although the pathways are distinct. Wnt canonical pathway  The Wnt canonical pathway, also known as the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway, is activated during development, regulation, cell differentiation, and proliferation. The Wnt canonical pathway moves DVL between the cytoplasm and nucleus, via a conserved nuclear export sequence (NES) and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), both necessary for proper functioning. The binding of Wnt to Frizzled receptors helps recruit DVL to the membrane, providing a site for Axin and GSK3Œ≤ to bind and phosphorylate LRP5/6 (transmembrane low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein), preventing constitutive degradation of Œ≤-catenin. The prevention of this degradation DVL allows for Œ≤-catenin buildup in the nucleus, where it acts as a coactivator for TCF (T cell factor) to activate Wnt responsive genes. Conversely, without Wnt signaling, the destruction complex, made of APC, CKI, GSK3Œ≤ and Axin, degrades Œ≤-catenin buildup, keeping the concentration of Œ≤-catenin in the cell low.  Wnt non-canonical pathways  = Planar cell polarity pathway = The planar cell polarity pathway (PCP) is the most notable Œ≤-catenin independent pathway ‚Äì the Wnt signal is received by the Frizzled receptor, which relays signals to DVL, which then acts as a branch point for two independent pathways, leading to the activation of small GTPases Rho and Rac. For the Rho branch, Wnt signals induce DVL to form a complex with Daam1 (Dishevelled associated activator of morphogenesis 1). This complex then interacts with Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor WGEF (weak-similarity GEF), which activates downstream effectors like Rho GTPase and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), which activates actin and cytoskeleton architecture in the cell. For the Rac branch, DVL activates the Rac GTPase. Activating the Rac GTPase stimulates the downstream effector c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which controls rearrangements in the cytoskeleton and gene expression. More specifically, it regulates the polarity and movement of a cell, in processes in vertebrates (like Xenopus) including gastrulation, neural tube closure, and stereocilia orientation in the inner ear. = Wnt-calcium pathway = Another pathway independent of Œ≤-catenin is the Wnt-Ca2+ pathway, which is involved in cancer, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Wnt triggers Frizzled-mediated activation, triggering a cascade leading to Ca2+ release, which activates effectors (e.g. CaMKII) that control gene transcription relevant to cell fate and cell migration. This pathway can switch off the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin cascade and it can also be inhibited by DVL activation.  Structure  There are five main highly conserved regions that exist in all variations of DVL. These include an amino-terminal DIX (N-terminus) domain, a PDZ (central) domain, a carboxyl-terminal DEP (C-terminus) domain, and two regions with positively charged amino acid residues. There is a proline-heavy region between the DIX and PDZ domains, and a largely basic region between the DIX and PDZ domains that has conserved serine and threonine residues. These regions mediate protein-protein interactions and help DVL channel signals into either the Œ≤-catenin or the Œ≤-catenin independent pathways. Additionally, there is the conserved nuclear export sequence (NES) and a nuclear localization sequence (NLS), whose ability to move DVL between the cytoplasm and the nucleus may be an important part of its function. General structure of basic Dvl protein.  DIX Domain (Dishevelled-Axin)  Located near the N-terminus region of DVL and consisting of about 82-85 amino acids for human DVL protein, DIX is found in proteins like Axin and coiled-coil protein DIX- domain-containing I (DIXdc1 or Ccd1). The DIX domain of DVL has five Œ≤-strands and one Œ± helix with highly conserved amino acid residues.  PDZ Domain  PDZ, whose name consists of the initials of first three identified proteins to share this common structural domain (Post synaptic density protein (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor (Dlg1), and Zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1)), lies in the central region of DVL. PDZ typically has about 73 amino acids in each human DVL protein, and consists of 5-6 Œ≤-strands and 2-3 Œ±-helices This motif plays a critical role in ligand binding and conformational properties of the DVL protein. This region mediates many protein-protein interactions and regulates multiple biological processes.  DEP Domain (Dishevelled-EGL-10-Pleackstrin)  DEP, which is in C-terminal domain of DVL, has 75 amino acids in the human DVL proteins, and has three Œ±-helices, a Œ≤-hairpin arm, and two short Œ≤-strands. This domain enables interaction between DVL and DAAM1, thus activating the non-canonical pathway. This domain also has results that support claims that the DEP domain is what is responsible for targeting DVL proteins to the membrane upon Wnt signal stimulation. The DEP domain may also be essential for the assembly of functional signalosomes and for Wnt signal transduction to the nucleus.  NES and NLS regions  In addition to these conserved regions, DVL has both a NES and NLS, which regulate the cellular localization of DVL via movement between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The NLS is between the PDZ and DEP domains, and the NES is between the DEP and C-terminus of DVL.  Dishevelled Post-translational Modifications  There are three mains types of DVL post- translational modification - phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. Phosphorylation is the most well-studied, and seems to act such that site- specific phosphorylation can bring about a wide variety of biological responses. Ubiquitination is the post-translational modification that has a role in regulating DVL degradation.

The line is built to the popular gauge of and runs every weekend throughout the year and all school holidays. Locomotives Steam * Trevithick: An 0-6-2 steam locomotive built for the age of steam in Cornwall by Roger Marsh. * Isambard Kingdom Brunel: A 2-6-0 tender locomotive built by David Curwen also for the age of steam in Cornwall. * Basil the Brigadier: A 2-6-0 + 0-6-2 articulated locomotive, built by Kitsons of Leeds in 1938 for the famous Surrey Border and Camberley Railway. The engine was converted from a scale locomotive to a narrow gauge outline while at the Shillingstone light Railway. The locomotive was re-imported from Belgium where it had been in a private collection. * Peter The Private: An almost identical copy of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, this locomotive first steamed in early 2017. Painted red and privately owned. * Royal Scot: Built in 1938 by Bassett-Lowke, and the only Royal Scot that was made by them. She worked at Hastings Miniature Railway and Oakhill Manor Railway before being exported to the USA. She was re-imported in 2002. * The Engineer: Built by David Curwen, this 4-4-2 Atlantic type locomotive worked on the Weymouth miniature railway. This engine was formerly named 'Merrie England' after a local councilor and painted cream! Arrived from a private collection in Wales in March 2016 she is yet to be restored but has been renamed in honor of her builder. * The Great Bear: Built as 2011 and named 'Corronation' but H.C.S Bullock for the Shoreham miniature railway, this locomotive was driven by Will Hay of 'Oh Mr Porter!' fame to open the infamous Surrey Border and Camberly Railway. Arriving from a private collection in Wales during March 2016, she is in full working order but requires running in before she can pull trains. Diesel *Maurice the Major: The first engine on the railway, built by P. Bowers and E. Laugnly in 1994/5. It is powered by a 3-cylinder Kubota diesel engine. *D1001 Western Independence: Built by David Curwen in 1964 for a railway at Margate Pier. She was originally powered by a 4-litre Perkins diesel engine. This was replaced, by a 3-cylinder Kubota engine and hydraulic drive. *D1002 Western Explorer: Designed by David Curwen, this engine was built in 1965 for the Brooklands Miniature Railway at Brooklands Park in Worthing. Upon change of ownership the engine went to Joe Nemeth to be restored for use on his Berkley Light Railway. When this line changed hands, this engine was bought by the RVR in a part restored condition. This engine now has the same system as Western Independence. *D1011 Western Thunderer: Built by David Curwen in 1964 for the Audley End railway. This engine was driven by the famous racing driver Stirling Moss to open the line. It currently has the original ford slide valve engine, but the intention is to replace this in line with the other diesel locomotives. Ex-locomotives *Ivor: An 0-4-0 saddle tank, owned by a private individual and no longer based on the RVR. *Sir Walter Gower: Built by Walter Gower, the engine ran on the Orchard Farm Railway in Yorkshire. RVR bought the engine, and it was never used, being sold soon after. *Claude the Colonel: Built by P.Bowers during 1999/2000, it is a steam outline Bo-Bo with a 3-cylinder Kubota, and hydraulic system. This engine now resides in Scotland. *Arctic Prince: A Mardyke Hymek locomotive, owned by a private individual and no longer based on the RVR. *St Albans Comet, previously named Western Courier: ran at Basildon miniature railway. The locomotive was bought by a private individual and based at the RVR for a short time before returning to Basildon on loan. *Lynton: a 2-4-4 Tinkerbell class tank engine, built by Narogauge Ltd as 7.25. Previously operated at Moors Valley and Bowlease Railway before being regauged and operating on the portable Pilgrims line. This locomotive was privately owned by a volunteer. *Un-named: Arrived at the same time as Lynton in a part constructed state. This engine is now resident in the carriage works of the Mid Hants Railway at Ropley. The intention is to complete the build and use it on their own miniature railway. *Royal Scot: A second Royal Scot built for the Marquess of Downshire. As with the first one this was imported from the USA. Restoration had begun, but the locomotive was sold before it could run at the railway. Visiting locomotives *Belle: Built by David Curwen and owned by a private individual, this engine visited for the renaming of Basil The Brigadier, with which it once ran at Shillingstone. *Alice: An 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive with a tender based on a Bagnall. The line The ride normally starts at Piccadilly, named after the park road junction just opposite. Tickets are bought from the engine shed, opposite a well laid out yard, which is in fact the area for a new station building. The carriage shed is also here. Upon leaving the station, which is set into the hillside the line curves, crosses a set of points, that lead up to the yard and hence the engine shed, and runs along a straight parallel with Southampton water. The view from here is obscured by gorse hedges. At the end of the straight is another point, put in place for the new extension being built. The train will always curve left here and run inland. On the left, a new double track section can be seen. leading back to the yard and the site of a new terminus station through the carriage shed. The line curves right at this point and begins to descend entering a closely wooded section and then a cutting before and curving around an 'S' bend and emerging onto an embankment. Here there are panoramic views of Southampton Water and the Chapel, last remnant of the once huge military hospital. At the bottom of this embankment is a short section of hedge, which gives way to Chapel Road Station. This station is normally closed. At the far end is a smart ticket office and waiting room. Upon leaving the level chapel road station, the line begins to climb crossing the first level crossing and running between the gorse bank and the car park on an embankment. There is a 'S' bend through a patch of small trees before the line emerges to run below the playground and past the tea rooms just above the former hospital branch track bed. The line curves inland again and crosses a second crossing just opposite the recently refurbished Cedar Tea Rooms. Here the line begins to climb more steeply and, if you are lucky enough to be on a steam engine you can hear the engine working hard to climb the steep grade as it enters some woodland and another cutting, surrounding a large playground. At the deepest point of the cutting the line, curves sharply. This is the sharpest curve on the whole line and will need realigning before the planned tunnel can be built. Curving right, out of the sharp bend and through another 'S', the line runs straight, climbing alongside the sensory garden and emerges from the woods across another level crossing and left past the first playground. Views here run back to the lower level and across to Southampton Water and the chapel. The line then re enters the trees, across the last level crossing, down a short straight which brings us to Piccadilly and the end of our journey. Extension There is in place a new terminus station, opposite the engine shed. This will then lead into the carriage shed, which doubles up as a tunnel. At the other side of it, the line splits into two tracks, and heads south in a shallow cutting. At the end, the left hand line joins the main circuit, but the right hand one stops short of the current mainline. Here it is planned to build a diamond crossing, and a new curve through the woods, to join up with the existing layout. Trains will eventually leave by the left track, travel around the main circuit and then continue straight on at the points to the new loop, over the diamond crossing and return through the carriage shed to the new station terminus. Much of the work has been completed by volunteers including the brick work on the turntable and the block work for the building. Stations * Chapel Road Station * Piccadilly Station Staff The line is run by a group of dedicated volunteers who carry out and perform all the work necessary to improve and maintain the railway. In 2005, the tri-service cadets from Southampton university began construction of the new station building, but complications led to them instead assisting with the track laying on the extension, and the postponing of the building work. Projects There are various other projects ongoing including the completion of Peter the Private, refurbishment of Western Thunderer, completion of the large terminus station and the laying of a small amount of new track to open the extension.

It allows users to listen to music content from record labels, including Universal Music Group, Sony Music and Warner Music Group (owned by Deezer's parent company Access Industries) on various devices online or offline. Created in Paris, France, Deezer currently has 56 million licensed tracks in its library, with over 30,000 radio channels, 14 million monthly active users, and 7 million paid subscribers as of January 2019. The service is available for Web, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, BlackBerry OS, Windows, and MacOS. History First logo of Deezer In 2006, Daniel Marhely developed the first version of Deezer, called Blogmusik, in Paris. His idea was to give unlimited access to music lovers through streaming technology. The site in its original incarnation was charged with copyright infringement by French agency SACEM, and after being shut down in April 2007, it was relaunched as Deezer in August 2007, having reached an agreement with SACEM to pay copyright holders with revenue from advertising on the site and by giving users the ability to download songs streamed on Deezer from iTunes, with Deezer receiving a commission from each purchase. Launch At the time of its launch in 2007, Deezer had not yet negotiated agreements with major music labels and therefore offered a limited catalogue. It took more than two years for agreements to be signed with the four largest labels, as well as various smaller ones, but by 2011 the company had rights to about eight million songs. During August 2007, its first month of operations, Deezer saw about 773,000 visitors to its site, with traffic increasing rapidly in the next several years‚Äî2.75 million people used the service in May 2008, and there were seven million users by December 2009. Despite the high traffic, Deezer almost immediately ran into financial problems‚Äîduring the first half of 2008, the company saw revenue of just 875,000 euros, not enough to pay its licensing fees. In July 2008, the company began running ads itself through advertising agency Deezer Media; in October, Deezer secured $8.4 million in funding from AGF Private Equity and CM-CIC Capital Prive, bringing total investment in the company to $15.8 million. The company introduced mandatory registration in February 2009 to gather more precise data on users, in order to run more targeted ads, and in November 2009 began running audio ads between songs. On 5 November 2009, Deezer launched a new three-tier service model. While continuing basic free web streaming, the company also introduced two subscription services‚Äîusers paying ‚Ç¨4.99 monthly received higher-quality music without ads, and users paying ‚Ç¨9.99 monthly gained access to downloadable applications for computers, as well as Android, BlackBerry, and iOS mobile devices. In January 2010, the company's CEO and co- founder, Jonathan Benassaya, was replaced as CEO by Axel Dauchez, after fewer than 15,000 of Deezer's 12 million users signed up for its subscription services. In August 2010, mobile operator Orange partnered with Deezer in a deal to include free access to Deezer Premium, the highest tier of Deezer's streaming packages, with some of Orange's telecommunications contracts in France. Almost immediately after the partnership began, the rate of users signing up for Deezer's premium services went from 6,000 a month to 100,000; by January 2011, 500,000 people were subscribing to the service, with the million-subscriber mark reached in the middle of 2011, half a year ahead of schedule. The two companies expanded their partnership in September 2011 to include Orange contract customers in the United Kingdom. Also in September, Deezer added Facebook integration to its service, allowing users to send music to one another via that social media service. Expansion to more countries Availability of Deezer in the world Deezer was launched in France in 2007, where it was the market leader as of 2017. On 7 December 2011, Deezer, at the time available only in Belgium, France and the United Kingdom, announced plans to expand worldwide during the rest of 2011 and continuing into 2012. According to the company, it planned to make its services available to the whole of Europe by the end of the year, to the Americas (excluding the United States) by the end of January 2012, to Africa and Southeast Asia by the end of February, and the rest of the world (excluding Japan) by the end of June. It took until 15 March 2012 for service to be available across the whole of Europe, while service launched in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand on 25 April. On 8 June, Deezer announced availability in 35 Latin American countries, though not in Brazil, Cuba, or Venezuela. On 15 August, Deezer announced it would be available in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand within several weeks. On 8 October 2012, Deezer announced that it had received $130 million in funding from Access Industries, to be used for further international expansion. Two days later, the company announced that it had expanded into 76 new markets, bringing its worldwide total to 160 countries. On 21 December, Deezer announced a new service level offering two hours of free, ad-supported music streaming a month, available to users worldwide, the company's first free music streaming service outside France. CEO Dauchez said that Deezer was also looking for a partner to introduce service in the United States, who was \\"able to provide us with a significant volume of subscribers\\" to help offset what he called the \\"unbelievably high\\" costs of entering the US market. As of December 2012, Deezer had about two million users paying for subscriptions, out of a monthly active user base of about seven million, with 20 million songs in its library. By 2016, according to CEO Dauchez, the company aimed to have five percent of the global music market. In January 2013, Deezer announced its expansion into 22 new countries across Africa, Asia, Brazil, the Middle East, and the United States, bringing its total to 182.Deezer compte se lancer aux Etats-Unis en 2014, Challenges, 20 November 2013 However, the United States launch has been restricted to a limited number of device promotions.Deezer, entering US www.cnet.com.

The four-year armed-conflict resulted in the annexation of the Banda Oriental into the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves as the Brazilian province of Cisplatina. The belligerents were, on one side, the \\"artiguistas\\" led by Jos√© Gervasio Artigas and some leaders of other provinces that made up the Federal League, like Andr√©s Guazurary, and on the other, the troops of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, directed by Carlos Frederico Lecor. On the naval front, the conflict far exceeded the Rio de la Plata and the Argentine coast to spread globally, as the Insurgent Privateers, most notably under the flag of Buenos Aires and flag of Artigas, harassed Portuguese and Spanish ships in Europe, Africa and the Caribbean.  Causes  The causes that led King John VI of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, whose court had been installed in Rio de Janeiro since 1808, to embark on the invasion of the Banda Oriental can be divided into general and circumstantial. Among the first is located in the main place, the former Portuguese aspiration to bring the frontiers of Brazil to the coast of Rio de la Plata (), arguing that it matched the Tordesillas line by which Spain and Portugal had divided the world in 1494. For that reason, the region of the Rio de la Plata was a border area between Spain and Portugal, and as such, a highly conflictive area and theater of bloody battles over the centuries, even after the American colonies became independent of the European powers. The R√≠o de la Plata was strategic because it is the starting point of a large river basin, the fifth in the world, that goes to the heart of South America, from near mining areas in Potosi (current Bolivia), through Paraguay, Mato Grosso and reaching S√£o Paulo. Additionally, the Banda Oriental, in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, was an area of major agricultural wealth, which was organized on the old dairy and beef production, a staple of African slaves who constituted the Brazilian economic base Following that line of historical conflict, Buenos Aires was founded in 1536 to prevent the Portuguese from extending beyond the R√≠o de la Plata. During the period between 1580 and 1640, in which the Kingdom of Portugal was part of the Iberian Union together with the Kingdom of Spain under the \\"Catholic Monarchy\\", Spain relaxed precautions on the ill-defined borders between the two kingdoms, a circumstance that Portugal took to expand the territory of Brazil, to the west and south. In 1680 the Kingdom of Portugal founded the Colonia del Sacramento (), the first settlement in what is now Uruguay, right in front of Buenos Aires, on the other bank of the Rio de la Plata. Since then several clashes occur and precarious agreements between the Portuguese and Spanish in the Banda Oriental and the Misiones. Portugal also took the troubled political circumstances produced from Napoleon's invasion of Spain in 1808, introducing the Princess Carlota Joaquina, wife of John VI and sister of King Ferdinand VII, captive of Napoleon, as the best alternative to protect the interests of Spanish crown. However, the common struggle against Napoleon Bonaparte, who invaded Spain in order to attack Portugal, as their government they disregarded the continental blockade imposed by him to Britain, led Portugal to avoid a disagreement with Spain and the occupation projects were delayed. The occupation of the Misiones Orientales () in 1801 by Portuguese troops, commanded by bandeirante Jos√© Francisco Borges do Canto and attempts to generate a protectorate during the crisis of 1808, were closer antecedents. The crisis began when the governor of Montevideo Francisco Javier de Elio came into conflict with the Viceroy of the R√≠o de la Plata, Santiago de Liniers, who came to the political break with the constitution of the Junta of Montevideo on 21 September that year. The Portuguese monarchy took advantage of the situation by sending the military and diplomatic Joaqu√≠n Javier Curado to offer, in terms restraining orders, acceptance of the protectorate in the Banda Oriental on the argument the preserve it from a Viceroy considered \\"Afrancesado\\". Elio rejected the offer at first, but the course of political events from the 1810 May Revolution in Buenos Aires allowed the Portuguese, on two occasions, to attempt armed seizure of the territory. Those times were 1811 and 1816. The Portuguese invasion of 1811, was the result of a request by then viceroy of R√≠o de la Plata, Francisco Javier de Elio, in support of the Spanish authorities against artiguist revolutionaries. This invasion took place in the context, as already mentioned, of the May Revolution, where the influence of the same El√≠o established the capital of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata in Montevideo, thereby becoming viceroy. The revolution had infiltrated in the Banda Oriental after the Cry of Asencio. Jos√© Rondeau and Jos√© Artigas commanded the troops that, after the Battle of Las Piedras, besieged Montevideo on May 21, 1811. Elio, despite being besieged and in considerable difficulty, managed to block with a royalist naval fleet the port of Buenos Aires and called for help from the Portuguese. A month later, in July, was dispatched from Rio de Janeiro to the south an army of 4,000 men under General Diego de Souza. Defeated in Paraguay and Upper Peru, and stopped by the Elio naval blockade, the government of Buenos Aires sought an agreement with Montevideo in exchange for removing the naval blockade and the withdrawal of the Portuguese. The artiguists rejected the deal, which left them helpless against the enemy, and followed Artigas in the episode known as the Oriental Exodus. The Portuguese troops had not left the eastern territory until August 1812 when, with the support of the British government, Buenos Aires ensured compliance of the 1811 Armistice Agreement 1811 through the Rademaker-Herrera deal of 1812. The context of 1816, with the state of war between the Orientals and Buenos Aires (which virtually ensured the neutrality, at least, the neutrality of Buenos Aires to the occupation of the Oriental territory) and the European context, marked by the absolutist restoration that denied the colonies their right to independence from the monarchies (which guaranteed Portugal against any hostile reaction from Spain ), proved ideal for the realization of the old goal. Those were the main circumstances. The ailing Portuguese royal family that had emigrated to Rio de Janeiro in 1808 fleeing from Napoleon's invasion had nothing to do with the proud Court that concerned Britain in 1816 for its expansionist aspirations. Much water had flowed under the bridges and other winds blowing in Europe and America. The endless possibilities of large and rich country of Brazil, economic development produced by the opening of Brazilian ports to international trade-decision of 1808 - and remoteness from European conflicts resulted in a bold idea of the Portuguese political leadership. Convert Brazil to the center of decision and permanent seat of the kingdom and its authorities. The presence of the Portuguese government in America has substantially changed the geopolitical vision of its leaders. This idea was seriously considered by the king, particularly after the death of his mother, Queen Maria, which occurred in March 1816, who was mentally inhibited from long ago. The Prince Regent finally ascended the throne under the name of John VI. The flamboyant monarch gave his decidedly biased American policy. Brazil seemed to assure the Braganza a first order global destination, which the little Portugal would no longer offer. A decree almost immediately transformed the Kingdom of Portugal in the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, Brazil was no longer a colony and passed to form the Kingdom of Brazil, essential part of the state. From that moment the expansionist policy was accentuated and the idea of an Empire of Brazil was encouraged and supported. Such a policy did not coincide with the plans of Britain, which was opposed by the British minister Lord Strangford, who previously had a strong influence on the Brazilian government. The dispute culminated when the king himself called to London, in April 1815, to replace the diplomat, which was accepted almost immediately. These circumstances did not alter the old dependency of Portugal, and then of Imperial Brazil, regarding the economic policy of the British Empire. But the relative emancipation of John VI regarding the British power had hitherto closely monitored allowed Portuguese politics execute his old plan to invade and annex the Banda Oriental. Particular interest in the project, had the planters of Rio Grande do Sul, which on the one hand, aspired to control the overseas port of Montevideo as a way to channel their business (the strong regional and even separatist tendencies in the region had the highest interest in having its own exit that would link to international trade), and on the other hand, were concerned about the implementation of rural artiguista regulation, adopted in September 1815, which established the right of confiscation of the lands of the enemies of the revolution with its disrespect for property rights and the phenomenon of rural populace dividing the land, under the banner \\"The most unhappy are the most privileged\\". In addition, under the chaos prevailing in the United Provinces, which declared independence after the Congress of Tucum√°n, and the \\"radicalism\\" of Artigas, he regarded the Banda Oriental as a dangerous center spread of \\"anarchy\\" to impulses of the \\"Montoneros\\" federalist and republican. No wonder then that the Marquis of Alegrete riograndense warlord, has made maximum efforts for the project, and that those who were later prominent leaders of separatism riograndense, Bento Gon√ßalves da Silva and Bentos Manuel Ribeiro, have played with it a leading role. Also, Spanish and American emigrants who sought refuge in Brazil persuaded the Portuguese and Brazilian King John VI, to initiate a military campaign on the Banda Oriental. Gaspar de Vigodet, last Spanish colonial governor of Montevideo and the Spanish friar Cirilo Alameda promoted the adventure with the hope that, once obtained the victory, Portugal would return those territories to Spanish rule. The locals unit exiled by the Fontezuelas Mutiny led by Carlos de Alvear, expected a defeat of Artigas, leader of federalism, and supplied the Portuguese-Brazilian Court with any information, to support their plans. Anti-artiguists orientals (Mateo Magari√±os, Jos√© Batlle and Carre√≥) also made an important effort in this regard. Particular importance was Nicolas Herrera, former secretary of the government of Alvear deposed in 1815. Herrera arrived in Rio de Janeiro in exile, disgraced and bankrupt, but his undeniable charm and talent enabled him to persuade Antonio de Araujo y Acevedo, Count da Barca, one of the chief advisers of John VI. Soon those responsible for Portuguese-Brazilian politics appreciated the knowledge of the lawyer in respect to geography and political reality of the province to annex. Complicity of Buenos Aires The main drawback of the campaign of conquest lay in the possibility that the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata react in defense of a territory which formed part of the country since its inception. Certainly it was not convenient to Portugal that the annexation of the Banda Oriental resulted in a difficult war, against all the provinces of La Plata. According to Uruguayan historians Washington Reyes Abadie, Oscar H. Bruschera and Tabar√© Melogno, and the Argentine Ra√∫l Scalabrini Ortiz, the information about Buenos Aires neutrality was first given by Manuel Jose Garcia, sent to negotiate with Britain and the court in Rio de Janeiro that they do not support the Spanish Empire, at a time when it was trying to recover the independent colonies. According to the Uruguayan writer Lincoln Maiztegui Casas, \\"Garcia with his ideal and interventional unit used all his influence to persuade the Portuguese King that the government of Buenos Aires would not take military action to keep the Oriental territory.\\" Regarding the role of Juan Martin de Pueyrred√≥n, who took office in 1816 as Supreme Director of the United Provinces replacing Alvear, Maiztegui Casas asserts that although he differed from the radical Unitarianism of those who had commissioned Garcia, he thought that the unitarian party was not strong enough to subdue the federal movement, which quickly spread over the provinces; Pueyrred√≥n, same as the previous rulers, was sympathetic to a defeat of Artigas, still considering him an expression of barbarism. Pueyrred√≥n's attitude was ambiguous against the Portuguese invasion, accounting for one side that it implied in Buenos Aires the struggle against federalism and artiguismo in particular, but on the other hand also to a public in Buenos Aires that massively opposed to segregation of the territory and the British interests seeking the creation of a small independent state. Ultimately, Pueyrred√≥n as supreme director, collaborated with the invasion, not only because he did not declare war on the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves to the occupation of part of the country he governed, but because he steadily attacked the provinces of the Federal League, which were inhibited to cooperate with the defense of the territory organized by Artigas. But it also happened after of facts that can not be omitted, including the intransigence of the Protector, Artigas who systematically and firmly refused to recognize the authority of the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of Rio de la Plata, which led him to the conviction that Artigas was intratable. Pueyrred√≥n, expressing a political line that held differences with predominantly Unity Party in Buenos Aires since 1812, and was taken with considerable concern the Portuguese invasion of the Banda Oriental, with no objective reasons to ensure that such attitude was apparent. First, Nicolas de Vedia sent to interview Lecor, leading a trade to ensure that the invasion did not continue to Entre Rios, but that he had instructions to \\"keep on Buenos Aires strict neutrality\\". The commissioner returned to Buenos Aires a letter of assurance that would not pass the Portuguese adventure in the Oriental Province, obtained in conversation with Nicolas Herrera. Then Pueyrred√≥n sent some weapons and war supplies to Artigas (low volume, but as a testimony of good will; 300 frames and 100 pounds of gunpowder), issued a loan of 200,000 pesos for military spending and war, a committee responsible for organizing the potential conflict. Military planification Portuguese preparations The Portuguese army had between 10,000 and 12,000 men, including fully armed and disciplined European veterans of the Napoleonic Wars and local Brazilian troops. An effective intelligence service, which allowed them to determine accurately the main steps of Artigas, and watchful care of every detail, with 30 doctors in the health service. The first transports arrived in Rio de Janeiro, at the end of March next year. The rest of the division made it to the end of March 1816. The division was commanded by General Carlos Federico Lecor. The May 13, 1816, birthday of the new king, John VI observed with praise and wonder his new invasion troops. The plan of operations behaved offensively, invading the Banda Oriental and the area of Argentine Mesopotamia. The \\"Instructions of His Majesty King John VI\\" to General Lecor, signed by the Marquis de Aguilar, the June 4, 1816 are particularly illustrative for understanding the motives and purposes of the Portuguese action in the Platine territories. With respect to Artigas, he prevented Lecor that although the Portuguese force had strength to beat him, it was advisable to negotiate with him if possible, under the conditions that his military body was dissolved, that he would move to reside in Rio de Janeiro or another place that his Majesty allowed, that he would deliver his weapons, that he would receive a salary similar to the Portuguese infantry colonels and that he would be allowed to sell his possessions and goods. As for his officers and troops, they could be admitted in the Portuguese army, under his discretion. Finally, it was recommended to keep scrit neutrality with the government of Buenos Aires, and in the case of being asked he would deny any intention of moving to the other side of the Rio de la Plata. The day after these Instructions were issued - on June 5, 1816 - John VI appointed Lecor Governor and Captain General of Montevideo. Portuguese forces The preparation of the Lusitanian invasion had already begun in mid-1815. As the Prince Regent had informed the Court of Madrid, the Royal Volunteer Division sent from Lisbon to Brazil, which represented the elite corps of the invasion, commanded by Lecor. The British William Carr Beresford, made Marshal of the Portuguese Army, acted as advisor. The division was composed of two brigades, commanded by Brigadiers Jorge de Avillez Zuzarte and Francisco Homem de Magalh√£es Pizarro, consisting each of two battalions of Ca√ßadores (light infantry), eight companies, three squadrons of cavalry and an artillery park, a total of 4,831 pieces. This division of Royal Volunteers had 6,000 men in total. Lecor decided to modify the order of operations, despite the detailed instructions, fearing the climate. In Santa Catarina he traded his land troops to Porto Alegre, arranging a new plan with Captain General of Rio Grande, Marquis of Alegrete. According to it, Lecor himself at the head of the Royal Volunteers, march along the route of the Atlantic coast, in the direction of Maldonado and Montevideo. The Royal Volunteer Division was also called South Column or Lecor Division, and had to be protected and flanked by naval squadron commanded by Count of Viana. After the Division of General Bernardo Silveira invaded Cerro Largo, taking aim to Paysand√∫ and with the mission to protect the right flank of Lecor with their 2,000 men of the Royal Volunteer Cavalry and 800 riograndense militias. Lieutenant Colonel Abreu, with 650 men would come to reinforce the colonel Chagas in the Eastern Missions, aiming to advance on the Eastern Missions and the Province of Misiones. Meanwhile, Jardim ensure greater communication between these two chiefs and would monitor the native minuanes and charr√∫as in Santa Ana and Haedo. Finally, a large reserve, commanded by Lieutenant General Javier Joaquin Curado stayed at the Ibirapui√° Chico, able to come to the support of any of the other contingents. It consisted of 2,000 men and 11 pieces of artillery. Plan of Artigas Artigas learned in the first half of January 1816 the Lusitanian intentions. He suspected this for several letters he had intercepted. On January 11 he gave instructions to Andres Guazurary, to prevent the entry of Portuguese into the territory. He also left instructions to withdraw from Candelaria, sending an observation force to Paraguay, to settle in Santo Tom√© and watch the movements of Paraguay and Portugal. From there they would be near La Cruz, Yapey√∫ and other places in danger of being invaded. Similar instructions were sent to the other authorities two days later. Artigas took many provisions for the upcoming conflict, whose pace was intensified in the following months. Cavalry corps were organized and distributed in the strategic steps guards, and the requised weapons and ammunition gunpowder was sent to Purificaci√≥n. Artigas had a counter-offensive plan: go up the Uruguay River and invade the populations near the Ibicuy River, taking the war to Brazil, and cutting the armies from reinforcements. He created as well the military units of \\"c√≠vicos\\" and \\"libertos\\" Battles of the War * Santa Ana (1816) * Ibiraoca√≠ (1816) * Carumb√© (1816) * India Muerta (1816) * Sauce (1816) * Pablo Perez (1816) * River Ibicu√≠ (1817) * Arapey (1817) * Catal√°n (1817) * Ap√≥steles (1817) * San Carlos (1817) * Chapicuy (1817) * Queguay Chico (1817) * Pando (1818) * Manga (1818) * Arroyo Grande (1818) * Santa Mar√≠a (1819) * Queguay Chico (1817) * Tacuaremb√≥ (1820) Consequences At the end of the Portuguese invasion, over 4000 Uruguayans (6% of the entire population of the Banda Oriental) had been killed by the invaders in three and a half years of bloody war. The Banda Oriental, now called the Cisplatina Province, became first part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and in 1822 of the Empire of Brazil after its independence from Portugal. In 1828, after the Cisplatine War, Uruguay became an independent state.

The present-day lighthouse was built in 1890, although Vinga has been a significant island for mariners long before that. This lighthouse is the third built on the island. It is one of Sweden's most noted lighthouses and a special symbol for the city of Gothenburg.  History  The first tower was built in 1841, it was the first Swedish lighthouse with lens. A second was built in 1854 to make Vinga a \\"double light\\", since there had been complaints that it was hard to tell the difference between the lighthouse in Skagen, Denmark, and Vinga, Sweden, from afar. The flame ran on colza oil. In the 1880s the need for a better and higher lighthouse was urgent and in 1890 the new lighthouse was built, it ran on paraffin. The lantern on the second lighthouse was removed and it was transformed into a watchtower (the red and gray short tower on the picture). The first lighthouse was demolished and only the foundation remains. In 1948, the tower was electrified and in 1974, it was automated. It is now remote controlled by the Swedish Maritime Administration, who wanted to deactivate the lighthouse in 2007 since the commercial shipping did not need it anymore. The proposition met with heavy opposition and the tower is still active. The Vinga station also has a distinctive red pyramid, a day beacon, adjacent to the tower. It was built in 1857.  Cultural significance  Today, Vinga lighthouse is a popular tourist attraction, and during summer there are often guided tours on the island. The Swedish poet and musician Evert Taube was the son of one of the light keepers. Being born the same year (1890) the third lighthouse was built, he spent his childhood there.

Gaskin and his wife Georgie Gaskin were members of the Birmingham Group of Artist-Craftsmen, which sought to apply the principles of the Arts and Crafts movement across the decorative arts. Like many of the group, Gaskin studied at the Birmingham School of Art under Edward R. Taylor and later taught there. Life Gaskin was born in the Lee Bank area of Birmingham in 1862, the son of a decorator. He was brought up in Wolverhampton where he attended Wolverhampton Grammar School before returning to Birmingham in 1879. In 1883 Gaskin entered the Birmingham School of Art, being appointed to the teaching staff two years later despite not completing his course. It was here that he met Georgie Gaskin in 1888, one of his students, whom he married in 1894. Gaskin worked as a decorative artist from 1890, producing woodcut illustrations for William Morris's Kelmscott Press, and painted in tempera after receiving instruction from his friend Joseph Southall at Southall's studio in Edgbaston. The Gaskins started producing jewellery from 1899 under the name \\"Mr & Mrs Arthur Gaskin\\", and in 1903 Arthur was appointed headmaster of the Vittoria Street School for Jewellers and Silversmiths, where he was to remain until 1924, when the couple retired to Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, near the Guild and School of Handicraft established in that town as a community of artists and craftspeople by the arts and crafts architect Charles Robert Ashbee. As a Member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists (RBSA), Gaskin was instrumental in organising the exhibition \\"The New Movement in Art\\" at the Society in 1917.

Prevalence Bolivia‚Äôs first case of HIV was diagnosed in 1985, and since then the epidemic has been largely concentrated in groups of men who have sex with men (MSM). In May 2007, the Government of Bolivia reported a total of 2,464 cases of HIV since the beginning of the epidemic. UNAIDS, which included estimates of unknown cases, reported in 2005 that 7,000 people in Bolivia were HIV-infected, but estimates vary widely between 3,800 and 17,000 people. HIV prevalence rates in Bolivia are highest among MSM, who had infection levels of 15 percent in La Paz and nearly 24 percent in Santa Cruz, according to a 2005 report cited by UNAIDS. Homeless boys and girls also appear to be vulnerable to HIV infection. A recent study of street youth in Cochabamba found that 3.5 percent were HIV-positive. In part because of governmental regulation that requires sex workers to regularly visit sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics for checkups, HIV rates among sex workers have remained low; however, patterns from other countries in the region suggest that Bolivian sex workers may be another population at risk for HIV/AIDS. Several factors put Bolivia in danger of a wider HIV/AIDS epidemic, including high levels of migration from rural to urban areas and social norms that encourage men to have multiple sexual partners. According to the 2003 Bolivia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), 23 percent of single men aged 15 to 49 had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months, which puts them and their sex partners at risk for HIV/AIDS. There is a lack of basic knowledge and information about the disease, with 24 percent of women aged 15 to 49 reporting that they have never heard of the disease. High rates of violence, including sexual abuse, contribute to the spread of the disease. Many false beliefs persist, with 45 percent of those surveyed in the DHS maintaining that a person who looks healthy cannot have HIV. Compounding these issues are stigma and discrimination against HIV-infected individuals and at-risk groups and limited resources at the public and private levels.\\"Health Profile: Bolivia\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. National response The Government of Bolivia has made a political commitment to confront the HIV/AIDS epidemic. However, its allocation of resources to its national STI/HIV/AIDS program has been uneven, and sustainability is not guaranteed. The low levels of HIV funding are due to the limitations of Bolivia‚Äôs health system, which reaches only about 70 percent of the population, and the more immediate threats of other infectious diseases ‚Äì tuberculosis, malaria, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, dengue fever, and yellow fever ‚Äì that demand the majority of Bolivia‚Äôs health funds. Nonetheless, the government consistently signals its dedication to confronting the epidemic. The most recent example is the joint signing in February 2007 of an agreement to implement the Adoption of Attitudes and Practices to Prevent HIV-AIDS at the Interior of the Armed Forces project by the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Health and Sports, the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces, and UNAIDS. Bolivia has been able to mobilise support from the international community, and a large proportion of its funding comes from external sources. For instance, the UN Theme Group and the UNAIDS Country Coordinator support projects targeting vulnerable populations. However, coverage of HIV services to vulnerable groups is low, reaching only 3 percent of MSM and 30 percent of sex workers. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria targets HIV-infected and -affected individuals in nine provinces for integral care, including anti-retroviral treatment (ART); laboratory and psychological support; and treatment of opportunistic illnesses. Currently, however, ART reaches only 24 percent of the target population of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Bolivia is a partner in the Brazil+7 initiative, a UNICEF-, UNAIDS-, and Brazilian-led effort dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for pregnant women and young people; to offering universal access to ART for PLWHA; and to ensuring universal access to services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). The other partner countries are S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Cape Verde, Guinea- Bissau, and East Timor.

According to a population-based survey conducted in Peru‚Äôs 24 largest cities in 2002, adult HIV prevalence was estimated to be less than 1 percent (0.6 percent among pregnant women; 0.4 percent among males; and 0.1 percent among females). The survey demonstrated that cases are unevenly distributed in the country, affecting mostly young people between the ages of 25 and 34. As of July 2010, the cumulative reported number of persons infected with HIV was 41,638, and there were 26,566 cases of AIDS, according to the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the male/female ratio for AIDS diagnoses in 2009 was 3.02 to 1. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates 76,000 Peruvians are HIV-positive, meaning that many people at risk do not know their status. There were 3,300 deaths due to AIDS in Peru in 2007 (UNAIDS, 2008), down from 5,600 deaths in 2005. Among Peru's reported cases of HIV/AIDS, 77 percent are in Lima and Callao ‚Äì the capital city area (United Nations General Assembly Special Session report, 2010). Sexual transmission accounts for the majority (97 percent) of cases, followed by mother-to-child transmission (2 percent), and contaminated blood and blood products (1 percent) (UNGASS, 2010). The prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM), which was 14 percent nationally and 23 percent in Lima in 2005, has continued to rise in recent years, while among sex workers prevalence remains low (0.6 to 2 percent).Sanchez J et al. \\"High HIV and ulcerative transmitted infection incidence estimates among men who have sex with men in Peru: awaiting an effective preventive intervention\\". Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes, 2009, 51(Suppl. 1): S47‚ÄìS51 In five Central American countries, the annual HIV incidence was 5.1% among men who have sex with men, while an incidence of 3.5% has been found among men who have sex with men who attended public health clinics in Lima, Peru. A recent analysis by Alarcon-Villaverde indicated MSM account for a large proportion of HIV incidence (55 percent) in Peru (UNAIDS, 2009). In addition, transsexuals who are sex workers are the most affected population, with an estimated prevalence between 32 percent and 45 percent (UNGASS, 2010). Although 96 percent of female sex workers (FSWs) report having used a condom with their last client (MOH, 2003), the frequency of condom use among male sex workers is only 42 percent (UNGASS 2008). HIV/AIDS incidence in the main prisons in Peru is approximately 1.1 percent (Instituto Nacional Penitenciario [INPE], 2005), and condom use by prison inmates is low (32.8 percent reported in 2004) (INPE, 2005). Blood safety is also a concern. Several reported cases of HIV infection in 2006 and 2007 have been attributed to blood transfusions received through public health services (MOH, 2007). Infections with syphilis, gonorrhea, and Chlamydia in men and women and trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis in women are factors in the increasing risk of HIV transmission in Peru. According to the 2009 Demographic and Health Survey, 14 percent of the women surveyed among those reporting history of sexual intercourse reported having sexually transmitted infection (STI) symptoms. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of STIs is common in Peru. Inadequate and ineffective treatment of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is common. Also of significant concern is the high HIV prevalence among prison inmates. Given the relatively low level of sexual education, limited condom use, and risky sexual behaviors practiced by some subpopulations, including multiple sex partners, there is a significant potential for the further spread of HIV in Peru. According to the 2008 UNGASS report, less than 5 percent of schools offer sex education, including information about HIV (USAID 2010). One study by Klausner and Mendoza (2002) of young people aged 18 to 30 in 34 neighborhoods in Lima, Chiclayo, and Trujillo demonstrated that 18 percent had more than one sex partner in the last year, 8 percent had more than one partner in the last three months, and condom use was low. National response Peru was one of the first countries in Latin America to adopt a syndromic management approach to STIs and offer prophylaxis for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission, although currently PMTCT coverage is only 56 percent, according to the 2010 UNGASS report. Peru's strategy to prevent STIs was called a model for the Andean region, and in 2000, UNAIDS cited Peru's HIV/AIDS prevention program as one of the best in the world. Soon after, however, political turmoil, an economic crisis, and repeated changes in key personnel combined to undermine MOH operations, including the STI program. In a major restructuring of the MOH in 2002 and 2003, several vertical programs, including the National AIDS Program (NAP), were merged. This was accompanied by a reduction in funding and management capacity for AIDS, tuberculosis (TB), child immunization, and other programs. All aspects of the NAP suffered. In 2004, the MOH began reconstituting its HIV/AIDS program, with the goals of limiting the expansion of the epidemic by preventing new infections and providing appropriate and effective care and support to those who have HIV/AIDS. In 2007, a new Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007‚Äì2011 was designed based on evidence-based strategies. Most-at-risk populations (MARPs) were included as one of the most important target populations. The Plan proposed nine strategic objectives, including prevention, care, and policy issues. One strategic objective was the reduction of HIV and STIs among MSM, FSW, and prison inmates. The Plan proposed the following activities: promotion and distribution of condoms, advocacy for promotion and access to services, improvement of STI/HIV services, STI/HIV facilities, treatment of STIs, strengthening the peer- educator strategy, and strengthening community-based organizations of MSM and FSW. Since the plan was designed to guide HIV/STI activities for 2007‚Äì2011, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria projects in Peru (especially the sixth round) used it as a framework for their activities. Public health services are the main source of care for HIV/AIDS and STIs in Peru, most of which are delivered by the MOH, regional health authorities, and the social security system. In coordination with the MOH, other state sectors, such as the Ministry of Education and the Ministry for Women and Social Development, have programs directed at educating and protecting adolescents and children and preventing HIV/AIDS by promoting healthy lifestyles and reducing high-risk behaviors. Education efforts for HIV prevention in schools are being implemented as part of activities financed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Peruvians living with HIV/AIDS are protected by Law 26626, enacted in 1996, which recognizes fundamental rights of autonomy, confidentiality, and nondiscrimination and guarantees provision of medical treatment according to the state's capacity. HIV testing for pregnant women is mandatory where there is a risk (although this is criticized by human rights observers), and the state is required to provide integral care (including treatment) to all people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). According to the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF Towards Universal Access report, only 48 percent of HIV- infected people in need of antiretroviral therapy (ART) were receiving it in 2007. The activities supported by the Global Fund represent a large proportion of the investment in HIV/AIDS in the country, though the Government of Peru is funding most of the costs of procuring antiretroviral drugs. Peru has obtained funding for HIV/AIDS activities through the Global Fund's rounds two, five, and six. The initial activities emphasized the provision of highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), but later projects emphasized prevention. Peru directs more than 5% of its HIV prevention spending toward prevention programmes for men who have sex with men. An opportunity in these prevention efforts is to target HIV positive individuals through internet communication and cell phone messages to support intervention delivery for HIV treatment adherence and prevention of secondary HIV transmission. The Country Coordinating Mechanism (CCM), established for coordinating activities supported by the Global Fund, is the only multisectoral coordinating mechanism in the country. Under the CCM, governmental ministries, organizations of PLWHA and those affected by TB, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based groups, academia, and international organizations oversee and coordinate Peru's response to the epidemic. The CCM steered the development of the Strategic Multisectoral Plan for the Prevention and Control of STI/HIV/AIDS for 2007-2011. There are currently four national organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS in Peru. The group with the largest reported impact of 1,000 people is the Asociaci√≥n Solas y Unidas, which was founded in 1999. Their principal activities include sexual and reproductive health training, gender and leadership for women living with HIV/AIDS, professional training and career support for impoverished women living with HIV/AIDS, education and training for children affected by HIV/AIDS, and nutritional support for low- income families affected by HIV/AIDS (Directory of Associations of People Living with HIV/AIDS, USAID 2004). Also working with these populations are the Alianza en Accion +, Coordinadora Peruana de Personas Viviendo con VIH/SIDA, and GAM Renacer. Overall, the populations these organizations work with have limited access to anti-retroviral therapies, psychosocial support, home-based services, while there is more access to nutritional guidance and TB screening and treatment through the national Ministry of Health health centers. USAID Support Through USAID, Peru received $1.2 million in fiscal year (FY) 2009 for essential HIV/AIDS programs and services. USAID's HIV/AIDS programs in Peru are implemented as part of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan. Thanks to this support, Peru's health indicators-such as life expectancy, fertility rate, and infant and maternal death rates- have improved steadily over the past several decades. However, troubling differences exist, particularly between rural and urban populations, made worse by poverty and low education levels. Also, there remain to be significant challenges associated with enacting successful prevention efforts in Peru, in particular in the rural regions where there is limited access and where some communities do not even have a word for ‚Äòprevention‚Äô.

Kamban is the first and most important sculptor in the Faroe Islands. In 1930 he went to Copenhagen to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts to study painting, but soon changed his direction and attended the School of Sculpture in the Art Academy from 1932 to 1935 and from 1938 to 1940, where he studied under Professor Einar Utzon-Frank. Study tours in the 1930s led him to Paris, Florence, Oslo and Stockholm. In his Copenhagen studio he organized the first exhibition of Faroese Art in Denmark. In addition to his own works, it included works by Gudmund Hentze, S√°mal Joensen-Mikines, Elin Borg L√ºtzen, Ruth Smith and Ingolf Jacobsen. During the Second World War he had to remain in German-occupied Denmark since the Faroe Islands were occupied by Britain. However, in August 1945, Kamban returned to the Faroe Islands on the first ship, the Aarhus. Once there, he immediately established himself as a sculptor. His first monumental work was M√≥√∞urm√°li√∞ (mother tongue), made in 1948 from local basalt, as an anniversary memorial for V U Hammershaimb, 1846, creator of the Faroese written language. This monument is now hidden behind high bushes in T√≥rshavn. However, the bronze bust for the politician and lawyer Niels Winther (1822‚Äì92) is clearly visible at the entrance to the national library, and the 3.8 x 2.9 metre cement relief S√∏guma√∞urin (the storyteller) of 1956 can be seen on the facade of a local school in T√≥rshavn. Other monuments produced by him can be found all over the Faroe Islands, and his subjects are common everyday practical aspects of island life: seamen, islanders, sheep, pilot whales, the Faroese chain dance and so on. He used plaster, cement, baked clay, wood, basalt and bronze. Two of his sculptures, Sheep with two lambs (cement, 1955) and Four whales (1986), are exhibited at the Faroese Art Museum. In addition to his sculptures, he also produced graphics, particularly linocuts, including numerous book illustrations, posters, logos and even three postage stamps. Janus Kamban was one of the founders of the faroese republican party (Tj√≥√∞veldi). He advocated for the secession of the Faroe Islands from Denmark, and the establishment of an independent republic. Being an advocate for self-reliance, self-sufficiency and the development of faroese culture, he also co-founded the faroese artists association Listafelagi√∞. Since 1970 he has lived in a house on the coast (Yviri vi√∞ Strond in T√≥rshavn) with a view to N√≥lsoy, built according to his specifications in the classical style, with black asphalt outside walls and grass roof. At the age of 85, he fell off his bicycle and broke his right hand and it has not healed properly, putting an end to his career as an artist.

However, it has the second most cases in the Caribbean region in total (after Haiti), with an estimated 46,000 HIV/AIDS-positive Dominicans as of 2013 (the Dominican Republic is the second most populated Caribbean nation).http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.AIDS.ZS Prevalence The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reports that some urban areas of the Dominican Republic have HIV/AIDS infection rates well in excess of 10%. In some parts of the Dominican Republic, HIV/AIDS has become one of the leading cause of death among teenagers and adults between 15‚Äì49 years old. Adult women living with HIV/AIDS are estimated at 23,000. HIV prevalence in pregnant women had been relatively stable for a number of years. However, 2005 sentinel surveillance reported HIV prevalence of more than 4.5 percent in pregnant women at two sites. In 2006, sentinel surveillance of pregnant women of all ages reported seroprevalence of 3.4 percent at four sites and 5.9 percent at one site. However, in the Santo Domingo National District, antenatal clinics have noted a decline in prevalence, probably because of a successful prevention campaign. HIV/AIDS was first reported in the Dominican Republic in 1983 and continued spreading until the mid-1990s, when prevalence started to decrease. However, due to sex tourism, child sex tourism, and prostitution in tourism industry workers, spread of the epidemic began to increase again. Heterosexual intercourse reportedly the primary form of transmission of the disease, accounting for 81 percent of HIV infections in 15- to 44-year-olds of both sexes. However, because of strong stigma against homosexuality, it is possible that the number of infections resulting from men having sex with men, or male child prostitutes, may be higher than listed or may simply go unreported. In addition to an increase in sex tourism , the country‚Äôs epidemic is driven by people with multiple sex partners, younger women in union with older men, sex workers and their clients and partners, and men who have sex with men (MSM). According to the 2002 Demographic and Health Survey, 29 percent of men had sex with more than one partner in the preceding 12 months. According to UNAIDS, females under 24 years of age are twice as likely to contract HIV as their male counterparts. This is in part due to young women having relationships with older men, who are more likely to have acquired HIV/AIDS from previous partners or exposure. A sentinel surveillance study in 2006 reported that prevalence among prostitutes, or commercial sex workers (CSWs), is 4.1 percent (2.4 to 6.5 percent, depending on location). In some sites, the prevalence among is declining and equals that of pregnant women. For example, in Santo Domingo, prevalence in sex workers has been decreasing for the last eight years and is reaching the same level as in pregnant women nationally. This may be attributable to the successful implementation of the ‚Äú100% Condom Strategy‚Äù by two nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in several provinces. For example, one community project in Santo Domingo in 2006 demonstrated an increase in condom use among sex workers, from 75 percent to 94 percent in just 12 months. According to the 2005 World Health Organization (WHO)/UNAIDS AIDS Epidemic Update, a 2004 study in Puerto Plata, Samana, and Santo Domingo found that 11 percent of MSM were HIV-positive. Infection levels among sugar cane plantation workers living in communities called bateyes average 5 percent, with some groups as high as 12 percent. According to WHO, the estimated incidence rate of tuberculosis (TB) in the Dominican Republic (40 cases per 100,000 people in 2005) is one of the highest in the Americas. Data on HIV-TB co-infection, albeit limited to certain areas of the country, suggest that 6 to 11 percent of TB patients are infected with HIV. Therefore, the Dominican Republic has the potential for a burgeoning epidemic of TB along with HIV. National HIV-TB guidelines have been recently developed and HIV-TB activities have been included in national plans. While the country has introduced some HIV-TB collaborative activities (e.g., isoniazid prophylaxis for HIV-infected people and provision of antiretroviral therapy [ART]), there are no data on the number of HIV-infected TB patients receiving ART. Factors that put the Dominican Republic at risk of a growing epidemic include early age at sexual debut, high birth rates among adolescent girls and young women, the high TB incidence, and active migration (including migration between cities and countryside, migration from Haiti, and migration to and from the United States). The Dominican Republic‚Äôs popularity as a tourist destination, coupled with increasing levels of sex tourism, also contributes to the spread of HIV. These and other factors suggest the need to target interventions to young adults, provinces with a high rate of tourism, and bateyes.\\"Health Profile: Dominican Republic\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. National response The Government of the Dominican Republic has responded aggressively to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Established in 2000, the Presidential Council on AIDS (COPRESIDA) coordinates the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and STDs 2007‚Äì2015. COPRESIDA‚Äôs activities include implementing public policies, providing care for those living with HIV/AIDS, promoting private sector involvement in response to the epidemic, and reducing stigma and discrimination (S&D;). The Ministry of Health (MOH) implements HIV/AIDS services and diagnostic tests in the public sector. The National AIDS Program (NAP) develops HIV/AIDS-related norms, protocols, and surveillance. National-level government-directed activities include the following: *Conducting information, education, and communication campaigns *Coordinating care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) *Reducing mother-to-child transmission *Ensuring blood supply safety *Monitoring and evaluating national and provincial health plans *Distributing condoms to at-risk individuals Since 1995, an AIDS law has made it illegal to discriminate against PLWHA. The law is unique for the region; however, enforcement is uneven and inconsistent, and S&D; against PLWHA and those engaging in behaviors putting them most at risk for HIV/AIDS are common. The government works with a number of international donors to combat HIV/AIDS, including the William J. Clinton Foundation, UNICEF, the United Nations Population Fund, the World Bank, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. In 2004, the Dominican Republic received a second- round grant from the Global Fund to scale up HIV services throughout the country, with particular focus on vulnerable groups, including female sex workers, MSM, and migrants. With Global Fund support, the government also intends to scale up ART.

Prevalence Overall prevalence has increased since the first case was detected in 1984. Since that time, 18,282 HIV/AIDS cases have been reported in the country. Incidence appears to have declined since 2004, but there is a fear that because of the lack of an effective monitoring system, many HIV/AIDS cases are not reported (according to a UNAIDS May 2006 report, 40 to 50 percent of cases are under-reported). Heterosexual sex is the main route of HIV transmission in El Salvador, accounting for 79 percent of HIV cases in the country. The epidemic is predominantly in urban areas and is becoming increasingly feminized as the percent of women with HIV rises. Although prevalence is 3 percent among sex workers, it is as high as 16 percent in specific areas, such as Puerto de Acajutla. Prevalence is also high among MSM (17.8 percent, the highest in Central America). One study from 2002 reported by UNAIDS in 2007 demonstrated that infection levels among MSM in El Salvador were 22 times higher than among the general population. Moreover, stigma and discrimination (S&D;) against MSM lead to hidden behaviors, and, as a result, there is probably considerable under-reporting of the epidemic among this group. The National AIDS Program (NAP) estimates that 51 percent of reported AIDS cases occur in the 25- to 34-year-old age group. Although estimates vary, about 85 percent of infections are sexually transmitted, of which 4 percent are cases of homosexual transmission and 3 percent bisexual transmission. According to the national sexually transmitted disease (STD) and HIV/AIDS program, the range for new HIV/AIDS infections per day is between 4.5 and 5.5 cases. Mortality due to AIDS represented the seventh-leading cause of death in hospitals for the population as a whole and the leading cause in the 20 to 59 age group. El Salvador contributes 18.4 percent of all cases in the Central America subregion and has the third-largest number of cases behind Honduras and Guatemala. Factors that put El Salvador at risk of a larger epidemic include early initiation of sex, limited knowledge or practice of preventive practices among people engaging in high-risk behaviors, and the country‚Äôs large mobile population. The National Health Survey conducted in 2002 and 2003 indicated that 32 percent of females aged 15 to 19 were already sexually active. Knowledge about HIV/AIDS remains somewhat limited, as evidenced by one multicenter study in which 40 percent of MSM had false beliefs about the modes of transmission of HIV. Among sex workers, an estimated 90 percent do not use condoms with regular partners. Compounding these issues are S&D; toward HIV-infected individuals and at-risk groups, which can deter people from getting tested and receiving adequate support if they have the disease.\\"Health Profile: El Salvador\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. National response Although the Government of El Salvador began initial HIV/AIDS prevention activities as early as 1988, stigma surrounding HIV persists. In 2001, El Salvador passed legislation protecting patients‚Äô rights and guaranteeing access to treatment. El Salvador‚Äôs NAP was established in 1987, and it continues to work closely with various state ministries, civil society, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The country is now implementing its fourth HIV/AIDS strategic plan for 2005 to 2010. The new plan aims to improve the population‚Äôs knowledge about HIV/AIDS, strengthen preventive and protective measures, and extend coverage of HIV/AIDS services for vulnerable groups. Following the worldwide Three Ones principles, El Salvador formed the National AIDS Commission (CONASIDA) to act as the country‚Äôs AIDS coordinating mechanism. One of the achievements of CONASIDA was the development of the 2005 National Policy for Comprehensive HIV Care. Important government activities include signing the Declaration of San Salvador for fighting AIDS in Central America and the Caribbean and the creation of an HIV/AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention program for mobile populations. The latter is particularly important because El Salvador is a corridor for migrants. El Salvador is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006-2015 of the Pan American Health Organization. Free HIV testing began in El Salvador in 1997, and in January 2002, the Ministry of Health (MOH) began to offer antiretroviral treatment (ART). By December 2006, 174 health facilities and two mobile clinics offered HIV testing for free, and 3,447 people were receiving ART without charge. In cooperation with other countries in the region, the Salvadoran Government negotiated with major pharmaceutical manufacturers and received price reductions on antiretroviral drugs. Currently, 39 percent of people infected with HIV who need ART receive it. In 2003, the country began a national program called Make the Decision to Wait to teach adolescents about safer sexual behaviors and to abstain from sex, and in 2005, two major campaigns were launched to combat stigma against people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). President El√≠as Antonio Saca Gonz√°lez declared June 27, 2007, National HIV Testing Day. With the support of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the regional NGO Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO) managed the event‚Äôs publicity campaign. The campaign resulted in 54,461 tests, exceeding the 40,000 target. Nearly three times the normal monthly average of tests done in all of 2006 were conducted on this one day. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is also currently supporting the MOH and the United Nations Development Program to develop a strategy for fighting HIV/AIDS in vulnerable populations to help poverty reduction. Despite these efforts, improved monitoring and surveillance and campaigns to raise awareness are needed.

However, Guatemala ‚Äì Central America‚Äôs largest country ‚Äì accounts for nearly one-sixth of Central America‚Äôs HIV-infected population. Since the country‚Äôs first case of HIV was reported in 1984, infections have occurred primarily among men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers. According to the National AIDS Program (NAP) in the Ministry of Health (MOH), as of April 2007, Guatemala had 10,304 officially reported cases of HIV/AIDS. UNAIDS estimates that 61,000 people are living with HIV in Guatemala and 2,700 deaths have occurred due to AIDS. Guatemala‚Äôs HIV-infected population lives primarily in urban areas along major transportation routes. According to Guatemala‚Äôs 2007 National Epidemiological Center report, more than 77 percent of reported HIV/AIDS cases occurred in seven departments: Suchitep√©quez, Guatemala, Izabal, Escuintla, Retalhuleu, San Marcos, and Quetzaltenango. The NAP estimates that 80 percent of reported HIV cases have occurred among 15- to 49-year-olds, with 20- to 34-year-olds accounting for more than 51 percent of all cases. National HIV prevalence among sex workers is 4 percent, and among street-based female sex workers prevalence is as high as 12 percent. National HIV prevalence among MSM is 10 percent, but in Guatemala City, 18 percent of MSM were HIV-positive in 2006, according to baseline data collected for a Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria project. A 2002 study published by UNAIDS in 2007 showed that infection levels among MSM in Guatemala is 10 times higher than in the adult general population. Other vulnerable populations include prison inmates, with a reported prevalence of 3.2 percent, and at-risk youth and street children, with HIV prevalence at 3.3 percent. According to the MOH, no cases of infection have been reported among injecting drug users or through blood or blood products. Available data indicate that HIV has affected mainly urban and Ladino (mixed Amerindian- Spanish peoples) populations; however, preliminary data indicate that the indigenous population (primarily Mayans) potentially could be experiencing increasing HIV infections. The data are insufficient, however, to determine the extent of the epidemic within this population. Several risk factors contribute to Guatemala‚Äôs epidemic, including migration and tourism. While in transit, migrants may participate in high-risk sexual behavior, increasing their chances of becoming infected with HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The Garifuna population, which shares cultural and ethnic characteristics with the Caribbean countries, is more at risk than the general population. The effects of HIV/AIDS are exacerbated by high levels of poverty and limited access to health care, particularly among rural populations. The rate of HIV co-infection with tuberculosis (TB) is growing. The current rate of new TB infections is 34 per 100,000 people and a 2006 study cited by UNAIDS found that HIV prevalence among new TB patients in Quetzaltenango tripled from 4.2 to 12 percent between 1995 and 2002. TB is the most frequent opportunistic infection associated with HIV/AIDS in Guatemala.\\"Health Profile: Guatemala\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. National response According to the 2003 AIDS Program Effort Index, a tool developed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to measure the collective effort put into an effective HIV/AIDS response by individuals and domestic and international organizations, Guatemala had a score of 52, which is an improvement from the score in 1996 but still slightly lower than the average score of 55 for Latin America and the Caribbean region. It ranked highest in the areas of political support and prevention programs. The NAP has been responsible for surveillance of the epidemic since 1984. However, sentinel surveillance was not established until 1998. Over the past several years, the Guatemalan government has taken concrete steps to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. A national strategic plan was produced for 1999 to 2003. At the end of 2005, Guatemala adopted a new national HIV/AIDS policy, along with a new strategic plan for 2006 to 2010. The plan charges the NAP with coordinating national responses, including those from civil society. UNAIDS works with the NAP, and USAID provides technical assistance to implement the national strategic plan and establish key universal access targets. Decentralization of AIDS care and prevention services throughout the country is an important priority. In recent years, the NAP has improved communication with civil society and other institutions to coordinate national efforts. This has resulted in the establishment of NAP-led technical committees with multisectoral participation to address such issues as standardizing diagnosis, treatment, and care. Moreover, the Country Coordination Mechanism serves as an inter-institutional coordinating body, aimed at better implementing Global Fund projects. Guatemala is also implementing the Regional HIV/STI Plan for the Health Sector 2006‚Äì2015 of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). The Plan is designed to assist health services and systems in the Americas to more effectively respond to the HIV epidemic and prevent STIs. Antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage has expanded over the years, and currently, 76 percent of identified HIV-infected men and women who need treatment receive ART, according to the NAP. The recent WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report Towards Universal Access estimates that 52 percent of HIV-infected people who need treatment receive ART. However, because the expansion and decentralization of services has been slow, people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) must travel long distances to obtain treatment, imposing cost burdens on them. There are major challenges in extending both prevention and care coverage outside the capital and other main cities. Furthermore, discrimination against PLWHA and vulnerable groups such as commercial sex workers and MSM remains a significant barrier to a more effective AIDS response in Guatemala. USAID has supported a national campaign focusing on the diversity of PLWHA to help break down barriers of stigma and discrimination (S&D;) and promote respect for human rights related to HIV/AIDS. Guatemala receives significant support from the Global Fund to expand prevention, care, and treatment activities among vulnerable groups and in priority geographic areas of the country. The objectives of the Global Fund are to expand prevention activities and ART services from the capital city to regions with the highest HIV incidence; to improve coordination among civil society organizations working in HIV/AIDS; and to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV by expanding voluntary screening and counseling for pregnant women. Bilateral donors, including USAID and European countries, also provide support for prevention, treatment, care, and health system improvement initiatives.

It is located in the village of Kalv√•g, on the southern coast of the small island of Fr√∏ya. It is the church for the Fr√∏ya parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1865. The architect was the painter artist Anders Askevold from nearby Askvoll municipality. The church seats about 400 people. The church was consecrated on 11 December 1865 by the local dean Johan Carl Christie. The church building was remodeled in 1933, 1940, and 1961. The altarpiece dates back to 1720 when it was used in the old church, located in Grotle (just west of the village of Bremanger). History The parish of Bremanger had a church at Grotle on the island of Bremangerlandet, just west of the main village of Bremanger for many hundreds of years. It was decided to move the location of the Bremanger parish church from Grotle to the village of Kalv√•g, about to the south, since it would be more centrally located within the parish. So, the aging church at Grotle was torn down and the new church in Kalv√•g was completed in 1865. The new church at Kalv√•g carried over the old Bremanger Church name to this new church site, since it was the main church for the Bremanger parish. Later, in 1908, a new chapel was built in the village of Bremanger, but that was named Bremangerpollen Chapel. This caused some controversy since Bremanger Church was located in Kalv√•g (not Bremanger village). In 1952, after the church at Bremanger village had existed for 37 years, a change of names was finally decided. The church on the island of Fr√∏ya was named Fr√∏ya Church, and Bremangerpollen Chapel was given the name Bremanger Church.

As of 1998, Honduras had the highest prevalence of HIV out of all seven Central American countries according to a study published by the office of the Honduran Secretary of Public Health. As of that same year, Hondurans made up only 17% of the Central American population, yet Honduras contained 50% of the initial AIDS cases in Central America and 60% of all Central American cases in 2001. In more recent years, new HIV infections have decreased by 29% since 2010 while AIDS-related deaths have increased by 11% since then. HIV/AIDS heavily affects the young, active, working population in Honduras, and HIV/AIDS deaths account for 10% of the overall national mortality rate. As of 2008, AIDS was the leading cause of death among Honduran women of childbearing age and the second-leading cause of hospitalization among both men and women. Sexually transmitted infections are common, and condom use in risky sexual encounters is sporadic and variable.\\"Health Profile: Honduras\\" . United States Agency for International Development (March 2005). Accessed September 7, 2008. HIV remains a mainly heterosexual epidemic in Honduras, as 90% of emerging infections are attributed to heterosexual transmission. It is estimated that the prevalence of HIV among Honduran adults is 1.5%.  First cases  According to a 1998 report released by the office of the Honduran Secretary of Public Health, the incubation period, during which HIV/AIDS was first introduced into the Honduran population without being recognized, is estimated to have been during the end of the 1970s and into the early 1980s. In 1984, the first case of HIV/AIDS in Honduras was identified in a man who reported having travelled to San Francisco multiple times in the years preceding his diagnosis, which was confirmed in 1985 when he tested positive for Kaposi's sarcoma and antibodies for HIV. Four men, all reporting having traveled outside of the country, constituted the first cases recognized in Honduras. Three of those men were likely to have contracted HIV from homosexual transmission, while one contracted the virus likely from heterosexual transmission. By 1992, the 100 Honduran cases of HIV/AIDS included almost every risk group associated with HIV/AIDS: men who have sex with men (MSM), men who have sex with men and women (MSM/W), commercial sex workers, children of HIV-positive mothers, intravenous drug users, and blood transfusion recipients. Since spreading to other populations, HIV/AIDS is considered to be transmitted mainly heterosexually in Honduras and thought to have been introduced to the heterosexual population through bisexual transmission. Additionally, groups such as marines and soldiers, who have increased interaction with the exterior and are also more likely to have multiple sexual partners, contributed to the spread of HIV/AIDS throughout Honduras. A 1997 study found prevalence of 6.8% among military recruits. Prevalence and causes  Geographical predominance  Map of Honduras, delineating its departments, and its capital Tegucigalpa The areas most heavily affected by HIV/AIDS cases tend to be within what is called the Central Corridor of Development (Corridor Central de Desarrollo), affecting urban areas such as Tegucigalpa, San Pedro Sula, La Ceiba, El Progreso, Comayagua, Puerto Cort√©s, Tela, La Lima, and Choluteca. The disease originated in the northern part of the country, with especially high rates in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, which was the original epicenter of the disease. In San Pedro Sula, rates of HIV prevalence were estimated to be as high as 14 to 21% of the population at the height of the epidemic in Honduras. HIV/AIDS has since spread to the south, east, and west of Honduras, including the Honduran Bay Islands in the Caribbean, though these regions were affected later. Municipalities with the highest reported incidences of HIV infection are found on the border with neighboring countries El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. On the northern coast of Honduras, the Gar√≠funa minority group experiences particularly high rates of HIV prevalence.  Demographical predominance  HIV/AIDS has most affected young people in Honduras, ranging from 20 to 39 years of age. The main risk groups associated with HIV/AIDS in Honduras are female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), the Gar√≠funa community, prisoners, and transgender women. The United Nations Joint Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS) released the following statistics regarding the HIV prevalence among different risk groups in Honduras: * 5.3% among sex workers * 11.7% among gay men and men who have sex with men * 11.9% among transgender people Additionally, prevalence rates among prisoners have been found to be as high as 7.6%. In 2005 the national prevalence among sex workers was 9.68% according to a UNAIDS document on CONASIDA. 47% of the cases of HIV recorded in 2004 were women, and in that same year around 0.5% of women in antenatal surveillance studies were HIV positive. Overall, women account for more of emerging infections than men do.  Proposed national causes  While it is not known exactly why the epidemic in Honduras became so severe, some experts, such as epidemiologists like Manuel Sierra, attribute its severity to the long incubation period of the disease in the country. Other reasons to which specialists attribute the state of the Honduran epidemic include increased international military presence due to the Cold War, during which Honduras experienced an influx of both international military personnel and also contras from neighboring Nicaragua, who helped to stimulate the commercial sex industry on a national level. Among the Gar√≠funa The Gar√≠funa, of Afro- Caribbean descent, are one of at least eight minority groups within Honduras and one of the few for which HIV prevalence rates are known. Heterosexual transmission rates among the Gar√≠funa are comparable to those of sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2005, the prevalence of HIV among the Gar√≠funa was estimated to be somewhere between 8 and 14% of this population. Among this population, condom use was reported in 2009 to be only 10.6% in stable couples and 41.4% in casual couples. HIV was higher among Gar√≠funas residing in urban areas. In addition to low condom use and urban living, researchers suggest that the high rates of HIV prevalence may be due to the migratory working patterns of Gar√≠funa men, who often travel seasonally to the United States or cities, such as San Pedro Sula where HIV prevalence is particularly high, for their jobs in shipping and fishing. Other possible contributing factors are sexual violence, the inability of women to control their sexual experiences, multiple sex partners, remuneration received for sex, with 6% of subjects reporting having received money for sex in a 2009 study, and first sexual encounters for men at 15 and women at 17. Prevalence among Gar√≠funa was 3.8% among men and 5.1% among women as of 2006, indicating rates more than three times those of the national average. In a 2015 study, men were found to be more than four times as likely to have had multiple sex partners within the last 12 months than women. Gar√≠funa women remain an especially disenfranchised group and have been subject to treatment methods as radical as forced sterilization. Only 9% of Gar√≠funa men were reported to have been circumcised, which is proven to be a successful method at lowering risk of HIV contraction through heterosexual transmission by as much as 60%. High rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis and herpes (HSV-2) were also found among the Gar√≠funa in a 2009 study, and high rates of other STIs are linked to a higher risk of HIV infection. Although traditional health care is available to some within this community, the Gar√≠funa have also developed their own methods of educating their community and spreading knowledge of prevention: utilizing their traditional musical forms to accompany informational plays about HIV/AIDS. Organizations, such as the Pan American Social Marketing Organization (PASMO), have adopted similar education tactics, such as bingo games in which each space on a playing card contains a picture of HIV/AIDS or another STD. National response  Early response  National efforts to reduce the number of new HIV infections have been in place since the late 1980s. The national response to HIV/AIDS has been led by the Ministry of Health, with collaboration from other ministries and several nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The Health Secretariat solidified the creation of the National AIDS Control Program (PNS) between 1989 and 1994 in an effort to improve health infrastructure, create a national counseling network, and standardize treatment for Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS. During this same time period, the National AIDS Commission (COMSIDA) was also founded. Since the beginning of its involvement in preventing the spread of HIV, the Honduran government has sought to establish multi-sector programs, such as COMSIDA, which was reorganized in 1999 into CONASIDA, with fifteen national institutions or organizations represented. Similarly, the Strategic Plan for the Fight Against AIDS, in place from 1998 to 2002, included the response capabilities of both governmental and nongovernmental bodies and organizations. By the beginning of the 1990s, blood began to be screened for HIV on a national scale in Honduras, five years after the US began screening blood donations. HIV/AIDS cases due to blood transfusions began to decrease by 1991.  Recent response and current policies  HIV/AIDS was declared a national priority between 2002 and 2006 under President Ricardo Maduro, who publicly committed himself to support the national response to HIV/AIDS and identified HIV/AIDS as one of five health issues to receive priority government attention. Current programs focus on prevention, education, comprehensive care, and the rights of HIV-positive people. Prevention efforts, executed among various governmental and nongovernmental organizations like NGOs, churches, and schools, have specifically targeted groups especially at risk for HIV/AIDS, such as sex workers, members of the gay and lesbian community, mobile populations, and members of the Gar√≠funa ethnic population. In the education system, teachers were trained in 2005 to educate their students about reproductive health, STIs, and HIV/AIDS, and these topics have become integrated into the national curriculum in Honduran schools. Despite these education and awareness efforts, in 2013, still around half of Hondurans infected were unaware they were living with HIV. Honduras‚Äôs long-term plan is to prevent new infections and to provide services to those who are most at risk for HIV infection, including young people, sex workers, men who have sex with men, institutionalized persons, and the Gar√≠funa ethnic group. In 2017, the Ministry of Health resolved to cover all treatment for those living with HIV, regardless of CD4 count, and internal funding covers 95% and 70% of treatment costs and preventative efforts respectively.  International response and aid  The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malariahas disbursed US$90,720,054 of the US$96,502,161 originally signed to Honduras for HIV/AIDS programs alone. According to USAIDS, another international body that supports programs addressing HIV/AIDS in Honduras, Global Fund programs have three main goals: to promote the protection of the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), create awareness surrounding risks and risk-reducing measures among particularly vulnerable populations, and make health services more accessible to these populations. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has been another significant supporter of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care in Honduras. Other international bodies that have assisted programs in Honduras include the Swedish International Development Agency, Canadian International Development Agency, Department for International Development (United Kingdom), Humanist Institute for Development Cooperation, Christian Aid, Catholic Relief Services, German Cooperation Agency, Cooperative for American Relief Everywhere, Inc. (CARE), and the Red Cross. USAID programs include partnership directly with the Honduran government through projects such as AIDSTAR-One (AIDS Support and Technical Assistance Resources) but also include funding of individual, local organizations and NGOs, such as Fundaci√≥n para el Fomento en Salud. Doctors Without Borders (Medecins sans Frotieres) has also been active in the country since 1974. Their HIV/AIDS programs in Honduras focus on antenatal care and their servicio prioritario, or priority service, which consists of free and confidential post-exposure prophylaxis and psychological counseling to rape victims. As of 2017, Doctors Without Borders had provided 2,300 mental health consultations, 6,800 antenatal consultations, 800 postnatal consultations, assisted in 400 births, and treated 600 patients after experiences of sexual violence.  Access to ARV treatment  Antiretroviral therapy was only offered in the Honduran public health system as of 2002. In 2001, 18 million lempiras were allocated to the purchase of ART in 2002, and the Honduran government aims to achieve universal ART access. Currently, the Honduran government spends 40 million lempiras annually to provide this treatment. In 2005, it was estimated that 4,500 people were receiving ART treatment, but CONASIDA estimated that only one-third of people with advanced HIV were actually receiving their drugs. Beyond simply providing the antiretroviral drugs themselves, programs such as the Inter-institutional Alliance for the Improved Nutrition of People Living with HIV/AIDS (IMANAS) have attempted to alleviate among households receiving ART the added stressor of lack of food, which can negatively impact people's ability to adhere to their ART regimens. Despite these efforts, in a study published in 2011, researchers found that 87% of households receiving ART in Honduras were food insecure, which was reflected by the 15% of these households in which ART adherence was inadequate. In 2013, 42% of people were still accessing health care and receiving treatment after 12 months, and one in three patients had reached an undetectable viral load. As of 2016, 51% of Honduras affected by HIV/AIDS were able to receive antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 54% of HIV-positive pregnant women were receiving treatment or had utilized prophylaxis as a means of prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT). As of 2018, a total of 12,789 individuals were reported to be receiving ART, according to El Heraldo.  Activism  The Special Law on HIV/AIDS, passed by Congress and allowing CONASIDA to be formed in order to protect the rights of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS, is attributed greatly to activism on the part of Hondurans living with HIV/AIDS and civil society workers in a 2005 special report created for the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS.  Honduran National Association of People Living with HIV (Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Honduras de Personas que Viven con el VIH)  The Honduran National Association of People Living with HIV, in part facilitated by USAID funds, has served to empower those in Honduras living with HIV/AIDS and was established to protect their human rights. It was founded by Allan Dunaway, who also served as its president and give a face to HIV/AIDS in Honduras and essentially all of Latin America, as he was one of the first Latin American HIV/AIDS activists. He and his wife, Rosa Gonz√°lez, were the first couple to publicly reveal their HIV-positive status. Together, they also founded Fundaci√≥n Llaves, and Dunaway worked directly with the National Commission of Human Rights (Comisionado Nacional de los Derechos Humanos). Representing their organization, Dunaway and his wife also traveled to the International AIDS Conference in New York City in 2008.

The human homolog (DHH) is on chromosome band 12q13.1. The protein encoded by this gene is involved in cell signaling. The several mammalian variants of the Drosophila hedgehog gene (which was the first named) have been named after the various species of hedgehog; the desert hedgehog is honored by this one. The gene is not specific to desert hedgehogs.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the hedgehog family. The hedgehog gene family encodes signaling molecules that play an important role in regulating morphogenesis. This protein is predicted to be made as a precursor that is autocatalytically cleaved; the N-terminal portion is soluble and contains the signalling activity while the C-terminal portion is involved in precursor processing. More importantly, the C-terminal product covalently attaches a cholesterol moiety to the N-terminal product, restricting the N-terminal product to the cell surface and preventing it from freely diffusing throughout the organism.  Clinical Significance  Defects in this protein have been associated with partial gonadal dysgenesis (PGD) accompanied by minifascicular polyneuropathy. This protein may be involved in both male gonadal differentiation and perineurial development.

Prevalence Recent data from high-risk groups suggest that at least 9 percent of commercial sex workers and 20 to 30 percent of men who have sex with men (MSM) are estimated to be HIV-positive. Men and women aged 20 to 39 account for 54 percent of reported AIDS cases in Jamaica. First detected in 1982, HIV is present in all of Jamaica‚Äôs parishes, but Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. James ‚Äì the three most urbanized parishes ‚Äì have the majority of cases, but St James being the highest overall. UNAIDS estimates that 25,000 people in Jamaica are HIV-infected. The primary contributors to the epidemic are sociocultural, behavioral, and economic factors that result in risky behaviors such as multiple sex partners, older men having sex with younger women, and early sexual debut. A 2004 Behavioral Surveillance Survey demonstrated that 89 percent of males and 78 percent of females aged 15 to 24 had sex with a nonmarital or noncohabitating partner in the preceding 12 months (2006). Fifty-six percent of males and 16 percent of females had multiple sex partners in the preceding 12 months. Among patients attending sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics in Kingston, St. Andrew, and St. James, HIV infection rates reached 5 percent. In the general population, overall AIDS case rates among men continue to exceed the rates among women. However, surveillance data, as presented by Dr. Peter Figueroa of Jamaica‚Äôs Ministry of Health (MOH) at the U.S. Government-sponsored sixth annual Caribbean U.S. Chiefs of Mission Conference on HIV/AIDS held in Jamaica in October 2007, indicate that adolescent females (10 to 19 years old) are 2.7 times more likely to be infected than same-age males. Young women are particularly at risk because they find it difficult to negotiate whether and when to have sex and how to protect themselves from pregnancy and disease. For example, the ‚Äúsugar daddy‚Äù phenomenon, in which young women and girls exchange sex with older men for material or financial gain, is common. In addition, gender inequality, high levels of unemployment, persistent poverty, rising crime and violence, population mobility, and the growing commercial sex trade ‚Äì including sex tourism ‚Äì compound the country‚Äôs vulnerability to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Although Jamaica has a well-established national surveillance system, collecting accurate data about at-risk groups is challenging. Despite some progress in reducing stigma and discrimination (S&D;), homosexual behavior continues to be illegal in Jamaica, and many MSM hide their sexual orientation and behavior, impeding accurate health surveys. Recent program estimates indicate that 20 to 30 percent of MSM are HIV-positive. Jamaica also has a large number of mobile sex workers, both Jamaican and from outside Jamaica, who are difficult to monitor. HIV infection rates among sex workers are much higher than they are in the general population. A 2006 study of female sex workers, reported by UNAIDS, showed an HIV prevalence of 9 percent in this group. However, according to Jamaica‚Äôs 2006 UNGASS report, an earlier study found a 20 percent prevalence rate among sex workers in the tourist areas of Montego Bay. The actual prevalence of HIV may be higher in these groups as data collection remains difficult and is limited by sampling methods. Sex workers who were older, less educated, and used crack cocaine were more likely to be HIV-infected. According to UNICEF/Jamaica, in 2003, there were 5,125 children in Jamaica who had lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS, and thousands more were estimated to have been made vulnerable by the disease. Poverty and neglect have led to a growing number of street and working children. There were 5,143 children in institutional care in 2003, including those in foster care. Controlling new tuberculosis (TB) infections in Jamaica remains a challenge; the incidence rate is 3 per 100,000 people. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), the prevalence of HIV among Jamaican TB patients is 26 percent. This figure is similar to other developing countries. However, Jamaica has a higher mortality rate among those who are co-infected, so prompt diagnosis of HIV infection and early institution of active antiretroviral treatment (ART) are imperative.\\"Health Profile: Jamaica\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. National response The Government of Jamaica has aggressively addressed the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1988, when it established the National HIV/Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention and Control Program and the National AIDS Committee (NAC), a nongovernmental organization (NGO). The Program, working under the MOH, facilitates governmental cooperation with the private sector and NGOs in the fight against HIV/AIDS. NAC, which has more than 100 member organizations, coordinates the national response to the epidemic. During the past two decades, Jamaica has taken several steps to combat HIV/AIDS. More recent efforts include joining the Pan Caribbean Partnership Against HIV/AIDS upon its formation in 2001 and continuing to serve as an active member; developing an HIV/AIDS prevention and control project; implementing two national strategic plans on HIV/AIDS and STIs, the most recent of which ended in 2006, and launching a new plan in 2007; providing ART for persons with advanced HIV and HIV-infected mothers since 2004; adopting a national HIV/AIDS policy in 2005; and establishing a private sector-led business coalition on HIV in 2006. The government recently began implementing its third National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS/STIs, covering 2007 to 2011. The Plan focuses on achieving universal access to prevention, treatment, and care and support. Currently, only 56 percent of HIV-infected people who need treatment receive ART, according to a WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report. In July 2007, the World Bank announced that it would work with Jamaica to design a second HIV/AIDS prevention and control project to be implemented after the current project closes in May 2008. In 2004, Jamaica‚Äôs MOH received a third-round grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to strengthen multisectoral national activities to prevent and address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. This has been done through scaling up efforts to: *Provide ART to children and adults living with HIV/AIDS *Promote safer sex practices, including abstinence, especially among subpopulations and marginalized groups who tend to be the most vulnerable *Complete and implement policies and a legislative framework specifically addressing S&D; aimed at people living with HIV/AIDS and vulnerable high-risk groups Jamaica has applied to the Global Fund for a 2007 $44.2 million grant to consolidate existing gains while scaling up efforts to provide universal access to HIV treatment, care, and prevention, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations. Jamaica had already received $16.4 million from the Global Fund during round three for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and policy efforts.

In the first decade of the 18th century, he was employed in the Netherlands and associated with Friedrich of Hesse-Cassel, Henri√´tte Amalia van Anhalt-Dessau (daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and widow of Henry Casimir II, Prince of Nassau- Dietz) and her son John William Friso, Prince of Orange.Lasocki In the second decade of the 18th century, Schickhardt lived in Hamburg, where it is speculated by musicologist Andrew D. McCredie that he was a member of the Hamburg Opera in G√§nsemarkt as a flutist or oboist.Lasocki There is evidence suggesting that, in the 1720s, Schickhardt could have been an occasional oboist with the court orchestra of Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then, employer of Johann Sebastian Bach.Lasocki By the 1740s, records place Schickhardt at the University of Leiden as a student, and at his death in 1762, the university described him as \\"a master of musical arts and a member of the Academy,\\" although there is no surviving record of his musical activity in Leiden otherwise.Lasocki Works In the first half of the 18th century, numerous works of his, mostly chamber music featuring the treble recorder, appeared in print from publishers Estienne Roger and Le C√®ne in Amsterdam. At least 30 sets of musical works are known to have been published, some of which are no longer extant. A catalog of Schickhardt's published and manuscript works can be found in David Lasocki's article. With the revival of the treble recorder in the early 20th century, a great interest in suitable repertoire for the instrument developed and some of Schickhardt's works were republished in new editions. It is predominantly through his works for recorder that Schickhardt is known today. Schickhardt's compositions include sonatas for solo recorder and basso continuo (op. 1, op. 17 and op. 23) as well as trio sonatas for two recorders and basso continuo (op. 16). Besides these, there are also compositions that stand between the chamber and larger scale concert music styles, e.g., his op. 19, 6 concertos (C,d,G,F,e,c) for four recorders and basso continuo and his six sonatas (Op. 22) for 2 recorders, oboe, and basso continuo. Some short works by Schickhardt can also be found in The Compleat Tutor to the Hautboy, an oboe tutor published by Walsh and Hare about 1715.Lasocki Additionally, Schickhardt wrote a recorder concerto in G minor and L'Alphabet de la musique (op. 30, c. 1735), which contains sonatas in all 24 keys.L'Alphabet de la musique, Diapason Press List of worksOn the basis of Lasocki, David.

This low prevalence has been maintained, as in 2006, the HIV prevalence in Mexico was estimated at around 0.3% as well. The infected population is remains mainly concentrated among high risk populations, MSM, intravenous drug users, and commercial sex workers. This low national prevalence is not reflected in the high-risk populations. The prison population in Mexico, faces a fairly similar low rate of around 0.7%. Among the population of prisoners, around 2% are known to be infected with HIV. Sex workers, male and female, face an HIV prevalence of around 7%. Identifying gay men and MSM have a prevalence of 17.3%. The highest risk-factor group is identifying transgender people; about 17.4% of this population is known to be infected with HIV. Around 90% of new infections occur by sex-related methods of transmission. . Of these known infected populations, around 60% of living infected people are known to be on anti- retroviral therapy (ART). Transmission Vectors Men who have sex with men (MSM) The AIDS epidemic is concentrated primarily among MSM, sex workers and their clients, and intravenous drug users. Results of a 2006 study by Bravo-Garcia et al. reported by UNAIDS indicate that sex between men accounts for 57 percent of the HIV infections. Mexico's National Center for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control (CENSIDA) estimates that HIV prevalence among MSM was 10 to 13.5 percent in 2006. Results from studies in 2006 by Gayet et al., Magis et al., and the Biological Behavioral Surveillance Survey conducted in Mexico showed that HIV prevalence rates among male sex workers were 25 percent in Monterrey, 20 percent in Guadalajara and Mexico City, and 12 percent in Ciudad Nezahualc√≥yotl.[1] Intravenous Drug Users (IDUs) A gradual shift is occurring toward higher rates of infection among both injecting drug users (IDUs) and women, and rates are also rising among female sex workers (FSWs). A 2004‚Äì2006 study by Patterson et al. in 2006 showed that HIV prevalence in Tijuana and Ciudad Ju√°rez, cities on the U.S. border, was 6 percent among FSWs and 16 percent among IDUs. Research by Gayet et al. in 2006 also showed that HIV prevalence among male long-distance truck drivers in Monterrey was 0.7 percent (double the estimated national adult HIV prevalence). More than one-quarter of them had paid for sex in the previous year and one-sixth of them had never used a condom. The role of IDUs in Mexico's epidemic is difficult to determine, but an association with drug use has been observed in cities along the border with the United States, where the spread of HIV through the sharing of drug-injecting equipment is of growing concern.  Population Mobility  Population mobility is a factor in HIV/AIDS transmission in Mexico. Though the overall infection prevalence is relatively low nationwide, the prevalence of HIV in border cities is disproportionately higher. Border cities, such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez are major sites of drug trafficking, sex trafficking, and commercial sex work and tourism. About 90% of the methamphetamine and 30% of the heroin in the United States was made in Mexico and smuggled in through the border. Cross- border activity, including immigration from Central America and the influx of those returning from migrant work in the United States, has contributed to the spread of the epidemic, particularly in rural parts of the country. Mobile populations are at higher risk of HIV infection because of poverty, violence, lack of access to health services, increased risk-taking behavior, rape, loneliness, and the availability of sex workers.[2] Migrant work between the United States and Mexico has been common among Mexican workers searching for seasonal work, often in agriculture. The wealth disparity that exists between Mexico and the United States creates an economy between the two countries in which large numbers of Mexican workers are constantly seeking work on the other side of the border due to economic and political instability in the Mexican government. In Mexico in particular, the income gap that exists between the upper and lower classes is severe, and issues of poverty plague areas throughout the country. In general, there are large concentrations of high-risk populations moving to and from the border cities of Mexico and the United States. \\"Tijuana and San Diego share the busiest land-border crossing in the world, with 45.9 million northbound legal border crossings in 2006 alone. Considerable bidirectional mobility exists among high-risk populations at this international border crossing.\\" Heterosexual Transmission Although the epidemic in Mexico remains concentrated, it could become generalized due to high-risk behaviors in the general population. There are signs that heterosexual transmission of HIV is increasing as more women are being infected. According to a recent population-based survey by the National Council for HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, in 2001, 15 percent of married and cohabitating men reported extrarelational sex during the last year, and only 9 percent of them used a condom at last intercourse. Eighty percent of these men perceived no HIV risk from their behavior. Mexican women are at risk for HIV infection because they often are unable to negotiate condom use. In Mexican culture, machismo and traditional values, in which women are subservient to the men in their lives, places women in inferior positions in society. According to published research by Olivarrieta and Sotelo (1996) and others, the prevalence of domestic violence in Mexico varies between 30 and 60 percent. In this context, requesting condom use with a stable partner is perceived as a sign of infidelity and asking to use a condom can result in domestic violence.[2] Urban Concentration HIV infection in Mexico is concentrated in urban areas, where more than 77 percent of the population lives. Most HIV prevention programs focus on urban populations, though there are efforts to reach out to rural, mobile, and indigenous populations. Tuberculosis Co-infection The potential for HIV-tuberculosis (TB) co- infection is also a concern in Mexico, as it is in other countries. Studies have shown TB to be the second most frequent infection in AIDS patients in Mexico. It is more prevalent in urban centers among IDUs and individuals of lower socioeconomic status. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of TB is 10 per 100,000 and 1.1 percent of adults newly diagnosed with TB were found to be HIV-positive in 2006.[2] Tuberculosis co- infection is known to be the leading killer of all AIDS-related diseases in the world. (cite) Both tuberculosis and HIV suppress the immune system in complex ways that are still not completely known to the medical community. When the two infect the body together, oftentimes the infections will exacerbate each other, making treatment more complicated. Border Cities Commercial Sex Workers According to studies, the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers (FSWs) in Mexican border cities has increased within the last decade. In a study conducted in Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez, 55 out of 924, 6%, female sex workers tested positive for HIV. The average age of the FSWs was 32, only about 19% spoke English, and the majority of them had little to no education. Among female sex workers in border cities, exposure to and use of intravenous drugs with clients greatly increases risk of HIV infection. \\"FSWs who used stimulants had greater odds of HIV infection, even if they did not inject. Injection drug use and sex work have been shown to overlap considerably in various settings\\". IDUs Mexico's border cities account for the majority of intravenous drugs, methamphetamine and heroine, that are trafficked into the United States. Much of the cities, economy is an informal one, made up of different groups, all contributing to the drug trade. These groups include, gangs, drug dealers, corrupt police, corrupt government officials, immigrants who traffic the drugs across the border on foot, and sex workers, who by way of their clients, are indirectly involved. As a result of this informal economy dominating the cities and corrupting municipal processes, rates of intravenous drug usage is atypically high. The urban poor in Mexico is often exacerbated due to high unemployment rates and lack of stability in government resources. Involvement in the informal economy is oftentimes unavoidable for many, especially those who are impoverished. In border cities, a great majority of the urban poor is made up of men and women who were living in the United States in an undocumented state and have since been deported, sometimes multiple times, and are ostracized from their families and jobs in the United States. Many of these deportees were forced to leave the United States with little notice, without any money or belongings, and no resources or plans to rely on when they are displaced back into Mexico. As a result, many of these deportees are forced to find work wherever possible, without any resources or aid from the United States or Mexican government. Many are forced to resort to commercial sex work or drug trafficking, therefore, increasing the high risk populations that exist. Discrimination Another challenge Mexico currently faces is unequal access to quality care and the need to train health workers and clinics in using antiretroviral treatment (ART).[2]The spread of HIV/AIDS in Mexico is exacerbated by stigma and discrimination (S&D;), which act as a barrier to prevention, testing, and treatment. The 2001 UNGASS declaration stated that \\"stigma, silence, discrimination and denial, together with lack of confidentiality, weaken the prevention efforts, care and treatment.\\" S&D; occur within families, health services, the police, and the workplace. A study conducted by Infante-Xibille in 2004 of 373 health care providers in three states in Mexico described discrimination within health services. HIV testing was conducted only with perceived high-risk groups, often without informed consent. Patients with AIDS were often isolated. A 2005 five-city participatory community assessment by Colectivo Sol, a nongovernmental organization (NGO), found that some HIV hospital patients had a sign over their beds stating they were HIV-positive. There was also discrimination in the workplace. In Le√≥n, Guanajuato, researchers found that seven out of 10 people in the study had lost their jobs because of their HIV status. The same study also documented evidence of discrimination that MSM experienced within their families.[2] National response Condonetas In response to the fact that less than 46% of men who have sex with men and less than 41% of intravenous drug users in Tijuana having reported taking an HIV test, the Federal Ministry of Health, implemented an outreach program known as condonetas in several cities to improve prevention tactics. Condonetasare mobile clinics, or vans, that drive around and hand out various resources to high risk communities to educate individuals about their risks and directly give them assistance. Condonetas are equipped with fast response HIV tests, condoms, clean needles, alcohol wipes, and bottles of bleach to clean the needles if they are going to be shared. These mobile clinics are brightly decorated, adorned with cartoon condoms, and loud speakers. In essence, condonetas are attempting to go against the conservatism of Mexican societal norms and bring sex education to the people instead of allowing them to remain uninformed and at risk. \\"Health officials say this year in Tijuana alone, the condonetas will hand out more than one-million condoms, and more than 50,000 clean syringes.\\" Government Recognition Mexico has a national policy on HIV/AIDS treatment and has made notable gains in providing access to ART for the infected population. Since 2003, Mexico has been providing universal access to ART through the national health system. Although the WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF report Towards Universal Access states that 76 percent of HIV-infected people who needed it were receiving ART in December 2006, the government indicates that everyone identified with advanced disease is receiving treatment. Mexico was also successful in securing the blood supply early on, and no cases of HIV have been detected recently through this mode of transmission. CENSIDA has been active since 1988 and collaborates with other government entities as well as with NGOs, including organizations of persons living with HIV/AIDS. This collaboration is a significant asset in the national response to HIV/AIDS, because a coordinated response between government and civil society has proven to be more effective than government entities acting alone.\\"Health Profile: Mexico\\" . United States Agency for International Development (June 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. Mexico established a national network of HIV/AIDS ambulatory health care facilities known as Centros Ambulatorios Para la Prevencion y Atencion en SIDA e ITS (CAPASITS). The CAPASITS are the result of collaboration among local governments, the national government, and NGOs and provide comprehensive community-based attention and treatment free of charge to people with HIV. In a landmark decision in February 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the military to discharge 11 HIV-positive soldiers and deny them access to military health services. The court ruled that being HIV- positive does not in itself imply an inability to serve in the armed forces and that the military must decide on a case-by-case basis whether or not a soldier can remain in active service. The ruling establishes a precedent allowing dismissed soldiers to seek redress in federal appeals court.

It is situated amongst water-meadows north-west of Dorchester not far from the confluence of the rivers Frome and Cerne. It is near to the village of Charminster. History The compact original courtyard section of the current building dates back to about 1480. Possibly dating back to Roman times, the house has been the country seat of several families, including the Mohuns and Trenchards. The current building is a relic built by the Trenchard family, once being one of the most prominent families in Dorset during the 16th century. Building Parts of Wolfeton House date back to the south side of an early quadrangular courtyard house, dating from the 16th century. The house has a three floored tower on the south side, with the topmost stage build in approximately 1862. West of the tower the wall was built in 16th century and leads to the octagonal garderobe tower. Inside the house is oak panelled and includes an extensive collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean carvings, including those of Roman Soldiers and a figure of a Briton brandishing a club. The main staircase of stone is believed to be unique, built in 1580 with carved figures in the balustrade. The Great Chamber's floor is original and dates to the 16th century, whilst the fireplace is carved with figures including a Native American. Gatehouse The gatehouse at Wolfeton House includes an inscription panel stating it was finished in 1534. The gatehouse is 2 storeys high with an attic and was built approximately east of the main building. It has two round towers which are not identical in size, with an entrance archway between, but off-centre. Around the door is a label mould, with two stops, showing a satyr and a woodmouse each holding staves. Above the door is cartouche dating from the early 18th century. It is available for holidays through the Landmark Trust.

HIV was first detected in Nicaragua in 1987, after concentrated epidemics had been reported in other Central American nations. The onset of the epidemic was likely delayed by Nicaragua‚Äôs 10-year civil war and the U.S.-led economic blockade, both of which left the country isolated for several years. Relative control over commercial sex work, low infection rates among injecting drug users, and a ban on the commercial sale of blood also slowed HIV transmission. However, the country is at risk of a broader epidemic because of social conditions such as multiple sex partners, gender inequality, and widespread poverty. Many people are unaware of their HIV status and could unwittingly spread the disease. UNAIDS estimates Nicaragua has 7,300 HIV- positive people, nearly half of whom were identified over the past three years. Sexual activity is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Nicaragua. Unprotected heterosexual intercourse is reported to account for 72 percent of HIV infections, and unprotected sex between men is estimated to account for 26 percent, according to UNAIDS. However, it is likely that the former is over- reported and the latter under-reported because of stigma and discrimination (S&D;) against homosexuals. HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is significantly higher (7.6 percent) than among sex workers or the general population. A 2002 study reported by UNAIDS demonstrated that infection levels among MSM were 38 times higher than among the general population. The latest study on HIV among commercial sex workers reported by UNAIDS demonstrated a prevalence of only 0.2 percent in that group. As of September 2005, more than half of reported HIV cases occurred among 20- to 39-year-olds, according to Nicaragua‚Äôs 2006 United Nations General Assembly Special Session on HIV report. Factors that put Nicaraguans at risk include early sexual debut; social pressures for males to have multiple sexual partners and take sexual risks; widespread poverty; women‚Äôs and girls‚Äô inability to negotiate when and under what circumstances to have sex or use condoms; gender-based violence; and sexual abuse of women and girls. Compounding these factors, access to HIV/AIDS services and information is limited in much of the country due to budgetary priorities and limitations. Moreover, conservative religious and social values make it difficult to talk about sex and ways to protect oneself from disease or unwanted pregnancy. National response Traditionally, HIV/AIDS prevention has not been a national priority in Nicaragua because HIV prevalence is low. The National Program for the Prevention and Control of HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections was not established until 1998. Before that, the Government of Nicaragua enacted the Law for the Promotion, Protection and Defense of Human Rights of People Living With HIV/AIDS (Law 238) in 1996, but the law did not go into effect until 1999. Law 238 created the Nicaraguan AIDS Commission (CONISIDA) in 2000, which is charged with enforcing the law and guiding the national response to HIV/AIDS. However, CONISIDA lacks the organizational and technical capacity to effectively fulfill its role in supporting government and civil society efforts to assist people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and prevent the spread of HIV. Of particular concern is CONISIDA‚Äôs failure to adequately ensure the rights of PLWHA. The Country Coordinating Mechanism, formed in 2000, has a variety of prominent members, including representatives from government; multilateral, nongovernmental, and educational organizations; the private sector; religious groups; and representatives of PLWHA. It oversees the HIV/AIDS grant from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund grant is for more than $10.1 million from 2004 to 2009. The purpose of the grant is to build on the existing national strategic plan for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) by strengthening prevention, care, and support activities; by ensuring comprehensive care for PLWHA; and by documenting all AIDS cases within the national surveillance system. In 2006, the government approved a new national strategic plan for 2005 to 2009 and a new national AIDS policy. Current efforts focus on increasing the response capacity of the health sector and ensuring the sustainability of measures and actions taken. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has integrated its HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis programs and adopted protocols for treating co-infected patients; however, it has not been able to achieve efficient coordination of the two programs in practice. Nicaragua is also strengthening primary care and implementing awareness, prevention, and protection efforts. Nicaragua is a partner in the Brazil+7 initiative, a UNICEF-, UNAIDS-, and Brazilian-led effort dedicated to expanding HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care for pregnant women and young people; to offering universal access to antiretroviral medication for PLWHA; and to ensuring universal access to services for preventing mother-to-child transmission. The other partner countries are S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Bolivia, Paraguay, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and East Timor.

The coefficients do not need to match. Unlike terms are two or more terms that are not like terms, i.e. they do not have the same variables or powers. The order of the variables does not matter unless there is a power. For example, 8xyz2 and ‚àí5xyz2 are like terms because they have the same variables and power while 3abc and 3ghi are unlike terms because they have different variables. Since the coefficient doesn't affect likeness, all constant terms are like terms. Generalization In this discussion, a \\"term\\" will refer to a string of numbers being multiplied or divided (remember that division is simply multiplication by a reciprocal) together. Terms are within the same expression and are combined by either addition or subtraction. For example, take the expression: ax+bx There are two terms in this expression. Notice that the two terms have a common factor, that is, both terms have an x. This means that we can factor out that common factor variable, resulting in (a+b)x If the expression in parentheses may be calculated, that is, if the variables in the expression in the parentheses are known numbers, then it is simpler to write the calculation a+b. and juxtapose that new number with the remaining unknown number. Terms combined in an expression with a common, unknown factor (or multiple unknown factors) are called like terms. Examples Example To provide an example for above, let a and b have arbitrary values, so that their sum may be calculated. For ease of calculation, let a=5 and b=3. The original expression becomes 5x+3x which may be factored into (5+3)x or, equally, 8x. This demonstrates that 5x+3x=8x The known values assigned to the unlike part of two or more terms are called coefficients. As this example shows, when like terms exist in an expression, they may be combined by adding or subtracting (whatever the expression indicates) the coefficients, and maintaining the common factor of both terms. Such combination is called combining like terms, and it is an important tool used for solving equations. Simplifying an expression Take the expression, which is to be simplified: 3(4x^2y-6y)+7x^2y-3y^2+2(8y-4y^2-4x^2y) The first step to grouping like terms in this expression is to get rid of the parentheses. Do this by distributing (multiplying) each number in front of a set of parentheses to each term in that set of parentheses: 12x^2y-18y+7x^2y-3y^2+16y-8y^2-8x^2y The like terms in this expression are the terms that can be grouped together by having exactly the same set of unknown factors. Here, the sets of unknown factors are x^2y, y^2, and y.. By the rule in the first example, all terms with the same set of unknown factors, that is, all like terms, may be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients, while maintaining the unknown factors. Thus, the expression becomes 11x^2y-2y-11y^2 The expression is considered simplified when all like terms have been combined, and all terms present are unlike. In this case, all terms now have different unknown factors, and are thus unlike, and so the expression is completely simplified.

It is located in the village of Bremanger on the island of Bremangerlandet. It is the church for the Bremanger parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1914 by the architect Anders Karlsen from Eid. The church seats about 400 people. The church was originally called Bremangerpollen Chapel. The name was changed to Bremanger Church in 1952. The church is located at Hauge, in the innermost part of the Bremangerpollen bay. The church was consecrated on 4 September 1914 by the bishop Johan Willoch Erichsen. History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1330, but it was likely not new at that time. The stave church was located at Grotle, on the southwest shore of the island of Bremangerlandet, about west of the village of Bremanger. In 1652, the church was remodeled and expanded such that it then had a cruciform design. In 1695, the church was torn down and replaced by a new timber-framed building. This new church was built just west of the site of the old building. This building was in use until 1865, when the aging church at Grotle was torn down. It was decided to move the location of the Bremanger parish church from Grotle to the village of Kalv√•g to the south since it would be more centrally located within the parish. The new Bremanger Church was completed in 1865. The people living in the northern part of Bremangerlandet island were now without a nearby church of their own. The new Bremanger Church to the south, on the island of Fr√∏ya was nearly to the south. The people who lived further north on the island complained that the journey to that church had become too long and strenuous. Going by boat from Bremangerlandet to Fr√∏ya was often a risky undertaking, which kept people from going to church. The people felt that if they got a church in their own village, many more people would get the opportunity to listen to the words of the Lord. These people, even the Vicar, had to eventually yield to such a strong argument, and so the work was started in the 1890s to erect a new annex chapel in the village of Hauge (now called Bremanger). A new chapel was built at Hauge in 1908 and on 1 July 1908 the parish was divided into two, with all of the farms between Vetvik (in the north) and N√∏tset (in the south) being transferred to the new Bremangerpollen parish. A few days after the establishment of the new parish, the new \\"bedehus\\" (chapel) was consecrated at Hauge for church functions. From the village of Vetvik the journey to church was still more than long enough, and for those who chose not to go by boat, the alternative was a three-hour hike across the mountain. The new chapel was very small and was not in use for very long. A new, larger chapel, known as Bremangerpollen Chapel was completed in 1914 to replace the little chapel that was originally used from 1908 until 1914. The stones for the foundation wall were taken from the mountain straight up from the church site. This work was carried out on a voluntary basis by the villagers themselves, in addition to the transportation of the wooden building material. In 1952, the chapel was renamed as Bremanger Church.

Thorne won the by-election by a majority of just eight votes from the Unionist candidate Leo Amery.

It is located in the village of Rugsund, on the southern coast of the Nordfjorden. It is the church for the Rugsund parish which is part of the Nordfjord prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1838 using plans by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 400 people. Rugsund Church is located on the Hessev√•gen farm on the mainland side of the village of Rugsund. The church has a seating capacity of 400, and was consecrated on 2 September 1838. The church is a wooden \\"long church\\". It was built using plans by the architect Hans Linstow. The church building was remodeled in 1912. History View of the church The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1330, but the church was likely built in the 12th century. The church was originally located on the island of Rugsund√∏ya. The first church was a stave church that was in use until 1650 when it was torn down and replaced. The new church was a small, timber-framed long church. This church burned down in 1834. After the fire, the parish debated where to built the replacement church since for a long time been at the old church site, there was such a shallow layer of soil that it was difficult to maintain the church cemetery on Rugsund√∏ya. The soil conditions were actually so bad that funeral parties transported masses of soil by boat to the graveyard. Because of this, it was decided to built a new graveyard and church across the small strait on the mainland in the village of Rugsund. The present church building was constructed in 1838 to replace the previous building on Rugsund√∏ya that burned down. The beautiful location of the previous church on the point above the harbour was a navigational landmark for ships. When the present church was to be built, people demanded a similarly beautiful location. At Rugsund, the church was centrally located with the main entrance facing the sea, and with an excellent view from the church steps across the sound to the island. The churchyard encircles the church, and furthest down to the sea, there is a stately gate that the seafarers in earlier times walked through on their way to church. This was also the place where the vicar went ashore when he came by boat from Davik.

Built at Whitestone, New York The fourth ship to be so named by the Navy, Beaufort (PCS-1387) was laid down on 22 May 1943, at Whitestone, New York; launched on 10 October 1944, as simply PCS-1387; sponsored by Miss Barbara C. Dietz; and commissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 27 November 1944, Lt. (jg.) Anthony C. Kupris, USNR, in command. World War II service After fitting out, the subchaser embarked upon her shakedown cruise on 15 December. She conducted that training out of Key West, Florida, between 22 December 1944 and 2 January 1945. On the latter day, PCS-1387 began duty with the Fleet Sonar School, Key West, Florida, as a training platform for new sonarmen. She also doubled as harbor guard ship at Key West. Such training duties continued past the end of the war, through the late 1940s, and into the 1950s. The 1950s, however, brought an increase in the extent of her zone of operations for, after that time, she ranged the Atlantic Ocean coast as far north as Narragansett Bay and south into the Caribbean. On 15 February 1956, she was named Beaufort. Just over a month later on 26 March, Beaufort was decommissioned at St. Petersburg, Florida.

She was retained in service for another 11 years under the Commandant, 6th Naval District, as a training ship for naval reservists.

Castelli was instrumental in helping the show reach Broadway and would later lead the effort to introduce Hair to a worldwide theatre audience. Beginning as an innovative lighting designer for ballet and opera, Castelli tried screenwriting, playwriting, choreographing and directing before becoming a producer of Hair in New York and then masterminding its many international productions. In later years, he became the artist in residence of a Mexican resort Belmond Maroma, where he created paintings for every room in the resort. Biography Castelli was born in Salon-de-Provence, Bouches-du- Rh√¥ne, France, of Corsican heritage. During World War II, he got a job operating the projector at a cinema. Castelli and his friends began to paint and to write and perform plays, operas and ballets to cast aside the gloom of Nazi-occupied Paris. At the age of 17, after the war, he toured Germany operating the lights for a small circus, learning theatre arts and developing innovative lighting techniques.\\"Bertrand Castelli's Legacy at Maroma\\", (2008)\\"Bertrand Castelli, producer of Broadway hit ‚ÄòHair,‚Äô dies by boat\\", The China Post, August 20, 2008 Early career Castelli began his professional artistic career in France working for ballet and opera companies in Paris, starting with lighting design. To finance his ambitions to create a serious ballet, at the age of 21 he first created a short ballet called 'Le colleur d'affiches' in which he costumed dancers as large advertising posters, which came to life advertising each product through a three-minute solo. He boldly pitched the unique concept to large companies such as Perrier, Cartier, Christian Dior and Cointreau. The companies were intrigued and provided financing. He then was able to stage a first-class production of his ballet Les Algues, composed by Guy Bernard, and hired the ballerina Janine Charrat to choreograph and dance the lead role. The ballet earned him considerable success and gave him an \\"entr√©e to the society of artists\\" that, at the time, included Louis-Ferdinand C√©line and Jean-Paul Sartre.Weber, Bruce. \\"Bertrand Castelli, Bon Vivant and an Early Producer of ‚ÄòHair,‚Äô Dies at 78\\", The New York Times, August 12, 2008, accessed September 9, 2008 He traveled in Paris art circles and rubbed elbows with Pablo Picasso, Marcel Marceau and Jean Cocteau.Horn p. 37 According to his daughter, he once worked as Picasso's assistant, and he was an occasional lover of Fran√ßoise Gilot, the mother of two of Picasso's children. For the next few years, he created, produced and directed works for Les Ballets Africaines, Champs Elysees Theatre and the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet Company. Other ballets that he worked on were Face To Face and Green Light, Red Light.The Times, August 29, 2008, p. 54 At the age of 24, he moved to New York and then on to Hollywood, where MGM offered him a contract. He wrote numerous plays, including The Umbrella which was produced both on Broadway and in London, The Men's Room and A Frenchman in New York, the last of which was turned into a film. He also wrote screenplays, episodes of television shows including The Millionaire, and a musical comedy together with Ogden Nash and Vernon Duke. He also choreographed striptease vignettes for The Body Shop, the famous club on Sunset Boulevard. In Hollywood, he befriended people like Gene Kelly, Igor Stravinsky, Aldous Huxley, Dorothy Parker and Ray Bradbury. Among other things, he had a role in the 1959 film Thunder in the Sun, a western starring Susan Hayward. Mr. Castelli‚Äôs marriage to Lorees Yerby,http://astro.temple.edu/~ruby/coffeehouse1/ who was a co- director of ‚ÄúRichard,‚Äù ended in divorce. In addition to Pandora, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived by another daughter, Josephine, also of Manhattan; a granddaughter; and two stepsons, Michael and Winston Dutton. Hair and later career At the time Hair opened off-Broadway in 1967, Castelli was the director of the Harkness Ballet Company, where he incorporated experimental ideas from Andy Warhol and eventual Hair director Tom O'Horgan. When the Hair team was unable to find a Broadway theater owner that would accept the controversial show, Castelli met with Michael Butler's father Paul and convinced him to use his considerable political clout to make the Biltmore Theater available.Horn p. 42 Shortly after Hair opened on Broadway in 1968, Butler gave Castelli the job of leading the many foreign language productions of the show.Horn, pp. 103‚Äì10 Castelli made the decision to translate Hair into the local language of each country at a time when Broadway shows were always done in English. He produced and sometimes directed companies in France, Germany, Mexico and several other countries, unearthing local and international talent such as Donna Summer and the French singer Julien Clerc. After Hair, Castelli returned to producing ballet, opera and musical comedy for a decade. In 1972, he wrote and produced Richard, a pre-Watergate lampoon of President Richard M. Nixon, starring John Carradine, Vivian Blaine and Mickey Rooney. He also invented a game similar to table-tennis called Plaff, for which he invented a paddle with two parallel surfaces connected by a hand grip. He married and later divorced Lorees Yerby, who was a co-director of Richard. They had two daughters, Pandora and Josephine.Weber, Bruce. \\"Bertrand Castelli, 78, Artist And a Producer of 'Hair'\\", The New York Times, August 13, 2008 During the last 15 years of his life, Castelli lived mostly in the Yucat√°n, Mexico, where he was artist in residence at the Maroma Resort and Spa in Riviera Maya, not far from Canc√∫n. He spent his retirement writing and painting abstract, Spanish-influenced, colorful artworks whose subject was often dancers and human movement, surrounded in retirement by his artistic young friends. He created a painting for every room in the resort. The New York Times described him as \\"a friend of the famous and not-so-famous, a cultivator of people, an avid pot smoker and devoted sensualist\\". His friend Michael Butler described him as a \\"crazy showman... the guy with the business suit and beads\\". Castelli died at the age of 78 in a hospital near the resort after being hit by a speedboat during his daily swim. Notes References *Horn, Barbara Lee.

He was mobilized in 1938. After the armistice, he failed in his attempt to join Free France in London. At Saint-√âtienne, he connected with the L'Espoir network affiliated to Franc-Tireur.

In 1942 Romans-Petit organised the maquis de l'Ain et du Haut-Jura, and on 11 November 1943 he marched in the town of Oyonnax at the head of his maquisards. This fact was said to have decided the English and French forces in London to send arms drops to the French maquisards who were in desperate need of them. An agent of the United Kingdom's clandestine Special Operations Executive, Richard Heslop, arranged the air drops of arms and equipment. Romans-Petit was involved in starting maquis in Haute-Savoie, before he passed over his responsibilities to Tom Morel so that he could dedicate himself completely to the Maquis de L'Ain. Over the summer of 1944 Romans-Petit set up a full civil administration at Nantua, and brought La voix du maquis into being. On the liberation of France, he was imprisoned for several weeks at Fort Lamothe at Lyon by the new commissaire de la R√©publique, Yves Farge.

Parts of the byway enter Black Hills National Forest, Custer State Park, and the Mt. Rushmore National Memorial; the byway also travels within of the Crazy Horse Memorial. The byway is named after Peter Norbeck, who served as governor of and senator for South Dakota. Route description The Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway consists of a loop made up of four numbered highways. The byway is part of US 16A, the Iron Mountain Road, south of Keystone. This portion of the highway includes several tunnels and pigtail bridges. The byway enters Custer State Park along its eastern edge and turns west at its intersection with SD 36. In the western part of the state park, the byway splits into two highways, one which follows US 16A westward and one which follows SD 87 northward. The US 16A portion of the byway runs into Custer, where the byway becomes part of SD 89 and heads north. This portion of the byway meets the SD 87 portion in the northwest corner of Custer State Park. The byway then follows SD 87 to its intersection with US 16 and US 385, where it becomes part of the nearby SD 244. The byway follows SD 244 eastward into the Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where it meets up with US 16A. History Most of the roads which make up the Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway were proposed by Peter Norbeck when he was a U.S. Senator. Norbeck's first major proposal was the Needles Highway, which comprises the SD 87 portion of the byway and cuts through the Needles. Though engineers of the time said a highway could not be built in the Needles,Peter Norbeck vs. the Diploma Boys: Building the Impossible Road the highway still came into existence. Norbeck also proposed the Iron Mountain Road, the US 16A section of the byway. The byway was established on September 23, 1996, and named in honor of Norbeck.

Scott Bundgaard has a long history of civil litigation. In 1986, he was convicted of one count of third degree burglary. After two years, his class four felony conviction was \\"expunged.\\" In 2003, the brokerage company he worked for was sued by a client for a loss of funds. The client was upset that he lost money that he had placed into a technology mutual fund. A settlement agreement was reached. Bundgaard sold his book of business several years later and voluntarily left the securities industry. In 2006, he was married in a covenant marriage but his wife had to call the police during the honeymoon, because she wanted to return home to her parents. In December 2012 Bundgaard filed a $10,000,000 lawsuit against the City of Phoenix alleging that three police officers, the mayor of Phoenix, the chief of police, five civilian witnesses and the victim of his domestic violence attack conspired to defame his character. The case was transferred to federal district court. In March 2014, Bundgaard requested the lawsuit be dismissed without a judgement, and ultimately received nothing from the City of Phoenix.

Early life Born about 1230, he was the third son of Herbert Weyland and his wife Beatrice, one of six daughters of Stephen Witnesham, a minor landowner from the village of that name. His three brothers, John, Richard and William, also pursued administrative and judicial careers.Oxford DNB:Weyland, Sir Thomas He first appears in official records in 1251 as an attorney for his brother John for the making of a final concord. In 1258 he paid 100 marks for the manor of Chillesford and purchased a second manor in 1258 at Blaxhall for 300 marks. It is not certain how he obtained such money, but it was probably from legal work in which he acquired the knowledge needed for his later progress. Although he had become a subdeacon to allow a career in the church, he reverted to lay status and was knighted in 1270. Judicial career In 1274 he was made a justice of the Common Bench after the death of his older brother William, who had previously held such a position. He served as a junior justice for four years, and was appointed Chief Justice in 1278 after the retirement of Roger Seaton, holding office for 11 years until his removal in 1289. This period is the first for which substantial law reports survive, presenting a mixed view. While they show he had a clear and sharp legal mind, often deciding litigation cases on his own or with one colleague, he was also involved in several instances of corruption and misconduct, including editing his plea roll in a land case involving one of his relatives, for which he was rewarded with an interest in the property in question. Many of these suspect cases were only turned up after his removal from office and, although some allegations were shown to be false, many were not. During this time he made large acquisitions of property, including seven manors in Suffolk, three in Essex and several others elsewhere. He spent an average of ¬£150 a year on property while in office, and though much of the money may have come from the profits of his and his wife's landholdings or from private legal work, his relative lack of scruples makes it possible some came from corruption. Downfall and exile His removal from office in 1289 was not, however, as a result of judicial misconduct. On 20 July 1289 two of his servants committed a murder at a village fair, killing William Carwel, an Irish servant of the Earl of Norfolk. The killing may have been as a result of a drunken brawl, but it is probable it was part of bitter factional fighting between followers of the earl, of whom Weyland was one of the leading councillors. After the servants returned to his house at Monewden he failed to have them arrested, despite knowing of the murder, thereby becoming an accessory. Due to the earl's desire to have the matter dealt with, a warrant was issued for a court of enquiry on 4 September and the two men were executed on 14 September. The jurors in the matter also indicted the Chief Justice for harbouring the killers, and orders were given for his arrest. A clerk of the sheriff of Suffolk was sent to capture him, but soon after his arrest he escaped under cover of darkness. He made his way to the Greyfriars house at Babwell on the outskirts of Bury St Edmunds, where he took the habit of the Franciscan order and received sanctuary. After his location became known, King Edward sent orders to his fellow justice Robert Malet to starve him out. Thomas surrendered early in 1290, most likely in return for safe travel to the Tower of London, where he was offered a choice between standing trial, perpetual imprisonment, and exile, of which he chose exile. On 20 February he took an oath not to return to any English territory, including Ireland, and was given nine days to reach Dover, his port of departure. By 1292 he had settled in Paris, but was pardoned by the king in 1297 and allowed to return home, where he died in 1298. Family In about 1266 he married Anna, daughter of Richard Colville, and they had a son John. Inheriting his father's lands, he too was knighted and married Mary, daughter of a major Suffolk landowner, Sir Richard Braose.

Life and career She was born in Denton, Texas. She graduated from University of North Texas College of Music (1930) and then continued with graduate studies in piano and composition at the Juilliard School with Reuben Goldmark and Frederick Jacobi from 1932 to 1939, earning a diploma. She simultaneously studied at New York University earning a master's degree in 1933 and a PhD in 1952. From 1932 to 1939, she served as pianist for the Orchestrette Classique of New York, a women‚Äôs orchestra. During this time, she also gave concerts of mostly American music in Latin America, Europe, and throughout the United States. As a performer, she became particularly associated with the works of Aaron Copland. From 1941 to 1946, she taught at the Hartt School, where she founded the department of music education. She joined ASCAP in 1945. As a composer, Smith is best known for her operas and orchestral works, which have all been performed. Her music incorporates elements of jazz, folk music and 20th-century French harmony. Her compositional style has an appealing directness and although tonal, makes interesting use of dissonance. Among her works are The String Quartet, which uses irregular metres and driving rhythms, and the operas Cynthia Parker and Cockcrow, which employ folk music within a generally conservative tonal idiom. Cynthia Parker was Smith's first opera. She had long been determined to write an opera on a Texas story, and that of Cynthia Parker was a gripping one. Kidnapped by Native Americans, Parker was raised by Comanche, eventually marrying a chief and raising three children of her own. She was found by Texas Rangers and returned to white society, but was unhappy there and eventually committed suicide. Smith plays up the differences between Native and settler cultures by using stereotypical \\"Indian\\" tropes for the Comanche and familiar and popular folk music for the white colonists of the American West. Smith was the recipient of several commissions and awards and was active in several music organizations, especially the National Federation of Music Clubs, for which she chaired the Decade of Women Committee (1970‚Äì79). As a writer her publications include Aaron Copland: his Work and Contribution to American Music (New York, 1955) and a Directory of American Women Composers (Chicago, 1970), of which she was the editor. She died in New York City. Many of her manuscripts, including those of her operas, are held by the Music Library at the University of North Texas in Denton.

Life He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1963 with a degree in English, having studied under poets Allen Tate and James Wright. In 1970, he received a Ph.D. from the University of California and began a career at Loyola University New Orleans, where he chaired the English Department and was editor of the New Orleans Review from 1980 - 1986. While at Loyola, he received an NEH summer fellowship to Princeton University and was a participant in the Institute of Medieval and Renaissance Studies at Duke University and in The School of Criticism and Theory at Northwestern University. As one of three editors of New Orleans Review (including poet John Biguenet and fellow English professor John Mosier), Henricksen helped turn the regional magazine into a major organ of critical discussion, bringing such theorists as Frederic Jameson, Jean-Francois Lyotard and others to the pages of the journal. His academic books include Murray Krieger and Contemporary Critical Theory, Reorientations: Critical Theories and Pedagogies, with Thais Morgan, and a widely referenced study of novelist Joseph Conrad entitled Nomadic Voices: Conrad and the Subject of Narrative. After surgery for throat cancer in 1996, Henricksen returned to Minnesota to live with his new wife, Victoria. There, what had previously been a secondary endeavor, writing fiction, became the primary one. His short stories appeared in numerous magazines, and in 2005 his story collection, Ticket to a Lonely Town, was the only named finalist in the national competition for the Grace Paley Prize. It was published the following year by Atomic Quill Press. Stories in this book are connected by recurrent characters and places, as the collection dramatizes various causes and forms of loneliness. In 2008 his novel, After the Floods (Lost Hills Books) appeared. Praised by the New Orleans Times-Picayune as a \\"thoroughly enjoyable flight of fancy\\" and \\"a spiritual comedy,\\" the novel, set partially in post- Katrina New Orleans, combines magical realism and deconstruction in a manner at once imaginative and accessible. Also in 2008, Henricksen co-edited a volume in honor of a former mentor, From the Other World: Poems in Memory of James Wright (Lost Hills Books), to which many of our best-known poets contributed. He founded Lost Hills Books, a small, literary publishing house, in 2007. As of 2008, Bruce Henricksen lives in Duluth Minnesota. During that year, he spoke on James Wright in libraries in the Twin Cities and throughout Minnesota. He and a few contributors to From the Other World also participated in a memorial event for James Wright at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, where he and Wright first met.

The operation fulfilled an American obligation under the Paris Peace Accord of January 1973, which ended direct American participation in the Vietnam War. It also was the first operational deployment of a U.S. Navy air mine countermeasures capability.Melia, pp. 99‚Äì101. Background The United States had largely disengaged from the Vietnam War when North Vietnam launched its Easter Offensive into South Vietnam in March 1972. In response, the United States Air Force and U.S. Navy launched Operation Linebacker, a major bombing offensive against North Vietnam. In addition, President of the United States Richard Nixon ordered the Commander-in-Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, Admiral Bernard A. Clarey, and the Commander-in-Chief, United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral James L. Holloway, to begin the Operation Pocket Money mining campaign against Haiphong and other North Vietnamese ports. The mining campaign, by U.S. Navy and United States Marine Corps attack aircraft from American aircraft carriers, began on 8 May 1972, and over the next several months laid thousands of mines in North Vietnamese waters.Melia, p. 101.\\"U.S. Mining and Mine Clearance in North Vietnam\\" by Edward J. Marolda, Naval History and Heritage Command, United States Department of the NavyOPERATION END SWEEP 6 February 1973 ‚Äì 27 July 1973 The removal of mines from North Vietnams coastal and inland waters Eventually, North Vietnam and the United States negotiated an end to the war and signed the Paris Peace Accords on 27 January 1973. A protocol to the agreement called for the United States to neutralize American mines in North Vietnams coastal and inland waterways.Melia, p. 109. Preparations Under the Hague Convention of 1907, the United States was required to eliminate the mine threat it had created after the end of hostilities. Accordingly, the U.S. Navys Mine Warfare Force (MINEWARFOR) began planning for removal of the mines as soon as Nixon ordered the mining campaign to begin. In order to ease post-war minesweeping, only mines that could be cleared by magnetic sweeps were used, and the vast majority of mines laid were programmed either to self-destruct or render themselves inert after a specified period of time. Of course, the U.S. Navy also knew generally where the mines had been laid, although the inherent inaccuracy of aerial minelaying meant that the precise location of each mine was not known. Rear Admiral Brian McCauley became Commander, Mine Warfare Force, and Commander, Task Force 78, in September 1972. Task Force 78 was designated as Mine Countermeasures Force, U.S. Seventh Fleet, and was created for the upcoming minesweeping operation that would become known as End Sweep. Minesweeping equipment and U.S. Navy personnel trained in minesweeping both were in short supply, so, in order to minimize the danger of mine explosions to American personnel and equipment, Task Force 78 planners devised an operational scheme in which minesweeping was limited to areas in which the mines already had rendered themselves inert. If all mines known to be in an area also were known to have passed their self-sterilization dates, Task Force 78 planned to conduct a check sweep of a few passes; if it was not clear that all mines in a given area had become inert, a more thorough clearance sweep was to be used.Melia, pp. 104‚Äì105. In the United States, the Chief of Naval Materiel, Admiral Isaac C. Kidd, Jr., organized a Mine Warfare Program Office charged with controlling scientific and technical support to End Sweep. The program office ensured that resources were allocated to the operation that allowed the rapid development of shallow-water minesweeper gear and precision navigation and locating systems, the latter providing minesweeping forces with an improved capability to determine the configuration of a minefield and to adjust their daily operations accordingly.Melia, p. 105. A Task Force 78 CH-53D Sea Stallion from the amphibious assault ship lifts a Magnetic Orange Pipe (MOP) mine countermeasure device during training at Subic Bay in the Philippines.Ten ocean minesweepers (MSOs) were assigned to Task Force 78 to sweep deep-water approaches to North Vietnamese ports and inland waterways and to serve as helicopter control vessels. In addition, the tank landing ship was modified in Japan between November 1972 and February 1973 to serve in End Sweep as a \\"special device minesweeper,\\" redesignated MSS-2. As such, she was intended to be used for check sweeps through waters which presumably were clear of active mines to ensure that passage indeed was safe. She was pumped full of polyurethane foam so that she would not sink if she struck a mine, was equipped with padding to protect her all-volunteer skeleton crew, and was modified so that her entire crew of six could remain topside during her minesweeping runs, ensuring that they would be blown overboard if she struck a mine rather than injured or killed by slamming into the overhead anywhere below decks.Melia, pp. 105, 109.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: Washtenaw County The Navy's newly created air mine countermeasures capability resided entirely in the CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters of Helicopter Mine Countermeasures Squadron 12 (HM-12), all of which were assigned to the operation. In addition, one detachment each from the Marine Corpss Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 463 (HMH-463) and Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 164 (HMM-164) provided a total of 24 more CH-53s. The helicopters practiced for the operation off Charleston, South Carolina, where it was discovered that the Marine Corps pilots inexperience in towing the heavy Mark 105 hydrofoil minesweeping sleds posed a risk to the personnel and equipment involved, a particularly unacceptable risk because of the scarcity and expense of the sleds. As a result, a scientist devised a buoyant, magnetized pipe filled with styrofoam which any helicopter pilot could tow easily. Painted orange, the new device became known as the Magnetic Orange Pipe (MOP).Melia, p. 107. Operations Ships of Task Force 78 in the Gulf of Tonkin, heading for North Vietnam to conduct Operation End Sweep. Task Force 78 was activated as a unit of the Seventh Fleet on 24 November 1972, while peace talks still were underway in Paris, and the ships and helicopter units making it up secretly gathered in the Philippines. The talks broke down in December 1972, however, so the task force awaited further developments into January 1973 while its helicopter crews practiced towing their minesweeping equipment in Subic Bay.Melia, p. 108. On 28 January 1973 ‚Äì the day after the peace accords were signed ‚Äì Task Force 78 departed the Philippines for Haiphong. McCauley met in Haiphong with his North Vietnamese opposite, Colonel Hoang Huu Thai, on 5 February 1973 to coordinate North Vietnamese actions with those of Task Force 78.

The helicopters swept the main shipping channel to Haiphong the same day. The next day, however, President Nixon ordered a suspension of End Sweep in response to North Vietnamese delays in releasing prisoners-of-war. End Sweep resumed on 6 March 1973. On 9 March 1973, a mine exploded ‚Äì the only one to explode during End Sweep ‚Äì as a minesweeping helicopter passed it and the explosion was captured on film by the helicopters Swept Mine Locator. On 17 March 1973, Task Force 78 helicopters swept the ports of Hon Gai and Cam Pha. Elsewhere in North Vietnam, U.S. Navy technical personnel prepared 50 North Vietnamese sailors to conduct their own minesweeping operations and American C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and helicopters from HMM-165 delivered minesweeping gear to the North Vietnamese at Cat Bi Airfield outside Haiphong. junk under sail is at right. Washtenaw County arrived at Haiphong from the Philippines on 6 April 1973, and made her first six check runs there on 14 April 1973, the first American ship to enter Haiphong harbor in over a decade. She had made only two out of a planned six runs the following day when further runs were suspended because the United States believed that the North Vietnamese government was not fulfilling its obligations under the Paris Peace Accords. Washington ordered a suspension of all minesweeping operations and, on 17 April 1973, Task Force 78 returned to Subic Bay for upkeep. On 13 June 1973, the United States and North Vietnam signed a joint communiqu√© in Paris which, among other things, required that the United States resume minesweeping no later than 20 June and complete all minesweeping no later than 13 July. With all mines by now past their latest possible sterilization date, End Sweep resumed on 18 June 1973. On 20 June, Task Force 78 completed its check sweeps of Haiphong, and soon had also cleared Hon Gai and Cam Pha. Next, the task force concentrated on the coastal areas off Vinh. The final minesweeping operations took place on 5 July 1973 and the next day, Rear Admiral McCauley informed the North Vietnamese that the United States had concluded its mine countermeasures operations in North Vietnamese waters. Operation End Sweep ended officially on 27 July 1973, and Task Force 78 withdrew from North Vietnamese waters the following day.

Nine amphibious warfare ships, six fleet tugs, three salvage ships, and 19 destroyer-type ships also operated in Task Force 78 during at least a portion of the six months of End Sweep. Two helicopters were lost, and Enhance suffered fire damage during the operation. The overall cost of the operation, including repairs to Enhance, was $20,394,000 more than the cost expected for normal operations of the units involved. The six ocean minesweepers that had conducted actual minesweeping operations spent 439 hours involved in them. Assessment Although End Sweep was a great success in the eyes of the American leadership and general public, U.S. Navy mine warfare analysts were less sanguine about what the operation had demonstrated. It was unusual in the U.S. Navy for a minesweeping operation to enjoy the political visibility and priority that End Sweep did, allowing the operation to make use of an amount and quality of U.S. Navy and Marine Corps staff, operational, and scientific resources not generally available to minesweeping, and analysts cautioned that such circumstances could not be counted on in future mine clearance campaigns. Moreover, the operation had been made relatively easy by the U.S. Navys knowledge of the types and locations of the mines that had been laid, the selection of only magnetic mines during the minelaying campaign, and the planned self-sterilization of so many mines before sweeping began.Melia, p. 110. The American public and many U.S. Navy personnel came away from End Sweep with the impression that helicopters had replaced surface ships in the minesweeping role due to their effectiveness and far greater mobility. Here, too, Navy mine warfare analysts differed with the popular impression. While helicopters swept three to six times faster than surface minesweepers, they also proved to be very demanding in terms of logistical support and manpower, and often were down for repair due to the high stress of minesweeping on the helicopters. Navy mine warfare analysts concluded that a balanced force of surface minesweepers and helicopters supported by a significant number of support ships would be required in future mine clearance operations.Melia, pp. 109‚Äì110.

Biography  Farge was a journalist for the Progr√®s de Lyon. His colleague, Georges Altman, put him in contact with the French Resistance movement Franc-tireur. In 1942, Farge met Jean Moulin. Farge was put in charge of the military organization of the massif du Vercors. He was also a member of the l‚Äô√©tat-major directed by General Delestraint. After the arrest of those two prominent resistance figures, Farge was sought by the Gestapo and went to Paris, where he presided over the Comit√© d‚Äôaction contre la d√©portation. General Charles de Gaulle named Farge commissaire de la R√©publique for the departements of la r√©gion rhodanienne. Farge saved 800 hostages who were at risk of being shot at Montluc Prison in Lyon. Farge was politically left-wing without having any specific affiliation. He served as minister of ravitaillement, a very difficult position, in the provisional government of Georges Bidault, from 8 January to 16 December 1946. He spoke out against wine smuggling and struggled hard against the black market. Farge was a progressive, and close to the communists. He participated in the founding of the Mouvement de la Paix in 1947, of which he became the president until his death in 1953 in a car accident in Georgia. He was also a member of the World Peace Council. For his actions in support of peace, he was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize in 1953. Farge was a compagnon de la Lib√©ration.

He is best known for his celebrated painting depicting the Battle of the Nile. Biography 'L'Orient' at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798 by George Arnald, 1825-27\\\\. 1855 √ó 2690 mm George Arnald was born in 1763. One account places his birth in the village of Farndip (now Farndish) in Northamptonshire (now Bedfordshire), although others suggest he was born in Berkshire. There is little information about Arnald's early years, but it is believed that he began his working life as a domestic servant before turning to the study of art. He was a student of the landscape painter and engraver William Pether (c. 1738-1821). Arnald first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1788, and eventually had 176 works exhibited there. He also exhibited 63 works at the British Institution. He was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy on 5 November 1810, but was never admitted to full membership. Speaking to Sir George Beaumont, who was influential in the founding of the British Institution and the National Gallery, William Wordsworth lamented Arnald's lack of literary education, stating that he Probably his best-known and most acclaimed work was a departure from his usual subject-matter. The Destruction of L'Orient at the Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798 is Arnald's only known maritime work, and was one of four paintings commissioned for ¬£500 each as part of a British Institution competition for paintings to hang in the Painted Hall of Greenwich Hospital. It was exhibited at the British Institution in 1827 and is now displayed at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London. It features as a \\"picture within a picture\\" in a work by Thomas Davidson, hanging alongside the famous Lemuel Abbott portrait of Lord Nelson in the gallery at Greenwich Hospital. Arnald was a friend of fellow painter John Varley, and in 1798 and 1799 the two toured Wales together. His students included the portrait painter Henry William Pickersgill, who became a full Royal Academician and whose eminent sitters included William Wordsworth, the Duke of Wellington and Sir Robert Peel. In addition to providing illustrations for a number of books, Arnald published on his own an album of views on the River Meuse in 1828 [The river Meuse : being delineations of the picturesque scenery on the river and its banks, from the city of Li√©ge to that of Mezi√®res. The drawings were made ... in ... 1818 / and are etched by George Arnald, engraved in mezzotint by S. W. Reynolds, C. Turner, W. Ward ... , T. Lupton, H. Dawe, J. P.

Eve's footprint is the popular name for a set of fossilized footprints discovered on the shore of Langebaan Lagoon, South Africa in 1995. They are thought to be those of a female human and have been dated to approximately 117,000 years ago. This makes them the oldest known footprints of an anatomically-modern human. The estimated age of Eve's footprint means that the individual who left the tracks in the soil, thought to be female, would have lived within the current wide range of estimates for the date of Mitochondrial Eve. History The three footprints were found in 1995 by geologist David Roberts from the Council for Geoscience and announced at a press conference with paleoanthropologist Lee R. Berger of the University of the Witwatersrand at Johannesburg, South Africa, at the National Geographic Society in Washington, D.C.. The discovery was documented in the August, 1997, issue of the South African Journal of Science. Berger and Roberts say the prints were made on a steep sand dune during a turbulent rainstorm. The location where they were found is in southwest South Africa about 60 to 70 miles (about 100 kilometres) northwest of Cape Town in the West Coast National Park. They were found in a ledge of sandstone at the edge of Langebaan Lagoon near the Atlantic coast. The preserved prints were moved to the South African Museum in Cape Town for protection and a concrete replica was mounted on the shores of Langebaan. The maker of the footprints lived in the time of the emergence of modern Homo sapiens, or people anatomically similar to humans alive today. The footprints measure eight and a half inches (22‚Äì26 centimetres) in length and are about the size of a modern-day (U.S.) woman's size 7¬Ω shoe (British size 6, continental European size 39¬Ω\\"Clothing size equivalents\\", Filofax.). In one foot impression the big toe, ball, arch, and heel clearly are discernible. Roberts thinks that the prints belong to an ancient female about 1.5 meters (5'3\\" to 5'4\\") tall. He said that the woman who made these footprints would resemble a contemporary woman. Fewer than three dozen hominid fossils from the period 100,000 to 200,000 years ago have been found. Berger said, \\"These footprints are traces of the earliest modern people.\\" Roberts explained further that dry sand blew over the wet footprints and filled the prints. They eventually were buried to a depth of about . The sand and accompanying crushed seashells hardened like cement into sedimentary rock and protected the footprints. The team later found associated evidence of stone tool use (a core, scrapers, cutting blades, and a spear point) in the same area that is believed to date from the same period. There also was evidence of the use of ochre, leading to the intriguing possibility that the 'Eve' of 117,000 years ago may have been wearing the colorful powder.

The federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was the placing into conservatorship of the government- sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) by the U.S. Treasury in September 2008. It was one of the financial events among many in the subprime mortgage crisis. On September 6, 2008, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), James B. Lockhart III, announced his decision to place the two GSEs into a conservatorship run by the FHFA. At the same press conference, United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, stated that placing the two GSEs into conservatorship was a decision he fully supported, and that he advised \\"that conservatorship was the only form in which I would commit taxpayer money to the GSEs.\\" He further said that \\"I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure, and to the ongoing housing correction.\\" The same day, the Federal Reserve Bank chairman Ben Bernanke stated in support: \\"I strongly endorse both the decision by FHFA Director Lockhart to place Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship and the actions taken by Treasury Secretary Paulson to ensure the financial soundness of those two companies.\\" The following day, Herbert M. Allison was appointed chief executive of Fannie Mae. He came from TIAA-CREF. Background and financial market crisis The combined GSE losses of US$14.9 billion and market concerns about their ability to raise capital and debt threatened to disrupt the U.S. housing financial market. The Treasury committed to invest as much as US$200 billion in preferred stock and extend credit through 2009 to keep the GSEs solvent and operating. The two GSEs had outstanding more than US$5 trillion in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt; the debt portion alone was $1.6 trillion. The conservatorship action has been described as \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\\", and one that \\"could turn into the biggest and costliest government bailout ever of private companies\\". With a growing sense of crisis in U.S. financial markets, the conservatorship action and commitment by the U.S. government to backstop the two GSEs with up to US$200 billion in additional capital turned out to be the first significant event in a tumultuous month among U.S.-based investment banking, financial institutions and federal regulatory bodies. By September 15, 2008, the 158-year-old Lehman Brothers holding company filed for bankruptcy with intent to liquidate its assets, leaving its financially sound subsidiaries operational and outside of the bankruptcy filing. The collapse was the largest investment bank failure since Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1990.Lehman Brothers ‚Äì Who we are Retrieved September 15, 2008 The 94-year-old Merrill Lynch accepted a purchase offer by Bank of America for approximately US$50 billion, a big drop from a year- earlier market valuation of about US$100 billion. A credit rating downgrade of the large insurer American International Group (AIG) led to a September 16, 2008 rescue agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank for a US$85 billion secured loan facility, in exchange for warrants for 79.9% of the equity of AIG.United States Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Press release: Federal Reserve Board, met with full support of the Treasury Department, authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend up to US$85 billion to the American International Group (AIG), September 16, 2008 Previous attempts at GSE reform Fannie Mae's Reston, Virginia, facility The GSE business model has outperformed any other real estate business throughout its existence. According to the Annual Report to Congress, filed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, over a span of 37 years, from 1971 through 2007, Fannie Mae's average annual loss rate on its mortgage book was about four basis points. Losses were disproportionately worse during the crisis years, 2008 through 2011, when Fannie's average annual loss rate was 52 basis points. Freddie Mac's results are comparable. By way of contrast, during 1991‚Äì2007, commercial banks' average annual loss rate on single-family mortgages was about 15 basis points. During 2008‚Äì2011, annual losses were 184 basis points. The FHFA studyFHFA study compares, on an apples-to-apples basis, GSEs loan originations with those for private label securitizations. The study segments loans four ways, by adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)-versus-fixed-rate, as well as by vintage, by FICO score and by loan-to-value ratio. In almost every one of 1800 different comparisons covering years 2001 through 2008, GSE loan performance was exponentially better. On average, GSE fixed-rate loans performed four times better, and GSE ARMs performed five times better. However, other critics in D.C. claim that the GSE business model faces inherent conflicts due to its combination of government mission and private ownership. The GSEs were given monopoly privileges against which private enterprise could not compete. Both GSEs had a line of credit with the US Treasury Department, and both GSEs were exempt from state and local income tax on corporate earnings. The GSEs were the only two Fortune 500 companies exempt from regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because of implicit government backing, Fannie Mae discount notes became the second-largest short- term notes issued (second only to Treasury bills). The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank, argues that \\"the government mission required them to keep mortgage interest rates low and to increase their support for affordable housing. Their shareholder ownership, however, required them to fight increases in their capital requirements and regulation that would raise their costs and reduce their risk-taking and profitability. But there were two other parties‚ÄîCongress and the taxpayers‚Äîthat also had a stake in the choices that Fannie and Freddie made. Congress got some benefits in the form of political support from the GSEs' ability to hold down mortgage rates, but it garnered even more political benefits from GSE support for affordable housing.\\"AEI ‚Äì The Last Trillion Dollar Commitment However, such claims were at odds with the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC). In 2003, the Bush Administration sought to create a new agency, replacing the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In 1992 in the wake of the savings and loan crisis, and over concern similar lending problems would develop, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight was created as part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While Senate and House leaders voiced their intention to bring about the needed legislation, no reform bills materialized. A Senate reform bill introduced by Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) (S.1656S.1656) never made it out of the 21-member (10 D, 11 R) Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. At the time, some members of the 108th congress expressed faith in the solvency of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congressman Barney Frank (D-MA), for example, described them as \\"not facing any kind of financial crisis\\". In 2005, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act,Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act sponsored by Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE) and co-sponsored by Senators Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), John McCain (R-AZ) and John Sununu (R-NH), would have increased government oversight of loans given by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Like the 2003 bill, it also died in the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, this time in the 109th Congress. A full and accurate record of the congressional attempts to regulate the housing GSEs is given in the Congressional Record prepared in 2005.https://digital.library.unt.edu/govdocs/crs/permalink/meta- crs-7896:1  Federal Housing Finance Agency and Treasury authority  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008‚Äîpassed by the United States Congress on July 24, 2008 with bipartisan support and signed into law by President George W. Bush on July 30, 2008 ‚Äî enabled expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by the newly established FHFA, and gave the U.S. Treasury the authority to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac, limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The law raised the Treasury's debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to a total of US$10.7 trillion, in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Banks.

Executive office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Washington DC. Prior GSE support measures The September 7 conservatorship was termed by The Economist as the \\"second\\" bailout of the GSEs. Prior to the enactment of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, on July 13, 2008, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced an effort to backstop the GSEs based on prior statutory authority, in coordination with the Federal Reserve Bank. That announcement occurred after a week in which the market values of shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell almost by half (from a previously diminished value of approximately half of year-earlier market highs). That plan contained three measures: an increase in the line of credit available to the GSEs from the Treasury, to provide liquidity; the right for the Treasury to purchase equity in the GSEs, to provide capital; and a consultative role for the Federal Reserve in a reformed GSE regulatory system. On the same day, the Federal Reserve announced that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would have the right to lend to the GSEs as necessary. Capital infusion by the Treasury The agreement the Treasury made with both GSEs specifies that in exchange for future support and capital investments of up to US$100 billion in each GSE, at the inception of the conservatorship, each GSE shall issue to the Treasury US$1 billion of senior preferred stock, with a 10% coupon, without cost to the Treasury. Also, each GSE contracted to issue common stock warrants representing an ownership stake of 79.9%, at an exercise price of one- thousandth of a U.S. cent ($0.00001) per share, and with a warrant duration of twenty years. The conservator, FHFA signed the agreements on behalf of the GSEs.See the senior preferred stock and common stock warrant agreements disclosed by the Department of the Treasury on September 9, 2008: * Fannie Mae Senior Preferred Stock * Fannie Mae Certificate * Fannie Mae Warrant for Common Stock * Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock * Freddie Mac Certificate * Feddie Mac Warrant for Common Stock The 100 billion amount for each GSE was chosen to indicate the level of commitment that the U.S. Treasury is willing to make to keep the financial operations and financial conditions solvent and sustainable for both GSEs. The agreements were designed to protect the senior and subordinated debt and the mortgage backed securities of the GSEs. The GSEs' common stock and existing preferred shareholders will bear any losses ahead of the government. Among other conditions of the agreement, each GSE's retained mortgage and mortgage backed securities portfolio shall not exceed $850 billion as of December 31, 2009, and shall decline by 10% per year until it reaches $250 billion. FHFA initial actions as conservator In the September 6, 2008 conservatorship announcement, Lockhart indicated the following items in the plan of action for the Federal Housing Finance Agency conservatorship: # On September 8, 2008, the first business day of the conservatorship, business will be transacted normally, with stronger backing for the holders of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), senior debt and subordinated debt. # The Enterprises will be allowed to grow their guarantee MBS books without limits and continue to purchase replacement securities for their portfolios, about $20 billion per month, without capital constraints. # As the conservator, the FHFA will assume the power of the Board and management. # The present Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been dismissed but will stay on to help with the transition. # Appointed as CEOs are Herbert M. Allison for Fannie Mae and David M. Moffett for Freddie Mac. Allison is former Vice Chairman of Merrill Lynch and for the last eight years chairman of TIAA-CREF. Moffett is the former Vice Chairman and CFO of US Bancorp. Their compensation will be significantly lower than the outgoing CEOs. They will be joined by equally strong non-executive chairmen. # Other management action will be very limited. The new CEOs agreed it is important to work with the current management teams and employees to encourage them to stay and to continue to make important improvements to the Enterprises. # To conserve over $2 billion annually in capital, the common stock and preferred stock dividends will be eliminated, but the common and all preferred stocks will remain outstanding. Subordinated debt interest and principal payments will continue to be made. # All political activities, including all lobbying, will be halted immediately. Charitable activities will be reviewed. # There will be financing and investing relationship with the U.S. Treasury via three different financing facilities to provide critically needed support to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and also to the liquidity of the mortgage market. One of the three facilities is a secured liquidity facility, which will be not only for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but also for the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks that are regulated by FHFA. Government support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac In addition to the government conservatorship, which CBO estimates will increase the federal government's net liabilities by $238 billion, several government agencies have taken steps to increase liquidity within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Among these steps includes: # Federal Reserve purchases of $23 billion in GSE debt (out of a potential $100 billion) and $53 billion in GSE-held mortgage backed securities (out of a potential $500 billion). # Federal Reserve purchases of $24 billion in GSE debt. # Treasury Department purchases of $14 billion in GSE stock (out of a potential $200 billion). # Treasury Department purchases of $71 billion in mortgage backed securities # Federal Reserve extension of primary credit rate for loans to the GSEs  National debt accounting  The on- or off-balance sheet obligations of the two GSEs, which are \\"independent\\" corporations rather than federal agencies, are just over $5 trillion, a significant amount when compared to the $9.5 trillion of officially reported United States public debt at the time of the takeover. The September 6, 2008 conservatorship and the subsequent planned Treasury infusion of capital support the senior liabilities, subordinated indebtedness, and mortgage guarantees of the two firms. Some observers see this as an effective nationalization of the companies that ultimately places taxpayers at risk for all their liabilities. The federal government follows specialized accounting standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board. The net exposure to taxpayers is difficult to determine at the time of the takeover and depends on several factors, such as declines in housing prices and losses on mortgage assets in the future. The Congressional Budget Office director Peter R. Orszag announced on September 9, 2008 that the CBO intended to incorporate the assets and liabilities of the two companies into their federal budget planning, due to the degree of government control over the entities. The White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008 indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the GSE debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention. Bloomberg reported that according to CMA Datavision of London that \\"five-year credit-default swap contracts on U.S. government debt increased 3.5 basis points on September 9, 2008 to a record 18, up from 6 basis points in April,\\" in reaction to concerns about the potential rise in U.S. debt from bailouts. Related legislation On May 8, 2013, Representatives Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget. Market consequences Bank reserves Many commercial banks in the United States own Freddie and Fannie preferred shares. Those shares have had their dividends suspended, and are junior to the senior preferred stock issued to the Treasury in the restructuring of the two companies. The market value of the preferred shares plunged after the restructuring announcement and suspension of dividends. Banks were required to write down the value of Freddie and Fannie preferred stock held in their portfolios, compounding capitalization concerns for certain U.S. banks. Shen, Linda (September 8, 2008). Lenders With \`Outsized' GSE Stakes May Need Capital, Bloomberg, Accessed 8 September 2008 Gateway bank agreed to be bought out by Hampton Roads Bankshares Inc. to make up for a writedown of $40 million on its stock in Fannie and Freddie, which put it below regulatory requirements to be considered adequately capitalized. Credit default swaps In the credit default swap (CDS) market, the standard contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because of the change in management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company will default on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in credit default swaps is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$500 billion, and that the entire CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$62 trillion. Settlement on the contracts, will likely be the largest in the market's decade-long history. Credit-default swaps on Fannie and Freddie have been among the most actively traded the several months leading up to the conservatorship. \\"Thirteen 'major' dealers of credit-default swaps agreed 'unanimously' that the rescue constitutes a credit event triggering payment or delivery of the companies' bonds,\\" according to a memo circulated by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) after the conservatorship announcement. The day after the conservatorship announcement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which sets industry standardized contracts for financial derivatives and swaps, announced it was working on a protocol on how to evaluate and settle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac credit default swaps. Most of these swaps were settled on October 6, 2008. Paradoxically (in relation to typical experiences when a company issuing bonds has a \\"credit event\\"), the value of the two GSEs bonds rose to the vicinity of par value after the conservatorship. This means, that some owners of swaps that were hedging against the risk of a bond default, may be worse off, since the value of the bonds may be higher than when they purchased the swap. Cash auctions are reported to be scheduled for October 2008 to settle CDS contracts in relation to the GSEs. September 2008 reactions to the seizure The immediate reactions in the finance markets on Monday September 8, the day following the seizure, appeared to indicate satisfaction with at least the short-term implications of the Treasury's intervention. Governor of the Bank of Japan Masaaki Shirakawa stated \\"We expect the action would lead to stabilize the U.S. [mortgage-backed securities] market, financial market and the international financial market.\\" Governor of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, Zhou Xiaochuan stated \\"From my point of view this is positive\\". Effects on the subprime mortgage crisis The effects on the subprime mortgage crisis have led the government to support the soundness of the obligations and guarantees on securities issued by Fannie and Freddie to obtain funds. Those funds are in turn used to purchase mortgages from originating banks. The continuing soundness of GSE obligations enhances market liquidity (loanable funds) in the following ways:Cramer, Jim. \\"Fannie, Freddie Takeover Changes the Game\\". TheStreet.com. September 6, 2008. *Banks can be assured that Fannie and Freddie have funds to purchase conforming loans, so they can increase such lending. This improves liquidity in the mortgage market, lowering interest rates. *In 2006, Fannie and Freddie insured 70% of all subprime loans so they needed to keep these loans viable. *Lower borrowing costs for banks typically increase the \\"spread\\" between the rate at which they borrow and which they lend. This increases bank profitability, shoring up bank liquidity and balance sheets further. *Adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) rates are reduced, which lowers pressure on homeowners and reduces foreclosures. Lower rates also encourage new home purchases. *The government's role as the primary investor allows a systematic loan refinancing process to be implemented. This should enable rapid loan adjustments or workouts for homeowners, which have been facing bottlenecks due to the requirement to have various investors approve the adjustments.Schoen, John W. \\"Mortgage relief plan falling short\\". MSNBC. March 14, 2008. For example, the government could rapidly push-down 45-year mortgage terms and fixed, low interest rates, enabling many more homeowners to stay in their homes. This will reduce foreclosures significantly, helping to stabilize home prices. *The government can restructure mortgages so that the loan balance is reduced to the current market value, reducing the incentive for homeowners to \\"walk away\\" from the property. *With home prices more stabilized, the value of mortgage-backed securities receives some upward support. Financial condition of Fannie and Freddie prior to takeover Over 98% of Fannie's loans were paying timely during 2008.Ivry, Bob; Lynch, Sharon L. \\"Fannie Mae Unsold $5 Billion Homes Bring Peril to Shareholders\\". Bloomberg LP. July 23, 2008. Both Fannie and Freddie had positive net worth as of the date of the takeover, meaning the value of their assets exceeded their liabilities. However, Fannie's total assets to capital (leverage ratio) was about 20:1, while Freddie's was about 70:1.\\"Fannie Q2 10Q Report\\" (pdf). United States Securities and Exchange Commission. August 8, 2008.\\"Freddie Mac Consolidated Statements of Income (Unaudited)\\" . Freddie Mac. August 6, 2008. These numbers increase significantly if one includes all the mortgage-backed assets they guaranteed. These ratios are considerably higher than investment banks, which leverage around 30:1. However, there was concern that the GSEs' liquidity was insufficient to handle growing delinquency rates, such that although viable in September 2008, the scale of loss in the future would be sufficient that insolvency would occur and that knowledge of this future failure would induce immediate or near-immediate failure due to buyers refusing to buy debt. Both GSEs roll over large amounts of debt on a quarterly basis and failure to sell debt would lead to failure due to lack of liquidity. A slower form of failure would be the issuing of debt at high cost (to compensate buyers for risk), which would greatly diminish the earning power of both GSEs, rendering them unable to earn the money they would need to handle expected future losses. Both GSEs counted large amounts of deferred tax assets towards their regulatory capital, which were considered by some to be of \\"low quality\\" and not truly available capital. The deferred tax assets would only have value if the companies were profitable and could use the assets to offset future taxes. Both companies had experienced significant losses and were likely to face more over the next year or longer.Kopecki, Dawn. \\"Fannie Mae, Freddie 'House of Cards' Prompts Takeover\\". Bloomberg LP. September 6, 2008. Ongoing status of Fannie and Freddie conservatorship In testimony before a House Financial Services Committee subcommittee on June 3, 2009, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director James B. Lockhart III presented his report, \\"The Present Condition and Future Status of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\\". Highlights of the report include the Treasury Department's commitment to fund up to $200 billion in capital for each enterprise is expected be sufficient; the enterprises own or guarantee 56% of the single family mortgages in this country, or $5.4 trillion of the total $11.9 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt; their combined share of mortgages originated in the first quarter of 2009 was 73%; private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS) are a major driver of Enterprise losses; both Enterprises are heavily involved in planning and implementing the Making Home Affordable and the Home Affordable Refinance programs. The report notes: > As of March 31, 2009, seriously delinquent loans accounted for 2.3% of > single-family mortgages owned or guaranteed for Freddie Mac and 3.2% for > Fannie Mae. While those are historically high levels, they compare favorably > to industry averages of 4.7% for all prime loans, 7.2% for all single-family > mortgages, 24.9% for all subprime mortgages, and 36.5% for subprime > adjustable rate mortgages The report provides background on the origins of PLS and the risk they present. PLS loans represent 15% of mortgages but 50% of serious delinquencies. In contrast, at year-end 2008, the loans the enterprises held or guaranteed represented 56% of the U.S. single-family mortgages outstanding, but 20% of serious delinquencies. The credit quality of investments in PLS has proven to be much worse than the initial AAA credit ratings of those securities would have suggested. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the true economic value of PLS will continue to raise safety and soundness concerns. The report notes the for-profit structure of the GSEs worked counter to prudent risk management as competition reduced both market share and profits, thus eroding the GSEs credit requirements. To maintain profitability, each Enterprise increased purchases of PLS backed by alternative mortgages and of high-risk whole loans. And while many had criticized the OFHEO and sought to replace it: > Purchases of PLS ultimately proved disastrous for the Enterprises. Credit > and market-value losses would have been even larger had the Office of > Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), one of FHFA's predecessor > agencies, not increased the Enterprises' capital requirement by 30% and > capped their asset portfolios because of accounting and control problems. The George W. Bush administration was prevented from taking official action due to Senate Bill 190 of the 109 Congress never being allowed a full Senate vote, even though it was passed out of committee on a 13-9 vote along party lines (13 Republicans voted \\"Yes\\" and 9 Democrats voted \\"No\\"), doing so would have prevented Congress' home ownership goals being realized. On June 16, 2010, it was announced that the two GSEs would have their shares delisted from the NYSE. An article from August 2012 in Bloomberg noted that the companies \\"have drawn $190 billion in aid and paid $46 billion in dividends since being taken over by U.S. regulators in 2008\\". CBS News reported on August 6, 2015, that Fannie Mae alone has paid a total of $142.5 billion in dividends since receiving a bailout of $116 billion in 2008. On September 24, 2012, a judge dismissed a class-action lawsuit that contended that Freddie Mac made misleading statements about its exposure to risky loans in the run-up to the company's federal takeover. As of 2018, profits from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are still being sent to the Treasury Department.  Plans to rent houses  On August 10, 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency asked investors for ideas on renting homes owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration.

The first storm of the 1992 Pacific hurricane season, Ekeka developed on January 28 well to the south of Hawaii. It gradually intensified to reach major hurricane status on February 2, although it subsequently began to weaken due to unfavorable wind shear. It crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm, and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status. Ekeka continued westward, passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk State, before dissipating on February 9 about 310 miles (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths.  Meteorological history  During the El Ni√±o of 1991‚Äì92, as typical with other such events, the monsoon trough extended into the central north Pacific Ocean, which is the body of water between the International Date Line and 140¬∞W. At the same time, sea surface temperatures near the equator were anomalously warm, and wind shear values were low. At the end of January, a large area of convection persisted for several days near the north side of the equator. By January 23, several ships reported squalls and strong southwesterly winds in the region. The Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring the system on January 26, while it was located about 950 miles (1530 km) south of Ka Lae, the southernmost point in Hawaii. The disturbance organized further as it tracked westward, and on January 28 it developed into Tropical Depression One-C, located a short distance north of Kiritimati and east of Tabuaeran. With favorable conditions, the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm; upon doing so, it was named Ekeka by the CPHC, which is Hawaiian for Edgar. Ekeka continued gradually intensifying while moving slowly west- northwestward, and it attain hurricane status on January 30 about 100 miles (160 km) northwest of Palmyra Atoll. On February 2, the hurricane attained peak winds of 115 mph (185 km/h), making Ekeka a major hurricane, or Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. Subsequently, it began to weaken due to increased wind shear, and concurrently its forward motion increased as the subtropical ridge strengthened to the north of the hurricane. A large trough in the Westerlies increased the wind shear, which weakened Ekeka to a tropical storm early on February 3. Later that day, it crossed the International Date Line into the western Pacific Ocean; both of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) assessed the storm's winds at 50 mph (85 km/h). Shortly before that, the JMA assessed the pressure as 985 mbar, which is the lowest known minimum central pressure associated with the storm; the CPHC did not include pressure in their year-end report. Tropical Storm Ekeka continued weakening, degrading to tropical depression status by February 4. The depression moved quickly through the Marshall Islands, and on February 6 turned to the west-southwest. On February 8, the JMA declared Ekeka dissipated; however, the JTWC continued monitoring the system, with Ekeka passing over Chuuk as a weak depression. Early on February 9, the JTWC declared Ekeka dissipated about 800 miles (1300 km) east-southeast of Palau, or about 310 miles (500 km) off the north coast of Papua New Guinea.  Impact and records  No deaths were reported in association with Ekeka. The storm passed through the Marshall Islands without causing significant impact. When Ekeka hit the island of Chuuk, winds of 20 mph (32 km/h) were reported. While in the central Pacific Ocean, Ekeka became one of only three tropical cyclones on record to be located within the Palmyra Atoll Exclusive Economic Zone; Ekeka was the only hurricane within the area. Ekeka is most unusual for its formation in January. Tropical cyclones rarely form east of the International Date Line outside of the tropical cyclone season, which starts May 15 in the eastern Pacific and June 1 in the central Pacific, and ends on November 30 in both regions. In the official Pacific hurricane database, Ekeka was the second tropical cyclone on record to occur in January or February within the Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line, after Tropical Storm Winona of 1989. It is third earliest cyclone on record within the basin, behind Hurricane Pali of 2016, and the aforementioned Winona.

Armenians had traded with Ethiopia from the first century AD. Religion The Armenian presence in Ethiopia is historic. On a religious basis, the Ethiopian Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church are both members of the Oriental Orthodox communion of churches alongside Coptic Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Eritrean Orthodox and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church (India) churches. The Armenian inhabitants in Ethiopia are Armenian Apostolics (Orthodox Armenians) belonging to the Armenian Apostolic Church. The Armenian Apostolic (Orthodox) have their own church, Sourp Kevork (St. George) Armenian Apostolic Church in Addis Ababa. The first-ever pastor of the Armenian community was Rev. Hovhannes Guevherian. History Armenians had traded with Ethiopia from as early as the first century AD. Besides the obvious religious affiliation, there is also the story of the \\"Arba Lijoch\\" children coming to Ethiopia after the Armenian Genocide. Arba Lijoch were a group of 40 Armenian orphans who had escaped from the atrocities in Ottoman Empire, and were afterwards adopted by Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, then Crown Prince Ras Tafari. He had met them while visiting the Armenian monastery in Jerusalem. They impressed him so much that he obtained permission from the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem to adopt and bring them to Ethiopia, where he then arranged for them to receive musical instruction. The Arba Lijoch arrived in Addis Ababa in 1924, and along with their bandleader Kevork Nalbandian became the first official orchestra of the nation. Nalbandian also composed the music for Ethiopia Hoy (words by Yofteh√© Negus√©), which was the Imperial National Anthem from 1930 to 1974. Armenians have a much older presence in Ethiopia. Indeed, one of the first recorded diplomatic missions to Europe from Ethiopia was led by Matthew the Armenian who traveled to Portugal and Rome at the request of the Dowager Empress Eleni of Ethiopia to appeal for aid against Islamic incursions into Ethiopia in the 16th Century. The population peaked in shortly before the Italian invasion in 1935 at around 2,800. By the fall of the Ethiopian monarchy in 1974, it was around 2,000, after which the numbers fell precipitously.

Hamas had previously refused to accept the conditions set by Israel and the Quartet on the Middle East for continued aid to the PA under a Hamas government including recognition by Hamas of Israel, the disavowal of violent actions, and acceptance of previous agreements between Israel and the PA, including the Oslo Accords. After Hamas formed the PA government in March 2006, led by Ismail Haniya, Israel and the Quartet stopped having any dialogue with the PA and especially any member of the Hamas government, ceased providing aid to the PA and imposed sanctions against the PA. Following the Hamas takeover, Egypt and Israel largely closed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that Fatah had fled the Strip and was no longer able to provide security on the Palestinian side.Isabel Kershner.

Israel said that the blockade was necessary to protect Israeli citizens from \\"terrorism, rocket attacks and any other hostile activity\\" and to prevent dual use goods from entering Gaza. In doing so it violated or failed to fulfil specific obligations it had committed to under the terms of various ceasefire agreements on different occasions to alleviate or lift the blockade.: \\"After the last big Israeli effort to stop the rockets, in November 2012, it was agreed that, along with a ceasefire, the blockade of Gaza would gradually be lifted and the crossings into Egypt and Israel would be opened.

It said the restrictions had to be eased to allow construction materials \\"to enter in sufficient quantities\\" and to allow exports. \\"The economy cannot survive without being connected to the outside world\\", The World Bank said the tightened restrictions meant the construction sector's output was reduced by 83%.Gaza Strip Economy on ‚ÄòVerge of Collapse,‚Äô World Bank Says . New York Times, 22 May 2015 Background  Israel built the Israel and Egypt‚ÄìGaza Strip barrier between 1994 and 2005, as a security measure to stop the infiltration of terrorists, including suicide bombers, into Israel. The construction of a border fence was envisaged in the Oslo Accords, as was the control by Israel of all borders of the Palestinian territories. There are four border crossings through the barrier: the Kerem Shalom, Karni, Erez, and Sufa crossings. All goods bound for Gaza through Israel must pass through one of these crossings, and undergo security inspection before being permitted into Gaza. Additionally, the Egypt-Gaza barrier was built underground by Egypt starting in 2009. The stated aim was to block smuggling tunnels. The Egyptian Border Police maintain a presence along the Egypt-Gaza border. The Rafah Border Crossing is the only lawful crossing point between Egypt and Gaza, and was manned by Palestinian Authority security forces and the European Union Border Assistance Mission Rafah. All humanitarian supplies are transferred through Israel or Egypt via the land crossings after security inspection. One year after the 2005 disengagement from the Gaza Strip by Israel, Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006, winning control of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Israel and the Quartet on the Middle East had stated that their continued aid to the PA under a Hamas government was conditional on Hamas' recognition of Israel, the disavowal of violent actions, and acceptance of previous agreements between Israel and the PA, including the Oslo Accords. When Hamas formed a government in March 2006 led by Ismail Haniya, refusing to accept these conditions, Israel and the Quartet stopped having any dialogue with the Palestinian Authority and especially any member of the Hamas government, ceased providing aid to the PA and imposed sanctions against the PA. In March 2007, Hamas and Fatah formed a PA unity government, also headed by Haniya. Shortly after, in June, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip during the Battle of Gaza, seizing government institutions and replacing Fatah and other government officials with Hamas members. Following the takeover, besides other measures, Israel and Egypt closed the border crossings with Gaza, marking the start of the blockade of the Gaza Strip. At the same time, international relations and aid to the Fatah-led government in the West Bank resumed and the economic sanctions lifted. Restrictions on movement of people The Al-Aqsa Intifada broke out in September 2000 and Israel imposed trade restrictions on the Gaza Strip and closed the Gaza International Airport. The economic impact worsened after the creation of a 'buffer zone' in September 2001, that sealed the entry and exit points in the Palestinian territories. After 9 October 2001, the movement of people and goods across the ‚ÄòGreen Line‚Äô, the border between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and Israel, was halted, and a complete internal closure came into effect on 14 November 2001.'Palestinian goods were subsequently denied passage through the West Bank border crossings with Jordan. Gaza‚Äôs Rafah crossings with Egypt and Israeli transit facilities. Thousands of truck-loads of goods were impounded in Israeli ports. After 14 November, the Israeli army imposed an almost complete internal closure on the territories. The economic blockade deprived the PA of the taxes in goods and salaries of those Palestinians employed in Israel'. Lucy Dean (ed.)The Middle East and North Africa, 2004, Routledge, London 2003 p.924 The worsening economic and humanitarian situation raised great concern abroad. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in January 2003, the Israeli blockade and closures had drained as much as US$2.4 billion out of the economy of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.Lucy Dean (ed.),The Middle East and North Africa, 2004, Routledge 2003 p.925 Palestinian workers wait at the Erez Crossing to enter the Gaza Strip, July 2005. Israel forces left the Gaza Strip on 1 September 2005 as part of Israel's unilateral disengagement plan. An \\"Agreement on Movement and Access\\" (AMA) between Israel and the PA was concluded in November 2005 to improve the movement of people and economic activity in the Gaza Strip. Under its terms, the Rafah crossing with Egypt was to be reopened, with transits monitored by the PA and the European Union. Only people with Palestinian identity cards or foreign nationals, subject to Israeli oversight, were permitted to cross.Agreed documents by Israel and Palestinians on Movement and Access from and to Gaza . \\"Agreement on Movement and Access\\" and \\"Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing\\", 15 November 2005Tanya Reinhart, The Road to Nowhere, Verso, London 2006 pp.134‚Äì5 Following the 2006 Palestinian legislative election in January, that brought Hamas to power in the PA, Israel and the Quartet of the Middle East imposed economic sanctions against the PA after Hamas refused to agree to the Quartet's conditions to maintain economic assistance: recognition of Israel, disavowal of violent actions, and acceptance of previous agreements between Israel and the PA. Though initially opposed by the United States, a Quartet member, the US government agreed in April 2006 to discontinue $400 million of foreign aid to the PA. Instead the US would redirect $100 million to the United Nations and other non-Palestinian groups, but no aid money would be given directly to the government of Mahmoud Abbas. Throughout 2006, the Karni crossing remained only partially operational, costing Palestinians $500,000 a day, as less than 10% of the Gaza Strip's minimal daily export targets were achieved. Basic food commodities were severely depleted, bakeries closed and food rationing was introduced.Report of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.Sixty-first session, Supplement No.35 (A/61/35). October 2005 ‚Äì October 2006, United Nations Publications, New York, p.8 Naval blockade The Israeli Navy enforces a maritime blockade of the Port of Gaza and the coastline. Under the Oslo II Accord, activities of the Palestinian Naval Police are restricted to from the coast. Under the 1994 Gaza‚ÄìJericho Agreement, which was not implemented, Palestinian fishing was to be permitted up to offshore. In 2007, Israel restricted fishermen travel to offshore. Israeli officials said the restrictions were necessary because of past incidents of Palestinians using fishing boats for smuggling and attacks. Israeli patrol boats regularly patrol Gaza's coastline and fire on Palestinian fishing vessels that go beyond the permitted distance from shore. In July 2018, Israel further restricted the Gaza fishing space to .ISRAEL HALTS FLOW OF GAS AND FUEL INTO GAZA Israel has intercepted a number of vessels attempting to bring supplies into Gaza, claiming that they may be providing goods that may be used to build arms. A humanitarian mission organised by the Free Gaza Movement, with Cynthia McKinney and Mairead Maguire on board, was intercepted by Israel attempting to sail to Gaza. They were deported but the supplies were later delivered to Gaza over land by truck. On 29 April 2014, Gaza's Ark, a vessel being converted in Gaza from a fishing boat to carry cargo to Europe, was sunk by an explosion following a telephone warning to the guard, who was uninjured. The organisers of the project suspect that Israel forces are responsible. Between 2000 and 2018, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights has documented 1,283 incidents involving Palestinian fishermen, including 1,192 shooting incidents that led to the death of 8 fishermen and to the injury of 134 fishermen. During these incidents, 656 fishermen were detained, and 209 boats were confiscated. Effect on the fishing industry Al Jazeera report on the effects on the fishing industry The sea blockade has caused damage to Gaza fishing industry. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has estimated that Gaza fishermen need to journey at least 12‚Äì15 nautical miles from shore to catch larger shoals, and sardines in particular are offshore. Shoals closer to shore have been depleted. The total catch pre-blockade in 1999 was nearly 4,000 tons, this was reduced to 2,700 tons in 2008. In the 90s, the Gaza fishing industry was worth $10 million annually or 4% of the total Palestinian economy; this was halved between 2001 and 2006. 45,000 Palestinians were employed in the fishing industry, employed in jobs such as catching fish, repairing nets and selling fish. Fish also provided much-needed animal protein to Gazans' diet. The International Committee of the Red Cross also notes that \\"90% of Gaza's 4000 fishermen are now considered either poor (with a monthly income of between US$100 and US$190) or very poor (earning less than US$100 a month), up from 50% in 2008.\\" Nezar Ayyash, head of Gaza's fishermen's union, is quoted as saying that he has been arrested and his boat confiscated several times. According to the Palestinian Fishermen's Syndicate, there are 3,800 registered fishermen in the Gaza Strip. Only 2,000 of them are currently working as a result of restrictions, constant attacks and growing cost of fishing equipment. Energy restrictions Almost all of Gaza's liquid fuel and about half of its electricity are supplied by Israel, while Gaza's sole power plant runs on crude diesel supplied by Israel. In late October 2007, in response to persistent rocket fire on southern Israel, Israel cut diesel exports to Gaza by 15% and gasoline exports by 10%, and created targeted electrical outages for 15 minutes after a rocket attack. According to Israeli officials, the energy flow to hospitals and Israeli shipments of crude diesel to Gaza's sole power plant would remain unaffected. The Israeli government argued that these limited energy cuts are a non-violent way to protest against Hamas rocket attacks. The following day, Attorney General of Israel Menachem Mazuz suspended the electricity cuts, and the Israeli Supreme Court gave the government three days to justify its energy cuts policy. On 1 December 2007, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the electricity cuts were unlawful, and ordered the Israeli military to stop them by the following day. In its ruling, however, the court allowed Israel to continue reducing its diesel and gasoline shipments to Gaza. Control of Gazan air space The Oslo Accords interim peace agreements expressly give Israel security control over Gazan airspace and coastal waters.JCPA Global Law Forum, International Law and the Fighting in Gaza, Justus Reid Weiner and Avi Bell, 05/01/2009 Gazan air space is controlled by radar. Unmanned aerial surveillance drones regularly patrol, there are regular overflights by Israeli fighter jets and a surveillance balloon is tethered near the Erez crossing.  Palestinian Authority support of blockade actions  Linked with the conflict following his party's loss in the 2006 election, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed his approval of the Egyptian border restrictions by the new regime, purportedly aimed at protecting Egypt from danger. In 2014 and subsequent years, Abbas supported Egypt's crackdown on smuggling tunnels, which were Gaza's last lifeline to the outer world, and he welcomed the flooding of the tunnels by Egypt in coordination with the Palestinian Authority (PA).Abbas 'supports' Egypt action on Gaza tunnels . Al Jazeera, 12 December 2014Sisi says Gaza tunnels flooded in coordination with PA . MEMO, 28 September 2015Abbas: Egypt Right to Create Buffer Zone on Gaza Border . Jack Khoury, Haaretz, 1 December 2014 (premium). ‚Ä≥Abbas believed the destruction of the tunnels was the best solution. The Palestinian president said he had recommended previously the sealing or destruction of the tunnels by flooding them and then punishing the owners of the homes that contained entrances to the tunnels, including demolishing their homes.‚Ä≥ In 2010, Abbas declared that he opposed lifting the Israeli naval blockade of the Gaza Strip because this would bolster Hamas. Egypt also supported this position.Abbas to Obama: I'm against lifting the Gaza naval blockade . Barak Ravid, Haaretz, 13 June 2010 In 2016, Abbas objected to the entrance of Qatari fuel to the Gaza electricity plant via Israel, because his PA would be unable to collect taxes on the fuel.Ya‚Äôalon: Abbas objected to Qatari fuel entering Gaza through Ashdod . MEMO, 17 February 2016 In 2016 most Palestinian parties welcomed Turkish initiatives to end the strict Israeli siege on the Gaza Strip by building a seaport for the movement of people and goods. This step was condemned by Fatah and the PA, a senior Fatah leader saying that his movement would not allow this to happen, while the Fatah Executive Committee said this was an Israeli trick to separate Gaza from the West Bank. In turn a Hamas official condemned the PA's position; \\"This position proves that the PA is part of the Israeli-led siege which has been imposed on Gaza for ten years\\".Palestinian factions welcome Turkish efforts to lift Gaza siege . MEMO, 1 March 2016 In 2017, the PA government imposed its own sanctions against Gaza, including, among other things, cutting off salaries to thousands of PA employees, as well as financial assistance to hundreds of families in the Gaza Strip. The PA initially said it would stop paying for the electricity and fuel that Israel supplies to the Gaza Strip, but after a year partially backtracked.PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY REJECTS ISRAELI, U.S. IDEAS TO HELP GAZA Limitation of basic goods Israel allows limited humanitarian supplies from aid organizations into the Gaza Strip, but not dual-use items, which can also be used for military purposes. According to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories of the Israel Defense Forces, in May 2010, this included over 1.5 million litres of diesel fuel and gasoline, fruits and vegetables, wheat, sugar, meat, chicken and fish products, dairy products, animal feed, hygiene products, clothing and shoes. According to Gisha, items that have at various times been denied importation into Gaza in 2010 include ordinary consumer goods such as jam, candles, books, musical instruments, shampoo, A4 paper, and livestock such as chicken, donkeys, and cows.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs at various times, Israel has blocked goods including wheelchairs, dry food items, and crayons, Stationery, soccer balls, and musical instruments. International aid group Mercy Corps said it was blocked from sending 90 tons of macaroni and other foodstuffs. After international pressure, Israeli authorities said that they were giving the shipment a green light.Dion Nissenbaum. \\"Israel Blocks Pasta Shipment to Gaza, and Tensions Boil\\". McClatchy Newspapers. 26 February 2009. Retrieved 12 July 2009. Archived 23 July 2009. Israel was also reported to have prevented aid groups from sending in other items, such as paper, crayons, tomato paste and lentils. Because of an Israeli ban on the importation of construction materials such as cement and steel, which could be used to build bunkers for military use by Hamas, the UN Relief and Works Agency started to build mud brick homes. Aid agencies say that food waits on trucks and in warehouses, and many basic items are rejected by Israel as \\"luxuries\\" or are turned down for unexplained reasons. \\"Tin\\" cans are banned because the steel from which they are made might be used to build weaponry or structures by Hamas, making it hard for Gazan farmers to preserve their vegetables. At one time the only fruit allowed was bananas. Allegedly because the Israeli official owned a banana plantation. Limitation system In September 2007, the Israeli cabinet voted to tighten the restrictions on the Gaza strip. The cabinet decision stated, \\"the movement of goods into the Gaza Strip will be restricted; the supply of gas and electricity will be reduced; and restrictions will be imposed on the movement of people from the Strip and to it.\\"Hass, Amira. \\"2,279 calories per person: How Israel made sure Gaza didn't starve.\\" Haaretz Newspaper, 17 October 2012.

Banned items also included coriander, shampoo and shoes. In October 2010, papers were released which revealed a system to maintain the minimum level of basic goods entering the Strip. It contained upper and lower warning lines, identifying surpluses and shortages of listed products in Gaza.Israel Releases Papers Detailing Formula of Gaza Blockade . Amira Hass, Haaretz, 26 October 2010 In October 2012, an Israeli court forced Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) to release a document that detailed \\"red lines\\" for \\"food consumption in the Gaza strip\\" during the 2007 blockade. According to the COGAT, the document was a rough draft, and never actually implemented. He want on further to say that there was never even any discussion after the document had been drafted. The document calculates the minimum number of calories necessary to keep Gazans from malnutrition and avoid a humanitarian crisis. This number was converted to a number of daily truckloads, the number being decreased to account for food produced in Gaza, and further on the basis of \\"culture and experience\\" of the Gazans. This reduction, if implemented, would have resulted in an increase in sugar and a decrease in fruits, vegetables, milk, and meat. Gisha, an Israeli human-rights group, said that in fact the number of truckloads allowed into Gaza was less than stipulated in the calculation. The UN said that if the policy was intended to cap food imports, it would go against humanitarian principles. The body responsible for the calculation said its intent was to ensure no shortages occur, not to cap food imports. Israeli officials now acknowledge the restrictions were partly meant to pressure Hamas by making the lives of Gazans difficult. Israel limits the amount of load the trucks may carry, ostensibly for security reasons. In the past, the total height of goods stacked on trucks was not allowed to exceed 1.2 meters. The Israeli authorities did, however, not explain why they did not use to its full potential the scanner, donated by the Dutch government and calibrated according to the military's specifications, which can scan at a height of 2 meters. In February 2016, the allowed height was increased to 1.5 meters.An inch at a time . Gisha, 11 February 2016  Blockade timeline 2007-2010  The Gaza Strip June 2007 ‚Äì January 2008 In June 2007, Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in the Battle of Gaza, and removed Fatah officials. Following the Hamas takeover, the sanctions put in place after Hamas's 2006 electoral victory were dramatically tightened. Truck transits, which had been 12,000 per month in 2005, were reduced to 2,000 by November of that year, when in a further measure, in the context of Hamas rocket fire and Israeli attacks, food supplies were halved, fuel imports slashed and foreign currency restricted by the latter.RULING PALESTINE I: GAZA UNDER HAMAS,' Middle East Report N¬∞73, International Crisis Group 19 March 2008 In response to the violent clashes, President Abbas declared a state of emergency and dissolved the national unity government on 14 June. Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh called this decision \\"hasty\\", and pledged to stay in power. Hamas gained complete control of the Gaza Strip by 15 June, forcing out Fatah. Following the takeover, Egypt and Israel largely sealed their border crossings with Gaza, on the grounds that Fatah had fled and was no longer providing security on the Palestinian side. In July 2007, Israeli officials stated they had been planning to open the Rafah border crossing in order to allow stranded Palestinians to return, but claimed that this plan had been cancelled after Hamas threatened to fire on the refugees. A Jerusalem Post article mentioned Hamas' complaints that since June 2008 the P.A. no longer granted passports to Gazans, thereby \\"preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from being able to travel abroad\\". Egypt, fearing a spill-over of Hamas-style militancy into their territory, kept its border with Gaza largely sealed. Israel sealed the border completely on 17 January in response to rocket attacks on southern Israel and Palestinian militant attacks on crossing points between Israel and Gaza. The Egyptian government feared also that Iran wanted to establish a base in its territory as well as in Gaza through its proxy Hizbullah following the 2009 Hezbollah plot in Egypt. January 2008 breach of the Gaza-Egypt border On 22 January 2008, Palestinians clashed with Egyptian police in front of the border, demanding that the Rafah Border Crossing be opened. The clashes included live fire, and there were injuries on both sides. Fifty women managed to cross, and Egyptian police responded with a water cannon assault. Additional Egyptian security forces arrived, and managed to restore calm and prevent Palestinians from crossing.Al Jazeera English ‚Äì Gazans clash with Egyptian police at Rafah ‚Äì 22 January 08 The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The United Nations estimated that as many as half of the population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies. Israel said that militants had exploited the breach in the border wall to send armed men into the Sinai to infiltrate Israel across the Sinai- Israel border. Egyptian troops at first permitted the crossing but did not allow Palestinians to travel further than El Arish. On 25 January, Egyptian forces blocked almost all illegal entry points to stem the flow of Gazans pouring in, and Egyptian riot police erected barbed wire and chain-link fences along the border. Palestinians used a bulldozer to knock down the fence and once again flooded in. Egyptian border police began stopping Palestinians from crossing and sealed the road from Rafah to El Arish. On 28 January, Egyptian security forces and Hamas militants strung barbed wire across one of the breaches, sealing it off. The Egyptians began repairing one of the two remaining breaches on 29 January, and closed the border with the Gaza Strip on 3 February 2008. Mid-2008 violence Throughout mid-2008, Israel continued to inspect all humanitarian aid for Gaza and delivering approved items through the Karni, Kerem Shalom, Erez, and Sufa crossing points. Throughout this period, Hamas launched raids against these crossing points. The first was a 9 April infiltration by four Hamas fighters through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. The four fighters attacked a terminal in Nahal Oz being used to deliver fuel to Gaza, killing two workers. Three of the fighters were subsequently killed by Israeli strikes as they attempted to flee. On 19 April, Hamas launched another attack against a border crossing in the early morning hours. Three fighters were killed in the operation, and thirteen Israeli soldiers were wounded. June 2008 attempt at easing restrictions Under a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in June 2008, Israel agreed to lift its blockade of Gaza Strip. At Egypt's request, Israel did not always respond to Palestinian ceasefire violations by closing the border. Israel accused Hamas of transporting weapons into Gaza via tunnels to Egypt, failing to stop rocket attacks, and noted that Hamas would not continue negotiating the release of Israeli hostage Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas since 2006. Hamas' decision alienated it from the government of Egypt, which had linked the opening of the Gaza-Egypt border crossing to Shalit's release.Hamas says not interested in renewing Shalit negotiations By Avi Issacharoff and Amos Harel.

In August 2008, the first NGO-organized attempts to breach Israel's maritime closure of the Gaza Strip occurred when two vessels, containing activists from the Free Gaza Movement and International Solidarity Movement, sailed from Cyprus towards Gaza, carrying hearing aids and balloons. The boats reached Gaza on 23 August 2008 after the Israeli government allowed the boats free passage. Four more voyages occurred from October until December 2008, as passengers were transported another boat called the \\"Dignity\\", a 66-foot yacht owned by the Free Gaza Movement. The Dignity was rammed three times while it was sailing in international waters by the Israeli Navy and significant damage was incurred. On 28 October 2008, the Dignity, carrying 26 activists and medical supplies, docked in a strip harbor without interference. Israel had initially decided to stop the vessel, but the decision was made to let it through just before it reached Gaza. The Dignity sailed to Gaza four times before it was attacked on 30 December 2008 in international waters, as it sailed towards Gaza to deliver medicine and medical help. In August 2008, it was reported that Israel despite the ceasefire was still allowing in very few goods. A WikiLeaks cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv dated 3 November 2008 revealed that Israel still maintained the economy of the Gaza strip \\"on the brink of collapse\\" without \\"pushing it over the edge,\\". The cable said that \\"Israeli officials have confirmed to Embassy officials on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis.\\"Israel Deliberately Choked Gaza Economy: WikiLeaks . AFP, 5 January 2010 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza war and aftermath An explosion caused by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza during the Gaza War. In January 2009, after the first phase of the Gaza War, Israel said it would allow in some humanitarian aid, but will continue its economic blockade in order to weaken the power of Hamas. In June 2009, on the second anniversary of the blockade, 38 United Nations and non-governmental humanitarian organisations issued a joint press release calling for \\"free and uninhibited access for all humanitarian assistance in accordance with the international agreements and in accordance with universally recognised international human rights and humanitarian law standards\\". As of July 2009, Israel said it is making the humanitarian relief efforts in Gaza one of its top priorities. The amount of goods Israel allows into Gaza is one quarter of the pre- blockade flow. Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated \\"We want to make sure that reconstruction for the people of Gaza is not reconstruction for the Hamas regime.\\" U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said on 25 February that \\"Aid should never be used as a political weapon. We'll try to push to get into Gaza as many supplies as possible.\\" Rafah border crossing ‚Äì British aid convoy entering Gaza Strip from Egypt in 2009. The Olmert cabinet had decided in March 2009 that food and medical supplies to Gaza would be allowed through unfettered. This was met with resistance by Israel's Defense Ministry, which controls the border crossings. An Israeli military spokesperson said that each item was decided on an individual basis and that food was being let through daily. According to NGO Gisha, the amount of food entering Gaza is as of May 2009, about 25% of the pre-June 2007 figures. A UN study has found that Gazan families are eating fewer meals a day and mainly relying on carbohydrates such as rice and flour because protein foods are expensive or unavailable. Chicken eggs have doubled in price due to the destruction of chicken coops during the Gaza War. February 2009 Hamas-UNRWA incident On 3 February, 3,500 blankets and over 400 food parcels were confiscated by Hamas police personnel from an UNRWA distribution center. On the following day, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator demanded that the aid be returned immediately. In a separate incident on 5 February, Hamas seized 200 tons of food from UNRWA aid supplies. The following day, UNRWA suspended its activities in Gaza. Hamas issued a statement stating that the incident was a misunderstanding between the drivers of the trucks and had been resolved through direct contact with the UNRWA. On 9 February, UNRWA lifted the suspension on the movement of its humanitarian supplies into Gaza, after the Hamas authorities returned all of the aid supplies confiscated.

May 2010 Gaza flotilla raid On 31 May 2010 the Israeli Navy seized an aid convoy of six ships known as the \\"Gaza Freedom Flotilla\\". aiming to break through the blockade, carrying humanitarian aid and construction materials. The flotilla had declined an Israeli request to change course to the port of Ashdod, where the Israeli government had said it would inspect the aid and deliver (or let humanitarian organizations deliver) Israeli-approved items to Gaza. Pictured here: Knives, wrenches, and wooden clubs used to attack the soldiers during the 2010 Gaza flotilla raid. Seen here are many boxes of expired medicine which were to be delivered as aid by the 2010 Gaza flotilla. Much of the cargo was like this. Israeli Shayetet 13 naval commandos boarded the ships from speedboats and helicopters launched from three missile ships, while the flotilla was still in international waters. On the MV Mavi Marmara, the main ship of the convoy, passengers attacked and managed to capture three soldiers. Israeli soldiers responded with rubber bullets and live ammunition from soldiers in helicopters and on the ship. Israel was accused of using disproportionate force with a number of people shot from behind. On other ships, soldiers were met with passive resistance which was easily suppressed with non-lethal techniques. Nine passengers were killed and dozens wounded. Nine soldiers were also injured, two of them seriously. All of the ships were seized and towed to Ashdod, while passengers were imprisoned in Israel and then deported to their home countries. The MV Rachel Corrie, a seventh ship that had been delayed, set sail from Malta on the same day of the flotilla's interception. Israeli naval vessels shadowed the Rachel Corrie, and after it ignored three warnings, Israeli commandos boarded the ship from speedboats, arrested the crew, and forced it to sail to Ashdod. Freedom Flotilla II Following the Gaza flotilla raid, a coalition of 22 NGOs assembled in July 2011 a flotilla of 10 vessels and 1,000 activists to breach the blockade. The vessels docked in Greece in preparation for the journey to Gaza. However, the Greek government announced that it would not allow the vessels to leave for Gaza, and the Hellenic Coast Guard stopped three vessels attempting to evade the travel ban and leave port. On 7 July, most activists left for home, leaving only a few dozen to continue the initiative. On 16 July, the French yacht Dignite Al Karama was allowed to leave port after informing Greek authorities that its destination was Alexandria, Egypt. Instead, the yacht headed directly for Gaza. The Israeli Navy stopped the Dignite Al Karama about 65 kilometers off Gaza. After the boat was warned and refused to turn back, it was surrounded by three Israeli naval vessels and boarded by Shayetet 13 commandos, who took it over. The boat was then taken to Ashdod. Ultimately, the Freedom Flotilla sailing did not take place. Third Flotilla On 4 November 2011, the Israeli Navy intercepted two vessels heading towards Gaza in a private initiative to break the blockade. Shayetet 13 commandos boarded the vessels from speedboats and took them over with no resistance. The vessels were then taken to Ashdod port. June 2010 easing of the blockade Facing mounting international calls to ease or lift their blockade in response to the Gaza flotilla raid, Egypt and Israel lessened the restrictions starting in June 2010. Israel announced that it will allow all strictly civilian goods into Gaza while preventing weapons and what it designates as \\"dual-use\\" items from entering Gaza. Egypt partly opened the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza, primarily for people, but not for supplies, to go through. The Israeli NGO Gisha Legal Center for Freedom of Movement reported in a July 2010 publication that Israel continues to prevent normal functioning of the Gazan economy. Israel continues to severely restrict and/or prevent people from entering or exiting Gaza according to Gisha. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the humanitarian impact of the easing of the blockage in January and February 2011 and concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people's livelihoods. The World Bank estimated in 2015 that the GDP losses caused by the blockade since 2007 was above 50%, and entailed large welfare losses. On 1 June 2010, the Rafah border crossing from Egypt to Gaza was partially opened. Egypt's foreign ministry has made it clear that the crossing will remain open mainly for people, not for aid, to go through. Several aid trucks began making it into Gaza during the following morning including some carrying power generators from the Egyptian Red Crescent, and hundreds of Gazans who had been staying in Egypt returned home, although little traffic, human or cargo, flowed from Gaza to Egypt.Shenker, Jack (2 June 2010). \\"Opening Rafah crossing as lifeline for Gaza poses dilemma for Egypt\\" . The Guardian (UK) On 3 June, the manager of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing, Salameh Barakeh, explained that the crossing is open for the free travel of patients, foreign passport holders, those with residency status in other countries, students and internationals.Rafah crossing open for third consecutive day , Ma'an News Agency, 3 June 2010 The Arab Physicians Union officials submitted a request to Egyptian authorities on 3 June 2010 to send 400 tons of food, blankets, electric generators for hospitals and construction material from Egypt to Gaza, but their request was denied by Egyptian authorities without specific reason. Emad Gad, political analyst at Egyptian Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, believes the government should keep the Rafah border under control because opening it completely could allow weapons smuggling or illegal financial transactions.A Crack in the Blockade, Egypt Today, July 2010 On 17 June 2010, Israel's Prime Minister's Office announced that Israel's security cabinet had agreed to relax Israel's blockade on the Gaza Strip, and issued an English-language press release, according to which a decision to ease the blockade had been made. The English text reads: \\"It was agreed to liberalize the system by which civilian goods enter Gaza [and] expand the inflow of materials for civilian projects that are under international supervision.\\" However, no binding decision has been made during the cabinet meeting, and an announcement issued in Hebrew did not mention any such decision. The Prime Minister's office said that a meeting would be held soon, and expressed hope that a binding decision will be taken then. On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would \\"expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more ‚Äì as well as (projects) that are under international supervision.\\" Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel announced its intention to continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod. Internationally, this decision received mixed reactions. International Response to Easing of Restrictions Tony Blair, who welcomed Israel's decision to ease the restrictions on behalf of the Quartet on the Middle East, said that the Quartet ‚Äì the UN, US, EU, and Russia ‚Äì would continue talks with Israel \\"to flesh out the principles\\". Suggesting that \\"items of ordinary daily life, including materials for the construction of homes, infrastructure and services as the UN have asked\\" should be allowed to enter Gaza, he stated that \\"the decision to allow foodstuffs and household items is a good start\\". A spokesperson for the Secretary-General of the United Nations declared that the Secretary-General would be encouraged that the Israeli government is reviewing its policy towards Gaza. He added that the United Nations would continue to seek a fundamental change in policy as agreed by the Quartet. Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri said that Israel's decision would have been designed to \\"beautify\\" the blockade and mislead public opinion. A British Foreign Office spokesman said: \\"It is good that Israel is giving serious consideration to resolving these issues, [b]ut further work is needed. We need to see the additional steps still to be announced.\\" EU officials also said they were disappointed by the decision. German Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development Dirk Niebel said that the Israeli announcement was \\"not sufficient\\". During a visit to the country, Niebel intended to visit a sewage treatment plant being financed with German development aid, but was denied entry into the Gaza strip by Israel. He commented that the Israeli government sometimes would \\"not make it easy for its friends to explain why it behaves the way it does.\\" A spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry responded that Israel would have been obliged to allow any other European minister entry if it had allowed Niebel to visit the Gaza strip, thus conferring additional legitimacy to the Hamas government. (\\"Had we allowed Niebel to enter, we would be under an obligation to allow any other European minister entry. This would confer additional legitimacy to the Hamas government,\\" a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry told the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung.) Chris Gunness from UNRWA criticised Israel's move to ease the blockade as not being adequate, saying that \\"Even if the blockade is eased it remains illegal under international law as it is a collective form of punishment on a civilian population. Eighty percent of Gaza's population is aid-dependent. Allowing more aid in is perpetuating this dependency and not addressing the issue of self- sufficiency or the root causes of the crisis. What have not been addressed by the easing of the closure are the issues of exports as well as the limited number of crossings open to facilitate the flow of goods. Operation Cast Lead destroyed at least 60,000 homes and structures which need to be urgently repaired and rebuilt. The easing of the blockade is not addressing this adequately.\\" Maxwell Gaylard, UN Deputy Special and Humanitarian Coordinator for the Middle East also criticised Israel, saying \\"Permitting mayonnaise and potato chips into Gaza is really irrelevant in dealing with the underlying issues. What we need to see is an improvement in Gaza's water, sanitation, power grid, educational and health sectors. Gaza's economy is shot to pieces and its infrastructure is extremely fragile.\\" New blockade policy by Israel On 20 June 2010, Israel's Security Cabinet approved a new system governing the blockade that would allow practically all non-military or dual-use items to enter the Gaza strip. According to a cabinet statement, Israel would \\"expand the transfer of construction materials designated for projects that have been approved by the Palestinian Authority, including schools, health institutions, water, sanitation and more ‚Äì as well as (projects) that are under international supervision.\\" Despite the easing of the land blockade, Israel will continue to inspect all goods bound for Gaza by sea at the port of Ashdod. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the decision enabled Israel to focus on real security issues and would eliminate \\"Hamas' main propaganda claim,\\" and that it would strengthen the case for keeping the sea blockade in place. He also said the decision would have been coordinated with the United States and with Tony Blair, the representative of the Quartet for the Middle East. Blair characterized the decision as a \\"very significant step forward\\", but added that the decision needs to be implemented. In a statement, the Quartet said that the situation remained \\"unsustainable and unacceptable\\" and maintained that a long-term solution was urgently needed. The UNRWA called for a complete lift of the Gaza blockade, expressing concern that the new policy would continue to limit Gaza's ability to develop on its own. The European Union's representative for foreign policy, Catherine Ashton, welcomed the decision. She called the step \\"a significant improvement\\" and expressed the expectation that the measures take effect as soon as possible, adding that \\"more work remains to be done.\\" The U.S. government welcomed the decision, expressing the belief that the easing would significantly improve the lives of Gaza Strip residents and prevent weapons smuggling. It expressed its intention to contribute to an international effort to \\"explore additional ways to improve the situation in Gaza, including greater freedom of movement and commerce between Gaza and the West Bank.\\" Hamas dismissed the measures as trivial and \\"media propaganda\\", and demanded a complete lifting of the blockade, including the removal on all restrictions on the import of construction material. Israeli Arab member of Knesset Hanin Zoabi commented that the easing of the blockade would prove that \\"it is not a security blockade, but a political one,\\" adding that the flotilla \\"succeeded in undermining the blockade's legitimacy.\\" The U.S., United Nations, European Union and Russia in 2010 were jointly consulting with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Egypt on additional measures, described by the United States Department of State as a \\"fundamental change in policy\\" toward the Gaza strip. Lieberman Proposal In July 2010, Israel's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman proposed an initiative to shift full responsibility over the Gaza Strip to the international community. He announced that he plans to discuss the idea, which was labeled a \\"personal initiative\\" with the EU Foreign Minister Catherine Ashton.\\"Let Gaza go\\" ‚Äì Israeli Foreign Minister. The Voice of Russia, 16 July 2010 Lieberman proposed that units of the French Foreign Legion and commando units from EU member states be sent in to secure the Gaza border crossings to prevent the smuggling of weapons, and that the border with Israel be sealed. Ships that underwent inspections in Cyprus or Greece would be allowed to dock in Gaza and unload humanitarian cargoes. The EU would help improve and build civilian infrastructure, and Gaza would become a fully independent entity.FM presents: 2nd disengagement from Gaza, Shimon Shiffer, Ynet 16 July 2010 Humanitarian impact assessment In January and February 2011, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) conducted an assessment of the effects of the measures to ease the access restrictions. They concluded that they did not result in a significant improvement in people's livelihoods. They found that a limited reactivation of the private sector resulted from the increased availability of consumer goods and some raw materials but the \\"pivotal nature of the remaining restrictions\\" and the effects of three years of strict blockade prevented a significant improvement in livelihoods. Although the unemployment rate in Gaza fell from 39.3% to 37.4% in the second half of 2010 there were significant food price rises. There was little or no improvement in food insecurity rates in Gaza which continued to affect 52% of the population. Few of the 40,000 housing units needed to replace homes lost during Operation Cast Lead and for natural population growth could be built as a result of the ongoing restrictions on importing building materials. The approval of over 100 projects funded by international organizations intended to improve the \\"extremely deteriorated\\" water and sanitation, education and health services, followed the easing of the blockade. The implementation of these projects was delayed by the entry approval process for materials and the limited opening of the Karni crossing. OCHA found that there had been no improvement in the quality of services provided to the population of the Gaza Strip as a result of the projects so far. There was no significant increase in the number of exit permits granted by Israel to allow access to the outside world including other parts of the Palestinian territories. Permits continued to be issued by Israel only on an exceptional basis with 106-114 per day being issued during the second half of 2010. OCHA described Egypt's move to regularly operate its crossing with Gaza for special categories of people as a \\"significant, albeit limited, improvement\\". They concluded that the easing of restrictions was \\"a step in the right direction\\" but called on Israel to fully abolish the blockade including removing restrictions on the import of construction materials and the exports of goods, and to lift the general ban on the movement of people between Gaza and the West Bank via Israel in order to comply with what they described as international humanitarian and human rights law obligations. According to the World Health Organization, the shortage of essential medicines and equipment has been the primary obstacle to providing adequate health care in the Gaza Strip since the 2012 conflict. Gazan hospitals had a shortage of more than 50% of \\"medical consumables\\" even before the conflict. Workers in some hospitals reported having to sterilize and re-use single-use equipment due to the lack of critical items. Palestinian hospitals are unable to meet the need of their patients due to economic underdevelopment and the varying strictness of the Israeli blockade. According to B'Tselem, the blockade, which not only restricts Gazans' access to Israel but also communication between Gaza and the West Bank, has denied Gazan fishermen access to 85% of the waters they have been guaranteed access to.Palestinian freedom of movement During the 2014 Israel-Gaza Conflict, 108,000 people were displaced, almost all of whom are still living in UNWRA refugee camps or inadequate improvised shelters. 28 schools, numerous wells, and other important civil infrastructure like major sewage and electricity plants were destroyed during Operation Protective Edge. Since then over 2,000 truckloads of materials for reconstruction have been allowed into Gaza, but according to a UN estimate, 735 truckloads per day, for three years, would be necessary to rebuild all the damaged infrastructure.  Further easing (2011‚Äì2013)  Following the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Egypt for some time opened the Rafah border crossing permanently as of 28 May 2011. A limited number of women of all ages and men aged below 18 and above 40 were able to enter Egypt without a visa, although there are still severe restrictions on the movement of personnel and goods to and from Gaza. In 2012 Egypt started supplying fuel to the Gaza Strip, to help ease a lengthy fuel crisis arising from a dispute between Egypt and the Hamas government in Gaza over whether Gaza can trade with Egypt openly, or only via Israel. In 2013 Israel has eased its regulation on the entering of construction material into Gaza. The regulation was an attempt to reduce rocket fire in the south. Prior to a Gaza visit, scheduled for April 2013, Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan explained to Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet that the fulfilment of three conditions by Israel was necessary for friendly relations to resume between Turkey and Israel: an apology for the raid (Prime Minister Netanyahu had delivered an apology to Erdogan by telephone on 22 March 2013), the awarding of compensation to the families affected by the raid, and the lifting of the Gaza blockade by Israel. The Turkish prime minister also explained in the H√ºrriyet interview, in relation to the April 2013 Gaza visit, \\"We will monitor the situation to see if the promises are kept or not.\\" At the same time, Netanyahu affirmed that Israel would only consider exploring the removal of the Gaza blockade if peace (\\"quiet\\") is achieved in the area. Land blockade The Muslim Brotherhood in the Egyptian parliament wished to open trade across the border with Gaza in 2012, a move said to be resisted by Egypt's Tantawi government. Goods blocked According to the \\"Failing Gaza\\", Amnesty International and other organizations reported that cement, glass, steel, bitumen, wood, paint, doors, plastic pipes, metal pipes, metal reinforcement rods, aggregate, generators, high voltage cables and wooden telegraph poles were \\"high priority reconstruction materials currently with no or highly limited entry into Gaza through official crossings.\\" A 2009 UN report by Kevin M. Cahill called the restrictions \\"Draconian\\", and said that reconstruction efforts were being undermined by Israel's refusal to permit the importation of steel, cement or glass, among other building materials, and its policy of restricted importation of lentils, pasta, tomato paste and juice, as well as batteries for hearing aids for deaf children. He said that despite the restrictions, UNRWA had been able to provide a basic food supply to over a million refugees in the Gaza Strip. He added that he \\"visited a food station where hundreds of displaced persons waited to collect their meager staples of rice, sugar, lentils and cooking oil. While this program may save people from starvation, it is a diet that does not prevent the highest level of anemia in the region, with alarming rates of childhood stunting due to inadequate nutrition.\\" The Palestinians who negotiated the 2008 cease-fire believed that commerce in Gaza was to be restored to the levels preceding Israel's 2005 withdrawal and Hamas's electoral victory.Gaza Truce May Be Revived by Necessity .

By Heather Sharp. BBC News. Published 11 November 2008. Fuel supplies increased from 55MW worth to 65MW worth. BBC News reported on 11 November that Gaza was then receiving only 28% of the amount of goods traded before the Hamas takeover. Over the one-month period from 4 November to 8 December, approximately 700 truck loads of goods went into Gaza, accounting for approximately 1/40th of estimated pre-blockade commerce.John Nichols. Jimmy Carter on \\"An Unnecessary War\\" . The Nation. 8 January 2009. Israel stated that food imports into the Strip were limited by its inability to operate at border checkpoints. It accused Hamas of exacerbating fuel shortages by leading labor union strikes by power plant workers. It has also accused Hamas of underfunding the Gaza health care system, and then blaming the situation on Israel despite supposed free trade of medical supplies. Shipments of permitted medical supplies have expired due to the lengthy process required for passage through border crossings, requiring their destruction.Egyptian authorities forced to burn expired Gaza aid Ma'an News Agency 10 July 2009. Retrieved 12 July 2009. Archived 23 July 2009. Israel states that travel restrictions on Gazans is necessary to protect national security, citing the cases of three Gazans who claimed to require medical attention in Israel but who were in fact planning attacks in Israel. Tunnels Smuggling tunnel in Rafah, 2009 The Gaza smuggling tunnels are mainly located at Rafah, on the border with Egypt. The tunnels connect the Egyptian town of Rafah with the Palestinian refugee camp of Rafah. As a result of the blockade, these tunnels became a vital supply artery for Gaza.An inside look at the tunnels under Gaza and the men who risk their lives to bring in essential supplies . Al Jazeera, 21 April 2014 They are used for various purposes, such to transport people (in and out) and commercial materials like medicine, food and clothes, cigarettes, alcohol, and vehicle parts into Gaza.YNet News: \\"IDF strikes Gaza smuggling tunnel\\" BBC News: \\"Four Palestinians die in Gaza-Egypt 'tunnel collapse'\\" They are also used to smuggle illegal arms (including rockets, mortars and explosives) to Gaza militants. Often cars are sliced into four parts and transported across and re-assembled in Gaza.al-Mughrabi, Nida. Israel, Egypt squeeze Gaza tunnel business , Reuters, 19 November 2009. Ahead of the Islamic festival, Eid al- Adha, they were used to transport live cattle. According to a tunnel operator, Israel bombards tunnels from the air, while Egypt either pumps poisonous gases and water or detonates explosives to destroy tunnels. During the Gaza War, Israel destroyed most of the tunnels, reducing their number to 150 (from 3,000) as of late 2009. Egypt is constructing an underground steel barrier to prevent circumvention of the blockade through tunnels. The UN estimates unemployment has risen from 32.5% in September, to around 40%. In addition to people directly employed by tunnels, the shortage of materials has stopped the majority of construction projects in Gaza and left many jobless. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'√©tat, Egypt's military has destroyed most of the 1,200 tunnels used for smuggling food, weapons and other goods into Gaza.Egypt bans Hamas activities in Egypt . Reuters. 4 Mar 2014 After the August 2013 Rabaa Massacre in Egypt, the border crossing was closed 'indefinitely'. =Buffer zone= In October 2014, days after an attack in which 33 Egyptian soldiers were killed, Egypt announced it may create a buffer zone between Palestinian Rafah and Egyptian Rafah, where most tunnels were believed to be. Initially, the width of the buffer zone was 500 meter but on 18 November 2014, Egypt said it would expand it to 1 km. On 29 December 2014, the buffer zone was extended again to 5 km. Egyptian authorities began implementing phase two in the flattening of large swaths of Egyptian Rafah where over 2,000 families lived, and widened the buffer zone. According to Egyptian reports, the second phase involved destroying everything standing across an additional 500 meters from the border area, on top of the 500 meters already cleared several months earlier. Effects of land blockade on Gaza There have been several reports and studies analysing the effect of the blockade on Gaza. In July 2008, an UNRWA report on the situation in Gaza stated that \\"the number of households in Gaza below the consumption poverty line continued to grow, reaching 51.8% in 2007 (from 50.7% in 2006)\\". In the same year, a Palestinian Bureau of Statistics study concluded that 80% of families in Gaza were living below the poverty line. A World Health Organization assessment conducted in 2009 claimed that the level of anemia in babies (9‚Äì12 months) was as high as 65%, while a Socio-economic and Food Security Survey Report stated that 61% of Gazans are food insecure and reliant on humanitarian aid. Of those that are food insecure, 65% are children under 18 years. Lastly, a European Network of Implementing Development Agencies (EUNIDA) report notes that, because of the security buffer zone imposed around Gaza as part of the blockade, as of June 2009, 46% of agricultural land was either inaccessible or out of production. On 14 June 2010, the International Committee of the Red Cross noted that the increasing scarcity of items has led to rises in cost of goods while quality has fallen. There is also \\"an acute electricity crisis\\", where electricity supplies are \\"interrupted for seven hours a day on average\\". As a consequence, they note that public services, particularly health services, have suffered, posing \\"a serious risk to the treatment of patients\\". In addition, medical equipment is difficult to repair, and medical staff cannot leave to gain more training. Lastly, the ICRC note that sanitation is suffering, because construction projects lack the equipment needed, or the equipment is of poor quality. Only 60% of the population is connected to a sewerage collection system, with the rest polluting the Gaza aquifer. As a result, water is largely \\"unfit for consumption\\". A 25 May 2010 United Nations Development Programme report stated that, as a result of the blockade, most of Gaza's manufacturing industry has closed, and unemployment stood at an estimated 40%, a decrease on previous years. The blockade has also prevented much needed construction, noting that almost \\"none of the 3,425 homes destroyed during Cast Lead have been reconstructed, displacing around 20,000 people\\". Less than 20% \\"of the value of the damages to educational facilities has been repaired\\", only \\"half of the damage to the power network has been repaired\\", \\"no repair has been made to the transport infrastructure\\", \\"a quarter of damaged farmland has been rehabilitated and only 40% of private businesses have been repaired\\". An August 2012 report by UNRWA of the blockade's effects and general trends in Gaza forecasted that the region's population growth would outpace developments in economic infrastructure. In its press release, UN humanitarian coordinator Maxwell Gaylard said, \\"Gaza will have half a million more people by 2020 while its economy will grow only slowly. In consequence, the people of Gaza will have an even harder time getting enough drinking water and electricity, or sending their children to school.\\" A UN OCHA 2015 report stated that \\"longstanding access restrictions imposed by Israel have undermined Gaza‚Äôs economy, resulting in high levels of unemployment, food insecurity and aid dependency,\\" and that \\"Israeli restrictions on the import of basic construction materials and equipment have significantly deteriorated the quality of basic services, and impede the reconstruction and repair of homes.\\" Economic effects Following the implementation of the blockade, Israel halted all exports from the Gaza Strip. Israeli human rights organization Gisha, the Legal Center for Freedom of Movement, obtained an Israeli government document which says \\"A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, or that it wishes to operate using 'economic warfare,' \\". Sari Bashi, the director of Gisha, said that this showed that Israel wasn't imposing its blockade for its stated reasons of a security measure to prevent weapons from entering Gaza, but rather as collective punishment for the Palestinian population of Gaza. In November 2010, the Israeli government allowed Gaza to resume agricultural exports, while still banning industrial exports. Shortly afterward, Gazan farmers began exporting strawberries, peppers, carnations, and cherry tomatoes. The exports travel to Europe via Israel, and Israel then transfers the money to agricultural cooperatives, which in turn pay the Palestinian farmers. The exports were implemented with aid from the Netherlands, which was monitored by the Israeli defense establishment. It is estimated that in November, less than 20,000 liters of fuel per week entered Gaza via the tunnels, compared to nearly 1 million liters per day until June 2013. The Gaza Power Plant (GPP), which until recently supplied 30 percent of the electricity available in Gaza, has been exclusively dependent on Egyptian diesel smuggled through the tunnels, since early 2011. On 1 November, after depleting its fuel reserves, the GPP was forced to shut down triggering power outages of up to 16 hours per day, up from 8‚Äì12 hours prior to that. The World Bank estimated in 2015 that the GDP losses caused by the blockade since 2007 was above 50%, and entailed large welfare losses. Gaza's manufacturing sector, once significant, shrunk by as much as 60 percent in real terms, due to the wars in the past 20 years and the blockade. Gaza's exports virtually disappeared since the imposition of the 2007 blockade. It stated that \\"solutions have to be found to enable faster inflow of construction materials into Gaza\\", while taking into account \\"legitimate security concerns of neighboring countries.\\" Legal analyses The blockade has been criticized by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and other human rights organizations. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is the guardian of international humanitarian law, the law applicable in situations of armed conflict. This special role of the ICRC is now formally recognized in the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which have been adopted both by the components of the Movement and by the States party to the Geneva Conventions, that is, practically all the world's States. Article 5 of the Statutes states that the role of the ICRC is \\"to undertake the tasks incumbent upon it under the Geneva Conventions, to work for the faithful application of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to take cognizance of any complaints based on alleged breaches of that law\\" (Article 5.2c), and also \\"to work for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to prepare any development thereof\\" (Article 5.2g). The ICRC termed Israel's blockade of Gaza \\"collective punishment\\" in violation of international humanitarian law. In 2010 it also called the blockade a violation of the Geneva Conventions and called for its lifting. These views are supported by further legal analyses. A multi-referenced University of California, Hastings College of the Law analysis recorded: > \\"Under customary international law, a blockade is an act of war. It is > employed to cut off communications and supplies of an enemy. While the modem > concept extends beyond its original and exclusive maritime roots to include > both land and technological blockades, the consistent feature is that a > blockade's purpose has been to deprive a military adversary of necessary > supplies. A belligerent imposing a blockade upon a region consisting of a > civilian population must allow the free passage of relief consignments to > the civilian population. In fact, the legality of a blockade under customary > international law hinges on the requirement that aid for the civilian > population be met with free passage.

Israel's duties to \\"protected persons\\" as an occupier of the > Gaza Strip under Article 55 of the Fourth Geneva Convention require that it > allow the passage of all aid, foodstuffs, and water given the severity of > the humanitarian crisis.

Reactions Israel Since 2005 Israel asserts that it ended its occupation of Gaza when it disengaged from the coastal strip in 2005.International Law and Gaza: The Assault on Israel's Right to Self-Defense , Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Vol. 7, No. 29, 28 January 2008.Israeli MFA Address by Israeli Foreign Minister Livni to the 8th Herzliya Conference , Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel), 22 January 2008. After Israel's unilateral disengagement plan from the Gaza strip, Israel no longer has troops stationed within Gaza. Israel has retained control over Gaza's airspace and coastline, and over its own border with the territory. Egypt has control of its border with Gaza. Israel and Egypt also control the flow of goods in and out. Israel controls fuel imports to Gaza, and also controls the majority of electricity used in Gaza (approximately 60%), which it supplies from the Israeli electrical grid.Israel court backs Gaza fuel cuts , 30 November 2007 There have been a series of attacks by Israeli ground forces such as the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, as well as rocket attacks on Israel and cross- border attacks by Gazan militant groups against Israeli troops. In September 2007, citing an intensification of Qassam rocket attacks, Israel restricted the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. Israel stated that the purpose of the blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. Israel argues that it is not legally responsible for Gaza beyond whatever is necessary to avoid a humanitarian crisis. A US Congressional Research Service report claimed 'While there are differing views in Israel concerning the Gaza blockade ... most Israelis equate security with survival and peace. Israel's leaders appear to believe that the blockade of the Gaza Strip [among other security and deterrence measures], have brought about a quiet. ... As of the date of the Gaza flotilla incident, no Israeli had been killed in a terrorist or in a cross-border rocket attack in more than a year. Therefore, the Israeli government is reluctant to abandon the blockade tactic ... from its perspective.'Congressional Research Service, 23 June 2010: CRS Report for Congress: Israel‚Äôs Blockade of Gaza, the Mavi Marmara Incident, and Its Aftermath , pp. 4‚Äì5 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained that the blockade is necessary to prevent weapons from reaching Gaza. He said, \\"(I)t‚Äôs our obligation‚Äîas well as our right in accordance to international law and to common sense‚Äîto prevent these weapons from entering by air, sea, and land.\\" Referring to the Gaza flotilla, he added, \\"Had the blockade been breached, this flotilla would have been followed by dozens, by hundreds of ships. The amount of weapons that can be transported aboard a ship is totally different from what we saw get through the tunnels.\\" He argued that the consequences of Israel's failure to maintain the blockade would be \\"an Iranian port in Gaza, only a few dozen kilometers from Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.\\" An Israeli government document stated, > A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic > relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict, > or that it wishes to operate using 'economic warfare'. An Israeli government spokesman added in 2010 that the blockade is intended to bring about a political goal and that Israel \\"could not lift the embargo altogether as long as Hamas remains in control\\" of Gaza. Speaking in 2006, Dov Weisglass, an advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, allegedly said that, \\"The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.\\" Although this quote is widely reported, the original quote appears to have been: \\"It's like an appointment with a dietician. The Palestinians will get a lot thinner, but won't die.\\" Weisglass has denied this report. According to US diplomatic cables obtained by the WikiLeaks organization, diplomats stationed in the US embassy in Tel Aviv were briefed by Israelis on the blockade of the Gaza Strip. One of the cables states that \\"as part of their overall embargo plan against Gaza, Israeli officials have confirmed (...) on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over the edge\\". Egypt Egypt's argument is that it cannot open Rafah crossing unless the Palestinian Authority headed by Mahmoud Abbas controls the crossing and international monitors are present. Egypt Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit said Hamas wants the border opened because it would represent Egyptian recognition of the group's control of Gaza. \\"Of course this is something we cannot do,\\" he said, \\"because it would undermine the legitimacy of the Palestinian Authority and consecrate the split between Gaza and the West Bank.\\" According to Sharif Elmusa, Associate Professor of Political Science at the American University in Cairo, Israel wants Gaza to fade into Egypt. Egyptian authorities are determined to avoid opening the Rafah crossing without ending the Israeli siege, which would ultimately serve Israel's goal of displacing the Gaza problem onto Egypt. Secondly it is Cairo's concern that under Hamas rule violence can spill into Sinai and threaten tourism, leaving Egypt vulnerable to US and Israeli accusations of ineffectively fighting terrorism.A new Palestine strategy for Egypt . Sharif S. Elmusa, Egypt Independent, 6 July 2010 Following the events of the Gaza flotilla raid in May 2010, after Egypt opened its borders with Gaza, it was reported that former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was caught between the need to appease growing public anger at Israel's actions and the necessity of maintaining his close relationship with Israel. This friendship was needed to secure more than $2bn of American aid annually, money on which many analysts believe Mubarak's former regime depended. While Israel contends that the blockade is necessary to prevent smuggling of weapons into Gaza, Egypt argues that it is needed to prevent smuggling of them from Gaza into the Sinai.In Gaza, sewage stains beaches and piles of garbage mount on streets . Reuters, 30 June 2014 In the 2014 Israel- Gaza conflict, Israel claimed that over 30 underground attack tunnels were discovered under the Israel-Gaza Border which are used by militants in order to infiltrate Israel. It also claimed that over 600,000 tons of cement required to construct the tunnels was originally designated for humanitarian aid and diverted. United States Although the United States officially supports the blockade,Israeli Raid Complicates U.S. Ties and Push for Peace by Helene Cooper and Ethan Bronner. The New York Times. Published (with correction) 31 May 2010. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton met Israeli Minister of Defence Ehud Barak in February 2010 and urged him to ease the blockade. The United States has long been pressing Israel to ease the restrictions on Gaza. Speaking about the Gaza flotilla raid, which occurred on 31 May 2010, Clinton stated that \\"The situation in Gaza is unsustainable and unacceptable.\\" In regards to the impending second Gaza flotilla, Clinton has stated that, \\"the Gaza flotilla is not necessary or useful.\\" In June 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the humanitarian needs in the Hamas- controlled area must be met along with legitimate Israeli security concerns. The United Nations On 24 January 2008, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a statement calling for Israel to lift its siege on the Gaza Strip, allow the continued supply of food, fuel, and medicine, and reopen border crossings. According to The Jerusalem Post, this was the 15th time in less than two years the council condemned Israel for its human rights record regarding the Palestinian territories. The proceedings were boycotted by Israel and the United States. Prior to this, U.N. Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, John Holmes, described the blockade as \\"collective punishment\\", saying, \\"We all understand the security problems and the need to respond to that but collective punishment of the people of Gaza is not, we believe, the appropriate way to do that.\\" On 15 December 2008, following a statement in which he described the embargo on Gaza as a crime against humanity, United Nations Special Rapporteur Richard A. Falk was prevented from entering the Palestinian territories by Israeli authorities and expelled from the region. The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Itzhak Levanon said that the mandate of the Special Rapporteur was \\"hopelessly unbalanced,\\" \\"redundant at best and malicious at worst.\\"Human Rights Council Elects Advisory Committee Members, United Nations press release, 26 March 2008. In August 2009, U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay criticised Israel for the blockade in a 34-page report, calling it a violation of the rules of war.(AP) ‚Äì GENEVA ‚Äì U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay has accused Israel of violating the rules of war with its blockade stopping people and goods from moving in and out of the Gaza Strip. In March 2010, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon stated that the blockade of Gaza is causing \\"unacceptable suffering\\" and that families were living in \\"unacceptable, unsustainable conditions\\". A UN Fact Finding mission in September 2009 led by South African Judge Richard Goldstone (the Goldstone report) concluded that the blockade was possibly a crime against humanity, and recommended that the matter be referred to the International Criminal Court if the situation has not improved in six months. In May 2010, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs stated that the formal economy in Gaza has collapsed since the imposition of the blockade. They also stated that the \\"restrictions imposed on the civilian population by the continuing blockade of the Gaza Strip amount to collective punishment, a violation of international humanitarian law.\\" In June 2010, United Nations envoy to the Middle East and former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair stated that \\"The policy of Gaza is counter-productive and what [Israel] should be doing is allow material in to rebuild homes and sanitation and power and water systems and allow business to flourish. Nor do we in fact do damage to the position of Hamas by harming people in Gaza. People are harmed when the quality of service is poor and people cannot work.\\" He also called for Hamas to stop the \\"terrorism coming out of Gaza\\". In the same month, Robert Serry, the UN special envoy for Middle East peace process, also said that \\"The flotilla crisis is the latest symptom of a failed policy. The situation in Gaza is unsustainable and the current policy is unacceptable and counter- productive, and requires a different, more positive strategy. The closure and blockade of the Gaza Strip needs to come to an end. There is now a welcome international consensus on Gaza.\\" In the September 2011 Palmer Report, the UN investigative committee for the 2010 Flotilla to Gaza said that Israel's naval blockade of Gaza was legal under international law, but criticised the nature of the Israeli raid. Later that same month, five independent U.N. rights experts reporting to the U.N. Human Rights Council rejected that conclusion, saying the blockade had subjected Palestinians in Gaza to collective punishment in \\"flagrant contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law.\\" European Union In May 2011, EU Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid Kristalina Georgieva said the European Union and the United Nations were \\"calling for the immediate, sustained and unconditional opening of crossings for the flow of humanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons.\\", after she and UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Valerie Amos had a meeting in Tel Aviv with Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak. She then said in an interview with Israel's Ynet that she believes that the \\"humanitarian crisis...was artificially created because of the blockade,\\" but added that the idea of a flotilla is not the correct action to take: \\"We are not in favor of attempts to help people in this way.\\" Turkey Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan made harsh comments against the blockade, especially following the Gaza flotilla raid. Erdoƒüan raised the possibility of trying to forcibly breach the blockade by sending the Turkish Navy to escort any future flotilla or by trying to visit Gaza himself. The Turkish government made it clear that it opposes the blockade and regards it as illegal, and before the flotilla raid, issued a demand for safe passage. However, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu said that Turkey was willing to normalize relations with Israel if it lifted the blockade. Following Israel's easing of the blockade, the Turkish Foreign Ministry called it \\"a positive but insufficient step\\", and said that \\"Turkey considers that Israel's inhuman blockade of Gaza represents a threat to regional peace and stability and considers that the blockade must be entirely lifted. Ireland After visiting Gaza in March 2010, Irish foreign minister Miche√°l Martin described the Israeli blockade of Palestinian-ruled Gaza as \\"inhumane and unacceptable\\" and called on the European Union and other countries to increase pressure on Israel to lift the blockade. Michael Martin was the first EU foreign minister to enter Gaza in over a year. He said that all that is being achieved through the blockade is to \\"enrich Hamas and marginalize even further the voices of moderation.\\" United Kingdom David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister, during Prime Minister's Questions, stated that \\"Friends of Israel ‚Äì and I count myself a friend of Israel ‚Äì should be saying to the Israelis that the blockade actually strengthens Hamas's grip on the economy and on Gaza, and it's in their own interests to lift it and allow these vital supplies to get through. ... We should do everything we can through the UN, where resolution 1860 is absolutely clear about the need to end the blockade and to open up Gaza.\\" In July 2010, Cameron called on Israel to relax the blockade. He said \\"Humanitarian goods and people must flow in both directions. Gaza cannot and must not be allowed to remain a prison camp.\\" In response, Ephraim Sneh, former Israeli minister, said: \\"Cameron is right ‚Äì Gaza is a prison camp, but those who control the prison are Hamas. I'm totally against the double standards of a nation which fights the Taliban but is showing its solidarity with their brothers, Hamas. Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom speaking after the Gaza flotilla raid, criticized the blockade saying \\"So the events of the last 24/48 hours confirm in my mind, as they do if you hear what William Hague and David Cameron have done and everyone in Government, the view that the blockade on Gaza is neither sustainable nor tenable in its present form.\\" He also commented that \\"If we needed any confirmation about the unjustified and untenable blockade of Gaza, we have been reminded overnight of the need to lift this blockade. What is going on in Gaza is a humanitarian catastrophe. While of course Israel has every right to defend itself and its citizens from attack, we must now move towards lifting the blockade from Gaza as soon as possible.\\" William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, said in a prepared speech to the House of Commons that the blockade of Gaza was \\"unacceptable and unsustainable\\", and that it was \\"the view of the British government, including the previous government, that restrictions on Gaza should be lifted ‚Äì a view confirmed in United Nations security council resolution 1860 which called for sustained delivery of humanitarian aid and which called on states to alleviate the humanitarian and economic situation\\", and that \\"current Israeli restrictions are counterproductive for Israel's long term security\\". Acting Labour Leader Harriet Harman also stated that \\"This blockade must end.\\" Humanitarian organizations Human Rights Watch argues that Israel is still an occupying power and is responsible for Gaza under the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which seeks to protect the civilian population. Amnesty International said that \\"The blockade constitutes collective punishment under international law and must be lifted immediately,\\" and that as the occupying power, Israel has a duty under international law to ensure the welfare of Gaza's inhabitants, including their rights to health, education, food and adequate housing.Amnesty International Israel's Gaza blockade continues to suffocate daily life 18 January 2010 On 7 March 2008, several international aid groups, including Amnesty International, CARE International UK, and Oxfam, issued a report saying that the humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip was more acute than at any time since the beginning of the Israeli occupation in 1967. While critical of Palestinian militants firing rockets from Gaza into Israel, and acknowledging that \\"Israel has the right and obligation to protect its citizens\\", they said that as the \\"occupying power in Gaza\\" it also has a legal duty to ensure Gaza civilians have access to food, clean water, electricity and medical care. They urged Israel to lift the blockade, characterizing it as collective punishment against the 1.5 million residents of the territory. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, \\"The hardship faced by Gaza's 1.5 million people cannot be addressed by providing humanitarian aid. The only sustainable solution is to lift the closure.\\" The ICRC has also referred to the blockade as \\"a collective punishment imposed in clear violation of Israel's obligations under international humanitarian law\\". In May 2015, the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor issued a report discussing the situation in Gaza 9 months after the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The report touched on the continuity of Gaza blockade was on the cost of relief, recovery and reconstruction due to last summer's war which reached $4 billion, as international donors pledged $3.5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction, only $954 million had been disbursed as of early April. The report also shed light on the UNRWA financial crises that threatened the stability of its operation in Gaza which probably further affect the humanitarian situation in Gaza Strip. The report accused the Egyptian authorities in joining Israel imposing Gaza siege. According to the report, Egypt had closed Rafah crossing 66% of the time in 2014, 100 days from the beginning of 2015 to May of the same year. As the world's attention has shifted away to other pressing issues, the report warned that, if the international community does not re-shoulder its responsibilities, Gaza will blow up into another war. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor urgently calls on the international community to take a practical steps to end the blockade on Gaza. The monitor also called the Egyptian government to open Rafah crossing, without any restrictions. Finally the monitor called for Support the Palestinian call for a commercial seaport in Gaza that guarantees the free import and export of goods and private international travel. Non- Governmental organizations Justus Weiner and Avi Bell of the pro-Israeli lobby group JCPA said that Israel's combat actions and blockade cannot be considered collective punishment. They cite Article 75(4)(b) of Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, which says the bar on collective punishment forbids the imposition of criminal-type penalties on individuals or groups on the basis of another's guilt, or the commission of acts that would otherwise violate the rules of distinction and/or proportionality. According to Weiner and Bell, the blockade does not \\"involve the imposition of criminal-type penalties or the violation of the rules of distinction and proportionality.\\"Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, International Law and the Fighting in Gaza, Justus Reid Weiner and Avi Bell, 2008, The Islamic Action Front (IAF), a Jordanian Islamist group, criticized Egypt for the blockade and accused it of \\"collaborating\\" with Israel and the United States. \\"The Egyptian authorities are ...increasing the suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza by building the steel wall and closing the border crossings with Gaza,\\" said Hamzah Mansour, a member of the Shura Council of the IAF.IAF slams Egypt's building of steel wall along borders with Gaza , 10 January 2010 Gideon Rose of the Council on Foreign Relations has written that the blockade serves a secondary aim, which is to undermine Hamas by making life unpleasant for Gaza's residents. Individuals * Jimmy Carter ‚Äì In June 2009, former President Jimmy Carter met with Hamas leaders in Gaza for three hours. Before his meeting with former Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh and other Hamas officials, President Carter spoke forcefully against the economic blockade of Gaza. \\"The responsibility for this terrible human rights crime lies in Jerusalem, Cairo, Washington, and throughout the international community. This abuse must cease; the crimes must be investigated; the walls must be brought down, and the basic right of freedom must come to you,\\" Carter tells the crowd at an awards ceremony for UN refugee school pupils. * Pope Benedict XVI ‚Äì Pope Benedict during his visit to Bethlehem in May 2009 specifically mentioned the plight of Gazans, saying: \\"Please be assured of my solidarity with you in the immense work of rebuilding which now lies ahead and my prayers that the embargo will soon be lifted.\\" * Jimmy Carter and Mary Robinson in August 2014 at the height of the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict called for a UN mandated lifting of the blockade.  International relief  Following the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict, a donors conference was held in Egypt where different countries committed to donate total sum of US$5.4 Billion. In September 2014, Turkey proposed sending a powership to Gaza to ease the shortage of electricity but in December 2014 Israel rejected the proposal stating that the infrastructure in Gaza was not compatible with the ship.

He throws three pitches: a fastball, a slider, and a changeup. Ram√≠rez was signed by the San Diego Padres in 2000 as an outfielder, but he was released in 2001. The Reds signed him in 2003 as a pitcher, and he reached the major leagues in 2008, when he made four starts for the Reds. The next year, he appeared in 11 games in relief for the Reds. After the season, the Tampa Bay Rays claimed him off waivers, but they released him. The Boston Red Sox claimed him off waivers, and he spent 2010 in the minor leagues for them. He signed with the Doosan Bears of the Korea Baseball Organization in 2011, but he was released before appearing in a game with them. Professional career San Diego Padres On March 27, 2000, Ram√≠rez was signed by the San Diego Padres as an outfielder. He was released by the Padres on June 12, 2001. Cincinnati Reds =2004‚Äì2007= On May 12, 2003, Ram√≠rez was signed by the Cincinnati Reds, this time as a pitcher. In 2004, he pitched for the Billings Mustangs of the Pioneer League, a rookie league. In 17 games (12 starts), he had three wins and six losses, which was tied for fourth in the league. However, he was 10th in the league in strikeouts (60), third in innings pitched (), and second in earned run average (3.39, behind only Samuel Deduno's 3.18 ERA). In 2005, Ram√≠rez pitched for the Dayton Dragons of the single-A Midwest League. He had a 5‚Äì7 record, a 4.50 ERA, 114 innings pitched, and 90 strikeouts in 30 games (19 starts). Ram√≠rez pitched for the Sarasota Reds of the single-A advanced Florida State League in 2006. He had a 4‚Äì5 record, a 4.29 ERA, 53 strikeouts, 65 innings pitched, and one complete game in 15 games (11 starts). In 2007, Ram√≠rez began the year with Sarasota again. He had a 5‚Äì2 record, a 4.05 ERA, innings pitched, and 86 strikeouts in 15 games (12 starts); and he was promoted to the Chattanooga Lookouts of the double-A Southern League on June 22. At Chattanooga, used exclusively as a relief pitcher, he had a 5‚Äì1 record, a 4.60 ERA, innings pitched, and 35 strikeouts in 16 games. On August 18, he was promoted to the Louisville Bats of the triple-A International League to replace Elizardo Ram√≠rez, who was called up to the Reds. With Louisville, Ram√≥n Ram√≠rez had a 1‚Äì0 record, an 0.00 ERA, innings pitched, and 16 strikeouts in five games (two starts). In the minor leagues that year, he had 11 wins (tied for fourth in the Reds' system), 3 losses, a 3.70 ERA (ninth), innings pitched, and 137 strikeouts (second) in 36 games (14 starts). The Cincinnati Reds added him to their 40-man roster on November 20. =2008= Ram√≠rez attended Reds' spring training in but was optioned to the minors on March 10 after having an 11.57 ERA in three games. He began the season with Chattanooga. After he had a 2‚Äì3 record, a 4.70 ERA, 46 innings pitched, and 52 strikeouts in 11 games (nine starts), he was promoted to Louisville on May 23. At Louisville, he had a 4‚Äì5 record, a 3.08 ERA, innings pitched, and 93 strikeouts in 19 games (15 starts). On August 30, he was called up to the Reds make a start that day in place of the injured Johnny Cueto. He gave up three runs over seven innings while striking out six, but he received a no decision in a 7‚Äì6 victory over the San Francisco Giants. He was optioned to Sarasota the next day to make room for Wilkin Castillo on the roster but was recalled on September 2. On September 4, he threw three perfect innings in relief of an injured Josh Fogg in an 8‚Äì6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Afterwards, he made three more starts for the Reds. He got his first career decision (a win) on September 19 when he gave up two runs and struck out five batters in six innings as the Reds defeated the Milwaukee Brewers, 11‚Äì2. He got his only other decision of the year on September 24, when he gave up two runs in five innings in a 5‚Äì0 loss to the Houston Astros. Ram√≠rez finished the year 1‚Äì1, with a 2.67 ERA, 21 strikeouts, and 27 innings pitched in 5 games (4 starts). In the minors, he had a 6‚Äì8 record, a 3.59 ERA, 145 strikeouts, and innings pitched in 30 games (24 starts). =2009= Ram√≠rez was expected to compete for a spot in the Reds' starting rotation in ; however, because he missed much of spring training at the World Baseball Classic, he began the year with Louisville. On May 19, he was called up from Louisville to replace the injured Nick Masset in the bullpen. After appearing in one game, he was optioned back to Louisville on May 22 to make room for Carlos Fisher on the roster. He remained in Louisville until August 31, when he was recalled between games of a doubleheader. After giving up 4 runs in his first 3 games of the season, Ram√≠rez gave up 1 run in his last 8 games. Used exclusively out of the bullpen, he finished the year with an 0‚Äì0 record, a 3.65 ERA, eight strikeouts, and innings pitched in 11 games.

On November 6, he became a free agent. Doosan Bears In 2011, Ram√≠rez signed with the Doosan Bears of the Korea Baseball Organization. However, he was released before playing a regular season game after he struggled in the preseason. International play In 2009, Ram√≠rez represented Venezuela in the World Baseball Classic, deciding to play in the tournament at the last minute. On March 10, he gave up one run in three innings of relief as Venezuela defeated Italy 10‚Äì1 to advance to the second round of the Classic. He pitched a scoreless of an inning on March 16 as Venezuela defeated Puerto Rico 2‚Äì0. In his final game of the Classic (on March 18), Ram√≠rez gave up two runs in innings, but Venezuela defeated the United States 10‚Äì6 to advance to the semifinals.

The group is part of the Hebrew Israelism movement, which regards American blacks as descendants of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. The Southern Poverty Law Center has designated the ISUPK a hate group, citing its \\"extremist\\" ideology and black supremacist rhetoric.

The ISUPK's volume and the volume of other groups prompted Washington's municipal government to consider passing an ordinance in order to \\"resolve the issue.\\" The measure would have limited the volume of daytime noncommercial speech to 70 decibels, but it died because of free-speech concerns. ISUPK's regional director, General Yahanna, defended the group, saying that residents' real issue was not sound, but the content of the group's message. The group identifies its message as saving local residents' souls and discouraging people from drugs and crime; it regards its separatist teachings as the real objection which residents have.

This is the case for many sets of paralogous genes. When an individual gene in such a set is disrupted by mutation or targeted knockout, there can be little effect on phenotype as a result of gene redundancy, whereas the effect is large for the knockout of a gene with only one copy.Figure 1. Common mechanisms of gene duplication.  Origin and Evolution of Redundant Genes  Gene redundancy most often results from Gene duplication. When a gene is duplicated within a genome, the two copies are initially functionally redundant. Three of the more common mechanisms of gene duplication are retroposition, unequal crossing over, and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During unequal crossing over, homologous chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This can lead to the transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms. Figure 2. After a duplication event, redundant genes undergo either subfunctionalization, neofunctionalization, or gene lossAs the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to Genetic drift. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function. The three mechanisms of functional differentiation in genes are nonfunctionalization (or gene loss), neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization. During nonfunctionalization, or degeneration/gene loss, one copy of the duplicated gene acquires mutations that render it inactive or silent. At this time, the gene has no function and is called a pseudogene. Pseudogenes can be lost over time due to genetic mutations. Neofunctionalization occurs when one copy of the gene accumulates mutations that give the gene a new, beneficial function that is different than the original function. Subfunctionalization occurs when both copies of the redundant gene acquire mutations. Each copy becomes only partially active; two of these partial copies then act as one normal copy of the original gene. Figure 2 to the right provides a visual explanation.  Gene Maintenance Hypotheses  The evolution and origin of redundant genes remain unknown, largely because evolution happens over such a long period of time. Theoretically, a gene can not be maintained without mutation unless it has a selective pressure acting on it. Gene redundancy, therefore, would allow both copies of the gene to accumulate mutations as long as the other was still able to perform its function. This means that all redundant genes should theoretically become a pseudogene and eventually be lost. Scientists have devised two hypothesis as to why redundant genes can remain in the genome: the backup hypothesis and the piggyback hypothesis. The backup hypothesis proposes that redundant genes remain in the genome as a sort of \\"back-up plan\\". If the original gene loses its function, the redundant gene is there to take over and keep the cell alive. The piggyback hypothesis states that two paralogs in the genome have some kind of non-overlapping function as well as the redundant function. In this case, the redundant part of the gene remains in the genome due to the proximity to the area that codes for the unique function. The reason redundant genes remain in the genome is an ongoing question and gene redundancy is being studied by researchers everywhere. There are many hypotheses in addition to the backup and piggyback models. For example, at the University of Michigan, a study provides the theory that redundant genes are maintained in the genome by reduced expression.  Research   Gene Families and Phylogeny  Researchers often use the history of redundant genes in the form of gene families to learn about the phylogeny of a species. It takes time for redundant genes to undergo functional diversification; the degree of diversification between orthologs tells us how closely related the two genomes are. Gene duplication events can also be detected by looking at increases in gene duplicates. A good example of using gene redundancy in evolutionary studies is the Evolution of the KCS gene family in plants. This paper studies how one KCS gene evolved into an entire gene family via duplication events. The number of redundant genes in the species allows researchers to determine when duplication events took place and how closely related species are.  Locating and Characterizing Redundant Genes  Currently, there are three ways to detect paralogs in a known genomic sequence: simple homology (FASTA), gene family evolution (TreeFam) and orthology (eggNOG v3). Since the Human Genome Project's completion, researchers are able to annotate the human genome much more easily. Using online databases like the Genome Browser at UCSC, researchers can look for homology in the sequence of their gene of interest.  Human Redundant Genes   Olfactory Receptors  The Human Olfactory Receptor (OR) gene family contains 339 intact genes and 297 pseudogenes. These genes are found in different locations throughout the genome, but only about 13% are on different chromosomes or on distantly spaced loci. 172 subfamilies of OR genes have been found in humans, each at its own loci. Because the genes in each of these subfamilies are structurally and functionally similar, and in close proximity to each other, it is hypothesized that each evolved from single genes undergoing duplication events. The high number of subfamilies in humans explains why we are able to recognize so many odors. Human OR genes have homologues in other mammals, such as mice, that demonstrate the evolution of Olfactory Receptor genes. One particular family that is involved in the initial event of odor perception has been found to be highly conserved throughout all of vertebrate evolution.  Disease  Duplication events and redundant genes have often been thought to have a role in some human diseases. Large scale whole genome duplication events that occurred early in vertebrate evolution may be the reason that human monogenic disease genes often contain a high number of redundant genes. Chen et al. hypothesizes that the functionally redundant paralogs in human monogenic disease genes mask the effects of dominant deleterious mutations, thereby maintaining the disease gene in the human genome. Whole genome duplications may be a leading cause of retention of some tumor causing genes in the human genome. For example, Strout et al. have shown that tandem duplication events, likely via homologous recombination, are linked to acute myeloid leukemia. The partial duplication of the ALL1 (MLL) gene is a genetic defect has been found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.

It was located about 21 kilometres south-west of Provins and 15 kilometres east of Montereau-Fault-Yonne. The abbey ruins  History  Preuilly Abbey, the fifth daughter house of C√Æteaux Abbey, was founded in 1118 by Stephen Harding on a site provided by Theobald of Blois, Count of Champagne. The first abbot was Arthaud. The abbey soon became prosperous and founded its own daughter houses, Vauluisant Abbey (1129) and Barbeau Abbey (1148). In 1146 La Colombe Abbey, founded some years previously, joined the Cistercian Order and put itself under the supervision of Preuilly. In the 14th and 15th centuries the monastery was sacked and laid waste several times, and occupied by English troops. In 1536 it passed into the hands of commendatory abbots. It was plundered again in 1567 during the Wars of Religion and in 1652 during the Fronde. The buildings were restored at the beginning of the 18th century. After the dissolution of the abbey in 1791 during the French Revolution the church was used as a saltpetre factory, and the other buildings were sold off at auction to different owners. Considerable demolition took place, which was brought to an end only in the years between 1829 and 1846, when a Dr. Husson bought up the site in small portions. The surviving buildings have been protected since 1927 as a Monument historique.  Buildings and precinct  The church, which dates from the second third of the 12th century and had a choir with a rose window and a transept with another rose window in the south front, is in ruins, as is the chapter house. The passage from the cloister to the church survives, as do the armarium, the sacristy, the entrance portal to the monastery between two round towers, and a part of the abbot's house.

Whitesell (born April 14, 1982, in Durham, North Carolina) is an American former professional baseball first baseman who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Tokyo Yakult Swallows and Chiba Lotte Marines. In the minor leagues, Whitesell was a Carolina League mid-season All Star in 2005, and an Eastern League mid-season All-Star team in 2007. In 2008, Whitesell was voted the Diamondbacks' 2008 Minor League Player of the Year, a Baseball America Triple-A All Star, and the Pacific Coast League Rookie of the Year. Baseball America also ranked him the best power hitter in the organization, and as having the best strike zone discipline in the organization. Whitesell played for the Arizona Diamondbacks in Major League Baseball for parts of 2008 and 2009. He played in the Washington Nationals organization for part of 2010, and played in the Japanese League for four years from 2010‚Äì13. Heritage and early life Whitesell is Jewish. He attended Rialto High School in Rialto, California, and pitched and played first base for the school's Rialto Knights, with teammate Ricky Nolasco who now pitches for the Los Angeles Angels. He was chosen to the first team All-Citrus Belt League and All-San Bernardino County in his sophomore and junior years. In his senior year he had an 8‚Äì2 record, 1.74 ERA, and a .520 batting average. He was named 1st-team All-CIF Division I and 1st-team All-Citrus Belt League, and to the San Bernardino County North and CBCA (California Baseball Coaches' Association) Southern California All- Star teams. He played for US Team in the Goodwill Games against Japan, and was named by the San Bernardino Sun as San Bernardino County Player of the Year.

Minor leagues Whitesell was drafted out of college in the 6th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft by the Montreal Expos. Whitesell was voted a Carolina League mid-season All Star while playing for the Potomac Nationals in 2005, for whom he batted .293/.416/.524, and was voted the Eastern League player-of-the-week on July 23, 2006. =2007= In , Whitesell played for the Harrisburg Senators, the Double-A affiliate of the Washington Nationals. He hit .284/.425/.512 with 78 runs, 23 doubles, 21 homers, and 74 RBIs in 119 games. He was named to the Eastern League mid-season All-Star team, and the Nationals signed him to a contract. =2008= On March 15, , Whitesell was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks, and assigned to Triple-A Tucson. Whitesell had hitting streaks of 16 games (July 23 ‚Äì August 9) and 19 games (June 27 ‚Äì July 18) in his 2008 season with Tucson. He had a season-high 7 RBIs on May 23 vs. Sacramento.

Baseball America also ranked him the best power hitter in the organization, and as having the best strike zone discipline in the organization. =2009= Playing for the Reno Aces in 2009, through May 5 (when he was brought up to the Diamondbacks), Whitesell was 2nd in the Pacific Coast League in on-base percentage (.477) and walks (20), 5th in batting average (.356) and hits (31), 6th in OPS (1.028), 8th in RBIs (20), and hitting for a .552 slugging percentage. Through 2009, Whitesell had hit 113 home runs with a .394 on-base percentage and a .492 slugging percentage in seven minor-league seasons. =2010= Whitesell played part of the 2010 season with the Nationals' AAA team, the Syracuse Chiefs, batting .304/.406/.446 in 184 at- bats, before signing with Tokyo Yakult Swallows. Major leagues =Arizona Diamondbacks (2008‚Äì09)= ;2008 Whitesell made his major league debut on September 2, . He collected his first major league hit, a single, against the San Francisco Giants on September 15, during his first start. Whitesell hit his first home run on September 21, against Colorado Rockies pitcher Steven Register. ;2009 In December 2008, Whitesell appeared to be one of the top two candidates for the spot of top left-handed pinch hitter off the bench and reserve first baseman for the 2009 season. In January 2009 FanGraphs writer Marc Hulet took the Diamondbacks to task for bringing back \\"aging pinch hitter Tony Clark\\", despite his 2008 line of .225/.359/.318, saying \\"it's quite possible that Clark will continue to struggle in 2009. His line against right-handed pitchers was just .198/.354/.248, which makes him almost useless against them if this was not simply a one-year fluke.\\" He added, referring to Whitesell, \\"What makes matters worse is that the organization has some in- house talent that could possibly provide the same production ‚Äì if not more ‚Äì for half the salary.... Whitesell ... has more upside and creamed right-handed pitchers in 2008 at Triple-A to the tune of .342/.442/.602 in 342 at-bats. Whitesell ... did well in 2008 with runners in scoring position by hitting .331/.438/.586. Truth be told, there are not many ‚Äì if any ‚Äì unimpressive numbers in Whitesell's statistics from 2008. He deserves a shot, and Arizona could certainly benefit from replacing Clark with the youngster and allowing Whitesell to get his feet wet as a pinch hitter while also playing regularly at first base against right-handed pitching.\\" In February 2009, Diamondback President and CEO Derrick Hall, when asked whether Whitesell would be given a shot to make the major league team out of spring training, responded: \\"He sure will. He has so much raw power, it is fun watching him hit. He is a talented kid who catches a lot of coaches' and scouts' eyes.\\" In late March, Manager Bob Melvin's assessment of him was: \\"The offense is legitimate.\\" In spring training, Whitesell led the team in on-base percentage (.429; best of all hitters with 30 or more at bats), tied for the team lead in home runs (3) and walks (11; despite receiving only the 11th-most at bats on the team), was second in runs (12), and tied for second in RBIs (12), while batting .308 with a .519 slugging percentage. During the last weekend before the season began, however, he was told that he had not made the team's opening day roster. \\"He had a great camp\\" said Melvin. \\"He's certainly a guy we wouldn't hesitate to (call up) if we did have an injury or something along those lines.\\" On May 6, Whitesell was called back up to the Diamondbacks, after hitting .356 for the Reno Aces with a .477 on-base percentage (2nd in the PCL) and a .552 slugging percentage. He took the place of Tony Clark, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Melvin said Whitesell would get a chance to play every day. On May 19, however, not even two weeks later, Melvin had been fired as manager and the team optioned Whitesell back to Reno. On May 30, Whitesell was back with the team, and new Manager A. J. Hinch said Whitesell would start the following day and will get a \\"good, long look\\" the next couple of weeks at first base. Hinch said: \\"Really the only thing [Whitesell] hasn't conquered is the major-league side of it, because every time he goes down to Triple-A he performs very well\\". Despite batting .300 with a .447 on-base percentage in his second stint with the team, Whitesell was optioned back to Reno on June 19 when Tony Clark came off the disabled list and returned to Arizona (after a rehab assignment at Reno in which he batted .160, and during which he turned 37). Clark was finally released in mid-July, and Whitesell was called back up for the third time in the season to replace him on July 16. Asked what he had been told by Diamondbacks management, Whitesell responded: \\"I just know that ... the first base job for 2010 is up for the taking, so I'm going to get a fair opportunity.\\" He added that his game plan was to try to \\"relax and let the game come to me, as opposed to trying to do too much, and let your mind take you six different ways at once ‚Äî where you just relax, and know it's the same game you've been playing the whole time, the game will come to you, and success will come.\\"Bagnato, Andrew, \\"Diamondbacks looking for answers in second half,\\" Charleston Daily Mail, July 16, 2009, accessed July 16, 2009 Hinch said he expected Whitesell to be more comfortable at the plate now that he had had some experience at the Major League level, recalling that the first time Whitesell was up: \\"I'd joke with him about squeezing the sawdust out of the bat every time he got up to bat, he was so intense on making a difference. The second time [he was called up] he was a lot more relaxed.\\" Hinch added, \\"We're excited to have Whitesell, obviously. He's done everything that he's needed to do in Triple-A. He's contributed a little bit when he got the opportunity here in the big leagues.\\"Gintonio, Jim, \\"Whitesell recalled; Tracy wondering,\\" The Arizona Republic, July 16, 2009, accessed July 16, 2009 Hinch spoke with Whitesell and Chad Tracy on July 17 and told them that Whitesell would get the bulk of the action at first base, starting four or five times a week \\"for the time being\\". He did not get the bulk of the playing time at first base, however, and was sent back to Reno in late August. The Diamondbacks declined to tender Whitesell a contract on December 13, 2009, making him a free agent. =Washington Nationals (2010)= On December 28, 2009, Whitesell signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. He also received an invitation to spring training. The signing represented a return to his original organization: Whitesell was drafted in the sixth round of the 2003 draft by the Montreal Expos, who would later become the Nationals. He played part of the 2010 season with the Nationals' \\"AAA\\" squad, the Syracuse Chiefs. =Japanese League (2010‚Äì13)= Whitesell, with the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, at Yokohama Stadium, in 2010 On June 7, 2010, Whitesell was acquired from Washington by the Tokyo Yakult Swallows, and signed for 30 million yen (roughly $327,000) for the remainder of the season. His early results were impressive. Through Aug. 22, 2010, he was batting .324 with 10 HRs and 34 RBIs in just 136 atbats. In addition, Whitesell was leading the Swallows in on-base percentage (.436), slugging percentage (.647), and on-base plus slugging (1.083). His rate of one HR per 13.6 at-bats was the club's best. And despite having no experience with the larger Japanese strike zone, few teammates were walking more often than Whitesell. He batted .309 for the season, with 15 home runs and a .399 on-base percentage and a .591 slugging percentage. He played for the Swallows in 2011 as well, under a contract paying him 90 million yen plus incentives. On December 28, 2011, Whitesell signed with the Chiba Lotte Marines. In 2012 for the team, he batted .309 again. In the winter of 2013, he played with the Estrellas de Oriente in the Dominican Winter League. Mexican League =Saraperos de Saltillo (2014)= In 2014, he played for Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League.

Suspicion can also be aroused in response to objects that negatively differ from an expected idea. In the US, the courts use the term \\"reasonable suspicion\\" in connection with the right of the police to stop people on the street. The word comes from Middle-English via the Old French word \\"suspicion\\", which is a variation of the Italian word \\"sospetto\\" (a derivative of the Latin term \\"suspectio\\", which means \\"to watch\\"). History English philosopher, statesman, and author Francis Bacon (1561‚Äì1626) wrote an essay entitled Of Suspicion, in which he stated that suspicions need to be repressed and well-guarded, because otherwise they will cloud the mind, and cause a ruler to move towards tyranny, due to the fear that his subjects are conspiring against him, and a husband to become jealous and fearful of his wife's interactions with other men. Bacon argued that the root of suspicion was a lack of knowledge; as such, the remedy to suspicion was to learn more about the issue that is troubling you. If a husband is concerned about his wife's male friends, he should ask her about the nature of these friendships and state his concerns, rather than building up his suspicions. Bacon urged people who were harboring suspicions, to be frank with the people that they were suspecting, and clear the matter up.http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/mike_donnelly/lotSEVEN.htm The British dramatist William Shakespeare noted that \\"Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind\\". English Renaissance dramatist, poet, and actor Ben Jonson (1572‚Äì1637), a contemporary of Shakespeare, described suspicion as a \\"black poison\\" that \\"infects the human mind like a plague\\". Samuel Johnson (1709‚Äì1784), an English author and essayist, called suspicion a \\"useless pain\\" in which a person has a belief that a formidable evil lies within all of their fellow men. The Scottish poet and a lyricist Robert Burns (1759‚Äì1796) called suspicion a \\"heavy armor\\" that impedes humans more than it protects them. Mahatma Gandhi, the political and spiritual leader of the non-violent Indian independence movement, warned that if suspicions arise about any of a person's motives, then all of their acts can become tainted with this mistrust and uncertainty. In Islam the remedy to cure suspicion is given as Al-Hasan bin 'Ali said: \\"I remember that the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w) said: 'Leave what makes you in doubt for what does not make you in doubt. The truth brings tranquility while falsehood sows doubt.'

It is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia (happiness, or blessedness) is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or by the fear of pain, by using one's mind to understand the world and to do one's part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly. The Stoics are especially known for teaching that \\"virtue is the only good\\" for human beings, and that external things‚Äîsuch as health, wealth, and pleasure‚Äîare not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora), but have value as \\"material for virtue to act upon.\\" Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics.Sharpe, Matthew. \\"Stoic Virtue Ethics.\\" Handbook of Virtue Ethics, 2013, 28‚Äì41. The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is \\"in accordance with nature.\\" Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.John Sellars. Stoicism, 2006, p. 32. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature. Many Stoics‚Äîsuch as Seneca and Epictetus‚Äîemphasized that because \\"virtue is sufficient for happiness,\\" a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase \\"stoic calm,\\" though the phrase does not include the \\"radical ethical\\" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.Stoicism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism). Name Origins Stoicism was originally known as \\"Zenonism\\", after the founder Zeno of Citium. However, this name was soon dropped, likely because the Stoics did not consider their founders to be perfectly wise, and to avoid the risk of the philosophy becoming a cult of personality. The name \\"Stoicism\\" derives from the Stoa Poikile (Ancient Greek: ·º° œÄŒøŒπŒ∫ŒØŒªŒ∑ œÉœÑŒøŒ¨), or \\"painted porch\\", a colonnade decorated with mythic and historical battle scenes, on the north side of the Agora in Athens, where Zeno and his followers gathered to discuss their ideas. Sometimes Stoicism is therefore referred to as \\"The Stoa\\", or the philosophy of \\"The Porch\\". Modern usage The word \\"stoic\\" commonly refers to someone who is indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy. The modern usage as a \\"person who represses feelings or endures patiently\\" was first cited in 1579 as a noun and in 1596 as an adjective. In contrast to the term \\"Epicurean\\", the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on Stoicism notes, \\"the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins.\\" Basic tenets The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, constructed from ideals of logic, monistic physics and naturalistic ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers. Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive emotions; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (logos). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: \\"Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature.\\"Russell, Bertrand. A History of Western Philosophy, p. 254 This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; \\"to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,\\"Russell, Bertrand. A History of Western Philosophy, p. 264 and to accept even slaves as \\"equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature\\".Russell, Bertrand. A History of Western Philosophy, p. 253. The Stoic ethic espouses a deterministic perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, Cleanthes once opined that the wicked man is \\"like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes\\". A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, \\"sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,\\" thus positing a \\"completely autonomous\\" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is \\"a rigidly deterministic single whole\\". This viewpoint was later described as \\"Classical Pantheism\\" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza).Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, \\"Philosophers Speak of God,\\" Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4 History DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:250 PlotArea = left:15 right:10 bottom:20 top:0 Colors = id:bleuclair value:rgb(0.56,0.56,0.86) id:rouge value:red id:rougeclair value:rgb(0.86,0.56,0.56) id:bleu value:rgb(0.76,0.76,0.96) id:grilleMinor value:rgb(0.86,0.86,0.86) id:grilleMajor value:rgb(0.56,0.56,0.56) id:protohistoire value:rgb(1,0.7,0.7) id:noir value:black id:canvas value:rgb(0.97,0.97,0.97) id:Holo value:rgb(0.4,0.8,0.7) id:PSup value:rgb(0.5,1,0.5) id:PMoy value:rgb(0.6,1,0.6) id:PInf value:rgb(0.7,1,0.7) # vert clair id:Plio value:rgb(0.8,1,0.8) # vert pÔøΩle id:gris value:gray(0.80) id:grilleMajor value:rgb(0.80,0.80,0.80) id:Timeperiod value:red id:Timeperiod2 value:rgb(0.86,0.56,0.56) Period = from:-400 till:300 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy AlignBars = justify ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:50 start:-400 gridcolor:grilleMinor ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:50 start:-400 gridcolor:grilleMajor BackgroundColors = canvas:canvas bars:canvas BarData= bar:Timeperiod barset:auteurs Define $marquerouge = text:\\"*\\" textcolor:rouge shift:(0,-3) fontsize:10 PlotData= width:15 fontsize:M textcolor:noir align:center # √âpoques bar:Timeperiod color:Timeperiod shift:(0,-3) from:start till:end color:gris # Arri√®re plan from:-400 till:300 text: \\"The Stoics\\" color:Timeperiod2 # auteurs width:6 align:left fontsize:M shift:(5,-5) anchor:till barset:auteurs from:-335 till:-264 text:\\"Zeno of Citium\\" color:Pinf from:-330 till:-232 text:\\"Cleanthes\\" color:Pinf from:-281 till:-205 text:\\"Chrysippus\\" color:Pinf from:-240 till:-152 text:\\"Diogenes of Babylon\\" color:Pinf from:-210 till:-129 text:\\"Antipater of Tarsus\\" color:Pinf from:-180 till:-100 text:\\"Panaetius\\" color:Pinf from:-140 till:-51 text:\\"Posidonius\\" color:Pinf from:-4 till:65 text:\\"Seneca\\" color:Pinf from:25 till:95 text:\\"Musonius Rufus\\" color:Pinf from:55 till:135 text:\\"Epictetus\\" color:Pinf from:121 till:180 text:\\"Marcus Aurelius\\" color:Pinf Antisthenes, founder of the Cynic school of philosophy Beginning around 301 BC, Zeno taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile (\\"Painted Porch\\"), from which his philosophy got its name. Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the Epicureans, Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a colonnade overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the Agora. Zeno's ideas developed from those of the Cynics, whose founding father, Antisthenes, had been a disciple of Socrates. Zeno's most influential follower was Chrysippus, who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control. Bust of Seneca Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases: * Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to Antipater. * Middle Stoa, including Panaetius and Posidonius. * Late Stoa, including Musonius Rufus, Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. No complete works survive from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.A.A.Long, Hellenistic Philosophy, p. 115. Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire, to the point where, in the words of Gilbert Murray \\"nearly all the successors of Alexander [...] professed themselves Stoics.\\"Gilbert Murray, The Stoic Philosophy (1915), p. 25. In Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (1946). Logic Propositional logic Diodorus Cronus, who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as propositional logic, which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's term logic. Later, Chrysippus developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see Syllogism). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. Susanne Bobzien wrote, \\"The many close similarities between Chrysippus's philosophical logic and that of Gottlob Frege are especially striking.\\"Ancient Logic by Susanne Bobzien. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Bobzien also notes that \\"Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including speech act theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of predicates, indexicals, existential propositions, sentential connectives, negations, disjunctions, conditionals, logical consequence, valid argument forms, theory of deduction, propositional logic, modal logic, tense logic, epistemic logic, logic of suppositions, logic of imperatives, ambiguity and logical paradoxes.\\" Categories The Stoics held that all beings (·ΩÑŒΩœÑŒ±)‚Äîthough not all things (œÑŒπŒΩŒ¨)‚Äîare material.Jacques Brunschwig, Stoic Metaphysics in The Cambridge Companion to Stoics, ed. B. Inwood, Cambridge, 2006, p.206-32 Besides the existing beings they admitted four incorporeals (asomata): time, place, void, and sayable.Sextus Empiricus, Adversus Mathematicos 10.218. (chronos, topos, kenon, lekton) They were held to be just 'subsisting' while such a status was denied to universals.Marcelo D. Boeri, The Stoics on Bodies and Incorporeals, The Review of Metaphysics, Vol. 54, No. 4 (Jun., 2001), pp. 723-752 Thus, they accepted Anaxagoras's idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all accidents. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object. They held that there were four categories. * substance (·ΩëœÄŒøŒ∫ŒµŒØŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒΩ) ::The primary matter, formless substance, (ousia) that things are made of * quality (œÄŒøŒπœåŒΩ) ::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (pneuma: air or breath), which informs the matter *somehow disposed (œÄœâœÇ ·ºîœáŒøŒΩ) ::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture *Somehow disposed in relation to something (œÄœÅœåœÇ œÑŒØ œÄœâœÇ ·ºîœáŒøŒΩ) ::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects Stoics outlined what we have control over categories of our own action, thoughts and reaction. The opening paragraph of The Enchiridion states the categories as: \\"Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in a word, whatever are not our own actions.\\" These suggest a space that is within our own control. Epistemology The Stoics propounded that knowledge can be attained through the use of reason. Truth can be distinguished from fallacy‚Äîeven if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the senses constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the mind, where they leave an impression in the imagination (phantasiai) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma). VII.49 The mind has the ability to judge (œÉœÖŒ≥Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ¨Œ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ, synkatathesis)‚Äîapprove or reject‚Äîan impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled belief or opinion (doxa). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (katalepsis). Certain and true knowledge (episteme), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind. Physics According to the Stoics, the Universe is a material reasoning substance (logos), known as God or Nature, which was divided into two classes: the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which \\"lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion\\".Seneca, Epistles, lxv. 2. The active substance, which can be called Fate or Universal Reason (logos), is an intelligent aether or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter: Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The souls of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate: Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be \\"transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the seminal reason (\\"logos spermatikos\\") of the Universe\\".Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, iv. 21. Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to Nature. Stoic theology is a fatalistic and naturalistic pantheism: God is never fully transcendent but always immanent, and identified with Nature. Abrahamic religions personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic cosmology, which is very similar to the Hindu conception of existence, there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the space and Universe have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed (\\"ekpyr≈çsis\\", conflagration) and re-created again,Michael Lapidge, Stoic Cosmology, in: John M. Rist, The Stoics, Cambridge University Press, 1978, pp. 182‚Äì183. and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all existence as cyclical, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also Eternal return). Stoicism, just like Indian religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe. According to the Stoics, the logos was the active reason or anima mundi pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the seminal reason (\\"logos spermatikos\\"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate matter. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine logos, which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.Tripolitis, A., Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age, pp. 37‚Äì38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. The first philosophers to explicitly describe nominalist arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.John Sellars, Stoicism, Routledge, 2014, pp. 84‚Äì85: \\"[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial Platonic Forms or in some other manner.\\".Chrysippus ‚Äì Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy Ethics Ancient stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts than today. The word \\"stoic\\" has since come to mean \\"unemotional\\" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from \\"passion\\" by following \\"reason\\". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute \\"askƒìsis\\", that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm. Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline, temperance is split into self-control, discipline and modesty. Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: \\"Follow where reason leads.\\" One must therefore strive to be free of the passions, bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of \\"passion\\" was \\"anguish\\" or \\"suffering\\", that is, \\"passively\\" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between pathos (plural pathe) which is normally translated as passion, propathos or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and eupathos, which is the mark of the Stoic sage (sophos). The eupatheia are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment. The idea was to be free of suffering through apatheia (Greek: ; literally, \\"without passion\\") or peace of mind, where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense‚Äîbeing objective or having \\"clear judgment\\" and the maintenance of equanimity in the face of life's highs and lows. For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature‚Äîthe logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people. The four cardinal virtues (aretai) of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of Plato (Republic IV. 426‚Äì435): * Wisdom (Greek: œÜœÅœåŒΩŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ \\"phronesis\\" or œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ± \\"sophia\\", Latin: prudentia or sapientia) * Courage (Greek: Œ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµŒØŒ± \\"andreia\\", Latin: fortitudo) * Justice (Greek: Œ¥ŒπŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ \\"dikaiosyne\\", Latin: iustitia) * Temperance (Greek: œÉœâœÜœÅŒøœÉœçŒΩŒ∑ \\"sophrosyne\\", Latin: temperantia) Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and evil are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature. The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.Don E. Marietta, (1998), Introduction to ancient philosophy, pp. 153‚Äì54. Sharpe Plutarch held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised Cato's self-consistency (constantia) as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices. Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease, but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.William Braxton Irvine, (2009), A guide to the good life: the ancient art of Stoic joy, p. 200. Oxford University Press The doctrine of \\"things indifferent\\" In philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of moral law‚Äîthat is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect morality, are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent (, adiaphora) arose in the Stoic school as a corollary of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ( kathekonta, \\"convenient actions\\", or actions in accordance with nature; and ·ºÅŒºŒ±œÅœÑŒÆŒºŒ±œÑŒ± hamartemata, mistakes). As a result of this dichotomy, a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent. Eventually three sub-classes of \\"things indifferent\\" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of adiaphora was also common to the Cynics. Philipp Melanchthon revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the Renaissance. Spiritual exercise Marcus Aurelius, the Stoic Roman emperor Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims; it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or \\"askƒìsis\\"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included logic, Socratic dialogue and self-dialogue, contemplation of death, mortality salience, training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to mindfulness and some forms of Buddhist meditation), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions e.g. with journaling. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder. In his Meditations, Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I: > Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, > violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of > real good and ill...I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will > involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we > have come into the world to work together... Prior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his Discourses, distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.Davidson, A.I. (1995) Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy, in Philosophy as a Way of Life, Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9‚Äì10 According to French philosopher Pierre Hadot, Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.Hadot, P. (1992) La Citadelle int√©rieure. Introduction aux Pens√©es de Marc Aur√®le. Paris, Fayard, pp. 106‚Äì15 Hadot writes that in the Meditations, \\"Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic topoi [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them.\\"Hadot, P. (1987) Exercices spirituels et philosophie antique. Paris, 2nd ed., p. 135. Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of reflective practice. Many parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern cognitive behavioral therapy have been identified. Stoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the consolatio literary tradition. Three such consolations by Seneca have survived. Stoics commonly employ ‚ÄòThe View from Above‚Äô, reflecting on society and otherness in a guided visualization, aiming to gain a \\"bigger picture\\", to see ourselves in context relevant to others, to see others in the context of the world, to see ourselves in the context of the world to help determine our role and the importance of happenings. Marcus Aurelius, Meditations, in Book 7.48 it is stated; > A fine reflection from Plato. One who would converse about human beings > should look on all things earthly as though from some point far above, upon > herds, armies, and agriculture, marriages and divorces, births and deaths, > the clamour of law courts, deserted wastes, alien peoples of every kind, > festivals, lamentations, and markets, this intermixture of everything and > ordered combination of opposites. Social philosophy A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its cosmopolitanism; according to the Stoics, all people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another. In the Discourses, Epictetus comments on man's relationship with the world: \\"Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy.\\"Epictetus, Discourses, ii. 5. 26 This sentiment echoes that of Diogenes of Sinope, who said, \\"I am not an Athenian or a Corinthian, but a citizen of the world.\\"Epictetus, Discourses, i. 9. 1 They held that external differences, such as rank and wealth, are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as Cato the Younger and Epictetus. In particular, they were noted for their urging of clemency toward slaves. Seneca exhorted, \\"Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies.\\"Seneca, Moral letters to Lucilius, Letter 47: On master and slave, 10, circa AD 65. Influence on Christianity Justus Lipsius, founder of Neostoicism In his introduction to the 1964 Penguin Classics edition of Meditations, the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which \\"had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe\\". In St. Ambrose of Milan's Duties, \\"The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of Zeno.\\" Regarding what he called \\"the Divine Spirit\\", Stanisforth wrote: > Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', > had been the first to hit upon the term pneuma, or 'spirit', to describe it. > Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance > akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality > of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul > and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the > 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly > manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated‚Äîin the > Christian as in the Stoic mind‚Äîwith the ideas of vital fire and beneficient > warmth. Regarding the Trinity, Staniforth wrote: > Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of > Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the > Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the > universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, > sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes > Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at > its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further > assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, > was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions. The apostle Paul met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in . In his letters, Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new Gentile converts in their understanding of Christianity.Kee, Howard and Franklin W. Young, Understanding The New Testament, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, Inc. 1958, p. 208. Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of St. Ambrose, Marcus Minucius Felix, and Tertullian.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Stoicism. ¬ßStoic elements in Pauline and patristic thought The Fathers of the Church regarded Stoicism as a \\"pagan philosophy\\";Agathias. Histories, 2.31. nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms \\"logos\\", \\"virtue\\", \\"Spirit\\", and \\"conscience\\".Ferguson, Everett. Backgrounds of Early Christianity. 2003, p. 368. But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity‚Äîor \\"persistent evil\\"‚Äîof humankind, and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage Ascesis with respect to the passions and inferior emotions, such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed. Stoic writings such as Meditations by Marcus Aurelius have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Oriental Orthodox Church accept the Stoic ideal of dispassion to this day. Middle and Roman Stoics taught that sex is just within marriage, for unitive and procreative purposes only.Musonius Rufus. \\"Lecture XII \\"On Sexual Indulgence\\".\\" Musonius Rufus: The Roman Socrates (Lectures and Fragments), Introduction and Translation by Cora E. Lutz, From Volume X of the Yale Classical Studies, Yale University Press, 1947The Making of Fornication: Eros, Ethics, and Political Reform in Greek Philosophy and Early Christianity. From University of California Press, 2003 This teaching is accepted by the Catholic Church to this day. Saint Ambrose of Milan was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology.

It was located approximately 10 kilometers northeast of Fontainebleau and 8 kilometers southeast of Melun.  History  Barbeau Abbey was founded in 1147 by King Louis VII of France on the banks of the Seine, whence the original name Seine-Port, or Sequanae Portus, in Latin. It was transferred to its present site in 1156. The present name is supposedly derived from the French word for barbel, which is also depicted in the abbey's arms. According to the foundation legend a barbel was fished out of the Seine and found to contain a ring mounted with a precious stone that was lost by Saint Loup as he crossed the river, the sale of which raised the funds to build the monastery. In 1180 Louis VII was buried in the abbey. His bones were transferred to St. Denis' Abbey in 1817. The abbey prospered until the Hundred Years' War. In approximately 1420 the monks were driven out of the abbey and spent the next 40 years in Melun. After their return in 1460 the monastery was restored and enlarged. The abbey suffered further damage in the Wars of Religion. Under the commendatory abbot Cardinal Wilhelm Egon von F√ºrstenberg the church was again restored. The abbey was suppressed in 1791 during the French Revolution and set on fire in 1793 by the Sansculottes. The state bought the remaining buildings back in 1810 for use as an orphanage, but sold them in 1837 to a private owner who demolished them and built a country house on the site. A riding school now occupies the former site.  Buildings  There are few remains of the abbey apart from an ice-cellar. The church of Fontaine-le-Port has preserved some of the 16th-century wooden sculptures from the abbey church, and a chapel in the same village is also said once to have been the abbey's. The church of H√©ricy owns an 18th-century altar from the monastery.  References  * Peugniez, Bernard, nd: Routier cistercien (p. 168). Moisenay: Editions Gaud.

The Germans disarmed over a million Italian troops within a matter of days, annihilating the Italian military and state. Several German divisions had entered Italy after the fall of Benito Mussolini in July 1943, while Italy was officially still an ally of Germany, despite the protests of the new Italian government under Pietro Badoglio. The Armistice of Cassibile was made public on 8 September. German forces moved rapidly to take over the Italian zones of occupation in the Balkans and southern France, and to disarm Italian forces in Italy. In some cases, the Italian troops, that had no superior orders and suffered many desertions, resisted the Germans, most notably in the Greek island of Cephalonia, where over 5,100 men of the 33rd Acqui Division were massacred after running out of ammunition and surrendering; in Rome, after the royal family and the government had fled, a disorganized defense by the Italian troops stationed around the capital was unable to defeat the German attack. Additionally, individual soldiers or whole units, like the 24th Pinerolo Division in Thessaly, went over to the local resistance movements. Only in Sardinia, Corsica, Calabria and in the southern part of Apulia were Italian troops able to offer successful resistance and hold off the Germans until relieved by the arrival of the Allies.  German plan  The first German combat units were sent to Italy to bolster its defenses against a probable Allied attack on Italian soil while Germany and Italy were still allies. The decision to create German units in Italy was taken during the final phase of the Tunisian Campaign; on 9 May 1943, two days after the fall of Tunis, the German High Command (OKW) informed the Italian Supreme Command (Comando Supremo) that three new German units would be formed, mostly employing second-line German units evacuated from North Africa. They would be the Sardinia Command (later 90th Light Infantry Division), the Sicily Command (later 15th Infantry Division), and a \\"ready reserve\\". Adolf Hitler wrote to a dubious Benito Mussolini that since they were weak units that needed reinforcements, two additional German divisions would be sent from France. The Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann G√∂ring arrived mid-May 1943 and was sent to Sicily, and the 16th Panzer Division arrived in early June and was sent west of Bari. On 19 May also, the headquarters of general Hans Hube's XIV Panzer Corps was also sent from France to strengthen the command structure of the Commander-in-Chief South (Oberbefehlshaber S√ºd), Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. On 20 May 1943, during a prolonged discussion at his headquarters, Hitler expressed his doubts about the political stability of the Fascist government and the danger of a collapse of his Italian ally. A special report by the German diplomat Alexander von Neurath exposed the declining morale of the Italian population and the pro-British sentiment spreading through the high bourgeoisie and the military, and Hitler was convinced that the situation in the Mediterranean needed great attention, and a detailed plan had to be prepared in case of a collapse of Italy or an overthrow of Mussolini. More reports about a speech delivered by the Italian diplomat Giuseppe Bastianini, information by Heinrich Himmler's men in Italy and the presence in Sicily of General Mario Roatta, who was considered untrustworthy, strengthened Hitler's suspicions. On 21 May, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, the head of the OKW, issued guidelines developed to respond to the possible defection of Italy from the Axis. The plan envisioned a series of operations in different theaters: Operation Alarich, the invasion of the Italian mainland; Operation Konstantin, the neutralization of the Italian forces in the Balkans; Operation Siegfried, occupation of the Italian-occupied areas in Southern France; Operation N√ºrnberg, to guard the Franco-Spanish frontier; Operation Kopenhagen, to control the passes on the French‚ÄìItalian frontier. Meanwhile, German reserves kept being redeployed to face potential threats in the Mediterranean theater. Hitler, seriously worried about the Balkans and in conflict with the Italian leadership and Mussolini himself because of collaboration agreements between the Italian and local partisan forces, decided to send the 1st Panzer Division to the Peloponnese and even considered the possibility of sending to Italy his three elite Waffen-SS armored divisions, currently deployed on the Eastern Front for Operation Citadel. On 17 June Mussolini, after a partial refusal, urgently asked for two German armoured divisions, as a reinforcement to confront the powerful Allied forces. After more arguments caused by another change of mind by Mussolini and by a proposal by General Vittorio Ambrosio, the Chief of Staff of the Italian armed forces, to turn down German reinforcements and to move to Italy the Italian troops deployed in France and the Balkans, the ever-deteriorating situation (during Operation Corkscrew, Pantelleria had surrendered without resistance on 11 June) induced Hitler to send three more German divisions: the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, the 29th Panzergrenadier Division (both newly reconstituted in France after their destruction at Stalingrad), and the 26th Panzer Division. The last of them was deployed at Salerno on 9 July. The 29th Panzergrenadier Division was sent to Foggia in mid-June and the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division was deployed north of Rome in the first days of July. Meanwhile, on 24 June, the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Brigade had been moved to Corsica, and in mid-July, the command of the 76th Panzerkorps (General Traugott Herr) also arrived.  Transfer of German forces to Italy   From the invasion of Sicily to the fall of Fascism  The Allied invasion of Sicily began on 10 July 1943, and established solid beachheads, despite Italian and German counterattacks. The political and military leaders of the two countries reacted immediately to the worsening situation. In Rome, Ambrosio urged unrealistic demands for help from Germany on Mussolini. Among the German commanders in Italy, Eberhard von Mackensen and Albert Kesselring became increasingly skeptical about Italian defense capabilities, and asked for reinforcements. Hitler, more and more worried about an Italian collapse, decided to send the 1st Fallschirmj√§ger-Division to Sicily immediately, and then sent the headquarters of XIV Panzer Corps (under General Hube) and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division, ready for deployment, to Reggio Calabria. On 17 July, Hitler decided to meet with Mussolini and his collaborators, and assess their resolve to continue the war. The meeting was near Feltre on 19 July 1943. On the same day, Rome was attacked by over 500 Allied bombers, which accelerated maneuvers by monarchists, high military officers, and even part of the Fascist leadership, more and more concerned with finding a way out of the war. The Feltre meeting had little use. Despite pleas by Ambrosio to present Italy's critical situation clearly and to ask for freedom of action to withdraw from the war, Mussolini was weak and indecisive and only asked for more German help in the defense of Italy, while Hitler made an exhausting speech in favor of fighting till the end. Moreover, Hitler gave an optimistic view of the situation and refused the sweeping Italian requests for more land and air support, mentioning technical and operative difficulties. But also, he did not heed the vehement requests of Jodl, Keitel, and Warlimont: to create an unified command in Italy under German control, to move the many Italian troops in northern Italy south (towards the regions attacked by the Allies), and to give command of the Axis forces in the theatre to General Wolfram von Richtofen. After the meeting, Hitler was convinced that he had lifted Mussolini's morale. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had been put in charge of forces being organized in Bavaria for intervention in case of Italy's defection (\\"Operation Alaric\\"). Rommel was worried about the fate of German troops in Sicily and southern Italy, which would be cut off from Germany by an Italian \\"betrayal\\". But Hitler ignored warnings from Rommel. On 21 July, Hitler decided to suspend the planning of \\"Alaric\\" and to send German reinforcements to Italy. On 25 July, before he learned of the fall of Mussolini, Hitler sent six Heer divisions to Italy, including a panzer division, and three Waffen-SS divisions. Rommel and his headquarters (then being organized in Munich) were sent to Thessaloniki to control a new army group in the Balkans.  German countermeasures after 25 July  Hitler and the German leadership were thus taken by surprise by the fall of Mussolini on 25 July; due to wrong information from the ambassador Hans Georg von Mackensen and by the military attach√© von Rintelen, they did not think that the meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism could threaten the Fascist regime, and they instead thought that Mussolini would be able to strengthen collaboration with the Third Reich. The news of the fall of Mussolini and the creation of a military government led by Marshal Pietro Badoglio surprised and enraged Hitler; he immediately understood that, despite assurances by Badoglio and Italian diplomats, the change of regime was a prelude to an Italian defection, which would endanger the German forces fighting in Southern Italy and the entire Wehrmacht presence in Southern Europe. At first Hitler thought about intervening immediately with the forces already on site to occupy Rome and arrest Badoglio, the king and the members of the new government; however he soon changed his mind and, together with Jodl and Rommel (whom had been urgently recalled from Greece) he decided to re-activate the planning of Operation \\"Alarich\\", to create a detailed plan to react to the Italian defection and swiftly occupy the Italian peninsula, after sending enough reinforcements. Kesselring was told to be ready to the change of sides and to prepare the withdrawal of his forces from Sicily, Sardinia and Southern Italy; new directives were issued, with new operational plans. In a matter of few days, the \\"Siegfried\\", \\"Konstantin\\", and \\"Kopenhagen\\" plans (ready since May) were confirmed, and new operations were studied: \\"Schwartz\\" to capture the Italian government in Rome, \\"Achse\\" to capture the Italian fleet, \\"Eiche\\" to free Mussolini from captivity, and \\"Student\\" to capture Rome. On 28 July, Hitler reviewed the operational planning: the \\"Konstantin\\" and \\"Alarich\\" plans were combined into a single plan for the occupation of Italy and the Balkans, which was called \\"Achse\\". On 5 August, on the advice of Admiral Ruge and because of the strengthening of the Italian defenses of Rome, the \\"Schwartz\\" plan was abandoned. Another problem for Hitler and the German leadership came from a lack of detailed information about Mussolini's fate and the refusal of Victor Emanuel III to meet Hitler, which would have been an occasion for a sudden attack on the new Italian leadership. While the planning was underway, the Wehrmacht command had begun the transfer of the divisions needed to enact the operations at the moment of the Italian defection. Starting on 27 July, the 2. Fallschirmj√§ger-Division of General Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke was moved by air from Southern France to the Pratica di Mare Air Base, a move that surprised both the Italian commands and Kesselring, as neither had been warned beforehand. Meanwhile, on 31 July, General Kurt Student (commander of the 11th Airborne Corps, and due to take command of Ramcke's paratroopers) and SS- Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Otto Skorzeny reached Kesselring in Frascati and illustrated to him the \\"Schwarz\\" plan, which was however soon cancelled by Hitler. Meanwhile, at 12:00 on 26 July Rommel had returned from Thessaloniki to Rastenburg, leaving command of the new Army Group F to Field Marshal Maximilian von Weichs, and on 29 July he assumed command in Munich of a fake command, denominated Auffrischungsstab M√ºnchen, to hide the creation of a new army group which on 14 August would be moved to Bologna under the name of Army Group B, and would enact Operation \\"Achse\\" in Northern Italy. At 02:15 on 26 July the 215th Infantry Division was the first German unit to enter Italy, heading for Ligury, while the Panzergrenadier Division Feldherrnhalle and the 715th Infantry Division were deployed to protect the passage through the alpine passes on the French-Italian border. The Italian commands protested and tried to stop the inflow of the divisions with some pretexts, but Kesselring intervened through the Italian Supreme Command on 1 August, and the 305th Infantry Division marched on foot first to Genoa and then to La Spezia. Meanwhile, more German units entered Italy: the 76th Infantry Division, on 2 August, heading for Savona; the 94th Infantry Division, on 4 August, heading for Susa and then Alessandria; the 87th Corps headquarters (General Gustav- Adolf von Zangen), which on 11 August established themselves in Acqui and assumed command of the three newly arrived German divisions. Some conflicts and incidents between the German troops on passage and the Italian commands and units took place also at Brenner Pass; Rommel, worried by the news of a strengthening of the Italian garrison and mining of the mountain passes, sent the Kampfgruppe Feuerstein south, with part of the 26th Panzer Division and the 44th Infantry Division, with orders to say that they had been sent to help Italy against the common enemy. The Italian Supreme Command in Rome and General Gloria, commander of the Italian 26th Corps in Bozen, complained vehemently and threatened an armed reaction, but after Kesselring's intervention on 1 August the crisis passed and the German units were allowed to proceed; the 44th Infantry Division reached Bozen, assumed control of the Brenner Pass and thus ensured the transalpine communications with Germany. Right after July 25, Hitler had initially decided to immediately send to Italy the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler and the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, despite the precarious situation on the Eastern Front. Protests by Field Marshal Von Kluge and further worsening of the situation in the East forced however Hitler to send only the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, without its heavy weapons. This division crossed the Brenner Pass on 3 August and then placed itself between Parma and Reggio Emilia. This was soon followed by the transfer of the 65th Infantry Division from Villach to the Ravenna‚ÄìRimini area, and the transfer of the 24th Panzer Division from Tyrol to Modena by 30 August. On 3 August the Waffen-SS Generaloberst Paul Hausser arrived in Reggio Emilia with the headquarters of the II SS Panzer Corps, to take command of the three incoming divisions. The last German division to enter Italy was the 71st Infantry Division, which was transferred from Denmark to an area north of Ljubljana on 7 August, and from 25 August started entering Friuli on orders from Rommel, who feared possible hostile actions by the Italians and the mining of the Eastern alpine passes. After another conflict with the Italian Supreme Command, which once again menaced to result in armed clashes, the situation was solved by the intervention of Von Rintelen, and the Division advanced without problems towards Gemona, Gorizia, and Opicina; by 2 September it was fully deployed in the Julian March.  8 September 1943   End of an alliance  Right after the removal of Mussolini from power, the new government led by Badoglio had officially proclaimed the decision to continue the war alongside Germany and kept reassuring the German leadership of its loyalty to the Axis cause, but at the same time it started a series of confused attempts to start secret negotiations with the Allies, to get out of the war and to avoid the consequences of a sudden change of sides. The need to gain time induced the new Italian government to make a show of loyalty to the alliance, asking for a more active participation of the German ally in the defense of the Italian peninsula and thus for the arrival of more German divisions, which however worsened the German threat to Italy. The Italian leadership tried to keep a grip on this difficult phase by alternating requests for help and obstructionism towards the incoming German forces and requests to deploy the German divisions in the South, on the frontline; already on 31 July, during the meeting between Ambrosio and Kesselring, arguments began about the positioning and role of the new German divisions. At the conference held in Tarvisio on 6 August between the Italian Foreign Minister Raffaele Guariglia, Ambrosio, Joachim von Ribbentrop and Keitel (with the menacing presence of SS guards), the mutual distrust became apparent; Ambrosio asked to increase the German divisions from nine to sixteen, but to deploy them in Southern Italy against the Allies, while Keitel and Warlimont instead stated that the new German units would be deployed in Central and Northern Italy, as a strategic reserve force. A last meeting was held in Bologna on 15 August, between generals Roatta and Jodl, the latter accompanied by Rommel (who had just been made commander of the new Army Group B in Northern Italy) and by a SS guard of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler; the Germans consented to recalling to Italy part of the Italian 4th Army from Southern France, but they were alarmed by Roatta's plans about a positioning of the German forces that, in case of defection, seemed to expose them to the risk of becoming isolated and being destroyed by the Allies. The meeting was a failure and convinced the German generals that, despite reassurances from Roatta (possibly not yet informed by Ambrosio of the contacts that were underway with the Allies), who assured that Italy would not defect and added \\"we are not Saxons!\\", that an Italian defection was imminent. The atmosphere at the meeting was so tense that the German delegation refused food and beverages offered by the Italians, fearing they would be poisoned. The preparations against an Italian betrayal therefore proceeded swiftly; detailed dispositions were issued to the subordinated commands, which in turn studied detailed operative plans to act with speed and efficiency. The German leadership expected only weak resistance by the Italian armed forces and counted on quickly solving the situation. General Von Horstig, a representative of the weaponry office of the Wehrmacht in Italy, was already preparing plans for the plunder of the resources and the systematic destruction of factories and infrastructures of military importance in Southern Italy. At the end of August, Hitler sent to Italy his new representatives: the diplomat Rudolf Rahn (who replaced the ambassador Von Mackensen) and General Rudolf Toussaint, who replaced Von Rintelen as military attach√©. Kesselring had already authorized General Hans Hube (in command of the XIV Panzer Corps), on orders from OKW, to organize the withdrawal of his four divisions from Sicily and its redeployment in Calabria, which Hube skillfully carried out on 17 August (Operation Lehrgang). The vast majority of the German troops in Sicily, after an effective fighting retreat, managed to cross the Straits of Messina and even to save a great part of the heavy equipment. In the following days Hube deployed the XIV Panzer Corps (16th Panzer Division, 15th Panzergrenadier Division, and Hermann Goring Division) in the area between Naples and Salerno, while the 1st Parachutist Division was sent to Apulia and General Herr with the 76th Panzerkorps assumed the defense of Calabria with part of the 26th Panzer Division and the 29th Panzergrenadier Division; his orders were to carry out delaying actions in case of Allied attack across the straits. On 3 September, indeed, XIII Corps of the British Eighth Army under General Bernard Law Montgomery crossed the straits northwest of Reggio Calabria (Operation Baytown), landed without meeting much resistance and started a cautious advance along the coastal roads towards Pizzo Calabro and Crotone. The 76th Panzerkorps avoided engagement and slowly retreated northwards.  The armistice  After some unrealistic and fruitless attempts by personalities of minor importance (embassy official Blasco Lanza D'Ajeta, Foreign Ministry official Alberto Berio, industrialist Alberto Pirelli) to contact the Allies and start negotiations for an exit of Italy from the war, possibly avoiding the dangerous consequences of a surrender at discretion and a German occupation, on 12 August General Giuseppe Castellano, Ambrosio's counselor, left Rome for Madrid, where he met the British ambassador Sir Samuel Hoare. The latter informed Churchill and then directed Castellano to Lisbon where, on 17 August, the first meeting with the Allied emissaries, General Walter Bedell Smith and politic advisers Kenneth Strong and George Frost Kennan, took place. The Allies' demands, definitively established by the Allied governments at the end of July, called for a completely unconditional surrender; Castellano thus found himself in great hindrance, as the instructions Badoglio had given him required to bargain the exit of Italy from the war and a strong military collaboration with the Allies, including the intervention of as many as fifteen British and American divisions that were to make contemporaneous landings north and south of Rome simultaneously with the announcement of the armistice, in order to defend the capital and deal with the German reaction. During a new meeting between Castellano and Bedell Smith in Cassibile, Sicily, on 31 August, the Italian envoy unsuccessfully insisted again to be made a part of the Allied operative details; the intervention of an American airborne division to protect Rome and the Italian government (Operation Giant 2) was agreed. On 1 September, after a consultation between the king, Guariglia and Ambrosio, the Allies were radioed the reception of the conditions of the armistice. On 3 September, Castellano and Bedell Smith therefore signed the armistice of Cassibile, in presence of the representatives of the British and American governments, Harold Macmillan and Robert Daniel Murphy; there was however a grievous mistake about the timing of the announcement of the Italian surrender. The Badoglio government hoped to gain more time to organize the resistance against the German forces, delaying the announcement at least till 12 September. Only in the night of 8 September did Badoglio learn from General Maxwell Taylor (the second-in- command of the 82nd Airborne Division, whose intervention was planned for \\"Giant 2\\", who had been secretly sent to Rome) that General Dwight Eisenhower would make the announcement that very evening. Badoglio protested and vainly tried to obtain another delay; the Italian leaders and generals, extremely worried about the German reaction, made an awful impression on General Taylor, who advised the Allied command to give up Operation \\"Giant 2\\", which he deemed to be destined to fail, given the disorganization of the sizable Italian forces stationed around Rome. In the morning of 8 September, Allied bombers bombed Kesselring's headquarters in Frascati. While they failed their objective and caused heavy civilian casualties, the Allied fleets approached the Gulf of Salerno to launch Operation Avalanche (the main landing of the 5th American Army of General Mark Wayne Clark). Badoglio, more and more anxious, sent Eisenhower a telegram asking for a deferment of the announcement of the armistice. The Allied commander-in-chief, sustained by an order from Washington of the Allied heads of state, firmly rejected the request, confirmed his intentions in a threatening tone, and cancelled Operation \\"Giant 2\\". At 18:00 on 8 September a hurried and dramatic Council of the Crown was held at the Quirinale Palace; the king, Badoglio, Ambrosio, Guariglia, General Giacomo Carboni (head of the Military Intelligence Service and commander of the Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato tasked with defending the capital), General Antonio Sorice (War Minister), Admiral Raffaele De Courten (Minister of the Navy), General Renato Sandulli (Minister of the Air Force), General Paolo Puntoni, General Giuseppe De Stefanis, and Major Luigi Marchesi (secretary of Ambrosio) participated. Faced with the clear instructions transmitted by Eisenhower and the first indiscretions leaking on foreign radios about the armistice, the Italian leadership, after heated discussions where Carboni went as far as to propose that they retracted Castellano's actions, finally agreed with Marchesi, who said that they should unavoidably keep the word they had given to the Allies, and confirm the news. At 18:30 General Eisenhower, speaking on Radio Algiers, officially announced the armistice, and at 19:42 Badoglio gave in turn the announcement via the public service broadcaster EIAR. During the previous days, the German representatives in Rome had been given reiterated statements of loyalty to the alliance, expressed at the highest levels; on 3 September Badoglio himself had confirmed to Rahn his firm will to remain at the side of Germany, and still on 6 September General Toussaint thought that the Italians had rejected the harsh demands of the Allies. Even in the morning of 8 September, Rahn met the king and the latter reassured him about his decision not to surrender, and in the afternoon Roatta reaffirmed by telephone that news coming from abroad were a propagandist hoax. Rahn was thus taken by surprise when at 19:00 on 8 September, having been warned by Berlin about the news of the armistice, he met Guariglia whom immediately confirmed the news and told him about the exit of Italy from the war and from the Axis alliance. Rahn replied bitterly, then hastily left Rome along with Toussaint and the embassy personnel and went to Frascati, where Kesselring's headquarters were located. Despite the initial surprise, the German response, having been accurately planned and organized in detail, was swift and effective; Hitler, who at 17:00 came back to Rastenburg after spending a few days in Ukraine at the headquarters of Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, soon learned of the armistice from a BBC transmission, and acted with extreme resolve. At 19:50, a few minutes after Badoglio had finished his announcement, the aide of General Jodl broadcast the coded word \\"Achse\\" to all subordinated commands; it was the signal for the German forces to attack Italian forces in all the war theaters of the Mediterranean.  Dissolution of Italian forces in Italy   Uncertainty and confusion  The Italian high commands, in the weeks leading to the armistice, had issued instructions for commanders and troops about the behaviour that should have been held in case of a withdrawal from the war and possible German aggressions; these orders were the No. 111 Order issued by the Staff of the Italian Army on 10 August, the OP 44 Memorandum issued on 26 August by General Roatta (on Ambrosio's orders) to the major peripheral commands (only twelve copies), and the No. 1 and No. 2 Memorandums issued on 6 September by the Supreme Command to the Staffs of the three armed forces, containing indications about the deployment of the forces in the different theaters. These were however general guidelines, lacking details and nearly inapplicable (also due to excessive secrecy measures); they were ineffective and they contributed, along with the vagueness of Badoglio's message on the evening of 8 September, to confuse the peripheral commands of the Italian forces about the unexpected news of the change of sides and the aggressiveness of the German forces, thus resulting in insecurity and indecision among those commands. The situation of the Italian armed forces was worsened by the contradictory instructions issued by Ambrosio in the evening of 8 September, which restricted any initiative to mere defensive measures in case of German attacks, and by Roatta in the night of 9 September, who especially demanded to avoid turmoil and ‚Äòseditions‚Äô among the troops. Faced with the efficiency of the German units, which immediately demanded surrender or collaboration with threats and intimidations, most of the Italian commanders, also fearful of the impressive reputation of military capacity of the Wehrmacht and many times tired by an unliked long lasting war, soon abandoned any intent of resistance; with a few exceptions, the troops, left with neither orders nor leaders, often dispersed. The situation of the German forces in Italy was actually a difficult one; Rommel, with his Army Group B, had the easier task of occupying the northern regions and neutralizing any resistance by Italian forces in that area, but Kesselring, in command of Army Group C, was in great difficulty after September 8: after the bombing of Frascati, he barely managed to receive the communication of the coded word \\"Achse\\" and also learned of the Allied landing near Salerno, where only part of the 16th Panzer Division was stationed. At first, he feared that he would not be able to simultaneously contain the Allied advance and carry out his mission against Rome. Even the OKW considered the possibility of the loss of the eight German divisions in Southern Italy; Kesselring, however, showed great capability, and his forces fought with ability and effectiveness. Despite advice by Rommel to quickly withdraw from Southern Italy and retreat to the La Spezia-Rimini line, Kesselring managed to avoid the isolation and destruction of his forces and also to cause trouble to the Allied bridgehead at Salerno, to counterattack with some success (after massing there the 14th and 76th Panzerkorps, with three Panzer divisions and two Panzergrenadier divisions) and then to retreat with minimal losses north of Naples, while simultaneously carrying out the \\"Achse\\" plan and capturing Rome with part of his forces.  Fall of Rome  In order to defend the political and military leadership and to resist to a possible German attack, the Italian commands had concentrated a considerable number of troops in the area around Rome; the main force consisted in the Corpo d'Armata Motocorazzato of General Carboni, composed of the 135th Armoured Division \\"Ariete II\\", the 136th Armoured Division Centauro II, the 10th Motorised Division Piave and the 21st Infantry Division Granatieri di Sardegna. Other units tasked with the defense of Rome were the 103rd Motorised Division Piacenza (part of the 17th Corps of General Giovanni Zangheri), the 12th Infantry Division Sassari and some battalions of the 13th Infantry Division Re and 7th Infantry Division Lupi di Toscana; overall, there were about 55,000 men and 200 armored fighting vehicles, with a numerical superiority on the German forces in the area. The German forces near Rome consisted in the 11th Airborne Corps of General Kurt Student, headquartered in Pratica di Mare; the Corps comprised the 2nd Parachutist Division (General Walter Barenthin), ready for action south of Rome, and the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division (General Fritz-Hubert Gr√§ser), reinforced by an armored battalion of the 26th Panzer Division (Kampfgruppe B√ºsing), stationed between Orvieto and Lake Bolsena, north of Rome. These units comprised about 26,000 men and some hundreds armored fighting vehicles, and were activated by Kesselring in the evening of 8 September: already at 20:30 they attacked the Mezzocamino fuel depot, and the German paratroopers immediately started advancing south, overcoming sporadic resistance by the Piacenza Division in Lanuvio, Albano Laziale, and Ardea. After reaching the EUR district at 21:30, the 2nd Parachutist Division overpowered some units of the Piacenza and Granatieri di Sardegna Divisions and after half an hour, advancing along the Via Ostiensis, reached the Magliana bridge. Meanwhile, the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division advanced from north along the Via Aurelia, Via Cassia, and Via Flaminia, but was halted near Lake Bracciano by the Armored Division Ariete II (General Raffaele Cadorna) and suspended its advance after some negotiations. The paratroopers, instead, went ahead with their action; fierce fighting erupted at Magliana between the German forces and the Granatieri di Sardegna, supported by armored units of the Ariete II Division, but at 02:00 on 9 September the Ciampino airport was captured, and an hour later news came that German troops had arrived in Tor Sapienza, along Via Prenestina, just eight km away from the city center. More and more alarming news pushed the political and military leadership, after some uncertain orders by Ambrosio to try to contact Kesselring, to decide to abandon the city. Roatta exhorted the king and Badoglio to leave Rome by the Via Tiburtina, then he ordered his forces to try to retreat to Tivoli and finally he abandoned the city himself, leaving Carboni without any order. Carboni in turn fled in civilian clothes, then re- entered the city in the morning of 10 September, when the situation was definitely compromised. General Umberto Utili, head of the Operations Division of the General Staff, declared the General Staff as formally dissolved in the morning of 9 September; the subordinate commands and the troops showed signs of bewilderment and confusion. Meanwhile, at 5:10 on 9 September the King and Badoglio, along with high-ranking officers, dignitaries and family members, fled Rome on seven cars; without encountering any difficulties, they passed Tivoli and Avezzano and reached Pescara and later Ortona, where more fleeing officers had gathered. There the King, his relatives, Badoglio, Ambrosio, and Roatta boarded the corvette Baionetta, which reached Brindisi at 14:30 on 10 September, the city having already been reached by Allied troops which had safely landed in Italian-controlled Taranto (the British 1st Airborne Division), Brindisi, and Bari (two divisions of the 5th Corps) during Operation Slapstick. Meanwhile, the defenses of Rome had completely collapsed; in the south, the German paratroopers fought a series of sporadic fights against the Granatieri di Sardegna and units of the Ariete II at Magliana and Cecchignola; at 17:00 on 9 September, Magliana was abandoned by Italian forces and the 2nd Parachutist Division proceeded with its advance, arriving near Porta San Paolo in the evening. In the north, the armored fighting vehicles of the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division had restarted their advance; after fighting against the bulk of the Ariete II, they captured Manziana, Monterosi (at 14:00), and Bracciano (at 17:00), while more German units of the same Division advanced towards Civitavecchia and Kampfgruppe B√ºsing reached Cesano and La Storta. At 20:00 the Piave and Ariete II divisions, as they had been ordered, left their positions and retreated towards Tivoli, while units of the Sassari and Re divisions were deployed along the Via Cassia and Via Salaria. The parachutists of Major Walter Gericke, whom had been parachuted at 09:00 over Monterotondo with the task of capturing the Italian Army headquarters (which however had already been abandoned), were engaged in hard fighting, which they ended in success in the evening of 9 September; meanwhile, units of the 2nd Parachutist Division attacked Porta San Paolo, two kilometers from Piazza Venezia, held by Granatieri di Sardegna units and groups of civilian volunteers. The German troops, mainly consisting in veterans, overcame this resistance after some fierce fighting, and reached the center of Rome in the morning of 10 September. General Siegfried Westphal, Chief of Staff of Army Group C, had started negotiations with Colonel Giaccone of the Centauro II Armoured Division (the former \\"M\\" Armoured Division, composed of blackshirts whose allegiances were highly doubtful, which had led the Italian commands to decide to keep it away from the battle), on instructions from Kesselring and Student, in the evening of 9 September. After a series of threats and an ultimatum, Westphal obtained the capitulation of Rome by the afternoon of 10 September, after discussions with Generals Carboni and Sorice and Marshal Enrico Caviglia, while German artillery was already firing directly inside the city. Westphal promised to spare the city and authorized the creation of a provisional Italian command under General Giorgio Calvi di Bergolo. This evanescent agreement was soon revoked by the Germans; by 15 September all Italian troops were disarmed, on 23 September Calvi di Bergolo was arrested and the German and RSI forces, under Generals Stahel and Chieli, respectively, assumed control of the city; despite this, they stated that the status of \\"open city\\" was maintained. This status was never recognized by the Allies, and the Germans exploited it to use Rome as a key logistic junction for the supplies sent to the frontline. Meanwhile, the Italian units that had retreated towards Tivoli dissolved; a considerable part of the Sassari and Piacenza divisions and of the 211th Coastal Division escaped capture and crossed the frontline, thus joining the Allies, but most of the men of the ten Italian divisions in the area were disarmed. Only a small part of them, however, were interned or deported; the majority was allowed to return to their homes. Overall German casualties for the capture of Rome were about a hundred dead and about 500 wounded, while Italian casualties were 984 killed, of whom 659 were soldiers, 121 civilians, and 204 \\"unidentified\\".  Disintegration of Italian forces in southern Italy  Field Marshal Kesselring, despite being busy with avoiding the isolation of his forces and containing the Allied attacks launched in three different landing areas (Salerno, Apulia and Calabria), still managed to retain control of the situation and to carry out the tasks assigned within the \\"Achse\\" plan. He managed to quickly dissolve the Italian forces stationed in his area, to capture Rome, and to disengage mobile units that were to be sent south against the Allies (the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division, after capturing Rome, reached Salerno on 12 September), but he had to restrict himself to summarily disarming the majority of the captured soldiers, then sending them back to their homes. Only 24,294 of the 102,340 Italian soldiers captured by Army Group C were held captive. Italian forces in Campania were weak and were quickly overwhelmed by the German troops; the Naples garrison was destroyed after two days of resistance by a German armored column, and its commander, Colonel Olivier, was executed. The 19th Corps was dissolved on 11 September after its commander, General Del Tetto, abandoned his command post to take shelter in a monastery; the 9th Motorised Division Pasubio (stationed in the Naples area), which was still being re-formed after its near destruction on the Eastern Front, was immediately disarmed, while in the Salerno area the 222nd Coastal Division was attacked and dispersed by the 16th Panzer Division, and its commander, General Ferrante Vincenzo Gonzaga, was killed after refusing to surrender. The 7th Italian Army of General Mario Arisio was stationed in Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia; German forces in these regions were scarce, and were being moved north. On 9 September, the 7th Army headquarters in Potenza were attacked by surprise and captured by German troops, but the overall weakness of the German forces and the swift intervention of the Allied forces helped the Italian units, the majority of whom maintained unit cohesion. The 9th Corps (General Roberto Lerici) held central and northern Apulia, despite the collapse of the 209th Coastal Division; General Nicola Bellomo held the harbour of Bari until Allied forces arrived, while more south the 51st Corps of General De Stefani held its positions between Grottaglie and Lecce with the 58th Infantry Division Legnano, the 152nd Infantry Division Piceno and the 210th Coastal Division. The situation of the 31st Corps (General Mercalli), stationed in Calabria with three coastal divisions and the 104th Motorised Division Mantova, was more difficult: it was attacked by the 76th Panzerkorps and sustained casualties, and part of the 185th Parachute Regiment decided to remain loyal to the previous alliance with Germany and joined the 1st German Parachute Division. General Frido von Senger und Etterlin, the German commander in Sardinia, was ordered by Kesselring to withdraw to Corsica with the 90th Panzergrenadier Division. This manoeuvre was a complete success; the Italian forces present in the area (consisting of the 184th Airborne Division Nembo, the 31st Infantry Division Calabria, the 30th Infantry Division Sabauda, the 47th Infantry Division Bari, the 203rd Coastal Division, the 204th Coastal Division and the 205th Coastal Division), under General Antonio Basso, lacked mobility and did not go into action until 12 September; due to previous agreements made with the German commands, they did not impede the transfer of the German forces to Corsica, which was completed by 18 September with a few wounded caused by a skirmish near Oristano. A battalion of the Nembo Division, which had reacted negatively to the news of the armistice, mutinied, killed the divisional chief of staff, Colonel Alberto Bechi Lucerna, and joined the 90th Panzergrenadier Division. In Corsica, after initial confusion and fruitless negotiations, General Giovanni Magli, commander of the 7th Corps (20th Infantry Division Friuli and 44th Infantry Division Cremona), attacked the Waffen-SS \\"Reichf√ºhrer-SS\\" brigade, while some French units landed at Ajaccio on 12 September. On 13 September, following the arrival of the 90th Panzergrenadier Division from Sardinia, Bastia (where a previous German attempt to capture the port and Italian shipping had been thwarted by Italian ships) fell in German hands, but the Wehrmacht Supreme Command ordered General Von Senger to leave the island and withdraw to Piombino. The German forces were evacuated from Corsica by 4 October, despite attacks by the Italian and French forces (the latter consisting of the 4th Moroccan Mountain Division). On 12 September, paratrooper units under Major Harald Mors, which also included the SS officer Otto Skorzeny (who had located the different prisons where Mussolini had been held), carried out Operation \\"Eiche\\" and freed Mussolini from detention in Campo Imperatore, Gran Sasso; this was an essential premise for the creation of a new fascist collaborationist government wanted by Hitler.  Disintegration of Italian forces in central and northern Italy  The strategic situation in central and northern Italy was much more favorable to the Germans than in the south. Army Group B, under Field Marshal Rommel, had a considerable number of troops, was far away from possible Allied intervention, and its units were deployed so as to be ready to intervene against Italian units, which were much less prepared and lacked clear orders. Moreover, the behavior of many of the Italian commanders further favored the success of the \\"Achse\\" plan: the local Italian superior commands, mostly concerned with avoiding riots, devastation, and popular insurrections, refused the help of civilians in the resistance, sometimes autonomously dissolved their units, and started negotiations with the Germans for an uneventful handover. Even the civilian leadership of the major cities carried out the instructions of the chief of police, Carmine Senise, mostly aimed at avoiding riots, and thus collaborated with the German authorities. Under such circumstances, Rommel carried out his task with speed and efficiency, while many Italian units quickly disintegrated and offered little resistance; Army Group B strictly carried out the orders about the internment of Italian troops, and by 20 September, 183,300 of the 13,000 officers and 402,000 soldiers captured had already been sent to Germany. German units in Piedmont quickly neutralized the Italian units; in Turin (where General Enrico Adami Rossi refused to arm the civilians ‚Äì on 18 August, he had ordered his men to fire on the crowd during a popular demonstration ‚Äì and immediately initiated negotiations) and Novara (where General Casentino surrendered his entire command) the high commands did not attempt any resistance, immediately handed over their weapons and surrendered with their disintegrating units; Adami Rossi surrendered as soon as German armored units entered Turin (he later joined the Italian Social Republic). In Ligury, by 11 September the German troops of the 87th Corps (76th and 94th Infantry Division) and the 51st Corps (65th and 305th Infantry Division) occupied all positions, while the 16th Italian Corps (105th Motorised Division Rovigo and 6th Alpine Division Alpi Graie) dissolved; German units also entered the naval base of La Spezia, but the Italian fleet had already sailed, while ships unable to sail had been scuttled or sabotaged. In Milan, General Vittorio Ruggero, commander of the garrison, bought time for 48 hours and then reached an agreement with a German colonel of the 1st SS Panzer Division \\"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\\"; Ruggero dissolved without a fight the 5th Infantry Division Cosseria, which was being re-formed after the heavy losses suffered in Russia, and already on the following day the Waffen- SS units broke the agreement, occupied Milan and arrested Ruggero, who was sent to POW camps in Germany along with his soldiers. After a brief resistance, the garrison of Verona and its commander, General Guglielmo Orengo, were disarmed and deported by the German forces. Despite the Alpine Wall fortifications, Italian units quickly disintegrated also in Trentino- South Tyrol: by 9 September, the two alpine divisions of the 35th Corps of General Alessandro Gloria (2nd Alpine Division Tridentina and 4th Alpine Division Cuneense, but under re-constitution after their destruction on the Eastern Front) were immediately attacked and disarmed by the 44th German Infantry Division, which was already deployed south of Brenner Pass, and by the \\"Doelha\\" Brigade; only in Rovereto did some units resist until the morning of 10 September, before surrendering. In Emilia, the 2nd SS-Panzerkorps of General Paul Hausser occupied the territory and destroyed the weak Italian units in the area without difficulty: the 24th Panzer Division and \\"Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler\\" quickly entered Modena and Bologna; the 3rd Cavalry Division Amedeo Duca d'Aosta, which was being re-formed after the losses suffered in Russia, was disarmed, and the soldiers taken prisoner. The 71st German Infantry Division encountered more difficulty in occupying Friuli and the Julian March; whereas the 3rd Alpine Division Julia and the 2nd Mountain Infantry Division Sforzesca, both being re-formed after their destruction in Russia, were soon disarmed, the 52nd Motorised Division Torino put up resistance in Gorizia, where workers formed the first partisan groups. Meanwhile, Slovene partisan formations invaded part of this region, where they often inflicted bloody reprisals against the Italian civilian population. Only towards the end of the month, the 71st German Infantry Division, assisted by Italian collaborationist soldiers of the Italian Social Republic, regained control of the situation, repelled the Yugoslav partisans and occupied all the territory. In Trieste, General Alberto Ferrero, after fruitless talks with anti-fascist representatives, started negotiations with the Germans and then abandoned the city, and 90,000 Italian soldiers in the area, abandoned without orders, surrendered without a fight. In central Italy north of Rome, the 5th Italian Army of General Mario Caracciolo di Feroleto, headquartered in Orte, was dissolved on 11 September, and its soldiers were disarmed and interned; the 3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna, headquartered in Grosseto, and the coastal formations of the northern Tyrrhenian Sea disintegrated, and German units entered the cities; Livorno was captured on 10 September. In Florence, General Chiappa Armellini immediately allowed the Germans to enter the city; Colonel Chiari in Arezzo and Colonel Laurei in Massa gave up their forces without attempting any resistance. Italian units and civilian volunteers in Piombino repelled a German landing attempt between 10 and 11 September, killing or capturing some hundreds of German soldiers, but on 12 September the Italian superior commands surrendered the town to the Germans. Army Group B completed its task by 19 September, occupying all of central and northern Italy, disarming and capturing a great part of the Italian troops and sizable booty, that included 236 armored fighting vehicles, 1,138 field guns, 536 anti-tank guns, 797 anti-aircraft guns, 5,926 machine guns and 386,000 rifles. Along with 13,000 officers and 402,000 Italian soldiers, 43,000 Allied prisoners, previously held by the Italians, were also captured. Rommel organized a quick transfer to Germany of the captured Italian soldiers, which were sent through the Brenner Pass, partly by train, partly on foot.  Disintegration of Italian forces abroad   France  The 4th Italian Army of General Mario Vercellino, consisting of the 5th Alpine Division Pusteria, the 2nd Cavalry Division Emanuele Filiberto Testa di Ferro and the 48th Infantry Division Taro, was on its way from Provence to Italy when news of the armistice came; panic immediately spread among the troops, and rumors about the aggressiveness and brutality of the German troops caused demoralization and disintegration of the units towards the border. The army, dispersed between France, Piedmont and Liguria, disintegrated between 9 and 11 September, under the pressure of the converging German forces of Field Marshals Gerd von Rundstedt (from Provence) and Erwin Rommel (from Italy). Taking advantage of the disintegration of the Italian units, the German troops swiftly captured all positions: the 356th and 715th Infantry Division entered Toulon and reached the Var river, while the Panzergrenadier Division Feldherrnhalle occupied the riviera till Menton. Mont Cenis pass, held by Italian units, was attacked in a pincer movement by German units from France (units of the 157th and 715th Infantry Division) and Piedmont (units of the Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, coming from Turin); the Italian garrison defended the pass for some time, then surrendered after blowing up part of the Fr√©jus Rail Tunnel. Most soldiers of the 4th Army dispersed and tried to reach their homes; some others decided to remain with the Germans, whereas sizeable groups chose to oppose the occupation and went into the mountains, where they joined groups of anti-fascist civilians and thus formed the first partisan groups in Piedmont. On 12 September, General Vercellino formally dissolved his Army, while General Operti secured the Army treasure, part of which would later be used to fund the resistance.  Balkans  Italian forces in the Balkans (Slovenia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Bosnia, Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania and Greece) amounted to over 30 divisions and 500,000 soldiers, who had been engaged for two years in waging counter-guerrilla operations against Yugoslav and Greek partisans. Italian forces in the area consisted of the 2nd Army (General Mario Robotti) in Slovenia and Dalmatia, of the 9th Army (General Lorenzo Dalmazzo), stationed in Albania and under the control of Army Group East of General Ezio Rosi (which also included the troops in Bosnia and Montenegro), and of the 11th Army (General Vecchierelli) in Greece, the latter under Army Group E of General Alexander L√∂hr. Italian troops in the area were exhausted after years of wearing anti-partisan operations, characterized by brutalities, reprisals and repression, and were isolated in a hostile territory, mixed with numerous German divisions (over 20 divisions of Army Group F of Field Marshal Von Weichs, and of Army Group E of General L√∂hr) and Croat collaborationist units whom, on 9 September, immediately severed all ties with Italy and joined Germany in the fight against the former ally. Without any land connection, and with confusing and vague orders, units quickly disintegrated and many soldiers were disarmed, captured and deported to Germany. However, Italian soldiers in this area fought with more determination than the units left in Italy, suffering heavy casualties and harsh reprisals by the German units. Some units managed to escape capture and joined Yugoslav or Greek partisan formations, subsequently fighting alongside them; the population was often friendly towards the soldiers, and helped them. German forces, less numerous but more mobile, determined and well-led, and enjoying complete air supremacy, quickly prevailed, brutally crushing Italian resistance, often summarily executing Italian officers, and occupying all the Balkan region; 393,000 Italian soldiers were captured and deported, about 29,000 joined the Germans, 20,000 joined Partisan formations, and 57,000 dispersed or hid and tried to survive. The 5th, 11th and 18th Corps which formed the 2nd Army, stationed in Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia, were attacked by two Croat and three German divisions; General Gastone Gambara, commander of the 11th Corps, started negotiations in Fiume and then abandoned his troops on 14 September, leaving them to be captured; Pola also fell without resistance. On 11 September the divisions stationed in Dalmatia were ordered to avoid any resistance in the hope of a peaceful repatriation, but the subordinate units refused, and started fighting against the Germans. The 14th Infantry Division Isonzo, 22nd Infantry Division Cacciatori delle Alpi and 153rd Infantry Division Macerata were dissolved, whereas the 57th Infantry Division Lombardia and the 154th Infantry Division Murge resisted in Susak and Karlovac; the 158th Infantry Division Zara surrendered on 10 September and its commanders were deported, while in Split the 15th Infantry Division Bergamo made an agreement with Yugoslav partisans and defended the town till 27 September against the 7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen, sent from Mostar; after surrender, three Italian generals (Alfonso Cigala Fulgosi, Raffaele Pelligra and Angelo Policardi) and 46 officers were executed. The 1st Cavalry Division Eugenio di Savoia, stationed in Dalmatia, was dispersed. Italian forces in Albania consisted of the six divisions of the 9th Army (General Dalmazzo); the headquarters of Army Group East (General Rosi) was in Tirana. Left without clear orders, Italian commanders showed indecision and insufficient fighting spirit; on the contrary, German forces (Superior Command \\"Kroazia\\" with two chasseurs divisions, one mountain division and the 1st Panzer Division) acted swiftly and with great aggressiveness. In the morning of 11 September, the command of Army Group East was surrounded and General Rosi was immediately captured along with his officers, while General Dalmazzo did not react to the German attacks, did not issue any order of resistance and started negotiations with the Germans, hastening the disintegration of his forces. The 11th Infantry Division Brennero (whose commander, General Princivalle, kept an ambivalent behavior), 38th Infantry Division Puglie, 49th Infantry Division Parma and 53rd Infantry Division Arezzo handed over their weapons and were dissolved (most men of the Brennero Division however managed to return to Italy by sea, while a considerable part of the men of the Arezzo Division escaped and joined the partisans), while the 41st Infantry Division Firenze (General Arnaldo Azzi) and the 151st Infantry Division Perugia (General Ernesto Chiminello) tried to resist. The Firenze Division faced the Germans in battle but was defeated near Kruja, after which the Division was dissolved and its men joined the partisan formations; the Perugia Division retreated to Porto Edda after a fighting retreat and some of its men managed to embark on ships headed for Italy, but most of the division, weakened by the exhausting march through the Albanian mountains and the continuous attacks, was surrounded and surrendered on 22 September, after which General Chiminello and 130 officers were executed. Some survivors joined the partisans, forming the Antonio Gramsci Battalion. Over 15,000 dispersed Italian soldiers were sheltered by the population; the 21st German Mountain Corps established its headquarters in Tirana already on 10 September. Overall, about 90,000 Italian soldiers were captured in Albania, whereas a further 45,000 evaded capture and dispersed around the country; some of them were sheltered by the population in exchange for their labour, while many others succumbed to cold and starvation (British documents estimated mortality among Italian soldiers in Albania at about one hundred deaths per day in the winter of 1943-1944). In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the 18th Infantry Division Messina resisted for four days, while the 32nd Infantry Division Marche tried to defend Dubrovnik, but the German forces crushed its resistance; the commander of the Division, General Giuseppe Amico, was captured by the Germans during a parley and released to convince his men to surrender, but he instead rallied them against the Germans. Recaptured later, he was executed. In Montenegro, the 23rd Infantry Division Ferrara disintegrated, while the 155th Infantry Division Emilia defended the Bay of Kotor till 16 September, then it had to surrender; the soldiers of the 19th Infantry Division Venezia and of the 1st Alpine Division Taurinense joined Tito's partisans and formed the \\"Garibaldi\\" partisan Division, which kept fighting against the Germans, despite some violent \\"incomprehensions\\" with the Yugoslavs, till March 1945. In mainland Greece, as elsewhere, uncertainty and ambivalent behavior of the Italian superior officers favored a rapid German success; Italian forces in this region, consisting of the 11th Army with headquarters in Athens, were subordinate to Army Group E of General L√∂hr, whom had numerically inferior but more efficient units (three chasseurs divisions, part of the 1st Panzer Division and a Luftwaffe field division). General Carlo Vecchierelli, commander of the 11th Army, issued at first an order dictating that no initiatives were to be taken against the Germans, and on 9 September, believing the German assurances of safe-conducts to return to Italy, he ordered his troops to avoid any resistance and hand over the weapons to the Germans, without fighting. The consequence was the disintegration of most of the units: the 29th Infantry Division Piemonte, 36th Mountain Infantry Division Forl√¨, 37th Mountain Infantry Division Modena, 56th Infantry Division Casale and 59th Mountain Infantry Division Cagliari were easily disarmed and their soldiers were captured and sent to Germany. The 24th Infantry Division Pinerolo, stationed in Thessalia, rejected Vecchiarelli's orders; General Adolfo Infante, after fighting in Larissa, retreated to the Pindus massif, where he tried to obtain collaboration of the ELAS partisans. At first the Greek partisans agreed, but then they attacked the Aosta Cavalry Division to capture their weapons; Infante left for Italy, and his men were dispersed among the local population under the guidance of EAM/ELAS in order to be fed and survive the winter. After being ordered to disarm his unit or transfer it to German command, Angelico Carta the commander of the 51st Infantry Division Siena stationed in east Crete, decided to side against the Italian Social Republic. He contacted the Special Operations Executive (SOE) through the division's counter-intelligence officer, arranging that he and members of his staff sympathetic to the Allied cause be smuggled to Egypt along with the defense plans for the east of the island. After abandoning his car north-east of Neapoli as a diversion, Carta and his comrades set foot for south-west. Evading German patrols and observation planes he embarked a Motor Torpedo Boat at Soutsouro reaching Mersa Matruh the next afternoon, on 23 September 1943.  Ionian Islands and the Dodecanese  German commands believed that it would be of great importance to retain control of the Ionian Islands and the Dodecanese, garrisoned by Italian troops, as they were believed to be of great strategic importance as a peripheral naval and air base and a defensive stronghold against possible Allied attacks on the Balkan front. Therefore, German forces launched a series of operations aimed at capturing the most important of these islands, with a sizable concentration of land and air forces. These operations caused some bloody battles against the Italian garrisons (who tried to resist, relying on their numerical superiority, geographical isolation and in some cases Allied assistance) and atrocities after surrender. The Allies, despite insistence from Winston Churchill who supported a powerful Allied intervention in these islands to support the Italian garrisons and to secure valuable naval and air bases (which would turn useful for attacks on the southern Balkan front of \\"Fortress Europe\\"), only sent weak contingents with scarce air support, and were thus unable to change the course of the events, which progressively turned in favor of the Wehrmacht. In Crete, the 51st Infantry Division Siena was immediately neutralized and disarmed by the German forces in the island (the \\"Kreta\\" fortress brigade and the 22nd Air Landing Division, a veteran of the German invasion of the Netherlands and of the Siege of Sebastopol); part of the Italian soldiers joined the Germans, whereas most of them were imprisoned and transferred to mainland Greece by sea, but at least 4,700 of them drowned in the sinking by Allied air and submarine attacks of two of the ships that were carrying them (Sinfra and Petrella). Rhodes also quickly fell to the Germans; Italian forces there (the 50th Infantry Division Regina and part of the 6th Infantry Division Cuneo, with 34,000 men), enjoyed numerical superiority over the German forces of General Kleeman (7,000 men of the \\"Rhodos\\" Division), but after an inconclusive battle the Italian commander, Admiral Inigo Campioni, surrendered when the Germans threatened to launch heavy bombings against the town of Rhodes. Karpathos was occupied by German forces on 13 September, after Campioni had ordered the island garrison to surrender. Over 6,500 Italian soldiers of the Rhodes garrison died after surrender, most of them in the sinking of the steamers Oria and Donizetti that were carrying them to mainland Greece; Campioni was later executed by Fascist authorities for having defended the island. British units landed in Leros and Kos, where they joined the Italian garrisons in contrasting the German invasion (carried out by the 22nd Air Landing Division), but mediocre coordination, better German efficiency and German air supremacy led to a German victory and the capture of both islands. Kos fell on 4 October, with 2,500 Italian and 600 British soldiers taken prisoners; 96 Italian officers, including the garrison commander (Colonel Felice Leggio), were executed. Leros, defended by its 7,600-strong Italian garrison reinforced by 4,500 British soldiers, resisted for much longer; after weeks of continuous bombing, on 12 November 2,700 German soldiers landed or were parachuted in different points of the island and, despite numerical inferiority, they prevailed by 16 September, forcing both Italians and British to surrender. The Italian commander, Rear Admiral Luigi Mascherpa, was later executed by RSI authorities, like Campioni. The most tragic events took place in the Ionian Islands, namely Corfu and Cephalonia, which the German command considered to be of utmost importance for defense of the Balkan coast against possible Allied landings. The Italian garrison on Cephalonia, consisting in the 33rd Mountain Infantry Division Acqui with 11,500 men under General Antonio Gandin, at first did not take any initiative against the much smaller German garrison (2,000 mountain troops under Lieutenant Colonel Hans Barge), and waited for clear orders. On 11 September, the Germans presented an ultimatum which ordered the Italians to surrender; Gandin at first decided to hand over the weapons, but after signs of protest and unrest among his men, he decided to resist. On 13 September, after receiving clear orders from the superior commands in Brindisi, Gandin rejected the ultimatum and attacked the German landing craft attempting to reach the island. On 15 September, the Germans intervened in force, landing five battalions of mountain troops of the 1st Mountain Division Edelweiss of General Hubert Lanz, supported by self- propelled guns. The Germans repelled the Italian attack and then, after fierce fighting, went on the offensive on 21 September and forced the Italians to surrender at 11:00 on 22 September. After the surrender, the Germans began a bloody reprisal; General Gandin, about 400 officers and 4,000 to 5,000 men of the Acqui Division were executed. 1,300 men had previously been killed in the battle, and another 1,350 subsequently perished in the sinking of ships that were carrying them to mainland Greece. In Corfu the 4,500-strong Italian garrison easily overpowered and captured the 500-strong German garrison; the German prisoners were transferred by sea to Italy (and their presence in Italian hands is probably the reason that prevented the Germans from committing another full-scale massacre like in Cephalonia), while the garrison was reinforced by 3,500 more men. Between 24 and 25 September, however, more German forces, with Luftwaffe support, landed in the island, and on 26 September the Italians, after losing some hundreds of men and running out of ammunition, surrendered. The Italian commander, Colonel Luigi Lusignani, was executed along with 28 of his officers; 1,302 Italian prisoners perished in the sinking of the motor ship Mario Roselli which was to transfer them to the mainland.  The Italian fleet  The clauses of the armistice specifically demanded the surrender of the Italian fleet, as the 'elimination' of the battleships of the Italian Royal Navy would allow a reduction of the Allied naval forces in the Mediterranean. Like their colleagues of the Army, the commanders of the Italian Navy also showed indecision and a lack of capability; the Chief of Staff, Admiral Raffaele de Courten, who had been forewarned of the armistice, remained undecided till the evening of 8 September whether he should comply and surrender the fleet, or order it to be scuttled. Moreover, till the evening of 8 September De Courten did not inform Admiral Carlo Bergamini, the commander of the Italian main battleship force based in La Spezia, about the armistice. Only at that point did he order a bewildered Bergamini to sail with his ship, heading for La Maddalena. Immediately thereafter, De Courten joined Badoglio and the king in their escape towards Brindisi, and he thus abandoned his command, leaving behind in Rome his deputy chief of staff, Admiral Luigi Sansonetti. The latter, despite his precarious situation, kept radio contact with the ships at sea till 12 September, when De Courten assumed command again. Bergamini, after a meeting to convince his reluctant officers of the need to abide by the orders, sailed from La Spezia only at 03:00 on 9 September; the consequence was that the Italian fleet was spotted in daylight and attacked at 14:00 by German aircraft which, employing new Fritz X guided bombs, sank Bergamini's flagship Roma. Bergamini perished along 1,393 of his men. Roma's sister ship Italia was damaged. After the sinking the rest of the fleet, now under Admiral Romeo Oliva, headed for Malta. A few destroyers and torpedo boats were left behind to pick up Roma's survivors, and afterwards reached the Balearic Islands, where they were interned by the Spanish authorities; two of them, Pegaso and Impetuoso, were scuttled near Mahon by their commanders, who did not want them interned or handed over to the Allies. The bulk of the fleet (including the battleships Italia and Vittorio Veneto and five light cruisers) reached Malta on 10 September; a smaller force from Taranto, including the battleships Duilio and Andrea Doria and three light cruisers, under Admiral Alberto Da Zara, had already been transferred there. A number of other Italian ships, mostly torpedo boats, corvettes and submarines, also flocked to Malta during the following days; the last Italian battleship, Giulio Cesare, arrived there on 13 September. While most of the operational ships of the Italian Navy managed to reach Allied-controlled ports, some were sunk on their way by German ships and aircraft; among them the destroyers Quintino Sella, Ugolino Vivaldi and Antonio Da Noli, the torpedo boats T 6 and T 8, the corvette Berenice, the submarine (sunk by Allied aircraft in unclear circumstances), the gunboat Aurora, the auxiliary cruiser Piero Foscari, the munition transport Buffoluto, the repair ship Quarnaro and the minelayer Pelagosa, as well as several motor torpedo boats, submarine chasers and smaller craft. Among the casualties was Rear Admiral Federico Martinengo, commander of the Italian anti-submarine forces, killed in action onboard submarine chaser VAS 234 during a skirmish with German R boats. In the Black Sea, the Italian flotilla of five CB-class midget submarines was seized by Romanian naval authorities, and despite strong German protest, the Romanian naval commander, Rear Admiral Horia Macellariu, stood his ground and the five midget submarines remained a new addition to the Royal Romanian Navy.Lawrence Paterson, Steel and Ice: The U-boat Battle in the Arctic and Black Sea 1941-45Jamie Prenatt, Mark Stille, Axis midget submarines: 1939-45, p. 15Paul Kemp, Midget Submarines of the Second World War, p. 65 A different fate was met by Italian warships in Crete and Greece, where German forces were prevailing; only the torpedo boat Monzambano managed to escape, while two destroyers and four torpedo boats were captured. Moreover, the torpedo boat Insidioso was captured in Pola, the torpedo boat T 7 was captured in Gru≈æ, the torpedo boat Giuseppe Missori was captured in Durres (a sistership, Rosolino Pilo, was also captured, but her crew later overpowered the German guards and reached an Italian-controlled port) and the submarines Francesco Rismondo and H 6 were captured in Bonifacio. The submarines Ametista and Serpente were scuttled by their commanders off Ancona. The armistice also meant the loss of all ships that were undergoing repair or maintenance work, or suffered from mechanical breakdown, or were unable to put to sea; these included the battleship Cavour, the heavy cruisers Gorizia and Bolzano, the light cruiser Taranto, eight destroyers, thirteen torpedo boats, eight corvettes and twenty submarines. Most of them were scuttled or sabotaged, the rest were captured. German forces also captured a number of ships under construction; among them the incomplete aircraft carrier Aquila and several Capitani Romani-class cruisers, Ariete- class torpedo boats, Gabbiano-class corvettes, Flutto-class submarines and R-class transport submarines. Many Ariete-class and Gabbiano-class ships were completed by the Germans and entered service with the Kriegsmarine. The majority of the officers and men of the Italian Navy were heavily disappointed by the order to surrender to the Allies; discipline was maintained, although there were some instances of insubordination, mutiny and attempts to prevent from surrendering some ships. The most notable episodes were the above- mentioned scuttling of the torpedo boats Pegaso and Impetuoso, the arrest of Rear Admiral Giovanni Galati, who insisted on scuttling the ships, and the mutiny of part of the crew of the battleship Giulio Cesare, who imprisoned its commander and planned to scuttle the ship, but was eventually persuaded to comply with the orders. Most of what remained of the Italian merchant fleet was captured by the German forces in Italian harbors.  The Italian air force  The Royal Italian Air Force was also taken completely by surprise by the armistice, and also in this case the high commands showed improvidence and ineptitude; the Chief of Staff, General Renato Sandalli, did not inform his subordinates till 5 September, then, in the night of 8 September, he ceded command to General Giuseppe Santoro and fled to Brindisi without issuing the executive orders of the planned directive (\\"Memorandum No. 1\\"). The Italian air bases did not receive any clear order and thus the air force was not employed against the German invaders, whom instead took the initiative and swiftly captured the main air bases in northern Italy, where most of the remaining aircraft were based. Only on 11 September Santoro ordered all units to take off to reach Allied-controlled air bases, while the commander of the Rome air bases, General Ilari, started negotiations and handed over bases and planes to the Germans. Out of about 800 operational aircraft, only 246 managed to reach Allied-controlled territory, while two-thirds of the planes fell in German hands, and 43 were shot down by Luftwaffe planes while flying south. Some fighter units decided to stay with the Axis and formed the core of the National Republican Air Force.  Aftermath  Already on 10 September, the OKW command issued a first communiqu√© announcing the annihilation of the Italian military apparatus. While many Italian units would fight on for days or weeks in the Greek islands and the Balkans and would retain control of Corsica, Sardinia, Apulia and Calabria, the major units of the Italian Army had effectively dissolved in the space of some days suffering widespread desertions. With the success of \\"Achse\\" and its secondary operations, the Wehrmacht achieved an important strategic success by securing the most important strategic positions in the Mediterranean theatre and overcoming great operative difficulties; it also captured large quantities of weapons, equipment and resources that turned useful in integrating the depleting resources of Germany. Over 20,000 Italian soldiers were killed in battle and nearly 800,000 were captured; over 13,000 of them drowned in the sinking of several ships that were carrying them from Aegean islands to the Greek mainland, and the others were not recognized prisoner of war status and were instead classified as \\"Italian Military Internees\\" and exploited for forced labour in Germany's war industry. Up to 50,000 of them died in German captivity. The Allies, whose objectives in the Mediterranean were rather limited (to push Italy out of the war and to keep part of the German forces engaged) and whose strategic planning presented heavy conflicts between British and Americans, were not able to exploit the Italian collapse and limited themselves to advancing up the Italian peninsula during a less than two years campaign, which required much land and air forces and resources. Also, the Germans, however, had to divert a considerable number of mobile and skilled units to Italy and the Balkans, troops that would have been more useful on the main Eastern and Western fronts, but that allowed them to keep war away from the southern regions of Germany, to protect rich industrial regions of high importance in weapons production and to achieve political and propaganda objective of creating an Italian fascist government, formally still allied to the Third Reich. The sudden and complete collapse of the Italian state and war machine was mainly caused by the mistakes made by the political and military leadership, the unrealism of their initiatives, misunderstanding about the real consistence and objectives of the Allies by the decision of the Italian leadership to surrender to the Allies, but not to fight the Germans. The lack of clear orders to the subordinate commands, the importance given to the personal safety of the leadership and its institutional continuity, even to the detriment of the capability of resistance of the armed forces, led to the disintegration of the units, abandoned without a leader to the German attacks and reprisals despite some instances of valour and fighting spirit.  Numbers  According to German accounts, the Italian forces disarmed totaled 1,006,370. Broken down by region, they were: * 415,682 in northern Italy * 102,340 in southern Italy * 8,722 in France * 164,986 in Yugoslavia * 265,000 in mainland Greece and the Aegean islands The disarmament of such a large army resulted in the confiscation of large numbers of weapons and military-related equipment: * 1,285,871 rifles * 39,007 machine guns * 13,906 MAB 38 submachine guns * 8,736 mortars * 2,754 field guns * 5,568 other artillery pieces * 16,631 vehicles * 977 armored vehicles Only 197,000 Italian soldiers continued the war alongside the Germans. Some 94,000, mostly fascists, chose this option right away. The rest, some 103,000 men, chose during their detention to support the Italian Social Republic to escape the harsh circumstances in the German labor camps. Between 600,000 and 650,000 remained in German labor camps, where between 37,000 and 50,000 of them perished. Between 20,000 and 30,000 Italian soldiers had been killed during the fighting in September 1943, and 13,000 more had perished in the sinking of POW ships in the Aegean.

Most notable for its permanent collection of Inuit art, the Dennos Museum opened in 1991 and features rotating exhibitions of Modern and Contemporary art. The museum consists of three changing exhibit galleries, a sculpture court, an Interactive Discovery Gallery for children and adults, and the Smith Wing for Inuit Art. The museum has a permanent collection of 2,600 works, of which 1,600 are Inuit art prints and sculptures. The museum is home to three temporary exhibition galleries that cover . As a cultural center, the Dennos Museum also provides exhibitions and programs in the sciences and performing arts. It includes the Milliken Auditorium, a 367-seat concert hall that hosts an annual concert series emphasizing world, jazz and blues music along with NMC and community events. The museum oversees a collection of 14 outdoor sculptures by international and Michigan artists on the grounds of the college campus. In 2000, the museum was recognized by ArtServe Michigan with the Governor's Award for Arts and Culture.  History   Formation  The Inuit art collection was started in 1960 by Northwestern Michigan College librarian Bernie Rink, who began collecting sculptures and prints for a library exhibition fundraiser. Rink organized the event as an annual sale of Canadian Inuit Art. Many of the items sold by Rink were prints. He retained some of the items each year, both prints and sculptures, resulting in the gradual growth of the Inuit art collection to 500 pieces by 1991, and 1500 pieces by 2015. A need for an art collection and cultural center in Traverse City was identified in the 1980s. Barbara and husband Michael Dennos, then an executive with Chef Pierre (Sarah Lee Corporation), were both instrumental in the formation and funding of the museum. In 1988, founding director Eugene Jenneman was hired by Northwestern Michigan College to work with architect Bob Holdeman to design and oversee the building of the museum. After a $6.5-million community campaign, the museum, named for Michael and Barbara Dennos, was opened in July 1991. The Barbara and Michael Dennos Museum Center was one of the first collections of Inuit art open to the public in the United States. The Dennos Museum Center building, designed by Holeman, includes the Milliken Auditorium, home to a concert and lecture series, educational events and other programming. expanded Dennos Museum, 2020  Expansion  Following fundraising efforts which began in 2015, the museum received significant funds from local benefactors, including a $1 million gift from Barbara and Dudley Smith for the Inuit art gallery expansion and a $2 million gift from Diana and Richard Milock, the museum expanded its Inuit Gallery and added an additional 10,000 square feet of semi-permanent exhibition space as part of a $5 million building expansion that opened in 2018. The addition for the Inuit Collection was named the Barbara and Dudley Smith Wing for Inuit Art.  Collections  Inuit art wing of the Dennos Museum The Dennos Museum established one of the first public collections in the United States of Inuit Art of the Canadian Arctic. The majority of works in the permanent collection are from Inuit people of the Canadian Arctic, Greenland, and Alaska. The museum also holds a collection of works by Canadian artists associated with the Woodlands style including Norval Morrisseau and Carl Ray, as well as works by key Michigan contemporary artists such as Charles McGee.

Management  Adult tour at the Dennos MuseumThe museum is led by executive director Craig Hadley, former curator of the art museum at DePauw University in Indiana, who took the reins in late 2019. Hadley succeeded Eugene Jenneman, the museum's founding executive director, who was hired by the college in 1988 to help finalize the museum's design and construction and oversaw several major expansions during his 27-year tenure. Jenneman also oversaw a concert series, performed within the Dennos Museum Center's Milliken Auditorium. In 2016, this role was transferred to NMC audio engineer Jack Conners.

Overview The Awa no Tanuki festival was first started in 1978 with the aims of promoting local culture, and has since grown into Tokushima's main Autumn festival. In 2006, the event saw good weather for all three days it was held, and the coincidence with a public holiday drew over 260,000 visitors. This is roughly the same size as the population of Tokushima City. While the festival is popularly known as the 'Tanuki Festival', Tokushima has been home to many tales of the tanuki since long past. Several of these tales talk of the interaction between tanuki and the local town residents, with the tanuki often acting as positive, changing forces. It should come as no surprise, then, that the tanuki was chosen as a symbol to energise local culture in this way. At current, the event's main grounds are the Aibahama Park grounds in Tokushima City, and the Tokushima Arts Foundation for Culture becomes a place for sale of local regional produce from around the prefecture. Several of the large industries in Tokushima hold events over the three days of the festival, and special stages are open for karaoke competitions, Awa Odori, Awa Puppet Theatre and other local cultural traditions as well.

Until the currency restrictions of the late 1940s, the Canadian automotive industry's output provided a major part of British Empire countries vehicles. These territories levied reduced, Imperial preference, duties on Canadian products, usually made by Canadian subsidiaries of the big U.S. auto manufacturers. In the late 1930s, Canada started drawing up standard designs, to prepare for the beginning of the war, which involved a unique and historic design and production collaboration between rival giant car-makers Ford and GM of Canada. Canadian Military Pattern trucks not only motorized the militaries of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but were also sent to the Soviet Union following the Nazi invasion, as part of Canada's Gift and Mutual Aid program to the Allies. During the War, CMP trucks saw service around the world in the North African Campaign, the Allied invasion of Sicily, the Italian Campaign, the Soviet Front, the Burma Campaign, the Battle of the Philippines (1941‚Äì42), the liberation of Northwest Europe, and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. CMP trucks also served in post-war conflicts in Indonesia, French Indochina, and the Portuguese colonies in Africa. The United Kingdom's official History of the Second World War called Canada's war-time production of soft-skinned trucks, including the CMP class, the country's most important contribution to Allied victory. Canada's trucks are considered to have \\"..put the British Army on wheels\\" ‚Äî in the North African Campaign, the British Eighth Army fought Rommel using almost exclusively CMP trucks; and the Allied progress from Sicily, through Italy and France, depended heavily on the Canadian trucks. By war's end, Canada's vast supply of trucks provided a vehicle for every three soldiers in the field ‚Äî compared to one vehicle per seven American GIs, making it the most mobile army in the world. History The rise to power in Germany of Hitler and the Nazi party in 1933 led to discussions in the mid-1930s between the British War Office and the Canadian Army concerning the possible production of military vehicles in Canada. During the First World War Canadian land forces had participated as a corps in the British Army. In any future conflict it was assumed that Canadian forces would again be tightly integrated with those of the Mother Country, and so it would be essential that Canadian-manufactured equipment be compatible with British standards and specifications. Early in 1937, the Ford Motor Company of Canada and R. S. McLaughlin of General Motors of Canada Ltd were each invited by the Canadian Department of National Defence to produce a Canadian prototype of a 15-hundredweight (cwt), (similar to ¬æ-ton U.S.) payload rating, light infantry truck that had then been recently adopted by the British War Office.Blueprint for Victory.. By 1938, Canadian military authorities had shifted their interest to heavier 4x4 and 6x4 designs. In that year, Ford and General Motors of Canada Limited were invited to produce prototypes of a 6x4 medium artillery tractor derived from the British 6x4 Scammell Pioneer. By 1939, plans had been prepared for the mass production in Canada of a range of military vehicles based on fairly strict CMP British specifications. These trucks were originally designated \\"Department of National Defence (DND) Pattern\\"; however, when production volumes increased and it became clear that the Canadian-built vehicles were to serve widely in the forces of other countries, the class of trucks was redesignated \\"Canadian Military Pattern (CMP)\\". At the outbreak of World War II, Canada's large and modern automobile industry was shifted over to the production of military vehicles outproducing Germany. Initially intended for Canadian military use, the vehicles were soon taken on by all British and Commonwealth forces. While the Dunkirk evacuation in the spring of 1940 succeeded in rescuing close to 340,000 Allied soldiers who had been encircled by the invading German army, the British Expeditionary Force had been required to abandon most of its military vehicles in France. It then became an urgent need to replace those losses and to provide new vehicles to equip the rapidly expanding armed forces of the Commonwealth. CMP vehicles, based on the British specification and with large manufacturing capacity, were the logical answer. Production Ford F15A with opened windscreen panel on driver side Canadian factories produced around 850,000 vehicles in World War II, including some 50,000 armoured vehicles, self-propelled guns and tanks. But the greatest significance had the vast majority ‚Äì more than 800,000 units ‚Äî of trucks and light wheeled vehicles, produced by Ford, General Motors and Chrysler of Canada. Thanks to a large pre-war automotive sector, Canada's great wartime achievement was to build more military trucks than the main Axis nations ‚Äî Germany, Italy and Japan ‚Äî combined, matching the demands of mobile warfare in the age of Blitzkrieg. Canada's military truck production focused predominantly on a broad range of medium-rated vehicles ‚Äî light jeeps and trucks over 3-tons capacity, required by the Canadian Army, were purchased from outside suppliers.Blueprint for Victory.. Canadian industry production included both modified civilian / commercial designs (306,000 of which were classified as Modified Conventional Pattern, or MCP), as well as dedicated military-purpose designs, conforming to the Canadian Military Pattern specification, in roughly equal numbers. Most CMP trucks were manufactured by the Canadian Chevrolet division of General Motors, and Ford Motor Company of Canada. The two manufacturers were able to quickly ramp up their Canadian production, by utilizing their large amounts of reserve production capacity that had remained idle ever since the Great Depression, and through an unusual act of collaboration between the two rival companies, including the use of interchangeable components. A smaller number of CMP trucks were assembled from Canadian-made chassis and parts, typically first built on Canadian production lines, then broken (knocked) down, crated, and shipped overseas, and then to be re-assembled in Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (2,600), India (9,500), Italy and Egypt. Following British convention, CMP trucks had right-hand drive even though most of them were built in Canada, which primarily used left-hand drive vehicles. The CMP specification proved versatile, and it formed the basis of a wide variety of different truck types and even some armoured vehicles. Encompassing a bewildering variety, there were no less than ninety types of CMP army vehicles, on twelve different chassis, including three different types of wireless trucks, four ambulance types, and thirteen field workshop vehicles. In Australian service (almost always with the No. 13 cab), the vehicles were known as the \\"Chev Blitz\\" or the \\"Ford Blitz\\". Around 410,000 CMP trucks were manufactured in Canada, with GM contributing 201,000 and Ford making the remainder.General Motors of Canada ‚Äì US Auto Industry in World War Two The most prevalent models were 4x4, 3-ton trucks (common types were the Chevrolet C60S and C60L, and the equivalent Ford F60S and F60L), with just over 209,000 vehicles made. Additionally, Chrysler was enlisted to crank out another 180,000 Dodge trucks, just over three quarters of which were 3-ton trucks to also be used in the CMP role, although they conformed to the CMP pattern to a much lesser extent, being fitted with standard Dodge control cabins, riding on -longer wheelbases, and mostly being two-wheel drive. Furthermore, roughly 9,500 4x4 CMP chassis were made, mainly to be used to build armoured cars and other vehicles in Allied countries. Canada's production of CMP trucks alone exceeded the total military truck production of Nazi Germany. The British History of the Second World War (the United Kingdom's official account of the war) argues that the production of soft-skinned trucks, including the CMP truck class, was Canada's most important contribution to the eventual Allied victory.Hall, H. Duncan and Wrigley, C. C. Studies of Overseas Supply, a volume in the War Production Series directed by M. M. Postan, published as part of the History of the Second World War. United Kingdom Civil Series edited by Sir Keith Hancock. Her Majesty's Stationery Office and Longmans, Green and Co., London, 1956, pp. 51-52. After 1945, newly-manufactured and modified war surplus CMP trucks were used in several European armies (e.g. the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Spain), and around the world (e.g., South Africa, Argentina, Jordan, South Vietnam, Malaya). CMP trucks were adapted after the war for a variety of civilian roles including forestry, grain transport, fire-fighting, and snowploughs. In Malaysia, after the Malayan Emergency, many CMP trucks were converted to log transporters or off-road trucks in construction site with upgraded brake system and powerful engines.

An American-made GMC straight-6 engine powered the C60X 3-ton truck. The Ford and Chevrolet trucks shared a standard cab design, which evolved over the years of production. The first (designed at Ford by Sid Swallow), second and third cab designs were called No. 11, 12 and 13, respectively. The first two type were similar, the main difference being a two-part radiator grille in No.12 cab (its upper part was opened with a bonnet, which was known as the \\"Alligator cab\\"). The final No. 13 cab, an entirely Canadian design made from late 1941 until the end of the war, had the two flat panes of the windscreen angled slightly downward to minimize the glare from the sun and to avoid causing strong reflections that would be observable from aircraft. All the CMP cab designs had a short, \\"cab forward\\" configuration that gave CMP trucks their distinctive pug-nosed profile. This design was required to meet the original British specifications for a compact truck design that would be more efficient to transport by ship. The specifications also demanded right-hand drive. Internally the cab had to accommodate the comparatively large North American engines and it was generally cramped.Fletcher, David British Military Transport 1829‚Äì1956 London 1998 HMSO The standard cabs were then matched up with a variety of standard chassis, drive trains and body designs. Chevrolet-built vehicles could be recognised by the radiator grille mesh being of a diamond pattern, whereas Ford-built ones had grilles formed of a square mesh. Dodge production started later. Early prototypes used the No. 13 cab, but production vehicles retained a commercial cab and longer conventional control similar to MCP vehicles. This enabled more rapid production, while retaining similar specifications for chassis, drive, and mounting of vehicle rear bodies. The production of CMP truck bodies in Canada was subcontracted out to smaller companies in Ontario and Manitoba, organized into the wartime \\"Steel Body Manufacturers Association\\" by the Department of Munitions and Supply.Blueprint for Victory.. The dizzying variety of truck body designs included general service (GS) / troop carrier, fuel / water tanker, vehicle recovery (tow truck), field ambulance, dental clinic, mobile laundry, wireless house (radio HQ), machinery (machine shop / welding station), folding boat transport, artillery tractor, and anti-tank gun portee. Two early Chevrolet trucks ‚Äî CMP left / MCP right, 1942. In the list below, a drive specification of NxM means that the vehicle has a total of N wheels and that M of those wheels are driven. The military specifications did not permit more than two wheels per axle.This restriction could have several possible benefits. First, a standard axle length would simplify the use of standard loading ramps, partial bridge decks, and bridge decks in which the road bearing girders protrude above the road surface on the top side. Second, the load of trucks of a standard axle length is more directly and safely transmitted down to the longitudinal spans supporting the bridge under the bridge deck by positioning the spans apart to match the standard axle length. Third, allowing only one wheel at each end of an axle would ensure that all wheels would be fast to change. Finally, minimizing the tread width would very slightly reduce a vehicle's vulnerability in minefields while following other vehicles of the same standard axle length. The British standard load capacities of 8 cwt (hundredweight), 15 cwt, 30 cwt and 60 cwt correspond roughly to the American loads of 1/2 short ton, 3/4 ton, 1.5 ton and 3 ton, respectively. The 60-cwt CMP trucks were usually called 3-ton lorries or trucks.

Though popular sources on Canadian Military Pattern trucks mainly discuss the Ford and GM models, Dodge built some 180,000 trucks, most of which for use in the CMP role, and by the same naming convention ‚Äî three quarters of which were 3-ton models of various D60 (Dodge T-110) types. To achieve a quick increase in output of trucks that provided equal functionality, it was deemed acceptable for the Dodges to forgo the standardized Ford and Chevy control cabin; and like the other two automakers, Dodge equally fitted its own engines. But although regular Dodge cabs were fitted, they were right hand drive, and had a gunner's hatch in the roof. After initial D60s had been produced with 8.25x20 tires and dual rear wheels, they were subsequently switched over to the larger, CMP specification 10.50x16 size, and axles with single rear wheels, as well as being fitted with British design rear bodies. Operator's and technical manuals for the Dodges also mirrored the Ford and GM CMP manuals. This notwithstanding, all of Dodge's models were two-wheel drive, with a high and low-range rear axle. All Dodges were powered by Chrysler's straight-six flathead gasoline engines ‚Äî the 3-ton D60 models' delivered 95 HP @ 3600 rpm. *Dodge D8A (8cwt, or ¬Ω-ton ‚Äì engineering code T-212) *Dodge D15 (15cwt, or ¬æ-ton ‚Äì engineering code T-222) *Dodge D60S (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110L-6, with a short 136\\" wheelbase) *Dodge D60S/DD (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110L-13, with a short 136\\" wheelbase) *Dodge D60L (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110L-5, with a long 160\\" wheelbase) *Dodge D60L/D (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110L-9, with a long 160\\" wheelbase) *Dodge D60L/DD (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110L-12, with a long 160\\" wheelbase) The initial 60cwt, or 3-ton Dodge types: the T110L-S, T110L-3, T110L-4, as well as the later T110L-14 didn't formally carry a D60 nomenclature. Outside Canada Chassis and vehicle production was licensed to Australia, allowing local production, while other vehicles were shipped to Britain in part-assembled \\"knocked down\\" form. These were delivered as kits, and had final assembly in factories in Britain. Air portable versions had the top half of the cab superstructure and exterior components stowed to allow the vehicles to fit in the hold of transport aircraft, which could easily be re-fitted on receipt in theatre. Bare chassis were created for alternative bodies to be fitted, reducing the shipping requirement to India. Bodies for these vehicles were locally produced in India from available materials, frequently built entirely from wood, creating a diverse range of \\"Indian Pattern\\" vehicles. To meet the pressing demand for military vehicles during World War II, several Commonwealth countries designed light armoured vehicles based on CMP chassis made in Canada. Special chassis were created to aid in this purpose, featuring rear mounted engines and central steering positions. Armoured cars used these or standard chassis depending on design and availability. *Ruskin Motor Bodies Pty Ltd and Ford Motor Company of Australia Rover Light Armoured Car (4x4, 134.25-inch and 158.25-inch wheelbases) - built on Ford 3-ton CMP chassis *General Motors Holden Ltd Rhino Heavy Armoured Car (4x4, 101-inch wheelbase) - prototype only *General Motors Holden Ltd 6x6 Heavy Armoured Car (6x6, 158-inch wheelbase) *Indian Railways Armoured Carrier Wheeled Indian Pattern (ACV-IP) (4x4, 101\\"? wheelbase) - most used CMP chassis *South African Reconnaissance Car, also called the Marmon-Herrington Armoured Car (4x4, various wheelbases) *Beaverette NZ, the New Zealand version of the British Standard Beaverette armoured car *C8AX \\"Puddlejumper\\" (4x4, 101-inch wheelbase, 8 cwt), variant created in New Zealand based on the C8A chassis A number of Indian Pattern vehicles also had armoured bodies built, creating armoured trucks.

As a professor at Cooper's Hill, he influenced colonial forestry across the British colonies. His major work was a five volume Manual of Forestry (1889-96). Biography Schlich, in the middle of the seated row, with students from the forestry school at Oxford, on a visit to the forests of Saxony in 1892 William was born to Daniel Schlich and Charlotte Frank. Both parents came from Hessian families and Daniel was a Lutheran pastor or Kirchenrat. His early education was at Flonheim and then at Langg√∂ns and other schools in Hesse where the family moved. Schlich attended the Gymnasium in Darmstadt (1851). In 1855, he entered the University of Giessen, where he studied under Gustav Heyer (1826-1883). Graduating in 1862, he joined the Hesse forestry service and was appointed Oberforster in Homberg in 1865. He received a doctoral degree in 1867 from Giessen. The Austro- Prussian War of 1866 forced him to move, and, on Heyer's recommendation he entered the British Imperial Indian Forest Service. Arriving in India in February 1867 his first posting was in Burma. He was promoted and worked in Sind and later Bengal, becoming Conservator of Forests in 1871, and Inspector- General of Forests in 1883, succeeding his mentor Dietrich Brandis. He developed forest management and education programmes and spent 19 years in India, helping to establish the journal Indian Forester in 1874 (becoming its first honorary editor) and the school at Dehradun in 1877. In 1885 Schlich moved to England to take up the pioneering post of Professor of Forestry at the Royal Indian Engineering College at Cooper's Hill, near Egham, Surrey, the first formal forestry course in England. He became a British citizen in 1886. In 1905, upon the closure of the college at Cooper's Hill, he moved to Oxford, to found Oxford's forestry programme.Burley, Jeffery, et al. 2009. \\"A History of Forestry at Oxford\\", British Scholar, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 236-61; accessed 6 May 2012. He retired on 1 January 1920 and lived on at Oxford where he died on 28 September 1925 from a bronchial infection. He is buried at Wolvercote. Schlich was a colleague and mentor of Gifford Pinchot. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1901, awarded the Knight Commander of the Indian Empire in 1909 and was an Honorary Fellow of St John's College. Works Schlich was the author of the five-volume Manual of Forestry (1889‚Äì96) published serially in three editions. The first two volumes were on silviculture, the others dealing with forest management, forest protection, and forest utilisation. His Manual became the standard and enduring textbook for forestry students. In 1904 he published Forestry in the United Kingdom. Other publications were The Outlook of the World's Timber Supply and Afforestation in Great Britain and Ireland. Personal life Schlich married Mary Margaret Smith in 1874. She was English, the daughter of the lexicographer Sir William Smith. In 1874 he changed the spelling of his name from Wilhelm to William. The marriage produced one son who died early and one daughter, Gertrude. Following the death of his first wife in 1878, he married Ad√®le Emilie Mathilde Marsily, member of an Antwerp family originally from Italy. They had a son and three daughters. He is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford. The composer Humphrey Searle was his grandson.

Throughout his career, he has worked extensively with economist Samuel Bowles. Their landmark book, Schooling in Capitalist America, has had multiple editions in five languages since it was first published in 1976. Their most recent book, A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and its Evolution was published by Princeton University Press in 2011. Life and career Gintis was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where his father had a retail furniture business. He grew up there and later in Bala Cynwyd (just outside Philadelphia). Gintis completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Pennsylvania in three years, one of which was spent at the University of Paris, and received his B.A. in mathematics in 1961. He then enrolled at Harvard University for post-graduate work in mathematics. After receiving his M.A. in 1962, he grew disillusioned with the subject area, and although still registered at Harvard, became a sandal maker with a shop in Harvard Square. During that time, he became very active in the student movements of the 1960s, including the Students for a Democratic Society and grew increasingly interested in Marxism and economics. In 1963, he switched his PhD program at Harvard from mathematics to economics, completing his PhD in 1969 with his dissertation, Alienation and power: towards a radical welfare economics. He was subsequently hired as an assistant professor in the Harvard Graduate School of Education and then as an assistant professor and later associate professor in Harvard's Economics Department.Alberto, Carlos Torres (2013), Education, Power, and Personal Biography: Dialogues With Critical Educators, pp. 107‚Äì129. Routledge. Towards the end of his postgraduate studies in economics, Gintis had come into contact with the economist Samuel Bowles who had returned to Harvard after research work in Nigeria. It was to be the beginning of a collaboration that has lasted throughout their careers. In 1968 Gintis and Bowles were part of a group of graduate students and young faculty members at Harvard that included Michael Reich, Richard Edwards, Stephen Marglin, and Patricia Quick. The group held seminars to develop their ideas on a new economics that would encompass issues of alienation of labor, racism, sexism, and imperialism. Many of their ideas were tried out in a Harvard class which they collectively taught, \\"The Capitalist Economy: Conflict and Power\\". They also became founding members of the Union of Radical Political Economists.Lee, Frederic (2009). A History of Heterodox Economics: Challenging the Mainstream in the Twentieth Century, p. 271. Routledge. In 1974 Gintis, along with Bowles, Stephen Resnick, Richard D. Wolff and Richard Edwards, was hired by the Economics Department at the University of Massachusetts Amherst as part of the \\"radical package\\" of economists.Katzner, Donald W. (2011).

The Neo-Classical building, located adjacent to Oxnard's Plaza Park, opened in 1907 as the Oxnard Public Library and was converted into an art museum in 1986. In July 1971, it became the first building in Ventura County and the first Carnegie library in California to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2019 the city considered laying off the employees at the museum and at the Oxnard Performing Arts Center and shuttering both facilities. Construction and early history Downtown Oxnard in 1908, Oxnard Public Library on the right In late 1904, Oxnard's first mayor Richard B. Haydock wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie soliciting a donation to build a library in Oxnard. In February 1906, Carnegie offered to donate $10,000 toward the construction of a library if the City of Oxnard would furnish the site and agree to provide at least $1,000 per year to maintain it. By September 1906, construction was underway. Mayor Haydock selected the Greek Neo-Classical architecture with Doric columns for the new library, which was designed by Los Angeles architect Franklin Burnham.Hudak, Tracy (2012-06-08) \\"My Own Private Museum: A Closer Look at Oxnard's Carnegie Art Museum\\" KCET Artbound Carnegie initially gave $10,000 toward construction of the library, but as the plans were drawn, the city decided to build a more expensive building that could also house the city's municipal offices and city hall. In July 1906, the city signed a contract with Thomas Carroll for $14,000 to build the dual-use facility. Carnegie agreed to pay half of the additional appropriation in addition to the original $10,000 gift. The final cost was $14,000 with Carnegie contributing $12,000 and the city contributing $2,000. The main floor was occupied by the library, and the basement was Oxnard's city hall. The library was opened on May 16, 1907. Five years later, Oxnard's library had \\"the largest circulation of any city of the sixth class in the State.\\" In 1923, the library was expanded with the opening of a new three-story addition on the east side of the building, allowing the library to expand its holdings to 20,000 books. The structure continued to serve as Oxnard's city hall until 1949 and as the Oxnard Public Library until 1963.Lindell, Karen (2012-10-14) \\"Carnegie Art Museum in Oxnard celebrates 25th anniversary\\" Ventura County Star Later uses In March 1963, the Oxnard Public Library moved to a new location, and the building was used between 1963 and 1975 by the Oxnard Convention and Visitors Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce. It also served as a facade for the \\"Dan August\\" television show starring Burt Reynolds in the early 1970s. Two of the structure's three neoclassical facades In 1977, the city received a $133,000 federal grant to restore the building, which re- opened on August 16, 1980 as the Carnegie Cultural Arts Center, which was the home of the Art Club of Oxnard, the Oxnard Historical Society Museum and the audiovisual portion of the Oxnard Public Library. In 1986, the building became the Carnegie Art Museum, owned and operated by the City of Oxnard. The museum had 37,000 visitors in 2002. It has hosted exhibitions by Southern California artists, including Michael Dvortcsak, Joyce Trieman, Frank Romero and Gronk. The Museum also has a permanent collection of more than 1,500 art and ethnographic objects, including over 600 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs primarily by 20th century California artists such as Arthur Beaumont, Colin Campbell Cooper, Millard Sheets, and Leo Politi. Historic designation In February 1971, the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board listed the building as a heritage landmark. In July 1971, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, becoming the first site so designated in Ventura County.

It contains a mixture of docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, phospholipids, choline, uridine monophosphate, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol equivalents), selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, and folic acid; this mixture is branded as Fortasyn Connect. As of 2017, the product had failed to show a significant effect in decreasing the rate of cognitive decline or delaying progression of Alzheimer's disease, but appeared to cause minor improvement in verbal memory in some people in the very early stages of the disease. The clinical trials that had been conducted were in people with very early Alzheimer's disease and excluded people who ate recommended amounts of food that included fish oil. Souvenaid was originally created by the Dutch company Numico Research, which was acquired by Danone (Dannon in the US) in 2007 and is marketed by Nutricia, a division of Danone. The product is based in part on basic research work done by Richard Wurtman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and MIT and Harvard patented the mixture and licensed the patent to the company. The theory behind the ingredients included in Souvenaid is that they are components or precursors to components of synaptic membranes, the theory that problems with synapse formation are part of the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and the idea that these problems might be caused or exacerbated by a lack of those components in the diets of people who develop Alzheimer's disease. As of 2013 it was marketed through pharmacies in Brazil, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Australia. In the UK pharmacists have to undergo a training course and take an online test from the manufacturer before they can sell it. In January 2014, the French regulatory authorities rejected the manufacturer's proposed marketing claims on the basis that target population and its nutritional needs were not well defined and the statistically weak data in the evidence provided.

The park is mostly known at the national level from the Baneheia case as the scene of a notorious murder of two girls ages 8 and 10 that took place in 2000. The area lies just north of the centre of the city of Kristiansand and it has hills, lakes, and forest. The Ravnedalen Park lies just to the northwest of Baneheia.

Baneheia is used for hiking or jogging during spring, summer, and autumn and can be used for skiing during winter if there's enough snow. In Baneheia occur many different species of birds. There are also lighted trails. Some parts of the area are even accessible by wheelchair users.  History  Baneheia used to be quite a sad view, as the trees were gone because of the inhabitants' need of wood. In the 1800s, general Joseph Frantz Oscar Wergeland used soldiers from the city's garrison to plant trees, build stairs, trails, etc. and made Baneheia into what it is today. Baneheia murders The area is also known for the infamous double murder incident which occurred in May 2000. Two young girls were raped and murdered close by the '3.

The victims were two girls, 10-year-old Lena Sl√∏gedal Paulsen (born 14 May 1990) and 8-year-old Stine Sofie S√∏rstr√∏nen (born 10 May 1992). They were found raped and killed in the Baneheia area in Kristiansand. Two persons were convicted and sentenced for the murders in 2002: Viggo Kristiansen (born 24 May 1979) and Jan Helge Andersen (born 17 January 1981). The case received massive media attention in Norway in the early 2000s,The Baneheia Sentence (RG-2002-751) ‚Äì full text and also attracted attention abroad. Kristiansen was convicted of both murders and of raping both girls, and sentenced to 21 years of containment, equivalent to a life sentence. Andersen was convicted of the murder of S√∏rstr√∏nen, but acquitted of the murder of Paulsen. He was also convicted of raping both girls, and sentenced to 19 years in prison. The conviction of Viggo Kristiansen was based on indirect circumstantial evidence and a testimony by Jan Helge Andersen. The testimony was extracted with the use of suggestive questioning. Technical evidence from Viggo Kristiansen's phone provides him with a reasonably certain alibi at the time of murder. Kristiansen applied for a retrial several times, but his applications were rejected .  The events on 19 May  Stine-Sofie S√∏rstr√∏nen lived in the town of Grimstad while Lena Sl√∏gedal Paulsen lived in a different neighborhood within the city of Kristiansand. On the day of the murders, 19 May 2000, they were visiting with their fathers who both lived in the same block of flats within the residential area of Grim. In the evening, they were going swimming together at a small lake called \\"Stampe 3.\\" in the popular recreation area of Baneheia, which was not very far. They left home at approximately between 18:15 and 18:20. Two college students who also happened to be swimming at the same time as the girls, testified that they were still in the water when they left at approximately 18:50.  The murders according to the verdict  On their way home from the lake, the girls ran into the two assailants, Viggo Kristiansen and Jan Helge Andersen, who had been bicycling around the area looking for potential victims. They were lured by Kristiansen, who pretended to be looking for lost kittens, up to a more secluded part of the terrain. At the trial, the court established that both girls were at this point first ordered to undress, then sexually assaulted by Kristiansen. Andersen contributed to this act by subduing the girls, as well as later sexually molesting S√∏rstr√∏nen. After Kristiansen had raped Sl√∏gedal Paulsen, he killed her by stabbing her three times, once in the abdomen/chest and two times in the neck, severing her right carotid artery. After briefly arguing over who was going to kill the remaining child, Andersen proceeded to stab S√∏rstr√∏nen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding her arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before hiding the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in a nearby muddy drainage pipe. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was to say he was in his workshop, while Andersen was to say he was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi. Search When the two girls had not returned home by 23:00, the parents reported them missing, and a major search operation was launched. Immediately, police together with canine units began searching the area. By the next morning, over 50 volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross were participating in the search. This number soon swelled to the hundreds, as Sea King and special police helicopters were called in along with rescue divers and civilian divers who trawled the lakes and ponds in the area. Volunteer mountaineers also climbed the steep cliffs bordering Baneheia, while the fire department surveyed the shorelines. On Saturday night 16 electronic listening posts were set up around the terrain, which could detect extremely low volume noise during the night. This was done in case the girls were lying injured somewhere in the hills, in which case even the most faint crying or sulking would have been easily detected. Search-and-rescue teams combing the area Two days after the disappearance, the police expanded the search to include all of the woodlands and lakes adjacent to Kristiansand, collectively known as \\"Bymarka\\". Authorities also mobilized the military in the efforts to locate the missing children, with hundreds of troops from the Home guard joining in, canvassing gardens, garages, boats, sheds, hedges and kindergartens. Helicopters applied heat-seeking cameras, all tunnels in connection with road construction in Baneheia were scanned, and all buses, ferries, trains and taxis were checked by armed police, but gave no clue as to the whereabouts of the girls. Two days after the disappearance, police announced the discovery of a human skeleton near the river Otra, outside of Baneheia, but quickly declared it to be a missing German tourist, unrelated to the case. on the evening on the same day, police cordoned off a large area by the lake known as \\"2. Stampe\\". Police later that evening declared that both girls had been found murdered at that site. Upon receiving the news, the reaction among the hundreds of search-and-rescue personnel on site was one of enormous grief, many breaking down and weeping inconsolably, others walking around in a state of shock. The bodies of the two little girls were found hidden under pine branches in a small slab rock crack a few dozen meters west of the pond, which is one of several ponds that constitutes a much frequented bathing area for the populace in Kristiansand. Traces of blood were also found across the scene along with the girls' clothes and shoes. They had been sexually assaulted, tied-up, strangled and stabbed to death. Investigation Early investigation After the discovery of the bodies, the police opened a murder investigation. Despite having received about 150 tips in the case, they were practically without leads. Kristiansand Police however stated that they were \\"optimistic and confident that this case, we will be able to resolve fairly quickly\\". Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Minister of Justice Hanne Harlem both stated that everything would be done to get the murders solved. On a normal Friday night there tended to be around 200 people jogging and strolling around in Baneheia. On the night of the crime, approximately 100 people were either jogging or walking through the area. A fixed abode for recreational drug users that for years had been colloquially referred to as \\"acid peak\\" was only 200 meters from the place where the two little girls were found murdered. Police interviewed large numbers of individuals known to frequent the area in order to learn of any possible witnesses. The area was also formerly known as a place where exhibitionists and voyeurs have operated. Dagbladets front page reads: Unbelievable, which sick Satan could have done this? Other possible suspects that were questioned by police included former sex-offenders, local convicted rapists, convicted murderers and even two psychiatric patients who had escaped from a psychiatric institution adjacent to the area. Similar crimes, such as the murder of a 13-year-old girl in Sweden were matched along with the brutal rape of two young girls in Oslo in the case of an eventual serial-offender. Even cases of child-murders in England were re-examined. Friends of the victims told police investigators that the two girls had previously experienced a mysterious man following them during a swimming trip. Police initially theorized that the same man was the murderer. The acting chief of the Criminal Investigation Service (Kripos) H√•kon Skulstad stated that worst-case scenario was a travelling perpetrator who was just passing through the area, just as Norway had experienced many years earlier in the case of Thomas Quick However professor and leading forensic psychiatrist Berthold Gr√ºnfeld stated that this was unlikely. According to him, the murderer was most likely a man, in his 30s and without prior criminal record. This was echoed by expert forensic psychiatrist Kjell Noreik who added that the perpetrator most likely was without any serious mental illness, and was \\"aware of his actions\\". In May 2000, the local police said their main theory was that they were most likely facing two perpetrators, who had meticulously planned the murders in advance, due to the difficulties a single perpetrator would face in controlling both girls. As he attacked one, the other would have an opportunity to escape. In Baneheia, people are always close by, and there are plenty of hiding places among the pine thickets and rocks. The odds were good that a lone assailant would fail. In June 2000, Kripos composed a profile for the killer, and their theory was that it only was one perpetrator. The police were also searching for five unidentified people who behaved suspiciously near Baneheia. Arrests During the early investigation, the local police wanted to arrest both Andersen and Kristiansen, but they were stopped by Kripos (who had come to assist the local police). The reason for stopping the arrests was that there were no evidence on either Andersen or Kristiansen at that time.https://viggokristiansen.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/brev-statsadvokaten- i-agder-sladdet.pdf But when checking the DNA found on the crime scene, there was a match on Andersen. On September 13, after keeping him under surveillance for 48-hours, they arrested 19-year-old Jan Helge Andersen and charged him with the double murder. According to police, Andersen's DNA was a perfect match with pubic hairs found on the scene. He had no criminal record. Kristiansen was arrested at the same time as Andersen although they still didn't have any evidence on Kristiansen. Upon his arrest, Andersen initially denied having anything to do with the murders, even when confronted with DNA evidence. Moments later, when lead interrogator Geir Hansen suggested that Andersen himself could be a victim in the case, and that Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant, Andersen admitted that he murdered one of the girls. He also named 21-year-old Viggo Kristiansen as murderer of the other girl.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/barnedrapene-i- baneheia/fakta-om-baneheia-drapene/a/9668146/ The two suspects were close friends and had been seen by witnesses near the crime scene on the day of the murders. Andersen explained that the two men had plotted to commit rape and murder in detail for some time, and had bicycled around in Baneheia on the day of the murder looking for random victims when they spotted the two girls swimming. After luring the girls into the woods by claiming to have kittens, Andersen said that he acted as lookout while Kristiansen raped the two girls, and that he was forced to kill Sl√∏gedal Paulsen after fearing she would scream. Kristiansen then stabbed S√∏rstr√∏nen to death when she tried to escape. He said Kristiansen was the dominant one, and that it was he who gave the orders, which he felt compelled to follow, as he was intimidated by Kristiansen. According to Andersen, Kristiansen threatened to kill him and as well as the girls if he did not comply. Kristiansen however, vehemently denied having anything to do with the murders. Both men were subject to evaluation by court appointed psychiatrists, and both men were subsequently declared to be legally sane and fit to stand trial. On 28 September, Kristiansen was evacuated to a prison outside the city after an internet-organized vigilante mob started gathering on the street outside the courthouse. On the same day, the Kristiansand Police Commissioner Ansten Klev, publicly appealed for people to remain calm throughout the city. Trial On 23 April 2001 the trial against Andersen and Kristiansen began. By order of Prosecutor-General Tor- Aksel Busch, both men were charged with identical crimes of rape and premeditated murder. In addition, and unrelated to the murders, Kristiansen was charged with rape and sexual abuse against a girl under the age of 10, indecent assault against a boy under the age of 10, and for looking at a woman through her window while she was getting undressed. Kristiansen confessed (in full tears) that he had sexually abused the girl 5 times when he was 15‚Äì16 years old.https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/barnedrapene-i-baneheia/viggo- broet-sammen-i- graat/a/2872584/https://web.archive.org/web/20090601024959/http://tux1.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/d206502.htm Kristiansen also confessed to the charges of the woman, but not for the charges of the boy. In the end, Kristiansen was found not guilty to the charges of the boy. Kristiansen pleaded not guilty to the charge of two counts of premeditated murder and rape. Andersen pleaded guilty to one count of rape and one count of 2nd-degree murder. The court heard 49 witnesses, 30 for the prosecution and 19 for the two defendants. During her testimony, Kristiansens mother described his childhood as one with a lot of tantrums and rage. In elementary school he would frequently get into fights, as well as having verbal outbursts with his teachers. The mother said his hot temper made him a target for the older children to pick on, and during the eight grade he had enough. He would leave home for school in the morning like usual, but it turned out later that he had not been in school for half a year. He dropped out of school altogether in the ninth grade, and was since then involved with child psychiatric services. During the trial, prosecutor Edward Dahl painted Viggo Kristiansen as an extremely violent psychopath who was obsessed with pornography and rape. Psychiatrists testifying for the prosecution concluded that \\"he would no doubt have insufficiently developed mental faculties if he was found guilty\\", and a community worker described Viggo Kristiansen as a \\"ticking time-bomb\\" based on his gut feeling. The prosecutor also cast serious doubts on the veracity of Jan Helge Andersen's version of events. Amongst other things, Andersen had no explanation for why the girls were wearing each other's clothes when they were found. Furthermore, Andersen had changed his story several times during interrogation, and only when confronted with evidence had he admitted to the molesting the girls, as well as covering the bodies with pine branches. He never showed any signs of remorse, seeing himself as another victim of his co-defendant. Court psychiatrists noted his striking tendency to blame every aspect of the crime on Kristiansen, but could not agree on a definite diagnosis. In the end, it was Andersen's statement which was the main pillar in the verdict against Kristiansen. Verdict Viggo Kristiansen was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to 21 years imprisonment (containment, equivalent to a life-sentence). Jan Helge Andersen was found guilty of one count of murder and rape, and sentenced to 19 years in prison According to the verdict, Viggo Kristiansen was the leading force behind the crime. The court established that Kristiansen and Andersen both had \\"subnormal\\" IQ of 83 and 84 respectively, that Kristiansen \\"is to be considered dangerous\\", has \\"paedophile tendencies\\", \\"small or no possibility of improvement\\" and that it is \\"a reasonable danger that he might again commit violent acts and sexual abuse\\". The presiding judge Asbj√∏rn Nes Hansen wrote in his sentencing : \\"Each of the victims has been subjected to the extreme burden of having been forced to listen to the other being raped while moaning in pain. Lena must have had thoughts about what would happen to her while Stine Sofie was being raped. After Lena was killed, Stine Sofie must have heard the defendants quarreling about who was going to kill her. Jan Helge Andersen explained that Stine Sofie took Lena's arm and later peered onto her. She probably understood at that time that Lena was dead. As the District Court has referred in its judgment, it is not possible to comprehend the fear and the suffering that the two girls went through before they finally died.\\" Immediately after the sentencing inside the courtroom, news channel Tv2 recorded Kristiansen reaction while he had a grin on his face while chewing chewing-gum. They later aired the video-tape during the evening news, after Kristiansens lawyer told the media that Kristiansen had been \\"absolutely devastated\\" by the verdict. In a 2008 interview, Kristiansen explained his reaction, saying that he was smiling at the mere \\"absurdity of the situation\\", he also accused the media of using the clip to portray him as a \\"cold-blooded monster without emotions\\". This incident sparked a long legal conflict between Tv2 and the court, due to a law, banning recording of defendants inside court- rooms. Tv2 was eventually cleared of any wrongdoing. Viggo Kristiansen was not given an ordinary prison sentence, but rather sentenced to containment (the Norwegian legal term is forvaring), a form of special protective custody which means he may be held in prison indefinitely and is subject to release only at the discretion of a judge after his sentence is served. Containment is roughly comparable to a life sentence in many other European countries. Kristiansen is serving his sentence at Ila Prison, while Andersen was serving his sentence at Telemark Prison in Skien up until 2012, when he was transferred to a minimum security prison, in order to better prepare him for his eventual release on parole, possible from April 2013. Andersen was released January 2015. He has since settled in the city of T√∏nsberg.  Controversies  Two independent telecommunication companies have confirmed that Viggo Kristiansen has a technical alibi, https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/hadde-ikke-tid-til- drap/65716027 http://www.tv2.no/a/9424565 one witness testified that Kristiansen was at home during the time of the murders, https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/x4rgn/Familien-tror-Kristiansen-er- uskyldig-domthttps://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/barnedrapene-i- baneheia/toeft-aa-vaere-far-til-en-av-norges-mest-forhatte- menn/a/525702/https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/jeg-tror-at-gutten-er- uskyldig/66517518 another witness told the police that he saw Andersen alone with the girls, and a number of circumstantial evidence indicate that Kristiansen is innocent. https://viggokristiansen.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/brev-til-agder- statsadvokatembete/ The only evidence tying Viggo Kristiansen to the crime was Andersen's testimony, which was seen as questionable and weak in addition to being raised by someone who had a motive to blame someone else. Viggo Kristiansen himself has always maintained that he had no involvement in the murders, and , is refusing to apply for parole. He said that it \\"would be a sordid way to go forward\\", and \\"applying for a parole would mean accepting the current sentence a little bit\\". This means that Kristiansen can only be released from prison by being acquitted in a new trial or the charges are dropped.  Suggestive interrogation of Andersen  During initial interrogation without a lawyer, the police used suggestive question techniques to introduce Andersen to the idea that Viggo Kristiansen was a participant and even the leading force of the crime. The interrogator wrote the following in the police report: \\"I explained for Andersen that the police now knew he was one of the perpetrators. I also told Andersen about the advantages he would get by explaining everything\\", and furthermore: \\"I asked Andersen if he himself could be a victim in some sense since his best buddy Viggo Kristiansen could have been the most active participant. When I said this, it was obvious that Andersen got something to think about. We talked a little bit back and forth about the relationship between Andersen and Kristiansen, and there was no doubt that Kristiansen was the strong one, the one in charge\\". Gregg McCrary from the FBI testified in court in 2011 and said the following about this interrogation: \\"It's a very alarming way to interrogate a witness. The police must never give the name of possible perpetrators or ask leading questions\\". McCrary also said that it seemed obvious that Andersen had been guided since the details changed from interrogation to interrogation. G√≠sli Gu√∞j√≥nsson, Professor of Forensic Psychology at King's College London who is also an expert on suggestibility and false confessions, wrote in his report that the initial police interrogator \\"most likely ruined the case\\".  Telecommunication alibi  Representatives from Telenor and Teleplan testified that Kristiansen's phone could not have been in the vicinity at the time of the murders. This gave Kristiansen an alibi since he was using the phone several times. Telenor found six cell sites covering the area of the crime, but Kristiansen's phone was not connected to any of these. Instead, Kristiansen's phone was exclusively connected to a cell site called \\"EG_A\\", a cell site Telenor was unable to make contact with even with the other cell sites disconnected. Even the police tried for days to make contact with \\"EG_A\\", but without succeeding. Furthermore, since cell phones always connect to the strongest cell site, and cell phones rescan quite frequently to be sure they are continuously connected to the strongest cell site, it was clear, even if \\"EG_A\\" against all odds had coverage at that particular time, that Kristiansen could not have been near the crime site. While the report from Telenor stated that Kristiansen had an alibi without reservations, the report from Teleplan opened up \\"a small possibility that the cell site connected to Kristiansen's mobile phone could reach the crime area under extraordinary circumstances\\". The report from Teleplan was only presented in the second trial, and the exception was included in the report due to uncertainty since the conditions had changed since the time of the crime. (Telenor had done their measurements before the conditions had changed.) When sources in the police spread the word that \\"a new report had destroyed Kristiansen's cell phone alibi\\", Telenor decided to perform additional measurements, but they got the same results as they got the first time. Nonetheless, the alibi was \\"roughly dismissed\\" by the judges in the first trial, and in the second trial, the judge said that \\"the telecommunication evidence must be weighted against all other evidence\\". A senior consultant from Teleplan, Inge Sch√∏yen, later said that the court had misunderstood the report if any part of it had been used to convict Kristiansen. A 30-page report from 2016 written by the experienced telecommunication engineer Halvard Sivertsen, confirmed the measurements presented in the trials as correct, but described Teleplan's note that there was a small possibility of Kristiansen's cell site to cover the crime area as unfounded. Sivertsen also described how the report from Teleplan was presented in court and how it could have been misinterpreted there. The report from Sivertsen concluded by saying that \\"the cell phone data seems to give Kristansen a clear alibi for the timeframe of the murders\\".  Witness alibies  Kristiansen's mother testified during the trial that she saw her son arriving and walking in the backyard on the evening of the murders, and as such could not have been at the murder-site. This statement also matched the measurements in the telecommunication reports since the cell cite connected to Kristiansen's phone was close to his home, a fact Kristiansen's mother couldn't have known about since the cell phone alibi wasn't discovered until the trial was almost over.https://viggokristiansen.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/les-den-nye-sakkyndige- rapport-som-utelukker-viggo-kristiansen-fra-astedet-her/ Furthermore, a witness saw a man together with two girls between 19.40 and 19.45. The description he gave matched Andersen and the victims. Despite extensive public outreach for everyone who was in the area to contact the police, no other people matched this description. This witness, a commercial airline pilot, was not called as witness to the trials. Additional 5 people heard or saw relevant activity that also positioned the time of murders to happen between 20.00 and 20.30. At this time, Viggo Kristiansen was talking in the telephone. None of these 5 witnesses were called to the court either.http://www.99999.no/sjodin.pdf  Small likelihood of two perpetrators  There has never been a record of two adult perpetrators where children have been murdered, neither in Europe nor the United States, and an American survey from 2008 said that only 2% of all types of murder cases had more than one perpetrator. A suspect profile report created by the National Criminal Investigation Service in Norway (Kripos) concluded that there was only one perpetrator since both victims were killed in a way that could not be copied by another person. In the interrogations with the police, Jan Helge Andersen had described in detail how the girls were killed, a method he had learned by watching a special type of documentary called \\"Reality TV\\", but he was only sentenced for killing one of the victims while Kristiansen was sentenced for killing both. According to Kristiansen's lawyer, Arvid Sj√∏din, Andersen also told the police that he had never talked about this method with Kristiansen.https://viggokristiansen.wordpress.com/2017/07/06/ny-begjaering- om-gjenapning-av-baneheiasaken-levert-til-gjenopptakelseskommisjonen/ (The interrogation transcripts are not publicly available.) The suspect profile report was neither presented for the court, nor for the lawyers. It was not known for the public until 2010 when Kristiansen's lawyer Sigurd J. Kloms√¶t got hold of it by appearing personally at Kripos after several failed written requests. FBI expert Gregg McCrary agreed with the conclusion of the report.  False DNA evidence presented in court  The court of the two trials had been informed that there existed two sets of DNA profiles from the crime area, one profile that matched Jan Helge Andersen, and another profile that matched 54% of the Norwegian male population, including Viggo Kristiansen. The criminal investigation chief in Kristansand, Arne Pedersen, said that the DNA material, with \\"100% certainty\\", tied Viggo Kristiansen to the murders after consulting with Bente Mev√•g from the forensics institute.https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/dna-eksperter-ler-av-norsk-politi- i-baneheia-saken/65072968 Kristiansens lawyer tried to create doubt about whether the DNA evidence showed two perpetrators. He argued that the material could be polluted and that the evidence by itself was very uncertain, but got no positive response from Bente Mev√•g when she was confronted with this in court. In 2010, three independent laboratories in Sweden, Norway, and England retested the original biological samples stored at Santiago de Compostela- institute in Spain and the Forensic institute in Norway, material that had been reported dispatched both by Bente Mev√•g, and Arne Pedersen at the local police.https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/fant-baneheia-bevis-i- fryseren/65093041https://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/barnedrapene-i- baneheia/bevisene-i-baneheia-saken-forsvunnet/a/576693/ All laboratories reported the same result. The samples had positive DNA-profile from Jan Helge Andersen, but no match from Kristiansen. The second DNA profile, the one in the original report that matched half the Norwegian population, was this time either not reported, or reported to be a contamination, and in addition so small that it would be illegal to present in court in other countries. Dr. Susan Pope from the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in London believed the prosecutors had received an erroneous translation of the report since the second match was presented as \\"incriminating evidence\\" in court, and the Santiago de Compostela institute in Spain had denied that their report described the second match as incriminating evidence. Furthermore, according to Bj√∏rn Olav Jahr's book from 2017, the Santiago de Compostela-institute had reported tiny DNA traces from four different people, and not two people, as claimed by the Norwegian forensics institute. State prosecutor Jostein Johannesen wrote in 2010 that \\"it's unfortunate that the police presented this as incriminating evidence against Viggo Kristiansen\\". In a trial from 2011, Gregg McCrary from the FBI testified that the lack of DNA trace excludes Viggo Kristiansen even as a suspect. In the same trial, the director of FSS, Chris Hadkiss, said that the case would have been reopened in England, based on the DNA evidence alone. Susan Pope said the same.https://web.archive.org/web/20131206024745/https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/110902/ville- vaert-gjenopptatt-i-england In conjunction with an application to reopen the case in 2017, telecommunication engineer and scientist Harald Sivertsen analyzed the original report from the Santiago de Compostela-institute. Harald Sivertsen found that the report from Santiago de Compostela-institute was only meant to be a preliminary report. He also wrote that the report did not describe any certainty of two assailants, and he asked where the final report is, and what the final report says. This analysis was written in the form of a letter addressed to Bente Mev√•g, but Bente Mev√•g did not reply to the letter.https://viggokristiansen.wordpress.com/2018/01/23/sensajonell-analyse- av-dna-beviset-i-baneheiasaken-underbygger-kravet-om-gjenopptakelse/  Media portrayal  Viggo Kristiansen was consistently portrayed in the media as a cold-hearted psychopath. The local newspaper F√¶drelandsvennen referred to him as \\"the Incarnation of Evil\\". But when Andersen in court described how Andersen had killed S√∏rstr√∏nen, Kristiansen reportedly had tears in his eyes and took deep breaths, showing similar reactions as many others in the court audience. And when Kristiansen gave his testimony in court about the underaged girl he had sexually abused 6‚Äì7 years earlier, he was crying so heavily that he was unable to speak, forcing the prosecutor to read out loud Kristiansen's written police testimony instead. Kristiansen has also showed sympathy and understanding for the family members of the victims when they don't want the trial to be re-opened.https://www.p4.no/nyheter/viggo-kristiansen-nekter- proveloslatelse/artikkel/591147/ Andersen, on the other hand, never showed any emotions, not even when describing killing and rape in detail. And when Andersen met the press the day after Andersen got his final sentence on 19 years, he said that he rather wanted no sentence. Viggo Kristiansen said in the same interview that he felt sorry for his mother and his family about what they had to read about him in the papers.  Timeline after the initial trials  In 2008, Kristiansen filed a motion to re-open his case.http://www.dagbladet.no/download/Kommisjonen.doc Kristiansen had also gotten a new lawyer, Sigurd Kloms√¶t. In 2009, Sigurd Kloms√¶t sued the Criminal investigation chief in Kristansand, Arne Pedersen, since both the police in Kristiansand and a middle manager from the forensics institute, Bente Mev√•g, had informed that the DNA material had been destructed. The case was dismissed by the special unit for police cases.https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/X8a2W/Kaller-Klomsat-userios In 2010, when Bente Mev√•g was on a sick leave, the DNA material turned up. According to Bj√∏rn Olav Jahr's book, a journalist from Dagbladet didn't believe what Mev√•g said was true, and therefore contacted the acting middle manager (Margurethe Stenersen) and the leader of the institute (Ole Gunnar Ballo) when Bente Mev√•g was on a sick leave. At night time they started searching and found the DNA material stored in 199 test tubes in a freezer where they were supposed to be. Margurethe Stenersen also assured that they never throw away DNA material (\\"Why would we?\\"). In 2010, the motion to re-open the case was denied by the authorities, stating that the case was not sufficient for re- opening.http://www.gjenopptakelse.no/?id=316 In 2011, Kristiansen appealed to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, as well has hired leading international forensic biologist Greg Hampikian in order to firmly exclude the possibility of two assailants, with the hopes of exonerating Kristiansen. In 2011, Kristiansen sued the Norwegian Criminal Cases Review Commission for not granting a retrial. He lost the case.http://www.domstol.no/globalassets/upload/obyr/internett/nyheter/viggo- kristiansen-dom.pdf Kristiansen's lawyers described the verdict as an uncritical cheering of the Norwegian Criminal Case Review Commission.https://www.abcnyheter.no/nyheter/2011/09/05/137049/anker-baneheia- avgjorelse In 2012, Kristiansen appealed this to the Supreme Court of Norway. His lawyers hoped that he would be granted a new trial since they had additional case evidence which were not considered during the first court proceedings. Viggo Kristiansen argued that new evidence would acquit him. On March 27 the supreme court rejected his appeal. In 2012, Sigurd Kloms√¶t lost his license to practice law. Kloms√¶t was sentenced for distributing pictures of Anders Behring Breivik to the press in conjunction with his work as lawyer for one of the victims. Kloms√¶t says that \\"strong forces\\" leaked the pictures as a way to get rid of him because of his involvement in the Baneheia case, the Birgitte case, the Bjugn affair, and other cases where he has been bothersome for police and prosecutors.https://vimeo.com/229288977 When Kloms√¶t lost his license, Arvid Sj√∏din took over as Kristiansen's main lawyer. Kloms√¶t got his license back in 2014. In 2014, Viggo Kristiansen sues Jan Helge Andersen for false statements. The case was dismissed. The police's reason for the dismissal was that it was \\"obviously baseless\\". In 2014, Kristiansen's prison psychologist for 10 years said that he thought Viggo Kristiansen was innocent of the crimes, and that this could be proven. For this statement, complaints about malpractice, breach of confidentiality, and other charges, were sent to The Norwegian Psychological Association (NPF) and to the Oslo county.https://www.nrk.no/sorlandet/psykolog-ma-svare-for- behandling-1.11901695 In 2015, Viggo Kristansen's prison psychologist was cleared of all charges, both by The Norwegian Psychological Association (NPF) and by the Oslo county. For the charges of breach of confidentiality, NPF stated that psychologists have a duty to report cases of miscarriage of justice, even when it breaks confidentiality.http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/index.php?seks_id=440428&a;=3http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/barnedrapene- i-baneheia/viggo-kristiansens-psykolog-faar-ikke-kritikk-i- tilsynssak/a/23433023/ In 2016, Arvid Sj√∏din, Kristansen's lawyer, sent a request for new trial based on a new law called \\"objektivitetsplikten\\" (objectivity duty). The new objectivity duty law was created by the government due to cases of miscarriage of justice in Norway, and says: \\"if it appears clear for the prosecutor that there is insufficient proof for conviction, the prosecutor must drop charges or request the accused to be acquitted.\\" In 2017, the state attorney rejected the request for a new trial. Arvid Sj√∏din thought the decision was incomprehensible since \\"the state attorney now seems to consider himself having more knowledge about cell phones than the experts\\". In 2017, Bj√∏rn Olav Jahr wrote a book about the Baneheia case called \\"Drapene i Baneheia. To historier. En sannhet\\" (\\"The Baneheia murders. Two stories. One truth\\"). Jahr is an experienced journalist and author of several books about real crimes. Jahr concluded that Viggo Kristiansen was innocent and that Jan Helge Andersen was the only perpetrator.https://www.vg.no/rampelys/bok/bokanmeldelse-bjoern-olav-jahr- drapene-i-baneheia-to-historier-en-sannhet-varsel-om-justismord/a/24160462/ The book also sparked a lot of public discussion about the case, including several articles and public statements from people expressing doubt about the sentence, and people believing that Kristiansen is innocent.https://www.minervanett.no/baneheia-saken-bor- gjenopptas/https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10213398212323531&set;=a.4281508909716.168711.1046122849&type;=1&theater;http://retfaerd.org/retfaerd- nr-157-2017-3-4/domsfortellingens-plausibilitet-en-analyse-av-rettens- fortelling-i-baneheiasaken/ Legacy The case traumatized the Norwegian society, and made headlines for several consecutive months. The crime created great anger in the S√∏rlandet district and across Norway, so much that one early suspect, a formerly convicted murderer, had to flee his home and sleep outside in a tent out of fear of vigilante violence. Other clients of Andersen's lawyer Ben Fegran threatened to cut all connection with him unless he stopped representing Andersen. By all accounts, Viggo Kristiansen became the most hated and reviled person in modern Norwegian history. Fifteen years after the murders, the name 'Baneheia' is still synonymous with the crime. On the first anniversary for the murders, a huge outdoor memorial service was held in S√∏rstr√∏nens hometown of Grimstad. Artists including Bj√∏rn Eidsv√•g, a-ha, Ole Edvard Antonsen and Morten Harket celebrated the victims' lives from the scene at the granite quarry in Fj√¶reheia. The mother of S√∏rstr√∏nen, Ada Sofie Austegard founded Stine Sofie's Foundation, a charitable foundation that will fight to preserve the rights of children when they are exposed to violence and sex crimes, as well as work to increase the minimum penalty for child abuse. She has ever since been active in promoting laws to protect children on the national level. Sponsoring among others legislation guaranteeing children the right to a public attorney in cases where they are victims of violent or sexual crimes, as well as starting the first national helpline for children. Former Minister of Justice Knut Storberget called the murders \\"the decisive watershed moment in terms of turning the police effort against the violence that affects women and children\\".

With major projects around the world, Kuhne's assignments included the Bluewater Shopping Centre in Kent completed in 1999, the largest shopping mall in Europe, and the Titanic Belfast visitor attraction in Northern Ireland which opened to the public in 2012.  Life  Kuhne was born in San Antonio, Texas of Swiss, Czech, and Swedish heritage and grew up in the Air Force as a son to Major Robert David Kuhne and Thelma Parsons Kuhne. He moved with his sister (Dawn Elyse) and brother (Wes Parsons) from one Air Force base to another, living in San Antonio, Houston, Biloxi, Tampa, Tucson, Chicago, and El Paso, before his father retired in 1962. The family then moved to New Haven, Indiana and into civilian life.Deanna Krinn, \\"Noted Architect designs beer garden: Louis Petro has worked, taught around the US , The News-Sentinel, November 6, 2007. Retrieved on September 7, 2008. During his childhood, his father taught him perspective drawing when he was seven years old. His parents introduced him to architecture and civil engineering through books in their library. His early employment was with a landscape architect in Fort Wayne, Indiana before beginning work as an assistant to Dr Louis G. Petro, a Civil Engineer in Fort Wayne. With Louis G Petro & Associates, between the ages of 14 and 16, he learned drafting, project management, and the fundamentals to both architecture and engineering. He worked for Cole Matson & Matott Architects in Fort Wayne in his final year of high school. Graduating from New Haven High School in 1969, he entered William Marsh Rice University in the School of Architecture. There, he completed a Bachelor of Arts Degree with majors in both Art and Architecture in 1973. Returning to Indiana, he began work for Louis Petro, who was then the head of the Fort Wayne Housing Authority, and within three months he was selected as the Midtown Architect for Mayor Ivan Lebamoff in Fort Wayne. During this time, he completed a new master plan for downtown Fort Wayne. In addition, he restored the farmer's market back to West Berry Street, designed the Courtyards Project (then called the \\"Alley Project\\") at Wayne and Calhoun Streets, and developed the initial plans for Citilights State Park (eventually to become Headwaters Park).Geoff Paddoc, Headwaters Park Mission Statement (park history), Headwaters Park Alliance, January 2015 While in Fort Wayne, Kuhne was also appointed to the Board of the Public Transportation Corporation by Mayor Lebamoff. He was appointed to the Allen County Soil & Water Conservation District by the Governor of the State of Indiana. Traveling in Europe in 1974 under the William Ward Watkin Traveling Fellowship, awarded from the Rice University School of Architecture in 1973, he traveled throughout Europe. Kuhne left Fort Wayne in 1981 to work for the famed post-modernist architect, Michael Graves in Princeton, New Jersey. In the autumn of 1981 Kuhne entered Princeton's Graduate School of Architecture and graduated in 1983 with a Masters of Architecture degree. For his work there, he won the Henry Adams Medal from the American Institute of Architects. Kuhne worked and lived in London in Clerkenwell. In December 2009, he became a British citizen and held dual citizenship with the United States of America. Kuhne died suddenly in London on July 25, 2016 from a heart attack, aged 64 and leaves behind his beloved wife, Pamela. CivicArts Foundation Kuhne conceived his later company CivicArts in 1975 and as five divisions of Research (Edgewater Mail & Breeze), Concept Design (Citilights), Professional Architectural Services (Eric R Kuhne & Associates), Industrial Design & Manufacturing (Tesserax Designs), and Investment (Spondulix Development). While at Princeton, in 1981 he opened Eric R Kuhne & Associates in his apartment on Nassau Street overlooking the entrance to Princeton University. There he hired several colleagues at the School of Architecture and entered design competitions. He won the Columbus Carscape Competition and three Progressive Architecture Design Awards for Courtyards, Headwaters Park, and River Walk. The office was relocated to New York City in 1985 at 50 Walker Street where it remained until 2005 when it was centred in London. All work has been done out of the London Office which was opened in 1994. Sydney, Australia  In 1990, Kuhne visited his sister's family in Sydney, Australia and gave a talk at the University of Sydney School of Architecture entitled \\"Civic Vs Public\\". There he met Malcolm Latham who had just moved from being Director of the National Capital Planning Authority in Canberra to Director of Special Projects in Lend Lease Corporation. Through Latham, he was introduced to Stuart Hornery, Chairman of the Board of Lend Lease. Lend Lease engaged Kuhne's office to work on Darling Park, Australia's largest mixed-use waterfront development in Sydney. There many of the advanced ideas of cities and architecture were incubated. Darling Park continues to be one of the most successful waterfront developments in the southern hemisphere. It includes Cockle Bay Wharf and the Waratah Gardens as part of its completed design of . Worldwide operations Rose Gallery, Bluewater Mall, KentAfter living in Sydney, Kuhne was asked in 1994 to move to England to take over the design of Bluewater Park, the largest retail/leisure destination in Europe. His office led a design and engineering team for Lend Lease's Project Management team to produce Bluewater as nearly of the finest retail/leisure destination in Europe.The Company Without Limits (Bluewater) Opening an office in London, Kuhne began expanding the concentration of researchers, designers, and planners in the United Kingdom. With the addition of BurJuman Gardens Shopping Centrer in Dubai in 1999, Kuhne's firm began working globally to create landmark destinations around the world. Kuhne lectured all over the world about his research, using his projects to illustrate advanced ideas in art, architecture, landscape, urban and industrial design. His talks included \\"Civic Vs Public\\", \\"Stillife Vs Wildlife\\", \\"The Art of the Gift\\", \\"Marketplace of Ideas\\", \\"Skyscrapers vs Starcatchers\\", \\"Ornamental Cities\\" and \\"Five Cities For The Future\\". These talks all explored restoring the quality of story- telling to architecture, gardens and cities.  Philosophy  His design philosophy, which he labels \\"Marketplace of Ideas\\" is to conceive \\"great\\" civic spaces that \\"restore the storytelling quality of architecture.\\" He states, \\"cities have always been marketplaces for commodities, goods, services and faiths\\" but that \\"none of these truly reveres the power of civic life.\\" He argued that retail trade \\"can bring back the pageantry of civic life to cities and towns.\\" Quoted by Save Griffintown Blog, Projet Griffintown: New Design, New Funding\\", Montreal.

This is apparently an old Dutch usage in proper names, perhaps for \\"das\\" (of) contracted into simply 's. Dutch freighter built by Maatschappij Fijenoord, Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1907, of and operated by Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM) in the Dutch East Indies trade. The ship, after seeking refuge in Australia during the Japanese invasion of the islands, became part of the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) command's permanent local fleet. 's Jacob was sunk off Papua New Guinea on 8 March 1943 during World War II by Japanese air attack. World War II service The ship was engaged in logistics support for Allied forces in the efforts to hold the Malay Barrier by the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA). During the final days before Java fell, she was in convoy MS.4 of four tankers and another cargo ship departing Sydney 31 January bound for the ABDA area taking a route south of Australia and up the west coast. On 15 February, the day Singapore fell and as took over the escort, ports in Sumatra were falling and the tankers and other cargo vessel were ordered to return to Fremantle. 's Jacob and Perth continued to be later joined by the Dutch ships Swartenhondt and until, on the evening of 21 February and some 600 miles south of the Sunda Strait, they too were ordered to return to Fremantle. 's Jacob was one of the 21 KPM ships that sought refuge in Australia on the fall of Java that the Commanding General, United States Army Forces in Australia (USAFIA) was instructed to purchase or charter for the SWPA's permanent local fleet. On 26 March 1942, the Chief Quartermaster, USAFIA arranged interim charters pending final negotiations with the Netherlands Government in London. Final negotiations between the War Shipping Administration (WSA) and the Dutch government resulted in their being placed under U.S. Army control through a complex charter arrangement in which the British Ministry War Transport (BMWT) chartered the KPM vessels and with WSA allocated them to SWPA with the stipulation they be under total control of the U.S. Army. They typically were crewed by KPM's Dutch officers and Javanese crew. As part of the war effort, 's Jacob was upgraded and a 4-inch naval gun was mounted aft. The ship was involved in the early days of reinforcements for Port Moresby and Milne Bay in New Guinea. In early September 1942, 's Jacob and left Townsville for Milne Bay in a convoy designated Q2 escorted by and later . On 5 September, the convoy was holding south of China Strait as Japanese naval forces were expected in Milne Bay that night. Arunta escorted Anshun into the port the next day with Swan and 's Jacob awaiting orders south of the strait where they were joined in the night by Arunta. Meanwhile, Anshun was discharging cargo by lights when the port was attacked by Japanese surface forces and she was shelled and capsized by the light cruiser . 's Jacob entering Milne Bay was considered an unnecessary risk, and the escorts were ordered to Port Moresby until the situation stabilized. S Jacob Sinking by the bow Survivors from 's Jacob about to be rescued by (out of picture), 8 March 1943. 's Jacob, escorted by the Australian corvette as part of Operation Lilliput, was transporting troops, weapons, and supplies from Milne Bay to Oro Bay. On 8 March 1943, as 's Jacob rounded Cape Nelson, nine high-flying Imperial Japanese bombers escorted by 12 fighters attacked her near Porlock Bay. The aircraft scored three direct hits and at least 15 near misses, which caused serious structural damage and wounded several crewmen. A large fire started on the foreship, and with the water pumps shutting down preventing any effort to extinguish the fire, the order was given to abandon ship. All those aboard had to jump overboard and clung to wreckage. 158 men were picked up by Bendigo, two of which died on the way to Milne Bay. Within 18 minutes of the attack, 's Jacob slid under the waves at 13:16 off Porlock Harbour. 's Jacob settles by the bow with survivors swimming in the water. Five men were lost in the sinking, including Private George Watson, who remained in the water and instead of trying to save himself, assisted soldiers who could not swim into life rafts. George Watson was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. In 1986, the wreck of 's Jacob was found by divers off Porlock Harbor in of water. The ship's bell was recovered and later donated to the Lae Yacht Club.

For most of his career he worked with Queen Henrietta's Men, one of the leading theatre companies of the time.Edwin Nunzeger, A Dictionary of Actors and of Others Associated with the Representation of Plays in England Before 1642, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1929; pp. 382-3. Nothing is known of Turner's early life or the start of his career; by 1622 he was already a leading player with the Lady Elizabeth's Men. In 1625, Christopher Beeston formed a new company under the patronage of the new queen, Henrietta Maria; some members of the Lady Elizabeth's troupe, including Turner, joined the organization. Turner was a consistent presence in the known casts of the Queen Henrietta's company; he played -- * Justice Landby in Shirley's The Wedding * Old Lord Bruce in Davenport's King John and Matilda * Bashaw Alcade in Part 2 of Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West * Crates and two other minor parts in Nabbes's Hannibal and Scipio. Turner tended to play older men, like Justice Landby and Old Lord Bruce; yet he also took the role of a kitchen maid in Part 1 of Fair Maid Thomas Heywood, The Fair Maid of the West, Parts I and II, Robert K, Turner, Jr., ed., Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1967; pp. 6, 202. -- one of the few cases in which a mature actor, rather than a boy player or young adult actor, is known to have played a female character. During the difficult years of the bubonic plague epidemic of 1636-37, Queen Henrietta's Men left Beeston and the Cockpit Theatre. The company fractured for a time, but in 1637 was reconstituted at the Salisbury Court Theatre, with several veterans, including Turner, as continuing members. Turner apparently won a leading position in the troupe; on 6 March 1640, when the Queen's Men were paid ¬£80 for seven Court performances in the previous two years, Turner was the member who received the payment. On 8 January 1641, Turner and leading man Richard Perkins received royal liveries for fourteen members of the company. Apart from his thespian skills, Turner is the subject of one of the more curious records in the annals of English Renaissance drama: In October 1624, his wife Dorothy got into legal trouble \\"for cruelly beating and abusing her husband Anthony Turner.\\"Nunzeger, p. 382. (Spellings modernized.) Their marriage did not endure; Turner buried another wife, Joan, on 8 February 1640. The parish records of St. Giles in the Fields, home to many theatre people in Turner's era, also record the burials of four Turner children between 1636 and 1651.G. E. Bentley, \\"Players in the Parish Records of St. Giles in the Fields,\\" Review of English Studies, Vol. 6 No. 22 (April 1930), pp. 149-66. Only a few signs of Turner's activity are available after the theatres were closed in 1642, at the start of the English Civil War. In Andrew Pennycuicke's 1653 edition of William Heminges's play The Fatal Contract, the preface is co- signed \\"A. T.\\" -- and this is thought to indicate Anthony Turner. In 1659, Turner got into trouble for acting in plays at the Red Bull Theatre, despite the official ban.Deborah C.

The composite material, also known as Kareline FLX, was developed through a collaboration between Heikki Koivurova, an industrial designer from Joensuu, Kareline, a Finnish manufacturer of composite materials, and the then University of Joensuu. It consists of small wood fibres, in this case from recycled northern spruce, mixed with a thermoplastic bonding agent. The semi-liquid mixture is injection moulded into shape with the fibres set in a predetermined direction. This results in a uniform material with a density of 1,2 kg/cm¬≥ (74906 lb/ft¬≥) and that can be recycled. It is also impervious to humidity and temperature variations. Manufacturing Flaxwood produces and assembles their instruments and parts in Hein√§vaara. The raw material is provided by Kareline and the moulding operations are carried out at All-Plast's facility. The parts that come out of the mould are shaped with the cavities, pockets, joints and practically all the holes. They are then assembled and finished by hand with tools that are commonly used in traditional guitar workshops. Products Guitars =Flaxwood Series= The guitar models of the regular line come with approximately similar features and various pick-up configurations. The bodies are semi-hollow with a backplate and come with either a Gotoh 510UB hardtail bridge, a Gotoh GE-103B tune-o-matic bridge or a Schaller LP tremolo bridge. The glued in necks feature 22 medium jumbo frets, a 25.5\\" scale length and a 1-11/16\\" Tune-X Tuning System nut. Almost each Flaxwood guitar bears a Finnish name representing its main personality and characteristics. Instrument Components Since 2011 Flaxwood has launched a line of components for music instruments such as bolt-on guitar necks, guitar blanks and fingerboard blanks for bowed string instruments. Some of the components are used by other companies like the German violin manufacturer Mezzo-Forte.

He is considered by many to be the father of Spanish Opera and of the Zarzuela Hidalgo was born and died in Madrid. In either 1630 or 1631 he became a harpist at the Spanish royal chapel where he was responsible for the accompaniment of both sacred and secular music and also played for the King of Spain, King Philip IV. Around 1645 he began to serve as leader of the court's chamber musicians and chief composer of villancicos, chamber songs, and music for the theatre. He personifies the origins of Spanish Opera with the work Celos aun del aire matan by the illustrious playwright Calderon de la Barca, based on the story of Cephalus and Procris told in Ovid's Metamorphoses, released on 5 December 1660 to celebrate the third birthday of prince Felipe Prospero. It is considered the oldest opera preserved in Spain Juan Hidalgo dominated secular and theatrical music at the Spanish court until his death. He was a prolific composer and enjoyed a great deal of popularity throughout his career. His place in Spanish theatre history is equivalent to that of Henry Purcell in Britain and Lully in France. He wrote music for at least nine allegorical religious plays that were performed in public for Corpus Christi. His work for the court stages included songs for 16 spoken plays (comedias), many partly sung zarzuelas and semi- operas, and two full operas which are highly regarded. His output also included a large number of sacred villancicos and some liturgical music.

Nostalgia is also becoming heavily monetized by the publishing industry.

Prior to the town being founded the area was referred to as Piche. Bents took its name from Longniddry Bents in Scotland. Its derelict wooden grain elevator was once the subject of a National Geographic photograph. The remnants of the town are now located on private property.  History  Bents was officially established in 1930 along a CPR rail line that ran between Perdue and Rosetown. The railway came through the area in 1929 and at one point Bents boasted several residential homes, a small train station, two grain elevators, a dance hall, a general store (Longworth‚Äôs General Store) and post office - all along a single street. By the 1960s the town began an irreversible decline when the southern section of the rail line was abandoned. The general store, above which lived the proprietor's family, was in business until the early 1960s. The railway continued to run through Bents until the 1970s when it too was torn up around 1977. It was at this time that the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator, built in 1928 with the coming of the railway, closed for good. The United Grain Growers elevator, also built in 1928, was sold to the Wheat Pool in the late 1960s and was also closed and torn down in the 1970s. Today, little remains. Only one of the two elevators, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevator, still stands. There are two houses left. One, belonged to a huge family and the other belonged to an auctioneer. The general store/post-office is still there but in badly deteriorated condition. There are random outbuildings and old farm machinery dotting the former town site. There is also a metal swing-set, missing the swings, sitting alone in the grass beside the general store. The former town site is now private property and has been the subject of vandalism over the years. Any visits to Bents must be arranged with the landowner.

Biography Ross was born in San Francisco, California in 1952, and raised in Sausalito. As a child he became interested in the history of the American Old West by watching television shows such as Bonanza, Rawhide, and Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel, as well as John Wayne films. In 1974 he earned a degree in fine arts from California State University, Chico. Ross had what he describes as an \\"epiphany\\" on June 25, 1976, at the hundredth anniversary commemoration of Custer's Last Stand at the Battle of Little Bighorn, after sitting through a windstorm and observing protesters from the American Indian Movement as well as supporters of General George Armstrong Custer. He decided as an artist to portray iconic American people and events in new ways to bring out a more complex story than the traditional historical myths. He soon moved to Jackson Hole, Wyoming. His first of two daughters was born in 1984. He subsequently lived in Vermont and in Palm Springs, California, supporting himself as a waiter in order to paint. He moved to Ballard, Washingtonin 1991. Most recently he has relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico and opened his own art gallery Due West Gallery Works Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show at Ocean Beach, California in 2008 Ross works in various media including Painting, book illustration, and life-sized recreations of historical scenes. Favorite subjects include Cowboys, Indians, and historical battles in the American Indian Wars. Ross has illustrated at least 20 books, including a history of baseball. In 2001 Ross published a book, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Words and Pictures. In 2002 Ross illustrated the 100th anniversary edition of Owen Wister's novel, The Virginian. Ross' first plywood installation was a 1976 cutout of Clint Eastwood, which he and a friend placed as a prank above a railroad trestle to recreate a scene from Dirty Harry in the location where the scene had been filmed five years earlier. In 1983 Ross created \\"154 Nevermore\\", an installation of 154 plywood ravens on a highway in Jackson, Wyoming (recreated in steel in 2000). In 1984, Ross created \\"the Catch\\", a diorama for the Baseball Hall of Fame illustrating a legendary catch with the same nickname, by Willie Mays in the 1954 World Series. He created a new version of the work in 2004, and displayed it in various locations in New York City. In 1998 Ross created \\"The Defining Moment\\" for SAFECO Field, a tableau of 11 steel cutouts of a Ken Griffey, Junior play in the 1995 baseball playoffs. Ross' 2005 work, \\"Custer's Last Stand\\", was a recreation of life-sized warriors riding life- sized horses the Battle of Little Bighorn at the original site at Medicine Tail Coulee in Montana. That exhibit toured Cody, Wyoming, Jackson, Wyoming, and Sun Valley, Idaho. In September, 2008 Ross recreated a 1902 photograph of Buffalo Bill Cody and his \\"Wild West Show\\", his traveling troupe of Native Americans, in front of the Cliff House at Ocean Beach.

It is an herbaceous perennial that grows from 50 to 100 cm tall. Narrowly lanceolate to narrowly oblanceolate leaves, about 15‚Äì40 mm long, are tufted at the base and are erect to spreading. Inflorescences produce 25-100 dark pink-magenta flowers that bloom August to February in its native range.Raulings, EJ and Ladiges, PY. (2001). Morphological variation and speciation in Stylidium graminifolium (Stylidiaceae), description of S. montanum and reinstatement of S. armeria. Australian Systematic Botany, 14: 901-935.  Distribution and habitat  S. armeria is native to New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria. Its typical habitat has been reported as \\"heathland, woodland and open forests of the Otway Ranges through to the snowfields of the Eastern Highlands.\\"  Botanical history and taxonomy  On 8 July 1805, Jacques Labillardi√®re published a species under the name Candollea armeria. The generic name that Labillardi√®re used, Candollea had been previously published as a genus of Polypodiaceae, so Labillardi√®re corrected the mistake by publishing the species as S. armeria in 1806. In 1878, Jean Baptiste Saint- Lager \\"corrected\\" the gender agreement of Stylidium armeria to Stylidium armerium. This specific epithet, however, is not an adjective but a noun in apposition, so the suffix should not be changed with different gender generic names. Later, Ferdinand von Mueller insisted on using the illegitimate genus Candollea and shifted the Stylidium species back in the late 19th century. Those moves, however, were not widely adopted. In 2001, Raulings and Ladiges recognized several synonyms.

In his 1977 review of the re-release of The Sword of Aldones, Lester del Rey wrote, \\"It presents a somewhat different Darkover than we find in later novels. But even the early stories have the wonderful allure of this strange world.The Reference Library, pg. 169, Lester del Rey, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, March 1977, Vol. XCVII No. 3 Plot summary Lew Alton returns to Darkover after a long absence. He muses about the Sharra Rebellion, which events six years earlier, led to his wife's death. In the spaceport, he meets a woman he mistakes for Linnell Aillard, her near duplicate, but she does not recognize him. Lew arrives at the Comyn Council, with deliberations already in progress. The council is considering accepting the Domain of Aldaran in the Comyn Council, an unpopular move since Aldaran was the seat of the Sharra Rebellion. The council is deeply divided, and Lew sides with the anti-Aldaran faction. Lew reveals that the Sharra Matrix is still active, embedded in the hilt of a sword. During a riding party, several council members discuss the Sharra Matrix. The riding party is attacked by Robert Kadarin. Lew's brother, Marius, is killed, and the Sharra Matrix stolen. There are strong hints that Dyan Ardais is behind this attack and a series of attacks that follow. Lew and Callina Aillard meet with the fantastically old keeper, Ashara Alton. She explains the paradox of the rhu fead. Only a comyn may enter the rhu fead, she says, but only a non-comyn may touch the artifacts stored there. Ashara proposes that an individual of Terran lineage, but acclimated to Darkover, might survive the test. Using the powerful matrix screens, Ashara teleports Kathie Marshall into the tower. She is the woman who is a near duplicate of Linnell Aillard. Ashara also reveals to Lew that he has a daughter, Marguerhia, by the sister of his deceased wife. At the annual Festival Night ball, Lew encounters Dio Ridenow. She tries to warn him that Callina has been taken over telepathically by Ashara. Lew and Regis realize that the Sharra Matrix is present at the ball. Moments later, the ball is attacked by Robert Kadarin and Dyan Ardais. Linnell Aillard is killed, along with two of Dio Ridenow's brothers. Reflecting after these events, Lew realizes that he is in love with Dio. Lew, Callina and Kathie ride to the rhu fead. As predicted by Ashara, Kathie has absorbed Linnell's Darkovan personality, but as a non- comyn, is able retrieve the Sword of Aldones unharmed. Kadarin, carrying the Sharra sword, appears with Thyra Scott and Dyan Ardais. They demand the Sword of Aldones. Thyra attacks Lew, but they are unsuccessful in their attempt to acquire the Sword. The survivors of the attack arrive at the spaceport HQ for medical treatment. Kadarin changes sides and claims everything that has happened was Dyan Ardais's idea. He reveals that Ardais has the Sharra Matrix and has kidnapped Marguerhia Alton. The origin of the Sharra Matrix is explained. In a final conflict, Dyan Ardais, Kadarin, Thyra, Kathie Marshall, and Callina Aillard are killed. Regis Hastur wields the Sword of Aldones to destroy the Sharra Matrix. Dio tells Lew that Ashara Alton is not a living person, but an energy being who has resided in a matrix for centuries, and has the power to inhabit the living. Ashara has killed both Callina and Linnell Aillard in her attempt to possess the Sharra Matrix for herself. Lew reclaims his daughter, Marguerhia, from the spaceman's orphanage. He and Dio leave Darkover with no intention of returning. Regis Hastur agrees to cooperate with the Terran Empire.

The advantageous alleles A and B occur randomly. In sexual reproduction, the two alleles are combined rapidly. But in asexual reproduction, the two alleles must independently arise through clonal interference. The \\"Vicar of Bray\\" hypothesis (or Fisher-Muller Model ) attempts to explain why sexual reproduction might have advantages over asexual reproduction. Reproduction is the process by which organisms give rise to offspring. Asexual reproduction involves a single parent and results in offspring that are genetically identical to each other and to the parent. In contrast to asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction involves two parents. Both the parents produce gametes through meiosis, a special type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half. During an early stage of meiosis, before the chromosomes are separated in the two daughter cells, the chromosomes undergo genetic recombination. This allows them to exchange some of their genetic information. Therefore, the gametes from a single organism are all genetically different from each other. The process in which the two gametes from the two parents unite is called fertilization. Half of the genetic information from both parents is combined. This results in offspring that are genetically different from each other and from the parents. In short, sexual reproduction allows a continuous rearrangement of genes. Therefore, the offspring of a population of sexually reproducing individuals will show a more varied selection of phenotypes. Due to faster attainment of favorable genetic combinations, sexually reproducing populations evolve more rapidly in response to environmental changes. Under the Vicar of Bray hypothesis, sex benefits a population as a whole, but not individuals within it, making it a case of group selection.Wilson, David Sloan and Scott K. Gleeson. A Big Book on Sex (1982) Society for the Study of EvolutionTannenbaum, Emmanuel and Jos√© F. Fontanari. \\"A quasispecies approach to the evolution of sexual replication in unicellular organisms\\", Theory in Biosciences, Springer: Berlin/Heidelberg, , Issue Volume 127, Number 1, March 2008  Disadvantage of sexual reproduction  Sexual reproduction often takes a lot of effort. Finding a mate can sometimes be an expensive, risky and time consuming process. Courtship, copulation and taking care of the new born offspring may also take up a lot of time and energy. From this point of view, asexual reproduction may seem a lot easier and more efficient. But another important thing to consider is that the individuals with the highest fitness are more likely to find a mate and reproduce. Therefore, the chances of offspring with a higher fitness increases. The Vicar of Bray hypothesis proposes that sexual reproduction is more beneficial than asexual reproduction, despite the cost of time and effort.  Origin of the name 'Vicar of Bray'  The hypothesis is called after the Vicar of Bray, a semi-fictionalized cleric who retained his ecclesiastic office by quickly adapting to the prevailing religious winds in England, switching between various Protestant and Catholic rites as the ruling hierarchy changed. Ridley, Matt. The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature (1993), Penguin Books The figure described was Simon Aleyn between 1540 and 1588. The main work of Thomas Fuller (d. 1661), Worthies of England, describes this man:'Bray, St Michael'. A Topographical Dictionary of England. Ed. Samuel Lewis (publisher). London 1848. 350‚Äì353.

Retrieved > 2015-01-03. ‚Äì Worthies of England, published 1662  Origin of the hypothesis  The hypothesis was first expressed in 1889 by August Weismann and later by Guenther (1906). Afterwards, the hypothesis was formulated in terms of population genetics by Fisher (1930) and Muller (1932) and with greater mathematical formalism, by Muller (1958, 1964) and Crow and Kimura (1965). The doubts about the validity of the Vicar of Bray hypothesis caused the upcoming of alternative hypotheses such as: * Best-Man (Williams, 1966; Emlen, 1973; Treisman, 1976): The Best-Man hypothesis proposes that, on average, sexually produced offspring may be of somewhat lower fitness than the asexually produced offspring, but the much greater diversity of the sexually produced offspring implies that they will include a few individuals of extraordinary high fitness. If these individuals have a high chance on survival and reproducing, their offspring might also be of high fitness. If you consider this going on for multiple generations, the proportion of individuals with a high fitness might increase so rapidly that it will be more than sufficient to offset the cost of sex. * Tangled Bank (Ghiselin, 1974; Burt and Bell, 1987; Ridley, 1993): The Tangled Bank hypothesis proposes that sexual reproduction is beneficial when there exists intense competition for space, food and resources. It argues that genetically diverse offspring from sexually reproducing individuals are able to extract more food from their environment than genetically identical offspring from asexually reproducing individuals. * Red Queen (Van Valen, 1973; Hamilton, 1975; Levin, 1975; Charlesworth, 1976; Glesener and Tilman, 1978; Glesener, 1979; Bell, 1982; Bell and Maynard Smith, 1987; Ridley, 1993; Peters and Lively, 1999, 2007; Otto and Nuismer, 2004; Kouyos et al., 2007; Salath√© et al., 2008): The Red Queen hypothesis proposes that organisms must constantly adapt and evolve in order to survive. If a species does not adapt to its evolving natural enemies and the changing environment, it will go extinct. This hypothesis also proposes that sexual reproduction is beneficial. But in contrast to the Vicar of Bray hypothesis, the Red Queen hypothesis states that sexual reproduction does not only benefit the population as a whole, but it benefits individual genes directly. Mathematical models have been used in order to try to prove or disprove these hypotheses. However, for a mathematical model, assumptions must be made. Assumptions on the size of the population, the breeding process, the environment, natural enemies and so on. That is why there will always be populations for which the model does not apply. Some models are better in explaining the ‚Äòaverage‚Äô population, while others better explain the smaller populations or populations that live in a more extreme environment. A good way to decide which model is the best might be to compare the expected result from the model with data from natural observations.Libertini G. (2011): Concordance of the Predictions of a Simulation Model for the Evolutionary Advantage of Sex with Observational Evidence. WebmedCentral; ZOOLOGY; 2(11):WMC002464. People who criticize the Vicar of Bray hypothesis (and all other hypotheses that propose sexual reproduction has an advantage over asexual reproduction) say that sexual reproduction might be beneficial in some situations, but not always, which is why both ways of reproduction still exist. If either sexual reproduction or asexual reproduction would be much more beneficial, evolution should result in one of the two ways of reproduction to disappear and the other one to persist.

A railway station was built at Pindar to service outlying farms, and the townsite of Pindar was gazetted on 22 February 1901. The surrounding areas produce wheat and other cereal crops. The town was a receival site for Cooperative Bulk Handling.  Transport  Until the 1970s, it was served by a narrow gauge line on the Western Australian Government Railways. The railway to Cue was closed on 29 April 1978 but grain freight services to the west continued on a seasonal basis for some years but it is now permanently closed. The main feature these days of the (former) town is the iconic building that was a hotel and now a Bed and Breakfast in tourist season. It was built by Mr Emmott Gill and his wife (formally Mrs Tom Jones) in 1907. There are two magnificent paintings of this building done by the renowned artist, the late Ailsa Small, which are housed in the former Shire Chambers of the Mullewa Shire Offices now all part of the Greater Geraldton Council.

Indian removals in Indiana followed a series of the land cession treaties made between 1795 and 1846 that led to the removal of most of the native tribes from Indiana. Some of the removals occurred prior to 1830, but most took place between 1830 and 1846. The Lenape (Delaware), Piankashaw, Kickapoo, Wea, and Shawnee were removed in the 1820s and 1830s, but the Potawatomi and Miami removals in the 1830s and 1840s were more gradual and incomplete, and not all of Indiana's Native Americans voluntarily left the state. The most well-known resistance effort in Indiana was the forced removal of Chief Menominee and his Yellow River band of Potawatomi in what became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death in 1838, in which 859 Potawatomi were removed to Kansas and at least forty died on the journey west. The Miami were the last to be removed from Indiana, but tribal leaders delayed the process until 1846. Many of the Miami were permitted to remain on land allotments guaranteed to them under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818) and subsequent treaties. Between 1803 and 1809 William Henry Harrison negotiated more than a dozen treaties on behalf of the federal government that purchased nearly all the Indian land in most of present-day Illinois and the southern third of Indiana from various tribes. Most of the Wea and the Kickapoo removed west to Illinois and Missouri after 1813. The Treaty of St. Mary's led to the removal of the Delaware, in 1820, and the remaining Kickapoo, who removed west of the Mississippi River. After the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act (1830), removals in Indiana became part of a larger nationwide effort that was carried out under President Andrew Jackson's administration. Most of the tribes had already removed from the state. The only major tribes remaining in Indiana were the Miami and the Potawatomi, and both of them were already confined to reservation lands under the terms of previous treaties. Between 1832 and 1837 the Potawatomi ceded their Indiana land and agreed to remove to reservations in Kansas. A small group joined the Potawatomi in Canada. Between 1834 and 1846 the Miami ceded their reservation land in Indiana and agreed to remove west of the Mississippi River; the major Miami removal to Kansas occurred in October 1846. Not all of Indiana's Native Americans left the state. Less than one half of the Miami removed. More than a half of the Miami either returned to Indiana or were never required to leave under the terms of the treaties. The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians were the only other Indians left in the state after the end of the removals. Native Americans remaining in Indiana settled on privately owned land and eventually merged into the majority culture, although some retained ties to their Native American heritage. Members of the Miami Nation of Indiana concentrated along the Wabash River, while other Native Americans settled in Indiana's urban centers. In 2000 the state's population included more than 39,000 Native Americans from more than 150 tribes. Indian settlement The Miami people and the Potawatomi were the most important native tribes to establish themselves in the region now known as Indiana., and In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, some of these Algonquians returned from the north, where they had sought refuge from the Iroquois during the Beaver Wars.Glenn and Rafert, p. 20.Archaeologists and historians have been unable connect the prehistoric peoples who once lived in the area to the native tribes that Europeans and American later encountered. It has been suggested that some of these tribes may have been associated with the Central Algonquian-speaking peoples. See Glenn and Rafert, p. 14, and Madison, Hoosiers, p. 9. The Miami remained Indiana's largest tribal group, and had a significant presence along the Maumee, Wabash, and Miami rivers in what is now central and west central Indiana. They also held land in a large part of northwest Ohio. The Potawatomi settled north of the Wabash River, along Lake Michigan in northern Indiana,Madison, Hoosiers, p. 10. and in present-day Michigan. The Wea settled on the middle Wabash, near present-day Lafayette; the Piankeshaw established themselves near the French settlement at Vincennes; and the Eel River band settled along the river in northwestern and north central Indiana. The Shawnee came to west central Indiana after colonists forced them out of Ohio.Glenn and Rafert, p. 36 and 48, and Smaller groups, including the Lenape (Delaware), Wyandott, Kickapoo, and others were scattered across other areas. These native tribes lived in agricultural villages along the rivers and exchanged furs for European goods with French traders, who began to arrive in the late 1600s.Glenn and Rafert, p. 4 and 20. Treaties Early treaties After the French left the area now known as Indiana, early treaties with Great Britain and United States set in motion a series of confrontations between the Indians who lived on the land and the British and U.S. governments who believed they had possession of it by right of conquest and treaty. Following Great Britain's defeat of the French in the French and Indian Wars (Seven Years' War), the Treaty of Paris (1763) gave the British nominal control over North America, east of the Mississippi River.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 15. Pontiac's Rebellion (1763), in which the Miami and Potawatomi tribes joined other Indians to fight the British, succeeded in capturing forts Miamis and Ouiatenon, among others, but the success was short lived. The Royal Proclamation of 1763, which prohibited American colonists from settling west of the Appalachian Mountains was ineffective. Westward movement of Anglo- American settlers onto Indian lands continued.Glenn and Rafert, p. 4, and Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 17-20. After the American Revolutionary War, Great Britain and the United States signed the Treaty of Paris (1783), which ceded to the Americans a large portion of land in North America, including present- day Indiana, but the native tribes who occupied the land argued that they had not been represented in the treaty negotiations and ignored its terms.Madison and Sandweiss, Hoosiers and the American Story, p. 11. Further negotiations were held to establish compensation for the loss of tribal lands, while American military expeditions were called to control Indian resistance. An Indian confederacy waged war against the Americans, but the confederacy was defeated at the Battle of Fallen Timbers (1794), at the conclusion of the Northwest Indian War.Glenn and Rafert, pp. 40-41. With the loss of British military support and supplies after their withdrawal from the Northwest Territory, the defeat was a turning point that lead to land cessions and the eventual removal of most the Native Americans from present-day Indiana.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 30, and Glenn and Rafert, p. 43. The Treaty of Greenville (1795) was the first to cede Native American land in what became the state of Indiana and made it easier for colonial settlers to reach territorial lands north of the Ohio River.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 30. Under its terms, the American government acquired two-thirds of present-day Ohio, a small tract of land in what would become southeastern Indiana, the Wabash- Maumee portage (near the present-day site of Fort Wayne, Indiana), and early settlements at Vincennes, Ouiatenon (in present-day Tippecanoe County, Indiana, and Clark's Grant, (near present-day Clarksville, Indiana, along the Ohio River.Clark's Grant, a tract of land in Indiana's present-day Scott, Clark, and Floyd counties, was awarded to George Rogers Clark and his men for their service during the American Revolutionary War. See Madison, Hoosiers, p. 27. In exchange, the Indians received goods valued at $20,000 and annuity payments.Glenn and Rafert, p. 5, and Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 25-29. Most of the remaining territory, including a large portion of present-day Indiana, remained occupied by native tribes, but the tribes living along the Wabash- Maumee portage had to relocate. The Shawnee removed east to Ohio; the Delaware established villages along the White River; and the Miami at Kekionga moved to the Upper Wabash and it tributaries.Glenn and Rafert, p. 43. Territorial treaties Indian removal followed a sequence of the land cession treaties that began during Indiana's territorial era.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 120. The Northwest Ordinance (1787), which created the Northwest Territory, provided for the future division of western land into smaller territories, including the Indiana Territory, established in 1800.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 33, and Glenn and Rafert, p. 7.The size of the Indiana Territory was reduced to create the Michigan Territory (1805) and the Illinois Territory (1809). See Madison, Hoosiers, p. 34. One of the immediate needs for the federal government and William Henry Harrison, who was appointed governor of the Indiana Territory in 1800 and served until 1812, was to encourage rapid settlement by reducing threats of violence from the area's native tribes and to establish a policy for acquiring ownership of territorial lands.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 34. Harrison initially had no power to negotiate treaties with the tribes; however, after his reappointment in 1803, Thomas Jefferson granted Harrison the authority to conduct negotiations with the tribes and to open up new land for settlement, primarily the American claim to the Vincennes tract. The Vincennes tract had been purchased by the French from the natives in the mid-18th century and transferred to Great Britain after the French and Indian War, and finally to the Americans at the end of the American Revolution. Harrison intended to expand settlement beyond the small population centers of Vincennes and Clarks Grant through a series of land cession treaties. Efforts were also made to establish the Indians as farmers. The other alternative was their removal to unsettled lands farther west. Harrison's tactics to obtain land cessions from the Indians included aggressive negotiations with the weaker tribes first, and then divide and conquer the remaining groups. The American military was available to resolve any conflicts. Harrison offered annuity payments of money and goods in exchange for land as part of his negotiations. He also rewarded cooperative tribal leaders with trips to Washington, D.C., and offered bribes. Negotiations often relied on intermediaries, especially those who could act as interpreters, such as Jean Baptiste Richardville, William Wells, William Conner, and others.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 35 and 37. Between 1803 and 1809 Harrison negotiated land cession treaties with the Delaware, Shawnee, Potawatomi, and Miami tribes, among others, to secure nearly all the Indian land in most of present-day Illinois and the southern third of Indiana for new settlement.Gugin and St. Clair, p. 18, and Madison, Hoosiers, p. 35. In total, Harrison negotiated thirteen land treaties across the Northwest Territory, which included eleven land cession treaties from 1803 through 1809 that encompassed more than 2.5 million acres (10,000 km¬≤) of land in the Indiana Territory. Several factors worked in Harrison's favor: a declining fur trade, the Indians' increased dependency on annuity payments and manufactured goods, and internal conflicts among the tribes, many of whom did not agree with the American concept of land ownership and transfer of land titles.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 36. Harrison's first treaty, the Treaty of Vincennes (1803), was successful in getting the Wea and the Miami to recognize American ownership of the Vincennes tract between Kaskaskia and Clark's Grant. At Vincennes in 1810, Tecumseh threatens William Henry Harrison when he refuses to rescind the Treaty of Fort Wayne. The Treaty of Grouseland (1805) was the second significant treaty to expand the Indiana Territory for additional settlement. Harrison negotiated with the Delaware, Potawatomi, Miami, Wea, and the Eel River band at Grouseland, Harrison's home at Vincennes. Under its terms the tribes ceded their land in southern Indiana south of the Grouseland Line, which began at the northeast corner of the Vincennes tract and passed northeast to the Greenville Treaty Line. Settlers, like Squire Boone, moved into the new land and established new towns, including Corydon--the future capitol--in 1808, and Madison in 1809. Under the terms of the Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) Harrison purchased an estimated 2.5 million acres (10,000 km¬≤) of land, now a part of present-day Illinois and Indiana, from the Miami.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 39. The Shawnee, who were not included in the negotiations, inhabited the western tract of land that the Miami ceded to the federal government sold were angered by its terms, but Harrison refused to rescind the treaty.The Miami claimed most of Indiana as their ancestral territory and argued that the other tribes lived there only by their permission. In August 1810 Harrison and the Shawnee leader Tecumseh met at Grouseland to discuss the continued conflict. Tecumseh bitterly complained about the land ceded to the federal government. Speaking through an interpreter, Tecumseh argued: \\"The Great Sp[i]irit has given them as common property to all the Indians, and that they could not, nor should not be sold without the sent of all.\\"Madison, 'Hoosiers, p. 40. The gathering ended without a resolution, as did a subsequent meeting in 1811. This disagreement escalated into an armed conflict, called Tecumseh's War. The final blow that destroyed the Indian confederacy took place at the Battle of the Thames in Ontario, Canada, where Tecumseh was killed in 1813.Madison, Hoosiers, pp. 40-41 and 43. The War of 1812 and subsequent treaties ended the Indians' militant resistance to dispossession of their lands. Although the Miami, Delaware, and Potawatomi remained in Indiana, most of the Wea band and the Kickapoo removed west to Illinois and Missouri.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 43, and Glenn and Rafert, p. 46. The U.S. government began to change its policy from coexistence with the Indians to increased acquisitions of their lands and provided the first hints of and official removal policy of tribes to the west, beyond the Mississippi River.Glenn and Rafert, p. 51. Treaties after statehood Area of the northern boundary of land cession, west of Delphi, Indiana In 1818 Jonathan Jennings, the first governor of Indiana, Lewis Cass, and Benjamin Parke negotiated a series of agreements collectively known as the Treaty of St. Mary's with the Miami, Wea, Delaware, Potawatomi, and other tribes that relinquished land in central Indiana and Ohio to the federal government. The treaty with the Miami acquired most of their land south of the Wabash River, except for the Big Miami Reserve in north central Indiana between the Eel River and the Salamonie River. Portions of these lands were assigned to individual members of the Miami tribe. These allotments to individuals would protect many of the Miami, especially its leaders, from removal in 1846. The Miami were in good standing with the state because they had opposed Tecumseh and tried to remain neutral during the War of 1812. Under the terms of the treaty, the Miami also recognized the validity of a treaty with the Kickapoo, made in 1809, and led to the Kickapoo's subsequent removal from Indiana. The Wea, who inhabited the area around present-day Lafayette, Indiana, agreed to a $3,000 annuity for their cessions of land in Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. map of the land cession Under the terms of the Treaty of St. Mary's, the Lenape (Delaware), who lived in central Indiana, around present-day Indianapolis, ceded their lands to the federal government, opening the area to further settlement, and agreed to leave Indiana and settle on lands provided for them west of the Mississippi River. In exchange for leaving the state, the Lenape were granted gifts and an annuity totaling $15,500. Most of the tribe left for the West during August and September 1820. The Potawatomi received annuities for ceding a portion of their Indiana land. Several tribal members were given individual grants of reservation land. Most of the Potawatomi did not remove from the state until 1838.Madison and Sandweiss, Hoosiers and the American Story, p. 22. After the years of peace that followed the War of 1812 and the land cessions under the Treaty of St. Mary's, Indiana's state government took a more conciliatory approach to Indiana relations, embarking on a plan to \\"civilize\\" their members rather than remove them. Using federal grants, several mission schools were opened to educate the tribes and promote Christianity; however, the missions were largely ineffective in meeting their goals.Esarey, p. 332. Land cessions resumed in 1819. On August 30, Benjamin Parke concluded negotiations with the Kickapoo to cede their land in Indiana, which included most of present-day Vermillion County, in exchange for goods worth $3,000 and a ten-year annuity of $2,000 in silver. The treaty was not recognized by the Miami, who claimed the Kickapoos' land, but European-American pioneers continued to settle in the area. Other agreements with the Wea, Potawatomi, Miami, Delaware, and Kickapoo were reached in 1819, when the tribes were invited to attend a meeting to establish a trade agreement. Trade with the Indians was among the most lucrative enterprises in the state. In exchange for treaty agreements the Wea were granted a $3,000 annuity; the Potawatomi were given a $2,500 annuity; the Delaware received a $4,000 annuity' and the Miami were granted a $15,000 annuity. Smaller amounts were to other tribes. The annuities were accompanied by additional gifts to tribal leaders that were close to the same value of the annuity payments. Tribes also agreed to annual meetings at trading grounds near Fort Wayne, where the annuities would be paid and tribes could sell their goods to traders. The annual event was the most important trading enterprise in the state from 1820 until 1840. Traders would gather and offer goods to the tribes, often at inflated prices and sell them on credit. After the tribes approved the bills traders would take them to the Indian agent, who would pay the claims out of tribe's annuity funds.Campion, p. 50. (Traders frequently served liquor to their customers and took advantage of their drunken state during trading.Esaray, p. 333.) Many of the leading politicians in the state, including Jonathan Jennings and John W. Davis, took active part in the trade and made significant profits in the enterprise. In exchange for land cessions to the federal government, the Native Americans usually received annuities in cash and goods and an agreement to pay tribal debts. In some cases tribes were granted reservation lands for their use, salt, trinkets, and other gifts. Treaty provisions of land allotments to individuals and families and funds for fences, tools, and livestock were intended to help the Indians assimilate as farmers. Some treaties also provided assistance with land clearing, construction of mills, and provisions for blacksmiths, teachers, and schools.Glenn and Rafert, p. 55-57. The Treaty of Chicago (1821) concluded negotiations between the federal government and the Michigan Potawatomi to cede a narrow tract of Indiana land along the southern tip of Lake Michigan and extended east of the St. Joseph River, near present-day South Bend, along with other lands in Illinois and the Michigan Territory.Campion, p. 38. In this treaty, the federal government also indicated its intention to construct an east‚Äìwest road between Chicago, Detroit, and Fort Wayne. The Treaty of Mississinewas (1826) with the Miami and Potawatomi included most of what remained of the Miami reservation lands in northeastern Indiana and northwestern Ohio, and confined the Miami to their reservations along the Wabash, Mississinewa, and Eel rivers. This included the land they had retained under the Treaty of St. Mary's. During treaty negotiations Lewis Cass described the federal government's rationale for Indian relocation: \\"[Y]ou have a large tract of land here, which is of no service to you-You do not cultivate it, and this is but little game on it.... Your father owns a large country west of the Mississippi-He is anxious that his red children should remove there.\\"Campion, p. 42. The land cessions freed up the first public lands for settlement in northern Indiana, which developed into South Bend and Michigan City and included much of present-day LaPorte County, and portions of Porter County and Lake County, Indiana.Campion, p. 44. The treaty with the Potawatomi also arranged for the purchase of a narrow tract of land, where the federal government would construct the Michigan Road from Lake Michigan to Ohio River. In exchange for Indiana land north of the Wabash River, with the exception of some reserved lands that assured their continued presence in the area, the Miami agreed to receive livestock, goods, and annuity payments, while the Potawatomi received annuities in cash and goods, and funds from the federal government to erect a mill and employ a miller and blacksmith, among other provisions. The federal government also agreed to pay tribal debts. Treaties with the Potawatomi were renegotiated in October 1832, when the tribe was granted larger annuities in cash and goods which totaled $365,729.87,Esarey, p. 342. and set aside land west of the Mississippi River (in present-day Kansas and Missouri) for the tribe's relocation. Removals Although the Delaware, Piankashaw, Kickapoo, Wea, and Shawnee tribes removed in the 1820s and 1830s, the Miami and the Potawatomi removals of the 1830s and 1840s were more gradual and incomplete.Glenn and Rafert, p. 5, and By 1840 the Miami remained the only \\"intact tribe wholly within Indiana.\\"Glenn and Rafert, p. 59. Although the Miami agreed to remove in 1840, their tribal leaders delayed the process for several years. Most but not all of the remaining Miami left in 1846.Glenn and Rafert, p. 5 and 59. Removal of Indiana's Native Americans did not begin immediately after the U.S. Congress passed the Indian Removal Act in 1830; however, the Black Hawk War in neighboring Illinois in 1832 renewed the fear of violence between Indiana's settlers and the local tribes. Other factors lead to the increased pressure for removal. New roads and canals passed through Indian lands within Indiana, providing easier access to settlement in northern Indiana. White settlers also argued that the native tribes had rejected earlier efforts to adapt to \\"civilized society,\\" and suggested that removal west would allow them to progress on their own timetable, away from some of the more negative changes in their lives, most notably the consumption of liquor.Carmony, pp. 554-55. Organized efforts began to remove the native tribes from the state in 1832. In July the Indian Services Bureau of the state was reorganized. Funds were appropriated to hold negotiations with tribal leaders and offer inducements for them to leave Indiana for lands in the West. The rising tensions following the Black Hawk War had also caused alarm among the tribes. By the 1830s white settlers far outnumbered the native tribes still living in Indiana. Some, but not all of the tribal leaders thought resistance would be futile and encouraged their people to accept the best deal for their lands while they were still in a position to negotiate. Other tribes did not want to leave their lands in Indiana and refused to cooperate.Madison and Sandweiss, Hoosiers and the American Story, p. 21. Not everyone in Indiana wanted the Native Americans to leave, but most of their reasons served economic interests. Towns near the reservation lands depended on increased tribes' annual annuities as an ongoing source of revenue, especially the Indian traders. A few of the traders were also land speculators, who purchased the ceded Indian lands from the federal government and sold them to pioneer settlers, amassing considerable profits for their efforts. In addition, land cession treaties often included provisions for payment of claims on Indian debts to the traders.Carmony, p. 554, and Madison and Sandweiss, Hoosiers and the American Story, p. 21. In theory removals were supposed to be voluntary, but negotiators put considerable pressure on tribal leaders to accept relocation agreements. The Congress, under President Andrew Jackson's administration, provided federal authority under the Indian Removal Act to negotiate with native tribes living in eastern states and offer territorial land west of the Mississippi River in exchange lands in the established states. In a series of treaties from 1832 to 1840, tribal leaders surrendered multiple tracts of land in Indiana to the federal government.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 121. According to Indian agent John Tipton, between five and six thousand Indian \\"tribesmen\\" were living in Indiana in 1831; approximately 1,200 of them were Miami and the remainder were Potawatomi. The Potawatomi held title to an estimated three million acres in north central and northwestern Indiana, while the Miami held the Big Miami Reserve, on thirty- four square miles near the Wabash River, and other smaller tracts that totaled more than nine thousand acres.Carmony, p. 554. The Vermillion Kickapoo and some of the Potawatomi, who were under the leadership of Kennekuk, the Kickapoo Prophet, removed in 1832; the forced removal of the Potawatomi in what became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death occurred in 1838; and the Miami ceded all but a small portion of their remaining land in Indiana in treaty negotiations made in 1838 and 1840. A small reservation of Miami land along the Mississinewa River, in southern Wabash County and northern Grant counties, and scattered allotments to individuals were their only lands that the Miami retained for their use after 1840.Glenn and Rafert, p. 54. Potawatomi In the 1830s Indian agents began going through the Potawatomi communities in northern Indiana, offering annuities, goods, payment of tribal debts, and reservation land in the West, among other provisions, in exchange for their land in Indiana. Most of the Potawatomi accepted the terms, including the federal government's agreement to pay for the removal to their new homes. The same type of negotiations with tribes in other states achieved similar results. The Treaty of Tippecanoe (1832), a series of three treaties negotiated with the Potawatomi in October 1832, ceded Indian land in Indiana, Illinois, and part of Michigan to the federal government, except for small reservation lands for tribal use and scattered allotments to individuals. Under these treaties the federal government acquired more than four million acres of Potawatomi land in northeastern Indiana in exchange for annuities worth $880,000, goods worth $247,000, and payment of tribal debts amounting to $111,879. The total aggregate value of these three treaties was more than $1.2 million (about thirty cents per acre). Fourteen treaties made in 1834, 1836, and in 1837 ceded additional tracts of Indiana land in exchange for payments in cash and goods that amounted to $105,440.Carmony, p. 555. The federal government also agreed to set aside reservation land west of the Mississippi River, in present-day Kansas and Missouri, and reduced the Potawatomi holdings in Indiana to a tract of reservation land along the Yellow River. In 1836 alone, the federal government negotiated nine additional treaties with the Potawatomi to cede the remaining Potawatomi land in Indiana. These treaties required the Potawatomi to leave Indiana within two years. The Treaty of Yellow River (1836), one of Indiana's more contentious treaties, offered the Potawatomi $14,080 for two sections of Indiana land, but Chief Menominee and seventeen others refused to accept the terms of the sale.Campion, p. 51. The Yellow River band of Potawatomi living near Twin Lakes, Indiana, led by Chief Menominee, refused to take part in the negotiations and did not recognize the treaty's authority over their band. Under the terms of treaties made in 1836, the Potawatomi were required to vacate their land in Indiana within two years, including the Yellow River band. Menominee refused: \\"I have not signed any treaty, and will not sign any. I am not going to leave my land, and I do not want to hear anything more about it.\\" Father Deseille, the Catholic missionary at Twin Lakes, also denounced the Yellow River Treaty (1836) as a fraud. Col. Pepper, the federal government's treaty negotiator, believed that Father Deseille was interfering with their plans for removal of the Potawatomi from Indiana, and ordered the priest to leave the mission at Twin Lakes or risk prosecution.McKee, \\"The Centennial of 'The Trail of Death',\\" p. 34-35. The federal government refused Menominee's demands, and the chief and his band were forced to leave the state in 1838. Indiana governor David Wallace authorized General John Tipton to forcefully remove the Potawatomi in what became known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death, the single largest Indian removal in the state.Carmony, p. 556. Beginning on September 4, 1838, a group of 859 Potawatomi were force marched from Twin Lakes to Osawatomie, Kansas. The difficult journey of about , in hot, dry weather and without sufficient food or water, lead to the death of 42 people, 28 of them children.Funk, pp. 45-46.Madison, Hoosiers, p. 122. Subsequent treaties with other Potawatomi tribes ceded additional lands in Indiana and removals continued. In a treaty made on September 23, 1836, the federal government agreed to purchase forty- two sections of their Indiana land for $33,600 (or $1.25 per acre, the minimum purchase price the government could receive from the sale of public lands). A treaty made with the Potawatomi on February 11, 1837, provided for further cessions of Indiana land in exchange for a parcel of reservation land for tribal members on the Osage River, southwest of the Missouri River in present- day Kansas, and other guarantees. Another small group of Potawatomi from Indiana removed in 1850. Those who had been forcefully removed were initially relocated to reservation land in eastern Kansas, but moved to another reservation in the Kansas River valley after 1846. Not all the Potawatomi from Indiana removed to Kansas. A small group joined an estimated 2,500 Potawatomi in Canada.Campion, p. 53. Miami Under the terms of treaties negotiated in 1834, 1838, and 1840, the Miami ceded further land in Indiana to the federal government, including portions of the Big Miami Reserve along the Wabash River. In the treaty agreement made in 1838, the Miami ceded a large portion of Miami reservation land in Indiana for annuities, cash payments to tribal leaders Jean Baptiste Richardville and Francis Godfroy, payment of tribal debts, and other considerations. Under the terms of the Treaty of the Wabash (1840), another large tract of the Miami Reservation was ceded to the federal government for $550,000, including annuities, payment of tribal debts, and other provisions. The Miami also agreed to remove to lands secured for them west of the Mississippi River. Allotment of lands to individuals made under the treaties with the Miami permitted some members of the tribe to remain on the land as private landholders under the terms of the Treaty of St. Mary's. Individuals also received additional land allotments in subsequent treaties. Allotments given to tribal leaders and others were intended to reinforce the European concept of land use, but they could also be interpreted as bribes.Glenn and Rafert, p. 52. In five treaties negotiated with the Miami between 1818 and 1840, Jean Baptist Richardville received 44 quarter sections of Indiana land in separate allotments and Francis Godfroy received 17 sections.Campion, p. 48. The remaining Miami reservation land was ceded to the federal government in 1846.Funk, pp. 15-16 The major removal of the Miami from Indiana began on October 6, 1846. The group left Peru, Indiana, and traveled by canal boat and steamboat to reach their reservation lands in Kansas on November 9, 1846. Six deaths occurred along the way and 323 tribal members made it to the Kansas reservation. A small group removed in 1847. In all, less than one half of the Miami removed from Indiana. More than a half of the tribe either returned to Indiana from the West or were never required to leave under the terms of the treaties.Carmonly, p. 557. After removal Indian lands ceded to the federal government were sold to new owners-settlers and land speculators. More than three million acres of the ceded lands in Indiana were sold in 1836 alone. The financial panic of 1837 slowed the land rush, but it did not stop it. Squatters also hoped to claim a portion of the former Indian land. Under the provisions of the Preemption Act (1838), the squatters who were heads of families and single men aged twenty-one or older were allowed to claim up of up to 160 acres; the right was later extended to widows.Campion, pp. 54-55. Native Americans remaining in Indiana after the 1840s eventually merged into the majority culture, although some retained ties to their Native American heritage. Some groups chose to live together in small communities, which continue to exist. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century other Native American groups migrated to Indiana, a large portion of them were Cherokee. The Miami Nation of Indiana is concentrated along the Wabash River. Other Native Americans settled in Indiana's urban centers, such as Indianapolis, Elkhart, Fort Wayne, and Evansville. The state's population in 2000 included more than 39,000 Native Americans from more than 150 tribes.Glenn and Rafert, p. 6, and See also * History of Indiana * Trail of Death Notes References    External links Potawatomi Native American history of Indiana Native American genocide Former Native American populated places in the United States Aboriginal title in the United States ","title":"Indian removals in Indiana"},{"id":"19226492","text":"KJNT (1490 AM) is a radio station licensed to cover Jackson, Wyoming, United States.

In his earlier years as a radio DJ he was known as Chuck Dann and Charlie Tuna.  Life and career  Charles D. Hanks Jr. was born July 21, 1940, in Kaplan, Louisiana. The first child born to Charles and Irene Hanks, he was nicknamed Danny. In 1952, the family moved to Duncan, Oklahoma where he graduated from high school in 1958. He was soon working at radio station KOMA in Oklahoma City, where he was first known as Chuck Dann, then later as Charlie Tuna. (It was at KOMA that Chuck Riley gave a young Art Ferguson his air name -- Charlie Tuna.) In 1964 he was on the air as Chuck Dann on CKY in Winnipeg. From there he went to WKYC in Cleveland in 1967, again as Chuck Dann. By 1972, he had married, had a son and was the dominant afternoon drive jock at WIBC in Indianapolis as Chuck Riley, the name he would use from then on. Riley was also known throughout Indianapolis as the voice of Indy's 1st ever Rock 40 music station Stereo 93 WNAP having recorded the now legendary and iconic \\"The wrath of The Buzzard\\" TOH ID. During his years at WIBC, Riley would often travel to Toronto, Ontario to narrate various radio documentaries for CHUM 1050.

Although \\"Revisiting the Don,\\" one of only two newly written works on the album, was commissioned and performed in 2006, the album's title is a joke on its lateness as an album, released 252 years after Mozart's birth (\\"it seemed more appropriate to miss the beat by two years\\"). The album also includes \\"In Re Don Giovanni,\\" Nyman's first composition for the band, which is based on the first fifteen bars of \\"Madamina, il catalogo √® questo\\" from Don Giovanni, six selections from Peter Greenaway's film, Drowning by Numbers, in which he was instructed to base the music on the slow movement of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante K. 364, and two duets and an aria from Nyman's television opera, Letters, Riddles and Writs, in this recording featuring bass Andrew Slater as Leopold Mozart and contralto Hilary Summers as Wolfgang. The album appears on emusic's list of The Best Albums of 2008.  The music  Nyman's liner notes are relatively brief and refer the reader to Pwyll ap Si√¥n's The Music of Michael Nyman: Texts, Contexts and Intertexts for an extensive analysis of the relationship of Mozart's music to Nyman's.

Early days Clement Wilks was born at Peckham Rye, Surrey, 15 February 1819, the youngest son of the Rev. Mark Wilks, of Paris. He spent most of his early years in France and Switzerland and took his degree of Bachelor of Arts at the Coll√®ge de Paris in 1836. After being engaged for a short time on the Paris to Saint-Germain-en- Laye railway, which opened in 1837, he went to England and was articled to Sir Charles Fox, then of the London works and Resident Engineer of the London and Birmingham Railway. His professional education was continued with Messrs. Fox, Henderson and Co. until 1841. In 1842 he had the chief management of a French engineering establishment on the Garonne, where he remained for three or four years. He then returned to England and was engaged to work with Mr. George Watson Buck, M.Inst.C.E. on the Ely and Huntingdon railway, then in the course of construction. After Mr. Buck's retirement from ill-health, he was associated with Mr. John Hawkshaw in surveying for the Manchester and Southport line and subsequently for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway near Heckmondwike. In 1850 he was engaged in superintending the construction of various public buildings in London, under the direction of the Society for Improving the Dwellings of the Poor, a model of one of which was erected in connection with the Great Exhibition of 1851. Engineer, Colonial Victoria In 1852, Clement Wilks left England for Australia, and immediately after arriving in Melbourne joined the Victorian Public Service, as an Assistant Colonial Engineer. He was an Engineer for the Central Road Board in the colony of Port Phillip, Australia, from 1854 to 1862.Civil Establishment 1856 VIC PP 1858‚Äì9 (1). Wilks practised as an architect and engineer, having prepared designs for the Congregational Church, 24 Lyttleton Street West, Castlemaine in 1855 (Listed on the Register of the National Estate: Place 4203) Clement Wilks was appointed Ballarat Road Engineer in 1857 having initially been stationed in Barkers Creek or Castlemaine. He had originally surveyed the Ballarat-Amherst main road (now the Old Ballarat Road) on which a series of unusually well-crafted bluestone bridges survives near Glendaruel, possible also to his design. He was also responsible for maintenance of the infamous corduroy road between Bungaree and Ballarat on the route from Geelong. This section of the so-called 'Plank Road' became legendary as a yardstick for bad roads in the colony of Victoria. It would appear that prior to Wilks being stationed in Ballarat, the roads of the district were administered from Melbourne. Wilks also served on the Ballarat Sludge Commission, which was given the role of solving the flooding and silting problems caused by damage done by gold mining along the creeks. Wilks remained in the post until January 1860 when he took a year's leave of absence to attend to 'urgent family matters in Europe', possibly in Switzerland where his family had connections, and he visited the United States and Canada, and then returned to Australia and resumed his former duties. He joined the Department of Roads and Bridges in 1864, and reported on the road to the River Jordan Goldfield in the same year.Track to River Jordan Goldfield Votes and Proceedings LA VIC, 1864-5 C7. Wilks was a member of the Yarra Track Committee responsible for building this coach and dray road to the Woods Point Goldfields. He designed a number or small bridges and culverts including the Wilks Creek Bridge, that commemorates his name, on the Marysville Road. (Listed on the National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register: B6439National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Register: B6439 and on the Register of the National Estate: Place 102643). Built in 1871 as part of the historic \\"Yarra Track\\", its thrust blocks indicate an original under-strutted design; it probably originally had a single span. The timber superstructure of the Wilks Creek Bridge was rebuilt by Monash & Anderson in about 1900 and it was probably at this time that it was altered to 2 spans. Wilks may have also been responsible for the design of The Big Culvert also on the \\"Yarra Track\\".

Alexander Mackenzie was a foreman on the construction of the Carthcart Tower and later went on to become Canada's second prime minister 1873-1878. It was his work crew whose boat capsized while returning from Cedar Island, drowning 17 men. Hamilton Cove was subsequently renamed Deadman's Bay. Cathcart Tower Kingston Ontario Built in 1848, this limestone tower is 11 m high and 16.5 m in diameter. It is surrounded by a shallow ditch and by a glacis extending to the shorelines on three sides. The guns of Cathcart Tower covered the eastern approaches of Kingston Harbour. The towers' construction was prompted by a dispute between Great Britain and the United States over the boundary between British Columbia and Oregon that threatened to lead to war (see Oregon crisis). When war was averted, Cathcart Tower was used for a time as a barracks for soldiers garrisoned at nearby Fort Henry. Eventually it was abandoned. It is part of the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications National Historic Site, the Rideau Canal and Kingston Fortifications UNESCO World Heritage site, and is within the boundaries of Thousand Islands National Park (formerly St. Lawrence Islands National Park).

Serving as a faculty member of Emory University, Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, and University College London, he contributed to the field of gene regulation in the immune system and to the understanding of inflammation in the eye. Ono served as the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati and is currently the 15th president and vice chancellor of the University of British Columbia. Early life and education Born November 23, 1962, Santa J. Ono is the son of mathematician Takashi Ono, who emigrated from Japan to the United States in the late 1950s. He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and also raised in Philadelphia and the northern suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended Towson High School. Ono graduated with a BA in biological science from the University of Chicago and a PhD in experimental medicine from McGill University in Montreal. He holds a PhD, honoris causa from Chiba University. He was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University supported by the Helen Hay Whitney Foundation. Scientific career The Human Major Histocompatibility Complex : HLA region of Chromosome 6. The class II MHC encoded class II genes reside in the HLA-D region Ono completed his fellowship at Harvard and then held faculty positions at Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University, University College London (UCL), and Emory University. He was GlaxoSmithKline Chair of Biomedical Science and head of the department of immunology at the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology and honorary staff member at Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. From March 2006 until September 2008, he served as vice provost for academic initiatives and deputy to the provost at Emory University in Atlanta. He was promoted to senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs in September 2008 and also served as professor of ophthalmology, medicine, pediatrics and biology. In September 2010, he became senior vice president and provost for academic affairs at the University of Cincinnati. Ono has studied on ocular surface inflammation and the immune basis of age- related macular degeneration. His early work focused on the association of certain MHC haplotypes with susceptibility and resistance to type 1 diabetes. Using a number of recombinant and congenic rat strains, the work mapped susceptibility genes in the BB rat to the class II MHC loci. His work also showed that class I and II MHC gene products are expressed at higher levels or de novo on the insulin-producing beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. He focused much of his research in the next decade on the regulation of MHC gene expression. He showed that the different class II MHC isotypes are differentially expressed and showed that the X2-box cis-element controls this differential expression. His work also showed that the bZIP transcription factor: XBP1 forms a hetero-dimer with c-Fos. This has turned out to be relevant to the developmental control of B cell differentiation. His lab also discovered the NFX1 transcription factor and cloned both the human and murine cDNAs. This factor can bind DNA, RNA and protein via a reiterated RING finger motifs in the central domain of the polypeptide. The protein appears to have important roles in neuronal development and mRNA transport. NFX1 is also a probable E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. These enzymes are of interest as they have been shown to participate in 3 metabolic pathways: ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, parkinson's disease, and huntington's disease. His lab also demonstrated that the non- histone chromosomal protein HMGA is required for the induction of multiple genes, including MHC genes, interferon-gamma and rhodopsin. They mapped the interaction of HMGA1a and the paired homeodomain motif within Crx and showed that these interactions help recruit such transcriptional activators to the promoter/enhancer. Using transgenic mouse technology, they also showed (concurrently and independently of Alfredo Fusco), that fusion proteins between HMGA2 and other C terminal peptides (following chromosomal translocation) can drive the development of lipomas and generate obese mice. Further contributions in the field include the mapping of the HMGA2 promoter/enhancer. More recently, his laboratory determined the role of beta-chemokines in mast cell-dependent inflammation in the ocular surface. The work showed that chemokines not only contribute to leukocyte recruitment, but can cooperate with other mast cell activation signals to trigger mast cell degranulation. Finally, his lab showed that certain autoantibodies might contribute to the pathogenesis or exacerbation of AMD and other rapid onset retinal degenerative diseases and may constitute useful biomarkers for the screening for AMD and its progression. Administrative work Human eye cross-sectional view. Allergic conjunctivitis involves mast cell-dependent inflammation in the mucosal surface (conjunctiva) of the eye. Macular degeneration results from photoreceptor death in the macula. Normal vision (B&W;). The same view with age-related macular degeneration (B&W;). At Harvard, he served as head of the Inflammation, Immunity and Transplantation Focus Group at the Schepens Eye Research Institute. There, he served on the executive committee of the Harvard Program in Immunology and on two NIH Training grants within ophthalmology (Ocular Immunology and Molecular Bases of Eye Diseases). He worked with the late president J. Wayne Streilein and COO Ken Trevett and others in developing a strategic plan for the Schepens Eye Research Institute at Harvard and helped attract funding from entities such as the Markey Charitable Trust and the Fidelity Investments. Ono was then recruited to UCL to the Cumberlege Chair and then as GSK Professor. Major funding from the Wellcome Trust, Fight for Sight, and GSK supported the development of a new immunology division at the UCL-Institute of Ophthalmology which grew to 27 members. While at UCL, he also took on administrative duties including as associate dean of students and as a member of the UCL Council (the university's governing board). In 2006, Ono moved to Emory University as senior vice provost for undergraduate education and academic affairs.Santa J. Ono on LinkedIn He had oversight of student enrollment activities, certain aspects of academic affairs and other responsibilities related to initiatives within the university strategic plan. In June 2010, he was named senior vice president for academic affairs and university provost at the University of Cincinnati, with oversight of budgets, personnel, and planning. During that time, he helped lead major initiatives, including Phase I of the university's Academic Master Plan which was released on April 11, 2011. In 2012, Ono was named the 28th president of the University of Cincinnati, and became the first Asian-American president of that university and in the state of Ohio. At UC Ono lead the implementation of the Academic Master Plan that invested $100 million into academics at the institution, including strengthening advising, the Honors Program and Study Abroad. During his tenure the university completed a $1 billion capital campaign 5 months ahead of schedule. Considerable investment in the campus and surrounding area occurred during his tenure, including renovations of 6 colleges and of Nippert Stadium and Fifth Third Arena. U Square at the Loop, a $78 million mixed use development was opened during his presidency. UC also invested heavily in faculty recruitment, bringing over 300 new faculty to the university in cluster hires.

Warkworth lies about 9 km to the south-west, Snells Beach the same distance to the south, Omaha is about 7 km to the east, and Leigh about 13 km to the north-east. The Matakana River flows through the town and into Kawau Bay to the south-east. The surrounding area contains several vineyards and breweries, developing a name for pinot gris, merlot, syrah and a host of obscure varietals. Offering 'a slice of rural community life', the area offers craft outlets, markets, boutique stores, and country cafes. The reasonable proximity to Auckland (around one hour's drive off-peak) has led to the region becoming a trendy getaway spot for foodie Aucklanders. 'Under Matakana's Spell', Cuisine magazine. Lonely Planet describes the village: > \\"Around 15 years ago, Matakana was a nondescript rural village with a > handful of heritage buildings and an old-fashioned country pub. Now the > locals watch bemused as Auckland‚Äôs chattering classes idle away the hours in > stylish wine bars and cafes.\\" From 2018, it is served by 7 buses a day between Warkworth and Omaha. From 2013 it had 5 buses a day and is also served by Mahu City Express. Matakana has had a bus since at least 1930, including buses to Auckland.  History  MƒÅori inhabitants of the area were from NgƒÅti Raupo, a hapu of Te Kawerau, NgƒÅti Manuhiri) and NgƒÅti Rongo. Crown purchases started in 1841 with the Mahurangi Purchase, described by the Waitangi Tribunal as, \\"a crazy quilt of multiple and overlapping transactions\\". Loggers then moved in to fell the kauri and other timber. George Darroch had a large shipyard building timber ships by 1852, which continued for over 50 years. By 1853 John Heyd'n's sawmill was at the falls on the Matakana river. Flax was also harvested. Matakana's first public building, the Presbyterian School and church, opened in 1864. By 1881, Matakana had about 150 people and most of the bush had been cut. Agriculture replaced it, especially fruit. Matakana Dairy Factory opened in December 1902; the building is now a shop. A shark oil factory opened in 1905 and continued till at least 1921 and the industry longer. Electricity came to Matakana in 1936. Matakana's First World War Memorial commemorates New Zealand servicemen from the Matakana area who died while serving during the First and Second World Wars.  First World War Memorial  Matakana's First World War Memorial is a listed landmark dedicated to thirteen men from the district who lost their lives in the First World War. The memorial was unveiled on 24 April 1920 by Joseph Gordon Coates, making it the first statue memorial unveiled in New Zealand following the 1918 armistice. Following restoration of the memorial, on 24 April 2000 another plaque dedicated the memorial to seven men from the district who died in the Second World War. The memorial features an early statue of George V that was sculpted from Oamaru stone by a New Zealand sculptor, William Henry Feldon.William Henry Feldon Instead of ordering a sculpted figure from overseas, which soldier and politician Sir James Allen recommended at the time, local subscribers commissioned Feldon for the memorials in Matakana, Papakura, Helensville, Mercer, Otahuhu, and the Arawa Memorial in Rotorua. For a small community of 313, Matakana suffered a fatality rate twice the national rate. The memorial was sited prominently on donated land at the town junction next to the wharf where the servicemen were fare welled. Matakana's local militia unit became a troop of the Auckland Mounted Rifles. Feldon was the Brigade major of the Auckland Mounted Rifles. The theme of the statue has George V in field marshal cavalry full dress uniform. In the statue's right hand is a scroll signifying the King's Proclamation of 7 November 1918 calling for two minute's silence, in the left hand is an Auckland Mounted Rifles sword prepared to be raised in victory. The statue has been vandalised and restored several times. In 2006 the memorial was moved from its original location on the corner of Matakana Wharf Road and Matakana Road to a nearby site in the Matakana Wharf Reserve. The original site is now occupied by the 'usable art' Matakana Toilets.Northern Steamship Company's ss Kotiki (1898‚Äì1931) at Matakana Wharf in 1909.

Weltpfadfindertreffen) was held August 3 to 12, 1951 and was hosted by Austria at Bad Ischl in Upper Austria. The attendance was 12,884 from 61 different parts of the world, with 675 German Scouts given a warm welcome as official participants in a World Jamboree for the first time. The Austrian contingent was slightly outnumbered by the Commonwealth contingent, and had reduced the minimum age for their attendees from 14, the normal Jamboree age, to 13, since the revived organization had only been in existence for five years. The 7th World Scout Jamboree was also the last Jamboree for which Austria were the host country. Prologue At the 1949 International Scout Conference in Norway, invitations for the 1951 Conference and quadrennial World Jamboree were presented by Austria and Denmark. The vote was overwhelmingly in favor of Austria as it was a small country, a World Jamboree had never been staged there, Austrian Scouts had been forbidden in 1938 and had made their own comeback in 1946. The majority of the countries represented at the Conference had been at war with the then Austrian State only five years before, and there was a great desire to show that the brotherhood of Scouting was a reality. In voicing the invitation, the Austrian International Commissioner, Adolf Klarer, said that the Seventh Jamboree \\"would have to put up with great simplicity.\\" This itself appealed to the Conference as suiting the primary purpose of World Jamborees, to bring Scouts together from all over the world and so strengthen the feeling of unity and fellowship, so the \\"Jamboree of Simplicity\\" was born. Symbols The emblem for the campsite was an image of the fleur-de-lis scouting logo surrounded by a Jew's harp; on the campsite, over 10,000 Jew's harps were subsequently purchased. A camp song Br√ºder auf und h√∂rt die Melodie (Arise brothers and hear the melody) was composed by Alexej Stachowitsch and accompanied with backing music. Austria's postal delivery service also designed and produced over 1,000,000 copies of a commemorative stamp for the occasion. Jamboree As at the 1947 Moisson Jamboree, there were many difficulties to be overcome by the 10,000 Austrian Scouts. The Austrian government administered the country under foreign control, still divided into American, British, Soviet and French occupation zones. Preparations were started immediately, and the site near Bad Ischl in the Salzkammergut was selected in November 1949 while snow lay on the ground. The budget for the Jamboree was fixed at six million Austrian Schillings, after J. S. Wilson added 15% to the Austrian estimate, anticipating that staples like milk would inflate in price, which they did. 500,000 Schillings were granted as a subsidy of the Austrian Federal Government. The final contribution fee for each participant equated to 338 Schilling (‚Ç¨24.56). Doubts has been expressed because while Bad Ischl was in the American Zone, it lay close to the Soviet Zone. However, Austrian Scout troops had been permitted to start and carry on quietly in the Soviet Zone, and no attempt was made to interfere with them, so members of these troops also attended the Jamboree. The main campsite was divided into seven different sub-campsites, with each one being named after a different federal state of Austria. Two further campsites also housed the heads of the delegation as well as guests. 521 so-called \\"Service Rovers\\" also helped support the setting up of the grounds. During the event seven lit towers were erected to symbolize previous Jamborees. As the name of each Jamboree was announced, a flag was hoisted on one of the towers and the song of that Jamboree sung. Other key events included the official opening and closing of the campsite, a bridge building competition for partaking Scouts, and two bonfire evenings for both participants and visitors of the Jamboree. One Scout attended from Japan, knowing no language other than his own and the word \\"Jamboree\\", yet he made the journey with no problem. The sight of Scouts waving the welcome flags at the airport told him that he had arrived at the right place. Contingents came from Algeria, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, British Guyana, Burma, Cameroon, Canada, Ceylon, Chile, Cuba, Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Egypt, El Salvador, France, French Equatorial Africa, French West Africa, Gibraltar, Great Britain, Greece, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Malaya, Mexico, Morocco, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Sierra Leone, Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Togo, Tunisia, the United States, Venezuela and Vietnam. Exile Scouts from Eastern Europe participated in the contingents of Germany and Austria. Reunions In 1991 and 2001 (organised in conjunction with the state campsite b.open) a reunion of the 7th World Jamboree took place in Bad Ischl. Additional stones were placed next to the original memorial stone for the jamboree. The Australian contingent and New Zealand contingents to the 7th World Jamboree still have reunions every two years..

Beginning in 1909, Sacharoff regularly visited Paris. By 1912, she and Lloyd had settled in the city and were married. She exhibited frequently, in solo as well as group shows, including the annual exhibitions organized by the Salon d'Automne.New York, Perls Galleries.

Both Sacharoff and Lloyd became active members of the circle that formed around the Russian √©migr√© avant-garde artist Marie Vassilieff. The outbreak of World War I forced Sacharoff and Lloyd to relocate to Spain. The couple initially settled in Mallorca, but moved to Barcelona in 1915 or 1916.Juan Cort√©s, Olga Sacharoff (Madrid, 1960), p. 13. From 1917 to 1924, Sacharoff collaborated with Francis Picabia on the magazine 391, which is considered representative of Dadaism. Among those writers and artists appearing in the four issues of the magazine were Guillaume Apollinaire and Marie Laurencin. During this period, Sacharoff developed a colorful \\"na√Øve\\" style influenced by Henri Rousseau. Sacharoff continued to participate in the Salon d'Automne; her work was also featured in the annual shows of the Salon des Tuileries and the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. Although her involvement in these exhibitions required that she spend significant time in Paris, she maintained a home in Barcelona. Sacharoff and Lloyd separated in 1929 and, depressed by the breakup of her marriage, Sacharoff stopped painting for approximately five years. She resurfaced in 1934 with an exhibit at Barcelona's Laietanes Gallery. In 1939, Perls Galleries in New York City organized a two-person exhibition featuring paintings by Sacharoff and Lloyd, which suggests a possible reconciliation between the couple. The Galer√≠a Syra, Barcelona, mounted exhibitions of her work in 1950 and 1955, and in February 1960, she was the focus of a solo show organized by the Direcci√≥n General de Bellas Artes and on view in the department's exhibition hall in Madrid. She was awarded the Medalla d'or de Barcelona in 1964, an honor that established her connection to Spain and commemorated her contribution to Catalan culture. The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya, Barcelona, and the Museo de Art Nouveau y Art D√©co, Salamanca, are two of several Spanish institutions that have collected her paintings.

Although the mechanisms, causes and clinical syndromes are different, the pathogenesis is the same‚Äîthe circulatory system fails to maintain the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues and to remove the carbon dioxide and other metabolites from them. The failure may be hypovolemic or distributive. A common cause of this could be shockhttp://www.spaceref.com/iss/medical/4044.shock.circ.collapse.em.pdf or trauma from injury or surgery.http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001605#pone.0001605-Heckbert1 Types A general failure is one that occurs across a wide range of locations in the body, such as systemic shock after the loss of a large amount of blood collapsing all the circulatory systems in the legs. A specific failure can be traced to a particular point, such as a clot. Cardiac circulatory collapse affects the vessels of the heart such as the aorta and is almost always fatal. It is sometimes referred to as \\"acute\\" circulatory failure. Peripheral circulatory collapse involves outlying arteries and veins in the body and can result in gangrene, organ failure or other serious complications. This form is sometimes called peripheral vascular failure, shock or peripheral vascular shutdown. A milder or preliminary form of circulatory collapse is circulatory insufficiency.  Causes  A very large range of medical conditions can cause circulatory collapse.Oxford Textbook of Medicine: 3-Volume Set By David A. Warrell, Timothy M. Cox, John D. Firth, Edward J.

In the English Census of 1851, Hammersley and his wife Jane lived in Regents Park, London, with their 8 month old son, also William J. Hammersley gave his occupation as 'studying for the church'. By the 1861 Census, Jane was living, without William, in Hampton Wick, on the outskirts of London, with the couple's four children. Jane described herself as an 'annuitant', and had a live-in servant. Hammersley migrated to Australia in about 1856. Upon his arrival in Melbourne he became a member of the Melbourne Cricket Club. He worked as a sports journalist for Bell's Life in Victoria and later The Australasian, where he was sporting editor until 1882, writing on cricket under the pen-name of \\"Longstop\\". He captained the first Victorian XI to visit Sydney for an inter-colonial match in 1857 and played a few more matches until 1861. He was the first person to use the term \\"test match\\" to describe important international matches, which he did during the English cricket team's tour of Australia in 1861-62. He was a personal friend of fellow Cambridge cricketer Thomas Wentworth Wills and helped to give momentum to Wills calls to form a football club. In 1859 he became a founding member of the Melbourne Football Club and involved in popularising the club's football code. Hammersley is also believed by some to have been instrumental in introducing Australian Rules to Sydney and in the early formation of the New South Wales Football Association. He died on 15 November 1886 in the Melbourne suburb of Fitzroy and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery.

Bands of marble up to several meters thick are scattered within this metamorphic complex. Around northern shores are volcanic rocks of variable composition from the Jurassic period. Soils around the lake are mostly well drained or rapidly drained gravelly sandy loams or gravelly loamy sands with brown podzolic profile development. Some meet the definition of podzols under the current Canadian system of soil classification. A small area of peat lies near the southern end of the community of Shawnigan Lake. Ecology Fish in the lake include rainbow trout, cutthroat trout, kokanee salmon and smallmouth bass. Their populations are sufficient to support a recreational fishery.

He is credited with the initial invention of the digital audio player, in 1979.Boffey, Daniel Apple admit Briton DID invent iPod, but he's still not getting any money Daily Mail, 2008-09-08. Retrieved on 2008-09-08. Portable data processing and storage system, United States Patent 4667088 Invention of the DAP In 1981 Kramer filed for a UK patent for his newly conceived digital audio player, the IXI. UK patent 2115996 was issued in 1985, and was issued in 1987. The player was the size of a credit card with a small LCD screen and navigation and volume buttons and would have held data of at least 8 MB of solid-state bubble memory chip with a capacity of 3¬Ω minutes' worth of audio. Plans were made for a 10-minute stereo memory card and the system was at one time fitted with a hard drive enabling over an hour of recorded digital music. His first investor was Sir Paul McCartney. Later, Kramer set up a company to promote IXI and five working prototypes were produced with 16-bit sampling at 44.1 kilohertz with the pre-production prototype being unveiled at the APRS Audio/Visual trade exhibition in October 1986. In a 2004 interview with The Guardian, Kramer stated that the company at the time had \\"orders worth ¬£60 million\\" (value at current day) for the device from the recording industry. However, in 1988 a boardroom dispute within Kramer's company and the subsequent failure to raise the ¬£60,000 required to renew the patent resulted in the patent lapsing and entering the public domain, though Kramer is still the owner of the designs. iPod testimony In 2008, Kramer was called as a witness by Apple Inc. to defend itself from charges of patent infringement for its iPod digital audio player.Arno Frank, einestages: Tech-Pionier Kane Kramer: Der wahre iGod, (Der Spiegel online, 19 October 2012) Apple Computer Inc. v.

It was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 19 January 1634; it was staged by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. It was first published in quarto by Richard Meighen in 1636. A number of critics have considered it \\"Davenant's most successful and influential comedy.\\"Michael V. DePorte, in: The Later Jacobean and Caroline Dramatists: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1978; pp. 198. Herbert was initially unhappy with The Wits, particularly on account of its oaths and explicit language; the influential courtier Endymion Porter interceded with King Charles I to tolerate and allow the play, which then proved popular at Court.Joseph Quincy Adams, Jr., ed., The Dramatic Records of Sir Henry Herbert, New Haven, 1917; reprinted New York, Benjamin Blom, 1963; pp. 22, 59. Davenant would eventually become an effective courtier himself;Deborah C. Payne, \\"Patronage and the Dramatic Marketplace under Charles I and II,\\" Yearbook of English Studies, Vol. 21 Special Number (1991), pp. 137‚Äì52. the 1636 edition contains Davenant's dedication of the play to Porter, and a commendatory poem by Thomas Carew. The Wits has been seen as anticipating aspects of Restoration comedy, especially in its \\"strong, unsentimental, witty heroine\\" ‚Äî \\"Lady Ample represents the Restoration ideal of a woman being the equal to a man in all respects.\\"Howard S. Collins, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 198. When Davenant became manager of the newly organized Duke's Company at the beginning of the Restoration era, one of the first plays he produced was The Wits (1661), with Thomas Betterton in the lead role and Hester Davenport as Lady Ample. The Wits was republished in 1665, in an octavo volume that also included The Platonick Lovers. In a revised form, The Wits was included in the edition of Davenant's collected works issued by Henry Herringman in 1673. Sources In plotting The Wits, Davenant depended upon a play of the previous generation, Middleton and Rowley's Wit at Several Weapons. The common story involved two male relatives, an older and a younger. The older fancies himself a \\"wit;\\" he controls the family fortune through the rules of primogeniture, and denies his younger relative any funds. The younger man, impoverished but truly clever, manipulates and cheats the other, until the older man has to concede that the younger has triumphed in a contest of wit, and allows him an income. Davenant's two brothers, the Elder Pallatine and the Younger Pallatine, are versions of Sir Perfidious Oldcraft and Wittypate Oldcraft in the Middleton/Rowley play. Both comedies also feature an old guardian who tries to arrange an undesirable marriage for the pretty young woman who is his ward; the old guardian must be fooled and outmaneuvered by the play's youngsters for a happy ending. Synopsis The opening scene introduces the Younger Pallatine and his henchmen, Pert and Meager, two discharged soldiers. The overall plot is quickly delineated. To finance his planned con-games, Pallatine has to borrow money from Lucy, the girl he loves; she has traded in her small supply of jewellery for funds for Pallatine. The second scene shifts to the Elder Pallatine and his confederate Sir Morglay Thwack. Both are wealthy landowners from the north of England, who have developed an absurd plan; outfitting themselves in flashy clothes, they have come to London to live by their wits. They intend to pursue liaisons with women, and moreover to depend on those prospective lovers for income, like gigolos. They even have a division of labour: the Elder Pallatine will pursue the younger women, while the grey-haired Sir Morglay will concentrate on the widows. The Younger Pallatine reproves them over their intentions, but the two are deaf to him. And since the Elder Pallatine intends to live by his wits, he thinks his younger brother should do so too, telling him, \\"Never hereafter...Will I disburse for you again; never.\\" Act II brings on the third group of characters, Lady Ample and her servants Engine and Ginet. The Lady is a young heiress who has been under the guardianship of Sir Tyrant Thrift ‚Äî a guardianship that is scheduled to end the next day. Sir Tyrant has gone to find a husband for Lady Ample, to further his control over her; but the Lady has plans of her own. As his name indicates, Sir Tyrant is a skinflint who has allowed his ward and her servants meager upkeep; Lady Ample has surmounted this by allowing herself to be courted by rich men, and using their expensive presents of gems and other fine things to improve her standard of living. The Lady's cousin Lucy bursts in with distressing news. Lucy's aunt has learned of the money she gave to young Pallatine; assuming (incorrectly) that Lucy has surrendered her virginity to her lover, the aunt has tossed the girl out of her house. Ample is also offended at Lucy's conduct ‚Äî but over the fact that Lucy has given money to a man, instead of the other way around. Given the would-be gigolos' plans, it is not surprising that the Elder Pallatine and Sir Morglay find their way to Lady Ample. Their attempts at courtship are offensively inept. The play's two sides are now drawn: Lady Ample and her followers, and young Pallatine and his, are united in the goal of humiliating the two self-styled wits and cheating them of their money. With the help of a complaisant constable and his night watch, the conspirators launch a series of tricks that victimise first the Elder Pallatine, then Sir Morglay, and finally Sir Tyrant Thrift; each man falls victim to his greed and folly. The Elder Pallatine is locked in a trunk for hours; Sir Morglay buys his freedom with his last hundred pounds; Sir Tyrant thinks he is arrested for sacrilege and robbing a church. In the end, the conspirators are rewarded with ample funds; the Elder Pallatine graciously concedes that his younger brother is his superior in wit, and endows him with one of his country estates. The Younger Pallatine and Lucy can now marry; and Lady Ample agrees to take the Elder Pallatine as her husband, as long as he acknowledges her superiority in cleverness.

Leeke purchased his promotion to lieutenant on 20 November 1823, and remained in the 52nd until 2 September 1824 when he exchanged into the 42nd Regiment of Foot, on half-pay. Despite the fact that he was by then studying at Cambridge, he returned to full-pay as a lieutenant in the Ceylon Regiment on 28 May 1828, by exchange. He sold out on 28 August 1828. University studies and work for the Church of England After leaving the army, Leeke attended Queens' College, Cambridge, gaining a BA in 1829 and an MA in 1832. In 1829 Leeke was ordained deacon in the Church of England, serving as curate at Westham, Sussex. He was ordained priest in 1830, by the Bishop of Chichester, and in 1831 became stipendary curate at Brailsford with Osmaston, Derbyshire. Then, in 1840, was appointed Perpetual curate of Michael's Church at Holbrook in Derbyshire, living in Holbrooke Hall, with Thomas William Evans as a patron. Leeke was also Rural Dean of Duffield, from 1849. While at Cambridge, in 1827 Leeke instituted the Jesus Lane Sunday School in an attempt to improve conditions in the local slums. His work eventually resulted in the establishment of an elementary school, which has now evolved into Parkside Community College. His four sons also volunteered at the Sunday School during their respective times in Cambridge while students at Trinity. He wrote a number of works on church matters, including an address on the abolition of pluralities. Family In 1828, Leeke married Mary Ann Cox, daughter of John Cox, of Derby. Her sister Maria married George Gawler, a fellow officer of Leeke's from the 52nd Foot. They had four sons ‚Äì Edward Tucker, Henry, John Cox and Samuel ‚Äì and four daughters. Two of Leeke's sons entered the church. Edward Tucker became sub-dean of Lincoln Cathedral, and John Cox was made Bishop of Woolwich in 1905. Henry was a notable athlete, competing in the throwing events for Cambridge University, and English Amateur champion for the hammer throw. His son, Henry Alan Leeke, represented Great Britain in the throwing events at the 1908 Summer Olympics. Samuel was a barrister at Lincoln's Inn. He was called to the bar in 1873, and worked up until his death at 77 in 1925.

The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment The history of Lord Seaton's regiment, (the 52nd light infantry) at the battle of Waterloo; together with various incidents connected with that regiment, not only at Waterloo but also at Paris, in the north of France, and for several years afterwards: to which are added many of the author's reminiscences of his military and clerical careers during a period of more than fifty years was published in two volumes in 1866. Leeke's account of the Battle of Waterloo caused some controversy, since he claimed that official records erred in ascribing the defeat of Napoleon's Imperial Guard to the British 1st Foot Guards.Leeke (Vol I), p. 79ff Leeke claimed that the 52nd Foot alone, under the command of Sir John Colborne (later Lord Seaton), was responsible for turning the flank of the Imperial Guard in the last stages of the battle, ensuring the victory, stating on the title page of both volumes that: > The author claims for Lord Seaton and the 52nd the honour of having > defeated, single-handed, without the assistance of the 1st British Guards or > any other troops, that portion of the Imperial Guard of France, about 10,000 > in number, which advanced to make the last attack on the British > position.Leeke (Vol II), p. iii Leeke also lamented that Wellington's despatches had unfairly made no mention of Colborne's vital command, and the 52nd's \\"daring feat\\".Leeke (Vol II), p. 80 His memoirs were partly inspired by what he felt to be a \\"very great injustice [that] has been done to Lord Seaton and the 52nd Light Infantry, which regiment he commanded at Waterloo, by those who have attempted, in subsequent years, to write the history of that great battle\\", and that he considered \\"the truth, with regard to what we knew the 52nd had achieved at Waterloo, ought to see the light\\".Leeke (Vol I), p. v Published works *A Few Suggestions for Increasing the Incomes of many of the Smaller Livings and for the almost total Abolition of Pluralities, more especially addressed to the Members of Both Houses of Parliament , Derby : Printed by William Bemrose, and sold by Hatchard, 1838. *Memorials to the Archbishop of Canterbury, from Seventy-two of the Clergy of Derbyshire, on the Abolition of Pluralities, 1839 *The history of Lord Seaton's regiment, (the 52nd light infantry) at the battle of Waterloo ..., volume 1, London : Hatchard and co. 1866. *The history of Lord Seaton's regiment, (the 52nd light infantry) at the battle of Waterloo ..., volume 2, London : Hatchard and co. 1866. *Papers on The Observance of the Lord's DayCrockford's Clerical Directory London: Horace Cox, 1868 Notes References * Gray, Ronald D.; Stubbings, Derek; (2000) Cambridge Street-names: Their Origins and Associations, UK: Cambridge University Press , excerpts available online *Leeke, William (1866) The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment: Volume I, London: Hatchard and Co., available online *Leeke, William; (1866) The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment: Volume II, London: Hatchard and Co., available online 52nd Regiment of Foot officers 19th-century English Anglican priests Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge British Army personnel of the Napoleonic Wars British writers 1797 births 1879 deaths British military historians Clergy from the Isle of Wight People from Holbrook, Derbyshire Military personnel from the Isle of Wight ","title":"William Leeke"},{"id":"19227060","text":"Mike Hamilton (sometimes listed as Michael Hamilton) is an American guitarist, singer and songwriter.

However, between the years 2006 and 2011, HIV prevalence rates in Egypt increased tenfold. Until 2011, the average number of new cases of HIV in Egypt was 400 per year. But, in 2012 and 2013 it increased to about 600 new cases and in 2014 it reached 880 new cases per year. According to UNAIDS 2016 statistics, there are about 11,000 people currently living with HIV in Egypt. However, unsafe behaviors among most-at-risk populations and limited condom usage among the general population place Egypt at risk of a broader epidemic. Among officially reported cases, heterosexual intercourse is the primary mode of transmission of HIV (49.1 percent), followed by homosexual intercourse (22.9 percent), renal dialysis (12 percent), and blood transfusion (6.2 percent), according to the National Aids Program (NAP) in an official report issued in January 2008.\\"Health Profile: Egypt\\" . United States Agency for International Development (March 2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. Males are four times more likely to have HIV than females, but this may be due to more men being tested than women. Other people likely to be exposed to HIV in Egypt include street children, prisoners, and refugees. A United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded Biological-Behavioral Surveillance Survey was conducted by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) to explore HIV prevalence rates among most-at- risk groups. The survey targeted street children, female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs). The study identified an infection rate of 6.9 percent and 7.7 percent in MSM and intravenous drug users respectively. These statistics fuel some of the hypotheses that there is a concentrated HIV epidemic occurring in Egypt among high-risk groups, but due to social stigma and lack of prevalence data, it is not acknowledged. Nonetheless, over time, the Egyptian government has made efforts to improve the lives of people with HIV and AIDS in the country.  History  Egypt reported its first case of HIV/AIDS in 1986. This was about the same time that other countries in the Middle East and North Africa region also started seeing their first cases of HIV. In 1987, one year after the discovery of the disease in Egypt, the National Aids Program (NAP) in Egypt was formed. By March 1993, there were 359 people infected with HIV. In 1990, the NAP tested over 135,000 blood bags and only four were HIV positive. Still, many of the early cases came from infected blood products or dialysis. In 1993, approximately 60 kidney dialysis patients became infected with HIV, while in 1997 about 20 people became HIV positive from infected blood transfusions. Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region  In the early 1990s several studies suggested that there was overall a very low, presence of HIV in the MENA region. By the end of 1996 only 27,000 people in the region died of HIV related causes while in Europe and sub-Saharan Africa that number was 170,000 and 4.6 million respectively. But, over time, research revealed that there were more HIV cases in the region than accounted for. Still, the HIV prevalence rate in MENA is less than that of Tuberculosis and Diabetes. In 2009, the United Nations Development Program placed the MENA region in the lowest category for antiretroviral therapy (ART) access in the years 2003-2006, but access has improved over time. Even though great progress has been made in the HIV continuum and the general understanding of the disease globally, progress in the MENA region has been limited due to lack of data and surrounding controversy. While it is estimated that only two percent of people with HIV are from the MENA area, the region has one of the fastest growing epidemics. Initially, many people were unconcerned about the disease due to its stigmatization, allowing the HIV epidemic to become more of an issue as time progressed. This is especially true in the MENA region where people thought, and some still do, that HIV only effects marginalized groups such as MSM and IDUs. Thus, those who didn't identify with these groups dismissed HIV as an insignificant issue.  HIV transmission and prevention  In Egypt, HIV is most prevalent in high risk groups including street children, female sex workers (FSWs), men who have sex with men (MSM), and injecting drug users (IDUs). Globally, the average percentage of HIV infections through blood transfusions/products is only 5 percent. However, in Egypt, about 24 percent of all its known HIV cases are from infected blood products. There's also been five outbreaks in renal dialysis because of unsterile equipment. While the MOHP established an infection control program in 2003, controlling these infections is still challenging due to lack of training, proper equipment, and the fragile Egyptian health care system. In regards to intravenous drug use, between 16 percent and 41 percent of recreational drug users in Egypt use injected drugs, and about half of those have shared or reused syringes. One study explored sexual relations within the Egyptian population to determine prominence of HIV transmission and found that of the 74 percent in the study that were sexually active, 15 percent had more than three partners in the last month and 58 percent had never used a condom. About 26 percent of all HIV cases in Egypt occur in MSM and studies conducted by the NAP revealed very low rates of condom usage, along with multiple sexual partners among the MSM population. Additionally, many of the transmission cases are due to disease and to foreigners visiting or citizens living outside of the country, fueling some people's beliefs that HIV is a western disease. Although HIV prevention is not as comprehensive in Egypt as other parts of the world, the conservative religious beliefs in the country, both of the Muslim majority and the Coptic minority, provide their own form of protection. For instance, they frown upon promiscuity, homosexuality, and sex before marriage. These religious norms, along with widespread male circumcision, have resulted in decreased HIV transmission rates. However, over-reliance on the protection created by religious and cultural values has made HIV stigma and denial a problem. The protection that these values provide is counterbalanced by the stigma and discrimination that accompany those who defy these boundaries, leading to less HIV testing and treatment. Thus, the overall net impact on prevention is modest.  Societal stigma  Egypt still faces several challenges in maintaining low prevalence of HIV/AIDS. There is a general reluctance on the part of the government and civil society to discuss issues related to marginalized groups such as MSM, FSWs, and IDUs. The conservative nature of Egyptian society stigmatizes these high-risk groups, making HIV surveillance studies in Egypt more difficult. The General Penalties Laws in Egypt criminalize commercial sex work and intravenous drug use, as many other countries do. However, there are also other laws that criminalize homosexual activity, stating that it is inappropriate social conduct and an insult to religion. In some parts of Egyptian society, it is considered immoral to have HIV. Additionally, the mortality of people with HIV only seemed to justify the conservative society's view of homosexuality and promiscuity as sinful actions. These views further the cloud of stigma and shame associated with having HIV in Egypt and prevent people from utilizing the HIV testing services. In addition, there a lack of effective STI/HIV/AIDS education programs and other preventive measures, such as peer education, outreach work, and behavior change communications among at-risk groups. This stems from the lack of overall knowledge about the disease. According to recent studies, there is an imminent need for improved education of healthcare workers about HIV/AIDS in Egypt. Specifically, a 2016 study performed at Tanta University Hospital in Tanta, Egypt revealed that there were high levels of discrimination and stigma against people living with HIV among health care workers. Overall, of the 310 studied participants, 40 percent said that they would be worried about providing care to HIV patients. About 21.3 percent said they would be worried about touching cloths of patients with HIV, 27.4 percent said they'd be scared to get blood samples from people with HIV, and 26.4 percent said they'd be worried to dress HIV patients' wounds. Additionally, 34.8 percent of the physicians studied and 65.8 percent of the nurses believed that irresponsible behavior led to patients' HIV infections. A collaboration between UNAIDS, the Egyptian Ministry of Health, and numerous Egyptian universities was established to help better train medical personnel to deal with the disease, as a way to fight the present stigma and misconceptions. Additionally, the lack of knowledge about the disease among Egyptian youth has the potential of greatly broadening the epidemic. In 2010, there were over 1,500 Egyptian youth (ages 15‚Äì24) with HIV. While only 11% of HIV cases in Egypt are among the youth, the early average age of sexual initiation, and increasing tendencies of premarital sex could augment these rates.  HIV testing and treatment  Because of the stigma around the disease, many people in Egypt are afraid to get tested for HIV. In the years before 2004, the majority of HIV cases recorded in Egypt were due to mandated testing, such as for blood donors, foreigners staying in the country for more than six months, and citizens applying for permits to work overseas. Even though voluntary testing was available, people were discouraged from utilizing these services because of the requirement that those who tested positive be identified and reported to the MOHP. According to UNAIDS statistics, about 6,500 people know of their HIV positive status, which is 57 percent of those who are infected. In 2005, the MOHP, with the help of Family Health International (An Egyptian organization funded by U.S. Agency for International Development), established a system of voluntary confidential counseling and testing (VCCT) for anonymous testing, which encouraged more people to find out their HIV status. Moreover, many people who get diagnosed with Tuberculosis get tested for HIV. More specifically, in 2010 about half of the TB patients got tested for HIV. Currently, less than 1 percent of adult TB patients are HIV-positive. However, continued monitoring is necessary because an increase in the incidence of HIV- TB co-infection could add to the complexity of fighting both diseases in Egypt. By the end of 2006, according to UNAIDS, 22 percent of HIV-infected women and men were receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). In 2014, about 1,323 people received ART treatment. In 2016, that number increased to 3,100 people, which is about 27 percent of the infected population. In 2010, a qualitative study was conducted to gather data about ART adherence and limitations. They interviewed 27 HIV positive Egyptian women who had been receiving ART for at least three months. The results showed that there were five key factors that served as obstacles to adherence to treatment, which were \\"fear of stigma, financial constraints, characteristics of ART, social support, and reliance on faith.\\"  National response   National Aids Program (NAP)  The NAP is the official governmental body responsible for HIV/AIDS prevention. Its goal is to maintain the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS and improve health care services for those infected or affected by the disease. It performs blood screening, provides free Antiretorviral Therapy (ART) for those infected, encourages HIV testing, and provides support for those with HIV and their families. The organization also aims to raise awareness about HIV in the general public and among high risk groups, using mass media as one of the means of doing so. Additionally, they established anonymous hotlines, distributed condoms, and partnered with various non- governmental organizations (NGOs). The NAP formed the National Strategic Plan (2006‚Äì2010) to build on the successes of the previous five-year plan. It was designed to maintain the low prevalence of HIV/AIDS and improve health care services for those infected or affected by the disease. The plan's objectives included strengthening HIV/AIDS surveillance, expanding HIV/AIDS response, increasing awareness among the population, developing outreach and educational programs, growing the testing and counseling services, and improving the overall quality of life for people infected and affected by HIV. Government actions and results  Since 2005, the Government of Egypt has become more actively involved in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The government established nine mobile VCCT (Voluntary Confidential Counseling and Testing) centers and 14 fixed centers around the country. With the help of Family Health International, it also conducted trainings for physicians and nurses on clinical management and nursing care, created self-care guides in Arabic and started to promote the use antiretroviral therapy. Additionally, the Ministry of Health has also been fighting the issue of lack of adherence to drug treatments by many HIV positive citizens. It started implementing case management programs that follow up with patients and provide psychological counseling and resources that will help the patients adhere to their specific treatments and deal with the stigma of the disease. These programs were established in numerous health centers that are associated with the Ministry of Health. In 2006, Cairo was the site of a three-day, UNAIDS-supported workshop on HIV/AIDS and drug use in the region. The workshop included representatives of governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and research programs from the Arab countries as well as from Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan. The Egyptian government worked with UNICEF to help prevent HIV/AIDS among youth and worked with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to address HIV/AIDS among IDUs. Moreover, the Egyptian government, led by former First Lady Suzanne Mubarak, started a campaign to educate the public about HIV as a way to fight the spread of disease The government has worked to integrate HIV/AIDS into preparatory and secondary school curriculums.  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria  In March 2008, Egypt negotiated a six-round grant with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria with the goal of \\"Reinforcing HIV/AIDS Prevention and Care Efforts in Egypt.\\" The grant start date was April 1, 2008 and the end date was December 31, 2016. Throughout its duration, the project collected a cumulative amount of approximately $9 million. Some of the objectives of the project included: establishing a strong and supportive environment for the treatment and care of HIV, improving the current surveillance and monitoring data, preventing HIV transmission, including mother-to-child, reducing risk among the most impacted groups, and increasing access to treatment and other services for all people living with HIV in Egypt.  Military government treatment research  On Feb. 22, 2014, a government-sponsored public service announcement aired on an official Egyptian T.V. channel where Major General Ibrahim Abdul Atti, the chief of the Egyptian Army Medical Team, announced the military's new medical devices, C-FAST and CCD for the treatment of AIDS. The announcer made ambitious claims about the devices that the Egyptian military scientists were working on. He proclaimed that the C-FAST was a breakthrough minimally invasive device that could detect and diagnose diseases, such as HIV, with electromagnetism. At the same time, the announcement stated that another device called CCD was currently being tested in trials but had high success rates of curing AIDS through blood purification. A short video accompanied the announcement showing the supposed devices at work. However, even though many major networks and media in Egypt ran with this news, there was no scientific basis to these claims made by the military scientists. In June 2014, the military personnel went back on their claims, stating that these devices needed additional testing because their original trials did not have large enough sample sizes. Now, further research is still being conducted by military medical personnel into the treatment of HIV and the widely spread Hepatitis C virus.

Although this new prevalence rate is significantly lower than the 2005 UNAIDS estimate of 1.8 percent, it is considered to reflect improvements in surveillance rather than a shrinking epidemic. Papua New Guinea accounts for 70 percent of the subregion's HIV cases and is the fourth country (after Thailand, Cambodia, and Burma) to be classified as having a generalized HIV epidemic. Papua New Guinea's first case of HIV was reported in 1987 and in the 1990s HIV prevalence rose steeply. In the years after 2002, approximately 2,000 new infections were reported annually, leading to a belief that there was increasing trend in the projected number of new infections, particularly in rural areas. The National AIDS Council (NAC) and National Department of Health of Papua New Guinea estimated that 46,275 people were HIV-positive by the end of 2006. However, current (2015) WHO data suggest that the HIV epidemic has been 'stabilizing and declining'; an estimated 32 000 people were living with HIV as of 2013 and the adult HIV prevalence was 0.7; the number of people on antiretroviral therapy between 2007 and 2013 increased five-fold from 2 250 to 14 781 respectively. The mode of transmission of HIV/AIDS in Papua New Guinea is predominantly heterosexual activity, with most cases occurring among people aged 20 to 40, according to a 2006 report by the National AIDS Council Secretariat and National Department of Health. The ratio of HIV-infected women to men is about one to one. Those most at risk include sex workers, their clients, and the partners of clients. In 2006, HIV prevalence of 14 percent was found among female sex workers in Port Moresby, according to UNAIDS. Transactional sex is common, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, where a 2006 study found that 55 percent of women interviewed had exchanged sex for money, goods, or both, and 36 percent of men had paid for sex. According to the Papua New Guinea Institute of National Affairs, the spread of HIV/AIDS has typically occurred in areas surrounding mining and logging sites as well as along transportation routes. Children under age 18 are particularly vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. UNICEF reports that 10,946 children were HIV-positive, and 9,400 were orphaned by AIDS as of 2005. A number of factors contribute to Papua New Guinea's growing HIV epidemic. Papua New Guinea shares an island with Papua, Indonesia, which has the highest HIV prevalence in Indonesia (4 percent) and has close to a third of all Indonesia's HIV cases. The proximity of Papua New Guinea to a high-prevalence neighboring region is cause for concern. Condom use is low, with only 24 percent of young men and 13 percent of young women in Port Moresby using condoms, according to UNAIDS. Other factors include a high proportion of the population that is of reproductive age and an average age at sexual debut of 15 for both sexes. Risky sexual activities, such as multiple partner relationships, high rates of transactional sex, and sexual violence against women, are common. Knowledge about HIV transmission and prevention is low. High levels of urban migration have broken down traditional methods of social control. The national response to HIV/AIDS is also challenged by the large number of cultural and linguistic groups, geographical difficulties, and socioeconomic conditions associated with poverty and unemployment. Given the current situation, there is a need to address gender aspects, including male roles and the feminization of the epidemic. Stigma and discrimination are also ongoing problems, resulting in families neglecting people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Papua New Guinea has a high tuberculosis (TB) burden, with 111 new cases per 100,000 people in 2005, according to the World Health Organization. In addition, 9.7 percent of adults with TB were co-infected with HIV in 2005. High rates of HIVTB co-infections increase the difficulty of treating both diseases.Health Profile: Papua New Guinea . United States Agency for International Development (September 2008). Accessed 20 March 2009. National response Papua New Guinea's national AIDS response has been overseen and coordinated by the National AIDS Council (NAC) since 1997. The council is a multisectoral committee, comprising representatives of government departments, councils of churches, the National Council of Women, the Chamber of Commerce, nongovernmental organizations, and PLWHA. The council's secretariat provides support, running day-to-day operations. The National Strategic Plan for 2004‚Äì2008 focuses on seven priority areas of intervention: treatment, counseling, care, and support; education and prevention; epidemiology and surveillance; social and behavioral change research; leadership, partnership, and coordination; family and community; and monitoring and evaluation. The Plan stresses the importance of expanding access to voluntary counseling and testing services, especially at the district and provincial levels; ensuring the clinical management of opportunistic infections such as TB; and providing antiretroviral therapy (ART) to PLWHA. In 2006, the National AIDS Council finalized the Gender Policy on HIV/AIDS and its implementation plan and a Workplace Policy Tool Kit on HIV/AIDS, currently implemented by private and public sector entities. In 2004, the Government of Papua New Guinea introduced prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV projects at six hospitals; however, according to UNAIDS, fewer than 3 percent of HIV-positive pregnant women were receiving ART in 2005. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria approved Papua New Guinea for a fourth-round grant in 2005 to scale up HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment through an intensified multisectoral community-based program. National AIDS Council of Papua New Guinea The NAC, led by its secretariat, is responsible for the formulation of policy for the prevention, control and management of HIV and AIDS. The secretariat comprises twenty five members, including eight Program Advisers and sixteen technical and support staff at national level. The secretariat is chaired by Sir Peter Barter, OBE, and its president is Mr Wep Kanawi CSM, OBE. Performance The NAC has been subject to a number of controversies since its inception, all relating to corruption. In February 2008, the NAC came under scrutiny when it was alleged that six senior officials, including acting director Romanus Pakure had misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars intended for the country's fight against AIDS. The misappropriation involved falsification of purchase orders, including a stationery order of US$361,000 that never arrived, and officials using money to go on overseas trips. Pakure, along with the other five senior executives, was suspended pending an investigation into the matter. At the time, Pakure said he welcomed the investigation but questioned the legality of the suspension because he learnt about it in the media before receiving a letter from the Department of Health. In March 2009, further allegations of misappropriation of funding emerged. At the time, Chairman Sir Peter Barter said that these matters were being investigated internally and he had written to the ministry of finance and other bodies for assistance. These issues of corruption have become a notable hindrance to the country's fight against HIV/AIDS. It was reported in the media in March 2009 that corruption, misappropriation and mismanagement were responsible for two million condoms being left in a warehouse in Port Moresby until well after their expiry dates. The NAC subsequently underwent a restructuring exercise in order to rid the council of corruption and poor management, which involved the sacking of several employees. In 2011, Wep Kanawi and an Australian adviser to the NAC were, separately, physically attacked as a result of their involvement in the fight against corruption.

In some regions of the Philippines, particularly Bicol and Visayas, Sirenas are known as Magindara and portrayed as vicious mermaids. Unlike Sirens of Greek mythology, who are portrayed as women/bird creatures, Sirenas are often portrayed as mermaid-like creatures who live under the sea. In Philippine mythology, the Sirena is a mythological aquatic creature with the head and torso of a human female and the tail of a fish. The Sirena is an Engkanto ‚Äì' the Filipino counterpart of English mermaids. Engkantos are classified as one of the Bantay Tubig, a Filipino term for mythical guardians of the water. In addition to the Sirena, other examples of Bantay Tubig are Siyokoy, Kataw and Ugkoy. The male version of a Sirena is called a Sireno. Sometimes Sirena are paired with Siyokoy. A popular mermaid character in the Philippines is Dyesebel.  Behavior  The Sirena has a beautiful and enchanting voice that can attract and hypnotize males, especially fishermen. Sirena sing to sailors and enchant them, distracting them from their work and causing them to walk off ship decks or cause shipwrecks. They sing with enchanting voices while hiding among the rocks by the shore. When the men hear these songs they are hypnotized and are abducted by the Sirena. Some folk traditions claim that the Sirena carry their victims under the sea, sacrificing them to the water deities. Other stories claim that the Sirena pretend to need rescuing from drowning, luring men into the sea, but proceed to squeeze the life out of any man who falls prey to their hoax. A malevolent Sirena may tease and attract human males with its spellbinding songs. Occasional reports had Sirena grabbing seemingly hypnotized humans and drowning them or taking them under water. Another view had the tempted human chasing the Sirena into deep water until he drowned or that he had a heart attack upon seeing such an Engkanto and toppled into the water to his death. When a mermaid falls in love with a human she or he becomes tame and obedient to the human. Dugongs, sea turtles, and small cetaceans such as dolphins usually accompany the Sirena. Appearance  Sirena are beautiful sea creatures with the upper body of a human with long, flowing hair that is often curly or wavy and the lower body of a fish or has a tail of a fish. In pre-Hispanic Philippines they were believed to be beautiful. Folklore Many Pangasinan myths describe Sirena who drown fishermen and warriors who worship Apo laki. In some stories they are guardians of the waters of \\"asin-palan\\", shielding it from the tattooed raiders from the Visayas. In Pre-colonial Philippines, it was believed that in the full moon or in the Dayaw or Kadayawan, one of the embodiments of the moon who is Bulan descended from the heavens to swim with the mermaids and that the mermaids protected the boy moon from sea monsters. Popular culture Marina was a fantasy series that features a mermaid. It aired on February 23, 2004 to November 12, 2004, starring Claudine Barretto. The first TV series adaptation of Dyesebel was broadcast on GMA Network in 2008. It originally aired on April 28, 2008 and ended on October 17, 2008, completing 125 episodes. It starred Marian Rivera and Dingdong Dantes in the lead roles. Cindy Kurlteto was originally cast as Dyesebel. A second Dyesebel adaptation was broadcast on ABS-CBN played by Anne Curtis.

Ukraine has one of the highest rates of increase of HIV/AIDS cases in Eastern Europe and highest HIV prevalence outside Africa. Experts estimated in August 2010 that 1.3 percent of the adult population of Ukraine was infected with HIV, the highest in all of Europe. Late 2011 Ukraine numbered 360,000 HIV- positive persons (increase in the rate close to zero compared with 2010).On World AIDS Day, a dose of good news, Kyiv Post (1 December 2011) Between 1987 and late 2012 27,800 Ukrainians died of AIDS. In 2012 tests revealed 57 new cases of HIV positive Ukrainians each day and 11 daily AIDS-related deaths (on a population of roughly 45 million at the time).Ukraine, CIA Factbook (page last updated on November 14, 2012) Identified in the Ukrainian SSR in 1987, HIV/AIDS appeared to be confined to a small population until the mid-1990s, when a sudden and explosive epidemic emerged among injecting drug users and prostitutes against the background of severe economic crisis and collapse of social healthcare system. According to data reported in 2015 the epidemic is still on the rise, but it doesn't limit itself by a small group of drug users and appears to be accelerated within all parts of Ukrainian population with growing numbers of infected women. Ukraine has one of the highest rates of increase of HIV/AIDS cases in Eastern Europe and highest adult HIV prevalence outside Africa. Situation Spread of AIDS HIV officially reached the territory of the former Soviet Union in 1987, about 5 years after the virus itself was discovered. Until 1995 there were only a few known cases of HIV infections in Ukraine. The country was therefore deemed to be ‚Äúlow risk‚Äù by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in terms of spread at that time.L. Burruano und J. Seydel Die Ausbreitung von HIV/AIDS in der Ukraine. Gesundheitswesen 2006;68, 8-9, 571-574, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart. ISSN 0941-3790 Between 1987 and 1994, 183 infections were reported. In the mid-1990s, the transmission was primarily through injecting drug use. By 2001, however, the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use had declined to 57% from 84% in 1997. During that time, heterosexual transmission increased from 11% to 27%, and perinatal transmission increased from 2% to 13% as a proportion of total cases. Registered HIV prevalence in Ukraine (late 2007) UNAIDS estimates that the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS in 2003 was 360,000 (range 180,000 to 590,000), representing an adult prevalence of 1.4%. According to the Ministry of Health‚Äîwhich estimates that by 2002 there were more than 500,000 people infected or nearly 2% of the adult population‚Äîthe epidemic has now spread to every oblast in the country. Prevalence in the southern and eastern oblasts (Odessa, Mykolaiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk) is about three times higher than rates in the rest of the country. A major reason for this is the fact that the urbanized and industrialized regions in the East and South of Ukraine suffered most from the economic crisis in the 90s, which in turn led to the spread of unemployment, alcoholism, and drug abuse, thus setting the conditions for wider spread of the epidemic.Vulnerability Assessment of People Living With HIV (PLHIV) in Ukraine United Nations Development Programme, page 24 - Retrieved on 8 December 2009. From 1995 to 2007, the primary means of HIV transmission was through injection drug use, but by 2008, sexual contact outpaced injection drug use as the primary form of transmission. By 2009, almost 44 percent of new infections occurred through sexual transmission, and 36 percent were through injecting drug use (according to USAID; according to CSIS in 2009 the proportion of new cases of HIV/AIDS attributable to injecting drug use was 60%).Injecting Drug Use in Ukraine, Center for Strategic and International Studies (March 2012). In 2007 about 0.96 percent of Ukrainians, or about 440,000 citizens, were estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS,http://www.unaids.org/en/KnowledgeCentre/HIVData/mapping_progress.asp down from 1.46 percent of the population in 2005, or 685,600 citizens, according to UNAIDS. The number of HIV/AIDS cases in Ukraine reduced by 200 or 3.9% to 4,900 in the period of January‚ÄìNovember 2008, compared with the corresponding period of last year.In 2007 the majority of those infected where under 30 years of age; with a full 25% of those affected still in their teens. Although HIV/AIDS had remained concentrated among marginalized and vulnerable populations, it was feared in 2008 it may be spreading to the general population. According to the Ministry of Health, Ukraine has already surpassed the ‚Äúoptimistic‚Äù projections of an HIV/AIDS rate of 2% in 2010.\\"Health Profile: Ukraine\\". United States Agency for International Development (December 2004). Retrieved 7 September 2008. According to the Health Ministry of Ukraine the HIV infection rate fell by 6.7% and mortality from AIDS was down by 7.9% in 2014. Number of HIV infection cases in Ukraine down by almost 7% since early 2014, says health ministry, Interfax-Ukraine (3 December 2014) HIV travel restrictions: WWW.PLHIV.ORG Prisons Between 1996 and 2001 about 26 percent in various prisons across Ukraine tested HIV- positive. In a January 2005 study between 15 and 30 percent of prisoners tested HIV- positive. Early 2005 rates of up to 95 percent of the prisoners were found Hepatitis C positive.HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C in prisons: the facts , AIDSLEX (2006) Retrieved 1 April 2010. Early 2010 there were over 147,000 people held at prisons and more than 38,000 at pre-trial detention facilities in Ukraine. Spread of AIDS among children The number of children with AIDS in Ukraine is on the rise since the number of mothers with HIV grows by 20-30% annually. According to the United Nations, the number of pregnant women with HIV was 0.34% in 2007, which was the highest index in Europe. According to the United Nations, of nearly 18,000 children born by HIV-positive mothers in Ukraine, 10,200 children have not contracted HIV and another 5,500 children under eighteen months have yet to receive final results of an examination. In Ukraine, 1,877 children have been confirmed as HIV positive and 244 have died of AIDS. The United Nations notes that the program of preventing mother-to- child transmission of HIV in Ukraine has cut the share of such transmission from 27% of the number of HIV cases in 2000 to 7% in 2006. According to the Health Ministry of Ukraine the HIV transmission from mother to a child was 4.28% in 2014 compared to 29% in 2004. The spread of HIV among the Ukrainian street children attracted a lot of special research interest due to their risky way of life. According to the obtained data around 15.5% of street minors in Ukraine used the injected drugs at least once, 9.8% of boys reported anal sex experience when only 36% of them acknowledged using condom during their most recent sexual encounter. Preventive measures From 2001 till June 2015 HIV-positive Ukrainian citizens were barred from travelling abroad and HIV-positive foreigners were forbidden to enter Ukraine. Harm reduction programs An ambulance in Kiev Since 2003, drug substitution programs have been introduced in Ukraine. By the end of September 2008, they were offered to about 2200 persons in 38 locations. Mostly Buprenorphine (Trademark ‚ÄòSubutex‚Äò) is dispensed, which is significantly more expensive than Methadon. It is also less frequently used and thoroughly researched worldwide. Buprenophin is more accepted by society and politicians, however, because it is seen as a painkiller. Methadone, in contrast, is viewed as a drug subscribed at public expense.C. Weber Assessment 2007 in Donetsk. http://www.aids-ukraine.org. In 2012 patients and advocacy groups complained of occasional supply shortages in Ukrainian AIDS clinics. In June 2012 advocacy groups accused Health Ministry officials of embezzling money that should be used to treat AIDS patients by buying AIDS drugs at hugely inflated prices and then receiving kickbacks.Ukraine:Corruption blamed for AIDS non-treatment, Associated Press (29 June 2012) In the War in Donbass the separatist authorities of the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic have banned methadone and substitution therapy and have taken a hard line on drug addiction and have banned most international medical organizations. As a result people living with HIV/AIDS fled separatist-controlled areas. National response The policy and legal environment in Ukraine is generally favorable for combating the spread of HIV/AIDS, but there is a gap between national-level policies and laws and local-level practices. The National AIDS Committee was established in 1992 but was dissolved in 1998 because of budget disputes. In 1999, the government created the National AIDS Control Coordinating Council under the Cabinet and mandated that all regions establish HIV prevention programs. In 2001, a national plan for combating HIV/AIDS was approved; its goals included preventing the further spread of HIV, developing the capacity to treat infected individuals, and providing social support and counseling for those living with HIV/AIDS. Although the HIV/AIDS law is one of the most progressive in the region, the government still treats HIV/AIDS primarily as a medical issue. Prevention activities have been largely funded by international organizations. Because HIV testing is limited to government facilities, those at greatest risk are not being reached, since marginalized populations are the least likely to use government facilities. Stigma by the medical profession against persons living with HIV/AIDS is a major barrier to accessing information and services. The first Ukrainian advocate group of/for Ukrainian AIDS patients was launched on December 10, 2010. Statistics Note: all statistics till late 2007.

He is best known for his contribution of Khmaladze transformation in statistics. Biography Estate Khmaladze was born October 20, 1944, Tbilisi, Georgia. He graduated from Tbilisi State University in 1966, where the first three years he was studying physics. He finished his PhD in 1971 at V. A. Steklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow, under supervision of L. N. Bolshev, who was head of department of mathematical statistics at Steklov after N. V. Smirnov. From 1972 until 1990, his work was, mostly, split between V. A. Steklov Institute, Moscow, and A. Razmadze Mathematical Institute, Tbilisi. From 1990 to 1999, he was appointed head of department of probability theory and mathematical statistics of A. Razmadze Mathematical Institute of Georgian Academy of Science. In 1996, Khmaladze moved with his family from Tbilisi, Georgia, to Sydney, Australia, and from there to Wellington, New Zealand, where in 2002 he was appointed Professor of Statistics after retirement of his predecessor, David Vere-Jones. A characteristic feature of Khmaladze's work is the search of connection between distant analytical topics. For example, in Khmaladze (1993), the connections between the theory of spatial martingales and Volterra operators with goodness of fit problems of statistics was demonstrated, and in Khmaladze(2007), the infinitesimal theory for set-valued functions was extended to help with problems of spatial statistics and image analysis. However, the majority of his mathematical research centers around empirical processes and distribution- free methods of testing statistical hypothesis. Considerable amount of Khmaladze's work is in applications of statistics, in the fields of cito- genetics, physiology, demography and insurance, statistical analysis of texts, various problems in economics and finance. His current applied interests are focused around statistical theory of diversity and Zipf's law.

In that year he was made an esquire (√©cuyer tranchant) by Philip the Good. He rapidly gained the confidence of the duke and was entrusted with a series of important missions. In 1423 he was honoured with the title premier √©cuyer tranchant, \\"first esquire\\". From February 1432 to the middle of 1433 Bertrandon undertook his pilgrimage to the Mideast. Upon his return he was treated to more honours. In 1442 Philip arranged for Bertrandon to marry Catherine, daughter of Jean de Bernieulles, one of the richest heiresses of the Artois, and in 1443 he granted Bertrandon the captaincy of the castle of Rupelmonde on the left bank of the Escaut, a strategic fortress. In 1452 Bertrandon was present with Philip at the Battle of Gavere against the rebels of Ghent. In July 1453 he was among the elite lords present in the ducal tent when the conditions of peace were imposed on Ghent. The last mention of Bertrandon in contemporary records dates from 1455, when Philip coaxed him to compose some memoirs of his expedition to the east. A finished copy of these was given to Philip in 1457. One of the manuscripts of the Voyage records that Bertrandon died at Lille on 9 May 1459 and was buried in the collegiate church of Saint-Pierre.

Ghent to Venice Bertrandon de la Broqui√®re left Ghent in February 1432. He took the route through Champagne and Burgundy to Italy. He first went to Rome, where he was received by Pope Eugene IV. On 25 March he set out from Rome for Venice, where he embarked on a galley bound for Jaffa on 8 May. The ship was loaded with pilgrims, many of them Burgundians. This part of the voyage is largely ignored in his memoires. He provides only brief descriptions of the Italian cities he passed through on his way to the sea. Holy Land After several stops at Venetian ports, in the Morea, on Corfu, on Rhodes and Cyprus, Bertrandon reached Jaffa. There he was forced to pay a tribute to the Egyptian sultan, the usual demand on pilgrims.Thomas Johnes (ed.), The Travels of Bertrandon de La Brocqui√®re (Hafod Press, 1807). From Jaffa he moved towards Jerusalem, which took two days. Probably he behaved as a regular pilgrim at the time, though he was also on a mission of observation. He saw the image of the Notre Dame de Sardenay (·π¢aidnƒÅyƒÅ), but called the healing oil supposedly sweating from it a \\"mere trick to get money\\", noting that both Christian and Saracen were devoted to the image.Philip Khuri Hitti (1985), \\"The Impact of the Crusades on Moslem Lands\\", The Impact of the Crusades on the Near East, N. P. Zacour and Harry W. Hazard, edd. A History of the Crusades, vol. V, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 42. His stay in Jerusalem was short, after which he moved south to Gaza. There he and ten companions made preparations to cross the desert, despite the heat and the brigands, to visit the Saint Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai. Though Bertandon fell ill and had to turn back to Gaza, he does record the sighting of several exotic desert animals in his Voyage. In Gaza he was nursed back to health by some Arabs, whom he admits in his Voyage were not as bad as often portrayed in Europe. They conducted him to Mount Zion, where he was placed in the care of the Conventual Franciscans. He wished to continue to visit the sites of the Holy Land, but on account of the political situation could not. He took an Arab ship from Jaffa to Beirut and there joined a mule team headed for Damascus. In Damascus met the French merchant Jacques Coeur and a Genoese merchant from Caffa who was working for Barsbay, Sultan of Egypt, to purchase slaves for his mameluke ranks.Aziz S. Atiya (1975), \\"The Aftermath of the Crusades\\", The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, Harry W. Hazard, ed. A History of the Crusades, vol. III, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 649-650. Damascus to Constantinople From Damascus he returned to Beirut, where he attended a nocturnal Arab festival that made a strong impression on him. He does, however, report the decline of Beirut, that Jaffa was nothing but a collection of tents covered in reeds, and that Acre had only 300 houses.Hitti, p. 57. In Beirut he decided to return to Europe by land, though pilgrims of the time usually took a boat back to Italy. At Damascus he had negotiated with the leader of a caravan, Kodja Barqouq, making its way from Mecca to Bursa. On the condition that he wear the Turkish costume, so as not to endanger his fellow travellers, he was permitted to accompany the caravan. The riches from Mecca greatly impressed him. In the caravan Bertrandon met and befriended a mameluke, who taught him aspects of Turkish culture, cuisine and military custom. He also learned the rudiments of the Turkish language. The caravan stopped first in Antioch, crossed Little Armenia, and rounded the gulf of Alexandretta. The voyage across Asia Minor was relatively fast. At Iconium Bertrandon took leave of the caravan and joined an embassy headed to the Beylik of Karaman. When he finally arrived in Bursa, he took up lodging with a local Florentine for ten days. At Bursa he joined a company of European merchants, a Spaniard and three Florentines, and followed them to Pera. 1422 map of Constantinople (Pera at top) by Florentine cartographer Cristoforo Buondelmonte In Constantinople he took up with a Catalan merchant. The description of the city in his Voyage contains some interesting accounts of a joust and other ceremonies he attended, but very little on the city's architecture. He records a low opinion of the Emperor John VIII, describing him as an impotent tributary of the Ottoman sultan. Constantinople to Burgundy Bertrandon left Constantinople on 23 January 1433 in the company of Benedict Folco of Forl√¨, the ambassador of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, heading to the court of the Ottoman sultan Murad II at Adrianople, where they arrived late in February. Bertrandon records in his Voyage the sumptuous reception accorded the ambassador. On 12 March Bertrandon and Benedict left Adrianople. They visited Macedonia, Bulgaria, Albania, and Bosnia. He also visited Serbia and was well received by despot George Brankovic. Bertrandon records in his Voyage of this time that he found the Turks more friendly than Greeks. He and Benedict arrived in Belgrade on 12 April. It was there that Bertrandon began to think strategically about the conquest of the Ottoman Empire. He describes Turkish armies, armour, administration, and military system. In his Voyage he presents a plan to unite England, France, and Germany against the Turks. He says the conquest would be easy, but it is the Greeks--not the Turks--who do not trust the Westerners; the possibility of an alliance with the Greeks is slim.Deno Geanakoplos (1975), \\"Byzantium and the Crusades, 1354-1453\\", The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries, Harry W. Hazard, ed. A History of the Crusades, vol. III, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), p. 98. Murad, he writes, could conquer Europe with his resources, but he includes a copy of the report of the Venetian John Torcello in his Voyage, to buttress his claim that the Westerners are better armed.Halil Inalcik (1989), \\"The Ottoman Turks and the Crusades, 1329-1451\\", The Impact of the Crusades on Europe, N. P. Zacour and Harry W. Hazard, edd. A History of the Crusades, vol. VI, Kenneth M. Setton, gen. ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 268 and 275. He and Benedict then traversed the Great Hungarian Plain and stopped in Buda, where they parted ways. It took Bertrandon five days to get to Vienna from Buda, and there he was cordially welcomed by Duke Albert V of Austria, cousin of Philip the Good. Albert presented him with the first opposition to his plans. From Vienna Bertrandon took six days to arrive at Linz. He took the route through Bavaria and Swabia to Basel, where he attended a meeting of the Council of Basel. He reentered Burgundy at Montb√©liard. At the abbey of Pothi√®res in the C√¥te d'Or early in July he reported to Philip the Good. He gave him a copy of the Koran and a life of Mohammed translated into Latin by the chaplain of the Venetian consul at Damascus. He also gave him his clothes and his horse, both acquired from the East. The duke gave the Koran and the vita to bishop John Germain, the chancellor of the Order of the Golden Fleece, but kept the robes.

Although Cambodia is one of the poorest countries in the world, extensive HIV prevention and control efforts by the Royal Government of Cambodia and its partners have helped to reduce the spread of HIV. Between 2003 and 2005, the estimated HIV prevalence among Cambodian adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 2.0 percent to 1.6 percent.  Dynamics  Cambodia‚Äôs HIV/AIDS epidemic is spread primarily through heterosexual transmission and revolves largely around the sex trade. HIV transmission occurs mainly in sexual partnerships where one partner has engaged in high-risk behaviors. Women constitute a growing share of people living with HIV/AIDS, comprising an estimated 47 percent of people living with HIV/AIDS in 2003, compared with 37 percent in 1998. This increased proportion of infections among women may reflect declining prevalence rates among males, as well as deaths among males infected in the early years of Cambodia‚Äôs epidemic. Significantly, a low prevalence rate in the general population masks far higher prevalence rates in certain sub-populations, such as injecting drug users, people in prostitution, men who have sex with men, karaoke hostesses and beer girls, and mobile and migrant populations.\\"2008 Country Profile: Cambodia\\" .

In the general population, the prevalence declined to 0.5 percent in 2009, down from 1.2 percent in 2001. The prevalence of HIV infection among women visiting antenatal care (ANC) clinics also declined, from a high of 2.1 percent in 1999 to 1.1 percent in 2006. Among HIV-infected pregnant women, there was also a gradual increase in the percentage who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission, from 1.2 percent in 2003 to 11.2 percent in 2007 to 32.3 percent in 2009.

With an estimated 150,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in 2016 (or an approximately 2.1 percent prevalence rate among adults aged 15‚Äì49), Haiti has the most overall cases of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean and its HIV prevalence rates among the highest percentage-wise in the region. There are many risk factors groups for HIV infection in Haiti, with the most common ones including lower socioeconomic status, lower educational levels, risky behavior, and lower levels of awareness regarding HIV and its transmission. However, HIV prevalence in Haiti is largely dropping as a result of a strong AIDS/HIV educational program, support from non- governmental organizations and private donors, as well as a strong healthcare system supported by UNAIDS. Part of the success of Haiti's HIV healthcare system lies in the governmental commitment to the issue, which alongside the support of donations from the Global Fund and President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), allows the nation to prioritize the issue. Despite the extreme poverty afflicting a large Haitian population, the severe economic impact HIV has on the nation, and the controversy surrounding how the virus spread to Haiti and the United States, Haiti is on the path to provide universal treatment, with other developing nations emulating its AIDS treatment system.  History  AIDS in Haitians was first recognized in 34 Haitians living in the United States in 1982, and in the same year eleven individuals in Haiti were suspected to be HIV infected. Since the majority of these individuals did not fall into the classic risk factor groups, Haitians were classified as a separate risk factor group, causing damage to Haiti's image and economy and affecting tourism. In the same year, the Haitian Study Group on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) was formed to study the new epidemic. GHESKIO used retrospective diagnosis to conclude that from 1979 to 1982, there were 61 cases of AIDS in Haiti. Through various studies and analyses, GHESKIO concluded that the risk factors identified in the 61 individuals were no different from those in other countries, with the primary risk factor being the fact that most of the patients lived in the suburb of Carrefour where prostitution was prevalent. The stigmatization of Haiti, however, continued, and during the presidency of Jean-Claude Duvalier, it was illegal to mention AIDS/HIV in Haiti. From 1983 to 1987, the virus spread quickly through the population mostly through heterosexual sex, as HIV infected cases attributed to homosexuals or bisexuals went down from 50% to less than 1%. In a 1985 to 2000 study, the virus spread twice as fast in developed nations prior to the use of antiretrovirals, as malnutrition, infectious communities, and active tuberculosis were all prevalent in Haiti. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the first democratically elected President of Haiti, was the first Haitian president to include HIV/AIDS into his platform for his 2001‚Äì2004 presidency and initiated governmental policies to ensure the blood supply remains uncontaminated and to prevent and treat the virus amongst the population.  Prevalence  In Haiti, the three groups where HIV/AIDS is most prevalent are men who have sex with men, sex workers, and prisoners, with prevalence rates of 18.2, 8.4, and 4.3 respectively. As opposed to the United States, intravenous drug use in Haiti was more rare and the blood supply was not initially affected by HIV infected individuals. As such, intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs were never major risk factor groups in Haiti since the start of the epidemic. As of 2017, UNAIDS, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, reports that HIV in Haiti is most prevalent among adults aged 15 to 49 and is primarily transmitted through heterosexual contact and mother-to- infant transmission. The recent declines in HIV infection rates are most notable in urban areas, and have been attributed to significant behavioral changes, including decreased number of partners, decreased sexual debut, and increased condom use. Other explanations for the recent trends include AIDS- related mortality and improvements made in blood safety early in the epidemic. However, continued political instability, high internal migration rates, high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, and weakened health and social services persist as factors with potential negative impacts on the epidemic.  Risk factors  According to a 2010 study, one major risk factor for HIV infection in Haiti, especially in women, is lower socioeconomic status. In rural Haitian populations where education levels for women are low and many women are economically dependent on their husbands, a correlation between the stability of the occupation of the husband and HIV prevalence in the wives is observed. Women whose husbands are market vendors or mechanics are at a higher risk of HIV infection. On the contrary, the wives of farmers, a more stable occupation, have a 60% lower risk of HIV infection. Other indicators of low socioeconomic status, like the use of charcoal for cooking and food insecurity also show correlation with higher HIV infection rates in women. The study stipulates that low socioeconomic status and high rates of HIV infection may be connected to the use of transactional sex as an economic survival strategy, a behavior shown in a related South African study to increase HIV infection rates by 1.5 times. Similar trends from related studies have also been seen in other developing nations with gender disparities, such as Malawi, Rwanda, Kenya, Ghana, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and Uganda. Another vulnerable group is adolescents and young adults. For females, risk factor groups include those who have low levels of education, live away from their parents, have been married, or have had a child. For males, factors indicative of HIV infection are intravenous drug use and sexual debut with an unknown individual. For both genders, young adults who are less aware of HIV and its transmission through risky behavior are more likely to be infected, and amongst females, those who talked more openly about HIV infection and testing were less likely to be infected. Finally, having sexual contact with unfaithful partners, having an STI, especially syphilis, and not using condoms are all additional risk factors that affect both genders.  Economic impact  On the national level, HIV causes damage to the Haitian economy because the individuals most affected by the epidemic are the young adults that contribute the most to the country's economy. At the start of the epidemic, Haiti's tourism and export industries suffered when Haitians were classified as an HIV risk group. According to Jean Pape, the head of the largest Haitian HIV research center, Haitian products could no longer be sold in the US and tourism, which was the basis of the Haitian economy, declined drastically. With 54% of the Haiti economy based on the service and tourism sector, HIV further weakened Haiti's already struggling economy. On a household level, HIV causes significant economic strain to the family of infected individuals. HIV infection in a parent can lead to the loss of one source of income which in turn leads to malnutrition, lack of access to education for the children, and increased risk of child labor. The cost of healthcare is another burden on the family. From a 1997 study involving 600 households from C√¥te d'Ivoire, Burundi, and Haiti, households with at least one HIV infected family member spent nearly twice the amount on healthcare (around 10.6%) compared to families without HIV infected individuals, decreasing household consumption in other areas. The HIV treatment also on average took up 80% of the entire family's healthcare budget. Even after the death of the HIV infected individual, the household never completely returned to its original level of consumption.  HIV treatment and prevention  Nearly 75% of HIV treatment in Haiti is sponsored and overseen by the NGOs Partners In Health and Haitian Study Group on Kaposi's Sarcoma and Opportunistic Infections (GHESKIO) in collaboration with the Haitian Ministry of Health. Alongside them, the Joint United Nations Team on AIDS (Joint Team) in Haiti also helps provide the resources to tackle HIV through prevention, treatment, and testing, accelerating the nationwide HIV response. As of 2016, around 55% of HIV positive Haitians received antiretroviral therapy.  Elimination of mother to child transmission  Prior to the efforts to eliminate vertical transmission of HIV, around 27% of babies born to HIV infected mothers in Haiti contracted the virus from their mothers through breast milk. As a preventative measure, GHESKIO and the Ministry of Health set up national guidelines for HIV infected mothers and newborn babies to receive doses of zidovudine. Since 2003, Haiti has altered its guidelines to allow triple drug ART for pregnant HIV infected women, treatments for existing opportunistic infections, and counseling on the use of formula feed instead of breast milk to lower transmission rates. Since the use of triple therapy, HIV transmission rates from mother to child for those on triple drug ART has decreased to around 1.9%, while the transmission rates among all pregnant women treated for HIV in any form has dropped to 9.2%, both of which are significant decreases from the initial 27% vertical transmission. The Joint Team and UNICEF also provides manuals on preventing mother to child transmission of HIV and offers prenatal and postpartum counseling services to HIV infected mothers to stem vertical transmission in Haiti. However, further educational efforts are necessary as only around 40% of Haitian HIV infected mothers attend these counseling services, and an even smaller amount get tested for HIV prior to childbirth. Around 80% of Haitians recognize that the virus can be transmitted vertically, however, the majority of Haitians do not know that treatment of both the mother and child in the weeks before and after childbirth can greatly decrease the risk of infection in the baby. This coupled with the fact that around 80% of childbirth in Haiti takes place at home instead of in a hospital necessitates that further connection of HIV infected individuals with the health networks in Haiti is essential to stem vertical transmission.  HIV Equity Initiative  In 1985, Paul Farmer and his colleagues created a clinic in the Central Plateau of Haiti to serve those displaced by the creation of a hydroelectric dam. The first case of HIV recorded at this clinic was in 1986. In 1987, Farmer spearheaded the effort that lead to the founding of Partners in Health. After a 1994 paper detailing the effects of AZT on lowering the rates of transmission from mother to child, the HIV clinic began offering HIV testing and antiretroviral therapy to pregnant mothers, leading to a sharp decline of cases of mother to child transmission. Starting in 1997, the clinic made post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) available to women who suffered from rape and HIV health workers who had occupation injuries. In late 1998, individuals with long term severe opportunistic infections were offered antiretroviral therapy as opposed to only being allowed to treat their symptoms for free. For those infected with the more life-threatening tuberculosis, anti-tuberculous therapy was prioritized over ART. Partners in Health's success largely comes from the directly observed therapy that is given to the patients, through health care workers known as accompagnateurs. Accompagnateurs help the therapy process by making sure the pills are taken on time, answering questions and concerns, and offering moral support to patients and their families. The clinic also assists the family by offering social services such as payment of tuition and highly attended meetings for patients to stay involved in the treatment process. The success of the program in Haiti served as a model to other developing nations that, despite high unemployment, low GDP per capita, and high HIV prevalence, a nation can have a successful HIV treatment program, regardless of urbanization and wealth.  HIV prevention  HIV prevention has been brought about, especially in the younger generation, through education and the spreading of awareness of safe sex practices and condom use. The Joint Team, in 2016, has collaborated with the Ministry of Education to create health clubs and programs in 100 schools as well as trained 566 educators, supplied over a million condoms, hosted more than 7000 HIV tests, and referred more than 80% of infected individuals from those tests to seek treatment. UNICEF also sponsored efforts to create a video series and a Facebook page targeted towards the 15‚Äì35 age group to spread awareness about the risks of HIV and measures to prevent transmission.  Challenges  After the devastation caused by the 2010 Haitian Earthquake, Haiti's HIV treatment system was affected greatly. Estimates by the Haitian government indicate that around 40% of the initial 24,000 Haitians lost access to antiretrovirals after the earthquake. HIV positive individuals displaced due to the earthquake often live in substandard conditions in tent cities, decreasing their immunity and increasing their susceptibility to infection or progressing to AIDS. The large concentration of HIV positive individuals in confined tent cities also increases the risk of HIV transmission within the smaller community of individuals. However, the overall structure of the HIV treatment system has largely remained intact and the majority of HIV infected patients continue to receive access to antiviral therapy while the nation rebuilds the rest of its healthcare system. Other challenges to the HIV treatment and prevention efforts in Haiti include more recent events, such as Hurricane Matthew, the cholera outbreak, and additional refugees arriving from the Dominican Republic, the limitations on the human and financial resources the NGOs can provide, and the fluctuating level of cooperation from the Haitian government.  The Haitian connection controversy  The Haitian connection controversy refers to the debate regarding the origins of the HIV virus in Haiti and the United States and whether or not HIV was spread into the US by Haitians or into Haiti by Americans. The controversy began in the 1982, when the CDC noted that 34 cases of immunodeficient patients were Haitian. This \\"connection\\" noted by physicians caused the erroneous labeling of Haitians as a risk factor group for HIV, leading to the rise of the term \\"the 4-H's\\" referring to Homosexuals, Hemophiliacs, Heroin addicts, and Haitians as the major groups prone to HIV infection. Dr. Jacques P√©pin, a Quebecer author of The Origins of AIDS, stipulated that Haiti was one of HIV's entry points to the United States. In July 1960, when Belgian Congo gained independence, the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium. By 1962, Haitians made up the second largest group of well-educated experts in the country totaling around 4500. One of them may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s. P√©pin argues that its spread in Haiti was sped by poor Haitians in need of money selling their blood plasma at centers such as Hemo-Caribbean, which was known to have poor hygienic practices. Plasma centers separated plasma from blood cells and failed to change needles and tubing between patients, a practice that rapidly spreads blood-borne diseases. Luckner Cambronne, co-owner of Hemo-Caribbean and known as the \\"Vampire of the Caribbean\\", was notorious for selling Haitian blood and cadavers abroad for medical uses. Plasma from Hemo-Caribbean was exported to the United States at a maximum rate of 5,000 to 6,000 litres per month in the early 1970s. In his 1990 book \\"AIDS and Accusation,\\" Paul Farmer refutes the idea that Haiti was an HIV entry point to the USA. Referencing an epidemiological study on the prevalence of sarcomas associated with HIV/AIDS contraction, Farmer suggests that Cambronne's plasma business occurred before identifiers of HIV infection were recorded in Haiti, indicating that the disease did not arrive in Haiti until at least the late-1970s. Farmer instead argues that HIV/AIDS in Haiti was introduced by visitors from the US. In a 2007 study, 5 HIV isolates from different regions were compared on the molecular level. By comparing the number of mutations present in different strands of HIV found from patients from Central Africa, the United States, and Haiti, the results predict that the Haitian strain of the virus is the genetic midpoint between the strains found in Central Africa and the United States, and that the virus traveled from Haiti to the United States about 3 years after it reached Haiti. However, this study is refuted by Jean Pape as a continuation of decades old prejudice against Haiti in regards to the AIDS epidemic, as the study does not provide conclusive evidence that the virus traveled from Haiti to the US. Regardless of origin, the consequences of HIV/AIDS in Haiti were severe. The disease spread rapidly throughout Haiti, infecting thousands. Haiti's burgeoning tourist industry suffered greatly from the association with HIV/AIDS, and Haitians living in the USA were placed on the banned list for blood donations, alongside homosexuals and intravenous drug users, until 1990.

Reporting HIV prevalence data in Vietnam is based primarily on HIV/AIDS case reporting and on the HIV Sentinel Surveillance conducted annually in 40 of Vietnam‚Äôs 64 provinces. The government now reports HIV cases in all provinces, 93 percent of all districts, and 49 percent of all communes, although many high prevalence provinces report cases in 100 percent of communes. Even though Vietnam has implemented HIV/AIDS case reporting, the general lack of HIV testing thus far suggests that the actual number of people living with HIV/AIDS is much higher.\\"2008 Country Profile: Vietnam\\". U.S. Department of State (2008). Accessed September 7, 2008. Current State The first HIV case was detected in 1990. The estimated number of people living with HIV then rose drastically from 3,000 in 1992 to 220,000 in 2007, and is projected to be 280,000 in 2012. Among these, 5,670 are children. According to the IMF, this trend is placing Vietnam at the threshold of moving the disease from the high-risk groups of drug users and sex workers to the general population. Among those who inject drugs, 19% are infected by HIV (up to 30% in some provinces.) Major Causes Injection of Drugs Injecting drug users (IDU) account for up to 65% of people living with HIV. The HIV prevalence among male IDU is estimated to be 23.1%. Drug injection is reported as the major cause for doubling the number of HIV/AIDS patients from 2000 to 2005. Although there appears widespread awareness of using sterile needles among IDU (88% reported doing so in the last injection) sharing needles is common among those who have already contracted HIV/AIDS. In a survey of 20 provinces in Vietnam, 35% of IDU living with HIV shared needles and syringes. Besides, IDU often engage in risky sexual behaviours. 25% of male IDU in Hanoi is reported to buy sex and do not use condoms. Meanwhile, female IDU often sell sex to finance their drug need. This raises the risk of spreading HIV/AIDS to the general population. Sexual Transmission Another main cause of HIV/AIDS spread is sexual transmission through the sex workers. While 97.1% of female sex workers (FSW) reported using condoms with their most recent clients, the rate is much lower at 41.1% among those who are living with HIV. Others While HIV/AIDS remain an epidemic only within the high-risk groups, women in the general population may be more exposed to the risk of contracting HIV than reported. One study estimates that reported HIV transmission among women may reflect as low as 16% of the real number due to the lack of HIV screening. The number of women with HIV infection is estimated to increase from less than 30,000 in 2000 to 90,000 in 2007. Women may contract HIV/AIDS through partners who are undisclosed IDU. Men having pre-marital or extra-marital sexual relationships with FSW inevitably expose their wives to HIV/AIDS risk. Particularly in provinces with mobile populations, migrant husbands who, being away from home, are likely buy sex and use drugs may contract HIV and transmit to their wives. With potentially high HIV prevalence among women, perinatal transmission presents another channel of HIV transmission. It is reported that more than 1% of pregnant women in some provinces are found HIV positive. Challenges Social stigma against HIV/AIDS patients presents a major obstacle to contain HIV/AIDS. HIV/AIDS patients are treated unequally in the hospitals and denied employment. Children with HIV are not welcomed in school. In 2009, parents in Ho Chi Minh City forced officials to expel children with HIV. Discrimination thus discourages people to go for screening or to take medication in fear of revealing their HIV status. Funding for HIV/AIDS programmes in Vietnam is another pressing issue limiting the success of the effort to control the disease. Over the past 5 years, the available resource covered merely 50% of the demand. Moreover, since 70% of this amount was received from international institutions while state funding accounted for only 13%, there is no guarantee of future availability. The final challenge lies in the limited human resources. There is a shortage of helpers in provincial and district areas. Currently, there are approximately 1,300 health workers in preventive medicines nationwide, including anti-HIV work, or 21 on average for each city or district. Dr. Nguyen Thanh Long, Chief of the Health Ministry‚Äôs HIV/AIDS Control Department, estimated that Vietnam has to increase the number of health workers to 20,000 by 2020 in order to be able to contain and reduce the increasing number of infected cases.

Paris 18 April 1906, d. 20 May 1968) was a French cycling journalist and author and the founder of the Grand Prix des Nations international time-trial. He is considered, in the French expression, \\"one of the most beautiful pens\\" of sports writing. Pierre Chany a contemporary, called him \\"The best sporting journalist of his generation.\\" Penot, Christophe (1996), Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France, √âditions Cristel, Paris, p40 Biography Albert Baker d'Isy worked at L'√âcho des Sports, a sports newspaper which appeared erratically between 1904 and 1957. In 1934, he became one of its main cycling writers, along with Ren√© de Latour, who was also foreign correspondent of the British monthly, Sporting Cyclist. By that time, he was also writing for the larger daily, Paris-Soir, which he joined in 1931. With Paris-Soir‚Ä≤s sports editor, Gaston B√©nac, he created the Crit√©rium National, a road race limited to French riders, and the Grand Prix des Nations. The Grand Prix began in 1932 to much suspicion among riders, because there had been no tradition of racing against the clock in continental Europe,Chany, Pierre (1982), La Fabuleuse Histoire de cyclisme, Nathan ParisProcycling, UK, August 1999, pp65-69 but the race went on to become the unofficial world time-trial championship.Bicyclist, October 1998 Paris-Soir created both races in competition with L'Auto, the national sports daily which ran the Tour de France. Rivalry between the publications was so intense that Henri Desgrange, the organiser, changed the time of race finishes so to make them too late for Paris-Soir to report. Baker d'Isy and B√©nac got the idea of an international time-trial after watching the world championship road race in Copenhagen in 1931, which unusually had been run that way. The two decided that the novelty would ensure their paper publicity and that running a time- trial would cost less than a conventional road race. Baker d'Isy came up with the name and he and Ren√© de Latour De Latour, Ren√©: Take your bike and find me a course, Sporting Cyclist, UK claim to have found the route. Maurice Archambaud was the first winner. The route started near the Versailles ch√¢teau and ran round a triangle through Rambouillet, Maulette, Saint-R√©my-l√®s- Chevreuse, Versailles and Boulogne to finish on the V√©lodrome Buffalo. There were three hills, one in the first 100 km, plenty of cobbles, and the last 40 km went through the woods of the Vall√©e de Chevreuse, a popular area for bike riders. The distance was 142 km. Baker d'Isy moved after World War II to another Paris evening paper, Ce Soir. He became deputy to Georges Pagnoud in race organisation. Baker d'Isy also wrote for monthly papers, Sports and Miroir, which had been started by the Communist Party.France in the 1950s had a strong communist following and all political sides had their own publications, not all of them markedly political in nature Ce Soir failed and Baker d'Isy joined L'√âquipe, which had taken over from L'Auto.L'Auto, which had been taken over by a German consortium, was closed down after the war. The government sequestrated its property, which included rights to run the Tour de France. L'√âquipe was established by many of L'Auto‚Ä≤s staff but without the original editor, Henri Desgrange, who died at the outbreak of the war. L'√âquipe had to bid for the Tour de France in competition with rival papers. He was fired from L'√âquipe after being sent to report from Egypt. Pierre Chany said: > The problem was that Albert always went that bit too far. When he was fired, > he had just returned from a long reporting tour of Egypt. He had promised 12 > articles but he only ever wrote the first. The paper had announced that the > next 11 instalments were to follow, but they never appeared.

Lilliput area of operations. Operation Lilliput (World War II) was the name given to a convoy operation directed by G.H.Q. Operations Instructions Number 21 of 20 October 1942 for transportation of troops, weapons, and supplies in a regular transport service between Milne Bay and Oro Bay, New Guinea between 18 December 1942 and June 1943 in order \\"to cover reinforcement, supply, and development of the Buna-Gona area upon its anticipated capture\\" by the Australian 7th Division and the United States Army's 32d Division. Within six months, the convoys, escorted by Royal Australian Navy corvettes and largely composed of Dutch KPM merchant ships, had delivered 60,000 tons of supplies and 3,802 troops from Milne Bay to Oro Bay. Corvettes provided the majority of the escort force. Losses during Imperial Japanese air attacks amounted to two merchant ships, and , sunk and two badly damaged while several of the corvettes also sustained damage and casualties. Oro Bay Buna-Gona local map showing Dobodura road terminus. The western terminus of the convoys was Oro Bay some from Milne Bay and noted for its treacherous approaches between Milne Bay and Cape Nelson. The final approach was through a channel from wide and deep. The port area, with a capacity for six to eight ships in an anchorage of about , some from Buna itself, had been used earlier by vessels of the Small Ships Section supporting the campaign. On 14 December 1942, an advance party of the Lilliput Task Force arrived with landing barges in advance of the first U.S. Army controlled KPM vessels , and between 20 and 24 December. Destroyers had been requested as convoy escorts by General Blamey, Commander, Allied Land Forces, but rejected by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender commanding Allied Naval Forces noting the entire area between Cape Nelson and Buna was so filled with reefs that destroyers would be limited in maneuver and not effective against Japanese forces with clear sea room from bases in Rabaul. Further, requirements preliminary to the Guadalcanal operation required fleet units be on standby south of New Guinea. Thus the convoys would only have small, shallow draft warships for escort. A part of the Buna-Gona general plan was development of a deep water port in Oro Bay with a road to be constructed to an airfield to be developed for logistics and as a bomber base at Dobodura. A section of the Oro Bay-Dobodura road. Initial landing operations were carried out under cover of night and construction of the of road between the port and Dobodura Airfield was begun by Australian units later augmented by U.S. Army units and equipment with completion within months. In the meantime, jeeps were used over jungle trails to deliver supplies. Over 50 air raids were experienced in the first six months and construction of wharves were started in mid 1943 as Operation Lilliput itself was coming to a close, and eight docks, some capable of supporting larger ships, were available by the first of August. After the Lilliput convoys ended, the port was developed into a major facility with machine shops, additional large ship dockage, a slipway of logs capable of handling small vessels and by August 1944 a wooden pier capable of supporting four Liberty ships at once. Convoy operations Operation Lilliput was not an isolated operation as in a single landing or convoy series. It grew from very limited and difficult sea transport in support of the Buna campaign, the very serious lack of supplies for that campaign and had a parallel operation, using some of the same ships over essentially the same route. Convoys of similar nature continued after the formal Operation Lilliput stages had officially ended. Small Ships Predecessor Hokitika (S-130), Small Ships Section, United States Army Services of Supply, Southwest Pacific Area (USASOSSWPA), unloading onto barges SB46 and SB74, January 1943, Oro Bay Area. Prior to Lilliput convoy operations, the route had been used, and explored, by the Small Ships Section vessels providing both initial invasion and post invasion logistics support. The route had never been accurately charted and was described by Colonel, later Brigadier General, Thomas B. Wilson, Chief of Transportation, as \\"the most dangerous coastline in the world\\" with the pre-war route for Australian vessels avoiding the route in favor of one by way of Rabaul and the Solomon Sea into the north coast of New Guinea. Some 250 Small Ships vessels had been ordered into Milne Bay in October 1942 for support of the Buna area that had previously only been reached by air. These vessels, described as \\"schooners, motorships, motor launches, cabin cruisers, ketches, trawlers, barges, and miscellaneous vessels, most of which were ancient and rusty. Their Australian crews rigged sails when the engines broke down, and made emergency repairs when the hulls were punctured with bullets or jagged coral\\" had landed elements of the invasion force and provided logistical support‚Äîand \\"moved at night through uncharted waters, marking reefs with empty oil drums and keeping records of observations and soundings, which were later used in charts\\" after hiding in rivers by day. Finding a way The initial luggers and small ships \\"surveying\\" the route as they carried supplies were later augmented by , the 45 ton former examination vessel at Thursday Island,Requisitioned September 1941 and purchased 1 June 1942. The vessel had been intended to land intelligence gathering teams at Rabaul. that began actual surveys to find a reliable approach for larger vessels from Milne Bay to supply troops landed by air near Cape Nelson. In addition to surveys, the vessel was to install lights, land shore parties for reconnaissance, establish radio stations and pilot ships through discovered channels. By the time troops had been airlifted in and secured the area on 5‚Äì6 October Paluma had completed survey of a route and supplies began to arrive by water. By early November, Paluma had found a route for large ships around Cape Nelson whereupon the larger vessels discharged at Porlock with the luggers concentrating on transport forward from there. The hydrographic section in the RAN learned of the local effort and lent assistance with surveys by , and assisting, establishing safe passage for large ships from Milne Bay to Cape Nelson while Paluma worked the route forward to Oro Bay by December making the arrival of tanks possible starting on 11 December 1942 aboard Karsik. Lilliput The urgent need for buildup of logistical support and supplies for the campaign and a base for future operations forced risking larger ships in these hazardous waters. In discussions during the first days of November 1942, New Guinea Force Headquarters decided that cargo vessels would be combat loaded in Australia, proceed to Port Moresby, then Milne Bay and then sent in small \\"flights\\" with an escort and one or two cargo vessels for the dangerous run to Oro Bay. On 15 November, the first large group left Townsville for Port Moresby with nine vessels escorted by the destroyer and corvettes and . Five cargo vessels and Arunta went into Port Moresby with the cargo vessels, Japara, Balikpapan, Bantam and J. B. Ashe escorted by the corvettes going on to Milne Bay for the first run to Buna, but delays in the Buna campaign forced holding of the ships into December with the Port Moresby ships unloading troops and cargo there and returning to Australia. SS Karsik, ex German Soneck impounded in the Netherlands East Indies, was used as a train ferry at Batavia making her suited for transporting tanks to the Allied forces at Buna. The first large vessel to arrive at Oro Bay was Karsik, escorted by , on the night of 11‚Äì12 December 1942 with four Stuart light tanksMayo notes: \\"These tanks, and those following a few days later, had little effect on the battle for Buna; the light, fast Stuarts, slowed by swamp mud choked with kunai grass, were, in the words of the Australian historian of the battle, \\"like race horses harnessed to heavy ploughs\\"; moreover, they were \\"almost blind because tank vision, restricted at the best of times, was shut off by the tropical growth.\\" The fact a large ship had arrived and thus the opening of this supply line is attributed as the real difference made at this point. that were loaded into recently arrived barges and then towed up the coast and landed within miles of the battlefront. Karsik then returned on the 14th with a second load of tanks for the forces at Buna. Karsiks first trip with tanks to Oro Bay was named \\"Operation Karsik\\" and the second as \\"Operation Tramsik\\" and immediately preceded the Lilliput convoys. On 18 December, Japara, under escort of Lithgow, departed in the inauguration of the regular Milne Bay to Oro Bay route, arriving on the 20th, that was with few exceptions run with the Dutch vessels. In the end, most of the KPM vessels of the local fleet had been engaged in the operation. The operation concluded on 17 June 1943 with \\"Stage 40\\", when the U.S. Liberty ship Key Pittman returned to Milne Bay. After Lilliput's official conclusion on 5 July, six similar convoys were run. Concurrent with Lilliput was Operation Accountant, the transport of elements of the 162nd Regiment of the United States 41st Division to Buna-Gona, that involved some of the same ships and escorts. Those were the escorts Ballarat, Bendigo, Echuca and Kapunda and the transports Bontekoe, Karsik and Van Heemskerk. Vessels The Dutch vessels had been acquired through the Netherlands Government in London. Final negotiations between the War Shipping Administration (WSA) and the Dutch government resulted in their being placed under U.S. Army control through a complex charter arrangement in which the British Ministry War Transport (BMWT) chartered the KPM vessels, manned by Dutch officers and Indonesian crew, and jointly with WSA allocated them to the Southwest Pacific Area command's U.S. Army Services of Supply (USASOS) with the stipulation they be under total control of the U.S. Army.

Bantam under Japanese air attack on 28 March 1943. Bantam was unloading at the Oro Bay wharf on 28 March when 18 bombers and 40 fighters struck the port. Her escort, Bowen, was on antisubmarine patrol. Bantam was hit three times and was beached in a badly damaged state and later declared a loss. In the same raid the U.S. Army bareboat chartered ship Masaya, an ex-World War I destroyer and banana boat converted as a fast transport, was hit and sunk to the east. Van Heemskerk is not listed above, but was also part of the original 21 KPM ships joining the SWPA fleet and sunk 14 April 1943. The loss of Van Heemskerk in Milne Bay is noted as the cause for cancellation of one Lilliput convoy. The ship, Stage 28 of Operation Lilliput, was caught in a raid of 30 high altitude bombers, 10 dive bombers and an undetermined number of fighters just after her arrival in the bay and hit by dive bombers to become the last casualty of the operation. Despite efforts of the escort Wagga, fires could not be controlled and the ship blew up. Summary In the early stages, from December 1942 through February 1943, 12 Dutch ships and eight escorts delivered 40,000 tons of supplies and 2,400 troops in 18 individual voyages. Over the total period into mid-June 1943 with 15 corvettes, two American sub chasers and 24 cargo ships involved, the total became 39 voyages (One cancelled when Van Heemskerk was sunk at Milne Bay) transporting 60,000 tons of supplies and 3,802 troops. Several escorts were damaged and suffered personnel casualties. Three of the ships, all KPM vessels, were lost. Others were damaged in air attacks. The original twenty-one KPM ships that formed the core of the early permanent local fleet of the Southwest Pacific Area's marine logistics had paid a price of one seventh of the original ships.The twenty-one original vessels were: Balikpapan (1938), Bantam (1939), Bontekoe (1922), Both (1931), Cremer (1926), Generaal Verspijck (1928), Janssens (1935), Japara (1930), Karsik (1938), Khoen Hoea (1924) (Ship was built for Thong Ek Steamship Co. specifically designed for the Singapore/Pontianak (Borneo) trade and chartered to KPM sometime in 1940.

During graduate school Frank served as a Trooper with the Oregon State Police (OSP). In his final semester of law school he was appointed legal extern to retired United States District Court Judge James Singleton and during the 1970s and 1980s taught justice courses as adjunct faculty for Anchorage Community College.  Government service  In thirteen years of public service to the State of Alaska, Prewitt served as the Director of the Alaska Psychiatric Institute, Commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections and Assistant Alaska Attorney General. When the State of Alaska's only Psychiatric Hospital was at risk of losing accreditation, Governor Walter Hickel appointed Prewitt CEO, relying on his \\"exceptional management skills\\" to successfully re-organize and re-focus the hospital as a provider of quality inpatient and outpatient mental health services.State of Alaska Office of the Governor No. 92-201 09/23/92 Prewitt served under, and at the will of three successive Alaska Governors (Bill Sheffield, Steve Cowper and Walter Hickel). In his final year of public service, editorial writers of Alaska's largest newspaper twice applauded Commissioner Prewitt for his, \\"unusually level-headed approach to the high charged issue of crime‚Ä¶when he argues 'adding police and prosecutors, without giving equal attention to prevention, custody and treatment alternatives may be tough-minded, but it's also soft-headed and fiscally irresponsible.\\" Anchorage Daily News (ADN) Editorial 02/01/94; Anchorage Daily News (ADN) Editorial 08/28/94  Private practice  In 1995 Prewitt established a private consulting and lobbying practice advising and representing human service organizations pursuing business partnerships, outsourcing opportunity, funding, statutory and regulatory changes with Alaska state and local government. From 1998 to 2004 Prewitt was the consulting government affairs and corrections expert for corporate partnerships proposing construction and operation of for-profit correctional facilities in Alaska, Oregon and Washington. The venture rotated through a succession of corporate principals including Allvest Inc, GEO Group (formerly Wackenhut), Cornell Corrections, Chugach Alaska Corporation (Alaska Native Regional Corporation), VECO International, Inc, Kenai Native Association, Neeser Construction and the architectural firms of Koonce Pfeffer Bettis and Livingston-Slone.  Combating political corruption  From 2004 to 2007, Prewitt worked with undercover investigators as an FBI confidential source, exposing Alaska's sub- culture of political corruption. On October 10, 2007 the Anchorage Daily News reported, \\"After court on Thursday, prosecutor Joe Bottini took the unusual step of singling out prosecution witness Frank Prewitt, who has been working undercover for the FBI since 2004‚Ä¶his work helped investigators get the evidence they needed for wiretaps and bugs in Suite 604 of (Juneau's) Baranof Hotel. Bottini said that Prewitt has done a 'tremendous job' for the government, 'we owe him a lot, frankly'.\\" Two of the early private prisons venture partners were caught up in the ongoing Alaska political corruption probe leading to blogger and press speculation that Prewitt's service to the federal government may have been the result of a secret plea agreement although no formal charges were placed. Prewitt contends his participation with the FBI began after he was cleared. He wore a wire to record conversations in meetings with probe targets. Court documents filed on March 22, 2010 in a criminal appeal indicated that Prewitt had been paid $200,000 for his assistance.FBI said to have paid witness $200,000 during corruption probe, Alaska Dispatch News, Lisa Demer, March 23, 2010. Retrieved 8 June 2016. In the trial of ex-Representative Tom Anderson, Prewitt explained how he was willing to go undercover for the feds to try to ease his own criminal exposure in unrelated investigations. Counsel for Anderson, Paul Stockler, said Anderson assisted Cornell, a private prison company, without compensation from the time the investigation was initiated, but it was only after the Hickel administration's former Corrections Commissioner Frank Prewitt, who by then was under investigation himself, made overtures to his client, that he became involved.Alaska corruption trial sent to jury, Juneau Empire, July 9, 2007. Retrieved September 17, 2017.  Criticism  Under cross-examination during the criminal trial of former Alaska Representative Tom Anderson, Prewitt testified that he accepted a $30,000 loan from Bill Weimar in 1994, four months before the end of his term as Commissioner of Corrections. He testified it was a personal loan offered during a family emergency that he gratefully accepted and repaid by providing six months of legal consulting work for Allvest, Incorporated from February 1995 to July 1995. He testified that Bill Weimar had a contract to provide halfway house services to Corrections. Neither the prosecution nor defense offered evidence that the loan was accepted in exchange for official acts, special interest favors, or was related in any way to a specific impropriety. Allvest faced two lawsuits that allege its board of directors defrauded plaintiffs in two 2001 court judgments that held the private corporation responsible for wrongful actions. Attorneys Tim Dooley and Brett von Gemmingen alleged that Allvest owner Weimar sold Allvest assets valued at more than $17 million and distributed most of those funds to himself, with the transfer approved by the Allvest board of directors which was composed of Weimar, Prewitt, and Robert Cronen. \\"These transfers were made with the intent to evade just obligations,\\" Dooley allege(d) in his lawsuit ...Fairbanks News-Miner 11/08/02 Prewitt also acknowledged making an improper campaign contribution in 2002 that could have resulted in a civil fine or written warning if the violation had come to the attention of the Alaska Public Offices Commission (APOC). The issue had become moot because fines or warnings for Alaska campaign contribution violations could only be issued within twelve months of the alleged violation (Alaska Statutes 15.56.130). The defense used both incidents as an attempt to question Prewitt's motives and truthfulness before the jury.Anchorage Daily News 07/03/07 The defense was unsuccessful and on July 9, 2007 Thomas Anderson was convicted on all seven counts of criminal extortion, bribery, and money laundering., United States Department of Justice, July 9, 2007.

His incidental music to Hans von Wolzogen's Das Schloss der Herzen (1891) was first performed in 1897 in Berlin, in concert form. He placed great importance on the literary quality of his librettos, and corresponded with numerous librettists and composers. His many songs, at one time known in England, include the cycles Der Rattenf√§nger von Hameln, Der wilde J√§ger and Sapphos Ges√§nge; he also wrote orchestral works and male-voice choruses.

These engines had a displacement of 540 in¬≥ (8.85 L) and power ratings of around 165-175 hp (123-130 kW). They were the smallest members of the Wright Whirlwind engine family. Design and development Wright introduced the J-6 Whirlwind family in 1928 to replace the nine-cylinder R-790 series. The J-6 family included varieties with five, seven, and nine cylinders. The five-cylinder version was originally known as the J-6 Whirlwind Five, or J-6-5 for short. The U.S. government designated it as the R-540; Wright later adopted this and dropped the J-6 nomenclature. Like all the members of the J-6 Whirlwind family, the R-540 had larger cylinders than the R-790. The piston stroke of 5.5 in (14.0 cm) was unchanged, but the cylinder bore was expanded to 5.0 in (12.7 cm) from the R-790's bore of 4.5 in (11.4 cm). While the R-790 was naturally aspirated, the R-540, like the other J-6 engines, had a gear- driven supercharger to boost its power output. Wright gradually refined the R-540, using suffix letters to indicate successive versions. For example, the R-540A had 165 hp (123 kW), while the R-540E of 1931 had power boosted to 175 hp (130 kW) thanks to an improved cylinder head design. Wright sometimes named these versions according to their power, e.g. \\"Whirlwind 165\\" or \\"Whirlwind 175\\".Curtiss-Wright (1940) The engine was built in Spain as the Hispano-Suiza 5Q or Hispano-Wright 5Q without modification apart from the use of Hispano's patented nitriding finishing process.Lage (2004) pp.152-163 Operational history The R-540 was the smallest, least powerful member of the Whirlwind family and was designed for light aircraft. One of the more popular types to use it was the Curtiss Robin, a light civil utility aircraft. A few were also used in prototype military trainer aircraft that were evaluated by the U.S. Army but not put into production. The R-540 sold well at first, with over 400 engines being built in 1929.. Transcribed from Wright Aeronautical documents by Robert J. Neal T; available from the Aircraft Engine Historical Society's reference page. However, with the impact of the Great Depression, sales plummeted, and only about 100 further examples were built over the next eight years. Wright finally ceased production of five-cylinder Whirlwinds in 1937, concentrating on larger engines and leaving the market for small radials to companies like Kinner and Warner. Since R-540 engines were found solely in light aircraft, they weren't often used for groundbreaking flights. However, there were a couple of noteworthy exceptions which took advantage of the Whirlwind family's reputation for high reliability. In 1935, the brothers Al and Fred Key set a new flight endurance record of 653 hours, 34 minutes in the Curtiss Robin J-1 Ole Miss, flying over Meridian, Mississippi, from June 4 to July 1. Their plane was refueled and resupplied in flight, and they could perform simple engine maintenance by walking out on a small catwalk extending between the cabin and the engine. Douglas \\"Wrong-Way\\" Corrigan's famous unauthorized transatlantic flight from New York City to Dublin, Ireland on July 17‚Äì18, 1938, used a Curtiss Robin with an R-540 built from the parts of two used engines.Forden (1958) p.84 Applications * Curtiss Robin J-1 * Curtiss-Wright CW-16 * Detroit-Parks P-2A * Emsco B-7 * Kreider-Reisner Challenger C-4C (Fairchild KR-34C) * General Aristocrat * Saro Cloud * Spartan C3-165 * Stinson Junior SM-2AA and SM-2AB * Travel Air E-4000 * Waco BSO Engines on display Wright R-540 engines on display are uncommon, but there is one at the Strategic Air and Space Museum (formerly the Strategic Air Command Museum) near Ashland, Nebraska..

Intended to be the first single from the group's fifth album Boonoonoonoos (originally scheduled for a November 1980 release), the single was ultimately never included because the album release was delayed for one year. \\"Children of Paradise\\" peaked at #11 in the German charts whereas it became the group's lowest placing in the UK at #66 only when released in February '81. Boney M. would use the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. The sides would usually be switched on the accompanying 12\\" single. Children of Paradise A synth disco track, based on Moroccan Younes Migri's hit \\"Lili Twil\\", \\"Children of Paradise\\" went through several try-outs, and Boney M. themselves performed several different versions on various TV shows. The first single versions (with the ad for the 5th album on the back cover) had a double chorus after the 2nd verse and then faded during the 3rd verse. The second and final mix had only one chorus after the 2nd and faded after the 3rd chorus. The second single pressings was pressed with an ad for The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits on the back cover since it had been decided the new album needed more time to be completed. Lead vocal: Liz Mitchell. Backing vocals: Liz Mitchell, Marcia Barrett, Frank Farian. Gadda-Da-Vida Although no-one knew at the time it was recorded, \\"Gadda-Da-Vida\\" became a controversial Boney M. record since it turned out none of the original members sang on it. Due to a fall-out between producer Frank Farian and the group, he had session singers La Mama (Cathy Bartney, Patricia Shockley and Madeleine Davis) sing the female vocals while he did the deep male vocals as usual. The group only promoted it once on TV. Two different single edits were done of the full 9 minutes version that appeared on the 12\\" single. \\"Gadda-Da-Vida\\" was the A-side in Japan. Only the French release correctly stated the song title as In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida. Iron Butterfly released the original version on single in 1968.

It peaked at #13 in the German charts, their lowest placing so far after their commercial breakthrough. Boney M. would use the double A-side format in this period, typically with the A1 being the song intended for radio and A2 being more squarely aimed at discos. \\"Consuela Biaz\\" was first promoted as the A-side in Germany where the group performed it in pop show Musikladen. After a promotional visit to Spain where the group found \\"Malaika\\" had become a Top 10 hit, the title was remixed and then promoted as the A-side. It was the second consecutive Boney M. single not to be released in the UK and Japan. Malaika The original German and Spanish 4:30 single mix featured no percussion ad-libs and most notably, after the second verse it has a key- change to a drum / handclaps / a cappella chant before the song quickly fades. When producer Frank Farian remixed the song for the 12\\" single and a new 7\\" edit, he added more percussion and synth and deleted this key-change part and replaced with an outro with himself singing \\"Wimoweh, wimoweh\\" (deliberately borrowed from another African tune \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\").

A slightly different mix appeared on the original pressings, most notably including the line Tell me, is our dream about to end, sung by Frank Farian just before the second verse.

There have been two models, launched in 2003 and 2006. The vehicle is designed as a recreational all-road vehicle (ATV), rather than a utility or sport version. Rincon Generation 1 (2003‚Äì2005) Honda introduced the Rincon as their new top-of-the-line ATV using their largest ATV liquid-cooled four- stroke engine. The Rincon was the first ATV to feature an automotive-style automatic 3 speed transmission which shifts either automatically or can be switched to manual mode (called the Electronic Shift Program). The vehicles also featured a number of other high end features, some for the first time on Honda ATV, including radial tires, a center hydraulic disc brake system mounted on the rear output shaft, and a fully independent rear suspension system. Also included was Traxlok, enabling riders to switch between 2WD and 4WD modes with a simple thumb-operated switch and a torque-sensing front differential that reduces torque steer for lighter steering effort in 4WD. Available beginning in 2004 Honda added the GPScape model officially known as the TRX650GPS as an option which adds a built-in GPS unit contained within the instrument cluster assembly. The GPS featured storage for up to 100 waypoints, digital compass function indicating travel direction and an automatic compensating clock. Rincon Generation 2 (2006‚ÄìPresent) The Rincon continues as Hondas top-of-the line ATV but starting in 2006 Honda gave the FourTrax Rincon an update in response to customer request. The Rincon 650 became known as the Rincon 680i when the engine size enlarged from 649cc to 675cc. Officially known as the TRX680F and TRX680GPS. Along with the larger engine, Electronic Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) was introduced. New colors including NaturalGear Camouflage were added. New features included a rollover sensor to kill the engine in the event the vehicle is partially or fully overturned, front disc brakes, fuel injection, increased power output, improved fuel mileage, elimination of the manual choke and much-easier cold starting, automatic compensation at different altitudes, automatic temperature compensation, a shorter engine warm-up period, and smoother idle. The manual fuel shut-off petcock was removed, with the PGM-FI an automotive style fuel gauge was added. When the fuel level reaches the E symbol a low-fuel warning light begins to flash letting the rider know that they have about 1.1 gallons of fuel remaining, or enough for approximately 28 miles of reserve range.

Design of memorial  The Memorial was designed by artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset. The Cuboid is made of concrete. On the front side of the cuboid is a window, through which visitors can see a short film of two kissing men. The work is the third of its kind in Germany following Frankfurter Engel (1994) in Frankfurt and K√∂lner Rosa Winkel (1995) in Cologne. The memorial was discussed by all parties in the Bundestag, which granted permission in 2003. Near the memorial is a signboard, which is written in German and English. There visitors can read over persecutions during Nazism and under Paragraph 175, the law during the 1950s and 1960s that outlawed homosexuality. It was reformed in 1969, attenuated in 1973 and finally voided in 1994.  History of memorial  Gay victims of Nazism were not officially recognised in the immediate aftermath of the Third Reich ‚Äì Paragraph 175 remained part of the German penal code during the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1980s, these \\"forgotten victims\\" were finally discussed. In 1985, for instance, president Richard von Weizs√§cker remembered homosexuals as a \\"victim group\\". The group Der homosexuellen NS-Opfer gedenken and the organization Lesben- und Schwulenverband began promoting a memorial in Berlin in 1993. On 12 December 2003, the Bundestag approved the erection of a memorial in Berlin at the boundary of Tiergarten (near the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe). Then the competition for artists started. Politicians attending the 27 May 2008 dedication included Berlin's Mayor Klaus Wowereit, President of the Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse, German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann, Volker Beck and Renate K√ºnast. Mayor Wowereit gave the opening speech for the memorial. Following its dedication, it was frequently vandalized that year.\\"Berlin gay Holocaust memorial vandalized\\", QX. August 30, 2008. Accessed June 13, 2011\\"Vandals Hit Berlin's Gay Holocaust Memorial a Second Time\\", Towel Road. December 16, 2008. Accessed June 13, 2011  Controversies  After the competition for an artist, which Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset won, a discussion was held regarding the video, specifically whether to include lesbians kissing. Lesbians victimized under Nazism have not been documented, though there are instances recorded of lesbian pubs in cities like Berlin which were lost. The feminist magazine EMMA protested that the memorial should also be for persecuted lesbian women. As result of the discussion, the video will be changed every two years and will also show kissing lesbians.Bundesregierung: Kulturstaatsminister Bernd Neumann erzielt Einigung beim Denkmal f√ºr die im Nationalsozialismus verfolgten Homosexuellen In 2008, the Holocaust survivor and historian Israel Gutman questioned its location near the Jewish Holocaust Memorial in Berlin. \\"The location was particularly poorly chosen for this monument,\\" Gutman told Polish newspaper Rzeczpospolita. \\"If visitors have the impression that there was not a great difference between the suffering of Jews and those of homosexuals ‚Äì exclusively German ‚Äì it's a scandal.\\" He explained that the German people \\"understood the immense scope of the crime of the Holocaust which they had committed, but this time, they made an error,\\" because \\"a sense of proportion must be maintained.\\" Yet indeed, the immense size of the Holocaust Memorial does maintain a sense of proportion.

This strong flow of air that develops in the upper atmosphere during the Asian monsoon is centred on 15¬∞N, 50-80¬∞E and extends from South- East Asia to Africa. The strongest development of the jet is at about 15 km above the Earth's surface with wind speeds of up to 40 m/s over the Indian Ocean. Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) comes into existence quickly after the Sub Tropical Jet (STJ) has shifted to the north of the Himalayas (Early June). TEJ flows from east to west over peninsular India at 6 ‚Äì 9 km and over the Northern African region. The formation of TEJ results in the reversal of upper air circulation patterns (high pressure switches to low pressure) and leads to the quick onset of monsoon. Recent observations have revealed that the intensity and duration of heating of Tibetan Plateau has a direct bearing on the amount of rainfall in India by the monsoons. When the summer temperature of air over Tibet remains high for a sufficiently long time, it helps in strengthening the easterly jet and results in heavy rainfall in India. The easterly jet does not come into existence if the snow over the Tibet Plateau does not melt because this weakens the Tibetan heating. This hampers the occurrence of rainfall in India. Therefore, any year of thick and widespread snow over Tibet will be followed by a year of weak monsoon and less rainfall.

Biography  He was born in Florence and studied at the Naples Conservatorio della Piet√† dei Turchini. In 1748 he came to Prague and joined the Locatelli ensemble. In the beginnings of his career he devoted himself mainly to the kapellmeister activities, and composed predominantly the cembalo sonatas. Rutini performed his first \\"Prague opera\\", Alessandro nell¬¥Indie, in 1750. Another opera, Semiramide riconosciuta, was dedicated to the \\"nobility of the Czech Kingdom\\". Rutini later moved with Locatelli and his group to the Russian St. Petersburg. He composed there the comic operas, mainly to the librettos of Carlo Goldoni. He was also the piano teacher of Catherine II, the future Russian empress. Since early 1760s he came back to Florence, and continued in the opera composing. The manuscripts of his operas are stored in the Landesbibliothek in Dresden, in the library of the Florence conservatory, and also in Civico Museo Bibliographico in Bologna.

Discovered by NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology, the galaxy is the record holder for the brightest starburst galaxy in the very distant universe, with brightness being a measure of its extreme star-formation rate. The Baby Boom Galaxy has been nicknamed \\"the extreme stellar machine\\" because it is seen producing stars at a rate of up to 4,000 per year (one star every 2.2 hours). The Milky Way galaxy in which Earth resides turns out an average of just 10 stars per year. Discovery The Baby Boom Galaxy was discovered and characterized in 2008 using a suite of telescopes operating at different wavelengths. NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Japan's Subaru Telescope, atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, first spotted the galaxy in visible-light images, where it appeared as an inconspicuous smudge due to its great distance. It wasn't until the Spitzer and the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, also on Mauna Kea in Hawaii, observed the galaxy at infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, respectively, that the galaxy was formally discovered. Strange behavior The Baby Boom Galaxy is so named because it generates over 4,000 stars per year (compared to an average of just 10 per year for the Milky Way). At that rate, the galaxy needs only 50 million years to create as many stars as the most massive galaxy ever observed. The discovery also challenges the accepted model for galaxy formation, which has most galaxies slowly bulking up by absorbing pieces of other galaxies, rather than growing internally. Another unusual aspect is the fact that scientists are observing this galaxy at a time when the universe was only a little over 1.4 billion years old, meaning that this galaxy was exhibiting this strange behaviour while the universe was still in its infancy. \\"This galaxy is undergoing a major baby boom, producing most of its stars all at once,\\" said Peter Capak of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at the California Institute of Technology. \\"If our human population was produced in a similar boom, then almost all of the people alive today would be the same age.\\" To that, the principal investigator of the Cosmic Evolution Surveyor, Nick Scoville of Caltech responded: \\"We may be witnessing, for the first time, the formation of one of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the universe.\\"  Colors The red color on the galaxy represent the birth of new stars. The color green represents a denoted gas, while the blue shows other galaxies that are less active in producing stars. See also References [Baby Boomer Galaxy Found - Universe Today.

The game is tied to the SanrioTown website, where players are required to register a free account. Premise The game tells the story of a hero (the player) helping Hello Kitty and her friends wake up from eternal slumber and defeat a \\"mysterious and malevolent power\\".  History  SanrioDigital hosted three phases of testing.  Closed Beta  The closed beta application was announced on February 13, 2008 running through February 21, 2008. More than 50,000 applications were submitted. Due to the limited number of testing accounts available, applicants were instructed to create a video explaining why the applicant should be chosen to participate in the closed beta test. This submission process ran until March 10, 2008 with selected applications being announced on March 18, 2008. The Closed Beta phase began on April 23, 2008, and ran through June 1, 2008. During this Closed Beta period, Sanrio Digital joined with the game community MMOSite to give away more accounts to beta testers. Founders' Beta On September 12, 2008, news was posted on the Official Blog announcing a Beta stage called \\"Founders' Beta\\" scheduled to run from October 8, 2008 to November 8, 2008. Players who are selected for the Founder's Beta will be given special rewards, and will be able to keep characters and possessions at the end of the Founder's Beta. The announcement stated that there would be improvements to the client and game systems. A press release was also posted on the Sanrio Digital blog. Applications to participate in the Founders' Beta were accepted through email, through which 20,000 accounts were issued. = Food for Friends = From November 3 to 6, 2008, Sanrio ran Food for Friends, a charity event where guilds crafted in-game food for donation UNICEF and the Asian Youth Orchestra. Based on the distribution of crafted food (quantity, difficulty, etc.), Sanrio Digital made a cash donation to those charities. During the event, guilds produced a total of 344,965 items which were donated to the Game Masters. This was in turn calculated at a value of $12,273, to be donated to UNICEF and the Asian Youth Orchestra.  Public stress test  A public stress test was announced on February 2, 2009, and ran from February 14 though February 17. All SanrioTown members, except those located in Europe, were invited to participate in the public stress test. The public stress test was extended until February 22, during which a new charity event was announced, allowing players to craft in-game items. Similar to the previous Food for Friends event, the actual in-game items were used as a conversion rate to real-world goods which were donated to the Po Leung Kuk residential child care unit.  International Releases   Indonesia  Sanrio Digital partnered with GOGAME to publish HKO in Indonesia. An Indonesian version of Founders' Beta started on April 15, 2009, running through April 29, 2009. The Indonesian Open Beta phase ran from June 16, 2009 through June 24, 2009. The commercial release of the Indonesian version was launched on July 1, 2009. The game ceased operation in December 2010. Singapore and Malaysia gloot.net is the publisher for HKO in Singapore and Malaysia, with a Founders Beta running from June 22 - July 22, 2009. The commercial release began on October 15, 2009. Philippines The game is officially published in the Philippines by Level Up! Games, launching an Open Beta on September 25, 2009, and a commercial launch occurring on November 11, 2009. On July 8, 2010, the Philippines version of HKO ceased operation, only to be reopened five months later on December 8 of the same year. Europe Hello Kitty Online was originally published by Burda: in Europe, with the game commercially launching on September 25, 2009. On March 26, 2010, Burdia: and SanrioDigitally formally announced that SanrioDigital will begin self-publishing the European version of HKO. On April 7, 2010, Burda: ceased to publish HKO Europe. Thailand SanrioDigital announced C2 Vision as the publisher of HKO in Thailand on October 14, 2009. The Thai version of HKO went into closed beta on May 28, 2010, with a commercial launch on July 5, 2010. HKO Thailand permanently closed on December 24, 2011 North America Aeria Games was chosen as the publisher for the North American release, with a transition back to Sanrio Digital occurring on June 1, 2010. Brazil GameMaxx will publish Hello Kitty Online in Brazil. Global in-game events On January 16, 2010, Sanrio Digital announced Food For Friends 2, the charity-driven in-game event to raise donations for charitable causes. The mechanics were similar to the previous Food For Friends, with players from North America, Singapore, Malaysia and Europe invited to participate. During the 10-day event, players from the various regions donated in-game items which were converted to US$18,038.30, the donations being delivered to Doctors Without Borders in response to the earthquake in Haiti. A new event, Chocolate Harbor Rescue, was released on September 9, 2010. During the event, players accumulate points which be used to calculate a charitable contribution as follows: * 50% of the funds will be provided to the Oceana group in support of recovery from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill * 50% will be donated to UNICEF to provide support in recovery of the 2010 Pakistan floods  Game play  Combat is secondary in HKO with focus on resource collecting and crafting. Several different locales based on, and named after, cities such as Beijing, Paris, London, Tokyo, and New York City are present as well wholly original and explorable areas. All players are represented by customizable human avatars. Available options during character creation include gender, hairstyle, eyes, skin tone, face and blood type. Combat, though not the primary focus of the game, is still relevant. Weapons take the form of various blunt implements such as brooms, flyswatters and microphone stands. Players enter combat by right-clicking on a nearby monster, at which point the avatar and the monster will begin to exchange blows. Monsters don't die in HKO, but when their health bar is fully depleted they become dizzy, pass out and are defeated, allowing players to loot them.  Resource Collection Skills  In the majority of MMORPGs players receive experience points and level increments by defeating opponents and completing quests; this is not the case in HKO, where players level-up primarily through resource collection and item crafting. Collecting resources is an important aspect of HKO because many items found in the game are obtained by crafting or purchasing from NPC vendors. Crafted items are generally superior to items bought from NPC vendors. Players must have the appropriate ingredients and/or resources in their inventory if they wish to craft. Resource collection has four subtypes of skill: woodcutting, gathering, planting and mining. Players must choose a primary and a secondary skill from these four subtypes. A character's chosen skills can reach much higher levels than skills not chosen. Since higher-level resources require a higher corresponding level, players are encouraged to trade amongst each other for resources. In order to gather resources players must equip a resource gathering tool such as a pick-axe and click on an available resource node. Resource tools have level requirements in respective skills (e.g., an advanced pick-axe would require a higher level in the mining skill). Item Crafting Item crafting is a key feature of Hello Kitty Online and, like resource collection, is divided into four skill subtypes: Cooking (food items that replenish health, energy or both); Tools/Weapons, Clothes (like weapons, clothes need to be created by the players themselves but can be traded to other players) and Furniture. Farming Each player receives a starter farm upon entering the game for the first time. The farm serves as the primary form of income in the game. Crops grown on the farm can be sold, traded to other players, or crafted into different items. Players can also purchase bigger and nicer (and pricier) farms. Successful farming requires players to take into consideration variables such as land fertility, pests and growth factors. If you don't water your farm frequently, the plants will dry out and die. But be aware that there are moles that sometimes come to farms to eat your plants. Pet System Every defeated monster in HKO has a chance of dropping a rare pet card that can be used to gain that monster's service, effectively making that monster a player's pet. Players may own a maximum of 3 pets in total, and only one pet can be used at any time. Pets have a variety of roles: they can act as mules, providing extra inventory space; some pets provide a buff to player stats while they are in service; lastly, they are able to help when it comes to collecting resources. Pets gain levels from food: when pets are fed regularly, their stats and level will increase over time. Player versus Player (PvP) Hello Kitty Online contains no direct PvP, though players may choose to compete amongst themselves in a number of available minigames. Minigames Minigames available in-game and in SanrioTown web site member's area provide players a chance to compete with each other. Housing System Each player's farm has an allotted space on which the farm's owner can build a house. In order to build a house, players require a land certificate, which can be bought from an NPC or received as a quest reward. Construction can begin after sufficient amounts of the required resources have been accumulated. There is a variety of different houses; the more elaborate and extravagant, the more expensive. Once a house is completed, players can furnish the interiors with different appliances, furniture and interior elements such as wallpapers and floorboards. Socializing HKO advocates the concept of \\"social networking\\". Players can view other players' blogs, send email, and watch uploaded videos from in-game or on the SanrioTown web site. Players can also band together to form a guild. Guildmates can help each other build to speed up the construction of houses. Group Quests will be available in the future updates to the game. Community The design of Hello Kitty Online emphasizes the use of the game and SanrioTown web site as a social community platform. A number of social features found on SanrioTown were integrated directly into the game client, and HKO players are able to access SanrioTown's video sharing service, blogs and emails with a hellokitty.com address. Players can also participate in the discussions posted on the community forums. The official HKO website includes a wiki, nicknamed Kittypedia by forum users, which players can edit to include updated information about the game. The wiki discusses pets, items, NPCs, guilds, and other aspects of the game. Item Mall The Item Mall was located both on the SanrioTown website and the game. At the Item Mall players would purchase premium items including unique clothes, pets, weapons and house designs. Purchases would require Sanrio Loyalty Points (which are gained from using SanrioTown services such as blogs), and Sanrio Cash Points (which are purchased using real money). Another method was paying money in exchange for points using game cards. Reception Hello Kitty Online Closed Beta garnered mixed, though mostly positive, reactions from the media and players. Noctalis.com called it \\"a cloyingly sweet pink-filled wonderland of talking animals set to a chirpy soundtrack\\". The game's sprite-based and isometric perspective 2.5D graphics were criticized as 10-year-old technology, and the lack of customization options for each character (e.g. dye kits or ways to change the color of the home items) was noted. IGN's hands-on review of the Closed Beta was largely favorable, concluding: With the SanrioTown blog feature, gamers were able to share their experiences while playing the game. The players were also responsible for helping out the newbies with their blog and video tutorials. Generally, players found other players and the HKO staff to be pleasant and helpful, citing the HKO environment as a breather from the \\"griefing\\" and PvP-confrontations that affect most online games. House building was found to be difficult and players complained that they had to ask their guild mates to help. Hello Kitty Online's Closed Beta was praised for being largely free of bugs; the help and support provided by the developers was praised by players as swift and earnest, and it was considered a remarkable achievement by one reviewer. A post on the Outblaze Blog dated February 15, 2008 summarized several online reactions to the closed beta announcement, and included humorous comments from influential game blog Kotaku, ValleyWag, InventorSpot, Japanator, and others. While the game was generally positively received, many players became frustrated with the lack of attention to the game by its developers and a large portion quit the game. An increasing number of the remaining players, however, are attempting to encourage new players to join the game and old ones to return as well as attempting to contact the developers. HKO Insider On April 1, 2008, the World of Warcraft news and strategy web site WoW Insider announced that it would no longer cover World of Warcraft, but would switch to Hello Kitty Online. The banner that originally read \\"WoW Insider\\" was replaced with one that read \\"HKO Insider\\", with images of Hello Kitty on both ends. WoW Insider's April 1 content consisted exclusively of satirical articles (at least 26 of them) based on Hello Kitty Online. In the 28th article to be posted to the web site, an announcement was made that the site would revert to WoW Insider. Island Adventure Pack On April 1, 2008, Sanrio Digital issued an April Fools' Day announcement revealing the first Hello Kitty Online expansion pack, entitled \\"Island Adventure\\", was scheduled for release in 2009. The news was posted on the main SanrioTown blog as well as the official HKO blog. The title of the fictional expansion pack is a reference to the South Park episode \\"Make Love, Not Warcraft\\", in which the character Butters Stotch states that he prefers \\"Hello Kitty Island Adventure\\" to more violent and competitive games such as World of Warcraft. According to Sanrio Digital's April Fools' release: The fake news was used as material for a humorous article on WoW Insider.  Awards  Hello Kitty Online was awarded a Best Digital Entertainment Award for the 2008 Hong Kong ICT Awards.  2015 Hack  In 2015, the HKO database from the SanrioTown website was leaked online, exposing the private information from 3.3 million accounts, including first and last names, birthdays, gender, country of origin, passwords, and email addresses. This indirectly lead to the removal of any functionality of the Item Mall.  Decline in popularity and closure  There were many factors that went into the game's decline in popularity. A few parts of the game were undeveloped in the game's earlier stages, which caused some people to stop playing after finishing the story. A physical release of the game was announced, but delayed, so it didn't sell as well as it could have. In 2010, Sanrio announced a Tokyo city quest, but it was never released. Instead, players got a stripped down New York quest. The final quest was the 2012 Valentine's Day quest. According to MMO Fallout, Sanrio stopped supporting the game in March 2012. Presumably, this is when download links to the game were removed from the website. The game stopped receiving any updates, and was essentially abandoned. Sometime after, the original site, hellokittyonline.com, redirected to the SanrioTown website, which blocked users from making new accounts (although some found ways around it). Because traces of the game began to disappear, many people stopped playing, but the forums were still active with old and new players, who would log on occasionally, although the game was clearly not well taken care of, since Sanrio Digital was shifting their focus to mobile games instead. The servers remained active with minimal amounts of players until around 2017, when the game was taken offline permanently, unbeknownst to many people outside of the loyal fandom. The exact shutdown date is unknown, but a fan blog claims the last time they were able to log in was in August 2017.

The area was previously covered in thick dryland forest characterized by cedar trees, (Juniperus spp.), and Leleshwa bushes (Tarchonanthus camphoratus). In addition, Wild Jasmine and Boophone are also found. The land belongs to Njenga Karume, who bought it from Arthur Cole in 1980. Cole had bought it from Digby Tatham-Warter (famous for his role in the Battle of Arnhem) in 1968, as grazing land of low potential. The land is unsuitable for either small scale cultivation or cattle ranching as it is covered in thick bush growing from the profusion of lava boulders. Geography The land is punctuated by pyroclastic cones of Holocene age. The highest peak has an elevation of 2126 metres. It is located between Lake Elmenteita and Ol Doinyo Eburru volcano, on the southern boundary of the Soysambu Conservancy. Some of the prominent peaks include \\"Horseshoe Crater\\" and \\"Scout Hat Hill\\". There are some lava tubes which show evidence of prehistoric occupation as grinding plates and stone bowls have been recovered by the local people in rudimentary excavation. These caves have been occupied by some of the refugees from the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya. People in the Elmenteita Badlands The area was heavily degraded from the 1980s onwards, being a hideout for disaffected and disenfranchised people who have resorted to charcoal burning, poaching and changaa brewing. A trading centre has been built at the northeastern corner known as \\"Soko Mjinga\\" (Fool's Market) which is the place to trade in these items. The living conditions in the Otutu forest have led to an outbreak of leishmaniasis or Aleppo boil which is spread by sandflies and rock hyrax, which are numerous there. The only sources of water are from some small steam vents beside the old railway line along the eastern boundary of the forest (currently a road), which ran between Elmenteita and Gilgil before it was realigned in 1945. The Eburru station (now defunct) is on the edge of the Otutu and is notable for the steam condensers made from oil drums and corrugated iron sheets which the residents construct for their water source. A luxury tourist lodge, called Mawe Mbili Lodge, is currently under construction on the western boundary of the forest, on the slopes of \\"Scout Hat Hill\\", so called because the shape resembles Baden Powell's hat. It is projected to open in March 2009. The water supply is from rainwater caught from plastic sheeting and from a deep and alkaline borehole which provides water at over 50 degrees Celsius and a pH of nearly 8.

He is credited with the devotional poem to the Hindu god Murugan in the PattuppƒÅ·π≠·π≠u anthology, titled TirumurukƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai. In the historic Tamil tradition, he is believed to have also authored a second poem in the Sangam collection titled Ne·π≠unalvƒÅ·π≠ai, as well as a detailed commentary on Iraiyanar Akapporul (lit. Grammar of Stolen Love). However, according to the Tamil literature scholar Kamil Zvelebil, the TirumurukƒÅ·πü·πüuppa·π≠ai and the Ne·π≠unalvƒÅ·π≠ai were likely authored by two different Nakkirar, and Nakkƒ´ra·πâ√£r and the older Nakkƒ´rar were different individual. It is uncertain as to which century Nakkiranar lived, much like the chronology of the Sangam literature. Scholars variously place his works between 3rd and 8th century CE, with Zvelebil suggesting late classical. Nakkƒ´ra·πâ√£r's poem Tirumurukarruppatai is the most ancient known bhakti genre poem of 312 akaval verses on Murugan (also known as Subrahmanya, Kumara, Skanda, Kartikeya in other parts of India). The Tirumurukarruppatai is held in \\"very high esteem\\" in the Murugan tradition as well as the Murugan's father Shiva tradition. It is of interest to history, architecture and religious studies because it describes different temples of Murugan in ancient Tamil Nadu, devotional practices, and the theological legends. The author paints in words the scenes of nature near these temples, towns, and the culture of ancient South Indian Hinduism. He is one of the prominent characters in the Thiruvilaiyadal Puranam. The Thiruvilaiyadal episodes of the confrontation of Sundareswarar (Shiva) with Nakkeerar are enacted as a part of the Meenakshi Amman Temple festival traditions of Madurai.

The vote in the Lok Sabha arose after the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front withdrew support from the government, who wanted to pursue an Indo-US nuclear deal. Events and allegations In 2008, the 123 Agreement signed between the United States of America and the Republic of India is known as the U.S.‚ÄìIndia Civil Nuclear Agreement or Indo-US nuclear deal. The framework for this agreement was an 18 July 2005, joint statement by then Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh and then U.S. President George W. Bush, under which India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and to place all its civil nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and, in exchange, the United States agreed to work toward full civil nuclear cooperation with India. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) that was supporting the Dr Manmohan Singh government, objected to the agreement citing reasons that proposal would see the United States supply nuclear technology to India in return for India agreeing to United Nations inspections of its nuclear programs and the splitting of the civil and military aspects of those programs. CPI(M) believed that this would cause India to be effectively subservient to the US. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also objected, on the grounds that the inspections could impede development of the country's nuclear arms program. It had been argued by Dr. Manmohan Singh and his party that the nuclear infrastructure needed to be developed more rapidly because the existing electric generation facilities were incapable of meeting growing demand. The United Progressive Alliance (UPA), the governing alliance in India elected in 2004, faced its first confidence vote in the Lok Sabha (the lower house of Parliament) on 22 July 2008 after the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front withdrew support over India approaching the IAEA for the Indo-US nuclear deal. The vote was so crucial that the UPA and the opposition parties summoned MPs from their sick beds and even from prison cells to take part in the vote, which was eventually won by the Government.Second day of trust motion India Today Group Online The government's success in the 2008 confidence vote was marred when three BJP MPs, including Ashok Argal, waved bundles of cash which they produced from bags in parliament during the debate, accusing the government of giving it to them in order to buy their support or abstention in the vote. The BJP demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh over the allegations and claimed that they had video evidence of the deals being made, while the CPI(M) leader said that \\"Practically every member of parliament has been approached with offers of money and inducements.\\" The government denied the allegations, pointing out that Argal would have self-incriminated himself by admitting to receiving a bribe. The Speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, asked New Delhi's police chief to investigate. A fortnight later, on 2 August, the BJP offered \\"documentary evidence\\" to support its allegation that Argal, Faggan Singh Kulaste and Mahaveer Bhagora had been bribed. The evidence included transcripts of video recordings and explanatory letters from two of the MPs, all of which was passed to the investigatory committee that had been set up by parliament. The BJP also criticised CNN-IBN, who had recorded the BJP MP's attempt to sting the government but had not broadcast it. The tapes were broadcast on 12 August 2008 after CNN-IBN had made its appearance before the investigating committee. The company had resisted the calls for an earlier broadcast on the grounds of legal opinion that it had not yet attended the committee and that the broadcast might prejudice the investigatory process. The parliamentary investigation began on 30 July 2008 and has frequently been referred to as the Kishore Chandra Deo committee. The committee reported in December 2008 that it had found no evidence of bribery in the case of Rajya Sabha members Amar Singh and Ahmad Patel. They had been accused of offering the bribes, and Singh was a prominent member of the Samajwadi Party (SP) which had begun to support the government at the time when the Left Front moved to oppose it. The committee also recommended further investigation into the activities of Sanjeev Saxena, Sohail Hindustani and Sudheendra Kulkarni. Saxena was an aide to Amar Singh, Kulkarni had a similar role for the BJP leader, L. K. Advani and Hindustani was a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activist (although some early reports say that he was a driver). Some committee members distanced themselves from the report's full conclusions but agreed that the additional investigation was needed. The report concluded that the video evidence relating to a car at Singh's house was insufficient proof: it was not possible to determine who was in the car and \\"It does not prove what transpired inside the house. There is nothing to show that money was offered for voting in favour of the motion of confidence or for abstaining from voting.\\" A police investigation was instigated in January 2009 to look into the issues relating to Saxena, Hindustani and Kulkarni which had been recommended in the report of the parliamentary committee. In his autobiography Drohkaal ka Pathik, released in November 2013, former MP Pappu Yadav alleged that during the July 2008 trust vote, both the Congress and BJP had offered \\"Rs 40 crore each\\" to MPs of his Indian Federal Democratic Party, for their support.http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pappu-s-memoirs-payoffs-from-upa--- nda/1200046/ Reports of evidence Revelations by WikiLeaks The Congress Party had worked to support the government in the vote and on 17 March 2011 WikiLeaks claimed that Nachiketa Kapur, a Congress Party political aide, had boasted to US Embassy officials in July 2008 that his party had funds to bribe MPs in order to obtain a favourable outcome. Kapur claimed that four MPs who were members of Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) had already been paid off. The Hindu reported that Former United States Ambassador to India David Campbell Mulford commented that US diplomatic cables were \\"generally accurate\\" but that all he could recall of the incident was that someone \\"turned out with a suitcase of money and dumped it on the table ... That was clear theatrics.\\" In denying any wrongdoing, the RLD pointed out that they only had three MPs at the time, not four as stated in the leaked cable. Satish Sharma, who was the person for whom Kapur acted as an aide according to the cable, said that he had no aide at all. The revelations led immediately to further calls for the resignation of Manmohan Singh and also for an investigation of the activities of Kapur and Sharma. There were also calls for the issue of a First Information Report (FIR), which is the formal means by which the police record their notification of an offence. It was announced on the following day, 18 March, that the police investigation into the original allegations was near to completion. Tehelka expose Tehelka, a sometimes controversial publication that specialises in expos√©s, reported that the entire affair was a BJP set-up designed to entrap members of the government. The report was based on an account given by Siddharth Gautam, a CNN-IBN reporter who had been involved, and on some recordings of telephone conversations that had not previously been made available. Supreme Court involvement An application was made to the Supreme Court on 2 April requesting that it ordered a Special Investigation Team to probe the affair. The applicants were a group calling themselves the India Rejuvenation Initiative and they argued that the investigatory process had stalled since the report of the parliamentary committee. The hearing was adjourned to due a procedural irregularity in the application, and when this was resolved on 2 May the Court issued notices to the Delhi police and government that required them to provide information regarding the current status of the investigation. The petitioners said that On 7 July the Court voiced its frustration with the continued absence of the requested status reports and set a filing deadline of 15 July. The police had requested a further two months to fulfil the request. Upon being presented with the status report, the Court criticised the lethargy of the police investigation, complaining that little had been done and that which had been done was poorly documented, inconsistent and in places factually incorrect. The court was similarly disparaging of a second report which followed on from a burst of activity by the police. On 5 August 2011, Justice Loda said Arrests Sudheendra Kulkarni In September 2011, a former aide of India's top opposition leader LK Advani, Sudheendra Kulkarni, has been arrested in connection with an alleged cash-for- votes scandal. Kulkarni is alleged to have \\"master-minded\\" the operation. He says it was to expose corruption in the government. Kulkarni was an aide to senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani at the time of the vote. He told the court that he was \\"a whistleblower\\" who intended to expose corruption. Police allege that Kulkarni approached Amar Singh's Samajwadi Party - an ally of the Congress-led government at the time of the vote - to offer bribe to BJP MPs. He then got a television channel to secretly film the alleged bribe giving in order to nail the government, police allege. Sanjeev Saxena Sanjeev Saxena, alleged to be an aide of the then Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh was arrested on 17 July, two days after the police had been criticised by the Court. The police claimed to have sufficient evidence to prove that he had delivered money to the three BJP MPs and alleged that he had misled both their inquiry and that of parliament. They also announced that they had interviewed Bhahora and Kulaste, who were no longer MPs, but that their ability to interview Argal was hampered because he was still in office. They had applied to the Home Ministry for permission to interview him and Amar Singh, still a member of the Rajya Sabha, and further announced that they intended to re-interview Hindustani. The developments caused Deo to clarify that his committee had not absolved Singh of any involvement but rather that it had found no evidence to confirm involvement. He also had to explain that the decision not to interview Singh had been because the committee had no prima facie evidence of Singh's involvement, the summonsing process for a Rajya Sabha member would have been complex, and the outcome may have still been a failure to attend as Singh was not obliged to do so. Furthermore, he stated, the dissenting members of the committee had agreed with its conclusions but had disagreed with his chairmanship. Deo had become a cabinet minister on 12 July. Sohail Hindustani Delhi Police arrested Sohail Hindustani, a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activist was arrested on 20 July and announced that he would be repeating his previous statements that he had been approached by Singh and some members of the Congress Party who had wanted him to \\"arrange\\" BJP votes. The police described him as the \\"orchestrator\\" and explained that he was working for the BJP in an attempt to entrap the government, but his defence counsel has claimed that he was just a \\"whistleblower\\" and that as such he should not have been the primary focus of police attention. The BJP took a similar line to defence counsel, claiming that the investigation was an \\"eyewash\\", querying how police lethargy had turned so quickly and suggesting that they were being put under pressure by the government. Amar Singh Amar Singh was interviewed on 22 July and on the same day the police announced that they wished to speak with SP MP Rewati Raman Singh, whom the BJP MPs alleged had approached them on behalf of Amar Singh. On the same day, the Court ordered that Hindustani and Saxena should be detained in custody for 14 days, despite defence arguments of police misconduct. The defence claimed that the police had not interviewed Hindustani and therefore had no new evidence upon which to base their recent claims of orchestration. When the police stated that interviews had taken place the defence counsel responded by noting that they had not been present for any such interviews and that their presence was a legal requirement. The detentions were subsequently extended to 18 August. Despite Amar Singh having previously fallen out with his party's leadership and being expelled from the party, Mulayam Singh, the leader of the SP, voiced his support for the ex-member on 24 July and claimed that Amar Singh had been framed. Rewati Raman Singh and Argal were interviewed by police on the following day, with Singh claiming that he gave them the same details as he had previously given to the investigatory committee, and Argal claiming that in fact Singh had approached him in relation to facilitating the alleged bribe. Kulkarni was interviewed on 14 July. Amar Singh was arrested on 6 September for his alleged involvement in the scam and was ordered to be remanded in custody until 19 September. He had appealed to the court to exempt him from appearing personally, stating that he was ill with an infection; however, his request was rejected. On 22 November 2013, a Delhi court accepted the statements of Amar Singh and three BJP men - Faggan Singh Kulaste, Ashok Argal and Mahabir Singh Bhagora - that their actions had been as whistleblowers. Saxena still stands trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Leonard (January 2, 1896 ‚Äì August 1, 1970), better known as Lank Leonard, was an American cartoonist artist who created the long-running comic strip Mickey Finn, which he drew for more than three decades. Biography Early life and career Born in Port Chester, New York in 1896, Leonard decided early in his childhood that he wanted to be a cartoonist while he made copies of Buster Brown, Happy Hooligan, Little Nemo and The Katzenjammer Kids, eventually creating his own characters. In high school, he was the art editor of his school newspaper. After his high school graduation, Leonard took a job as a bookkeeper at a local factory, where he also drew cartoons for the plant's house organ. He studied at a business college from 1914 to 1915, then served in the U.S. Army during World War I. Returning from the service, Leonard designed a new type of suction sole basketball shoe for a sporting goods firm, which eventually hired him as a salesman. He was in his early twenties, working as a traveling salesman, when he met cartoonist Clare A. Briggs on a train between Sioux City and Omaha and showed him the sketch pad he always carried. \\"Pretty crude, but there's no doubt you have talent,\\" said Briggs.Waugh, Coulton. The Comics. Macmillan, 1947. Briggs referred him to Chicago Tribune editorial cartoonist Carey Orr, who suggested Leonard take the C. L. Evans correspondence course in cartooning. Leonard did so, mailing in assignments drawn in hotel rooms as he traveled about the country. Later, he took night courses at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and New York's Art Students League. In the spring of 1925, Leonard left his salesman job and started working full-time as a cartoonist. As an inker at the Bray Productions animation studio, he took home a salary of $11 a week. He then drew sports cartoons for a baseball magazine, then spent nine years doing a sports cartoon feature for the George Matthew Adams Syndicate and writing about sports, while also selling sports cartoons to The New York Telegram and The New York Sun. Weighing in at 200 pounds and towering over six feet, the lanky Leonard also played semi-pro basketball. Mickey Finn In 1936, the McNaught Syndicate bought his comic strip Mickey Finn about the family life of an Irish-American policeman. From the start, the strip was calculated to show the good qualities of human nature rather than the sordid side of crime. Appearing in more than 300 newspapers at the height of its success, the strip continued under Leonard for the next three decades, assisted by Mart Bailey and Morris Weiss with lettering by Tony DiPreta. Leonard also did a topper strip, Nippie: He's Often Wrong!, which ran beneath the Sunday Mickey Finn. Nippie was a child who ignored warnings in order to do things his way and suffered the consequences. The character of Mickey Finn was inspired by Leonard's observations of Port Chester policeman Mickey Brennan. Other characters in Mickey Finn were drawn from Lank Leonard's own family, and the model for Mickey Finn was Leonard himself. Mickey's mother was based on numerous sketches of Leonard's mother, and his real-life Uncle Phil inspired the comic strip Uncle Phil. Kitty Kelly, Mickey's fianc√©e, was modeled on Florence McLaughlin, whom Leonard married in June 1939.1951 McNaught Syndicate promotional copy. After World War II, Leonard began working in Miami, Florida, during the winter months, and in 1950, he bought a split-level home in Miami Shores, spending ten months of the year there, drawing and playing golf.Davis, Mila. \\"Cartoonist Bows to Jet Age\\", The Miami Daily News, February 17, 1957.

He was a relative of Hugh S. Legar√©. He was by profession an inventor, artist, and author, but whose ill health prevented the commercialization of his devices. He contributed poetry to magazines, and published a single volume, Orta-Undis and other poems in 1848.Southern Life in Southern Literature by Maurice Garland Fulton Orta-undis means \\"sprung from water\\".  Biography  Born in Charleston, South Carolina, Legar√© was the son of John D. Legar√©, the founding editor of the farm journal Southern Agriculturalist, as well as the librarian of the Agricultural Society of South Carolina from 1828-1830, and Mary Doughty Mathewes. He attended the College of Charleston in 1841 before transferring the following year at St. Mary‚Äôs college in Baltimore, Maryland to be closer to his cousin, Hugh S. Legar√© who was then serving as the United States Attorney General.  St. Mary's College  While at St. Mary‚Äôs, he studied ancient and modern languages as well as mathematics and chemistry. Although he did not graduate, he received an honorary certificate and won premiums in the individual subjects of rhetoric, natural history, astronomy, Spanish, German, and painting in oil. Following his cousin‚Äôs death in 1843, he returned to Charleston.  Charleston, South Carolina (Before Pulmonary Tuberculosis)  Upon his return to Charleston, he began to work as a law clerk in the offices of James L. Petrigru, although he did not continue in the field namely due to disinclination and poor health. and exhibiting his paintings to local exhibitions and submitting poems to local periodicals. During this time, he began experiencing lung hemorrhages, giving early indication of pulmonary tuberculosis. In favor of healthier climate and greater financial opportunity, he moved with his parents to Aiken, South Carolina.  Aiken, South Carolina  While living in Aiken, Legar√© tried various pathways to earn money and enhance his reputation. One such project was setting up a painting school for young women in the area, which would bring him many admirers including his future wife, Anne Andrews of Georgia. He also spent most of his time and energy on mechanical invention. Such developments included a new type of encaustic tile, an inexpensive glazier‚Äôs putty, and a material he called ‚Äúlignine‚Äù or ‚Äúplastic cotton‚Äù from which he fashioned shingles and furniture, as well as sculptures. Several of his furniture pieces are in the permanent collection of the Charleston Museum. The following commentary regarding the collection is taken from the Bulletin of the Charleston Museum: ‚ÄúThe decoration on this furniture is very elaborate and furniture and decorations are both in good state of preservation. The interest attached to them is due to the fact that the decoration is of cotton. Rendered plastic by a chemical process invented by Mr. Legare and stained walnut color, the cotton presents the appearance of wood and seems to be quite durable.‚Äù The rough translation of Orta-Undis is probably a reference to the famous painting The Birth of Venus by Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Legar√© sought recognition for his poetry and fiction, publishing Orta-Undis and other Poems in 1848. The rough translation \\"sprung from waves\\" is probably a reference to the painting ‚ÄúThe Birth of Venus‚Äù. It was published by William Davis Ticknor in Boston. It attracted good reviews, including the endorsement of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. He also published seventeen stories in popular periodicals, including the The Knickerbocker, Graham‚Äôs Magazine, and Putnam‚Äôs Magazine. A view of St. Thaddeus Episcopal Church, where Legar√© is buried. When he passed away in 1859, most of his inventions remained untried. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Thaddeus Episcopal Church in Aiken, with a grave marked by a memorial stone financed by local high school students in 1942.  The Legar√©-Morgan House and Legacy  The Legar√©-Morgan House, photo credited to Bill Fitzpatrick. Legar√© lived in a small one-story home in Aiken, South Carolina, between 1850 and 1859. While there, he built an addition to the house to use as a studio for his art and inventing as a separate building, but it was later moved to be a part of the main structure. Legar√©‚Äôs family sold the property to Thomas C. Morgan in 1870, and his descendants continue to live there until the time of its nomination. Legar√©‚Äôs poetry is studied today mostly in South Carolina, especially in Aiken, where he spent the last years of his life.  Orta-Undis and Other Poems  Orta- Undis and Other Poems was Legar√©‚Äôs only published volume of poetry. It establishes him as a southern poet in the Romantic tradition. His work was inspired by contemporary poets of his time like Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Edgar Allan Poe. Critics of his poems during his lifetime gave high remarks for his works describing the southern landscape, especially those with the description of the native flora: ‚ÄúHaw-Blossoms‚Äù and ‚ÄúTo Jasmines in December.‚Äù Praise was also given to his poem ‚ÄúOrnithologoi‚Äù (Bird Voices), which celebrates birdsong and laments the practice of shooting birds for sport. The dedication page in Orta-Undis is made out to his wife: ‚ÄúTo Her Whose virtues and earnest affection are the pride and happiness of my life; To the ‚Äòsweetest rose of Georgia, I dedicate this little volume.‚Äù The poems within the volume comprise a definite Romantic Era feeling: topics range from nature‚Äôs majesty (Haw-Blossoms) to the idea of feminine purity (To a Lilly) to the wealth of the soul (Que Carior?) Orta-Undis was printed by Thurston Torry & Co. for the publishing house of William D. Ticknor. 500 copies were printed to cost Ticknor 20 cents (adjusted for inflation, this would be $6.44 in 2019), and sold at 50 cents a copy ($16.09 in 2019), and a 10 percent commission account was risked by Legar√©. The volume received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom had differing opinions with some praising Legar√©‚Äôs work, and others frowning on it. It did not print and sell well, as he only collected around $23 ($740.08 in 2019 when adjusted for inflation). After his death in the early 1900s, his work underwent a local renaissance that was both critical and biographical.

Career Doris was built for the Royal Navy in the East India Company Dockyard in Bombay in 1807. She was launched as Salsette, and was renamed locally as Pitt later that year. However, because the Royal Navy already had an HMS Pitt in service, the Admiralty renamed her again as HMS Doris. HMS Doris initially saw service in the Malacca Straits and the South China Sea. Doris and captured in the China Sea an American ship named Rebecca. They brought her into Bombay where the new Vice admiralty court condemned her. Her cargo of 4,000 bags of Batavian sugar and 13,710 pieces of sapan-wood were auctioned on 7 March 1810. Then on 10 March Rebecca, of 600 tons burthen, teak-built at Pegu, too was auctioned off.Robert Houghton: A Peoples' History 1793 ‚Äì 1844 from the newspapers: Prize-taking. Accessed 16 October 2016. Towards the end of 1810 Doris was involved in the Mauritius campaign. In 1811 she participated in the invasion of Java. On 18 March 1814 Doris captured the American merchant ship Hunter off Macau. On 8 May chased an American schooner from New York through the estuary and into Pearl River. The American succeeded in reaching Whampoa where she anchored. Doris than sent her boats with 70 men into the river and captured the American ship. Only one British seaman was killed but several of the Americans died. The boarding party from Doris cut the schooner‚Äôs cables to sail her out from Chinese jurisdiction but the ship went aground. The boarding party then abandoned her. Doris finally brought Hunter into Bombay on 12 August for the recently- established Vice admiralty court to condemn. Doris apparently returned to Canton because around mid-September her boats recaptured Arabella, which the Portuguese had moved just outside Macanese waters. The American letter of marque ship had captured Arabella as Arabella was sailing from Bengal to Sumatra. Rambler brought Arabella with her as Rambler sailed onto Canton, but sent her into Macao when the Americans realized that Doris was at Canton. Doriss retaking of Arabella sparked a small incident between the British East India Company and the local authorities, who eventually accepted that Arabella was a lawful prize to Doris. Captain O'Brien, of Doris found he could not sell his prize, Arabella, on the China coast. When he received orders to proceed to Malacca after his replacement had arrived he wanted to take Arabella with him to try to sell her in Malaya. However, the night before they were to leave a severe gale caused Arabella to break her cables. She then broke up on nearby rocks.Sweetman (1993), p.141. Post-war Doris place in ordinary in 1815. She was recommissioned in 1821 and served two tours of duty on the South America station during the Chilean and Brazilian wars of independence and the Cisplatine War of 1825-1828 between Argentina and Brazil. Fate By the late 1820s, decayed timbers in her bow made her unfit for further service, and she was sold at Valparaiso in April 1829.Vale (2001). Captains During her 21 years in the Royal Navy she had eight captains. One of them was Barrington Reynolds, who commanded her for a short period in 1812, between his commands of and .

Cardanol finds use in the chemical industry in resins, coatings, frictional materials, and surfactants used as pigment dispersants for water-based inks. It is used to make phenalkamines, which are used as curing agents for the durable epoxy coatings used on concrete floors. The name of the substance is derived by contraction from the genus Anacardium, which includes the cashew tree, Anacardium occidentale. The name of the genus itself is based on the Greek word for heart. Friction particles are made by polymerizing the unsaturated side chain of cardanol, followed by cross-polymerization with formaldehyde to yield a cardanol- formaldehyde resin by a process analogous to the formation of phenol- formaldehyde resins such as Bakelite. Cardanol-phenol resins were developed in the 1920s by Mortimer T. Harvey, then a student at Columbia University. These resins found use in vehicle brakes after it was found that they had a coefficient of friction that was less sensitive to temperature changes than phenol-formaldehyde resins. Despite all these uses, only a fraction of the cardanol obtained from cashew nut processing is used in the industrial field. Therefore, there is still interest in developing new applications, such as new polymers. The name cardanol is used for the decarboxylated derivatives obtained by thermal decomposition of any of the naturally occurring anacardic acids. This includes more than one compound because the composition of the side chain varies in its degree of unsaturation. Tri-unsaturated cardanol, the major component (41%) is shown below. The remaining cardanol is 34% mono- unsaturated, 22% bi-unsaturated, and 2% saturated. In terms of physical properties, cardanol is comparable to nonylphenol. Cardanol is hydrophobic and remains flexible and liquid at very low temperatures; its freezing point is below ‚àí20 ¬∞C, it has a density of 0.930 g/mL, and boils at 225 ¬∞C under reduced pressure (10 mmHg).

There is no evidence as to how old is this village. Geography Khulua is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Khulua It has an average elevation of 80 metres (265 feet). The village is surrounded by river Ganga in the south, Majhlipatti and Dhabiya in the west, Daurahra in the east and Hanumananagar in the North. Commerce The main business of this villagers is Agriculture, but there are people working in both the Government and Private sectors. People work in MNC companies, whilst carpet manufacturing is the second largest employer and villagers go to Khamaria to do carpet work. All the villagers have their fields (Khet) so they do not need to buy wheat, rice, potatoes and other daily staples. A small forest is situated south of the village on the bank of river Ganga. This small forest is major seasonal source of income for many villagers. The thorny shrubs of the forest are supplied to bricks kilns nearby. Forest fire is used to convert the shrubs into saleable fuels. Conflict with neighbouring villages happen over rights of the forest, known as Majhra. The UP Government plan for the Ganges expressway from Greater Noida to Balia will cover many of the fields in the village. The government claim that it will bring prosperity, but the villagers doubt this. Residence Khulua is a traditional Indian village. The Caste System continues to persist in this village. It can be easily observed during conflict situation, election wave, festival springs. The caste hierarchy continues as Kshatriya, Brahmin, OBC (Yadav, Kumhar, Muslim) and Schedule caste (Chamar,Pasi,),Schedule tribe( Mushahar). Practice of untouchability can be seen in the region including the village. Social harmony is sometimes disturbed by some people of upper and lower caste. Education Availability of primary and secondary education institution is major achievement of this tiny village. Government has set up primary school. It also has private school for primary education. There is a girls school for higher secondary education. An intermediate college for boys is also established with the help of villagers. Currently more than 2000 students are enrolled in this school from other neighbouring regions. Vindhyachal A few miles away from this village is a site of pilgrimage to Hindus known as Vindhyachal where according to the mythology a part of Sati (an Avatar of Durga) fell. The river Ganges flows through this village. Other sites of pilgrimage include Kali Khoh (literally 'the cave of the Goddess Kali') where a statue of the Kali has a mouth formed in the shape of a cave, hence the name.

The site is bounded to the west by Cheshunt and Turnford and Fishers Green and Holyfield to the east.River Lee Country Park Retrieved 11 September 2008 Description The SSSI includes ten former gravel pits, part of the Small River Lea, a further waterbody, Hall Marsh Scrape, which was constructed specifically for use by waterfowl. Also included in the site are areas of marsh, grassland, ruderal herbs, scrubland and woodland. The pits which include North Metropolitan Pit known as Northmetpit was excavated in the 1940s to Hooks Marsh Lake which was dug in the 1970s and cover a span of over 40 years. The site are of national importance for the wintering gadwall and the wintering northern shoveler and of regional importance for wintering coot and locally important for wintering snipe and the bittern. Breeding bird species of local importance include the great crested grebe, tufted duck, coot, little ringed plover, sedge warbler and the reed warbler. Many species of aquatic invertebrates have been recorded from the site especially damselflies and dragonflies including the scarce hairy dragonfly which has bred on the site and the red eyed damselfly is found in abundance. The various pits support varied aquatic and marinal flora including the nationally scarce whorled water milfoil. Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed and the brown sedge. Many of the spits and islands have developed into areas of scrubland and woodland mostly of willow species and alder. To the west of the North Metropolitan pit is the Nightingale Wood. This large block of woodland provides roosting and feeding sites for wintering and migratory passerine birds. The nationally scarce musk beetle Aromia moschata is also present in these areas. Several pits have developed marsh and rank grassland, their principal value is for invertebrates, particularly an area close to Bowyer's Water where grasshoppers and bush-crickets are present. This orthopteran fauna is believed to be the richest in Hertfordshire and includes several species more associated with coastal sites, such as the lesser marsh grasshopper and the nationally scarce roesel's bush-cricket. Small River Lea Several areas of former gravel pit have been infilled with power station pulverised fuel ash, much of which was transported to the site by barge via the River Lee Navigation. Much of the reclaimed land is poorly drained and exerts a strong calcareous influence on the vegetation. The area supports some of the largest colonies of marsh orchid in Essex and Hertfordshire. Other orchids present in large numbers are the early marsh orchid and southern marsh orchid, also present in smaller numbers are the common spotted orchid and various hybrids between these species. To the north of the site at Turnford Pit North, are a number of small areas of grassland believed to represent relics of the habitat which preceded gravel extraction. These fragments of agriculturally unimproved grassland are of a dry, rather calcareous, type which is rarely found in a river valley. Plant species which are present here include the cowslip, wild carrot and the common centaury. The site also supports a wide range of mammals, reptiles and amphibians: including otter, harvest mice and a large population of grass snake. Turnford Pits Public access The nearest station is Cheshunt railway station. Car parking is available adjacent to the site. Cycling and pedestrian access via the Lea Valley Walk.

Signature offers a portfolio of qualifications in British Sign Language and other forms of communication with deaf and deafblind people. Qualification portfolio All of Signature's qualifications are accredited by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and appear on the National Vocational Qualification framework. Signature Qualifications are available at centres across the UK. The full list of Signature qualifications is as follows: BSL/ISL *Level 1 Certificate in BSL/ISL *Level 2 Certificate in BSL/ISL *Level 3 Certificate in BSL/ISL *Level 3 NVQ in BSL/ISL *Level 4 NVQ in BSL/ISL *Level 4 NVQ in Interpreting (BSL/English) Deaf Awareness/Issues *Level 1 Award in Deaf Awareness and Communication *Level 2 Certificate in Communication with Deaf People *Level 2 Certificate in Communication with Deafblind People *Level 2 Certificate in Communication with Deafblind People (manual) *Level 3 Certificate in Facilitating Communication with Deaf People (Lipspeaking Skills) *Level 3 Certificate in Facilitating Communication with Deaf People (Notetaking Skills) *Level 3 Certificate for LSPs working with Deaf and Deafblind People (Lipspeaking) *Level 3 Certificate for LSPs working with Deaf and Deafblind People (Notetaking) Vision The collective vision of Signature is one of an inclusive society where deaf people experience no communication barriers. In its 25 years the charity has raised awareness and promoted skills, and standards, in the languages and communication methods that deaf people use. Signature have overcome many obstacles to become the recognised professional registration body for interpreters, lipspeakers, speech-to-text-reporters and others providing language access services, and one of the top awarding bodies in the UK. Deaf people are still excluded, overlooked and discriminated against in our society. There are far too few professionals offering language access services. CACDP know too few schools teach BSL or even tactics for communicating with deaf people. We know far too few people are formally qualified to teach BSL. Signature's work remains as important now as it was on the day the charity was established. Signature exists to provide knowledge and recognise skills in the languages and communication methods used by deaf people. Over twenty-five years Signature has been highly successful, more than 280,000 candidates have entered for assessments and the number of professionals registered to offer language access services has grown to over 600. Signature's work has also had an appreciable effect on public policy and service provision helping to shift the emphasis from a paternalistic welfare model to one based on rights and inclusion. Signature has been privileged to contribute to several important developments in their sector. Every Sign Language Interpreter, Lipspeaker and Speech-to-text reporter now working in courts and police stations must be Signature registered. Projects to improve inclusion for deaf people in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales backed by the devolved administrations are in various states of development and delivery. The report on access to communication in English for deaf people has raised awareness of the access issues for the greatest number of deaf people. Until 2009 Signature was known by the name CACDP.

In some states de Negker's name appears below the image. Woodcut by Hans Burgkmair, c. 1510, cut by Jost de Negker, this hand-coloured impression printed by his son David some decades later - woodcut blocks, if looked after, have a very long life. Jost de Negker (c. 1485‚Äì1544) was a cutter of woodcuts and also a printer and publisher of prints during the early 16th century, mostly in Augsburg, Germany. He was a leading \\"formschneider\\" or blockcutter of his day, but always to the design of an artist. He is \\"closely tied to the evolution of the fine woodcut in Northern Europe\\".Parshall, 200, see also Von der Osten & Vey. On block-cutting in general, and de Negker in particular, drawing on Landau & Parshall, see Woods, 216-218 For Adam von Bartsch, although he did not usually design or draw, the quality of his work, along with that of Hans L√ºtzelburger and Hieronymus Andreae, was such that he should be considered as an artist.Triumph of the Emperor Maximilian I, Adam Von Bartsch, reprint by BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008 (online), , Some prints where the designer is unknown are described as by de Negker, but it is assumed there was an artist who drew the design, although it has been suggested that de Negker might fill in a landscape background to a drawing of a figure.McDonald illustrates two prints \\"by\\" Negker in this sense (pp. 60 and 228) and suggested that Negker \\"filled in\\" the extensive landscape background to the second, which has obvious failings of perspective. Born in Antwerp c.1485, he worked as a cutter in the Netherlands to 1508, when a print he cut by Lucas van Leyden was published. He probably moved in that year to Augsburg (certainly before 1512) and worked for Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor on his print projects, as well as cutting blocks from designs by Hans Burgkmair the Elder and others. He was probably not used by Burgkmair in 1508 on his first chiaroscuro woodcut, for which precise cutting was essential to align the multiple blocks, but was working with him by 1510 on later works. Later states (in effect editions) of Burgkmair's two earliest chiaroscuro woodcuts, the equestrian portraits of Saint George and the Emperor Maximilian on horseback, and other Burgkmair prints, carry Negker's name and sometimes address, suggesting he owned the blocks, and was acting as publisher, though it is now thought that he may not have cut the earliest ones himself.Landau and Parshall, 200-202 & passim. See also Bartrum, No.s 132-137 & others. For full details of the states, search Dodgson's British Museum printed catalogue, available online. For St George, Negker's name first appears on state IV/VI, for Maximilian, III/VII. In 1512 de Negker wrote a long letter to the Emperor, in itself an indication of his status, which among other things makes it clear that he had been working on Maximilian's projects for some time, and had two assistants, paid via himself.Online translation in Woods, see also Landau and Parshall, 207-209, and also 216 and Hieronymus Andreae for Maximilian's visits to Andeae's workshop. As Maximilian's programme expanded, the signatures of eight different cutters are found on the reverse of blocks (surviving in the Albertina, Vienna) from 1516‚Äì18, including that of the other great cutter of the period, Hans L√ºtzelburger. Negker still seems to have been the co- ordinator of the cutting side of the projects, though Albrecht D√ºrer brought in his own man, the difficult Hieronymus Andreae, for the Triumphal Arch.Landau and Parshall, 207-209 Giulia Bartrum says that the \\"Imperial commissions enabled the block-cutter and printer Jost de Negker to raise the status of his profession to an unprecedentedly high level.\\"Bartrum, 130 On Maximilian's death in 1519, the large teams assembled for his projects dispersed, and de Negker became as much a publisher as a cutter,Landau and Parshall, 212 & Bartrum, 10-11 retaining many blocks by Burgkmair, Hans Weiditz and others,McDonald, 174 for a Weiditz portrait of Charles V of 1519. and infringing many works such as the Dance of Death by Holbein, L√ºtzelburger's masterpiece as a cutter. Negker's edition of this was published in 1544, and is his last known work. The cutters of most \\"single-leaf\\" woodcuts (prints) produced at the period are unknown, as they were usually only credited on the printed piece if they also acted as publisher, or at least printer. If the original block has survived these may be marked or signed, as they normally were in the case of Maximilian's projects, to ensure the right cutter was paid from the large teams. In the absence of other evidence, it is not usually worthwhile to speculate on the identity of a cutter based on style or quality,Of the prints, that is - a study by Laschitzer of the Maximilian blocks found that differences between individual cutters' techniques were much more evident on the blocks than in the prints. so many single prints cut by Negker during these years probably remain untraceable in the large production of the period. With books there is more evidence, from title-pages. He is attributed with the cutting of the German chiaroscuro woodcut with the largest number of different colour blocks, a seven-block coat of arms by Hans Weiditz (1520) used as a book frontispiece.Bartrum, 162 Jost de Negker's business was continued until at least the mid 1560s by his son David de Negker, who inherited his blocks and after leaving Augsburg also worked in Leipzig and Vienna. Another (presumed) son, Samson, also cut blocks.Bartrum, 154, and Landau and Parshall, 212 (& n. 93) Notes References *Bartrum, Giulia; German Renaissance Prints, 1490-1550; British Museum Press, 1995, *David Landau & Peter Parshall, The Renaissance Print, Yale, 1996, * Mark McDonald, Ferdinand Columbus, Renaissance Collector, 2005, British Museum Press, . *Gert von der Osten & Horst Vey 'Painting and Sculpture in Germany and the Netherlands' 1969. *Thieme-Becker Kunstler Lexicon. *Woods, Kim, Making Renaissance Art: Renaissance Art Reconsidered, Yale University Press, 2007, , .

The Sail and Steam Navy List: All the Ships of the Royal Navy 1815-1889 by Rif Winfield and David Lyon is a historical reference work providing details of all recorded ships in commission or intended to serve in the Royal Navy from 1815 to 1889. Where available in Admiralty records (from which all the data is sourced), it gives the location of construction, dates of construction (ordering, keel laying, launch and commissioning), principal dimensions and tonnage, armament, machinery (for steam vessels) and fate of every ship of the Royal Navy over the period. David Lyon's The Sailing Navy List: All the Ships of the Royal Navy, Built, Purchased and Captured, 1688-1860 had been published in 1993, a ground-breaking study of the sailing vessels of the Royal Navy from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until the close of the Age of Sail. He had planned a follow-up on the ships of the Royal Navy in the era of transition from sail to steam power, and began work in preparation for that volume. This was cut short by his death in a diving accident during 2000 in the Bahamas (he was an enthusiastic underwater archaeologist). Shortly after his death, his colleague Rif Winfield, author of the best-selling Fifty Gun Ship, and subsequently the author of a series of volumes under the heading British Warships in the Age of Sail, took over David's accumulated notes, added them to his own extensive research on Royal Naval warships, and carried on this work to produce what the Journal for Maritime Research described as The book is a valuable reference work and the only complete single-volume published record for ships of the late Georgian era (1714-1837) and of the early (1837-1860) and middle (1860-1889) Victorian Royal Navy. Rif Winfield's subsequent four-volume British Warships in the Age of Sail series has expanded this material to incorporate all vessels of the British (before 1704, English) Navy between 1603 and 1863, and incorporated the results of extra research since the publication of their Sail and Steam Navy List.

History Originally two old cottages were used by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SPCK) as a church. Augustus Smith provided funds to make the building cruciform, adding a north transept (the cottages formed an aisle with south transept) and an eastern end. According to tradition a gallery was constructed from the timbers of a ship wrecked on St Helen's; increasing the capacity to 200. Edith Dorrien-Smith laid the foundation stone of the Anglican church of St Nicholas on 12 September 1877, near the old building. The principal benefactor was Lady Sophia Tower. The church was opened for worship on 17 June 1879 by Edward White Benson, the first Bishop of Truro. It was consecrated on 16 July 1882, a delay due to an undisclosed ‚Ä≥legal difficulty‚Ä≥. The dedication of the church to St Nicholas is the same as the dedication of the medieval Tresco Abbey, the remains of which are in Tresco Abbey Gardens. The new churchyard included the old one, and was planted with aloes, dracaenas, flowering plants and evergreens. The three-panelled reredos is made of red serpentine and inlaid with a marble cross, aureola and sacred emblems. It was fixed in position in May 1879. The font is also made of serpentine, mounted on small granite columns. The reredos and font were manufactured by Messrs Bradbury at their serpentine manufactury at the Folly, Penzance.

Re- building was carried out between 1660 and 1667 including the addition of the south aisle, and a west end gallery for soldiers from the Garrison.

He advocates replacing priority (an engineering model) with equality (a social model) to provide a level playing-field on which all road-users can act sociably. This, he says, would remove the \\"need\\" for most traffic controls, and solve many of our road safety and congestion problems, which stem from those very controls. Cassini has contributed to Economic Affairs (journal of the Institute of Economic Affairs), The Times, Guardian, Daily Telegraph, BBC Newsnight and Traffic Technology International. Cassini's reforms overlap with the shared space movement of Hans Monderman and Ben Hamilton-Baillie, which is demonstrating in Bohmte and Drachten that peaceful coexistence can flourish when road-users are free to use their own judgement on roads designed to stimulate rather than enforce appropriate conduct. His ideas also echo the theory of spontaneous order, which states that the more complex the dance of human movement (e.g. a skateboard park), the less useful are attempts to control it. Cassini helped instigate a lights-off trial in Portishead, Somerset, which began on 14 September 2009. Conducted in association with North Somerset Council and Colin Buchanan, it went permanent after journey times fell by over 50% with no loss of pedestrian safety, despite greater numbers now using the route (over 2000 vehicles and 300 pedestrians an hour). Minor trials took place in Westminster, Oxford, and Bristol in 2009. But deregulation is not enough on its own, says Cassini. It needs to be accompanied by changes in road design, culture, the driving test and the law. Cassini is a member of the International Advisory Council of the Kyoto World Cities New Mobility Program.

Life In his M√©moires, Carlo Goldoni says he first met Bigottini in Rimini in 1741, where the latter was playing harlequin r√¥les. From the 1750s Bigottini appeared in the Netherlands, Austrian Netherlands and France, playing in Rotterdam in 1754, Brussels in 1756, and in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien in 1757. Gueullette wrote \\"On Wednesday 26 April [1757], an Italian harlequin called Bigottini made his d√©but in \\"Arlequin Scanderberg\\" and \\"Arlequin Hulla\\"; in the former, he played a r√¥le as a master of music very well, and played very badly in \\"Arlequin Hulla\\"; he was sent packing shortly afterwards\\". Bigottini left for the French provinces and acted in Marseille in 1760, where he put on his own play Coraline Prot√©e (1761). He was in Geneva from 1766 to 1768, where he printed his play L'Origine d'Arlequin, avec sa naissance (1766). The Mercure de France wrote that he was the \\"first inventor of the machines used in the metamorphosis in the F√©e Urgelle in Geneva\\" (that is, the transformation of a cottage into a splendid castle). After playing in Lyon, Bigottini travelled towards Spain and spent three years playing at the Italian opera-house in C√°diz, from which he negotiated to be taken on at Brussels Th√©√¢tre de la Monnaie. In one of his letters, he wrote to that theatre's heads, Vitzthumb and Compain \\"I have nearly all my sets and machines for my plays, and I would thus also furnish you with all that I have, sets, machines, ropes, pulleys, scrap and all the other \\"diableries\\", if you would be furnish me with the wood\\". They finally took him on as a harlequin for the 1774-1775 season, with his contract stipulating that he would \\"lend [the theatre] all his machines and sets\\". On 18 February 1777, he made a second d√©but at the Th√©√¢tre-Italien, in Arlequin esprit follet, a play he had written himself. The Mercure de France wrote: \\"His metamorphoses are very numerous and very surprising. Mr Bigottini is admired for the variety of his changes, by their speed and attack with which he executes them, by the contrast he makes between his different r√¥les, and by the varied talents he develops. This actor sings, in a strong and pleasing manner, airs of his own composition.\\". However, after the suppression of the Italian theatrical genre in Paris at the start of 1780, Bigottini was dismissed with a compensation corresponding to his previous salary. In January 1780, he collaborated with Fran√ßois Duval-Malter, Louis Hamoir and Jean-Nicolas Le Mercier to head the Th√©√¢tre des Vari√©t√©s-Amusantes, but had to give up this post 11 months later due to his own financial difficulties.

Introduced shortly after the electrification of the suburban rail system in Melbourne, Australia, and based on the same electrical and traction equipment as Melbourne's early suburban electric multiple unit fleet, they provided power for suburban goods services and shunting for six decades. History With the rapid expansion of Melbourne's suburban electrification scheme, becoming by 1924 the largest in the world at 346 miles (557 km), the Victorian Railways decided to utilise the advantages of electric traction for suburban goods services, which until then had been hauled by steam locomotives such as the Y class 0-6-0, E class 2-4-2T and later Dde class 4-6-2T. In 1923 it introduced two electric locomotives of 620 hp (460 kW), built at VR's Newport and Jolimont Workshops with the same General Electric traction motors and related electrical equipment that had been installed in Melbourne's Tait and Swing Door electric suburban train sets, with the notable exception of the deadman's handle because the driver would always have a second person with them,Newsrail April 1984 p.100 and because unnecessary activation of the emergency brake could damage goods loadings and delay following trains. Production The first two locomotives were built with a steeplecab-style appearance. Despite their appearance and unlike other steeplecab locomotives, they also included a large amount of the electrical equipment including the dynamotor in the driver's cab. The exposure of the driver to this electrical equipment led to them being nicknamed \\"electric chairs\\" among drivers. The two were designed as \\"E\\" Class engines, but issued to service only with numbers 1100 and 1101.http://pjv101.net/cd/pages/c557m.htm Following a 1926 review into suburban goods traffic a further fleet of engines were ordered to a modified design. These had a box-cab design on a longer frame with end platforms for crew access to the cabs, and two pantographs. These engines quickly gained the nickname \\"butterboxes\\", or occasionally \\"black engines\\" to distinguish them from all the \\"red rattlers\\". 1102 and 1103 entered service in 1928, followed by the rest o the class up to 1111 in 1929. It is thought that the original order was for only seven new engines, but some design documents refer to 1113 implying a total order of up to 12 additional units. Around the time of the first L Class locomotives, the butterbox engines started to have \\"E\\" letter plates affixed adjacent to the cabside and end handrail number plates as they were recovered from scrapped E Class steam engines. The two steeple-cab engines never had these \\"E\\" plates fitted. Regular service Upon introduction, the two steeple-cab locomotives proved the superiority of electric traction. They were able to operate together with multiple-unit train control, allowing a single crew to control both as an articulated locomotive with greater tractive effort than the Victorian Railways C class heavy goods locomotive, the most powerful steam locomotive on the VR at the time. Based on their success, suburban goods sidings were rapidly electrified and most suburban goods traffic utilised electric traction. With the electrification of the Gippsland line as far as Traralgon in the 1950s, the range of the E class locomotives was similarly extended and they could be found shunting or hauling services along the line. Locomotives 1100 to 1111 were painted in a plain black livery, matching that of the VR steam locomotive fleet. During the 1960s the ten box-cabs were painted in a variation of the blue and gold livery applied to the VR diesel fleetm starting with E1111 on 13 November 1965. The locomotives were initially based at the Jolimont Workshops along with the suburban electric multiple unit fleet, as steam locomotives were housed at the North Melbourne Locomotive Depot. However with the opening of the new South Dynon Locomotive Depot in 1964, the entire E class fleet was relocated there in June 1968. When the boxcab engines were fitted with automatic couplers the frames were raised by about two inches, and the buffers lowered by the same amount, to gain clearance over the traction motors for the drawgear and associated equipment. The locomotives were fitted with dual couplers, where the head of the automatic coupler could be rotated out of the way to expose an older-style hook-and-chain coupler set. Demise The first two steeple-cab locomotives were \\"slightly damaged\\" due to a runaway incident in Fairfield in 1954 and withdrawn. The damage would have been repairable, but the engines could not be fitted with automatic couplers (possibly due to the shorter frame) and so they were scrapped in July 1955, By this time, the electric locomotive fleet had been substantially expanded with L class locomotives of a far more modern design. The box-cab E class locomotives continued in service. However, during the 1970s, Victorian Railways conducted detailed studies of goods traffic and found that handling costs made the transport of high rated, small freight items unprofitable. As a result of these studies, rail freight operations were rationalised around block trains carrying bulk freight such as gravel, rice or grain, and suburban goods sidings were closed in favour of road freight services. Furthermore, the use of block trains greatly reduced the need for shunting locomotives. These operational changes rendered the ageing E class suburban electric locomotives surplus, and by 1981 scrappings had commenced. The last was withdrawn from service in 1984. Preservation E 1102, preserved at the ARHS North Williamstown Railway Museum Four E class locomotives have survived into preservation. As of May 2007, their disposition was as follows: *E 1102 was in static preservation at the Australian Railway Historical Society Williamstown Railway Museum, wearing its original black livery *E 1106 and 1108 were stored out of service by Steamrail Victoria *E 1109 is also in the custody of Steamrail Victoria, and is a long term restoration project.

Life and work Watson was born at his father's estate, Overmains, Berwickshire, in 1767, the son of Frances Veitch of Elliott. John Watson. He received his early education in Edinburgh, and got some instruction in painting from Alexander Nasmyth but when 18 years of age he went to London with an introduction to Sir Joshua Reynolds, who received him as a pupil. After two years spent in Reynolds' studio, he returned to Edinburgh, and established himself as a portrait-painter. In 1808 he was associated with other painters in starting a society of artists, which, however, only lasted a few years. He exhibited frequently at the Royal Academy and the British Institution, and about 1815 was invited to London to paint a number of portraits, including those of the dean of Canterbury and Benjamin West. In 1820, in spite of much opposition from the Royal Institution, the Scottish Academy was founded, and Watson, who had been president of the previous society, was elected to the same office in the new one, the ultimate success of which was largely due to his tact and ability. He continued as president until his death, the academy receiving its royal charter a few months afterwards.

He is represented in the National Gallery of Scotland by portraits of two brother artists, Benjamin West and two of Archibald Skirving; and in the Scottish Portrait Gallery by a number of portraits, including one of himself, and one of William Smellie, which some consider his best piece of work.

The story revolves around a young couple, Daniel Da Barca and Marisa Mallo. Their happiness is destroyed when Galicia falls under a Falangist dictatorship. What follows is a poor summary of the book, but instead relies on the plot of a movie based on the Rivas's novel. The plot Dr Daniel Da Barca is a left-wing political activist who believes that women should have the right to vote in Galicia. He attends many rallies and gives speeches, always accompanied by his devoted girlfriend Marisa Mallo. Unbeknown to Da Barca, he has been watched by Herbal, an agent for the Civil Guard. When the Falanxists take control of the country, Da Barca is arrested for his left wing ideals in Santiago de Compostela. Meanwhile, Marisa's father Don Benito is trying to marry her off to Alejandro, a lieutenant in the Falanxist army. Marisa confides in her cousin, Laura that she cannot forget about Da Barca and is determined to get the condemned doctor out of prison. Beforehand Marisa had visited Daniel in the prison and he ordered her to forget about him and move on with her life. The prison is run by the cruel and sadistic Zalo Puga, a high ranking Falanxist. Zalo is married to Herbal's sister, Beatriz. Zalo holds an intense and burning hatred for all left wingers, and especially Da Barca. When the prisoner, Gonzalo Rincon is tortured and murdered by Zalo and two other Falanxists he drops his pencil, which is picked up by Herbal. The Civil Guard keeps the pencil for his own. Meanwhile, Da Barca has been allowed to help out in the prison ward, due to his medical practices. He works alongside a nun Mother Izarne, with whom Da Barca develops a genuine friendship and Dr Solans. Solans has been stealing morphine from the ward to feed his own addiction to the drug. It soon becomes clear to Da Barca, that most of the prisoners could be cured of their illness by a healthy diet such as fruit. When he tries to acquire this, he is beaten by Herbal and the other guards. Marisa is desperate to secure Da Barca's release, and pleads with her father to write to his influential friends to negotiate the doctor's release. Don Benito refuses, and Marisa attempts suicide. She fails in her attempt and it is this act, that finally convinces Don Benito to write letters. He hands them to Marisa, and tells her to deliver them to his friends like the Archbishop of Santiago and The Mayor of Vigo. Marisa delivers them happily, unbeknown that her father has actually betrayed her. In the letter, Benito has written that Da Barca must be executed for the good of the Falanxist cause. The movie continues with Da Barca trying to survive the harsh and brutal conditions in the prison, whilst at the same time trying to help his fellow inmates through illness and despair.

The bean-shaped hill measures about 5 km north-south by 13 km east-west. It rises to a maximum of 371 m elevation from the alluvial plain of the Piave River, which runs along the north and west edges of the hill, at about 140 m elevation. Montello is crossed in the east-west direction by a local road that begins as Via 18 Giugno in the town of Pederiva di Biadene, continues as Strada La Dorsale and Via Frati, and ends as Via Ossario in the town of Nervesa della Battaglia. Several local roads in the general north-south direction connect this \\"dorsal spine\\" of the Montello to the two main alternative routes around the hill, either along on its southern margin (comprised by Stradone del Bosco, Via Fra Giocondo, Via Pedemontana, Via Francesco Baracca, Via Arditi, Via Armando Diaz) or along the northern margin (the Panoramic Road, comprised by Via Gabriele d'Annunzio, Via Nord Montello, Via Riviera Piave, Via Decima Armata). The hill gave its name to several towns nested against its base Crocetta del Montello, Montebelluna, Volpago del Montello, Giavera del Montello, and Nervesa della Battaglia. The hill is covered with a mix of wooded areas, residential homes, and small farms. The church and monument of Santa Maria della Vittoria, built after the battle of 1918, is located on top of Montello, about 3.5 km north of Volpago (to which it belongs) and 5 km east from Pederiva. History Montello has been inhabited since pre-historical times; chipped stone points from the Mesolithic have been found along the northern edge. The early inhabitants probably occupied the many natural caves that bore into the hill. In Classical Antiquity the region surrounding Montello was settled by reformed soldiers of the Roman army. During the Middle Ages, the Certosa (Carthusian monastery) of San Gerolamo and the abbey of Sant'Eustachio were built. It was in the latter that, between 1550 and 1555, Giovanni Della Casa wrote Il Galateo'. The oaks and chestnut trees that covered Montello since antiquity used to be a major source of timber for the region, especially for the shipyards and building foundations of Venice. Due to its strategic importance, the Republic of Venice assumed the ownership of the hill, and declared it off-limits to the local population. Deprived of their homes and their main source of income, the hunters and woodsmen of Montello became a class of landless, homeless and jobless miserables, the bisnenti (the 'twice have-nots'), who survived on odd jobs and occasionally crimes. Eventually, many locals took to the roads of emigration, in the Americas, France, Germany and Australia. In 1892, moved by the plight of the bisnenti, Senator Pietro Bertolini pushed through legislation which parcelled Montello land among them. The initiative was not very successful, since the poor soil was not very suitable for agriculture. In any case, the re-settlement and the ravages of World War I led to the demise of the native woods, and their partial replacement by robinias, a bush native to the Americas that was brought to the region in the late 18th century. On July 24, 1930, Montello area was affected by an extremely violent tornado, probably the strongest in Europe in historical times, with gusts estimated at 500 km/h and an estimated ranking of F5 on the Fujita scale. It was strong enough to level masonry buildings, and it caused the death of at least 23 people.

Plot synopsis In desolate farm country in Georgia, the profitable tobacco crop has given way to cotton plantations, but poor planting practices have depleted the soil. The Lester family were once sharecroppers, but are now poverty- stricken and unable to cope with the bleak life they face. Jeeter Lester, the patriarch, lives in squalor with his wife Ada, their two children, 16-year-old Dude and 18-year-old Ellie May, and his mother. Ada is suffering from pellagra and Ellie May has a harelip, Jeeter and Dude are thin and emaciated, and the family wears tattered clothing. Sister Bessie Rice, a stout preacher of about 40, decides to marry Dude, who agrees when she promises to buy him a car. When Capt. Tim Harmon tells the family that the house and property are owned by the bank, Jeeter is given a chance to earn money so that they may keep living there, but he refuses. The youngest daughter Pearl tries to escape from her much older husband Lov Bensey, but Ada is run over by Dude's car as she attempts to help Pearl. As Ada lies dying, Pearl escapes and runs away; Jeeter sends Ellie May to Lov instead.

The show also toured, becoming \\"phenomenal\\" on the road, playing repeat engagements.New York Times, \\"Tobacco Road Retires Tonight Undefeated\\", May 31, 1941, p.13 Critics differed as to whether Tobacco Road should be seen primarily as a tragedy, a comedy, or a \\"social document\\" in the tradition of Zola or Gorky.Schildcrout, p. 41. Brock Pemberton imagined a scientific analysis of the play would reveal \\"two principal elements are equal proportions of impure, adulterous sex and blasphemous, profane, elemental comedy, with a slight residuum of social documentation.\\"Schildcrout, pp. 41-42. Brooks Atkinson wrote: \\"The theatre has never sheltered a fouler or more degenerate parcel of folks than the hardscrabble family of Lester...It is the blunt truth of the characters he is describing, and it leaves a malevolent glow of poetry... As Jeeter Lester, Henry Hull gives the performance of his career. Plays as clumsy and rudderless as 'Tobacco Road' seldom include so many scattered items that leave such a vivid impression.\\"New York Times, \\"Henry Hull in 'Tobacco Road'\\", December 5, 1933, p.31 The play was banned in major cities such as Chicago and Detroit for being sensational and immoral.Frank, Leah.\\"Shocks Dissipated In 'Tobacco Road' \\" New York Times, October 13, 1985 Contemporary scholar Jordan Schildcrout wrote: \\"Tobacco Road remains a challenging play precisely because it doesn't clearly express a single ideological perspective. Are the poor responsible for their own condition, thus relieving the viewer of any sense of responsibility, or is poverty a social and political issue that demands action?

Archibald Higgins is the main character of the scientific comics series of \\"The Adventures of Archibald Higgins\\", created by the French astrophysicist Jean-Pierre Petit as a translation of his French series \\"Les Aventures d'Anselme Lanturlu\\" first created in 1980. The series was initially published by Editions Belin. Curious and candid, Archibald's adventures are a pretext for the popularization of science in fields ranging from physics to computer science, helped in this by the charming Sophie who guides him in his efforts while letting him search, as well as by three very learned animals: Leon the pelican, Max the bird and Tiresias the snail. The albums are filled with encounters with characters from well-known scientists from different periods (Einstein or Jean-Marie Souriau for example). This series is the first example in the history of real science education through comics. It is not a comic strip that would take place in the scientific community: the objective is to acquire scientific knowledge. It was born from many drawings that the author had to create in order to teach physical sciences and geometry to philosophy students at the Faculty of Aix-en-Provence. The scientific level of the target readership is very diverse: some albums can be understood by high school students, most by science graduates, some require a first university level in mathematics. This science comics series explains mainly highly advanced scientific concepts : cosmology, general relativity, topology, anatomy, MHD, fluid mechanics, astrophysics, geometry, economy, aeronautics...Presentation (fr) of the association Savoir sans Fronti√®res : interview by France Inter radio http://www.savoir-sans- frontieres.com/JPP/franceinter_ssf.mp3 Since 2005, the association Savoir sans Frontieres organises the professional translation (in 40 languages as of Nov. 2018) and the free download of all the albums as webcomics in PDF format.The association Savoir sans Frontieres is mentioned in this interview by La Voix de la Russie, 2014/02, (fr), https://web.archive.org/web/20140306140216/http://french.ruvr.ru/2014_02_17/Jean- Pierre-Petit-les-dechets-nucleaires-bombe-a-retardement-planetaire- Partie-1-1359The association Savoir sans Frontieres is mentioned in this interview by Les Inrockuptibles, 2012/09, (fr) https://www.lesinrocks.com/2012/09/17/actualite/jirai-dormir-chez-les- complotistes-11302064/  Dissemination of the series  Editions Belin has published fourteen hard cover albums.

She was the first female newscaster on television in Los Angeles and the West Coast. She has received many awards and honors, including a Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Biography A native of Los Angeles, Ruth Ashton graduated in 1939 from Long Beach Polytechnic High School. Taylor completed her undergraduate degree at Scripps College. She relocated to New York City thereafter, receiving a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1944.Biagi, Shirley. (1992-08-19) Ruth Ashton Taylor introduction Washington Press Club Foundation. Retrieved 2008-09-03. Following her graduation, she took a job as a news writer at CBS radio, taking a place among the original members of the documentary unit of Edward R. Murrow. When she first began as a writer and producer there, she had no thoughts of going on air as, to her knowledge, it simply wasn't done in major news markets. According to Ashton, CBS management didn't want to broadcast women because they \\"just didn't like those squeaky voices\\". However, by 1949, she was on the air, interviewing such notable individuals as Albert Einstein. Eventually, she was transferred to a religious program, and, disappointed by her exclusion from news broadcasting, she left CBS radio in New York and returned to Los Angeles. In 1951, she became the first woman in Los Angeles or on the West Coast on television news when she took a job with LA's KNXT-TV (now KCBS). Although originally hired to cover the \\"Women's Angle\\", she has indicated in interviews that the lack of conventional roles for women in broadcasting gave her considerable freedom in the stories she selected to cover. In 1958, she left briefly to work as a public information officer at a college before returning in 1962. She officially retired in 1989, but continued occasionally contributing into her 70s. As a news reporter and program host, she became an influential figure on subsequent female journalists, with numerous industry awards and a career that included notable interviews with such diverse people as Jimmy Carter and Jimmy Durante. During her time in broadcasting, Ashton Taylor became a widely known and celebrated figure. In 1983, The Los Angeles Times indicated that she had a reputation as \\"one of the best newspeople in television\\". A 2007 article in the Journal of Broadcasting & Electronic Media described her as \\"one of the most recognizable people on radio and television in Los Angeles\\" She received a Star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990. Other notable honors include a Governors Award for Lifetime Achievement bestowed by the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and a Diamond Achievement Award from Women in Communications (1984).

It is located at 3, Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat, on the edge of Brussels' Park, facing the Federal Parliament. It is served by Brussels metro stations Parc/Park and Arts-Loi/Kunst-Wet. History Built in 1782 to plans by the architect Louis Montoyer, the Park Theatre was at first an annex to the Theatre of La Monnaie. The brothers Alexandre and Herman Bultos exploited both theatres at the same time, with the Park Theatre used for plays featuring young actors, as a sort of drama school for La Monnaie. It was closed in 1807 by Napoleon's decree on the theatres, but re-opened in 1814, and was occupied by a British company for a year then a Dutch company for a few months. From 1819, the City of Brussels, owner of these two Royal Theatres, granted a concession to one director after another. The company and repertoire were identical yet distinct, with the Park Theatre specialising in vaudeville and boulevard theatre. From 1850 to 1854, the Park Theatre hosted Dutch productions, then specialised in operetta and op√©ra-comique, and finally (from 1869) in comedies. During the First World War, both theatres were requisitioned and the Park Theatre became a playhouse for the German garrison. Returning as a francophone theatre in 1919, it put on classic pieces featuring Belgian actors. Its current director is Thierry Debroux.
