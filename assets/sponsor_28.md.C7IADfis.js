It is the twentieth municipality in the region by population,Comuni calabresi per popolazione while for population densityComuni calabresi per densit√† it is ranked twenty-fourth place It is a tourist centre on the southern Tyrrhenian Sea coast.  History  Amantea appears as a centre of its own in the 7th century, although traces of human presence from pre-historical times onwards have been found in the area. In 839 the Arabs captured it, being ousted by the Byzantines in 889. Later it was under Norman domination. In 1269 the Amanteani rebelled against the Angevines in the name of Conradin of Hohenstaufen, but were besieged by the French and defeated. The town is mostly famous for the long resistance of its inhabitants against the French troops under Joseph Bonaparte who, in 1806‚Äì1807, attempted to conquer its castle. In July 1810, three British warships, the frigate , , and , captured or destroyed a convoy of 31 coasting vessels that were carrying stores and provisions from Naples to Murat's army at Scylla. Seven large gunboats, four scampavias and an armed pinnace protected the convoy. At the approach of the British warships the convoy and its escorts beached themselves in front of Amantea, but the British were still able to capture almost all the vessels, and destroy half a dozen, all while suffering only minimal casualties.  Main sights  *The Rocca (Castle). First built by the Byzantines, it was strengthened by the Arabs. The current cylindrical tower is however to the Norman-Hohenstaufen age. It was long besieged by Charles of Anjou's troops in 1269. It was nearly destroyed during the French siege in 1806-1807. It is now a public structure, but is abandoned. *Church of San Bernardino. *Palazzo delle Clarisse (17th century). The palace was built in the early seventeenth century as the Convent of the Poor Claires (Clarisse) and has remained a convent until 1806 when the French, as a result of the siege of Amantea, confiscated it along with other church properties and then sold it to the Marquis de Luca di Lizzano who made it his noble residence. The Marquis De Luca lived in the palace until 1977. Following a period of severe neglect and decay, the building was then purchased and restored by the current owner, Prof. Fausto Perri. The Palazzo delle Clarisse now hosts cultural and commercial activities such as concerts, exhibitions and paintings by the masters of the Atelier of Copyists, a highly specialized Italian laboratory with great tradition as well as a restaurant with a beautiful view of the sea. *Palazzo Mirabelli (17th century). *U Turriune (large tower, 14th century) at Campora San Giovanni. *Archaeological findings in the area of Campora San Giovanni. *Capuchins Church.

The city is at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level and overlooks the Ionian Sea.  History  The name probably derives from the Latin Amygdalaria (mandorlai), due to the area's high production of almonds. Based on archaeological sites in the area, it is believed that the territory was already inhabited in the Neolithic period (6000-4000 BC) and that the human presence became stable in the Proto-historic age (3500-3000 BC), when a community settled in the area of today's Old District (Rione Vecchio). With the foundation of Sybaris by the Achaeans, the population that inhabited the area of the Old District in the seventh century BC moved to the wide area of San Nicola. In this place was built a new city, called Lagaria. After the Roman rule, Amendolara was mostly a religious center, first under the Byzantines, then with the establishment of Cistercians monks, as evidenced by the many churches and hermits' caves located in the territory. A castle was built here around 1000 AD. In the 16th century the Dominicans built a convent and the so-called \\"Torre Spaccata\\" (\\"Split tower\\"). For two centuries there were battles between feudal lords and the city for the conquest of the land confiscated during the feudal period. In 18th centuries the lots became real farms and were divided between the municipality and the state, which sold them to the representatives of the most powerful middle- class families. During the 19th century Amendolara was a viable center for the dissemination of liberal ideas, but it is also suffered the plundering of the most important works of art contained in the churches. In 1848 the population was mostly living in poverty and they rebelled against the landowners occupying the lands of Straface. Poverty and unemployment led to a significant migration to Argentina and northern Italy which lasted for nearly a century.  Cuisine The food is a strong tradition and cultural tourist attraction of the place. It actively contributes to the local economy and society. The cuisine is simple, genuine, and uses local vegetables. The culinary tradition of Amendolara puts is based on agriculture of the \\"Alto Jonio Cosentino\\", and is characterized by the use of basic ingredients in common with the area of Sibari. A common first course is rascjcatilli, fresh pasta made with flour and water in the form of small pieces plucked with the fingers and topped with fresh tomato sauce and basil or lamb ragout and a sprinkling of chili pepper. Ferrazuoli is fresh pasta in the shape of sticks, gouged with a thin iron square, and topped with meat ragout. Both are peasant dishes, often enhanced by the intense flavor of ricotta cheese and grated flake directly over the plate at time of service. Typical Christmas desserts include I crispi, made with wheat flour, water and yeast, shaped like big rings, fried in olive oil, and topped with sugar icing. I cannaricoli are big dumplings made of flour, black pepper, wine and a pinch of yeast, then fried in olive oil. During Easter, it was common to prepare and . Cullura is the Easter bread, with an original meaning of new life. The dough is made with flour, eggs, cinnamon, fennel seeds, lard, salt and yeast. The whole is worked and shaped like a crown. Pastizzi are pseudo-pants made with flour, lard, salt and pepper, stuffed with meat and entrails of kid, seasoned with pepper, parsley, and garlic, browned in olive oil with the addition of sausage, then baked in the oven.

Life Webster answered an ad placed by William \\"Doc\\" Carver in 1923 for a diving girl and soon earned a place in circus history. Her job was to mount a running horse as it reached the top of a forty-foot (sometimes sixty-foot) tower and sail down on its back as it plunged into an 11-foot pool of water directly below. She was a sensation and soon became the lead diving girl for Doc's act as they traveled the country and the first diving girl quit. Sonora fell in love with and eventually married Doc's son, Albert (Al) Floyd Carver, in October 1928. Al had taken over the show in 1927, after the death of Dr. Carver. Sonora's sister Arnette Webster French followed in her footsteps, becoming a horse diver and joining the show in 1928. In 1931, Sonora was blinded by retinal detachment, due to hitting the water off balance with her eyes open, while diving her horse, Red Lips, on Atlantic City's Steel Pier, the act's permanent home since 1929. After her accident she continued to dive horses until 1942. Arnette left the show in 1935. Arnette explained Sonora's decision to continue riding after her accident in this way: \\"Riding the horse was the most fun you could have and we just loved it so. We didn't want to give it up. Once you were on the horse, there really wasn't much to do but hold on. The horse was in charge.\\" Arnette, who was 15 when she took her first horse dive, remarked in an interview that \\"Wherever we went, the S.P.C.A. (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) was always snooping around, trying to find if we were doing anything that was cruel to animals. They never found anything because those horses lived the life of Riley. In all the years of the act, there was never a horse that was injured.\\" Sonora's account can be read in her 1961 book, A Girl and Five Brave Horses, and seen in the fictionalized movie version of her life, Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken, starring Gabrielle Anwar. She was disappointed in the way that the movie depicted her life and career. She remarked to Arnette after screening the film that \\"the only thing true in it was that I rode diving horses, I went blind, and I continued to ride for another 11 years.\\" Sonora died at the age of 99 on September 20, 2003.

The archaeological remains found there date the settlement back to the 15th or 14th century BC. In 1054 Bisignano was a free city. It became the residence of a Norman count and later a fief of the Orsini family. In 1641 it became a fief of the Sanseverino family, which it remained until 1806. According to Henry Yule, Giovanni de Marignolli, famous for his accounts of travels in China, was made bishop of Bisignano in 1354. \\"The bishop, however, seems to have been in no hurry to reside there; thinking perhaps that a man who had spent so many years of his life in travelling to Cathay and back might be excused from passing the whole of those that remained to him in the wilds of Calabria.\\"Cathay and the Way Thither: Being a Collection of Medieval Notices of China, Volume 2, ed.

Agriculture has prospered in the fertile valleys of the area. The town and the other four municipalities of the Calabrian district specialise in the cultivation and production of cereals, pasta, vegetables, fruit (citrons, bergamot oranges, oranges, clementine tangerines, lemons, grapefruit), savoury goat and sheep's milk cheeses (Caciocavallo silano in particular), hot red peppers, fine extra-virgin olive oil of medium-high quality (various types: slightly fruity, aromatised, organic and the more famous Bruzio DOP), robust and delicate wines (Donnici in particular) and sweets. The growing of olives destined to make DOP olive oil is important in the Crati valley. Greenhouse farming, holiday farms and the breeding of thoroughbred horses are also major activities.

It is a synthetically valuable method for obtaining substituted furans and pyrroles, common structural components of many natural products. It was initially reported independently by German chemists Carl Paal and Ludwig Knorr in 1884 as a method for the preparation of furans, and has been adapted for pyrroles and thiophenes. Although the Paal‚ÄìKnorr synthesis has seen widespread use, the mechanism wasn't fully understood until it was elucidated by V. Amarnath et al. in the 1990s. The furan synthesis requires an acid catalyst: :Paal‚ÄìKnorr furan synthesis In the pyrrole synthesis a primary amine participates: :Paal‚ÄìKnorr Pyrrole Synthesis and in that of thiophene for instance the compound phosphorus pentasulfide: :Paal-Knorr thiophene synthesis Mechanisms=Furan synthesis The acid catalyzed furan synthesis proceeds by protonation of one carbonyl which is attacked by the forming enol of the other carbonyl. Dehydration of the hemiacetal gives the resultant furan. Paal-Knorr furan synthesis mechanism The mechanism of the Paal‚ÄìKnorr furan synthesis was elucidated in 1995 by V. Amarnath et al. Amarnath's work showed that the diastereomers of 3,4-disubstituted-2,5-hexane diones react at different rates. In the commonly accepted mechanism, these diones would go through a common enol intermediate, meaning that the meso and d,l-racemic isomers would cyclize at the same rate as they form from a common intermediate. The implication of different reaction is that cyclization needs to occur in a concerted step with enol formation. Thus the mechanism was proposed to occur via attack of the protonated carbonyl with the forming enol. Amarnath also found that the unreacted dione had not undergone conformational isomerization, which also indicated that an enol was not an intermediate. Pyrrole synthesis The mechanism for the synthesis of the pyrrole was investigated by V. Amarnath et al. in 1991. His work suggests that the protonated carbonyl is attacked by the amine to form the hemiaminal. The amine attacks the other carbonyl to form a 2,5-dihydroxytetrahydropyrrole derivative which undergoes dehydration to give the corresponding substituted pyrrole. Paal‚ÄìKnorr pyrrole synthesis mechanism The reaction is typically run under protic or Lewis acidic conditions, with a primary amine. Use of ammonium hydroxide or ammonium acetate (as reported by Paal) gives the N-unsubstituted pyrrole. Thiophene synthesis Thiophene synthesis is achieved via a mechanism very similar to the furan synthesis. The initial diketone is converted to a thioketone with a sulfurizing agent, which then undergoes the same mechanism as the furan synthesis. Paal‚ÄìKnorr thiophene synthesis mechanism Most sulfurization agents are strong dehydrators and drive completion of the reaction. Early postulates toward the mechanism of the Paal- Knorr furan synthesis suggested that the thiophene was achieved by sulfurization of the furan product. Campaigne and Foye showed that treatment of isolated furans from the Paal-Knorr furan synthesis with phosphorus pentasulfide gave inconsistent results with the treatment of 1,4-dicarbonyls with phosphorus pentasulfide, which ruled out the sulfurization of a furan mechanism and suggests that the reaction proceeds via sulfurization of a dicarbonyl, producing a thioketone. Scope Pyrrole Ring The Paal‚ÄìKnorr reaction is quite versatile. In all syntheses almost all dicarbonyls can be converted to their corresponding heterocycle. R2 and R5 can be H, aryl or alkyl. R3 and R4 can be H, aryl, alkyl, or an ester. In the pyrrole synthesis (X = N), R1 can be H, aryl, alkyl, amino, or hydroxyl. A variety of conditions can be used to carry out these reactions, most of which are mild. The Paal‚ÄìKnorr Furan synthesis is normally carried out under aqueous acidic conditions with protic acids such as aqueous sulfuric or hydrochloric acid, or anhydrous conditions with a Lewis acid or dehydrating agent. Common dehydrating agents include phosphorus pentoxide, anhydrides, or zinc chloride. The pyrrole synthesis requires a primary amine under similar conditions, or ammonia (or ammonia precursors) can be used. Synthesis of a thiophene requires a sulfurizing agent which is typically a sufficient dehydrator, such as phosphorus pentasulfide, Lawesson's reagent, or hydrogen sulfide. Traditionally, the Paal‚ÄìKnorr reaction has been limited in scope by the availability of 1,4-diketones as synthetic precursors. Current chemical methods have greatly expanded the accessibility of these reagents, and variations of the Paal-Knorr now allow for different precursors to be used. The Paal‚ÄìKnorr was also considered limited by harsh reaction conditions, such as prolonged heating in acid, which may degrade sensitive functionalities in many potential furan precursors. Current methods allow for milder conditions that can avoid heat altogether, including microwave catalyzed cyclizations. Variations Several 1,4-dicarbonyl surrogates can be used in place of a 1,4-dicarbonyl. While these substitutes have different structures from a 1,4-dicarbonyl, their reactions proceed via mechanisms very similar to that of the Paal-Knorr. Œ≤-Epoxy carbonyls Œ≤-Epoxy carbonyls have been known to cyclize to furans. This procedure can use the Œ≤-Œ≥-unsaturated carbonyls as starting materials, which can be epoxidized. The resulting epoxycarbonyl can be cyclized to a furan under acidic or basic conditions. Epoxy carbonyl synthesis 1,4-Diol-2-ynes 1,4-diol-2-yne systems have also been used to do Paal‚ÄìKnorr chemistry. Using palladium, a 1,4-diol-2-yne can be isomerized to the corresponding 1,4-diketone in situ and then dehydrated to the corresponding furan using a dehydration agent. 1,4-diol-2-yne Paal-Knorr The significance of this variation is in the fact that it increases the scope of the Paal‚ÄìKnorr by taking advantage of the wealth of acetylene chemistry that exists, specifically that for the generation of propargyl alcohols. Acetals Acetals have also proven useful starting matierials for the Paal-Knorr. A ketone with an acetal 3 bonds away from it can be converted under exactly the same conditions as a 1,4-diketone to the corresponding heterocycle. Microwave-assisted Paal‚ÄìKnorr Another variation has been the introduction of microwave radiation to enhance the Paal‚ÄìKnorr. Traditional Paal‚ÄìKnorr conditions involved prolonged heating of strong acids to drive dehydration which occurred over a period of several hours. Microwave-assisted Paal‚ÄìKnorr reactions have been demonstrated to occur on time scales measured in minutes and in open flasks at room temperature. Related reactions The Knorr pyrrole synthesis, reported by Knorr in 1884 is the synthesis of a substituted pyrrole from an amino-ketone and a ketone. Also reported by Knorr is a synthesis of pyrazoles from 1,3-dicarbonyls and hydrazines, hydrazides, or semibicarbazides. This synthesis occurs via a condensation mechanism similar to the Paal-Knorr, however if a substituted hydrazine is used, it results in a mixture of regioisomers wherethe substituted heteroatom is either next to the R1 substituent or the R3 substituent. Knorr pyrazole synthesis Synthetic applications In 2000, B. M. Trost et al. reported a formal synthesis of the antibiotic roseophilin. Trost's route to the macrocyclic core of roseophilin, like others, relied on a Paal‚ÄìKnorr Pyrrole synthesis to obtain the fused pyrrole. Heating the 1,4-diketone with ammonium acetate in methanol with camphor sulfonic acid and 4 angstrom molecular sieves gave the pyrrole with no N-substitution. This pyrrole was found to be unstable, and as such was treated with trimethylsilyl ethoxy methoxy chloride (SEM-Cl) to protecte the pyrrole prior to isolation. Roseophillin Paal-Knorr In 1982, H. Hart et al. reported a synthesis of a macrocycle containing fused furan rings using a Paal‚ÄìKnorr furan synthesis. Refluxing para-toluene sulfonic acid in benzene was found to dehydrate the 1,4-diketones to their respective furans to achieve the challenging macrocyclic fused furans.

La G√†rdia and the other main cities of Occitania, in the Occitan language.  Location and language  Guardia Piemontese is located about 55 km northwest of Cosenza on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. Its neighbouring municipalities are Acquappesa, Cetraro, Fuscaldo and Mongrassano. Guardia is an Occitan linguistic enclave.Cf. Hans Peter Kunert, \\"Quale grafia per l‚Äôoccitano di Guardia Piemontese?\\", in: Quaderni del Dipartimento di Linguistica 10, Univ. della Calabria, Serie Linguistica 4, 1993, 27‚Äì36; Kunert, \\"L‚Äôoccitan en Cal√†bria\\", in: Estudis Occitans 16, 1994, 3‚Äì14; Kunert, \\"L‚Äôoccitan en Calabre\\", in: RLR XCVIII, 1994, 477‚Äì489.  History  The date of Guardia's foundation is unknown, and the name of the place has changed several times in history. \\"Guardia\\" means watch or lookout, and this name is probably related to a lookout tower built in the 11th century. Such lookout towers () were built to warn against Arab pirates, then called Saracens, ravaging the coast. Guardia used to be called Guardia Fiscaldi, after the powerful local feudal lords Fiscaldo/Fuscaldo, originating from Fuscaldo. After the settlement of Waldensian refugees who spoke the Occitan language, the place gained the name of Guardia dei Valdi. After their suppression, the name became Guardia Lombarda, which was changed to Guardia Piemontese in 1863. During the 12th and 13th centuries, Waldensians arrived in Calabria fleeing from the Inquisition in the areas of Bobbio Pellice and Torre Pellice, in what is now Piedmont. By 1315, they had settled in Montalto Uffugo, later also in San Sosti dei Valdesi, Vacarizzo and San Vincenzo. The local feudal lords, the Spinelli, being lords of Fuscaldo, granted them refuge. By 1375, they had also settled on the hill rising to 500 metres above sea level on which the upper town of Guardia now stands.Ilona Witten, Kalabrien, 2nd, updated ed., Cologne: DuMont, 22001, p. 58. . For a long period, the Waldensians pretended to live as Roman Catholics, attending the Holy Mass and having their children baptised in Catholic churches. However, privately they stuck to their beliefs and received travelling Waldensian preachers for few days in intervals of about two years. With the successes of the Reformation, many secret Waldensians decided not to hide their true religious beliefs any longer.Ilona Witten, Kalabrien, 2nd, updated ed., Cologne: DuMont, 22001, pp. 58seq. . In 1532, they decided at their Synod of Chanforan (in Piedmont) to confess their beliefs openly. Thereupon, Calabrese Waldensians sent Marco Uscegli as an envoy to Geneva, with the request for preachers to be dispatched. In this way the preacher Gian Luigi Pascale came to Calabria, and he established Waldensian churches in Guardia Piemontese and San Sosti.Ilona Witten, Kalabrien, 2nd, updated ed., Cologne: DuMont, 22001, p. 59. . The Waldensians in their traditional areas in Piedmont did the same, and in 1560 the locally powerful Bishop of Mondov√¨, Cardinal Michele Ghislieri (later to become Pope Pius V), initiated a crusade against the Waldensians.Anacleto Verrecchia, Giordano Bruno: la falena dello spirito, (Rome: Editore Donzelli, 2002, ), p. 43 The Calabrese Roman Catholic Abbot Giovan Antonio Anania informed Ghislieri that the Waldensians in Calabria had meanwhile also adopted preachers of their own, so Ghislieri ordered the abbot to eradicate the Waldensian heresy, in coordination with his local Archbishop of Cosenza, Taddeo Gaddi. First, Anania tried to coerce the Waldensians into converting by way of threats, but they refused. With a sense of foreboding, many Waldensians from neighbouring places fled to Guardia, which was fortified. Guardia's lord Salvatore Spinelli (c. 1506‚Äì1565) tried to make the Waldensians relent and advised Pascale and Uscegli to flee, but in vain. Spinelli, who did not wish to be accused of favouring heretics, finally resorted to a trick. In June 1561, he requested entry to the town for himself and fifty of his men, claiming that they would come unarmed. Loyal to their lord, the men of Guarda let them in. In the night of 4 to 5 June, Spinelli and his henchmen took out their hidden weapons and took the town by force. In doing so, and by further pogroms in the following two weeks, Spinelli and his henchmen murdered about 2,000 Waldensians in Guardia Piemontese and other places. This bloodshed is commemorated by the name of the town's main gate, the Porta del Sangue, or Gate of Blood, because it was said that the blood of the murdered flowed all the way down to it. Next to the town gate there is now the Centro di Cultura Giovan Luigi Pascale which contains a permanent exhibition on the history of the Waldensians of Guardia. The survivors of the massacre had to convert to Roman Catholicism, and marriages between a man and a woman both of Waldensian descent were forbidden. Spioncini, spyholes to be opened from the outside, were to be built into the town's front doors, in order to allow inquisitors to spy into the houses and check whether the compulsory converts really abstain from Waldensian traditions.Ilona Witten, Kalabrien, 2nd, updated ed., Cologne: DuMont, 22001, p. 61. . Some spioncini can still be found in frontdoors. The Waldensian church was demolished. On its site, today's Piazza Chiesa Valdese, a piece of rock from Piedmont has been put in 1975, donated by Guardia's twin city Torre Pellice in memory of the descent of many Guardioti from the Piedmontese rocky Alps.Ilona Witten, Kalabrien, 2nd, updated ed., Cologne: DuMont, 22001, pp. 60seq. . The names of 118 known victims of the 1561 massacre are listed in a plaque at the rock. In memory of the eradication of the Waldensian heresy, Salvatore Spinelli donated the Dominican church Chiesa del SS. Rosario in Guardia. In April 1565 he was created Marchese of Fuscaldo in honour of his deed.Salvatore Spinelli 1¬∞ Marchese di Fuscaldo , retrieved on 8 April 2011.

It is located on a hillside at Great Witcombe, near Gloucester in the English county of Gloucestershire. It has been scheduled as an ancient monument. Background The Roman villa at Great Witcombe is thought to have been built during the first century AD, and was probably occupied until the fifth century AD. These date ranges are largely based upon coins found during excavations of the site.Clifford 1954, p. 25 The villa itself is sited in an unusual location ‚Äì the unevenness of the terrain, which was riddled with small streams and natural springs, would seem to render it unsuitable for such a large dwelling. It is thought, however, that these springs would have been harnessed into water features in stylised gardens, and that a cult of water nymphs may have been cultivated around this, although this is supposition.de la Bedoyere 2002, p. 57 To cope with the difficult terrain, the building itself was constructed on four terraces, cut into the hillside and heavily buttressed, which are still evident on the gallery connecting the two main wings of the house. The architectural design of the villa differs greatly from similar dwellings from the same period, given that the main living quarters were in the large eastern wing, and a long gallery of little function connected this wing with the ‚Äòleisure wing‚Äô where the bath house and temple were located. This layout reflects the evolution of the house over time‚Äîthe bath house wing was a later expansion‚Äîand a consideration of the spatial restrictions of the site. Remains The hypocaust When the site was first excavated in the 19th century it was reported that parts of the villa were very well preserved. Walls of 6 ft high were documented, some still plastered. The bath house was one of the most complete examples known at the time and several mosaic floors were recorded. Poor conservation techniques and heavy rain have destroyed most of these features.Clifford 1954, p. 9 The site currently consists of the remains of low walls which give a good idea of the general shape of the building. Two parts of the bath house are protected by small sheds, not accessible to the public. Besides its unusual shape, the villa has a few features worth noting, including a bath house and latrine, household shrine and an octagonal room of unknown use. Latrine Part of the latrine The latrine is located near the dressing room of the baths. The main drain on the north side was formed of stone and is still evident today. The fittings were removed in the late 4th century, but debris nearby suggests they were originally made of sandstone. The walls were plastered and coloured white with red stripes and patches of pink. The latrine was accessible via a passageway which contained a mosaic floor. Parts of the plaster fragments of one of the walls still remain. Bath house area Detail of mosaic floor The villa contained at least one substantial bath house, in the north-western wing. This included the latrine, which formed an L-shape around a dressing room (apodyterium). The dressing room led to the cold room (frigidarium) which contained a cold plunge bath and whose mosaic floor, decorated with a design of fish and sea creatures, is still well preserved under a modern protective building. This mosaic suggests an individual treatment of the standard sea animal and fish designs that circulated in copy books. The frigidarium had at least one, possibly two, plunge pools ‚Äì one of these is now detached from the building owing to landslides. The apodyterium was also connected via a slype‚Äîa small narrow passageway‚Äîto the warm room or tepidarium. The remains of under- floor hypocausts, which were filled in during the fourth-century, are still evident today. After the period of Roman Britain various changes occurred which may have included the narrowing of the furnace opening. The tepidarium would have led into the hot room, the caldarium, which included two hot baths, one which still contains the remains of a seat. The rooms were heated by a hypocaust ‚Äì the furnace is still visible on the north side. Temple/shrine room The temple room The shrine room was situated in the north-west wing of the villa. Its only access point seems to have been the staircase leading from rooms on a higher terrace. During the early excavations, the walls of this room were found covered with a coat of stucco painted in panels of different colours. Niches in the north wall that probably accommodated statues and a possible altar base have led the archaeologists, lead by Neil Holbrook to suggest that the room had a religious function. In the middle of the room a small cistern can be found, a common addition to Roman temples. The water in the reservoir was supplied via a drainage system. A small statue and several animal bones were found in the drain, suggesting these were used for offerings. Octagonal room The long gallery connects to a large octagonal room in the middle which was constructed in the 4th century. It is not clear what the exact function of this unusual shaped room was, although it is generally considered to be a reception room.Ellis, 1995, p. 176 A religious function has also been suggested, but it is more likely that the room simply formed part of an imposing entrance for the building.Todd, 2005, p. 308 NotesReferences *Clifford, E.M.

It serves the town of Ararat, and opened on 7 April 1875.Ararat Vicsig It is also the junction for the Ararat ‚Äì Maryborough line. Facilities Ararat has two platform faces. The full length standard gauge platform is on the north side with broad gauge trains using a bay platform on the south side. There is a railway grade crossing approximately 500 metres east of the station to allow the broad gauge to continue east towards Beaufort and Ballarat, while the standard gauge heads south towards Geelong. Control of signals is by the Australian Rail Track Corporation control centre at Mile End, South Australia, and Centrol, in Melbourne. A dead end siding is located to the east for stabling broad gauge passenger trains while across from the main platform are two standard gauge loops and one dead end siding.ARTC system maps: Victoria Western Line Australian Rail Track Corporation History The railway first reached Ararat from Ballarat on 7 April 1875. The line south to Portland opened in December 1877, and the mainline was extended west, reaching the South Australian border at Serviceton, in January 1887. The line to Maryborough opened in 1890.The Ararat Story Royal Historical Society of Victoria Two signal boxes ('A' and 'B') opened in 1891, and in 1914, the goods sidings were extended, with the locomotive depot built soon after. In the late 1930s, the locomotive depot was expanded, in conjunction with the arrival of the new H class 4-8-4 steam locomotives, intended for use on The Overland passenger train. An turntable was installed with 24 roads around it, the largest on the Victorian Railways network. Before this time, Stawell was the major servicing facility in the region. During 1985, the passenger facilities in the main station building were refurbished. However, during this time, rationalisation of the facilities began; the \\"B\\" box was demolished in 1984, and the train control office followed in 1988. The former footbridge, which was located at the Up end of the station, was destroyed by a derailment in May 1986. The former Mobil siding and associated points and staff lock were abolished in January 1988. The locomotive depot closed in 1989, with 'A' box following in 1996. Gauge conversion also occurred at the station in the 1990s, with the main line to Adelaide converted to standard gauge, as part of the One Nation project. The lines west and south were converted, with the line to Maryborough converted to dual gauge soon after. The former main line to Ballarat had services suspended in April 1995, and was left as broad gauge. V/Line passenger services westward to Dimboola had earlier been withdrawn on 21 August 1993, with the Ballarat to Ararat service withdrawn on 27 May 1994. On 11 July 2004, the line to Ballarat was reopened, with V/Line passenger services reinstated.Ararat sleepers awake to new sound‚Äîthe train The Age 10 July 2004 The contract for the works was awarded in February 2003, and required a diamond crossing and signalling to be installed, to allow the broad gauge line to reach the platform.

It is an 11th-century late Anglo-Saxon building, completed a decade before the Norman Conquest of England. In the 16th century the chapel ceased to be used for worship and by the 17th century it was part of a farmhouse. It was rediscovered and restored late in the 19th century, and further restored in the 20th century. It is now managed by English Heritage. The chapel is the smaller of two Anglo-Saxon places of worship in Deerhurst. The larger and older is St Mary's Priory Church. Both buildings were part of a Benedictine priory, whose site is now a scheduled monument. History Dedication stone set up by Earl Odda, dated 1056, now at the Ashmolean Museum Earl Odda had the chapel built for the benefit of the soul of his brother √Ülfric, who died on 22 December 1053. Ealdred, Bishop of Worcester consecrated it on 12 April 1056. The building has a nave and chancel, linked by a Romanesque chancel arch. A smaller Romanesque arch forms a doorway on the north side of the chapel. The nave has small windows high in the north and south walls. In the English Reformation in the 1540s Kings Henry VIII and Edward VI abolished chantries. Late in the 16th or early in the 17th century the chapel building was re-used as part of a timber-framed farmhouse, Abbot's Court, which was built against its east wall. The nave was converted into a kitchen. A first floor was inserted in the chancel. Three- and four-light domestic windows were inserted in the north and south walls of the chancel. In time the building's true age and its identity as a chapel were forgotten. In 1675 Sir John Powell, a local landowner, discovered near Deerhurst an 11th-century stone slab inscribed in Latin with the dedication of the chapel. It translates: > \\"Earl Odda ordered this royal hall to be built and dedicated in honour of > the Holy Trinity for the soul of his brother √Ülfric, taken up from this > place. Ealdred was the bishop who dedicated the building on the second day > before Ides of April in the fourteenth year of the reign of Edward, king of > the English\\". \\"Odda's Stone\\" is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Chancel arch seen from the nave Discovery and restoration In 1865 the then Vicar of St Mary's parish church, Deerhurst, Rev. George Butterworth, deduced from a chronicle of Tewkesbury Abbey and from the existence of Odda's Stone that there had been a chantry chapel in Deerhurst. In 1885 during repairs to Abbot's Court a blocked Anglo-Saxon window was discovered hidden behind plaster. In 1960 the Ministry of Works made the chapel a Grade I listed building. In 1965 the chapel was \\"disentangled\\" from Abbot's Court farmhouse and restoration of its roof was begun. Early photographs show that although the main part of the roof is 17th century there was an earlier design of 11th-12th century date which may be part of the original roof. There have been a number of archaeological excavations at Deerhurst since the 1970s. Items from the 1981 excavation led by Philip Rahtz are in Tewkesbury Museum.

Ancy-le-Franc and its parterre, modified to a design en broderie in the 1630s: etching by Israel Silvestre, 1640s Ch√¢teau d'Ancy-le-Franc is a Renaissance-style ch√¢teau of the 16th century located in the town of Ancy-le-Franc in the department of Yonne, in France. History The site was originally occupied by a 12th-century fort, which survived until the end of the sixteenth century . Construction of the existing ch√¢teau began in 1544, at the request of Antoine III de Clermont, brother-in-law of Diane de Poitiers and son of Anne de Husson, countess of Tonnerre. The design of the building is traditionally attributed to the Italian architect Sebastiano Serlio, who had been invited to France by King Francis I. Following Serlio's death in 1554 at Fontainebleau, architect Pierre Lescot, took over the work, respecting the original plans of Serlio. The interior design is the work of Francesco Primaticcio, who was working at Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau at the time. Antoine de Clermont died in 1578 and his grandson Charles-Henri de Clermont, completed the interior. Fully completed, the ch√¢teau was now able to host prestigious guests such as Henry III (brief visit), Henri IV in 1591, Louis XIII in 1631 and Louis XIV in 1674. In 1683, the Clermont-Tonnerre family was forced to sell the land of Ancy-le-Franc and the ch√¢teau to Fran√ßois-Michel Le Tellier, minister of Louis XIV. The following year, Louvois acquired the entire County of Tonnerre, (including the including Ch√¢teau de Maulnes). Following this, he employed well-known landscape architect Andr√© Le N√¥tre for creating pathways and gardens within the grounds. After the French Revolution, the family managed to regain possession of the ch√¢teau. He restored the grounds as well as the interior of the ch√¢teau to its former glory. In 1844, Ancy-le-Franc was sold to Louis Aim√© Gaspard de Clermont- Tonnerre, a descendant of Antoine III of Clermont. It then passed between various hands, including those of the princes of Merode. The ch√¢teau is currently owned by a private company, Soci√©t√© Paris Investir SAS, which undertook its restoration, and recognition as a national historical monument. Description The architecture of the ch√¢teau is the result of a mixture of French and Italian styles, a consequence of compromise between the French owner and Italian architect. The ch√¢teau is built on a rectangular central plan. Four houses form a square and are each flanked by a projecting pavilion walls. This plan is based on plans called \\"pi\\" widely used in France at that time. Serlio separated the two levels by a wide ledge upon which the second level bays. Tuscan columns were used on the main level and Doric columns were used on the second level. On both levels, the bays were framed by pilasters. While there are currently windows within each bay, this was not originally the case. Serlio wanted to create a rhythm alternating between open windows and empty bays. Additional windows filled all the empty bays in the 17th century. For the facade of the interior, Serlio used Corinthian columns on the first level and Composite columns on the second level. Again, he created a rhythm alternating between open windows and niches framed by pilasters. These niches are adorned with an inner shell. Serlio created a triple arcade on the ground floor, reminiscent of the Villa Madama. Serlio was able to comply with the weight requirements of the building and it's steeply pitched roof in a manner similar to the Ch√¢teau de Villandry, using limestone from Burgundy. Inside the ch√¢teau there are murals from drawings of Primaticcio or Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate, as well as coffered ceilings, fine wood carvings, and various colorful ornaments.

He becomes good friends with Edna Birch and Len Reynolds, and in December 2002, he researches Edna's family tree, and inadvertently reveals Edna's grandmother to have been a prostitute. In February 2003, Jarvis reveals to his lifelong dancing partner Freda Darby that he is in love with her, but she rejects him, which upsets him. Jarvis first gets a job at Tate Haulage in 2003 working for Zoe Tate. Working there, he grows close to Sam Dingle, a young member of the notorious Dingle family, and son of Zak Dingle. However, in 2004, Tate Haulage business executive frames Sam for stealing drink from Tate Haulage. Angry at Sam's unfair justice, Jarvis hands in his resignation from Tate Haulage. Jarvis then gets a job at King's Haulage, but dislikes his boss Tom King, who is also the father of Carl King, who assisted Scott Windsor in framing Sam Dingle for the stolen whiskey. In late 2005, Freda Darby returns to the village and offers Jarvis the chance to leave Emmerdale to live with her in Spain. Jarvis accepts, and he and Freda leave Beckindale to start a new life in Spain on 4 December 2005. The last viewers hear of Jarvis and Freda is when they send flowers to the funeral of Jarvis's good friend Len Reynolds in May 2007. The character of Jarvis was introduced by Steve Frost in 2002, and upon his departure, portrayer Richard Moore stated that he felt the character of Jarvis had run his course, and that it was time for him to give it a rest now. Producers have never denied viewers the chance for a return from Jarvis, but Moore has not yet expressed any interest in returning to the show.

It was originally divided in two hamlets: Serra di Leo and Mongrassano. Like many other Albanian-origin settlements the urban structure was based on the gijtonia, in other words, circular streets. Either in 1459 or early in the 16th century, another group of Albanian political refugees came and settled in Mongrassano. On 20 July 1459 the Prince of Bisignano gave the civil jurisdiction of the city to the Bishop of San Marco. In 1642 the Gaetani acquired the territory; in 1688 they sold the property to the Marquesses of Fuscaldo, who held it until the end of the feudal system in 1806. In 1807 Mongrassano became state owned and in 1811 it joined with Serra di Leo. In 1816 it was elevated to the level of a comune, with Serra di Leo as its frazione.  Language and dialect  Officially the inhabitants speak Italian. Traditionally, the dialect is of Albanian origin (Arb√´resh), but is spoken by an increasingly restricted number of inhabitants.

It links Over to Alney Island. Although there was a crossing at Over recorded in the Domesday Book, this famous bridge was built by Thomas Telford between 1825 and 1828, to carry traffic east-west. It was opened in 1830 and remained in use for traffic until 1974. Until the Severn Bridge was built in the 1960s this was the lowest point downstream that the Severn could be crossed by road bridge. The arch spans 150 feet (46 m), and was based on Jean-Rodolphe Perronet's 1774 design for a bridge over the River Seine at Neuilly. It combines both an elliptical profile over most of the soffit with a segmental profile at its faces. This feature is known as a corne de vache. When built, the arch sank by 2 inches when its timber centering was removed, and another 8 inches due to settlement of the arch foundations. Underneath the bridge Today it is a pedestrian-only bridge, and is in the guardianship of Historic England as a Scheduled Ancient Monument reference number 1015873. Road traffic on the A40 crosses the Severn on a new bridge alongside and upstream of it. This is the last road bridge over the Severn before the Severn Crossings, and was the most downstream free crossing until the Severn Bridge and Second Severn Crossing became free in December 2018, although the Severn Bridge already had free access for pedestrians, cyclists and mopeds and, as previously stated, there is no vehicular access to Over Bridge. Connected by Segregated Bicycle Paths around Alney Island, to Highnam and Gloucester.

It is rectangular ahead from the area excised for the Rockhampton railway station which interrupts the boundary on South Street. At the Rockhampton City had a population of 2,442 people. Services Rockhampton City is home to many regional offices of many private companies as well as various government organisations, who use the suburb as a hub for Central Queensland. This includes Rockhampton Regional Council which administer local government services from City Hall in Bolsover Street. Locally based state and federal politicians also have offices located throughout the CBD. The regional bases of the Queensland Police Service, the Queensland Ambulance Service and the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service are all based in Rockhampton City.

East Street The CBD is home to a traditional shopping strip in East Street often informally referred to as \\"The Mall\\" due to the area having previously been a pedestrian mall from 1987 until 2003, known as the City Heart Mall. East Street had always been the traditional retail hub of the city since European settlement, spanning two city blocks and consists of a variety of retail outlets, including food, fashion, shoes, homewares, chemists and banks. The mall underwent a million dollar redevelopment in 2003 as part of the CBD beautification, which included the return of vehicular traffic to the mall. However, with the lack of an anchor tenant and ongoing issues surrounding the availability of parking, the mall has struggled to compete against the larger air-conditioned shopping centres which were built throughout other parts of the city during the 1980s and 1990s, such as Stockland Rockhampton, which house supermarkets, department stores and national retail chains.Moore, Blythe (5 February 2016) More than 50 vacant shops n Rockhampton CBD cause for concern, ABC News.

The civil parish includes the district of Park Farm. Features The Greensand Way, a long distance footpath stretching from Haslemere in Surrey to Hamstreet in Kent, passes through the parish on the final stretch. Ashford Town Football Club's ground, Homelands, is just outside the village. A 20th century primary school in the village has been greatly expanded due to the influx of people moving to the main neighbourhood Park Farm, which has a large supermarket and may eventually have its own rail halt on the Marshlink Line. The village post office is based in the Kingsnorth Village Hall on Church Hill, although the hamlet or neighbourhood of Stubbs Cross retains its shop/post office. The village cluster of Kingsnorth where the parish church of St Michael and All Angels can be found is quite small. History A Roman settlement was discovered at the crossing of two important Roman roads on Westhawk Farm. The centre of the settlement has been preserved unexcavated as an open space, but before building began on the rest of the site, part of a Roman road was uncovered. There was evidence to show that there had been timber buildings at the side of the road, some of which were associated with ironworking. A shrine or temple was also found with a water-hole which contained 74, mostly 2nd-century coins probably left as offerings. Over 250 coins and many other artefacts were discovered on the site together with a Roman cemetery and an Iron Age burial. A site at Park Farm, which is crossed by one of the Roman roads, also yielded Roman pottery fragments, some of which were associated with the regional distribution of salt, probably made on Romney Marsh. A transcript of the Domesday Book of 1086 indicates that there was a settlement at Kingsnorth controlled by the Manor of Wye. One explanation of the name is that it derived from the Old English cyninges snad, detached land belonging to a royal estate. Another suggestion is that the settlement took its name from Jutish people 'Kyn', kin folk, who settled on a wooded hill or 'snode'. Other early variations of the name are Kyngsnode; Kynsnoth, Kyngesnothe and Kingessnode. The RAF and USAAF occupied RAF Kingsnorth, an airfield close to the village, during World War II. Transport Kingsnorth is bisected by the A2070 Ashford to Hamstreet road. And briefly has a dual carriageway within it, as well as along its nearest border with Ashford, which serves as its main approach road. The road network is otherwise almost a wide grid with slight curves. The village is served by regular buses to Ashford.

It opened in 1670, around 100 years before the start of the Industrial Revolution which brought about the \\"golden age\\" for canals in Britain. Parts of the route can be traced on the ground, though only one lock survives intact. It was part of the Welland Navigation in Lincolnshire. First authorised in 1571, during the reign of Elizabeth I, construction did not start until 1664, under powers granted in 1620 and ratified by James I. It ran for from Stamford to Market Deeping and had 12 locks, two of which were on the river section at Deeping St James. No plans of its construction survive, although one of the locks was documented by a visiting water engineer in 1699. It contributed to the wealth of Stamford, allowing barley to be transported to the town for malting. Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal, northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing, and it closed in 1863, soon after the arrival of the Midland Railway in the area. Although Stamford Corporation attempted to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were unable to do so. Its course and some of its structures can still be traced in the landscape. These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level. History alt=The route of the Welland Canal, looking like a medieval hollow road, overhanging with trees The River Welland was one of the earlier on which improvements, in this case to allow navigation to Stamford, were authorised by an act of Parliament. The act was granted in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1571, and the preamble explained how Stamford had prospered as a result of the river, but also stated that mills built between Stamford and Deeping had resulted in it no longer being navigable, as they had diverted the water. Powers were granted to restore the river using either the old channel or the new one, although it is not clear exactly what was meant by this. There is no evidence that any work was carried out under the terms of the act. However, the powers were revived in 1620, when Stamford Corporation was given permission by the Commission of Sewers to build a new artificial cut, which would run from the eastern edge of Stamford near Hudd's Mill, to Market Deeping, where it would rejoin the river. The corporation estimated that it would cost ¬£2,000 to carry out the work, and the act enabled them to charge tolls for its use, set initially at three pence (1.25 p) per lock, which could be charged once the work was completed. The decision was ratified in 1623 by a grant of James I, and the corporation expected to have the work completed by 1627. However, they were unable to find a suitable contractor to carry out the work, and failed to reach agreement on terms with David Cecil in 1636, and two other potential contractors after that. Nothing happened until 1664, when an Alderman from Stamford called Daniel Wigmore took the job. He built the cut and 12 locks, which included the High Lock and the Low Lock on the river at Deeping St James, at a cost of ¬£5,000. In return for his expenditure, he was given the lease of the tolls for the next 80 years, for which he paid a rent of one shilling (five pence). The cut was the longest canal with locks in the country, when it was opened in 1670. Its construction preceded the 'canal age' by around 100 years, making it one of England's earliest post-Roman canals. There are no known contemporary documents describing the design or methods of construction of the canal and nothing about its opening. However, a report from 1632 on alterations to the river noted that 600 men were involved in the work, so presumably there was sufficient labour locally for such tasks. Wigmore probably used handbills at local inns to recruit his workers, since there were no newspapers to carry advertisements. The work would have been done using pickaxes, shovels and wheelbarrows. The excavated ditch was then lined with blue clay to make it watertight. Excavations for a sewer in 1974 and work on a rubbish tip in 1979 revealed the layers of blue clay, and there were clay pits near Stamford, which supported a pottery industry, although their precise location is unknown. The canal enabled goods to reach Stamford from The Wash, which was away, by way of Spalding and Crowland. The lower used the course of the Welland, after which the two river locks and weirs at Deeping St James were encountered. Beyond Market Deeping, the course consisted of an artificial cut with 10 more locks, by which it reached the eastern edge of Stamford, after which it rejoined the river to reach the town wharf. The length of the cut was , although the length of the canal is usually quoted as , to include the improved river sections at both ends. Just below Stamford, the canal crossed the River Gwash on the level. There was a weir on a bypass channel and a sluice on the main river channel, which enabled the river levels to be controlled, so that barges could cross. Operation Trade thrived, for Richard Blome recorded the prosperous Stamford malt trade in 1673, which depended on barley being carried by boat. With the death of Daniel Wigmore, his son-in-law Charles Halford became the owner of the toll rights. In 1695, he was receiving between ¬£400 and ¬£500 per year, most of it derived from the carriage of sea coal. The trade amounted to 3,000 chaldrons that year, and he tried to get the tax on sea coal, which Parliament had approved, reversed. He did not succeed, and failed again in 1706, by which time he stated that the tax had decreased the amount of coal carried to just 500 chaldrons. Besides coal, the canal carried malt and agricultural produce, groceries, timber, slate and stone. Boats used on the canal were small lighters, long by around wide, capable of carrying from seven to fourteen tons, and normally worked in trains of four vessels. Although there are no known records from the time the canal was constructed, the lock at Hudd's Mill was documented by Thomas Surbey in 1699. Surbey was a water engineer, and made notes and drawings when he visited it, during a journey from London to York. The lock chamber was long and wide. The gates were hung on stone piers, but the banks between them were of earth. The gates were conventional 'V' gates, similar to modern ones, which included some sort of paddle, but did not include balance beams. Instead, a chain or rope was attached to the mid-stream edge of the gate and to the bank. While this would have made opening the gates possible, it is not obvious how they were shut. The measurements match those of the surviving structures, with the exception of Briggin's lock, which appears to only be long. There is no visible evidence that it was shortened at some point, nor any obvious reason why it would have been built shorter than all the others. Expansion When the Melton Mowbray Navigation was being planned in 1785, there were discussions of a link to Oakham, which eventually became the Oakham Canal, and onwards to Stamford. The idea of a canal from Stamford to Oakham, due west, was revived in 1809, with plans for a link from Stamford to the Nene at Peterborough, and a connection from near Market Deeping northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain, from where Boston could be reached. A bill for this, together with one for a rival scheme to link Stamford to the Grand Junction Canal, which also included a connection to the South Forty-Foot Drain, were put before Parliament in 1811, but neither met with any success. The idea was raised again in 1815 and 1828, but no further action was taken. Decline With the arrival of the railways, river trade declined. The Midland Railway reached Peterborough in 1846, and opened their line to Melton Mowbray, passing through Stamford, in 1848. Carriage of coal on the canal stopped, as the railways brought cheaper coal from the Midlands. The locks quickly deteriorated, and there were problems with leakage. By April 1863, all traffic had ceased, and Stamford Corporation tried to sell the line at auction, but failed because their ownership of it was disputed. Since its closure, the canal has largely disappeared but some parts are still viewable on maps and on the ground. The foundations of the two river locks are visible in the Deepings. The River Welland is currently only navigable to Crowland but plans for the Fens Waterways Link include a new link from above Crowland to above the Dog in a Doublet sluice on the River Nene. There are currently no plans to restore navigation to Stamford. The Dog in a Doublet sluice near Peterborough was built in 1937; the Nene is tidal below it. Route Stamford Wharf was the upper limit of navigation, and was situated below Town Bridge, which carries the A43 road over the river at Stamford. There were buildings associated with the canal on both sides of the river, including a large warehouse next to the bridge, parts of which date from 1671, and which is Grade II listed. Barges followed the river down past the ruins of St Leonard's Priory, established in 1090 by the Benedictines,Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map to Hudds Mill, where the cut began, on the north side of the mill. Hudds Mill Lock was almost at the start of the cut. The canal flowed initially to the east, but turned to the north east to cross the River Gwash at right angles. It then entered Uffington Park, where the remains of the weir that regulated river levels at the crossing can still be seen. The Gwash now has much less flow than it did when the canal was active, since the construction of the reservoir at Rutland Water further upstream. The earthworks of the canal continue through the park. The route of the canal is just to the north of the river, and a public footpath follows it through Uffington Park until it reaches the Uffington to Barnack road. The adjacent bridge over the River Welland has three arches and dates from the seventeenth century but the canal bridge has been filled in to protect its structure. There were three locks in open countryside on this section before the canal reached Tallington where Tallington Village Lock was located just to the north of St Lawrence Church, parts of which date from the 12th to 15th centuries, with later additions. Remains of bridge piers were uncovered during archaeological excavations carried out in 1998 when a water pipeline running from Tallington to West Deeping was installed. No details of the bridge have survived, but the levels suggest that it was probably a movable bridge. The canal then passed close to Tallington Mill, a water mill dating from around 1700, to reach Horse Holmes Lock. A railway line crossed the tail of the lock, but after the demise of the canal, the line was widened, and the lock is thought to be buried beneath the embankment. The canal then looped around the northern edge of Horse Marsh to reach West Deeping, where there was another lock. There are visible remains of this lock, indicating that it had stone piers at both ends to support the gates, with turf sides between them. It then crossed King Street. An enclosure map dating from 1810 shows that the road crossed the canal by a ford, but that there was also a footbridge to allow pedestrians to cross the canal without getting wet. From West Deeping to Market Deeping, the canal was close to the northern bank of the northern river channel. There were two more locks in open countryside, and another at the western edge of the town, after which the cut rejoined the river. The final two locks were built on the River Welland, Briggins Lock in Deeping St James, and Low Lock to the south-east of the village. ;Points of interest References ;Bibliography  External links * Rivers of Lincolnshire Canals in Lincolnshire Ruins in Lincolnshire Stamford, Lincolnshire Canals opened in 1670 1670 establishments in England ","title":"Stamford Canal"},{"id":"6292474","text":"Zumpano (Calabrian: ) is a town and comune in the province of Cosenza in the Calabria region of southern Italy.

History According to some hypotheses, the town was founded by the Oenotrians, around the fifteenth century BC. In this account, Cerisano would have been known to the Greeks as the Citerium, Citerion. The first surviving written records mentioning Cerisano date back to 1247. In the feudal period, Cerisano was under the jurisdiction of various lordso. Later, under the rule of Louis III of Anjou, there was a brief period of autonomy when Cerisano was owned by the De Matera, followed by the Sanseverino family of Bisignano. The latter transformed Cerisano into a military outpost. In 1489, the comune was entrusted to Royal Captain Gaspare Firrao, from Cosenza, and then to Bernardino de Marinis Gragnano. In 1490, Bernardino Sanseverino regained possession of the town. In 1519, with the death of Bernardino, his son Pierantonio succeeded him to lead the comune. During the French invasion, he tried unsuccessfully to defend the town from the army that marched from Cosenza. Cerisano was then occupied for a short period until the French army was defeated. In 1528, the country was hit by a famine that killed two-thirds of the population. In the second half of the 16th century began the decline of the ruling Sanseverino family. The Sanseverinos sold Cerisano to Don Pietro Gonzales de Mendoza who entrusted its management to his wife Eleonora Sanseverino. In 1572, the ownership of the estate passed to Valerio Telesio, brother of philosopher Bernardino Telesio. In 1567, Valerio was accused of heresy, a crime punishable by the death penalty. However, with the help of Cardinal William Sirleto, he escaped conviction. He was, however, killed on August 10, 1579, in the church of San Giovanni, in Castelfranco (now called Castrolibero). The estate was then inherited by his son Roberto Telesio, who contracted large debts in 1583 and was forced to sell the estate to Horace Sersale, who married Clarice Telesio, sister of Roberto. On the death of Horace in 1594 the estate passed to his son Hannibal, after a formal request to the authority. On November 25, 1613, he obtained the title of Duke of Cerisano. After the Duke's death, the estate passed to his son, also named Hannibal, which then followed to the brothers Giulio and Geronimo Sersale. Geronimo Sersale was named prince and duke of Cerisano in 1657 and married Portia Sanseverino of Calvera. The marriage produced twins Horace and Diego. The family decided that Horace would inherit the estate and titles with the consent of his brother, and that the latter would be entitled to receive a monthly income. During the early 18th century, Cerisano's economic situation had deteriorated. In 1758, Prince Domenico Sersale, another son of Geronimo Sersale, ordered the property entrusted to the notary Lorenzo Zupo, who continued to administer Cerisano even after the death of the Prince. Throughout the late 18th and 19th Cerisano largely remained under the administration of the Zupo family. Main sights The Old Town of Cerisano lies at the foot of the Palazzo Sersale, with the town square in front, including an acropolis that dominates the village. Churches in Cerisano include San Lorenzo, martyr St. Ugolino of San Domenico, the Carmine, Santa Maria degli Angeli, the convent the Reformed (Oasi S. Antonio), the Madonna of Schiucchi, and St. John the Baptist. Other sights are the Sersale Palace, Palazzo Zupi, Greek Casino, War Memorials, and Villa Zupi. Events In late August and early September, Cerisano holds the Festival of Serre. During the festival, various sections of the town are dedicated to cinema, jazz, theater, classical music, visual arts, and cultural events. People *Frank P.

Among the other products one can find the Calabrese Bomba made from as dried strings of chili peppers which have been infused into olive oil and mixed with other vegetables and mushrooms. The festival is a major event for the small town as it attracts a large number of tourists from all over the world. It lasts for a full week and each day there are several events including famous plays performances, folk dances, speeches by important figures, chili eating challenges and cartoon drawing challenge. Every year they organise special events, such as the exposition of samples of chili peppers from all around the world or research papers about chili peppers published by the local Universit√† del Gusto. Furthermore, there are a lot of stalls set up along the seafront which sell creamed chili sauces, flavoured chocolates (chili, lemon, citron, orange, etc. flavourings), chili flavoured cheese, pottery, Sicilian and , Neapolitan , mixtures of vegetable sauces and creams (including garlic and onion spreadables). Moreover, most of the roads into the town are very narrow and inaccessible with a car, countless little shops of handmade food and handcrafted goods can be found in these roads.  Other attractions  A peculiar characteristic of Diamante are its Mural. Many of these can be found on the outside walls of houses and several of them are centuries old, dating back to the Renaissance. Because of its position Diamante was ravaged by Saracens several times during history. Some of these invasions are documented by the wall paintings.  Geography  The local population is low as it is mainly a touristic place. Due to the expansion of Hotels and Resorts, the sea has gradually become more and more polluted each year. It is not uncommon to see plastic bags or oil floating over the water. However, recent efforts to clean the area seem to have improved the situation. At the moment, many seafishes inhabit the area, including jellyfishes. Not too far from the coast there is the small island of Cirella, formerly a fort against pirats. Every year Diamante experiences severe weather conditions, with seldom sighting of tornadoes either offshore or on the beach. These cause huge damage to the buildings, in particular to the summer houses built right onto the beach. The harbour and seafront have also been destroyed several times. Due to its latitude temperatures can vary wildly, especially in the summer when there is a large night-day difference. There is a train station situated in Diamante, which is linked to major cities like Naples and Messina.

The castle is noted for its huge Edwardian gatehouse that guards the entrance. St Briavels Castle was originally built between 1075 and 1129 as a royal administrative centre for the Forest of Dean. During the 13th century the castle became first a favourite hunting lodge of King John, and then the primary centre in England for the manufacture of quarrels, large numbers of which were required for crossbows in medieval warfare. The castle was transferred many times between royal favourites in the 14th and 15th centuries and slowly declined in appearance and importance. St Briavels Castle became used primarily as a court and as a notorious debtors' prison, conditions being documented by the prison reformer John Howard in 1775. Following local riots and a parliamentary investigation in the 1830s, reforms in the 19th century brought an end to the castle's use as a prison. Extensive renovation at the turn of the 20th century allowed St Briavels Castle to be taken over as a Youth Hostel in 1948. It remains in this role today, owned by English Heritage and open to the public. The castle is classed as a Grade I listed building and as a Scheduled Monument. Architecture St Briavels Castle is located on a spur dominating a position above the River Wye, on the western edge of the Forest of Dean.Remfry, p. 1. The castle is predominantly built of local old red sandstone and limestone.Curnow and Johnson, p. 91. The castle site is surrounded by an in-filled moat; now a garden, the moat was originally wet and fed by a spring underneath the moat itself.Urban, p. 503. A diagram of St Briavels Castle in the early 14th century. Key: A: gatehouse; B: King's chambers and chapel; C: keep; D: hall range; E: the Peel; F: tower; G: moat.After Remfry, p.8. The castle keep, which collapsed and was demolished in the 18th century, was originally a square Norman design, 15.6 m by 13.9 m (51 ft by 45 ft) in size, built on a motte of clay and stone.Verey, p. 333; Curnow and Johnson, p. 92. Intact, it would have been approximately 20 m (66 ft) tall, and would have resembled the keeps at Goodrich Castle and White Castle, both of a similar period and design in the region.Curnow and Johnson, p. 93. The keep was protected by the stone curtain wall that still survives today, forming the castle bailey.Curnow and Johnson, p. 94. Its irregular polygonal plan suggests that it was built on the site of an earlier earthwork. It originally had a small round tower protecting the south-east corner and probably a gateway in the south wall alongside the keep. Other demolished buildings included a forge and assorted buildings along the north-east of the bailey. A set of medieval domestic buildings still stand along the north-west side of the bailey, however, including a hall, solar and chapel, originally providing accommodation for the castle constable and the King.Curnow and Johnson, p. 95. These buildings were restored in the 19th century to their current condition. Some features, including the hall range, fireplace and capitals appear to date from the 13th century. The hall and solar form a two-storey building 23 m by 10 m (75 ft by 33 ft) wide, alongside the 14th century chapel, which still incorporates later 17th century adjustments and windows.Curnow and Johnson, pp. 96, 98. At one end of the domestic range is the famous \\"Forester's Horn\\" chimney, crested with the forest warden's horn, a symbol of Forest Law and the castle's authority.Urban, p. 503; Curnow and Johson, p. 97. The buildings include a sunken pit prison; graffiti dated 1671 show that it was still in use for that purpose at that time.Pettifer, p. 80; Verey, p. 333. The Edwardian castle gatehouse. The gatehouse of St Briavels Castle is described in Pevsner's Buildings of England as \\"magnificent... a very fine example of the royal masons' work of the period.\\"Verey, p. 332. It is a massive structure of two large D-shaped towers flanking a wide gate passage 14.8 m (48 ft) long, and linked above by a large room.Curnow and Johnson, p. 99; Verey, p. 332. This sort of gatehouse is sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse or gatehouse-keep because of the massive size and defences on both the inner and outer sides of the building.King, p. 119; Curnow and Johnson, p. 99; Verey, p. 332. The first gatehouse of this sort was built at Caerphilly Castle; other examples exist in North Wales and at Tonbridge Castle.King, p. 119. Uniquely, St Briavels' gatehouse is protected with three sets of portcullisesalthough some gatehouses, such as Harlech and Beaumaris Castle were built for slots for three, they were only installed with two. A notable feature is the existence of smaller portcullises to defend the doorways from the passage to the porters' lodges. The gatehouse was originally taller than it is today and the entrance would also have included a drawbridge, removed during the 20th century. The base of the gatehouse is defended from undermining by large \\"spurs\\". This design feature is characteristic of castles in the Welsh Marches, including Goodrich and Tonbridge Castle, but unlike these castles depends on a solid octagonal, rather than square, based interacting with the form of the circular towers.Curnow and Johnson, p.99; Pettifer, pp. 96‚Äì7; Thompson, p. 114. The gatehouse is well defended, except for the upper windows at the rear; the upper floors were designed for high status guests and these windows would have provided adequate light for the chambers. The south-east of the gatehouse is relatively modern, however, having been rebuilt after a past collapse.Curnow and Johnson, p. 100. History=11th and 12th centuries The octagonal \\"spurs\\" designed to prevent undermining. St Briavels Castle appears to date from Norman times, although the village itself predates the Norman period. The area was acquired by William FitzOsbern, the first Earl of Hereford in 1067, who built a number of castles across the region, including Chepstow, Monmouth, Clifford and Wigmore. It does not appear that FitzOsbern built a castle on the St Briavels site, however, and the revolt of FitzOsbern's son, Roger de Breteuil resulted in the village being taken into the possession of the royal bailiffs of the Forest of Dean. St Briavels Castle was constructed sometime between 1075 and 1129 by royal mandate, although the precise date is uncertain.Remfry, p. 2. Walter de Gloucester, the Sheriff of Gloucester and his son Miles de Gloucester made St Briavels Castle the administrative centre of the Forest of Dean. The location of the castle placed it well behind the English border, in an area with little Welsh presence before the invasion, and it therefore appears to have been established for the purposes of royal governance, rather than to protect the Welsh Marches to its west. Equivalents elsewhere in the south-west include Restormel Castle and Lydford Castle in Devon and Cornwall, both regional royal administrative centres.Curnow and Johnson, p. 92. One alternative view, however, sees St Briavels as intended to protect the Severn estuary to the south, along with the royal castles of Bristol and Gloucester.Emery, p. 15. This early castle was of motte and bailey design, the keep probably of wood. The famous \\"Forest Horn\\" chimney of St Briavels Castle. Miles and his partner Pain fitzJohn strengthened their hold on the Welsh border during the last years of Henry I, but after the king's death in 1135 England descended into the civil war of the Anarchy, as factions loyal to King Stephen and the Empress Matilda fought for control of the country. Fitz John was killed early in the fighting, but Miles declared in favour of Matilda and took control of the castle in his own right. In 1141 the Empress confirmed Miles as the Earl of Hereford and formally granted him St Briavels Castle. Under Miles, the castle escaped the worst of the fighting of the Anarchy. Miles' son, Roger Fitzmiles continued to hold the castle into the reign of Henry II, the empress' son, but a confrontation with the king resulted in it being removed from the earldom and taken back into royal ownership, once again as part of the Forest of Dean. Henry II rebuilt the castle keep in the 1160s, replacing the older wooden structure with stone. Royal forests in the early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction; forest law was \\"harsh and arbitrary, a matter purely for the King's will\\".Huscroft, p.97. Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds, raw materials, goods and money. The Forest of Dean could be used for hunting, but was more important to the king as a major metalworking centre, thanks to the plentiful supply of trees for making charcoal and the iron deposits in the limestone stone of the region.Curnow and Johnson, p.92; Pounds, p. 200. The iron goods constructed locally were stored at the castle before being shipped to other royal locations. The quantities being produced were substantialin 1172, for example, Henry II received 100 axes, 1,000 picks, 2,000 shovels and 60,000 nails from St Briavel Castle. Richard I took 50,000 horseshoes on crusade with him from St Briavel. The constable of St Briavel Castle had wide-ranging responsibilities within the Forest, including managing the rights and privileges of the iron-workers, exercised through the Miners' and the Hundreds Court of the castle.Curnow and Johnson, p. 91; Rudge, p. 22. 13th century The inner face of St Briavels Castle gatehouse. King John enjoyed regular hunting in the Forest each November, and used St Briavels Castle as his base for such trips. The king entertained the Welsh lord Gruffyd ap Cadwallon at the castle in 1207.Remfry, p. 3; Curnow and Johnson, p.96. This royal interest resulted in further building works and substantial expenditure, with ¬£291 being spent in the next four years. A stone curtain wall replaced an earlier wooden one between 1209‚Äì11, complete with a tower and gateway. Inside the bailey a number of buildings suitable for use by the king as a lodge were constructed. A wooden chapel was built within the castle in 1236‚Äì7.Curnow and Johnson, p. 98. The castle expansion may have been funded by the increased taxes from iron-working across the areas, and by the end of John's reign, the castle was almost in its mature form.Nicholls 1858, p. 11; Remfry, p. 3. In 1217 the Charter of the Forest was passed, in part to mitigate the worst excesses of royal jurisdiction.Huscroft, p. 173. The forest laws, however, did allow for a very wide range of fines to be imposed on local peasants who broke the numerous edicts in place to protect both wildlife and the trees in the forest.Birrell, p. 149. The courts held at St Briavels Castle imposed a relatively large number of fines, or amercements, for both illegal wood-cutting and the poaching of venison during the period.Birrell, p. 154. The castle also began to be used a prison shortly afterwards, partially for forest trespassers and for those who could not pay the required fines.Pugh, p. 79. After King John's death, however, St Briavels Castle became the primary centre for English quarrel manufacture. The crossbow was an important military advance on the older short bow and was the favoured weapon by the time of Richard Imany crossbows and even more quarrels were needed to supply royal forces.Pounds, p. 108. Crossbows were primarily built at the Tower of London, but St Briavels Castle, with the local forest to provide raw materials, became the national centre for quarrel manufacture.Pounds, p. 110. The gatehouse passageway, uniquely defended with three portcullises. In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher arrived at the castle and began production operations at a forge built within the bailey.Remfry, p. 3; Curnow and Johnson, p. 95. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100 quarrels a day.Curnow and Johnson, p. 91; Pounds, p. 109; Remfry, p. 3. Quarrels were then put into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities.Pounds, p. 109. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh being one of the levers of royal power during the period.Pounds, p. 146. Now a centre for arms manufacture, the castle was made more secure, with a new defensive ditch, freshly repaired walls and a new chapel. The castle was garrisoned with royal troops during the uprising of Richard Marshal against Henry III in 1233‚Äì4, suggesting it had considerable military value at this time.Remfry, p. 4. Another indicator of the military importance of the castle and the surrounding forest was the ¬£20 fee each year being paid to the constable of the castle by 1287, on a par with the much larger castles of Rhuddlan or Nottingham.Pounds, p. 88. Under Edward I, the massive gatehouse was built to protect the castle entrance, including special protection against undermining.Pettifer, p. 80. There has been speculation that the royal architect James of Saint George may have been responsible for the building work, which occurred between 1292‚Äì3 at a cost of ¬£477.Curnow and Johnson, p. 99, 103. The reason for the king extending the castle at this time is unclear, as the castle was relatively far from the Welsh border and in no particular risk of attack.Curnow and Johnson, p. 103. One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time, the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation. In 1300, the old wooden chapel was rebuilt in stone and in 1310, an extension to the castle wall was constructed at a cost of ¬£40; called 'the Peel', this followed the line of the old motte and gave additional protection to the keep.Curnow and Johnson, p. 94, 98. 14th‚Äì17th centuries St Briavel's Castle chapel, redesigned in the 17th century St Briavels Castle remained an important location in the reign of Edward II, as the Welsh Marches were a key region in the wars between the king, his favourites and various noble factions during the period.Weir, p. 129. Roger d'Amory was the constable of the castle during the early years of Edward's reign. D'Amory was a royal favourite and Edward II visited the Castle several times, with an extensive renovation of the rooms and quarters occurring during this time.Curnow and Johnson, p. 99. Around ¬£500 was spent on the work, a substantial sum. D'Amory was supplanted in the king's favour by Hugh Despenser the Younger, and d'Amory fought against the king in the Despenser War of 1321-22. After the war, Edward placed the Marches under the control of the Despensers, with Hugh Despenser the Elder taking particular responsibility for St Briavels.MacKenzie, p. 323; Vickers, p. 117. The Despensers appointed Robert Sapy as the keeper of St Briavels and the other confiscated castles across the Marches.Fryde, p. 176. Violence began to break out across the region in response to the Despenser's harsh rule, and Sapy's deputy was attacked in July 1325 on his way back from St Briavels Castle to London; his eyes were torn out, his arms and legs broken and all his records and money stolen. Edward and the Despensers were deposed shortly afterwards by Edward's wife, Isabella of France.Weir, p. 255. Isabella set about expanding her own lands after her victory, and took St Briavels Castle and various other royal castles into her own possession.Weir, p. 257. When Isabella herself was overthrown by her son, Edward III, in 1330 the castle then reverted to the crown. Towards the end of the 14th century, England saw increasing conflict between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions. St Briavels Castle passed back and forth between the senior nobility on either side, but without playing a major part in the conflict itself. The castle was initially given to King Edward's son Thomas, Duke of Gloucester; with the fall of Thomas from favour after his uprising against Richard II, Thomas le Despenser received a life grant of the castle in 1397, as part of his reward for serving Richard.Dunn, p. 59. With Thomas' own fall from power under Henry IV, the castle was then given to Henry's son, the Duke of Bedford.MacKenzie, p. 323. Henry Beauchamp, the Duke of Warwick and a close friend of Henry IV, then acquired St Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean around 1445.Hicks, p. 31. William Herbert was rewarded with the castle in 1467 for his support for Edward IV and the Yorkist faction during the Wars of the Roses; he was then executed by the Lancastrian Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who took the castle for his own.Nicholls, 1863, p. 14. Warwick died himself at the Battle of Barnet in 1471, but after being briefly held by Robert Hyet, Henry VII restored St Briavels Castle to Neville's widow, Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick. With Anne's death in 1492, the castle passed into the control of Thomas Baynham. St Briavels Castle in 1823 By this time, however, St Briavels Castle had been in a slow period of decline for many years, similar to that of several other royal castles in the region, including Bristol and Gloucester. Minor improvements were made, including various light windows added to the internal buildings in the 15th century,Curnow and Johnson, p. 96. and extensive restyling of the chapel in the 17th century, but not to the extent of those castles successfully converted to more luxurious dwellings. Under James I and Charles the castle was traditionally granted to the Earls of Pembroke.Nicholls, 1863, p. 16. By the time of the English Civil War, St Briavels Castle was held by Philip Herbert, the 4th earl and a friend of the king's. Philip Herbert sided with Parliament, however, and St Briavels' played little part in the conflict. With the Restoration and the return of Charles II to power in 1660, the castle was removed from the Earls of Pembroke and given instead to Henry, Lord Herbert of Raglan for life. After Henry's death, Duke of Beaufort was granted the property; after the disgrace of the Duke of Beaufort a few years later, the castle changed hands again, with the subsequent owners being more modest figures in English public life than had been the case in previous years. 18th and 19th centuries The courtroom at St Briavels Castle in early Victorian times. In the 18th century many of the buildings inside the bailey were knocked down and the more valuable materials, including the lead from the roof, recycled. The keep partially collapsed in 1752, with the remainder falling down in 1777.Brayley and Tombleson, \\"St. Briavel's Castle\\"; Storer, p. 2; National Monuments Record, accessed 13 August 2010. Victorian writers blamed both the progress of time and the theft of stones by local peasants for the collapse.Thomas, p. 59. The famous \\"forester's horn\\" chimney was moved from its original location to the west side of the building between 1783 and 1824.Curnow and Johnson, p.97. Whilst not achieving the picturesque status of other ruined castes in the area, Georgian visitors noted the \\"beautiful and romantic scenery that surrounds these ruins\\".Storer, p. 2. The castle was now principally a prison and a court, still operating under the authority of the constable and the Forest Law originally established in 1217.King, p. 5; Curnow and Johnson, p. 95. The remaining buildings inside the bailey were converted into a courtroom and jury room, with the west side of the gatehouse being used as a jail for detaining prisoners. St Briavels Castle was primarily a debtors' prison ‚Äì in England up until the Debtors' Act of 1869, individuals unable to pay their debts or fines could be detained in prison indefinitely to encourage payment. The conditions in the castle prison became increasingly notorious after a visit from the prison reformer John Howard in 1775 as part of his research for the first edition of his book The State of the Prisons, published two years later. Howard found the prison \\"greatly out of repair\\", with the two inmates locked in a single room without exercise for the best of a year, with no fresh water, financial support or firewood.Brown, p. 182. Graffiti on the stone walls of the castle jail includes the mournful inscription by a prisoner of the period \\"For I have been here a great space; And I am weary of the place.\\"King, p. 5. In 1831 there were extensive riots in the Forest of Dean, led by Warren James.Nicholls 1858, p. 122. After the intervention of the military, the rioters were dispersed and order restored, but a range of complaints were levied about the enforcement of the local laws on miners and metal-workers.Nicholls 1858, p. 112. There had been attacks against St Briavels Castle by discontented locals before during the 1780s, but the degree of violence in this case was much greater.Fisher, 13. An act of Parliament followed, establishing a number of commissioners who investigated local practices and recent events at the Castle. The notorious debtors' prison at St Briavels Castle in early Victorian times. The debtors' prison at the castle came in for particular scrutiny. It emerged that out of the 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of ¬£5 or less (¬£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes.Nicholls 1858, p. 113. A penalty of up to ¬£7 (¬£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week for the use of the beds in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on friends or relatives for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.House of Lords, p. 40; Society for the Improvement of Prison Discipline, p. 175. The castle prison was found to still be in a very bad condition. The commissioners noted how the prison had \\"only one window, which is one foot wide and in a recess. It does not open.... There is a door at the outer end of the passage, and in it a hole which is considered necessary for air... The privy is a dark winding recess...

The original name of the town was Montalto. Uffugo was added to the town's name after the unification period in the 1860s. It was the childhood home of composer Ruggero Leoncavallo. His opera Pagliacci takes place in Montalto. Frazioni=Vaccarizzo Vaccarizzo Vaccarizzo is a hamlet of Montalto Uffugo, located a few kilometers away in west direction. It is possible to get there by taking the SP31 provincial road, immediately after passing through the hamlet of Parantoro. After leaving Vaccarizzo, the SP31 continues north towards the Arbereshe municipality of San Benedetto Ullano, with which it acts as a \\"limes\\" the Argentino river, called by the locals \\"arzintina\\". Vaccarizzo is situated at the foot of the Pauline coastal chain, which has the highest point on the Monte Cozzo Cervello summit, which reaches an altitude of 1389 m and it can be identified at a distance due to the large telecommunications antennas located on the ridge. On top of the summit there is also a statue of St. Francis of Paola that the faithful venerate every year on May 1st on a pilgrimage on foot to Paola. These mountains are part of the protected area \\"Natural Park of the Media Valle Crati Community\\". The main square of Vaccarizzo is named after Giuseppe Garibaldi, the \\"Hero of the Two Worlds\\". In the upper part of the town, called \\"timbuni\\", there is a sports field and a statue of Padre Pio. The village has a primary school and a post office. There are two churches. The first of the Visitation of Mary dates back to the 1600s. The population celebrates it on the third Sunday of September with a procession through the whole village, followed by a musical band, fireworks. The second is the San Rocco¬¥s church, erected by the Waldensians around the 13th century. It is celebrated on the first Sunday after the 15th of August. The population of Vaccarizzo is also very devoted to the \\"Madonna della Serra\\", patron saint of Montalto Uffugo. Legend has it that one day the statue of the Madonna della Serra was found rotated with respect to its original position and facing Vaccarizzo. Reported in its original position, the next day it was found once again turned towards Vaccarizzo, so that at the third time it was clear that it was a divine sign. The Madonna was thus left facing Vaccarizzo and the church entrance changed. The statue of the Madonna della Serra is carved in a single piece of oak wood and is represented seated in majesty on a throne holding the Child. The population of Vaccarizzo pays tribute to the Madonna della Serra with a pilgrimage on foot in February to thank her for the narrow escape of the earthquake of 1981. The inhabitants of Vaccarizzo are called \\"vaccarizzari\\". The traditional games are the competition with ball bearing carts and the \\"pazzotta\\" competition, which consists in throwing a form of pecorino cheese triggered by a wounded wire, along the streets of the village, making it travel bold curves and hard trajectories. Among the trades of the ancient craft tradition of Vaccarizzo is the wicker interleaver or master basket maker, called \\"u spurtunaru\\". That is to say the one who created baskets of different sizes and shapes from the interweaving of willow or chestnut branches or canes, called \\"panari\\", \\"spurtuni\\", \\"cannizzi\\", which were used for transporting vegetables and fruit. At Vaccarizzo silk processing and spinning was practiced, behind the church Visitazione di Maria Santissima, the remains of an ancient spinning mill, called \\"filanna\\", are visible. The breeding of silkworms, in the past, was entrusted to women who often allocated them in the chest for better protection An ancient rite of the Vaccarizzo tradition is the slaughter of the pig. In an economy of subsistence, pig breeding was considered an indispensable element for the survival of the family. The killing of the pig took place in a very picturesque context, where everyone had a role, which from year to year remained fixed. There were those who \\"scannava\\" the animal, those who depilated their leather with boiling water, those who dissected it and separated their meat for the various finished products: soppressata, sausage, capicollo, ham, guanciale called \\"bujiio\\". Other rituals linked to the tradition were the tomato sauce, called \\"a cunserva\\", the harvest and relative production of wine, the olive harvest and relative production of oil at the local mill called \\"trappito\\" , the collection of figs, chestnuts. In March 2019, Vaccarizzo joined the list of \\"adopted\\" countries from MIT in Boston (USA), in order to counteract depopulation. Sports S.S.

Standards  SISWG oversees work on the following standards: The base IEEE 1619 Standard Architecture for Encrypted Shared Storage Media uses the XTS-Advanced Encryption Standard (XEX-based Tweaked CodeBook mode (TCB) with ciphertext stealing (CTS); the proper name should be XTC (XEX TCB CTS), but that acronym is already used to denote the drug ecstasy. The P1619.1 Authenticated Encryption with Length Expansion for Storage Devices uses the following algorithms: * Counter mode with CBC-MAC (CCM) * Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) * Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) with HMAC- Secure Hash Algorithm * XTS-HMAC-Secure Hash Algorithm The P1619.2 Standard for Wide-Block Encryption for Shared Storage Media has proposed algorithms including: * XCB * EME2 The P1619.3 Standard for Key Management Infrastructure for Cryptographic Protection of Stored Data defines a system for managing encryption data at rest security objects which includes architecture, namespaces, operations, messaging and transport. P1619 also standardized the key backup in the XML format. Narrow-block vs. wide-block encryption An encryption algorithm used for data storage has to support independent encryption and decryption of portions of data. So-called narrow-block algorithms operate on relatively small portions of data, while the wide-block algorithms encrypt or decrypt a whole sector. Narrow-block algorithms have the advantage of more efficient hardware implementation. On the other hand, smaller block size provides finer granularity for data modification attacks. There is no standardized \\"acceptable granularity\\"; however, for example, the possibility of data modification with the granularity of one bit (bit-flipping attack) is generally considered unacceptable. For these reasons, the working group selected the narrow-block (128 bits) encryption with no authentication in the standard P1619, assuming that the added efficiency warrants the additional risk. But recognizing that wide-block encryption might be useful in some cases, another project P1619.2 has been started to study the usage of wide-block encryption. The project is maintained by the IEEE Security in Storage Working Group (SISWG). Both the disk storage standard P1619 (sometimes called P1619.0) and the tape storage standard P1619.1 were standardized in December 2007. A discussion was ongoing on standardization of the wide-block encryption for disk drives, like CMC and EME as P1619.2, and on key management as P1619.3. LRW issue From 2004 to 2006, drafts of the P1619 standards used the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in LRW mode. In the 30 Aug 2006 meeting of the SISWG, a straw poll showed that most members would not approve P1619 as it was. Consequently, LRW-AES has been replaced by the XEX-AES tweakable block cipher in P1619.0 Draft 7 (and renamed to XTS-AES in Draft 11). Some members of the group found it non-trivial to abandon LRW, because it had been available for public peer-review for many years (unlike most of the newly suggested variants). The issues of LRW were: # An attacker can derive the LRW tweak key K2 from the ciphertext if the plaintext contains K20n or 0nK2. Here  is the concatenation operator and 0n is a zero block. This may be an issue for software that encrypts the partition of an operating system under which this encryption software is running (at the same time). The operating system could write the LRW tweak key to an encrypted swap/hibernation file. # If the tweak key K2 is known, LRW does not offer indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA) anymore, and the same input block permutation attacks of ECB mode are possible. Leak of the tweak key does not affect the confidentiality of the plaintext.

History Longobucco's name derives from the Latina longa bucca (\\"large mouth\\"), referring to the original Greek name of the nearby torrent Macrocioli; in the past it was associated with Temesa, or Tempsa, the ancient town Homer was referring to in his Odyssey and famous for its mining fields, from which the Sybarites derived silver to coin their coins, as well as Kroton and the Romans. The first documents about the Argentera date to the 12th century. In 1197 Emperor Henry VI sent to oppido nostro Longoburgi (our town Longburg) his relative Pietro di Livonia to supervise the precious mineral extraction. Even Gioacchino da Fiore went there for the manufacturing of some goblets. In the 16th century ‚Äòthe Argentera‚Äò was the most important mine in the area, where people continued working until 1783. Between 1806 and 1808 Longobucco was thrice invaded by the French. From 1861 on, the town was involved in the phenomenon of Brigantaggio, which was hardly repressed. It turned into the land of famous bandit-chiefs, among whom was Domenico Strafaci known as Palma. Emigration to the United States and Argentina reached its peak at this time as Longobucchesi such as the Gammuto family sought to escape poverty and the brigantaggio to find opportunity in the new world. Longobucco was the birthplace of famous American gangsters such as Frankie Yale. At the beginning of the 19th century, the first power stations started working. After World War II the Longobucchesi took part in a massive working-class and farm-labourers rebellion. In the 1950s a reforestation process was started by reclaiming areas, as well as in the 1960s and the 1970s many services too.

Beds are the layers of sedimentary rocks that are distinctly different from overlying and underlying subsequent beds of different sedimentary rocks. Layers of beds are called strata. They are formed from sedimentary rocks being deposited on the Earth's solid surface over a long periods of time. The strata are layered in the same order that they were deposited, permitting discrimination as to which beds are younger and which ones are older (the Law of Superposition). The structure of a bed is determined by its bedding plane. Beds can be differentiated in various ways, including rock or mineral type and particle size. The term is generally applied to sedimentary strata, but may also be used for volcanic flows or ash layers. Types of beds include cross beds and graded beds. Cross beds are not layered horizontally and are formed by a combination of local deposition on the inclined surfaces of ripples or dunes, and local erosion. Graded beds shows a gradual change in grain or clast sizes from one side of the bed to the other. A normal grading occurs where there are larger grain sizes on the older side, while an inverse grading is where there are smaller grain sizes on the older side. By knowing the type of beds, geologists can determine the relative ages of the rocks. Bed thickness Thickness of bed and laminae sizes in centimeters A bed is the smallest lithostratigraphic unit, usually ranging in thickness from a centimeter to several meters and distinguishable from beds above and below it. The thickness of the bed is determined by the time period involving the deposition of the rocks. * Very Thick Bed - 100cm * Thick Bed - 30cm * Medium Bed - 10cm * Thin Bed - 3cm * Very Thin Bed - 1cm * Thinner than 1cm is called a Lamina Engineering considerations In geotechnical engineering a bedding plane often forms a discontinuity that may have a large influence on the mechanical behaviour (strength, deformation, etc.) of soil and rock masses in, for example, tunnel, foundation, or slope construction.  Geologic principles  Law of Superposition, Law of Original Horizontality, Law of Lateral Continuity, Cross-Cutting Relationship There are geologic principles that the beds normally follow. Even though there can be cases where the principles do not apply mostly due to faults, they are true for most cases. * Law of Superposition is the law that states that the oldest rocks are deposited first and has the younger layers deposited last, as long as the beds have not been overturned through tectonic activities. This is used to date the stratigraphy and their relative ages. * Law of Original Horizontality states that if the beds are not horizontal, then the layers were caused to either fold or tilt through tectonic activities. They were all deposited horizontally due to gravity. * Law of Lateral Continuity states that the bed deposits extends in all lateral directions. This implies that if two places separated by erosional features have similar rocks, it could mean that they were originally continuous. * Cross-Cutting Relationship states that a fault is younger than the rock layers that it goes through. It helps with relatively dating the rocks. See also * Geological unit * Lamination (geology) * Stratigraphy * Stratum References * Lamina, Laminaset, Bed and Bedset. Campbell, Charles V.

Lauris has graduated from Jelgava Music college, studied, although never graduated, communication studies at the University of Latvia and trained as an actor in Los Angeles, California. He has released eight solo albums and singles in 11 languages. As a composer and recording artist Lauris Reiniks has received more than 20 National Latvian awards and has gained international recognition in the Baltic states. Lauris Reiniks is also the Season 1 winner of Latvian \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" show. The millions of views of his music videos on YouTube has unofficially made him a \\"King of YouTube\\" in Latvia.  Early years  Lauris was born in small Latvian town ‚Äì Dobele, grew up in a musical family in Tƒìrvete. Lauris' first appearance on television was at the age of 5, singing in a show called Neighbors Meet. As a kid and teenager, Lauris was a soloist in a pop-rock group called \\"AURI\\" formed by his father. Together with this band Lauris gained his first stage experience; participating in different children music festivals, contests and other musical activities. The Reiniks family (mother Dace, father Arturs, sister Ruta) used to be one of the most active singing families in the country. They regularly appeared on a broadcast called \\"Spiets\\" (The Swarm) and toured around Latvia with concerts. In 1988, Latvian Television noticed Lauris and offered him to host a new musical TV show called \\"No≈°u Spƒìles\\" (Games of Music Notes). The show brought Lauris together with the top popular Latvian composer Raimonds Pauls who invited Lauris to participate in several his music projects and record songs. This collaboration lasted for one year when Lauris realized he could write his own music and be an independent artist. The management company \\"Aktiv Music\\" approached Lauris Reiniks in 2000 and offered him a record deal with Platforma Records company. That was a moment when Lauris stepped into the \\"big\\" scene of Latvian pop music and started his way to fame.  Music career highlights  Lauris Reiniks' most popular and renowned songs in Latvia are \\"Sirds Sadeg Neparasti\\", \\"Es Neesmu NeprƒÅtƒ´gs\\", \\"Tik Balti\\", \\"Es Tev Apmulsis\\", \\"Tev ≈†odien Vienalga\\", \\"Es Esmu Tev Dzƒ´slƒÅs\\" in a hit duet with his sister R≈´ta, \\"PasakƒÅ\\" in a duet with Aisha and his 2010 Baltic smash hit \\"Es skrienu\\" (I'm running). Most of his Latvian songs are written in collaboration with MƒÅrti≈Ü≈° Freimanis who wrote lyrics to Lauris's music. Lyrics for songs in English are written by Lauris Reiniks himself, Dutch writer Edward Van De Vendel and American writer Gordon Pogoda. Most of Lauris Reiniks's hit songs in Latvian also have Estonian and Lithuanian versions performed by the artist himself.

Before taking up bobsledding, he had originally started his sporting career in luge, with his most notable result being a third place in doubles in the 1982 World Junior Luge Championships: he switched to bobsleigh in 1988. Biography Huber was a member of Centro Sportivo Carabinieri. He competed in four Winter Olympics and won two medals in the two-man event with one gold (with Antonio Tartaglia in 1998, shared with Canada's Pierre Lueders and David MacEachern) and one bronze (with Stefano Ticci in 1994). Huber also won two medals in the two-man event at the FIBT World Championships with a gold in 1999 and a silver in 1997. His World Championship title came at the end of a troubled four-month period during which his bobsleigh was stolen, and then first Tartaglia and his replacements Massimiliano Rota and Enrico Costa were injured, with the later finally being replaced by Ubaldo Ranzi. Huber took his first World Cup podium during the 1991-92 season with a third in the two-man event at St. Moritz, and scored his first World Cup race win in another two-man race at Lillehammer the following season. He won the Bobsleigh World Cup championship three times (Two-man: 1991-2, 1992-3; Combined men's: 1996-7). He also took six medals at the European Championships, including two golds, one each in two-man and four-man competition. In addition he won eight Italian national titles, seven in two-man and one in four-man. Huber is a bobsleigh coach for the Italian national team as of 2008. He is the brother of lugers Arnold Huber, Norbert Huber and Wilfried Huber.

At 3.18 hectares (7.9 acres) it lies to the south of Whitton village and north west of Stockton-on-Tees. SSSIs are chosen by Natural England, and Whitton Bridge Pasture was designated in 2004 because of its biological interest. It is one of 18 SSSIs in the Cleveland area of search. The biological interest is focused on the species- rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site is small and isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land. Reason for notification SSSIs are designated by Natural England, previously English Nature, which uses the 1974‚Äì1996 county system. This means there is no grouping of SSSIs by Stockton-on-Tees unitary authority, or County Durham which is the relevant ceremonial county. As such Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of 18 SSSIs in the Cleveland area of search. Whitton Bridge Pasture is nationally important for its species-rich grassland which is unimproved by fertilisers. This type of grassland‚Äîonce common in the Tees lowland‚Äîis becoming increasingly rare with its associated species also becoming scarce. Whitton Bridge Pasture is one of only two remaining examples of this habitat in the Tees lowland area. The other example is Briarcroft Pasture, an SSSI about to the south, which was designated at the same time but is significantly smaller. Under the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC) Whitton Bridge Pasture is considered as mesotrophic grassland because it represents well-drained and permanent pasture. In particular it is considered to be an MG5 community because of the species present. MG5 is widespread in many lowland areas in England, Wales, and Scotland, particularly in the Midlands. Whitton Bridge Pasture is predominantly subcommunity MG5c (Danthonia decumbens), however subcommunity MG5a (Lathyrus pratensis) is present with a substantially different species composition. Site description=Abiotic Yorkshire Fog is one of the dominant species in subcommunity MG5c. Located north-west of Stockton-on-Tees and south of the village of Whitton, it is a small site of between a sewage works and Whitton Beck. Topographically the site slopes north towards the stream from a height of to less than . The underlying geology of Whitton Bridge Pasture is responsible for shaping the species-rich community found on the surface. Glacial tills and sands are the prominent geological features resulting in a relatively base-poor soil, characteristic of glacial drift geology. The soils of MG5c (Danthonia decumbens) subcommunity are typically acidic. Because Whitton Bridge Pasture is located in North East England it experiences a climate that is different from the UK average. The North East receives on average less rainfall than the UK over a year. Similarly the North East has roughly 129 days each year with more than of rainfall, more than 25 days fewer than UK average. Despite these differences the temperature is similar for both the North East and the UK, although the North East does have fewer days with air frost and more hours of sunshine per year. Biotic The majority of the site is made up of species-rich grassland (subcommunity MG5c), which comprises three dominant species of grass and several other grass species at lower abundances. The dominant species are Red Fescue (Festuca rubra), Common Bent (Agrostis capillaris) and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus). The less abundant species of grass include, Crested Dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus), Heath-grass (Danthonia decumbens) and Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata). The subcommunity also has many broad-leaved herbs including Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra), Tormentil (Potentilla erecta), Devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis) and Betony (Stachys officinalis). A second subcommunity (MG5a) is present and is characterised by the legume Meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis). Other species present in this subcommunity include Salad burnet (Sanguisorba minor), Quaking grass (Briza media), Pignut (Conopodium majus) and the Orchid species: Common Twayblade (Neottia ovata) and Early Purple Orchid (Orchis mascula). The subcommunity also contains Meadow barley (Hordeum secalinum), a perennial grass, which is a characteristic species of the Tees Lowland. The two subcommunities of MG5, characterised by species rich grassland form a belt across the site, but they do not cover the whole site. Towards the north there is a community dominated by False oat-grass (Arrhenatherum elatius), a constant species in the MG1 and MG2 communities of the British NVC and therefore not typical of an MG5 community. At Whitton Bridge Pasture it is growing on alluvial soils located at the northern edge of the site, which have most likely been formed by Whitton Beck just to the north. A number of springs at the site are associated with flushes of the Pale sedge (Carex pallescens), which form small populations. Management Meadow vetchling is a characteristic species of subcommunity MG5c at Whitton Bridge Pasture. Natural England's role is to advise and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively. To achieve this Natural England provides guidelines for each SSSI. Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it to retain its high species diversity. This means many activities are not allowed at the site including: ploughing, drainage and the use of fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides. Management of the site requires moderate grazing during the summer and autumn to help maintain the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, which was one of the reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter. The small and isolated nature of the site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, which means that the land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it is hoped that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.

It consists of a single 29-minute work broken into two parts when released on LP, and was included on The Major Works of John Coltrane, a compilation CD released in 1992. Om was issued by Impulse! in 1968. The title refers to the sacred sound and spiritual symbol in Indian religions. Coltrane described Om as \\"the first vibration - that sound, that spirit, which set everything else into being. It is The Word from which all men and everything else comes, including all possible sounds that man can make vocally. It is the first syllable, the primal word, the word of power.\\" The recording begins and ends with the musicians chanting in unison a verse from chapter nine of the Bhagavad Gita: > Rites that the Vedas ordain, and the rituals taught by the scriptures, all > these I am, and the offering made to the ghosts of the fathers, herbs of > healing and food. The mantram. The clarified butter. I, the oblation and I, > the flame into which it is offered. I am the sire of the world, and this > world's mother and grandsire. I am he who awards to each the fruit of his > action. I make all things clean. I am Om! In the liner notes, Nat Hentoff wrote: \\"It may be that to break the circumscribed limits of conventional hearing, the ear must be propelled to hear sounds and pitches it has rejected in the past, just as compassion is not come by in conventional comfort. And once heard and absorbed, these sounds lead to further extensions of listening and feeling capacities... In so far as one can ever advise anyone else in how to listen, I would suggest that they start by not worrying about how it is all structured, where it's leading. Let the music come in without any pre-set definitions of what jazz has to be, of what music has to be.\\"  Background  Om was recorded the day after Coltrane and his band played live in Seattle, as documented by recording engineer (and sometime drummer) Jan Kurtis. The next day the whole band traveled to Kurtis' studio, Camelot Sound Studios, in a rented house in Lynnwood, to record Om. It is believed that Coltrane was using LSD during the recording, though this is disputed. (Lewis Porter wrote that \\"Coltrane may have been tripping on LSD when he recorded Om. It is certain that he did begin using LSD around this time,\\" \\"according to four reliable sources, speaking off the record.\\") According to Eric Nisenson, Coltrane, \\"clearly embarrassed by Om, instructed Bob Thiele that he never wanted it released.\\" However, Thiele, the director and producer of Impulse!, did release it in 1968 to capitalize on Coltrane's death and on the growing psychedelic rock scene at the time. Upon its release, \\"a copy was almost immediately placed in the window of the Haight-Ashbury Psychedelic Shop.\\"  Reception  Opinions regarding Om have been mixed. David Nelson McCarthy called it \\"Coltrane's only major release of questionable quality... featuring screechy playing and moaning vocals, this is for true believers and historical interest only.\\" Ben Ratliff described it as \\"a fairly disjointed, agitated, muddy, twenty-nine-minutes catharsis.\\" An Allmusic review by Stacia Proefrock commented: \\"Condemned by many critics as John Coltrane's worst album, Om suffers only in comparison to the great works that preceded it... Om... seems... like a pure release of energy... Regardless of its seeming chaos, this is a deeply spiritual work... Om resonates with passion and yearning, but has a frantic edge that suggests that opening up to all of that powerful spiritual energy might have been a frightening experience... Om doesn't deserve the dismissal it has been given by critics. It is an important work in the history of free jazz that opens up considerably by the end of its 29 minutes, revealing the expansive contents of a jazz master's mind.\\" Guerino Mazzola and Paul Cherlin wrote that \\"Compared to the other LPs of that year (1965), Om lives on another planet... This journey is not for beginners... It would be fair to listen to this performance without any reference to jazz or to any other disciplined utterance of music.\\" Track listing Note: while some CD configurations had \\"Om\\" as a single track, others kept the original LP record's two-track configuration.

After graduating in canon and civil law he went to Rome where he gained the esteem of Clement XI, who on 5 December 1701, appointed him legate a latere to the East Indies and the Qing Empire of China. The purpose of this legation was to establish harmony among the missionaries there; to provide for the needs of these extensive missions; to report to the Holy See on the general state of the missions, and the labours of the missionaries and to enforce the decision of the Holy Office against the further toleration of the so-called Chinese rites among the native Christians. These rites consisted chiefly in offering sacrifices to Confucius and the ancestors, and in using the Chinese names TiƒÅn (heaven) and Sh√†ngd√¨ (supreme emperor) for the God of the Christians. On 27 December 1701, the Pope consecrated Tournon bishop in the Vatican Basilica, with the title of Patriarch of Antioch. The legate left Europe on the French royal vessel Maurepas on 9 February 1703, arriving at Pondicherry in India on 6 November 1703. On 23 June 1704, Tournon issued at this place the decree Inter graviores, summarily forbidding the missionaries under severe censures to permit the further practice of the Malabar rites. On 11 July 1704, Tournon set sail for China by way of the Philippine Islands, arriving at Macau in China, 2 April, and at Beijing on 4 December 1705. The Kangxi Emperor received him kindly at first, but upon hearing that he came to abolish the Chinese rites among the native Christians, he demanded from all missionaries on pain of immediate expulsion a promise to retain these rites. At Rome, the Holy Office had meanwhile decided against the rites on 20 November 1704, and being acquainted with this decision, the legate issued a decree at Nanjing on 25 January 1707, obliging the missionaries under pain of excommunication latae sententiae to abolish these rites. Hereupon, the Kangxi Emperor ordered Tournon to be imprisoned at Macau and sent some Jesuit missionaries to Rome to protest against the decree. Tournon died in prison, shortly after being informed that he had been created cardinal on 1 August 1707. Upon the announcement of his death at Rome, Clement XI highly praised him for his courage and loyalty to the Holy See and ordered the Holy Office to issue a Decree (25 September 1710) approving the acts of the legate. Tournon's remains were brought to Rome by his successor, Carlo Ambrogio Mezzabarba, and buried in the church of the Propaganda Fide on 27 September 1723.

It is part of Pollino National Park. Geography Papasidero is situated on a rocky spur 210 m above the sea level and is crossed by Lao and Santo Nocajo rivers. It is 18 km from SA-RC motorway and 23 km from the Tyrrhenian sea. Its territory covers an area of 54 square km and is entirely part of Pollino National Park. History The name Papasidero derives from the name of an abbot (in Greek Papas-Isidoros, father or priest Isidore) head of a monastery in the Mercuriense Region, home of Basilian Greek monasticism. Humans have occupied the area since prehistoric times, as confirmed by an important archaeological site, LaGrotta Romito, discovered in 1961. The historical centre has a typically medieval urban style. It was built over the 12th and 13th centuries. From Lombard beginnings, it became a fortress castle in the Sveva Norman period (1190‚Äì1250) and was expanded under the Angioino in the 14th century, and under Aragon (from 1400 to 1500). The church of Saint Constantine became a parish in 1510. The place was possessed by the descendants of the Norman Alitto of Sanseverino and Spinelli di Scalea until 1806. Since 1593 a Monte di Piet√† has operated, set up by Owen Lewis (Ludovico Audoeno) who was Bishop of Cassano; and starting from the 17th century the Brotherhood of the Assumption. Carlo Paolino (1723‚Äì1803) humanist, Francesco Mastroti (1777‚Äì1847) teacher, and Maria Angelica Mastroti (1851‚Äì1891) mystic, were all born here. Main sights *The abandoned village of Avena. The Mother Church has a Byzantine fresco from the early 11th century. *Grotto of the Romito, 13 km outside Papasidero, discovered in 1961 and housing pre-historic graffiti. *Sanctuary of Constantinople (17th-18th centuries) Sanctuary of Constantinople A Byzantine church dating from the year one thousand, the Mother Shrine of Constantinople XVII Century was built in the middle of 600 was extended to the end of 700 and in the first half of the 19th century. It has a T plan with three naves. A large fresco was painted between 700 and 800, depicting the Virgin and Child and a bishop kneeling before the high Archangel Michele who pierces Satan in flames. Romito Cave This important discovery, which occurred in 1961 in the territory of Papasidero, has shed a light on events in prehistoric northern Calabria, and showed that it was inhabited at least 20,000 years ago. The Romito man was a Cro-Magnon; he did not keep cattle or practise agriculture or make ceramics. The cave is divided into two distinct areas: the actual cave, about twenty metres deep, which goes into the limestone formation with a narrow dark tunnel, and the guard that extends for about 34 metres east‚Äìwest. Homo sapiens occupied the cave continuously leaving countless relics of bone and stone tools, wonderful graffiti and their skeletal remains. Carbon 14 dating proves occupation since 4470 BC (Neolithic). In the Upper Paleolithic layers, the oldest dating is around 16,800 BC. The figure of a bull, about 1.2 metres long, is engraved on a boulder of about 2.3 metres in length at an angle of 45¬∞. The design of perfect proportions, is made with stretch safely. The nostrils, mouth, eye and ear are represented with some care. Folds in the skin of the neck are clear and the cloven foot is very accurately shown. Below the great figure of a bull, another bovine figure has been cut, much more subtly, showing only the chest, head and part of the back. In front of the rock with the cattle, there is another figure about 3.5 metres long, with a linear cut, whose meaning is incomprehensible. The occupation of the Neolithic cave of Romito (:it:Grotta del Romito) is documented by the discovery of fifty ceramic pieces that reveal trade in obsidian from the Aeolian Islands. The place of their discovery, and the facsimile of a tomb dated from 9200 years BC, can be visited. Two individuals have been arranged in a well-defined ritual.A Case of Chondrodystrophic Dwarfism in the Italian Late Upper Paleolithic // American Journal of Physical Anthropology 75:549-565 (1988)Mallegni Francesco, Fabbri Pier Francesco. The human skeletal remains from the upper palaeolithic burials found in Romito cave (Papasidero, Cosenza, Italy). In: Bulletins et M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© d'anthropologie de Paris, Nouvelle S√©rie. Tome 7 fascicule 3-4, 1995. pp. 99-137. One burial was found in the cave and another two couples in the shelter of the rock overhang just outside the cave, not far from the rock with the figure of the bull. Of these pairs of skeletons, the first is kept in the National Museum of Reggio Calabria, the second is in the Florentine Museum of Prehistory. The third is still being studied by the Institute of Prehistory of Florence. Recent excavations have unearthed the remains of a fourth burial, even more ancient, clear evidence of an intense occupation by prehistoric man. About 300 obsidian chips have been found in the different layers of the shelter and the cave. The Archaeological Park contains a small museum, teaching all the essential information. Lao River The Lao river is a short perennial river on the Tyrrhenian side of Calabria. It takes its name from the town of Laos, a city of Magna Grecia. Over 50 km long, it originates in Basilicata from Monte Serra del Prete on the Massif Pollino, 2000m in altitude. It is known in the territory of Viggianello (PZ), as the Mercure. Here the river runs from E-W to NE-SW. Where the tributaries meet the river is named the Lao. From this point there is abundant water throughout the year. It enters a spectacular gorge flowing for several kilometres. Despite great variations in flow (especially in autumn when it can lead to massive flooding), the Lao is clearly distinguishable from other rivers of the region for its average flow (of about 10 m/s) and its minimum (in summer rarely dropping below 4 m/s), thanks to the remarkable permeability of a large part of its catchment, making it the most important watercourse of Tyrrhenian Calabria, by volume of water and the most important in summer. Because of these unique characteristics, and for the purity of its waters, and the beauty and length of the Ingoli stretch, the river is popular with fans of rafting and canoeing. The Lao also gives its name to the Riserva Statale Valle del Fiume Lao, established in 1987 within the National Park of Pollino.

History Model of the old town of Le Landeron South gate of the town Le Landeron is first mentioned about 1209 as Landiron. Prehistory The first traces of human habitation near Le Landeron were the remains of a pottery workshop (961-957 BC) discovered on the banks of the Thielle. At Les Carougets there is a grave from the late Bronze Age, a Roman villa and traces of the foundations of huts from the Early Middle Ages. Furthermore, several Roman statuettes have been discovered, including Hercules, a rooster and what may be a peacock. Middle Ages The name Le Landeron appears for the first time around 1209, as a place name mentioned in the fishing rights of the neighboring Benedictine monastery of St. Johannsen in Erlach. Since it was given as a place name, it appears that the area where the town now stands was not inhabited. The nearby houses were up in the Jura hills and were grouped under the name Nugerol. The area around what is now La Tour was once the site of a fortification, which was destroyed around 1309. The Duke of Austria forbade anyone to rebuild the fortifications. On 1 September 1325, Rudolph IV of Neuch√¢tel bought the Le Landeron meadow in the Thielle valley. In 1328-29 he built a fortified town there. The town was founded to protect the eastern part of the county of Neuch√¢tel and to control the streets and waterways of the Jura foothills. Le Landeron took the old rights of Nugerol which were comparable to those of citizens of Neuchatel. In 1350 Count Louis of Neuch√¢tel officially recognized that these rights applied to the town. In 1373, the new mistress of the town, Varenne of Neuch√¢tel, granted it some additional rights and it became the capital of the Barony of Le Landeron. However, in 1424, the Barony came back under the direct rule of the Counts of Neuchatel. They retained the right to rule themselves as a mostly independent town. They had their own town banner and a town council in which the citizens of Cressier appointed a third of the members. Early modern age In 1449 Le Landeron entered into a treaty with Solothurn that was to shape the religious affairs of the town. During the Protestant Reformation, the town's rulers were supported by Solothurn when they chose to remain by the old faith. Of all the neighboring municipalities, only Ligni√®res converted to the Reformed faith in 1556. Since then, Le Landeron has stubbornly defended its religious particularity. The town remained loyal to Marie, the Duchess of Nemours during her conflicts with her step-daughter over the inheritance. After the extinction of her line in 1707, Le Landeron submitted to Frederick I, King of Prussia after he threatened military force. Modern Le Landeron After the founding of the Republic of Neuch√¢tel in 1848, the towns of Le Landeron and Cressier began to separate. Then, in 1868, they separated completely and each town granted citizenship in town to all residents. During the 19th century the traditional farming and wine growing town began to change. The Jura water correction drained the surrounding swamps and opened up much of the valley to agriculture. In 1869-70 a train station was built and industry moved into the town. The first industries to settle in Le Landeron were parts suppliers for the watch industry. While the old town has preserved its compact and fortified appearance, many new homes were built on the Jura slopes. Because of the number of immigrants from Reformed areas into the town, they founded a Reformed parish in 1894. During the 20th century agriculture declined in importance (in 1910 there were 320 agriculture jobs while in 2000 it was only 45). Every year since 1973 one of the largest antiques markets in Switzerland (F√™te de la brocante) is held in Le Landeron. In 1974, the town was connected to the A5 motorway. In 1991 one of the five secondary school regional centers of the Canton of Neuch√¢tel (Les Deux- Thielle) was opened in town. At the beginning of the 21st century it is a residential community with numerous, especially in the microtechnology industry, specialized small businesses and possessed the second-largest wine growing region in the canton.

When she entered her teens she started dating local farmboy Jack Sugden. But in February 1964, he left Beckindale and Ruth, as she was then known, got together with Tom Merrick when she learned she was pregnant. They married in April 1964. Later that year she gave birth to a son Jackie and two years later a daughter, Sandie. Tom questioned the paternity of Jackie as a result his being born seven months early and his resemblance to Jack Sugden. The Merrick family left Beckindale for Leeds in 1972 when Jack returned to the village and offered Ruth ¬£100. Ruth returned briefly in January 1974 to see her sister Janie Blakey. Return to Beckindale In September 1980, Ruth, now calling herself Pat, returned to Beckindale with Jackie and Sandie to stay with her aunt Elsie after she left Tom for good. But Elsie would not take them in as her children would make a lot of noise. Ny Estates found her a home in a grotty, stuffy caravan. Later that year Tom came back to town but by this time Pat had started dating Jack again. Tom tried to frame Jack in an arson attack of which Jack had an alibi. Seth Armstrong found out the truth and told Tom to leave Beckindale with threats of disclosure. Marriage to Jack Sugden In 1982, Pat and Jack married with Matt as best man and Sandie as bridesmaid. Pat and Jack were happy for quite a while until in 1984 when Jack had an affair with reporter Karen Moore. The couple split up for a while but later got back together. Robert and death In 1985, Pat learned she was pregnant and gave birth to a son, Robert Jacob Sugden, in April 1986 which brought her and Jack closer together. In August, tragedy struck when Pat died after her car crashed down a hillside when she swerved to avoid a flock of sheep. She had been returning home from dropping her sister Janie off at the train station after a visit. Pat's funeral was held on 2 September 1986 and she was buried in the village churchyard.

Lungro is one of the most prominent centers of the Arb√´resh√´ people and the seat of the Eparchy of Lungro. This jurisdiction of the Catholic Church preserved the Byzantine rite and the local language, and encompasses all the Arb√´resh√´-speaking communities in the area. The eparchy is part of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. Lungro is also part of the largest nature reserve in Italy, the Pollino National Park.  Geography  The town is situated 67 km north of Cosenza at the foot of Mount Petrosa at 650 meters above sea level on the Campolongo plateau, flanked by the rivers Galatro and Tiro. It is bordered to the east by the municipality of Saracena, to the south by Firmo and Altomonte, and to the northwest by Acquaformosa. The landscape is mostly mountainous towards the north, with beech and chestnut groves, while vineyards and fields are in the southern part.  History  Lungro was founded in the second half of the 15th century CE by ethnic Albanian settlers, and developed around a Basilian monastery on lands that had been granted in 1156 from feudal landowner Ogerio del Vasto Altomonte. The Albanians who migrated were housed in the area around 1486. They were welcomed by Abbot Paul with the approval of Prince of Bisignano, Geronimo Sanseverino, when Albanian resistance led and organized by George Castriot or Skanderbeg against the Ottoman conquest dissipated shortly thereafter his death in 1468. Following these events the most significant migration of Albanians was recorded in Italy and led to the foundation of Lungro. In 1525 the Basilian monastery was abandoned, after helping the fugitives through a period of deep crisis. It became available to the Commandery Pontiff and the inhabitants of Lungro were able to resist all attempts by the feudal lords to control civil jurisdiction and policy. In the second half of the 17th century and the 18th century, fighting intensified between the baronial families of Sanseverino Altomonte and Pescara Saracen. Many political clashes occurred over the acquisition of certain rights of barons' fiefs. Over the years, age-old religious conflicts intensified between the Byzantine rite Albanians and the Latin rite of the neighboring populations. Many priests were imprisoned Albanians from the practice of the Eastern rite, but Lungresi gathered around them and fought to maintain their religious identity. From 1768 Albanians of Lungro tenaciously undertook the defense of its Greek-Byzantine liturgical rite, because, coming from Southern Albania, they were under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople. For centuries, thanks to the work of the Byzantine Church, they retained their own rite. In February 1897, Girolamo de Rada, Giuseppe Schir√≤ and Anselmo Lorecchio from the Arb√´resh√´ community organised a congress on the Albanian question that convened in Lungro. The resolution of the Lungro congress called for a unified Albanian alphabet and an Albanian dictionary, the founding of an Albanian national society and the need for the Arb√´resh√´ to have relations with the Albanian mother country. L 'Eparchy of Lungro is the fundamental point of reference for the Italo-Albanian mainland, and continues to cherish the traditional religious, linguistic and cultural identity Arb√´resh√´. The eparchy was created on February 13 of 1919 by Pope Benedict XV and the first Eparch was John Apples, succeeded by John Stamati and Ercole Lupinacci.  Etymology  The name \\"Lungru\\" appears for the first time in history around the 12th century. The etymology of \\"Lungrum\\" or \\"Ugrium\\" seems to refer to the specific humidity of its territory. According to Domenico De Marchis, its name derived from the Greek Ugros (wet, fluid, water). This hypothesis is supported also by the name of the ancient monastery of the hamlet of Lungro, was rapidly gaining prestige and soon became one of the most important spiritual centers of Byzantine and Greek culture.  Places of interest  The traditional architecture of Albania is mostly circular in shape. Most buildings in Lungro were built around a square with a circular facade. All openings were to the main square. Each cluster of houses was a district whose name was derived from elements in the area: Kastieli (a castle), Bregu (coast of the hill slope), Konxa (Icon - presence of the Church of Santa Maria of Constantinople with the icon of the Madonna. The church has a square shape, reflecting the canons of the Byzantine rite, the first built by the Albanians), Shin LLiri (Church of St. Elijah), Kriqi (crucifix), Abbots (at one time, the Abbey of St. Mary). The village centers around two central squares along a path crossing that connects to the outside. It is located in the slope, filling a compact but irregular shape. It is characterized by buildings of popular roots, in urban and rural areas, including housing units and small chapels. Among the narrow streets of the historic district, architectural types are distinguished by gjitonia (neighborhoods and doors of medieval and ancient palaces). The gjitonia is a sector of the district, forming a social group with its own rules. The area retains architectural, religious and civil structures, as well as small industrial facilities. These remnants reflect symbolic \\"protection\\" in the region, particularly of shrines like those of St. Leonard and St. Elias on the streets of the same name. To commemorate the mines of rock salt, a monument-stage course of Skanderbeg (representing miners at work) has been established, next to the town house. A museum of the salt mine was created that is complete with costumes, tools, artifacts and writings of the time. In Lungro, as in most Arb√´resh√´ settlements, the main square displays a bust of Skanderbeg, to honor their ethnic and linguistic origins.  Religious architecture  Cathedral of St. Nicholas of Myra = The Cathedral of St. Nicholas of Myra (Qisha and Sh√´n Kollit, 18th century), is the principal church of the Eparchy of Lungro. The building was built in 1721, after the late 17th century earthquake destroyed its predecessor. The cathedral is large relative to local churches. It is in the Romanesque-Baroque style, with three aisles, a large Apse and Dome center. Mosaics, icons and Byzantine paintings, reflected the beauty of Eastern Christian sacred structures. The sanctuary is separated from the rest of the Church 'Iconostasis, the first made in a church after the establishment of the eparchy. In 1825 the structure of the church was complete, although it was not possible to fix a precise date of completion of the art installation. The mosaic works decorative elements of the nave and aisles of the Temple. Since 1921, after the erection of the Eparchy of Lungro in 1919 by Pope Benedict XV, the Church of St. Nicholas of Myra, elevated to a cathedral, undergoes profound changes, to be adapted to the needs of the Byzantine rite- Greek. The Romanesque-Baroque Church, while not altering the walls and the original design of the sacred building, lends itself, with its wide open spaces, to be aligned with the philosophy and liturgical needs of the Church of 'East. The cathedral is full of Mosaics. The mosaic of Pantocrator covers the entire surface of the 120 m¬≤ central dome, which is internal and does not leak from the roof and has a height of 18 meters. Also important is the vast mosaic of the apse, surmounted by a mosaic of Platitera and surrounded by figures of the archangels Gabriel and Michael, from King David and the prophet Isaiah, and the mosaic of the Chapel of the baptismal font, designed by painter and mosaic artist Albanian Joseph Droboniku, who executed the great mosaic of Christ Pantocrator with the central dome. He also did the mosaic of Judgement, overlooking the central nave. In the vestry is a valuable record of ancient medieval Byzantine church of Santa Maria delle Fonti, consisting of a fragment of fresco, which depicts St. Paraskeva (12th century), together with valuable paintings of the Neapolitan school and wooden statues of exquisite workmanship. The aisles of the Temple, already painted by K. Tsitlavidis Macedonian painter, were recently enriched with paintings of Greek artists Charalambos and Gregory of Thessaloniki, which respect the canons of the Byzantine traditional color. Placed on the left aisle, the six canvases depicting the life of St. Nicholas of Myra, the patron of Lungro. The works of the south aisle represent the life of Jesus Christ. Of great artistic workmanship are the three bronze doors with reliefs made using the lost wax sculptor Calabrian Talarico representing Gospel scenes. The windows of the Temple and the two aisles depict prophets. = Church of Santa Maria Icon = Church of Santa Maria Icon ( Qisha and Sh√´n MERIS and Konxis, 16th century) is located on a cliff near the river Tyre. In the 16th century the river was the border between Lungro and Saracen. It was the first church built in honor of Our Lady of Albanians Odigitria, much venerated in the East. Inside sits the first evidence of Byzantine iconography of stone that represents the Madonna and Child. The coffered wooden ceiling was built in 1663 by Angelo The Calabrian artist Petra. The poster, stolen recently, framed the precious icon. Its building is located on the northeast border of the medieval village. The Albanians settled in the highest part of the village (Bregu ka) and built their houses near the village. The village began at the monastery of Santa Maria delle Fonti southwest and ended with the church of Santa Maria. = St. Elias = The church of St. Elias (Qisha and Sh√´n Llirit, end of 17th century), rises to a point that probably served as a lookout post for the inhabitants of the surrounding hamlet. The church is dedicated to St. Elias the prophet, is located on a picturesque cliff gorge over the river starting from Tyre. It rises dramatically above the church of Santa Maria Icon. On the south side is the cave of St. Elias, a deep inlet between the stones. During the Renaissance the cult of the Saint was very popular since St. Elias was considered the liberator of the Albanian people of Lungro from Bourbon repression. Some verses survive in Albaniania are sung by the faithful in the Saint's procession. They were written by poet Vincent Stratigo in 1852. Thereafter, the Bourbon government forbade the procession because of their revolutionary significance.

Established in 1919 at the behest of Pope Benedict XV's Eparchy of Lungro, the churches under its jurisdiction were from the province of Cosenza and beyond. The Mass and all the religious celebrations are performed in Greek, Albanian and, on rare occasions, Italian. Many difficulties had to be overcome in preserving religious identity given the constant attacks by the dominant culture. The Byzantine Rite follows the canon law of Orthodox, its own liturgical calendar and uses Oriental ceremonies. The Mass is that of Saint John Chrysostom, which is celebrated in the Greek language in solemn ceremonies and in the Albanian language in daily functions. The peculiarities of the Eastern rite are evident in sacred vestments, the veneration of holy icons as well as the Church's architecture. In the Byzantine Rite, Baptism (Pag√´zim), Confirmation (V√´rtetim) and Eucharist (Kungjimi) are administered together as Communion. The Holy Week (Java and Madhe) starts on the eve of Palm Sunday and ends on the eve of Easter Sunday (Pashk√´t). It is among the most important and evocative Byzantine liturgical calendar holidays.

One type of women's costumes is for parties and the other for daily activities. Party clothes consist of teo petticoats (sutanina), a pleated skirt with red satin (kamizola) with the edges of twisted gold wire (galuni), a pleated satin skirt. A blue shell is collected and supported on the arm (COFA), a lacy white blouse (linja), a short blue waistcoat is embroidered in gold (xhipuni), hair parted in the middle, braided with ribbons and gathered behind in kesa. Married women (bread) wear a red shawl. Daily dress consists of a red pleated skirt edged with green, white shirt, an apron (vandizini), a black vest with white embroidery. For special events and religious festivals Albanian men sport white pants (brek√´t t√´ bardha) with red or blue side stripes and embroidered in yellow shirt (kemish) white, black embroidered vest and hat (k√´leshi) white wool in the shape of a truncated cone.  Cuisine  The food ( t√´ ngr√´nit') highlights its Mediterranean influence. Pasta is served in all its forms: macaroni (rrashkatjelt), gnocchi (strangulrat), lasagne (tumac), noodles (fidhilt), bucatini (hullonjrat), served with simple sauces of fresh tomato and basil, or with sauces made from pork or lamb. Among the specialties is Shtridh√´lat fasule me, a hand-made pasta finely seasoned with a tomato sauce and beans. It is a typical dish of Albanian origin. The cheese is processed by hand and its texture approaches that of the noodles. Another typical dish is Dromsat, made of flour and water, seasoned with fresh tomato sauce and peppers. Among the main courses, mushrooms are prized for their abundance in the mountains. Other dishes include mushrooms with peppers (k√´purdh√´ kangariqra me) and mushrooms and potatoes (k√´purdh√´ pataka me). Stews include dry sausage and peppers (I saucic√´ stufatjel) and pork chops and peppers (stufatjel brinjaz derku me). Pig offal (drudhezit), boiled meat (cingaridhet), gelatin (puftea) and salami Lungro with its characteristic aroma of fennel are popular. The cheese, produced from the high altitude pastures, is rich in herbs. Robust local wines of the vineyard of Galzei (Gauxet), or fine wines from DOC Pollino include sweet varieties such as kula√ßi. Wedding cakes are made of honey. The sweet Christmas grispellet is called xhuxhullet, kanarikulit bukunotet. Sweets for Easter are nusezat, biscuits with flour (viscote t√´ pirv√´luar√´), oil and aniseed. The fruit seccha is eaten with Lungro figs ( fiq√´ t√´ bardha and kriqezit).  Economy = Salt  A large salt mine operates near Lungro. The salt was found in Roman times. It bought great wealth, and gained Lungro a mention in the writings of Pliny. Later the salt was sold across Calabria and, more recently, across Europe. It gave work to many local people and drew in outsiders. Each worker started and ended his shift by walking down or up 2,000 steps to the mine. Saint Leonardo was adopted as the Patron Saint of the salt mines, and a small church was dedicated to him. The church sank into the ground due to hydrological challenges. The mine was abandoned in 1976. In 2010 it was commemorated by a museum.

They were part of Marine Air Control Group 48 (MACG-48) and the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW) and were based out in Pasadena, California. Mission Provide close-in air defense protection for Marine Air Ground Task Force assets, key installations and vital area within the area of operations including protection of units operating in forward combat areas or engaged in special independent operations. History The 4th Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion traces its origin back to October 1, 1972, when the 4th Forward Area Air Defense (FAAD) Battery was activated as a combat support unit under the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. From 1972 to 1988, 4th FAAD Battery consisted of (4) Firing Platoons and a Headquarters and Service platoon. FAAD teams employed the Red Eye shoulder- launched surface-to-air missile and used the M1A1 Jeep for missile transport and tactical mobility. In 1988, 4th FAAD Battery transitioned from the Red Eye and Jeep to the Stinger surface-to-air missile and the Humvee. On July 1, 1989, 4th FAAD Battery was re-designated as the 4th Low Altitude Air Defense Battalion and was assigned to Marine Air Control Group 48, 4th Marine Aircraft Wing. The re-designation increased the size of the unit from four platoons to a Battalion headquarters, one Firing Battery and a Headquarters and Service Battery. At that time, 4th FAAD Detachment Alpha in Marietta, Georgia, was also re-designated as 4th LAAD Battalion, Detachment Alpha and increased in size from three platoons to a Firing Battery and a Headquarters and Service Detachment. Several significant events have occurred in the unit following the re-designation. In November 1990, a platoon of 45 Stinger gunners and communication operators deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. The platoon was assigned to the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade to augment the active duty LAAD forces. In 1995, the Avenger weapon system was fielded to the unit. The avenger is a HMMWV- based Stinger platform that provides enhanced night engagement capabilities and the ability to shoot on the move. In the summer of 2004 the 4th LAAD Battalion was activated as a provisional security unit in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. For the first time, both elements of the battalion were combined into a single unit, and were augmented with an active duty unit (Battery K, 3rd Battalion, 10th Marines) and fellow reserve unit (Battery P, 5th Battalion 14th Marines) to form a provisional security battalion. Deployed to Al Asad Airbase, located in Iraq's Al Anbar province, the battalion's mission was ensuring the security of the base through checkpoints, towers, and various internal and external patrolling. The battalion was tasked with other roles such as security escorts for humanitarian missions and reconstruction efforts in the area and providing security for various visiting officials, including the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. 4th LAAD Battalion also participated in support of Iraq's January 2005 legislative elections. For their efforts in Iraq, the battalion received a Navy Unit Commendation. After redeployment to the United States in March 2005, 4th LAAD Battalion was soon disbanded.

Geography The town is bordered by Marano Principato, Montalto Uffugo, Paola, Rende, San Lucido and San Vincenzo La Costa. San Fili is 566 meters above sea level. History The town once called Felum later became Terra Sancti Felicis, in honor of San Felice, to whom the population was devoted to the parish church of that time. The denomination San Fili took place later and in the fifteenth century, the town became part of the county of Rende belonging to the Adorno Doges of Genoa from 1445 to 1529. From 1532 Rende (and therefore San Fili) was raised to the marquisate and included to Ferrente de Alarcone. San Fili has a fraction and two districts of certain importance: the Bucita fraction and the Frassino and Cozzi district. They made it illustrious San Fili: Vincenzo Miceli (1858-1928) a professor of Constitutional Law and then of Philosophy of Law in the University of Pisa, Palermo, and Perugia, and again Alfonso Miceli, his brother (1855-1940) president of the Court of Appeal of Naples, both natives of San Fili and belonging to the homonymous baronial family of the Miceli of Serradileo. In more recent times by Baron Marcello Miceli (1918-1992) Gentleman of His Holiness Paul VI, John Paul I, and John Paul II, and Knight of Grace and Devotion of the Sovereign Order of Malta. Several Sanfilesi have emigrated to Canada and the United States, and a significant number also to South America (Argentina and Brazil above all), as well as many emigrants to European countries such as Germany and Switzerland. Today the descendants of Sanfilesi emigrants are a large number; an example is a Canadian community which appears to have reached 6,000 units.

She was first played by Madeleine Howard from 1988 until 1994 then by Alyson Spiro from 1994 until 2000. Storylines Sarah was first introduced as a librarian at the local library of Beckindale and befriended Archie Brooks (Tony Pitts), Kathy Merrick (Malandra Burrows) and Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay).Sarah marries Jack. She also became friendly with local farmer Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby) when he returned a book to the library but when she asked him out he rejected her advances because he had lost his wife Pat (Helen Weir) a year and a half earlier and had to look after his two- year-old son Robert Sugden (Richard Smith). But in April 1989 they got together and Sarah treated Robert like her own. However, Jack and Pat's 24-year-old son Jackie Merrick (Ian Sharrock) didn't like Sarah and tried to get Robert away from her any time he could, not wanting their mother's memory to be forgotten. But eventually Sarah's best friend and Jackie's wife Kathy got the two to be friends. During 1989, Jack left for Italy to see old flame Marian Wilks (Debbi Blythe) leaving Sarah unaware of where they stood. Jack returned in August after Jackie is killed in a gun accident but made a permanent return in November which a nosey Amos Brearly (Ronald Magill) made sure Sarah was aware of. Jack declared his relationship with Marian was over and it was Sarah he wanted. In 1990, Sarah agreed to move in with Jack in the farm but kept the connecting door nailed shut to stop his mother Annie Sugden's (Sheila Mercier) habit of wandering in declaring she was used to living alone. Sarah at first refused to help out on the farm but later agreed when the Sugdens found themselves shorthanded. The mobile library closed in June 1990 so Jack got her a job as barmaid in the woolpack working for Amos and Henry Wilks (Arthur Pentelow) who were impressed with her work ethic. When mad man Jim Latimer (Dennis Blanch) was released from jail for the murder of Jack's cousin Sharon, he swore revenge on Jack who was a witness at his trial in 1973, for murder. He took Sarah hostage in an abandoned warehouse where he said he'd keep her but Jack and Annie's son Joe Sugden (Frazer Hines) rescued Sarah who was unharmed and Latimer was subsequently arrested. In January 1994, Jack proposed to Sarah. By then they had discovered Sarah was pregnant and in March 1994, Sarah gave birth to their daughter Victoria Sugden (Jessica Heywood). In May 1994, Jack and Sarah married but weeks after the wedding, Victoria stopped breathing and a hole in her heart was found. She nearly died but a part of Sarah's heart was taken to save Victoria's life. In 1996, Robert brought a friend home called Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher) who was from the children's home after his mother and grandmother had died and his father Billy (David Crellin) was in jail. Jack and Sarah decided to adopt him and he eventually became a Sugden. Billy escaped from prison at Christmas 1998 and tried to rob the post office accidentally killing Vic Windsor (Alun Lewis). Andy confessed to Jack about where Billy was hiding and he was taken away by the police while Vic's hysterical widow Viv (Deena Payne) shouted abuse at Andy for hiding his father. Sarah had never got on with Viv and the two often exchanged insults towards each other. Indeed, Scott Windsor (Toby Cockerel; Ben Freeman) always disliked Sarah, but this was generally unrelated to the animosity between his mother and Sarah. Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) also held a particular dislike for Sarah, as was evident over Kathy and the Graham incident. Her attitude was seen by many - Eric Pollard and the Windsors included - as somewhat holier-than-thou and thus they resented her for it. Pollard was also to blame for village gossip which seemingly blamed Sarah and Jack for poor parenting which amounted to Billy killing Vic. In 1997, the Sugdens were evicted from the farm by Frank Tate (Norman Bowler) so he could get a quarry built but they moved into a new farm. Soon after, Jack began an affair with Sarah's friend, Rachel Tate (Glenda McKay). When Sarah found out, she threw Jack out but they reconciled a year later. However, Sarah found living with Jack more difficult than she thought and in 1999, Rachel was murdered by her boyfriend Graham Clark (Kevin Pallister) and she realized that Jack still had feelings for Rachel. Sarah felt unsure about how to feel regarding Rachel's death, as despite her affair with Jack, the two women had been extremely close in the years before. Sarah was determined not to become a traditional farmer's wife like Annie and went away for a few weeks to clear her head. When she returned, she was furious with Jack about the changes he had made in her absence, including stopping Andy and Robert from going to school so they could work on the farm. She insisted that they go back to school and got a job at Kathy's diner so they could afford to employ people on the farm. At Christmas, Sarah bought Robert and Andy the video games they wanted despite the family's financial problems, causing more tension between her and Jack. Despite vowing to make their marriage work, Jack sold Sarah's car to Ashley Thomas and confided in Sarah's friend, Kathy, about his marriage problems. This infuriated Sarah. Sarah supported Kathy when she was nearly killed by Graham, having exposed him as Rachel's killer. Like most of Emmerdale's residents, Sarah wasn't very friendly with Eric Pollard but got on with him in general. However, when Eric called Graham a murderer and no one believed him, Sarah was the particular target of his anger and he verbally attacked her in front of a busy Kathy's Diner. Eric also managed to wind Sarah up into nearly throwing ketchup in his face when he snidely commented on the state of her marriage. In early 2000, the cracks in Jack and Sarah's marriage became even more evident. Even Sarah and Victoria nearly being killed in a bus crash was not enough to save it. Sarah then had an affair with Jack's lodger, Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont), and she and Jack split up when the truth came out in May. Jack refused Sarah access to the children and a custody battle followed. Andy resented Sarah for what she did to Jack and chose to stay with Jack but Robert remained loyal to Sarah and turned to her about changing his GCSEs when Jack was not interested. Despite this, Jack was awarded custody of Robert due to Sarah not being his biological mother. In October 2000, Sarah won custody of Victoria but Richie, who was meant to be babysitting, left her alone in the house late at night. Furious, Jack attacked Sarah in the Woolpack and threatened to kill her and Richie, to the horror of Bernice Blackstock (Samantha Giles), Terry Woods (Billy Hartman) and most of the village. Understanding Jack's anger at Richie's carelessness, Sarah decided to dump him and reconcile with Jack to make things work for the children's sake; even realising she still loved Jack. Leaving Victoria with Angie Reynolds (Freya Copeland), she went to visit Jack at the farm. Richie persuaded her to talk so Sarah suggested they do so in the barn. Hearing someone enter the barn and thinking it was Jack, they hid behind a haybale. It was actually Andy setting fire to the barn for the insurance company in hope of solving Jack's financial problems. Richie managed to climb down the ladder, avoiding the soaring flames, but Sarah was too scared to move. A blast threw Richie off his feet but the ladder up to the haybales fell down, sealing Sarah's fate. After a lot of persuasion, Richie was struggling to breathe due to the smoke so left the barn alone. Meanwhile, Jack had heard the disturbance outside and ran out to see the barn on fire and Richie choking on the ground outside. Sarah is engulfed in flames whilst screaming for Jack. Jack tried to rescue her but stumbled out, gasping for oxygen, just seconds before the barn blew up. Sarah died instantly in the explosion and her body was recovered the following day. Andy's daughter Sarah was named in her honour.

The comune extends from the Santa Lucerna mountains to the Savuto river valley to the south. History It is likely that Grimaldi owes its origins to the devastation experienced by the ancient territory of Pandosia, after the year 475 CE.Comunit√† Montana del Savuto The first settlement in the area may have been a small casale (hamlet) named Santa Caterina, around the year 872, when much of Calabria was experiencing the battles between the Lombards, the Byzantines and the Saracens. Other casali appeared, such as those at San Pietro and San Stefano. According to some scholars, the name Grimaldi evolved from Grimoald I, duke of Benevento and king of the Lombards, whose domains included Apulia, Calabria, and Ancona. The name was originally applied to the entire territory. Saccomanno, Storia di Grimaldi Thus, while there is no certainty that the Lombards founded the city, there is no doubt that they were present and had integrated into the population, well before their defeat at the start of the 11th century. The present-day town may have been founded between 1027 and 1034, in the aftermath of the Norman invasion, when due to natural calamities and pestilence all of the Grimaldesi moved to the slopes of the Santa Lucerna mountains. During the period of Angevin, Aragonese and Spanish rule of the Kingdom of Naples, Grimaldi found itself in isolation, the main routes from Cosenza to Aiello being along the Savuto river to the south (then navigable). In 1369, Joan I of Naples sent a royal delegation to nearby Tinisi to divide the territories of Grimaldo and Mendicino from the territory of Aiello.http://digilander.libero.it/grimaldi1/grimaldi-0.htm Franco Vercillo, Grimaldi From this time, until 1510, there were a series of disputes and battles between the casale di Grimaldo and the count of Ajello, Francesco Siscar, who had intentions of occupying Grimaldi. In 1481, Paolo Siscar, count of Cirella, became the lord of Grimaldo, but the Grimaudisi avoided feudal obligations by paying 1000 ducati.http://digilander.libero.it/grimaldi1 Franco Vercillo, Grimaldi In 1638, the original Grimaldo was destroyed by an earthquake, and the town was rebuilt in an area known as \\"Chiata\\" (from where the district 'mpedichiati developed, meaning literally \\"at Chiata's feet\\"). In 1639 the rebuilding of the original Grimaldi began (vecchio Grimaldo). As with most towns in Southern Italy, Grimaldi contributed significantly to the Italian diaspora of the late 19th and early to mid- 20th centuries. The most recent wave of migrants, from the post-war years to the early 1970s, saw residents migrate to northern and central Italy, and many immigrated abroad, primarily to the United States, Canada, Germany and Belgium. In Canada, there is a large population of descendants from Grimaldi in London, Ontario, Vancouver, Burnaby, Edmonton, Kamloops, Trail, Toronto and Thunder Bay, Ontario.John Potestio, In Search of a Better Life: Emigration to Thunder Bay from a Small Town in Calabria (2000) Demographics In 1991 Grimaldi's population was 2,055 residents; however, in 2001 this figure dropped to 1,870, showing a decline in the decade 1991 - 2001 of -9.00%. At its peak census figure, in 1951, Grimaldi had a population of 3,786.ISTAT The residents are distributed amongst 714 households, with an average of 2.62 persons per household.

In 2005, Fonti revealed the conspiracy in the news magazine L'espresso.

Former employees of Enea are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s.

Gangster James Colosimo was born here in 1878.  History  The region is presented as a set of eleven small villages, including the capital, established in the 17th century. The etymology is related to the Colosimo surname, which is widespread in the area. Colosimi is potentially Greek in origin, being formed from the words 'colosi' (more correctly spelt as 'colossi' and being the plural of \\"colossus\\") and 'mi' (meaning 'me'). It is believed that until the early decades of the 7th century Colosimi was inhabited only in summer and that the first permanent inhabitants suffered disasters in the 17th century, such as famines and earthquakes. An especially the large earthquake occurred on 27 March 1638. The first Colosimi administrative autonomy (1811) was related to the political strength of the city-owned University of Scigliano. Until 1820, the municipality of Colosimi belonged as a territory of the town of Bianchi, Calabria. It became autonomous in that year. In 1813, Colosimi became home to the oldest Masonic Workshop, namely the Mamertini lodge, which, together with the Ginnosofisti silani di Carlopoli and the La Sila di Decollatura, can be called the cultural forges of these upland moors in the nineteenth century.

It is located on the hills facing the Aeolian Islands, and the river Savuto. The town is situated at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level at the feet of Mount St. Angelo, a few kilometers from the Tyrrhenian Sea and not far from the Lamezia Terme International Airport. The hillside location means that the climate is very dry with hot summers and mild winters. The flora is typical of the Mediterranean area, with numerous olive trees and, in the area of the river Savuto, oranges and lemons. The oil production is one of the mainstays of the local economy, as well as tourism and agriculture in general. The mediterranean weather also allows to grow different vegetables and fruits like tomato, zucchini, eggplant, pear, peach, prickly pear cactus and potato. There are also many typical dishes and products. The fauna of the area includes a number of species of birds of prey, foxes, wild boar and, in the mountains, wolves.  History  The town was known in Roman times as Sabutus, and was located not far from either the ancient cities of Terina or Temesa. During the Norman rule it was known as Pietramala, becoming Cleto in 1862. In the Angevin period Petramala it was part of the Ajello county, together with other estates and castles.  Main sights  The castle was built by the Normans at the top of Monte Sant'Angelo, overlooking the valley to the sea.

History Imhotep Museum, statue of a scribe, 5th Dynasty The museum, which was named for the ancient Egyptian architect Imhotep, was opened on April 26, 2006 by Suzanne Mubarak and Bernadette Chirac. Imhotep is credited with being the first Egyptian to build a monumental structure out of stone: Pharaoh Djoser's step pyramid located at Saqqara, which was built during the 3rd Dynasty. Constructed as part of the strategic site management program of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, the air-conditioned Imhotep Museum provides a more secure storage space than the traditional storehouses located at archaeological sites. In the museum, artefacts are more easily protected from theft, and they are stored in climate-controlled conditions. The site museum project at Saqqara was conceived of in 1990, but it was not launched until 1997 after the authorities had identified a suitable location on the plateau where the museum could sit unobtrusively and not disturb the natural landscape. Construction was completed in 2003. Museum contents The museum has six large halls in which one may admire masterpieces from Saqqara, such as a Ptolemaic mummy discovered by Zahi Hawass during the excavation of the Pyramid of Teti complex and a large double statue that was found near the causeway of the Unas complex. The statue depicts the 19th Dynasty High Priest of Mut, Amenemopet, and his wife. In the entrance hall, the visitor is welcomed by a fragment of the Djoser statue on which one can read the name of the king and the architect Imhotep. This find was on loan from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and was exhibited only in the museum's opening months. The second hall displays archaeological finds from various excavations on the Saqqara plateau. The artefacts in this exhibit will be rotated. The third hall is devoted Egyptian art, and contains vessels, statues, and stelae made of wood and stone, as well as the ancient tools used to build the monuments. The fourth hall exhibits architectural elements from the Step Pyramid complex, such as columns and the green and blue faience wall tiles that decorate chambers under the pyramid complex. A small statue of Imhotep is also found in this room. The fifth hall displays objects used in burials from the 6th Dynasty through the New Kingdom. A gallery dedicated to the French Egyptologist, Jean-Philippe Lauer, displays some of his personal effects and photographs of him at work on the plateau. Lauer began working at the Djoser complex in the 1920s and continued to work there for the remainder of his career, some 75 years.

A promising young lawyer, Broadstreet joined the staff of Governor-General Lord Salisbury in 1889. He later served as Canada's first justice of the peace. Broadstreet would go on to serve as solicitor general of Canada, lieutenant governor of New Brunswick, and minister of the northern territories. Carvell was born in Woodstock, New Brunswick. His father was a farmer descended from United Empire Loyalists and his mother was an Ulster Protestant. He was educated locally and worked as a teacher. In 1890 he earned his law degree from Boston University and returned to Woodstock to practice law. He was elected to the county council and became involved in business with stock in the Woodstock Power Company and the Carleton Electric Company. He purchased the Carleton Sentinel, a Liberal newspaper and was also the main shareholder for a time of the Carleton Observer. In 1899 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick but resigned a year later to contest the federal seat of Carleton but lost by 255 votes to Conservative Frederick Harding Hale, a lumber merchant. He won the seat on his next attempt and was the Liberal member of the House of Commons of Canada for the New Brunswick riding from 1904 until 1917. He was a minor backbencher in the Liberal caucus and was passed over for appointment to Sir Wilfrid Laurier's Cabinet in favour of William Pugsley when a New Brunswick seat at the Cabinet table opened up due to the resignation of Henry Emmerson. Carvell was offered a seat on the Supreme Court of New Brunswick in 1909 but turned it down. The Liberal government was defeated in the 1911 federal election and Carvell moved to the Opposition bench where he became prominent as a critic of Sam Hughes, Borden's Militia Minister. He also became active in provincial politics, joining party organizers Peter Veniot and Edward S. Carter as leading members of a powerful group of back-room Liberals known as the \\"Dark Lantern Brigade\\" who accused the provincial Conservative government of James Kidd Flemming of receiving kickbacks from the timber industry.Government of New Brunswick biographies of Premiers The New Brunswick Liberal Association offered Carvell the leadership of the provincial party but he declined at Laurier's urging. Despite his criticism of the Borden government's prosecution of the war as well as its nationalization of Canadian Northern Railway, Carvell broke with Laurier over the issue of conscription opposing Laurier's call for a referendum on the question. Carvell was approached by Borden to cross the floor during the Conscription Crisis and join his government but Carvell initially refused only to change his mind and join the government of Sir Robert Borden on October 17, 1917 as Minister of Public Works in the new Union government. He was re-elected in the 1917 federal election as a Liberal-Unionist MP for Victoria‚ÄîCarleton by acclamation. Following the war Carvell wished to rejoin the Liberals but was rejected by his former party. Instead, he retired from politics in 1919 upon being appointed Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners.History of Federal Ridings since 1867: Victoria-Carleton Further reading * Arthur T.

After travelling through Europe extensively with her father during her teenage years, she started writing the poem in London in 1904 and re-wrote it several times before her return to Sydney. The poem was first published in The Spectator in London on 5 September 1908 under the title \\"Core of My Heart\\".The Spectator (London), 5 September 1908, p. 329 (17th page of that day's issue) It was reprinted in many Australian newspapers, such as The Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser, who described the 'little poem' as striking the right note of \\"...the clear, ringing, triumphant note of love and trust in [Australia].\\" The poem quickly became well known and established Mackellar as a poet. Mackellar's family owned substantial properties in the Gunnedah district of New South Wales and a property (Torryburn) in the Paterson district of the Hunter Region. The poem is believed to have been directly inspired by witnessing the breaking of a drought when she was at Torryburn; \\"My Country\\" uses imagery to describe the land after the breaking of a long drought. Of ragged mountain ranges possibly refers to the Mount Royal Ranges, and the Barrington Tops. To many Australians the poem is an overtly romanticised version of \\"The Australian condition\\", as Mackellar's family were of considerable fortune and social favour. The poem reflects the romanticised and somewhat idealised reflection of a writer yearning to be taken back to Gunnedah. The first stanza, lesser-known, refers to England, and the fact that the vast majority of Australians of that era were of British birth or ancestry. The second stanza describes Australia and is amongst the best-known pieces of Australian poetry. In an interview in 1967, Mackellar described her reasons for writing the poem. MacKellar's first anthology of poems, The Closed Door, published in Australia in 1911, included the poem. The last line of the third stanza, \\"And ferns the warm dark soil\\" was originally \\"And ferns the crimson soil\\". Her second anthology, The Witch Maid & Other Verses, published in 1914, included the original version. A recording of \\"My Country\\" made by the radio and TV actor Leonard Teale became so popular in the 1970s that his reading of the first lines of the second stanza were often used to parody him.

He played as a flanker. He was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1959. He is considered one of the best French rugby players of all time and was inducted into both the International Rugby Hall of Fame and IRB Hall of Fame, in 2001 and 2011 respectively. His younger brother also appeared for France, with the pair appearing together at international level on a number of occasions. Career Prat was born in Lourdes, Midi-Pyr√©n√©es.

He won 6 titles of the French Championship, in 1947/48, 1951/52, 1952/53, 1955/56, 1956/57 and 1957/58, two titles of the Coupe de France, in 1950 and 1951, and three titles of the Challenge Yves du Manoir, in 1953, 1954 and 1956. He had 51 caps for France, from 1945 to 1955, scoring 9 tries, 27 conversions, 15 penalties and 6 drop goals, 144 points on aggregate. He won his first cap for France in a 21-9 win over the British Army at the Parc des Princes, in Paris, in 1 January 1945. Prat kicked two conversions that helped France to win the game. Prat then played for France in matches against a British Empire XV, a non-capped Wales XV and a 'Kiwis' team. Prat then played in the 1947 Five Nations Championship. After playing in the first match of the subsequent Five Nations, he played in a Test against Australia, which France won by 13-6. Prat then played in the rest of the Five Nations Championship.

Prat played in the 1950, 1951 and 1952 Five Nations, and then played in a match against a touring Springboks team, which South Africa won 25-3. He ran on for his first match as captain of France in the opening match of the 1954 Five Nations against Scotland. One of his most famous moments came in 1954 when Prat scored a barn- storming try against the All Blacks, which saw France win the match 3-0. He continued to captain France to their first ever Five Nations victory, sharing the championship with Wales and England. He won the 1952 Rugby Union European Cup and the 1954 Rugby Union European Cup, the second time as the captain of the French side. His final season of Test rugby was in 1955. He played his final Five Nations match against Wales during the Five Nations at Stade Colombes in Paris. Having previously defeated England, Ireland and Scotland in the tournament, a win over the Welsh would have seen France capture their first Grand Slam and outright championship. He played his last match in the 40-0 win against Italy, in Grenoble, at 10 April 1955, in a tour.

This railway was opened to Te Kuha from Westport in 1912, but a connection through the Buller Gorge to connect with the railway in Inangahua Junction was not completed until 1942. Passenger services no longer pass through Te Kuha and the railway mainly transports coal to the east coast port of Lyttelton. There is not much evidence that the village at Te Kuha even existed now in 2006. The road ends as the railway enters the Buller Gorge, and the surrounding flats are used for farming. There are no building remains, and further access on the railway side of the Buller river is discouraged by the railway activity. Although this point was the punt crossing in the early days for the road on the south bank at Windy Point, the building of the black bridge across the Buller spelt the death knell of Te Kuha.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021 categorized it as a national reliever facility for Tampa International Airport. The airport has a Class 1 Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 139 operating certificate allowing passenger airline flights. Annually, around March‚ÄìApril, the airport hosts the Sun 'n Fun International Fly-In and Expo, a six-day fly-in, airshow and aviation convention. It is the second largest such event in the United States after the Experimental Aircraft Association's (EAA) annual \\"AirVenture\\" event each summer at Wittman Regional Airport (OSH) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. During the week of Sun 'n Fun, Lakeland Linder International Airport becomes the world's busiest airport with 60,000+ aircraft movements. History : For the World War II use of the airport, see Lakeland Army Airfield : For the original Lakeland Municipal Airport, see Lodwick Field In 1940 the Lakeland City Commission passed a resolution to replace the city's Lakeland Municipal Airport, which was built in 1933 & early 1934. The new airport, tentatively named Lakeland Municipal Airport No. 2 was named Drane Field in honor of Herbert J. Drane, one of Lakeland's outstanding citizens. The city had barely begun work on the new airport when, with the war already raging in Europe, it leased the facility to the War Department. The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers improved the three existing runways and built a training facility for bombers and fighters. The new base, initially a sub-base of MacDill Field in Tampa, was named Lakeland Army Air Field, but was still known as Drane Field. Thousands of U.S. Army Air Forces pilots, navigators, bombardiers and flight crew received part of their advanced flight training at Lakeland during World War II, primarily in the B-26 Marauder. After the war ended, the Army Airfield was left unused due to the size of the facility far exceeding the needs of the city as well as the costs involved of converting it to civil use. By the 1950s Lakeland Municipal Airport (renamed Al Lodwick Field in 1948) was dwindling due to the closure of Lodwick Aircraft which was the airport's primary tenant. With the closure of Lodwick Aircraft, the city decided to phase out Lodwick Field as a municipal airport in the summer of 1957 and concentrate its resources on Drane Field in south Lakeland. Drane Field had deteriorated and languished underutilized for many years following the departure of the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1945. After several years of new construction and conversion to a civil airport, it was rededicated as Lakeland Municipal Airport in 1960 with Don Emerson as its first director. In the 1970s the facility was renamed Lakeland Regional Airport; in the late 1980s it was again renamed as Lakeland Linder Regional Airport for local businessman Paul Scott Linder. Linder had founded Lakeland-based Linder Industrial Machinery, a multimillion-dollar heavy construction machinery company, in 1953. The Chairman of the Lakeland Economic Development Council, Linder was also director of the Florida Council of 100, the Florida Chamber of Commerce and the Florida Council of Economic Education. He was named Florida‚Äôs Free Enterpriser of the Year in 1988, received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Florida, and was named 1989 Florida Entrepreneur of the Year. Paul Scott Linder died on November 11, 1990. In November 2017 Lakeland Linder International Airport opened their first U.S. Customs and Border Protection General Aviation Facility allowing international aircraft with 20 passengers or less to land at the field with an approved overflight permit. In 2017 the airport had 129,504 aircraft operations, averaging 355 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% military, 1% air taxi, and <1% airline. In August 2018, 248 were aircraft based at the airport: 161 single-engine, 35 multi-engine, 42 jet, 9 helicopter, and 1 glider.  Commercial air service  Draken Ramp at LAL With the impending closure of Lodwick Field, National Airlines moved their Lodestars to Drane Field in 1947; the airline left the airport in 1962. During the 1960s and into the early 1970s, prior to airline deregulation, airline service was provided by Allegheny Commuter and the former Sun Airlines. From 2006 to 2008 the airport had limited air service under FAR Part 135 (AirTaxi) provided by DayJet utilizing Eclipse 500 very light jet (VLJ) aircraft. DayJet also maintained a \\"DayPort\\" facility in the airport's main terminal building. However, DayJet ceased operations in September 2008 and subsequently declared bankruptcy. Scheduled airline flights returned to the airport in June 2011, when Direct Air flying Boeing 737s began service to Myrtle Beach, SC; Niagara Falls, NY, and Springfield, IL. Service ended on March 13, 2012, when Direct Air unexpectedly announced an end to operations. Direct Air was then subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012. On July 23, 2020, Amazon Air commenced operations following the opening of a brand new 285,000 square foot cargo processing facility.https://www.theledger.com/story/news/2020/07/23/amazon-air-arrives- at-lakeland-linder-with-1st-cargo-flight/112571136/ Cargo Airlines And Destinations= Federal government, corporate and business aviation  The airport hosts 84 businesses and organizations that employ over 1,450 people. Through the combination of aircraft operations and local businesses, the airport has an economic impact of over $284 Million (in 2012). The airport is currently embarking on a new economic impact study for 2017. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration‚Ä≤s (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) relocated to Lakeland from MacDill Air Force Base in June 2017. NOAA AOC is the headquarters for all nine research aircraft operated by NOAA including their world-famous NOAA Hurricane Hunters ( WP-3D Orion aircraft). In addition, a defense contractor, Draken International, is headquartered at the airport. Draken provides training support to the US Military with their fleet of privately owned tactical aircraft, which includes Douglas A-4 Skyhawk, Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, Aermacchi MB-339, Aero L-39 Albatros, and Dassault Mirage F1 aircraft.Draken International, Florida Trend magazine, July 2013 The airport is the home of the Black Diamond Jet Team, a civilian aerobatic demonstration team which flies four Aero L-39 Albatros high-performance trainers and one T-33.  Military  ARFF 1 and USN Blue Angel 7 sit in front of the terminal From the 1970s until 1999, the airfield was a joint civil- military facility when it hosted Army Aviation Support Facility #2 of the Florida Army National Guard, operating since-retired UH-1 Huey helicopters, followed by the locally based UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters of Detachment D, 171st Aviation Battalion (TA). The establishment of these units and aircraft in Lakeland was due primarily to the efforts of former U.S. Senator and later Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, a Lakeland native. In 2000, the Florida Army National Guard aviation units relocated to a new facility at Brooksville- Tampa Bay Regional Airport in Brooksville, Florida. Despite the military's departure from Lakeland Linder International Airport, Florida Army National Guard aircraft, as well as Air Force aircraft from MacDill AFB, Coast Guard aircraft from CGAS Clearwater, Army Reserve aircraft from the Army Aviation Support Facility at St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport, U.S. Navy aircraft from Pensacola and other transient military aircraft throughout the United States continue to use the airfield for practice approaches, landings and takeoffs. The airport's principal fixed-base operator (FBO) also continues to provide DoD contract jet fuel services for transient military aircraft.  Education  Postcard of the former Lakeland Municipal Airport No. 1 (Lodwick Field), showing school of aeronautics. LAL is host to Central Florida Aerospace Academy a public high school with over 250 students. The academy, part of the Polk County School Board, maintains four tracks, that students can follow throughout their high school career, including A&P;, Aerospace, Avionics, and Engineering. LAL also hosts the Lakeland Aero-Club which is the largest high school flying club in the nation. The club builds and restores vintage aircraft, promotes flight training to its members, and fly to Oshkosh, Wisconsin \\"Airventure\\" annually in all antique airplanes providing members with cross-country flight training. In addition, the airport hosts a college (Polk State College) and career college (Travis Technical College). Polk State has over 240 students between their four-degree programs(Aerospace Administration, Aerospace Sciences, Aviation Maintenance Administration, and Professional Pilot Science). PSC is the only public college offering bachelor's degrees in Aerospace in the state of Florida. While Travis Career Center allows students to obtain their A&P; license after high school. Facilities NOAA 42 and NOAA 49 inside NOAA's AOC at LAL The airport encompasses 1,710 acres (692 ha) at an elevation of 142 feet (43 m). It has two asphalt runways: 9/27 is 8,499 by 150 feet (2,590 x 46 m) and 5/23 is 5,005 by 150 feet (1,526 x 46 m). It has one turf runway: 8/26 which is 2205 by 60 feet (672 x 18 m) and requires prior permission to use. Over the years the airport has seen a number of layout modifications. An original northwest/southeast runway was converted to a taxiway to permit construction of the Publix supermarket chain's corporate aircraft facility on the northwest end, while Runway 9/27 was lengthened to in the late 1950s and then to in the late 1990s. Runway 9/27, its associated taxiway system and the current airport terminal ramp area can accommodate up to Boeing 747 and 777 aircraft. The Lakeland VORTAC is on the airfield and runways 9/27 and 5/23 have high- intensity runway lighting (HIRL) and P4L precision approach path indicator (PAPI) systems. Runway 9 is equipped with a Category I Instrument Landing System (ILS), and Medium Intensity Approach Light System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR). In addition, runways 5/23 and 27 have published non- precision approaches. The airport has been a tower-controlled airport since the 1970s and the FAA operates a Level I air traffic control tower under the FAA Contract Tower Program. The FAA also installed an Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) ground station at the airport. Emergency services are provided by the Lakeland Fire Department, which maintains a 24-hour manned station on the airfield with a specialized crash truck and crew providing aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) capability. The main terminal building contains the airport administrative offices, passenger processing area, passenger waiting areas, and an aviation-themed restaurant. A Hilton Hotels Corporation Hilton Garden Inn is located adjacent to the terminal. A Staybridge Suites extended stay hotel became the second hotel at the Lakeland Airport, opening in December 2017 and sitting on 2.18 acres next to the Hilton Garden Inn. This new lodging accommodates the expansion of nearby corporate parks, distribution centers, and the increasing capacity of the airport facilities. With a growing demand from international operators the airport began planning and design of a new U.S. Customs and Border Protection General Aviation Facility (User Fee Facility) in 2015. With the opening of its customs office in 2017, LAL is now capable of accepting an array of international flights.

He debuted on-screen on 21 November 2001. West left the series on 30 April 2003 upon departing for two years, but made reappearances before departing on 31 October 2003. He returned on 23 September 2005. He was later accidentally murdered in 2006; he made his final on-screen appearance on 16 May 2006. Character development In September 2001, actor Daniel Collopy successfully auditioned for the role of Josh and moved from Melbourne to Sydney to begin filming. Josh was introduced as the serial new trainee lifeguard and a potential new love interest for established character Dani Sutherland (Tammin Sursok). Josh was Collopy's first regular television role and he felt it was a \\"fantastic opportunity\\" to work on Home and Away. Network Seven describe Josh as being part of a \\"high- society family\\" and initially being \\"about as laid-back as they come\\". Josh likes \\"learning and broadening his mind\\" and has a passion for surfing. Josh's \\"tall, dark and handsome\\" appearance has made him popular with the female characters. They also said that Summer Bay lifestyle suited Josh in his early appearances. Collopy said there were no similarities between himself and Josh. Josh and Dani's relationship is problematic and leads a brief separation. They eventually reconcile following more arguments. Sursok told a reporter from Inside Soap that \\"their relationship has come down to silly mind games and petty arguments, they've come through so many problems and dramas that instead of really being there for each other and appreciating what they have, they've lost sight of why they are together in the first place.\\" Hayley Smith (Rebecca Cartwright) makes Dani see that they should not be arguing. Dani realises that the arguments are meaningless and the pair sort out their differences. Collopy was written out of the serial when Josh is murdered in a whodunit storyline. The serial's producers wanted to capitalise on the success of their stalker storyline, which pulled in high viewing figures, by creating a new mystery plot. One suspect is Amanda Vale (Holly Brisley). While interviewed by a reporter from Inside Soap, Brisley admitted that even she did not know who the killer was. She said that \\"it will be a real shock when the truth comes out\\". It was later revealed that Barry Hyde (Ivar Kants) shot Josh by accident. Storylines Josh arrives in Summer Bay in late 2001 while on Schoolies and begins hanging around with Kirsty Sutherland (Christie Hayes) who lets him and his friends come back to her home at the Summer Bay caravan park and have a party while her parents Rhys (Michael Beckley) and Shelley (Paula Forrest) are away. They wreck the house and scramble to put it back in order before Rhys and Shelley return. When Rhys sits on a chair and falls through, he throws Josh and his friends out. Josh then sets his sights on Kirsty's sister, Dani who rejects his advances at first but they later began dating. Josh quickly finds employment as a lifeguard at the Surf Club, taking over from Vinnie Patterson (Ryan Kwanten), who has recently taken paternity leave. This arrangement becomes permanent when Vinnie is sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for fraud after being framed by his father, Ralph Patterson (Alan Cinis). After Josh receives his HSC results, he isn't phased despite scoring highly. He reluctantly agrees to attend University in the City as per his wealthy parents' wishes but decides to return to the Bay and continue being a lifeguard. Josh settles into the bay and begins befriending several local teens Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg), Noah Lawson (Beau Brady) and Hayley. When Josh wants to take his relationship with Dani a step further, she is reluctant as she was raped the previous year by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell). Kane's presence in the bay angers Josh, which puts a strain on their relationship. Josh also becomes privy to the fact that Kane is dating Kirsty. After a difficult time, Josh and Dani finally become intimate on the beach one night. Dani later moves in with Josh, Noah and Hayley to an apartment the four dub \\"The Palace\\". Josh's mother, Jackie (Julieanne Newbould), arrives in the bay and she pens an article that could potentially ruin local doctor and counsellor Flynn Saunders (Martin Dingle-Wall). Josh manages to talk her out of writing the article, and Flynn's reputation is saved. Josh faces his biggest test as a lifeguard when local doctor Charlotte Adams (Stephanie Jacobsen) goes for a final swim before leaving to work in an orphanage in Vietnam. Charlotte nearly drowns but is resuscitated by Josh. Unfortunately, Charlotte in hospital dies of complications a week later and Josh blames himself and decides to change career track. When Josh shares a kiss with Hayley, shortly after his breakup with Dani. Noah is incensed with rage and Josh moves out of the palace and into the flat above the Diner. Josh and Hayley date for a while but Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher), who is suffering a brain tumour, sees visions of an unhappy future for the couple. Hayley eventually breaks up with Josh. After being one of many suspects in the frame for the murder of Angie Russell (Laurie Foell), Josh discovers his father, Greg (Dane Carson) is ill and leaves to take over his business. Later in the year Josh makes several sporadic returns, including making plans to destroy and develop the drop in centre, destroying Colleen Smart's (Lyn Collingwood) mobile home, firing Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) from the Surf Club Gym. During one of Josh's visits, he learns Dani is to stand trial after running Kane down with her car and Josh is later subpoenaed to be a witness for the prosecution. He gives evidence against Dani and leans on Kirsty to sell her story about her romance with Kane to him so he can have it published in Jackie's paper. He causes further irritation when he tries to manipulate Tasha Andrews (Isabel Lucas). Having made too many enemies, Josh leaves town and nothing is heard of him for two years. In 2005, Josh returns to town and runs for Mayor which doesn't sit well with Alf, who is also running. Josh later wins the election and proceeds with Project 56, a controversial project involving the construction of a traffic bridge connecting two ends of the bay together with which he enlists the help of Amanda. Alf's sister, Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) is keen to bring Josh down and a battle soon ensues. In 2006, however, Morag is eventually forced to back off after Josh nearly kills her in an attempt to stop Morag revealing the true intentions of Project 56. Josh's reign also sees he death of Amanda's husband Graham after he uncovers the truth about the project. Josh then makes several enemies after framing Alf for money embezzlement, resulting in him being imprisoned. By the time Amanda realizes Josh's true colours, it too late and Josh attempts to kill her. Josh allows Tasha to be held prisoner by the Believers religious group and also begins threatening Alf's grandson Ric Dalby (Mark Furze), who resorts to violence against Josh, and Robbie Hunter (Jason Smith), who also tries to kill Josh but backs out. Josh later tries discrediting the police by attempting to expose the fact that they know the Summer Bay Stalker has returned. Unfortunately, despite the number of people against Josh, nobody is able to prevent Project 56 from going ahead until Josh is found dead one morning in his council office. The police lead one investigation and Morag begins her own. The two investigations reach a climax, resulting in Josh's killer narrowly escaping them. But weeks after, Barry later confesses to Morag he accidentally killed Josh, who had stolen documents from Morag's office and learnt that Barry had killed his own wife to protect his son. Josh had threatened to call the police and threatened Barry with a gun. Barry made a grab for the weapon and, during the struggle between the two, the gun went off and Josh was killed. Reception For his portrayal of Josh, Collopy was nominated for the \\"Most Popular New Male Talent\\" Logie Award in 2003. Collopy was nominated for \\"Best Bad Boy\\" at the 2006 Inside Soap Awards. Michael Idato of the said that Josh was the \\"new hottie\\" in Summer Bay and credited Josh's on-screen romance as transforming Collopy into the \\"No 1. TV Week coverboy\\". Channel 5 said that Josh was a \\"good boy gone bad\\" and was not short of enemies. They opined that using Amanda to scam Graham was a memorable storyline and said that his murder was karma. When Josh returned to the serial with his money making scam, a writer from the Liverpool Echo said that it \\"looks set to make him unpopular with the residents\\". They added that \\"true to form\\" it was not long before he was \\"the arch-villain of Summer Bay\\".

Courtyard of the friary. The Sacro Convento is a Franciscan friary in Assisi, Umbria, Italy. The friary is connected as part of three buildings to the upper and lower church of the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi, where the friars custody with great reverence the body of Saint Francis. St. Francis wanted to be buried at this location outside of Assisi's city walls, called Hill of Hell (Collo d'Inferno - here were the gallows where criminals were put to death), because his master Jesus of Nazareth also was killed like a criminal outside of the city of Jerusalem. Description The Conventual Franciscans consider Assisi as the mother town and the monastery as spiritual centre of their order, while the operational centre is located in Rome. Pope Gregory IX laid the cornerstone for the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi and the friary on 17 July 1228, the day after the canonization of Saint Francis. In 1230, after two years the lower church was ready to uptake the bones of Saint Francis, who had died at Portiuncula in 1226, and had been transferred to the church San Gregorio, which later became the Basilica di Santa Chiara, after Santa Chiara's death. Grave of Saint Francis in the Crypt of the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi. Historians generally agree that the complex with church and monastery was completed with 11 years, by 1239. The original part of the Sacro Convento (built under the leadership of Brother Elias) consisted of a refectory, dormitory, chapter hall, papal hall and a scriptorium-library. For the first 200 years of its existence, the library rivaled the Sorbonne and Avignon with a comparable number of manuscripts. In the 15th century, during the reign of Pope Sixtus IV, the Sacro Convento was extensively enlarged and used as a summer residence of the popes. In the 17th century, the kings of Spain endowed the Sacro Convento with a larger hospice so that the friars could better provide for the many infirm pilgrims. In 1971, a theological institute accredited by the Lateran was established to meet the academic needs of international students from all three branches of the First Order, the TOR's, several Franciscan sister communities and the Benedictines. It also became the theological training centre for diocesan seminarians, as well as for lay women and men seeking advanced degrees in Religious Studies.

He obtained a confirmation of the family baronetcy in 1678, and served as a Member of Parliament for two boroughs in Devon in 1679 and from 1685 to 1687. Never very active in national politics, he was one of the many Tories estranged by James II's pro-Catholicism, but remained a Tory after the Glorious Revolution. He continued to hold local office in Devon off and on until his death in 1714, when he was succeeded by his grandson. Career He was a younger son of Sir John Acland, 1st Baronet and his wife Elizabeth. He matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford on 27 November 1652 and received his B.A. on 22 June 1655. He was appointed a justice of the peace for Devon in 1670, and in 1672, he succeeded his nephew Arthur as baronet and inherited an estate worth ¬£2,000 per year. In 1673, he was appointed a commissioner for assessment in Devon, and unsuccessfully contested a by-election at Tiverton following the death of Sir Thomas Carew, 1st Baronet. He was appointed to the commission on recusants in 1675 and made a freeman of Exeter; in 1676, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of the county. The family baronetcy was of somewhat uncertain status; the letters patent to his father were either lost during the confusion of the English Civil War or never passed the seals. Sir Hugh's predecessors in the baronetcy had generally died in their minorities and had not pursued the claim. Hugh obtained new letters patent dated 21 January 1678 which confirmed the original grant and granted precedence to the baronetcy of the original date of issue, 24 June 1644. Acland again stood for Parliament for Barnstaple in the spring 1679 election and was successfully returned. He was not an active member and, though thought to be a Court supporter, was absent from the division on the exclusion bill. He did not stand again in the fall 1679 election. In 1680, he left the Devon committee for assessment; he was already a colonel of militia foot by this time. He stood for Devon in the 1681 election but was defeated. Appointed a justice of the peace and an alderman for Tiverton in 1683, he was returned to Parliament for that constituency as a Tory in 1685, and elected mayor of the town the following year. He was also appointed a JP for South Molton in 1684. After the collapse of the Monmouth Rebellion, he was appointed a commissioner for rebels' estates. Once again, he was largely inactive in Parliament, serving on the committee to prevent the export of wool. In 1687, the Tiverton corporation was remodelled by quo warranto proceedings and he was removed from his offices there. In July 1688 he joined with many of the Devonshire gentry in repeating the temporizing answer given by Sir Edward Seymour to the \\"Three Questions\\" of James II, and was consequently dismissed from his county offices. Acland was reappointed a JP for Devon in October 1688 and served on the commission for assessment again from 1689 to 1690. He was High Sheriff of Devon in 1690. He refused to sign the Association in 1696 and was removed from the bench at this time. Reappointed in 1700, he apparently refused a deputy lieutenancy in 1701 due to a quarrel with Sir Edward Seymour. Off the bench again in 1702, he was appointed to the deputy lieutenancy again in 1703 and a JP for the third time in about 1704. He continued to serve in these posts throughout the reign of Queen Anne, and died on 9 March 1714. Family He married Anne, daughter of Sir Thomas Daniel of Beswick Hall, Yorkshire, on 19 March 1674 and had seven children: *John Acland (c.1674‚Äì1703) *Hugh Acland *Rev. Thomas Acland (d. 11 September 1735), rector of South Brent and prebendary of Exeter, married Catherine Wilcocks on 12 February 1712 and had issue *Arthur Daniel Acland (d. 1690/1), died without issue *Charles Acland (d. 1713) *Francis Acland (d. 1719), a merchant in Coimbra, died without issue *Elizabeth Acland (d. 1694) On his death in 1714 he was succeeded in the baronetcy by his grandson, his eldest son John having predeceased him.

Orphaned at an early age, he was taken in by his uncle in Paris, Israel Henriet, an etcher and print-seller, and friend of Jacques Callot. Between 1630 and 1650 Silvestre travelled widely in France, Spain and Italy, which he visited three times, and later worked up his sketches as etchings, which were sold singly and in series. His work, especially of Venetian subjects published in the 1660s, influenced eighteenth-century painters of vedute such as Luca Carlevaris and Canaletto, who adapted his compositions. In 1661 he inherited the stock of plates of his uncle, the printseller Israel Henriet, among which was a large part of the works of Callot, and many of those of Stefano della Bella. In 1662 he was appointed dessinateur et graveur du Roi and in 1673 he was appointed drawing-master to Louis, le Grand Dauphin. From 1668 he was granted workshop space in the galleries of the Louvre, where the practice of housing eminent artists and craftsmen was a tradition that was originated under Henri IV. Silvestre's atelier was large: he had at least two pupils who had separate careers as engravers, Fran√ßois Noblesse and Meunier. In 1670 Charles Le BrunLe Brun painted portraits of Israel Silvestre and his wife. recommended him for membership in the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. In 1675 his son, the artist Louis de Silvestre, was born at Sceaux. At his death he left a large collection of drawings, more than a thousand engravings, and other works of art to his sons, whose own artistic tastes he had nurtured. The family collection was sold at auction in 1810.

The character made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 January 1988. Clarke quit the role in 1989 and the character was written out. In August 2010, it was announced that Roo would return to Home and Away with Georgie Parker in the role. The character returned on 29 October 2010. Casting In 1987, Clarke auditioned for the roles of Carly Morris, Lynn Davenport and Bobby Simpson; but was unsuccessful each time. After the series had finished filming their pilot episode, producers changed their minds and invited Clarke to audition for the role of Roo, which she won. Clarke told a reporter from TV Life that she was \\"really pleased\\" because she thought Roo was a \\"great character\\". Character development=Characterisation Roo's personality gained an unwelcome reception amongst viewers. Clarke said that \\"everyone\\" hated Roo and revealed that people would \\"boo\\" at her while attending promotional appearances.Kesta 1990, p.47. On one occasion Clarke had to leave a shopping centre because females were shouting \\"slut\\" at her.Oram 1990, p.64. Clarke said that Roo is \\"a cow\\" but defended her because Roo ultimately ends up suffering.Kesta 1990, p.55. Teenage pregnancy In the serial's first season, Alan Bateman wanted Home and Away to tackle serious social issues and a few months later Roo became the first character to have a teenage pregnancy.Mercado 2004, p.253. The production team felt that Roo's pregnancy was \\"risque\\" because Home and Away was aired in an early evening time-slot. Clarke said she did not know what it was like to be pregnant and had to carry out research. While filming the storyline, Clarke was required to wear a bag filled with lentils beneath her clothing. This was to give the impression that Roo was pregnant, and as her pregnancy progressed more lentils were added to the bag to maintain continuity. Clarke remained unaware of how to portray a convincing birth scene. The wife of the episode's director had previously given birth during a complicated labour. She helped Clarke with her research, which also included watching child birth videos. Clarke said that while she had learned most aspects of labour, not experiencing the actual pain of birth resulted in her feeling unprepared for the scenes. The birth scenes were filmed over the period of one day, consisting of more than fifteen shoots. Clarke said the dramatic breathing left her \\"dizzy\\" and even caused her to hyperventilate.Kesta 1990, p.25. Departure and return Clarke played the role of Roo from 1988, until the character was written out a year later after Clarke quit the show. Clarke has been asked to return to the show and reprise her role as Roo many times, but she has never agreed. In August 2010, it was announced that Roo would be returning to Home and Away. Producers decided to recast the role after Clarke became busy with other television shows and her career as a children's singer. Former All Saints actress, Georgie Parker was given the role and she began filming her first scenes in the same month. Of her casting, Parker said \\"I'm thrilled to be back at Channel Seven and to be part of Home and Away. Working with Ray is a joy. We are having a fantastic time together. The whole cast and crew have been wonderful\\". Of the decision to bring the character back, series producer Cameron Welsh said \\"We had such a positive reaction to Emily Symons's return as Marilyn; we trust the fans will love having an original character such as Roo back in the Bay. Securing Georgie Parker to bring her back to our screens is a real coup for the show\\". Parker called her \\"a colourful character who has a strong history with the origin of the show\\". Parker has said the grown up Roo is very different from the teenager. She said \\"She was a colourful character when she left. She lost her mother when she was very young, and I think that when girls lose their mothers, they can go off the rails - and that's exactly what Roo did\\". Parker added that she gets to play the adult who may have learned from past mistakes. During an interview, Meagher said the adult Roo is \\"still full of energy, bluff and bravado. She's had a few financial problems and is possibly running away from a bloke.\\" He added that Alf has trouble getting her to tell him the truth, but he is \\"pleased to see her back in the Bay.\\" Meningitis In July 2014, the character was diagnosed with meningitis. After returning from an extended trip to Las Vegas to look after her injured aunt Colleen Smart (Lyn Collingwood), Roo was very secretive about her times away. Within a day, Roo started showing symptoms of an illness. Parker explained \\"This illness hits her fast and hard. She's lethargic, but thinks it's just jetlag. She also has a splitting headache that affects her eyes, and she's low on energy. It's all very out of character.\\" Roo's decision to keep quiet about her trip meant that nobody had any idea what was wrong with her. Roo fell unconscious at home and the situation became very serious. Roo was eventually diagnosed with meningitis. Her condition later took a turn for the worse and she suffered a seizure. In order to treat her, the doctors needed to know about her trip and her foster-daughter Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi) found her passport, which revealed that she had been to Peru. With the information, the doctors were able to treat Roo and save her life. Storylines=1988‚Äì89 Roo begins to resent her father's relationship with Ailsa Hogan (Judy Nunn) out of loyalty to her late mother, Martha (Alison Mulvaney). Roo begins dating Frank Morgan (Alex Papps) and they start a band with Lance Smart (Peter Vroom) and Martin Dibble (Craig Thompson). Roo's continued obsession with Ailsa drives a rift between her and Frank, despite nearly sleeping with him as an act of rebellion over Ailsa staying over. Roo contacts her aunt, Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances), who is a judge and asks her to do a background check on Ailsa. At Alf and Ailsa's engagement party, Roo reveals Ailsa went to prison for killing her abusive father. However, Ailsa's friends and Frank, side with her.

She refuses to let him back into her life, so Brett goes to Morag, who tries to talk Roo into changing her mind. In the middle of her wedding, she reveals that Frank is not the father of her baby. Frank drives off in anger and swerves off the road to avoid Bobby and the car falls into a ditch, almost killing him. The incident leaves Roo an outcast within the town. Morag tries to persuade her to move to the city with her, but Celia talks her out of it. Brett applies for custody, but Roo suggests they sort it out between themselves.

With Ailsa returning to town to be Christopher Fletcher's (Ashleigh Bell-Weir) godmother, Roo fakes stomach pains to stop Alf attending the christening. However, by hyperventilating she sends herself into premature labour and gives birth to a baby girl, who she names, Martha (Burcin Kapkin). She is pleased when Frank seems to take an interest, until she learns that he is dating Bobby. Brett tries to force Roo into giving him custody of Martha. He kidnaps the baby and Roo considered suicide, before she is informed that Brett had returned Martha. Roo refuses to press charges and the couple realise that they cannot raise Martha, so they give her up for adoption. Roo then begins to accept Ailsa, when she and Alf reconcile. Roo decides to take a break from the Bay and when she returns, she reveals that she has a new boyfriend, David Lee (Anthony Wong).

Frank and Bobby marry and Roo is stunned to learn Bobby is Morag's daughter and thus her cousin. Roo takes a job at the Macklin Corporation. Her manager, Nicholas Walsh (Robert Taylor), sends nasty letters to Ailsa and frames Roo, with help from Morag. With Alf and Ailsa believing the letters are from her, Roo moves in with Celia and then with Morag. When Alf discovers the truth, he apologises and Roo moves back in. She then starts dating Simon Yates (Christopher Saunders). Ailsa becomes pregnant, which pleases Roo.

Roo finds herself working closely with Frank and when he is offered a promotion in the city, he celebrates by kissing Roo. She feels guilty about the kiss and when Frank goes to the city without Bobby, everyone assumes he and Roo had an affair. Roo is upset when Sally Fletcher (Katie Ritchie) blames her for the break-up. Bobby tells her that she and Frank would have broken up anyway and gives them her blessing. Roo then goes to the city to meet Frank and tells him she wants to give their relationship another go. Frank and Roo marry, but they split by the time Frank returns to town. Roo later moves to New York, where she is joined for a time by both Martha and Duncan.

Roo and Laura organise a ball at Sid's farm and Roo tries to make peace with Marilyn. Bianca is raped at the ball and Roo criticises Laura for selling tickets to the River Boys.

Roo and Marilyn eventually become friends again and Roo breaks up with Sid when she realises his family will always be a priority over her. Roo takes over the running of the Diner due to staff shortages and she starts dating Harvey Ryan (Marcus Graham), despite being warned not to by Romeo, Indi and Sid. Roo and Harvey break up when she learns he sabotaged Alf's boat. Roo is disgusted when Harvey tries to blackmail John and she persuades Alf to stand against him during the council elections.

They called Roo \\"evil\\" for trying to break up Alf's relationship with Ailsa, lying to and trying to marry Frank, leaving him at the altar and later having an affair with him. They added \\"If she hadn't already left town, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear that she was driving the speedboat that struck down Summer Bay's beloved butch Bobby and killed her. On the plus side, she does have the rather hilarious name of 'Roo'.\\" Andrew Mercado described Roo as Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) \\"Minxy teenage daughter\\" in his book, Super Aussie soaps: behind the scenes of Australia's best loved TV shows.Mercado 2004, p.254. A TV Week columnist describe Roo as \\"Summer Bay's original spoilt brat\\" who was never very far from drama. A Holy Soap writer stated that Roo's most memorable moment was \\"Bowling over her dad Alf by unexpectedly arriving back in Summer Bay after more than two decades away.\\" The Herald Sun said Roo is \\"Manipulative, mysterious and returned from living what she claims was the high life in New York\\", they predicted that her motives for returning to the Bay would puzzle viewers. When she slept with Miles, The Sun television magazine Buzz said: \\"Will she ever give up her wild-child way?\\" Laura Morgan writing for All About Soap hoped Roo would not steal Sid from Marilyn and said: \\"Keep your hands off that Sid, Roo!\\" ReferencesBibliography External links * Roo Stewart at the Official Home and Away website Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 1988 Fictional female businesspeople Fictional teenage parents Female characters in television Female villains ","title":"Roo Stewart"},{"id":"6293944","text":"Warren Martin (1916 - 1982) was an American composer of classical music.

Peter Beckx, S.J. Peter Jan Beckx (also Pieter Jan Beckx, in French Pierre Jean Beckx) (8 February 1795 - 4 March 1887) born in Zichem (Belgium) and died in Rome, was a Belgian Jesuit priest, elected the twenty-second Superior-General of the Society of Jesus in 1853. Early Years and Formation Beckx was born ‚Äî two months after the death of his father ‚Äî in a very poor family. Another brother and sister died before he was one year old. With the help of benefactors he did his schooling in Testelt and then the municipal school of Aarschot. In 1815 he entered the seminary of Mechelen in order to follow the course of studies leading to the priesthood. Ordained priest in Mechelen (6 March 1819) he was appointed in Uccle, a parish in the neighbourhood of Brussels (now part of the city). Eight months later, he resigned and entered the Society of Jesus at Hildesheim, Hanover. After the usual novitiate formation time he completed his Theological and Biblical studies (1823‚Äì26) in Germany. He was soon able to preach, hear confessions, and give retreats in the German language. Career The Duke and Duchess of Anhalt-K√∂then converted to Catholicism in 1825 and asked for a Jesuit chaplain. Beckx was appointed to this duty, and went to live in K√∂then. By giving classes to children in his own house, building a little church and organizing spiritual activities he brought many people back to the Catholic faith. After the death of the duke (1830) he went to live in Vienna in Austria, where he was the only Jesuit for many years. His powerful sermons gave him fame and Jan Roothaan, the Superior General, often asked him to negotiate on his behalf the foundation of Jesuit schools: Graz, Innsbruck, Linz. From time to time he was called to Rome and sent on missions to Lombardy, Hungary, and Bavaria. After teaching for a few years Canon Law at the Roman College in Rome (1842) he was sent to Belgium (1848) and was appointed Rector of the Jesuit theologate in Leuven (in 1850). But his services were required in Vienna, where the situation for the Jesuits was difficult. In 1852 Roothaan sent him again to Vienna, as provincial, and his chief negotiator. General Congregation XXII As Provincial of Austria, Beckx attended the General Congregation of June 1853, called to elect a successor to Jan Roothaan who had died in March. On 2 July, at the first ballot, Peter Jan Beckx was elected (27 votes out of 51) Superior General of the Society of Jesus. Four Assistants were also elected. The Congregation also expressed concern at the renewed attacks made against the Jesuits, and advised prudence and tact in defending the Society against its detractors. Superior General The suppression of the Society made for difficult years for the Jesuits. They were expelled from Russia in 1820, Spain (in 1854 and 1858), from Naples-Sicily (1859), from Germany (1872) from France and French colonies (1880) and even from Rome itself, in 1873, during which time Beckx shifted his headquarters to Fiesole, near Florence, where the 'Curia Generalizia' remained till 1895. Beckx wrote a good 15 letters to his Jesuit companions helping them keeping the spirit alive in the face of often vicious attacks. They are striking by their serenity and openness, in spite of the calamities they were facing, especially the letter of 1871 written to the whole Society after several French Jesuits (among whom was Pierre Olivaint) were executed during the Paris Commune of 1870. Considering the 'changing times' he was quite open to new apostolic activities. He modernized the Ratio Studiorum, giving more room to science subjects in Jesuit education and encouraging the discussion of modern Philosophers (Kant). If 'Religious freedom' could be promoted (with prudence...), questioning the temporal power of the Church was however taboo. On 1 January 1872 Beckx consecrated the Society to the Heart of Jesus: love for, and spiritual union with, the person of Jesus is central to Jesuit life and activities. New missions were begun in different parts of the world, promoted indirectly too by a growing oversee emigration of people from Europe: Cuba (1853), Colombia (1858), Philippines (1859), Madagascar (1861), Mangalore in India (1878), Armenia (1881), Australia (1882), etc. Intellectual work was encouraged too. Several journals were started: La Civilt√† Cattolica (Italy, 1850), The Month (London, 1864), Etudes (Paris, 1865), Stimmen aus Maria Laach (Germany, 1865) and others in Ireland, Poland and Belgium. During his generalship Ultramontanism largely prevailed upon the Liberal wing of Catholicism. The journal La Civilt√† Cattolica, very close to the Holy See (certain articles, it was said, were directly inspired by Pope Pius IX) was particularly engaged in the struggle: defense of the Papal States (from 1859), defense of the Syllabus of errors (1864), defense of the supremacy of the Pope (1870). This created a very negative image of the Society in several countries (especially Germany and France). During the thirty years that Beckx led the Jesuits (the third longest term), their membership doubled and a large number of new provinces were established in Ireland, France, Spain, Portugal, Missouri (USA), etc. His tenure was marked by an increased focus on missions in Protestant countries. Election of a Vicar General By 1883 - 88 years old and having spent 30 years in various offices - Peter Beckx was infirm. On his own accord he called a General Congregation in order that a 'Vicar General with rights of succession' be chosen to serve under him. General Congregation XXIII met in 1883, in Rome, and on 24 September Anton Anderledy, a Swiss Jesuit priest, was elected. Beckx, though remaining in title the 'Superior General' in effect abdicated his charge entirely. He died four years later at the age of ninety-two.

He also acted as an ad hoc judge at the Supreme Court of Canada, sitting 67 times during his career. His most significant decision is considered to be the one he wrote in R. v. Eastern Terminal Elevator Co.,[1924] ExCR 167 which was affirmed by the Supreme Court. Maclean's decision is generally considered to be highly competent, where the issue was well thought out and analyzed, in contrast with Duff J's subsequent opinion at the SCC.

Elmaloglou returned to filming when Sophie made subsequent guest appearances in 2002, 2003 and 2005. Casting In 1991, Elmaloglou was forced to take a two-week break from filming due to exhaustion. In 1992, Elmaloglou decided to quit the serial to pursue other acting projects. She admitted that she found the long working hours hard and left when it took a negative impact on her health. In 2002 Elmaloglou agreed to return to the serial as part of Summer Bay's fictional celebrations. When Sophie returns her daughter Tamara has just began attending high school and her ex-boyfriend Blake Dean (Les Hill) begins to develop romantic feelings for her again. She returned again in 2003 for Sally Fletcher's (Kate Richie) wedding, and in 2005 for Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) sixtieth birthday party. Storylines Sophie's mother died when she was young and was in and out of foster homes until her father Al (Terence Donovan) showed up and offered her a place with him. At this time Sophie was an accomplished shoplifter and con artist. Sophie arrives in Summer Bay with her father Al and continues her shoplifting ways but realises Al is only interested in her, as she is able to get him money. Al is later arrested for the murder of Shane Wilson, whom he killed eight years prior and Sophie then is fostered by Tom (Roger Oakley) and Pippa Fletcher (Vanessa Downing). Sophie becomes fast friends with Tom and Pippa's adoptive daughter Sally (Kate Ritchie). Pippa discovers that Sophie is illiterate and the family help her catch up with her education and receives extra help from newly arrived schoolteacher Grant Mitchell (Craig McLachlan). When orphaned teens Blake and Karen Dean (Belinda Jarrett) arrive in Summer Bay, Sophie quickly befriends them and takes a shine to Blake and they begin dating. Their relationship comes to a halt after Sophie kisses Haydn Ross (Andrew Hill) sparking ill- feeling between Haydn and Blake. Sophie finds herself involved in mind-games when Pippa and her new husband Michael Ross (Dennis Coard) decide to foster another teenager, Tracey Turner (Tania Martin) who takes an instant dislike to Sophie. This culminates in a vicious fight in their bedroom and Tracey is sent to live with another family After Sophie's relationship with Haydn fizzles out and she soon turns her attentions to David Croft (Guy Pearce), Donald Fisher's (Norman Coburn) nephew and a teacher at Summer Bay High. They begin a relationship and Pippa and Michael are unhappy about it and send Sophie to stay with Pippa's mother Coral King (Jessica Noad) for a while. David is killed in a car accident caused by Karen. When Sophie returns from Coral's she is heartbroken to learn David is dead and is shocked to learn she is pregnant with his child. Simon Fitzgerald (Richard Norton) agrees to pretend the child is his at first but Sophie tells him not to. She is unsure if she wants to keep the baby and considering adoption. Sophie goes into labour and Pippa and Michael are on hand to support her and she gives birth to a baby girl, who she names Tamara (Emily & Chloe Hutton). Sophie takes a job at an office to support Tamara but finds herself fighting off the unwanted advances of her boss Colin Smithers (Frank Garfield) who kisses her one day. Sophie avoids Smithers by not going into work the following day prompting concern from Pippa. Sophie tells her of Smithers' behaviour and Pippa supports her in confronting him. Shortly after, Sophie becomes infatuated with Ryan Lee (Alistair MacDougall) but he is not interested in her on the same level. Sophie then suffers a breakdown and considers putting Tamara up for adoption but David's mother, Mary (Jan Kingsbury) talks her out of it and asks her to move to Perth with her and Sophie accepts. Sophie returns for the 150th birthday of Summer Bay. She and Blake rekindle their relationship. Sophie accepts Sally and her fianc√© Flynn Saunders' (Joel McIlroy) request to be a surrogate for them, but she miscarries. She later finds out she is pregnant with Blake's baby and she goes into labour on the night before Sally and Flynn's wedding. They have a son, who Sophie names David after her first love. She and Blake break up after Blake stands her up at the registry office, but they reunite at Alf's 60th birthday party a couple of years later and resume their engagement. Reception For her portrayal of Sophie, Elmaloglou won the People's Choice Award for \\"Best Actress\\" in 1993. That same year, she received a nomination for \\"Most Popular Actress\\" at the Logie Awards. Holy Soap included Elmaloglou in their feature on the \\"Sexiest Home and Away girls ever.\\" They also said Sophie was a \\"tearaway.\\" Jess McGuire of Defamer said that she found Sophie and Blake being intimate, more disturbing to watch than Charlie Buckton and Joey Collins kissing.

Originally the city's main street in medieval times, it formed a direct north-south artery between the Cathedral of St. Mungo (later Glasgow Cathedral) in the north, to Glasgow Cross and the banks of the River Clyde. The High Street now stops at Glasgow Cross, with the southern continuation being the Saltmarket. History Model of the original University of Glasgow buildings on display at the Hunterian Museum In 1246 the Dominican Order established a monastery on the east side of the street, hence the existence of Blackfriars' Street. From 1460 to 1870, the original buildings of the University of Glasgow were located at the junction of High Street and Duke Street, before moving to Hillhead in the West End.Old College (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, late 1660s), The Glasgow StoryOld College (Mitchell Library, Joseph Swan, 1821), The Glasgow Story The site was then turned into the College Goods yardHigh Street, 1900 (Mitchell Library, Glasgow Collection, Postcards Collection), the Glasgow StoryHigh Street Goods, RailScotGlasgow, 208 High Street, High Street Goods Station, Canmore by the City of Glasgow Union Railway, before it was closed in 1968 in the wake of the Beeching Axe.

When the Industrial Revolution in Victorian times triggered the massive growth in Glasgow's size, the importance of High Street diminished as the administrative functions of the city moved westward into what is now known as the Merchant City area, whilst the medieval part of the city was left behind. The original City Chambers at the foot of High Street was closed and moved to the present building which stands overlooking George Square in the late 19th century. As the 20th century progressed, many areas of High Street fell into dereliction. However, in the early 21st century, the fortunes of High Street have enjoyed a renaissance with Glasgow's growing economy. Some developers have created upmarket apartment buildings and there are plans to develop empty sites into new student residences for the adjacent University of Strathclyde.Glasgow‚Äôs oldest street will be desecrated, its built heritage disfigured, The Guardian, 10 March 2018 Transport High Street railway station is located on High Street, on the North Clyde Line.

Career Anne Provoost was born in the Belgian town of Poperinge. She grew up in a family of four children in West Flanders and went on to pursue Germanic studies at the linked universities of Kortrijk and Leuven. Although she had been writing stories since childhood, she thought nothing of it until she began to win competitions while a student. She continued her education with a one-year course in pedagogics and then, having married Manu Claeys, went to join him in Minneapolis, where he was studying American literature. During this time, she started contributing to Belgian and American children's newspapers and also wrote her first novel, My Aunt is a Pilot Whale (1991), which is set in the USA. She returned to Belgium in 1989 and worked part-time for an international exchange organisation, but after the success of her second novel, Falling, she decided to become a full- time writer. Anne Provoost is known for remaking myths, folk tales, fairy tales, and bible stories. Once a year, she writes a letter to Hans Christian Andersen answering one of his stories.Read a translation of her second letter on her website Apart from being a novelist, Provoost also writes essays on literature and children's literatureSo here's the Bad News: the Child as Antagonist (2004) is available on her website as well as short stories. Her work, originally published in Dutch, has been translated into many European languages as well as Afrikaans, Amharic, Arabic and Turkish. She was made a member of Royal Academy of Dutch Language and Literature in 2003. In June 2007, she was a candidate for the Senate for the Flemish Green Party.The material for this article is largely gathered from the author's website and the article on her on the Dutch Wikipedia The novels Anne Provoost is counted as a novelist for young adults and her stories are usually related by youngsters from their slightly puzzled point of view. The first two of her books dealt with controversial themes. In My Aunt is a Pilot Whale it is sexual abuse. Her second novel, Falling (1994), deals with the allure of neo- Nazi rhetoric. Both these won awards and critical acclaim, particularly Falling, which has been adapted three times for theatre and was made into an English-language feature film in 2001. In 1997 Provoost retold the fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast in The Rose and the Swine, set in mediaeval Antwerp. In the Shadow of the Ark (2001) is an account of the biblical story of Noah told from the perspective of a teenage girl who was not chosen to survive the deluge. Both these take a critical look at the traditional religious mind-set, a theme she has taken further in her essay Beloved Unbelievers: Atheist Sermon (2008), in which she makes a plea for organisation in the face of right-wing Christian fundamentalism. Her newest novel, Looking into the Sun, was published 2007. It is the story of a young girl living on an Australian farm with her mother, who has bad eyesight and knows she may be going blind. Her father has died after a fall from a horse and the mother tries but fails to keep the farm going.

The district had in turn the status of local government district, urban district and municipal borough. Local Board and Urban District On 15 November 1866 the ratepayers of the township of Sale adopted the Local Government Act 1858, and a Local Board was formed to govern the town in January 1867. From 1889 it was a part of the administrative county of Cheshire. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the Local Board's area as Sale Urban District. An urban district council of 15 members replaced the local board. The neighbouring town of Ashton upon Mersey became an urban district in 1895. In 1930 a county review order merged Ashton upon Mersey Urban District into Sale UD. In December 1933 a petition was submitted to the Privy Council praying for a charter of incorporation to raise the urban district to the status of a municipal borough. At the time, Sale was the urban district with the largest population and highest rateable value in the county. The petition was successful, and the charter was presented by Sir William Bromley-Davenport the Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire on 21 September 1935.Charters for Two New Boroughs: Celebrations at Sale and Radcliffe, The Times, 12 September 1935, p. 15 The first elections to the borough council were held on 1 November. Political control The borough council consisted of a mayor, eight aldermen and twenty-four councillors. One-third of the councillors were elected annually, and half of the aldermen were chosen by the council every three years. The council initially consisted of a number of groupings, with none in a majority. Except for members of the Conservative and Labour parties, Independent, \\"Owner- Occupier\\" and \\"Trader\\" candidates were elected.

When the applied magnetic field becomes too large, superconductivity breaks down. Superconductors can be divided into two types according to how this breakdown occurs. In type-I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed via a first order phase transition when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. This type of superconductivity is normally exhibited by pure metals, e.g. aluminium, lead, and mercury. The only alloy known up to now which exhibits type I superconductivity is TaSi2. The covalent superconductor SiC:B, silicon carbide heavily doped with boron, is also type-I. Depending on the demagnetization factor, one may obtain an intermediate state. This state, first described by Lev Landau, is a phase separation into macroscopic non- superconducting and superconducting domains forming a Husimi Q representation. This behavior is different from type-II superconductors which exhibit two critical magnetic fields. The first, lower critical field occurs when magnetic flux vortices penetrate the material but the material remains superconducting outside of these microscopic vortices. When the vortex density becomes too large, the entire material becomes non-superconducting; this corresponds to the second, higher critical field. The ratio of the London penetration depth Œª to the superconducting coherence length Œæ determines whether a superconductor is type-I or type-II. Type-I superconductors are those with 0 < Œª/Œæ < 1/‚àö2, and type-II superconductors are those with Œª/Œæ > 1/‚àö2.

In 1975 - 1999, it belonged to Bielsko-Biala Voivodeship, and after the territorial reform of Poland in 1999, it became part of the Silesian Voivodeship, even though historically it does not belong to Silesia. Zwardo≈Ñ has a rail station along the historic Galician Transversal Railway, which connects ≈ªywiec and other Polish cities with Slovak town of Zilina, and further on, Vienna. Since the construction of the line, Zwardo≈Ñ has been a border station, and the crossing was closed down in 2007, due to Schengen Agreement. The village is also located on the Expressway S69, which goes from Bielsko-Bia≈Ça to Slovakia.  History  Zwardo≈Ñ is a relatively young village. It is not known exactly when it was established, most probably some time in the 17th century. Its oldest district is the settlement called Myto, which was probably established by shepherds, who came to this area from the overcrowded villages around Wƒôgierska G√≥rka. The name Zwardo≈Ñ appears on the maps for the first time in the late 18th century. The village belonged to Lesser Poland, in its extreme southwest corner, near the border with the Kingdom of Hungary. In the late 18th century, after the Partitions of Poland, and the creation of Galicia, Emperor Joseph II ordered the construction of a road along the Przys≈Çop mountain pass. Zwardo≈Ñ belonged to ≈ªywiec County, and it remained a small village until 1884, when the rail line was opened from ≈ªywiec to Cadca. By 1889, the population grew to 124, in 1891 a post office was opened here, and in 1901, an elementary school. In the 1930s Zwardo≈Ñ, which belonged to Krak√≥w Voivodeship, became a popular skiing location. Enjoying good climate, snowy winters, treeless slopes and good rail connections, the village prospered. New houses were built, in winter, special trains from Warsaw would bring tourists and skiers. In 1930, a ski jumping hill was opened. During World War II Zwardo≈Ñ was directly annexed by the Third Reich. Its 356 Polish residents were expelled, and replaced by the Germans. After the war, Zwardo≈Ñ remained a popular tourist center, due to well- developed skiing infrastructure, guest houses and several trails.

The village is situated in the Silesian Beskids mountain range, near the borders with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The Olza River flows through the village.  Etymology  The name is cultural in origin derived from the word (j)istba, meaning a room in a (especially rural) house (see also izba). It is conjectured that the name was conveyed by settlers from Istebn√© who supposedly established the village. Historically it was also known as Gistebna (1621, 1629) or Istebne (1724; the name in plural form, meaning rooms).  History  The village was first mentioned in the document from 1592 retrospectively mentioning the village Jistebne as existing in 1583. It belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia and a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. After Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political district of Cieszyn and the legal district of Jablunkov. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2,112 in 1880 to 2,245 in 1910 with the majority being native Polish-speakers (between 98.2% and 99.5%) accompanied by German-speaking (at most 33 or 1.5% in 1890) and Czech-speaking people (at most 15 or 0.7% in 1880). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (93.9%), followed by Protestants (5.9%) and Jews (6 people). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Gorals, speaking Jablunkov dialect. After World War I, fall of Austria- Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland and was transferred to Cieszyn County. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Poland. The Istebna commune passed a LGBT-free zone resolution, which was annuled as unconstitutional by a court in July 2020.

It was written by Bob Geldof, and produced by Robert John \\"Mutt\\" Lange. It replaced \\"Summer Nights\\", a hit single for John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John from the soundtrack of Grease, at number one in the UK chart after \\"Summer Nights\\" seven week reign at the top. Song It is a rock song, telling the tale of a boy called Billy who feels the depressing town he lives in is a \\"Rat Trap\\". When the band performed the song on Top of the Pops (which is also mentioned in the song) as the UK new number one, the band members began by tearing up pictures of Travolta and Newton-John to emphasise the fact that the pair - who had spent a total of 16 weeks out of the preceding 22 at the top of the charts - had been deposed. Geldof mimed the saxophone part on a candelabra, a jest he explained in his autobiography Is That It?: \\"The Musicians' Union had forbidden me to play saxophone on the video, as obviously I hadn't done so on the record. But I saw a candelabra on the piano at the shoot and I put a mouthpiece in the central candle holder and played it. The impact of video came home when during the next few British gigs kids pulled out candelabras from nowhere and began playing them during the sax solo in 'Rat Trap'\\". In the music video, which was directed by David Mallet, various members of the band are seen reading copies of the novel Rat Trap by the Welsh author Craig Thomas, although the book has no connection to the song. The lyric about \\"pus and grime...\\" was changed to \\"blood and tears pour down the drains and the sewers\\", although Geldof mumbled the line anyway. One of the more popular Boomtown Rats songs, it was performed by them at Live Aid and is still performed by Geldof to this day. During the Live Aid performance, Geldof's microphone went dead (apparently from the cable being damaged), causing Simon Crowe's harmony vocals to become the only audible voice on the last half of the song. This performance was not included on the DVD. In 1996 Geldof recorded a self-mocking cover version of the song with Dustin The Turkey which reached number one in Ireland.

Although seen only briefly, he is a major character, and serves as an important symbol of the consequences of the protagonist's choices. Character overview When Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Present he is shown just how ill the boy really is (the family cannot afford to properly treat him on the salary Scrooge pays Cratchit). When visited by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, Scrooge sees that Tiny Tim has died. This, and several other visions, lead Scrooge to reform his ways. At the end of the story, Dickens makes it explicit that Tiny Tim does not die, and Scrooge becomes a \\"second father\\" to him. In the story, Tiny Tim is known for the statement, \\"God bless us, every one!\\" which he offers as a blessing at Christmas dinner. Dickens repeats the phrase at the end of the story, symbolic of Scrooge's change of heart. As representative of the impoverished Dickens often used his characters to demonstrate the disparity between social classes that existed in England during the Victorian era, and the hardships suffered at that time by the poor. These representative characters are typically children, presumably because children are most dependent upon others for survival, especially when they come from the lower social classes. Tiny Tim is among these characters, and is the most notable example in A Christmas Carol. When the audience first meet Tiny Tim, he rests upon his father's shoulder, suggesting that while the Cratchits love their boy dearly, his situation is nonetheless a burden on the family. Further representative of this burden is Tiny Tim's crippled condition. That he is crippled evokes the financial issues that many poor families faced in 19th-century England. Although his spirit is robust, Tiny Tim's life expectancy is questionable. His crutch and iron frame support his frail body‚Äîhe \\"bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame\\", but more support is needed for Tim if he is to survive, as pointed out by the Ghost of Christmas Present in stave III: \\"I see a vacant seat in the poor chimney corner, and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die.\\" These are a microcosm of the impoverished population: without support or charity, their family will be reduced. The relationship between Scrooge and Tiny Tim is a condensed depiction of the relationship between two social classes: the wealthy and the impoverished. Tiny Tim plays a large part in Scrooge's change. Tiny Tim's fate is linked very closely to Scrooge's fate, which tightens the connection that Dickens establishes between the two social classes. If Scrooge does not change his miserly ways, Tiny Tim is sure to die. Likewise, if the wealthy do not do their part to support the impoverished, the impoverished are sure to struggle. That Dickens framed this relationship with Christmas seems to suggest the immense need for decreasing the distance between English social strata. The proximity of the Christmas spirit to the issue of social strata lends a sense of community to Dickens' message, urging the well-to-do upper class to consider the dependent poor, especially during the holiday, but year-round as well. Character development In earlier drafts, the character's name was \\"Little Fred.\\" It is thought that Dicken's pulled the name from his brothers, who both have \\"Fred\\" as a part of it. One named Alfred and the other Frederick. Dicken's also had a sister, Fanny, who had disabled son named Henry Burnett Jr. It is thought that some character aspects of Tiny Tim may be pulled from Henry; however, it has also been claimed that the character is based on the son of a friend, who owned a Cotton Mill in Ardwick, Manchester. Dickens tried other names such as \\"Tiny Mick\\" after \\"Little Fred\\" but eventually decided upon \\"Tiny Tim\\".Leigh Cowan, Alison. \\"A 166-Year-Old Manuscript Reveals Its Secrets,\\" New York Times (December 24, 2009). After dropping the name \\"Little Fred,\\" Dickens later used it for Scrooge's nephew, \\"Fred\\". Illness Dickens did not explicitly say what Tiny Tim's illness was. However, renal tubular acidosis (type 1), which is a type of kidney failure causing the blood to become acidic, has been proposed as one possibility, another being rickets (caused by a lack of vitamin D). Either illness was treatable during Dickens' lifetime, but fatal if not treated, thus following in line with the comment of the Ghost of Christmas Present that Tiny Tim would die \\"[i]f these shadows remain unaltered by the Future\\".

His name-father, Rev James Aitken, was an Auld Licht Anti-burgher minister in the Secession Church. Wylie was educated at Marischal College, University of Aberdeen, where he studied for three years before transferring to St Andrews University to study under Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers.

He was ordained at the Secessionist Church in Dollar, Clackmannanshire, in 1831.Ewing, William Annals of the Free Church In 1846 he left the church to become sub-editor of the Edinburgh religious newspaper the Witness, under Hugh Miller. In 1852, after joining the Free Church of Scotland, Wylie edited their Free Church Record, a role which he continued until 1860. He published his book The Papacy: its History, Dogmas, Genius, and Prospects in 1851, winning a prize of a hundred guineas from the Evangelical Alliance.

Doe Maar is a Dutch 1980s ska/reggae band, and is considered one of the most successful bands in Dutch pop history. His father, born in Semarang on Java, is an Indo (Dutch-Indonesian), who went to the Netherlands in 1932 after finishing his study at the Batavia HBS to continue his higher education there. Once Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands his father was involved in the Dutch resistance movement, until he was captured and interned in a German concentration camp. After the war he became one of the few Indo advocates for an independent Indonesia. In his view the principle of liberty and independence applied to both situations: Dutch independence from Nazi Germany and Indonesian independence from the colonial Netherlands.Prins, Geert, Onno, ‚ÄòPiekerans van een Popster‚Äô (Interview Moesson Magazine, edition 5, november 1999) Much of the literary work of the author Jansz is based on his Indo identity and his fathers' heritage. In 1997 Jansz married actress Jaloe Maat, the mother of his two youngest children. He has a (step)daughter from a previous marriage. He lives with his family in Neerkant, the Netherlands. Music Together with Henny Vrienten, Jansz wrote the majority of the Doe Maar-songs and alternated as lead vocalists. He was originally asked to be the band's keyboardist, and played synthesizer on many songs. His Indo background has influenced much of his work (for Doe Maar), particularly \\"Rumah Saya\\" (My House or My Home),. which he wrote and recorded in 1980 for Skunk, one of the best-sold albums in Dutch pop history.The album 'Skunk' 1981. In the song he describes that he fits in with neither Dutch nor Indonesian culture fully. > No mountains at the horizon, in this land of my birth. [...] And then I long > for the land of my father. But also there I will be a stranger. [...] Rumah > saya dimana? (Wheres my home?) Song lyrics by Ernst Jansz, 1981. Doe Maar broke into superstardom in 1982, making both Jansz and Vrienten the perfect pop-idols in their mid-thirties. Overexposure caused them to break up two years later. Ernst Jansz returned to folk band CCC Inc and did other projects as a sideman and a solo-artist. In 1995 he rejoined singer-/songwriter Boudewijn de Groot's backing band. In 2000 Doe Maar released one last album and continued to play occasional reunion-shows. Books and albums Dutch Indies literature Professor Dr. Pamela Pattynama hosting literary talkshow with guest authors Ernst Jansz and Helga Ruebsamen at the 2011 Tong Tong Fair in the Hague. Ernst Jansz has written three semi- autobiographical books: Gideons droom (Gideon's Dream, 1983) De Overkant (The Other Side, 1985), and Molenbeekstraat (Een liefdeslied 1948 ‚Äì 1970) (Molenbeekstraat: a lovesong 1948‚Äì1970), 2006). The latter two share their titles with Jansz' solo-albums. Gideons droom is about a second-generation Indo (Indo-European) Dutchman like himself; De Overkant is a three-part book dealing with letters between Jansz and his family (especially his father), the life of his mother, and an account of his trip to Indonesia.

A natural explanation of these observations is that individuals overweight low- probability events such as winning the lottery, or suffering a disastrous insurable loss. In the Allais paradox, individuals appear to forgo the chance of a very large gain to avoid a one per cent chance of missing out on an otherwise certain large gain, but are less risk averse when offered the chance of reducing an 11 per cent chance of loss to 10 per cent. A number of attempts were made to model preferences incorporating probability theory, most notably the original version of prospect theory, presented by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1979). However, all such models involved violations of first-order stochastic dominance. In prospect theory, violations of dominance were avoided by the introduction of an 'editing' operation, but this gave rise to violations of transitivity. The crucial idea of rank-dependent expected utility was to overweigh only unlikely extreme outcomes, rather than all unlikely events. Formalising this insight required transformations to be applied to the cumulative probability distribution function, rather than to individual probabilities (Quiggin, 1982, 1993). The central idea of rank- dependent weightings was then incorporated by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky into prospect theory, and the resulting model was referred to as cumulative prospect theory (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). Formal representation As the name implies, the rank-dependent model is applied to the increasing rearrangement \\\\mathbf{y}_{[ \\\\; ]} of \\\\mathbf{y} which satisfies y_{[1]}\\\\leq y_{[2]}\\\\leq ...\\\\leq y_{[S]}.

With Kleist, he created a complex classification of psychotic illnesses called Nosology. His work covered psychology, psychotherapy, biological psychiatry and biological psychology. Moreover, he created a classification of nonverbal communication. Life He was born at Edelsfeld in Bavaria as the sixth of eleven children, his father being a Protestant minister. His medical education (at Erlangen, Berlin and Munich) was completed in 1928 and he worked as a physician at psychiatric hospitals in Erlangen, then a year later Gabersee and from 1936 Frankfurt am Main, to which last he was called by Karl Kleist. During the period of the Third Reich in order to save his patients from being killed by means of the T-4 Euthanasia Program, he stopped making diagnoses that would endanger a patient. In particular he stopped making any diagnoses of schizophrenia. He became a professor at Frankfurt in 1944 and a professor at Erfurt in the Soviet zone of Germany in 1954. In 1957 he became director of the psychiatric department at the Charit√© Hospital linked to the Humboldt University in East Berlin. He wanted to move back to West Germany in the 1960s, but was refused permission by the East German authorities. As compensation he got increased support for his scientific work. During his lifetime he interviewed more than 2000 psychotic patients, latterly with Dr Sieglinde von Trostorff. He died in East Berlin in 1988. According to Helmut Beckmann (see \\"Books\\" below), editors of Western journals rejected his papers because \\"they were not in conformity with the standard practice of Anglo-American psychiatry and also because he pursued without compromise his own path derived from his findings.\\" Most of his work was not translated into English. However summaries of Leonhard's views were included by Frank Fish in his \\"Schizophrenia\\" of 1962 (2nd edition 1976 ) and \\"Clinical Psychopathology\\" of 1967 (2nd edition 1985 ) which were widely read, if not understood, in their day. Today diagnosis for psychotic patients and mentally or otherwise ill persons are most commonly placed by ICD or DSM criteria. Psychosis will in general appear as an affective disorder (e.g. psychotic depression), a psychotic disorder (e.g. catatonic type of schizophrenia) or a mixture of both types, as evident in the schizoaffective disorder. The Classification of Psychosis by Leonhard Leonhard is well known for his classification of psychosis, based on the teamwork involving himself, his mentor Karl Kleist and fellow Kleist student Edda Neele. The classification is sometimes referred to as the Kleist-Leonhard classification system.Teichmann G. The influence of Karl Kleist on the nosology of Karl Leonhard.

They entered service in 1936 (three weeks after the Midland railcars) and were classified RM like all other classes of railcars in New Zealand; they came to be known as the \\"Wairarapa\\" class as they were designed to operate over the famous Rimutaka Incline to the Wairarapa region on the Wairarapa Line. They also acquired the nickname of \\"tin hares\\" in New Zealand railfan jargon. The first two to be introduced re- used the numbers RM 4 and RM 5 that had previously been used by the withdrawn experimental Model T Ford railcars. The class consisted of six passenger railcars and one passenger-freight railcar. It is often described incorrectly as a class of six railcars.  Background  The Rimutaka Incline over the Rimutaka Ranges posed a severe time delay to any service operating between Wellington and the Wairarapa region. At one end of the Incline, a train had to have its engine replaced by multiple members of the H class, as the H class locomotives were specially designed to work the steep and difficult Incline. Once they hauled the train the length of the Incline, they were then replaced by a single ordinary engine. The procedure to attach and remove the H class locomotives, as well as the actual trip along the Incline, was very slow. The Wairarapa railcars were designed as an answer to this problem. They were intended to operate along the length of the Incline and take over Wairarapa passenger services from regular carriage trains. Their body was built higher than an ordinary railcar, with a raised floor, to enable them to pass over the raised Fell centre rail on the Rimutaka Incline. In design, they resembled a bus, and unlike a usual single-unit railcar that has a driving compartment at each end, the Wairarapa railcars only had one driving end, necessitating that they be turned at the terminus of their journey. The first six of the class (RM 4 to RM 9) were designed to carry 49 passengers with their baggage. These were named after historic Maori canoes: Maahunui, Mahuhu, Mamari, Matahourua, Maatua, and Arai-te-Uru. A seventh railcar, RM 10, named Arawa, was built as a mixed freight and passenger vehicle with seating for 20 passengers at the front, a freight compartment with a capacity of 3 tons in the centre, and a guards compartment at the rearThe Arawa, a rail-car of a new type, taking its trial run over the Hutt Line on Saturday. Evening Post, Volume CXXIII, Issue 39, 16 February 1937, p.9  Operation  Upon their introduction to revenue service on 7 September 1936,McNaught (2011), p.52. the Wairarapa railcars became the second successful class of railcars in New Zealand, following the introduction of the Midland class three weeks earlier. The Wairarapa railcars immediately slashed running times between Wellington and the Wairarapa, and would operate the full length of the Wairarapa Line from Wellington to Woodville, and then utilise the Palmerston North‚ÄìGisborne Line through the Manawatu Gorge to access Palmerston North. They proved popular with passengers, fully replacing a locomotive-hauled carriage train known as the Wairarapa Mail in 1948, though local mixed trains continued to operate. The composite passenger-goods railcar RM 10 entered service on 1 March 1937. Although able to traverse the Rimutaka Incline like the other six Wairarapa class railcars, RM 10 worked between Cross Creek and Masterton carrying mainly school children, parcels and light freight, and cans of milk and cream. This railcar was withdrawn from service at the end of 1946 when it was found that a locomotive was having to run between Cross Creek and Masterton at the same time as the railcar, to attend to shunting duties.McNaught (2011), p.53. The resulting mixed train (goods with passenger car attached) was subsequently referred to locally as The Arawa.  Withdrawal and preservation  The replacement of the Rimutaka Incline by the Rimutaka Tunnel in November 1955 meant that the main reason for the Wairarapa railcars' operation ceased to exist. Locomotive hauled trains were now competitive in timings with the railcars, which were soon withdrawn from service. By 1956, the six remaining cars were in storage at Hutt Workshops awaiting an uncertain future. They became increasingly derelict, as they were stored outside and enthusiasts often removed small parts as 'souvenirs' of the railcars. In 1969, the Wellington Branch of the New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society purchased the remains of RM 4, 5, 6, and 9 for preservation at their Gracefield site. To move the cars from Hutt Shops to Gracefield, the NZR&LS; members physically shunted the railcars from the works to Gracefield, as the railcars' diesel engines were not at that time operable. When the group shifted to Seaview, RM 5 (by then working again) was used as an impromptu shunting engine to move the group's collection. After arrival, it was decided to restore RM 5 Mahuhu to working order as it was felt to be in the best condition. RM 4 (which had been damaged in a level crossing collision before withdrawal), RM 6, and RM 9 Arai- te-uru were relegated to being spare parts sources. RM 4 and RM 6 were scrapped in the 1970s after all re-usable components were stripped from their hulks, while RM 5 and RM 9 were placed into storage at the SSR. With no plans for the SSR to restore either, the decision was made in 1992 to lease RM 5 to the newly formed Pahiatua Railcar Society, who would then restore it to mainline operating standards. The car arrived at Pahiatua in 1992, and work began to slowly restore the car to operable condition. As RM 5 was missing many parts, the decision was made in 2002 to acquire the remains of RM 9 for use as a spare parts source to complete the restoration of RM 5. Arriving in 2003, the incomplete frames of RM 9 became a source of spare parts that could be duplicated or restored for use on its sister car. There are no plans to restore RM 9 in its own right as a rail vehicle, and it will most likely be scrapped once it is no longer useful. Originally, the 'Wairarapa' railcars had wooden internal framing covered with steel sheathing; however, RM 5's body had decayed so far the decision was made to replace the original wooden framing with steel. This improves the railcar's 'crashworthiness', quite apart from being less maintenance-intensive. Restoration of RM 5 was completed in 2017 after an effort spanning 26 years.

The station uses the on-air brand name Jack FM. It is the second Jack FM station in Canada and the world, after its sister CJAX-FM in Vancouver. CJAQ's studios are located on 7th Avenue Southwest in downtown Calgary, while its transmitter is located on Patina Hill Drive Southwest in the Prominence Point neighbourhood in west Calgary. As of Fall 2014, CJAQ is ranked #8 in the Calgary market ratings according to Numeris Canada.Fall 2014 Calgary PPM Ratings History The station originally signed on in 1927 as CJCJ, an AM radio station located on 1230 AM. In the 1941 great frequency shuffle of most North American AM stations it moved to its longtime frequency of 1140. In 1950, it adopted the call letters that it would become most historically identified with by most Calgary radio listeners, CKXL (or simply \\"XL\\" for short). It adopted a Top 40 format in 1964. On September 4, 1987, the station dropped Top 40 for adult contemporary as Kiss AM 1140 with the CISS call letters. A year later it went oldies full-time. 2 talk shows (Charles Adler and the Larry King Show) were also added briefly in 1990. In September 1991, the station flipped to classic rock as The Fox with the CFXX, and, later on, CFXL call letters.

She also played in King Richard the Third, being the first representative of that play seen in Richmond Theatre since the death of the great actor Edmund Kean. She played in other cities prior to coming to America in 1838. Her first appearance in America occurred at the National Theatre, New York, under the management of James William Wallack, the Elder. Afterward she played star engagements in other cities. In 1842 she returned to Europe and traveled in Italy and France. Her education, at that time, was conducted by private tutors. In Paris, she studied music under the tuition of Garc√≠a, but decided to pursue a career in drama. In 1846 she went to the Netherlands, taking an English company, with whom she acted at Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague, and, in Germany, at Hamburg and Hanover, receiving adulation, acclamation and adoration. That tour occupied two years and was remunerative. In England in 1848 she made her appearance as a public reader, being one of the first women to give readings from Shakespeare since Sarah Siddons, who died in 1831. Her second visit to America was made in 1849, and she determined to make it her home. Her father died at Cincinnati, Ohio on July 5, 1851, and, in the following year, she went once more to England, there to settle the affairs of her parents‚Äô estate and to study for the next dramatic season. Jean Margaret Davenport Lander In 1853, she returned to her adopted country, then made her first visit to California in 1855 and again traveled to England a few times (1856‚Äì1859). In San Francisco, she became the wife of transcontinental explorer and civil engineer Frederick W. Lander on October 12, 1860. Her married life was happy, but brief; her husband, by then a brigadier general during the Civil War, died of pneumonia in camp on March 3, 1862, after his requests for medical leave were ignored. President Abraham Lincoln attended the funeral at the Church of the Epiphany (Washington, D.C.). For two years, Jean Lander subsequently served as a supervisor in charge of the nurses working in the Union Army hospitals at Beaufort, South Carolina. On April 19, 1861, at approximately midnight ‚Äî when Washington, D.C., was expecting the Confederate Army to invade at any moment ‚Äî Jean Davenport Lander knocked on the door of the White House. She met with John Hay, Lincoln's assistant secretary, and told him she'd heard from a Virginian that he and several other men \\"would do a thing within forty-eight hours that would ring throughout the world.\\" Jean believed he meant that the gang intended to capture or assassinate the president, and she came to warn him. On February 5, 1865, Jean Davenport Lander reappeared, acting at Niblo's Garden Theatre, New York, in a drama called M√©salliance. The arrival of Adelaide Ristori to America brought a new set of characters into vogue -- Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary Stuart, Queen Marie Antoinette, etc. -- and Lander availed herself of that new predilection of popular taste. Her performance of Queen Elizabeth was first seen at the National Theatre, Washington, in April 1867. She was the original representative, in America, of Marguerite Gauthier, a part which she named Camille, -- acting it in a play that she had adapted from La Dame aux Cam√©lias, by Alexandre Dumas, fils; her adaptation was \\"edited\\" by John Wilkin, an English journalist, and it was first presented to her in Philadelphia. She was the original representative in America of Legouv√©'s Med√©e, in English, and of Colombe; she also acted in Robert Browning's Colombe's Birthday; Peg Woffington; in Charles Reade's Masks and Faces, and as Hester Prynne, in Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter. Her last appearance was made at the Boston Theatre, January 1, 1877, in The Scarlet Letter. Death and legacy The later years of her life were passed in retirement, in Washington. She died at her summer residence in Lynn, Massachusetts on August 3, 1903.(4 August 1903). Mrs. Lander, Actress, Dead, The New York Times(16 August 1903).

Dickens Davenport was most likely the inspiration for the character of Ninetta Crummles, the \\"infant phenomenon\\" child actress in the Charles Dickens novel Nicholas Nickleby, and her father the model for theatre-manager Vincent Crummles, though the Davenport family issued denials of the claim.Gubar, Marah.

Its creator may have chosen not to finish it, or may have been prevented from doing so by circumstances beyond control, such as death. Such pieces are often the subject of speculation as to what the finished piece would have been like had the original creator completed the work. Sometimes artworks are finished by others and released posthumously. Unfinished works have had profound influences on their genres and have inspired others in their own projects. The term can also refer to ongoing work which could eventually be finished (i.e. the creator is still living) and is distinguishable from \\"incomplete work\\", which can be a work that was finished but is no longer in its complete form. There are many reasons for work not being completed. Works are usually stopped when their creator dies, although some, aware of their failing health, make sure that they set up the project for completion. If the work involves other people, such as a cast of actors or the subject of a portrait, it may be halted because of their unavailability. Projects that are too grandiose might never have been finished, while others should be feasible but their creator's continual unhappiness with them leads to abandonment. Unfinished works by popular authors and artists may still be made public, sometimes in the state they were in when work was halted. Alternatively, another artist may finish the piece. In some fields work may appear unfinished but are actually finished, such as Donatello's \\"non finito\\" technique in sculpture. Media=Literature Franz Kafka's unfinished writings were released after his death despite his wishes for them to be destroyed. Many acclaimed authors have left work incomplete. Some such pieces have been published posthumously, either in their incomplete state or after being finished by somebody else. It is the job of literary executors to take charge of the work of a writer after the writer's death. They must often decide what to do with incomplete work, using their own judgement if not given explicit instructions. In some cases, this can lead to something happening to the work that was not originally intended, such as the release of Franz Kafka's unfinished writings by Max Brod when Kafka had wished for them to be destroyed. These works have become iconic in Western literature. Contijoch, Francesc Miralles (2000) \\"Franz Kafka\\". Oceano Grupo Editorial, S.A. Barcelona. . The posthumous publication of some of Ernest Hemingway's unfinished novels was met with controversy. Several books were published, but it has been suggested that it is not within the jurisdiction of Hemingway's relatives or publishers to determine whether these works should be made available to the public. For example, scholars often disapprovingly note that the version of The Garden of Eden published by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1986, though not a revision of Hemingway's original words, nonetheless omits two-thirds of the original manuscript.BookRags makes this quantitative note; it also reveals some more information about the publication of The Garden of Eden and offers some discussion of thematic content. Mark Twain took 20 years to write three versions of The Mysterious Stranger but he did not finish any of them. Novels can remain unfinished because the author continually rewrites the story. When enough material exists, someone else can compile and combine the work, creating a finished story from several different drafts. Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger was written in three different versions over a period of 20 years, none of which were completed. Twain biographer and literary executor Albert Paine combined the stories and published his version six years after Twain's death.\\"A History of War\\". Accessed 6 August 2006 Similarly, J. R. R.

The most influential document in computer science was John von Neumann's First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC, a 101-page manuscript dating from 1946. Littered with ellipses and spaces for the eventual addition of further material, von Neumann never completed it, as by that time its distribution had already influenced an explosion in postwar computer development. Its elaboration of the stored program concept and formalization of the logical design of computer architecture--ideas not all of which were original to von Neumann but which he first expressed in the mathematical language he favoured--endure in the architectures of modern computer systems.Goldstine, Herman H. 1972.

Treaty of Paris, Benjamin West's 1783-84 painting of the American delegates to the 1783 Treaty of Paris which ended the American Revolutionary War, left out the British delegation who, out of shame for their country's defeat, refused to pose and so the portrait was never finished. Dickens' Dream, by Robert William Buss, begun on the death of Charles Dickens in 1870, and incomplete at the time of the painter's death in 1875. Artists leave behind incomplete work for a variety of reasons. A piece may not be completed if the subject becomes unavailable, such as in the changing of a landscape or the death of a person being painted. Elizabeth Shoumatoff's Unfinished Portrait of 32nd U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt was started around noon on 12 April 1945 but left unfinished when Roosevelt died later that day. In other instances, outside circumstances can prevent the execution of an otherwise \\"finished\\" artwork: Leonardo da Vinci developed sketches and models for the \\"Gran Cavallo\\" horse statue but the bronze to cast the sculpture was diverted to make cannons.

Paintings are usually sketched on the canvas before work begins, and sculptures are frequently planned using a maquette. These works-in-progress can be as sought after as (or even more sought after than) completed works by highly regarded artists because they help reveal the process of creating a work of art. Gian Lorenzo Bernini, a sculptor from the Baroque period, made his bozzetti (an Italian term for the prototype sculpture) from wax or baked terracotta to show those that had commissioned him how the final piece was intended to look. Eleven of these bozzetti were displayed in an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2004.Cassidy, Victor M. artnet. 2004. \\"Chicago Report\\". Accessed 22 August 2006.

In the age of mass media, incomplete work can reach an audience due to sheer demand for material by the artist. Tintin and Alph-Art, the 24th comic in Herg√©'s popular The Adventures of Tintin series, was unfinished at his death. Though he had illustrated a significant part of the book, several sketched panels remained in the final scenes, with no clear outline for the last third of the story. The book was still published and the story can be followed despite the incomplete artwork. Architecture, construction and engineering Many construction or engineering projects have remained unfinished at various stages of development. The work may be finished as a blueprint or whiteprint and never be realised, or be abandoned during construction. There are numerous unfinished buildings that remain partially constructed in countries around the world, some of which can be used in their incomplete state, while others remain as mere shells.

MusicClassical music= In the days of classical music, all compositions were sketched on manuscripts ‚Äì the technology to record music did not exist. Often these manuscripts are roughly sketched, with drafting work scribbled over the top of the music, and have been found in unordered piles. Many unfinished symphonies have been pieced together from these original manuscripts by other composers, after the original author's death, with some remaining incomplete until many decades later. One of the most famous examples of unfinished musical compositions is Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor, or as it is more commonly known, The Unfinished Symphony.Vial Jaffe, Jane. Stockton Symphony Association. \\"Symphony No. 8 in B minor, D759 \\". Accessed 9 August 2006. Another famous unfinished classical piece is Mozart's Requiem, famous in part because of the numerous myths and legends that surround its creation and in part because of Mozart's prestige. At the time of his death, Mozart had fully orchestrated only the first movement, leaving nine further movements in varying states of completion. Franz Xaver S√ºssmayr, an acquaintance of Mozart, finished the nine incomplete movements and wrote four more. Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 10 was incomplete, with only drafts, sketches, and two mostly orchestrated movements existing at the composer's death. Several people have \\"completed\\" it with varying degrees of success, the most notable of these being Deryck Cooke's \\"performing version of the draft.\\" J. S. Bach's The Art of Fugue breaks off abruptly during Contrapunctus XIV. Some compositions are finished \\"in the style of\\" the original composer, with someone who is highly familiar with the work adopting the same writing style and continuing the musical tone. Johann Sebastian Bach's The Art of Fugue, which was broken off abruptly during Contrapunctus XIV, probably shortly before the death of the composer, was first published in the mid 18th century. Many reconstructions have been written, but in 1991 Zolt√°n G√∂ncz used the form of a permutation fugue to make a strong argument as to the structure of the Fugue to come.G√∂ncz, Z. 1997.

Sir Edward Elgar was composing a Symphony No. 3 at the time of his death and left 130 pages of sketches. These sketches were put into a reasonable order, orchestrated in the style of Elgar, and elaborated by Anthony Payne. Payne's reconstruction has been played numerous times to great acclaim. Some works, deemed complete by the composer, are nonetheless augmented for non-musical reasons. In May 2000 composer Colin Matthews premiered his \\"completion\\" of Gustav Holst's The Planets, whereby he composed a new movement for the ninth planet Pluto, giving it the name \\"Pluto, The Renewer\\".

Alban Berg had only finished the first two acts of his opera Lulu at the time of his death in 1935. Due to objections from his widow, it was not until 1979 that a full version was performed, with music for the final act devised by Friedrich Cerha using Berg's sketches.Viking Opera Guide, ed. Holden (Viking, 1994): articles on Puccini and Berg. Other musical works which are unfinished but performable, are simply given in their incomplete state. Schubert's symphony is the most famous, but Anton Bruckner's Ninth Symphony is performed without a finale, and in Karl Amadeus Hartmann's Gesangsszene, the final words of Jean Giraudoux's text, left unset at the composer's death, are simply spoken by the soloist.

Film Orson Welles left behind numerous unfinished films. Films may not be completed for several reasons, with some being shelved during different stages of the production. Arrive Alive was scrapped after a week of filming when the comedy was not living up to the screenplay. Shelving a film without it ever being released can be very expensive for the studios, with Arrive Alive costing $7 million. With so many people involved in filmmaking it is possible for a film to remain incomplete because of an injury or death. While a member of the crew (even a producer or director) can often be replaced, it is much more difficult to change to a different actor if many of the scenes have already been filmed, or if a character is strongly associated with an actor's physic, voice, or demeanor, or special skills. For example, Dark Blood was cancelled 80% of the way through filming due, to the death of its star River Phoenix. However, the film premiered to a private guest audience on September 27, 2012 at the Netherlands Film Festival in Utrecht, Netherlands. Some films have been completed despite such problems. A famous example is Bruce Lee's Game of Death. Lee died during the filming, and the rest of the filming was finished with Tai Chung Kim, a Lee look-alike, acting as a double, and Yuen Biao acting as a stunt double for action scenes.

Television Consisting of many episodes that are grouped together in seasons or series, a long-form television show that intends to tell a continuous, long story can be cancelled for any reason before it broadcasts all of its planned episodes and resolves all story arcs and its central premise. This can happen as the series is getting started, or even before a single episode has been broadcast. In most cases, to get a series broadcast, its creators must typically produce a pilot episode to convince a television network to pick up and support it. There is no guarantee that the pilot will air, the network holds the final say on whether the series will go forward. There is also a chance that the network can cancel the series just after it airs roughly half of its first season and issue a mid-season replacement that would air instead of the second half of episodes. If a series fails to start, it would technically be unfinished in the sense that substantial effort was put into developing it and much more work could have been done on it had it actually been able to begin. At the end of a season, a television series is cancelled if its network does not order any future seasons to follow, and would thus be unfinished if it does not resolve all of its planned story arcs and central premise by that time. In such situation, the series' creators may make a passionate bid to keep the series going by intentionally ending the current season finale on a cliffhanger to give fans the impression that the series' overarching story hasn't been resolved and/or there are much more stories to tell, as well as emphasize that it would not make sense to discontinue it. Unfortunately, this tactic does not always succeed, and can potentially produce an exacerbating bout of disappointment if the series is nevertheless cancelled and left truly unfinished - a fate that befell Marvel's Iron Fist. Alternatively, the creators of a series put in a similar predicament may choose to design the season finale to function like a series finale so as to bring a sense of closure to the audience if the series is indeed cancelled and prevented from fully accomplishing its goals. Some unfinished television series may be revived for various reasons and ultimately given a proper ending. Two ubiquitous examples of unfinished series that were finally completed years after they were cancelled were Samurai Jack and the 2008 3D Star Wars: The Clone Wars, two animated series that ran for several seasons on Cartoon Network before being cancelled without having a proper ending in place. Samurai Jack was cancelled in 2004 after four seasons without a conclusive resolution to its central plot, which Adult Swim eventually provided when it revived the series for a fifth and final season in 2017. Clone Wars was cancelled in 2013 partway through its planned run in favor of other Star Wars projects headed by Disney after it acquired Lucasfilm a year prior. The series would remain unfinished for years until Disney and Lucasfilm decided to revive and finally finish it with one final season, set to be exclusively released on Disney+ on February 17, 2020.

The 1980 Doctor Who serial Shada was abandoned after strike action prevented the cast and crew from gaining access to the studio, and rearranging filming of the serial was deemed as less important than recording Christmastime programming, so it was left incomplete. A 1992 release linked filmed scenes with narration to describe missing scenes, for a VHS release; then in 2017, the original cast was reunited to record audio for an animated reconstruction of missing scenes according to the original script. Software Computer software, particularly games, are sometimes cancelled quite far into their development. Occasionally they are demonstrated to the press so that previews can be written but are never completed or published. Amen: The Awakening had an extensive preview written in the magazine PC Paradox in 1999, including numerous screenshots, which generated a lot of interest in the project. However, it was cancelled the following year.PlanetPhillip. 18 August 2004. \\"Amen: The Awakening \\". Accessed 12 August 2006. Due to continued interest in a game, some are eventually made available in their unfinished state. Combat 2, the sequel to the 1977 Atari VCS-bundled game Combat, was never completed, but many years later, at the 2001 Classic Gaming Expo, 200 copies of the unfinished game were sold after a company created a box and manual.AtariAge. \\"Combat Two\\". Accessed 12 August 2006. Software undergoes a testing phase that helps to eliminate problems before it is released; however, beta testing is a form of testing where the software is open to the public (usually limited to a set number of people or organisations) but is still essentially unfinished. This is often an important part of the development of a software package. If a piece of software is becoming overly delayed the developer may just release the program despite the presence of a few bugs. The Internet has allowed patches to be deployed that fix these bugs, but before such technology was available the problems could not be fixed after the game was published. Even with this, a game with too many bugs when it is made public will receive very poor reviews that will undoubtedly affect sales. For example, 2002's Destroyer Command received some very positive reviews about many aspects of the game but was criticised for the number of glitches it contained that, given a lengthier software testing phase, should have been fixed.Metacritic. \\"Destroyer Command\\". Accessed 12 August 2006. Some developers choose to disable certain features in order to release the game on time, especially if a project has seen an amount of feature creep.

The United States have taken the step of creating a law which specifically mentions ongoing work, whereby work which is in progress but will in the future be completed can be covered by copyright. On 27 April 2005 the \\"Artist's Rights and Theft Prevention Act\\", a subpart of the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act, was signed into U.S. law.

For example, a photographer can preregister a photograph by giving a written description of what the final piece (or collection thereof) will look like before the work is finished.Lang, Daryl. 14 November 2005. \\"New Copyright Law Lets Photographers Register Unfinished Work\\". Accessed 9 August 2006. In copyright law, an artistic creation that includes major, basic copyrighted aspects of an original, previously created first work is known as a 'derivative work'. This holds for all kinds of work, including those that have never officially been published. The rights of the first work's originator must be granted to the secondary work for it to be rightfully called a 'derivative work'. If no copyright permission is granted from the originator, it is instead called a 'copy'. Upon completion of the new piece both parties hold a joint copyright status, with both having to agree to any publications. When the copyright has lapsed for the original work the second artist fully owns the copyright for their work, but cannot stop distribution of the original piece or another artist from completing the work in their own way. However, such copyrights can only be granted if the work shows significant new creative content.

However, his international reputation rests on his expertise as an amateur ornithologist and naturalist. He was one of the principal founders of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) in 1901 and served as its President in 1909 and 1928. He was also a founder member of the Victorian Wattle Club in 1899 and the Bird Observers Club in 1905. Campbell was active in the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria from its inception in 1880, leading pioneering expeditions and writing for their journal.Mather, K 2017, 'King Island‚Äôs lake of many names - Lake Flannigan: points of interest from the literature', The Victorian Naturalist, vol 134, iss 6, pp. 207‚Äì214. He wrote the classic field guide to oology (a branch of ornithology) in Australia: Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds, published in 1901.  Early life  Campbell (the ornithologist) shared his personal names, Archibald James, with his father, so to avoid confusion the ornithologist will be referred to throughout this article as \\"Campbell\\", whilst his father will be named in full. Campbell's parents were both Scots from Glasgow. Archibald James Campbell (1817-1872) was born in an area of Glasgow known as the Gorbals, as was his future wife, Catherine Pinkerton (1833-1882). Landing at Melbourne 1840 - a watercolour by WFE Liardet, State Library of Victoria, Australia Travelling without other family members, the 22 year-old Archibald James Campbell arrived in Melbourne in June 1840, on the barque, the Statesman. He obtained employment in Melbourne, in the Victorian Education Department,Johns, F 1906, Johns's Notable Australians, George Robertson, Melbourne Victoria Australia, p. 42. but in 1851 he moved to the rural Werribee River area which was being taken over for agricultural/pastoral purposes. Before that, the Pinkerton extended family of twelve people had arrived in Melbourne on the barque Superb, in December 1839. By 1852, the Australian Electoral Roll records that several members of the Pinkerton family owned large tracts of freehold land on the Werribee River, used mainly to pasture sheep for the wool trade. In that year Archibald James Campbell married Catherine Pinkerton. The first of their children was their son, AJ Campbell, born in February 1853. William Campbell, Campbell's uncle, married Margaret Pinkerton (1829-1920), Campbell's aunt, in 1864. Years later, Margaret Pinkerton's 90th birthday was celebrated, and was described in a lengthy article in the Argus, 10 May 1919, p. 6, providing many details of life in rural Victoria in the mid-1800s. Migrant families experienced for the first time the most basic living conditions, epidemics of serious diseases (for both humans and animals), and destructive natural hazards including fire, flood and drought. Diggings in the Mount Alexander district of Victoria in 1852, by ST Gill, National Library of Australia Landowners were also faced with another insuperable problem - the vanishing of their farm labourers whenever news of another discovery was reported in the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s and early 1860s. In addition, the cost of living increased dramatically because of the influx of diggers, and gold soon displaced wool as Australia's chief export commodity.Blainey, G 2016, The story of Australia's people: the rise and fall of new Australia, Penguin, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, pp. 22-23.Black, M 2016, Up came a squatter : Niel Black of Glenormiston, 1839-1880, New South Publishing, Sydney, NSW, Australia, pp. 129-130. Catherine and Margaret Pinkerton lost their mother, two siblings and a young cousin between 1855 and 1858, and Campbell's brother John Ecker Campbell died in 1860, aged 14 months. The head of the Pinkerton family, James, retired to Bacchus Marsh in 1862, and the Campbell family returned to Melbourne.Kissock, M and White, E 1931, A pioneering family, in the possession of the family, Australia.Mattingley, AH 1929, 'Obituary: Archibald James Campbell (1853-1929)', Emu: Austral ornithology, 29,3, p.228-230.  Career  On 18 February 1896, at the age of 16, Campbell obtained full-time work in the Victorian Government Customs Service as a \\"Landing waiter\\"Australia, 1904, Commonwealth Public Service List, Department of Trade and Customs, Canberra, ACT, Australia. (although several biographical articles give his job name as \\"landing weigher\\"). His next significant career step was confirmed on 12 September 1874 when his name appeared in The Argus (Melbourne) newspaper's list (page 7) of those who had passed the Civil Service Examination. The Victorian Customs Service was amalgamated with that of the other states in 1901, at the time of Federation, creating the Department of Trade and Customs (Australia). Campbell remained with the Service throughout his working life, until his retirement in July 1914.Carland, R 2008, 'Archibald James Campbell, Naturalist (1853-1929)', Museums Victoria Collections, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, accessed 26 Nov 2017, https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/1516.  Study of Australian birds  Nest and eggs of the Magpie-lark Grallina cyanoleuca, 1901, photograph by AJ Campbell In the introduction to his presentation to the Field Naturalists Club of Victoria (FNCV) in 1883Campbell, AJ 1883, Nests and eggs of Australian birds, embracing papers on \\"Oology of Australian birds\\", read before the Field Naturalists' Club of Victoria, published by the author, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. Campbell explains that his topic, Oology (or o√∂logy), is a branch of ornithology that is devoted to the study of bird eggs and nests as an aid to identifying individual birds, and of learning about their movements and distribution across the country. The fact that Campbell was invited to speak at the FNCV indicates that, by the age of 30, he had become a recognized expert on Australian birds, nests and eggs. Golden Whistler Pachycephala pectoralis, in The birds of Australia, 1840‚Äì48. Artists: J. Gould and E. Gould; Lithographer: E. Gould The FNCV was established in 1880 and is Victoria's oldest field naturalists club.Smith, A 2010, 'The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria Inc (1880 - )', Encyclopedia of Australian Science, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, accessed 22 Nov 2017, http://www.eoas.info/biogs/A001665b.htm. Members are professional scientists, students and amateurs who study the natural world by going out into the environment. Since the establishment of the Club, members have regularly arranged field trips for research, published scientific papers in their journal the Victorian Naturalist, and have taken an active and public role in promoting conservation and protection. Campbell had close working relationships with other prominent scientists in the FNCV, amongst whom was Professor Walter Baldwin Spencer, head of the Department of Biology at Melbourne University, and Dudley Le Sou—ëf, an ornithologist and zoo director. Le Sou—ëf in particular shared the same special interests as Campbell, being a photographer and presenter of \\"lantern lectures\\", the owner of an impressive egg collection, and working with Campbell in establishing the RAOU and its journal, Emu. Campbell also freely acknowledged his debt to the Englishman who had become the pioneer of Australian ornithology, John Gould (1804-1881).Chisholm, AH 1996, 'Gould, John (1804‚Äì1881)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Canberra, ACT, Australia, accessed 21 Nov 2017, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/gould-john-2113. Both men shared an absence of secondary and tertiary education; and both undertook self-education so thoroughly that they became pre-eminent in their fields, and the books they wrote quickly became the standard scientific texts on their chosen subjects. Gould's Birds of AustraliaGould, J 1848, The birds of Australia: in seven volumes, published by the author, London, England. provided a foundation for Campbell's 1883 presentation and 1901 book on Nests and eggs of Australian birds.Campbell, AJ 1901, Nests and eggs of Australian birds, including the geographical distribution of the species and popular observations thereon, Pawson and Brailsford for the author, Sheffield, England. Where Gould described many species of Australian birds new to science, Campbell added innovative information about eggs and nests.Robin, L 2001, 'An Emu for a nation: a centenary reflection on the journal and its discipline', Emu: Austral ornithology, 102, 1, p.3. 'Rose-breasted robin' by CC Brittlebank, page 142 of Nests and Eggs, 1840‚Äì1848. Modern name: Rose robin Petroica rosea. Both writers made use of the newest technology available to illustrate their scientific data. Until 1840, Gould's pictures of birds were drawn and painted by his wife Elizabeth Coxon; many were reproduced by means of the recently invented technique of hand-painted lithographs; forty years later, Campbell's images of nests, eggs and habitat were created by the cutting edge technology of photography. In his text Campbell frequently refers the reader to Gould's illustrations of the birds that he (Campbell) is writing about, e.g. in his entry on page 87 for the Magpie Lark Grallina cyanoleuca Campbell notes that the bird is illustrated in: \\"Figure - Gould: Birds of Australia, fol., vol.ii, plate 54\\". However, he does also include in his own text several coloured illustrations (that of the Rose robin, for instance), drawn by artists. Campbell received great acclaim during his lifetime, such as being invited to be a Colonial Member of the British Ornithologists' Union in 1902, and an Honorary Fellow of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1904National Library of Australia 2002, Guide to the papers of Archibald Campbell MS9650, National Library of Australia, Canberra, ACT, Australia, p. 3. and this international recognition was important for the Australian ornithological community as a whole. Two leading Australian ornithological organisations owed their existence, at least in part, to Campbell, who was instrumental in their creation: the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union (RAOU) founded in 1901, and the (Victorian) Bird Observers Club founded in 1905.  Study of Australian plants  After birds, Campbell's most intense fascination was with Australian native flora, and particularly wattle trees (acacias) of which there are currently thought to be 1070 species.Walsh, N 2015, VicFlora: Flora of Victoria, Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria: Foundation Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, accessed 27 Nov. 2017, https://vicflora.rbg.vic.gov.au/flora/taxon/dfe52d12-cc3f-4620-8a9b-ab8361322615. Campbell successfully campaigned for the Golden Wattle Acacia pycnantha to become Australia's national floral emblem Australian Coat of Arms with the Golden Wattle design, 1921 Enthusiasm for wattles existed amongst naturalists in Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales, as well as in Victoria. Campbell's advocacy resulted in the formation in 1899 of a 'Wattle Club' in Victoria, to promote public interest in wattles and organise bush excursions on the first day of September every year.WorldWideWattle 2016, Wattle Day (1 September), Western Australian Herbarium and Department of Parks and Wildlife, Dalwallinu, Western Australia, Australia, accessed 29 Nov. 2017, http://worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/symbolic/wattleday.php. With the advent of Federation in 1901, Campbell began campaigning to have one of the wattle species, the Golden Wattle Acacia pycnantha, nominated as Australia's national floral emblem (in the same way as Ireland has the shamrock, Scotland the thistle, and so on). The matter was contentious - R.T.Baker campaigned just as hard for the flower of the Waratah Telopea speciosissima to be chosen. However, the Waratah has remained as the floral emblem of the state of New South Wales. The official proclamation concerning the Golden Wattle as emblem did not occur for many decades (during the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988) but on 19 September 1912 it was incorporated into the design which is still seen in the Coat of Arms, and was 'granted' under Royal Warrant by King George V.WorldWideWattle 2016, Australian coat of arms, Western Australian Herbarium and Department of Parks and Wildlife, Dalwallinu, Western Australia, Australia, accessed 29 Nov. 2017, http://worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/symbolic/coatofarms.php.Boden, A 1985, 'Golden wattles', Floral emblems of Australia, Australian National Herbarium, Canberra, ACT, Australia, accessed 15th Nov 2017, http://www.anbg.gov.au/emblems/aust.emblem.html. Efforts were made to unify the wattle-enthusiasts across Australian by creating the Wattle Federation of Australasia, inaugurated in Melbourne in January 1913, as reported in the Examiner, on Fri 17 Jan 1913, Page 7, in an article entitled 'The Wattle Federation': > Three delegates from each state were invited to attend the function, at > which the wattle federation was started.

The Prime > Minister (Right Hon. A. Fisher) presided at the inaugural dinner. - > Examiner, 1913 Another milestone was passed on 19 April 1984 when the wattle's green and gold colours became Australia's national colours. A formal proclamation was made by the Governor-General, Sir Ninian Stevens, that: \\"green and gold ... shall be the national colours of Australia for use on all occasions on which such colours are customarily used\\".WorldWideWattle 2016, Australian national colours: green and gold, Western Australian Herbarium and Department of Parks and Wildlife, Dalwallinu, Western Australia, Australia, accessed 29 Nov. 2017, http://worldwidewattle.com/infogallery/symbolic/nationalcolours.php. Following the 1988 official selection of the Golden Wattle as Australia's floral emblem, the final step of the journey that Campbell had begun in 1901 was taken when, in 1992, consensus was reached amongst the Commonwealth and all states and territories that the first day of Spring (1 September) should be Wattle Day throughout Australia.Wattle Day Association n.d., History of Wattle Day, Australian Choice, Canberra, ACT, Australia, accessed 29 Nov. 2017, https://www.australianchoice.com.au/page/wattle-day.aspx .  Photography  Camp View, Field Naturalists ' Club Expedition to King Island, 1887, by AJ Campbell Bertie's Hut, Field Naturalists ' Club Expedition to King Island, 1887, by AJ Campbell Much of the evidence for Campbell's innovative work as a photographer is held by Museum Victoria, having been donated by Campbell himself, on 22 December 1915: > This collection consists of 2,772 images taken by Archibald James Campbell. > These are made up of a combination of black and white prints and glass > negatives.

His photographs provide not only a demonstration of the state of the art of photography in the 1880s but also a detailed historical record of conditions for the pioneering naturalists, who were sometimes accompanied on their expeditions by wives and children. For example, two of Campbell's photographs of the 1887-1888 FNCV expedition to King Island, Tasmania show the accommodation on the near-uninhabited island. Only the family of the lighthouse keeper and one kangaroo hunter were on the island to lend assistance to the group during their nineteen-day visit. As Campbell relates, when provisions were depleted and they began to run out of flour \\"a little bran was mixed, to stay its rapid progress. As the flour became thinner so the bran increased; finally, the last \\" mash \\" was all bran.\\"Campbell, AJ 1888, 'Field Naturalists‚Äô Club of Victoria expedition to King Island, November, 1887: official report', The Victorian Naturalist, 4, 9, January 1888, p. 131.  Final years  Campbell family grave near Melbourne, in the St Kilda Cemetery, Presbyterian Compartment B, graves 132-134 Campbell is buried with six other members of his family. The plaque is headed: \\"Pioneers of 1839\\" After retiring from employment, in 1914, Campbell's life continued to be filled with activity and events. After the loss of his first wife, Elizabeth Melrose Anderson (1855-1915), Campbell married again, to Blanche Duncan (1870-1953), and took up residence in Box Hill (which was still a rural area at that time). He continued his expeditions and his writing, and one of his retirement projects was to prepare a new book of text and photographs entitled Golden wattle, our national floral emblem.Campbell , AJ 1921, Golden wattle, our national floral emblem, Osboldstone, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. He died on 12 September 1929, after having prepared a speech for the RAOU, which was read out posthumously. Campbell is buried in the cemetery in St. Kilda, in what has become a somewhat dilapidated grave. He lies in the company of his father Archibald James Campbell, his mother Catherine Pinkerton, his sister Catherine Jane Campbell, his first wife, Elizabeth Melrose Anderson, their daughter Elizabeth Victoria Campbell, and his second wife, Blanche Duncan.  Legacy  Besides the scientific associations that he helped to bring into existence and which still exist in one form or another, Campbell left a large body of written and photographic work. Some of the key texts are mentioned below: Articles: The FNCV journal the Victorian Naturalist has two notable articles from Campbell which later also appeared in the Australasian: * Campbell, AJ 1888, 'Field Naturalists Club of Victoria: expedition to King Island, 1887: official report', The Victorian Naturalist, 4, 129‚Äì135. * Campbell, AJ 1888, 'Field Naturalists Club of Victoria: expedition to King Island, 1887: narrative of the expedition', The Victorian Naturalist, 4, 146‚Äì162.

The neolithic Cortaillod culture was named after Cortaillod, where four neolithic villages have been discovered. History Cortaillod is first mentioned in 1311 as Cortaillot. Neolithic settlements Dates and locations of prehistoric Swiss cultures Cortaillod gave its name to the Cortaillod culture, a neolithic culture in Switzerland and surrounding areas. There are four neolithic sites along the lake shore at Cortaillod; La Fabrique or Le Vivier which is now eroding, Les Cotes which was almost completely washed out in 1880, Petit-Cortaillod and La Tuilli√®res. At La Tuilli√®res several large flint and stone axes were found. Petit-Cortaillod is the largest and most productive. It is about and is between thick. These sites were originally underwater, but were discovered when the water level of Lake Neuch√¢tel dropped. Because they were no longer flooded, between 1876 and 1879 the sites were looted. Many items were bought by museums or private collectors with limited study and documentation. The first scientific study was done in 1878 by Albert Vouga and Fritz Borel at the Petit-Cortaillod site. Their first excavations went down to a chalk layer at a depth of . The list of objects excavated on this occasion is impressive: thousands of flints and awls made of bone, 3,000 ax shafts, and about 2,000 smaller axes and hatchets. Bronze age settlements Bronze sword hilts from Cortaillod and Auvernier, (c. 1000-900 B.C.) Ferdinand Keller and Frederic Troyon reported the discovery of lake shore settlements from the Late Bronze Age (1250-800 BC) in 1858. Friedrich Schwab and Edouard Desor's archeological excavations found many bronze items. One of the most striking items, a wheel spoke made of bronze and oak wood with a diameter of , was discovered in 1862. Other finds included axes, sickles and needles as well as bronze swords and hundreds of vases. There were also a number of crescent-shaped earthenware objects called d'argile croissants. The d'argile croissants are about long and may represent constellations. After the first Jura water correction dropped the water levels by , the sites began to erode. In 1925 Paul Vouga took soundings to study the stratigraphy of the site. At his request, the Army made a series of aerial photographs in 1927, which provided a number of fundamental insights into these villages from the Bronze Age. Model of the Cortaillod-Est settlement The settlement at Cortaillod-Est was explored by divers in 1981-84. They were able to use dendrochronology to determine that the settlement was inhabited between 1010 and 955 BC. At its largest, it consisted of eight parallel rows of houses (total 22 houses), which were separated by straight-line paths. The houses were built on dry stone foundations. It was enclosed by a fence that was built in a semicircular arc and covered an area of about . Cortaillod-Plage, the extension of the village to the north-east was inhabited between 968-954 BC. The settlement was built on an area of approximately . The village of Cortaillod Les Esserts was surrounded by a long, three layer palisade. Cortaillod Les Esserts was inhabited between 870-850 BC and had an area of between . It had a road running through the center of the village with houses on both sides. La Fabrique or Le Vivier, the other Bronze Age site, is located above the Neolithic site. During the construction of the A1 motorway in 1993-98, the site was explored. In 1993 in Murgiers, two cremation graves from the Late Bronze Age (Hallstatt A 1) were discovered. One of the graves contained both offerings and a ceramic jar containing the cremated bones of a person. The other grave had fine pottery including vases with a decorative edge. The excavations at Petit Ruz in 1995-97 discovered many traces of a Bronze Age settlement, including some 300 post holes, numerous pits and hearths, and a gravel road. An excavation at Champ Basset in 1996 discovered a circular pit in diameter. This pit contained of very well preserved pottery from the Hallstatt period. Other sites in Cortaillod include postholes, burials, hearths and pottery at Tolay, in Champ Barrett, Rochettes in Chan√©laz and at Tilles as well as a number of tombs from the La T√®ne period at Courbes Rayes. Medieval town Part of Cortaillod was given in 1311 to Peter St√§ffis, Lord of Gorgier as a result of an exchange that he made with Count Rudolph IV of Neuch√¢tel. During the Middle Ages the ownership of the village was quite complicated. Members of the parishes of Pontareuse and Bevaix both lived there. The municipal community consisted of citizens of Boudry (who were under the Lord of Gorgier) and also subjects of the priory of Bevaix. Each feudal lord had a bailiff or magistrate to represent him in the village. There was only a civil court in Cortaillod, criminal cases were heard by one of the feudal lords. Starting in 1379 the inhabitants of the municipal community, owned their own pastures. In 1499 Philip of Hochberg, Count of Neuchatel, allowed them the right to farm the sandy shoreline. Between 1541 and 1545, the Lord of Colombier bought Cortaillod from the two preceding feudal lords. However, Cortaillod was sold to the Count of Neuch√¢tel in 1564, and became part of the County of Neuch√¢tel. The inhabitants then called themselves citizens of Boudry, but they did not enjoy all the citizenship rights. Early modern and modern Cortaillod The Fabrique-Neuve de Cortaillod opened in 1752 During the 15th to 19th centuries, there were repeated disputes between Cortaillod and the municipal community of Boudry. The disputes were over the division of the common pastures and forests and a special tax (Eminem de la porte), which had to be paid by the residents of Cortaillod but only benefited Boudry. This tax was abolished in 1813. In 1503, the Bishop of Lausanne allowed the villagers to establish a chapel. The Chapel of St. Nicholas was consecrated two years later. Until 1524 the pastor of Pontareuse and Bevaix protested against the permanent presence of a priest in Cortaillod. The village finally became an important parish when it accepted the Protestant Reformation. In 1537 it became an independent parish. The first weaving mill in Cortaillod opened in 1731 and was open for about 30 years. In 1752 the famous Fabrique-Neuve de Cortaillod mill opened near the other mills. It remained in operation until 1854. The building was then acquired in 1879 by C√¢bles Cortaillod. The company remained one of the most important companies in the municipality, even after it was acquired in 2001 by Nexans Schweiz AG. Between 1855 and 1885 there was a watch factory in Cortaillod. The European manufacturing and technology center of Silicon Graphics settled in Cortaillod in 1992. However, this plant, which employed about 300 people, closed in 2001.

It is found in the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea between below sea level. It is caught commercially in some countries. Description It can grow up to in length. It is left-eyed, has a slightly larger head than usual in flatfish, and with a narrower body than usual. The dorsal and ventral fins are relatively short and start far back on the body. The colouration is usually light brown with dark spots across the body and dark grey fins. It lacks the highly distinct dark spots found on the fins in its close relative, the four-spot megrim (L. boscii). Habitat The megrim prefers a sandy or muddy sea floor. They are predators and eat small fish and squid and also consume crustaceans. In turn megrim are themselves prey for larger species such as sharks, seals and large cod. Megrim spawn in deep waters off Iceland and the west of Ireland, while there is a separate spawning population in the Mediterranean. Range This species is found throughout European waters and the Northeast Atlantic including the Sea of the Hebrides.C.Michael Hogan, (2011) Sea of the Hebrides . Eds. P. Saundry & C.J.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC. Megrim are also found off the north coast of Africa and in parts of the Mediterranean. Commercial value Megrim are commercially valuable and are caught by a number of nations around Europe. It is caught by bottom trawling and is directly targeted in some fisheries, whereas in others it is retained as a valuable bycatch. France and Spain are the largest consumers of this species with most of the megrim caught in British water being exported to these nations. However, there has been a drive in Britain to get people to eat more megrim as a way of taking pressure off overexploited fish such as cod and haddock. Megrim can be cooked in a number of different ways with grilling, baking, frying and poaching all effective ways of preparing this species. In the UK megrim is sometimes given an alternative name such as megrim sole and Cornish sole as a way of making this species more appealing to consumers.

Uvalde (AKA-88) (formerly projected as the merchant freighter Wild Pigeon) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1188) on 27 March 1944 at Oakland, California, by the Moore Dry Dock Co.; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. George J. Kean; and commissioned on 18 August 1944, Lt. Comdr. William M. McCloy, USNR, in command. Service history=World War II, 1944-1945 After fitting out at Oakland, Uvalde ran her trials before departing San Francisco Bay on 29 August, bound for San Pedro, California She conducted extensive shakedown training out of that port before she shifted to San Diego, there to train in amphibious warfare from 15 through 30 September in company with the attack transport . In yard hands at Terminal Island, California, for post-shakedown availability until 10 October, Uvalde got underway and churned out of Los Angeles harbor, bound for San Francisco. Uvalde subsequently loaded cargo at that port from 11 through 19 October. =The destruction of Mount Hood= Departing \\"Frisco\\" on 20 October, Uvalde reached Manus, in the Admiralty Islands, on 6 November. Over the next few days, the ship lay at anchor in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, awaiting orders for onward routing. While there, she witnessed the volcanic explosion of the ammunition ship at 0820 on 11 November. Fortunately at a distance far enough away to be unaffected by the blast, Uvalde responded to the emergency by sending medical assistance and supplies to some of the other ships closer to where the ill-fated ammunition ship had been anchored ‚Äî ships that had taken heavy casualties when shrapnel from the atomized Mount Hood had ripped into them. Subsequently, three days after the Mount Hood tragedy, Uvalde got underway to unload cargo at East Murzim Dock. Completing that evolution a little over a week later, on the 21st, Uvalde got underway for New Guinea on the 29th, reaching Milne Bay, her destination, on 3 December. The attack cargo ship then took on board 100 tons of miscellaneous cargo earmarked for the 489th Port Battalion, Transportation Corps, 6th Army. She shifted to Oro Bay, New Guinea, within a few days, there loading additional cargo ‚Äî 1,025 tons of vehicles, gasoline, and organizational equipment for the 6th Army. On 21 December, Uvalde and her escort, got underway for the Admiralties, reaching their destination the following day. =Philippines campaign= Uvalde spent Christmas at Manus before she got underway on her first \\"mission of war\\" as part of Task Group (TG) 77.9 on 2 January 1945, shaping course for the island of Luzon. The attack cargo ship subsequently entered Lingayen Gulf on the morning of 11 January and, at 0925, sent her first wave of landing craft onto the beaches. During her ensuing stay at Lingayen Gulf, Uvalde's sailors witnessed their first attacks by the Japanese kamikazes on ships in the vicinity. On the 13th, Uvalde weighed anchor, shifting to Leyte and reaching there on the 16th. Two days later, the attack cargo ship got underway again, this time headed for the Schouten Islands. Bound for Biak, Uvalde reached her destination on the 23rd and commenced loading cargo at dock number 2 soon thereafter. Completing loading on 2 February, Uvalde returned to Leyte, joining formation with TG 78.5 on the following day. Subsequently anchoring in Leyte Gulf on the 6th, the attack cargo ship pushed on for Mindoro the following day, arriving on the 9th. Twenty-seven hours later, the ship completed the unloading evolution, receiving a \\"well done\\" from Capt. R. W. Abbott, the officer in tactical command of the task group. Uvalde returned to Leyte and, over the days that ensued, prepared for her next operation. For six weeks, the attack cargo ship participated in the practice evolutions that ultimately led up to the final big assault landing of the war in the Pacific ‚Äî the invasion of Okinawa in the Ry≈´ky≈´s. =Okinawa campaign= Underway on 27 March, Uvalde reached the assault areas on 1 April, the day of the initial landings. By noon of that day ‚Äì Easter Sunday ‚Äì the loading operations were proceeding apace. At 0559 on 2 April, Uvalde's gunners drew their first blood, downing a suicide aircraft making a run on the nearby attack transport . Uvalde received official credit for the kill ‚Äî she soon sported a miniature Japanese flag on her bridge. Off Okinawa from 1 April to 9 April, Uvalde spent much of her time at general quarters due to the heavy Japanese aerial resistance. The attack cargo ship subsequently weighed anchor on the 9th and headed to Saipan in the Marianas, en route to her ultimate destination. =The end of the war = After provisioning ship at Pearl Harbor, Uvalde returned to the western Pacific, departing the Hawaiian Islands on 10 May. Reaching Eniwetok in the Marshalls 10 days later, the attack cargo ship got underway for Guam in the Marianas after exchanging cargo and embarking passengers. Uvalde then discharged and unloaded at Guam before she proceeded for the west coast of the United States on 27 June, her course shaped for San Francisco. Uvalde arrived at the Golden Gate on 12 July, en route to Everett, Washington, for a drydocking and repairs. Reaching Everett on the 16th, the ship underwent nearly two weeks of repair work there, completing her assigned availability on 28 July. Departing the Pacific Northwest on 1 August, Uvalde proceeded to San Francisco to load cargo in preparation for her return to the western Pacific theater of operations. Completing the loading process on 11 August, the attack cargo ship got underway for the Hawaiian Islands on the 12th. She was at sea when at 1400 on 14 August 1945, President Harry S. Truman announced in a radio broadcast address that a state of war no longer existed between the United States and Japan. World War II was over at last. Post-war operations, 1944-1950 For Uvalde, the war had been a short one, but there still remained the duty of returning the many soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen home from the fighting fronts. The attack cargo ship took part in those operations well into 1946, also earning the Navy's Occupation Service Medal for operations in Chinese waters in ensuing months. Korean War, 1950-1953 Up until mid-1950, Uvalde transported troops and cargo to American outposts in Asia, supporting the United States presence in that area of the world Uvalde participated in the United Nations efforts to stem North Korean aggression after that nation invaded neighboring South Korea in June 1950, deploying to Korean waters with troops and cargo on numerous occasions. New Year's Day 1951 found Uvalde at Sasebo, Japan ‚Äì nine days later she got underway, bound for the west coast of the United States, and she reached her destination two weeks later on the 24th. Shifting to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for repairs and alterations on the 30th, the attack cargo ship remained in yard hands until early April, when she shifted to San Diego to conduct underway training evolutions. After three weeks of post-repair training, Uvalde shifted to the naval supply center at Oakland, California, when she loaded cargo earmarked for the Far East. The attack cargo ship subsequently made three round-trip voyages, touching at Sasebo and Yokosuka in the west and Oakland in the east over the remainder of 1951. Uvalde spent much of 1952 engaged in the same shuttle operations that had kept her occupied since the onset of the Korean War. She visited Korean waters in the latter half of the month of March 1952, touching at Sokcho Ri and Paengyong Do before resuming her west coast-to-Japan shuttle voyages with her termini at Oakland, Sasebo, and Yokosuka. During August,1952, the ship made a short recreational stop at Pearl Harbor. During the late autumn of 1952, Uvalde remained in Japanese waters, undergoing a drydocking at Yokosuka in late November before she sailed for Oakland on the 23rd of that month. Reaching Treasure Island, San Francisco, on 8 December, the attack cargo ship went into the naval shipyard at Mare Island three days later. Uvalde overhauled at Mare Island into mid-February, 1953, after which time she conducted the usual under way training evolutions before resuming west coast-to-Japan shuttle voyages. She called at Korean ports once, visiting Pohang in May 1953, spending most of her time in Japanese waters. Ports included during that cruise included Sasebo, Yokosuka, and Nagasaki. Pacific Fleet, 1954-1957 February through July of the following year, 1954, was spent in shuttle service between the Naval Supply Center, Oakland, and the Far East, with a recreational visit to Nagasaki in April. During July, the ship arrived at Yokosuka and, after a trip to Sasebo and return, loaded a cargo of rice and medical supplies, setting sail for French Indochina to assist in \\"Operation Passage to Freedom.\\" Uvalde reached Tourane Bay, French Indochina, on 28 August and remained there, supporting \\"Passage to Freedom\\" operations until 10 September, when she got underway to return to Oakland. Over the next few years, Uvalde's routine would remain much the same, sailing back and forth across the Pacific on the supply line from the west coast of the United States to American military bases in the Far East. Reserve and reinstatement, 1957-1961 Mothballed in 1957, and becoming a part of the Reserve Fleet, Uvalde was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1960, but was reinstated on 1 September 1961, because of the Berlin Crisis. Uvalde was recommissioned on 18 November 1961, Capt. C. A. Baldwin in command. Atlantic Fleet, 1957-1962 Ordered to duty with the Atlantic Fleet, the attack cargo ship ‚Äî with a new lease on life ‚Äî got underway for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and five weeks of training in December. After a voyage that had taken her via Mazatl√°n, Mexico; the Panama Canal; and Guantanamo (where she engaged in refresher training operations as scheduled), Uvalde reached her new assigned home port, Norfolk, Virginia, in February 1962. She thus became a part of the Amphibious Force of the Atlantic Fleet. After a post-shakedown overhaul, Uvalde took part in amphibious exercises at Vieques, Puerto Rico (Lant-PhibLex 1-62) in April ‚Äî her first major exercise since recommissioning. By the end of the year 1962, the veteran attack cargo vessel had deployed on various 2nd Fleet exercises and maneuvers in the western Atlantic and Caribbean areas. Attached to Amphibious Squadron (PhibRon) 10 from 22 October to 5 December, Uvalde supported the Fleet during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when President John F. Kennedy \\"quarantined\\" Cuba over the presence of offensive Soviet missiles on that strategic isle. Mediterranean, 1963-1968 Subsequently, Uvalde spent all of January 1963, engaged in pre- deployment upkeep. She sailed on 4 February, shaping course for the Mediterranean, and operated with the 6th Fleet through mid-May, touching at Naples, Italy; Athens, Greece; ƒ∞zmir, Turkey; Rhodes, Greece; Golfe Juan, France; and Barcelona, Spain; during the course of her operations. After returning to Norfolk for upkeep and independent ship exercises, Uvalde deployed to the Caribbean as part of the Amphibious Ready Squadron, calling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, during that cruise that carried over into late February 1964 as part of PhibRon 8. She deployed again to the Caribbean from late June to late September 1965, before she later participated in Exercise \\"Steel Pike I\\", during the latter cruise, she visited Gran Canaria, Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. Returning to her home port, Norfolk, in late November, Uvalde shifted to the New York Naval Shipyard, Brooklyn, New York, on 7 January. She remained there, undergoing repairs and alterations, until 28 April, after which time she headed south, ultimately conducting refresher training in Guantanamo Bay. In late June, Uvalde supported the American intervention in the Dominican Republic, serving as \\"bulk fuel control ship\\" between 18 June and 28 June. The ship then conducted independent exercises and underwent some needed upkeep through mid-July. Uvalde subsequently trained out of Little Creek, Virginia, for 10 days in July before resuming scheduled independent ship exercises and upkeep periods out of, and at, Norfolk. That autumn, she deployed to the Mediterranean for the second time as a unit of PhibRon 10. During that cruise ‚Äî lasting into mid-March 1966 ‚Äî Uvalde operated with Task Force 61, visiting Marseilles and Toulon, France; Malta; Naples, Genoa, and Livorno, Italy; Barcelona and Mazarron, Spain; and Porto Scudo and Santa Manza, Corsica. Reaching the end of the deployment, Uvalde left Palma, Majorca, in her wake on 17 March, bound for Rota, Spain, the turnover point, where she would be relieved of her duties with the 6th Fleet. She then began her homeward-bound voyage on 20 March, setting course for Morehead City, North Carolina. Midway across the Atlantic, Uvalde picked up distress signals from a Danish merchantman, the refrigerator ship SS Chilean Reefer. One of the freighter's crewmen was desperately ill and needed prompt medical attention ‚Äî care that the ship was apparently unable to supply. Uvalde immediately reversed course and sped to her assistance. The attack cargo ship took on board the patient, transferring him from Chilean Reefer in an LCM, where treatment commenced as soon as he came on board. The sailor remained on board to return to a hospital in the United States for treatment. Uvalde ultimately reached Morehead City and there disembarked her detachment of marines and off- loaded their equipment. Uvalde's crew, eager to continue on the homeward-bound leg of their voyage after the six-month Mediterranean cruise, worked all night to unload the ship so that the ship could sail the next morning, as soon as possible. Uvalde reached her home port, Norfolk, on 3 April 1966. As her commanding officer wrote in retrospect: \\"It was a good deployment, but it was even better to be back home again.\\" The attack cargo ship subsequently deployed to the Mediterranean two more times in her career, from April to August 1967 and again during the summer of 1968, returning to Morehead City, N.C., on 14 September and Norfolk the following day. She remained on active operations with the Atlantic Fleet into 1968. Decommissioning and sale Ultimately declared \\"unfit for further service\\", and replaced by a , with significant increases in combat vehicle and cargo stowage and better combat characteristics, Uvalde was decommissioned and struck from the Navy List on 1 December 1968. Transferred to the Maritime Administration on 26 June 1969 for disposal, Uvalde's hulk was simultaneously sold to Levin Metals Corp., of San Jose, California, and scrapped. Awards Uvalde earned one battle star for her World War II service and three for the Korean War. The anchor and bell of the USS Uvalde are displayed in Uvalde, Texas.

Alfre Woodard portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Captain America: Civil War (2016). Publication history Created by writer Mark Millar and artist Steven McNiven, she first made her appearance during the 2006 crossover event Civil War #1 as an anti-superhero protester modeled after activist Cindy Sheehan. Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada has stated that, at one point during the planning of Civil War, Miriam Sharpe was intended \\"to shoot Cap right after he puts his hands up to be handcuffed\\". Mark Millar has confirmed that Sharpe's concept came, in part, from Cindy Sheehan, although other statements have tied her creation to the four widows of firefighters from New Jersey who died during the September 11 attacks, and who pushed for the creation of the 9/11 Commission. Others point to Sharpe as representing public opinion in the Marvel Universe.\\"Mark Millar'S Civil War Post-Game Show\\", Newsarama Fictional character biography All that is known about Sharpe prior to the Civil War storyline that she was married; was a resident of Stamford, Connecticut; and had a young son named Damien who attended Stamford Elementary. Her son was at school the day that a fight between the New Warriors and several supervillains destroyed much of Stamford, including the elementary school. After her son's death, Sharpe became the most powerful voice in the emerging Pro-Registration Movement, demanding the government pass the Superhuman Registration Act (SHRA). At a memorial service for the victims of the Stamford attack, Sharpe had a highly publicized confrontation with Tony Stark where she accused the Avengers' benefactor of being there just to \\"play hero\\". It was this confrontation with Sharpe that convinced Stark to also champion the Registration Act as Iron Man. However, Stark had in fact already been covertly supporting Registration Act even before the Stamford disaster. Sharpe is widely noted by pundits as a brilliant political operator. In the weeks following the Stamford disaster, she managed to create a support base that would gather hundreds to march on the White House, influence superhumans, and eventually convince Congress and the president to pass the superhuman registration act.Millar, Mark (w), McNiven, Steven (p), Vines, Dexter (i).

It stands at the head of the Mosedale Horseshoe with its back to Ennerdale. Paths lead to Scoat Fell from Ennerdale over Steeple, from Wasdale over Red Pike, and along the ridge from Pillar. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Scoat Fell is on the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The principal fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell, followed by the lower Lank Rigg group. Scoat Fell occupies an important position at the crossroads of five ridges. To the east, across the subsidiary top of Black Crag, is Pillar. Southward is a long descending ridge heading toward the shore of Wastwater. The high point is Red Pike, before the terminal height of Yewbarrow. The main watershed continues west to Haycock, while two short spurs jut north into Ennerdale. These are Tewit How which descends from the western end of the plateau and Steeple, running from the summit. As the radial point of so many ridges Scoat Fell forms the head of several valleys, the major ones being the Wasdale feeders of Mosedale and Nether Beck. Mosedale begins on the eastern flanks of Scoat Fell, between Red Pike and Pillar, in the hollow of Black Comb. There are crags in the headwall, particularly to the south. Nether Beck has its birth at Scoat Tarn, a large pool to the south of the fell. This corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines is around 65 ft deep.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Between Steeple and Pillar to the north is Windgap Cove with Black Crag, a Hewitt at its head. Wind Gap is the col between Black Crag and Pillar, while the small Mirk Cove lies between Black Crag and the summit. Finally Mirklin Cove is the corrie between Steeple and Tewit How, drained into Ennerdale by Low Beck. All of the northern coves are home to impressive crags. Of Scoat Fell's various satellites, Little Scoat Fell and Black Fell are generally considered to be a part of the parent fell, while Steeple, despite its clearly derivative position, is counted as a separate fell. This is due to its impressive appearance from Ennerdale rather than any great relative height, a triumph of the emotions over logic. Geology Successive rock strata are displayed along the descending ridge of Tewit How to the north west, displaying the architecture of the fell. At the top is the plagioclase-phyric andesite lava of the Birker Fell Formation, followed by the siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, tuff and lapilli-tuff of the Eagle Crag Member. Further outcrops of the Birker Fell Formation are followed by a band of dacite before the igneous rocks of the Ennerdale Intrusion complete the picture.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Summit The top is a long plateau, running broadly east to west. Along it runs the stone wall of the Ennerdale fence, crossing the summit exactly. Purists have built a small cairn atop the wall, although a larger edifice lies just to the north, pointing the way to Steeple. The whole area is stony, with fine views into the northern coves. Ordnance Survey maps label the summit as Little Scoat Fell and a small hillock at the western end of the plateau as Great Scoat Fell. These names are based on area rather than height, Great Scoat Fell being 130 ft lower. Pillar reduces the field of view, without showing its better side, but almost the full horseshoe of the Western Fells can be seen. The wall makes it difficult to observe the full panorama from one point. Ascents From Ennerdale many walkers will ascend indirectly via Steeple, but the ridge of Tewit How can also be used. Wasdale Head can be used as a base, first walking up Mosedale and then climbing up to the ridge via Black Comb. Finally Nether Beck Bridge on the shore of Wastwater provides access via Scoat Tarn onto the southern flanks. From the upper recesses of Nether Beck the walker can aim for either of the cols which connect the objective to Red Pike or Haycock. Perhaps the greatest number of visitors will cross the top as part of the Mosedale Horseshoe, also climbing Red Pike and Pillar.Bill Birkett:Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Nuttalls Hewitts of England Fells of the Lake District Borough of Copeland ","title":"Scoat Fell"},{"id":"6295180","text":"Fresens is a former municipality in the district of Boudry in the canton of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland.

Pressler was voted ACC Coach of the Year three times and also was honored as the USILA National Coach of the Year in 2005. He was fired in 2006 in the wake of allegations of rape against three athletes in the program that proved to be baseless. Pressler's firing was publicly portrayed by Duke as a resignation, which gave rise to the implication that the coach resigned due to the students' presumed guilt. Pressler believed the players were innocent and had argued that the lacrosse season should not be canceled until the DNA test results were returned. Pressler has written (with co-author Don Yaeger) a book giving his view of the incident, It's Not About the Truth: The Untold Story of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case and the Lives It Shattered. Pressler demanded compensation from Duke for wrongful termination. In early June 2007, Pressler and Duke agreed upon a financial settlement for an undisclosed amount. Then in October 2007, Pressler filed suit against Duke, alleging the university broke the terms of the confidential settlement. Pressler asserted that Duke broke the terms of the settlement when he was slandered by Duke senior vice president John Burness, who made disparaging comments about him, saying the difference between Pressler and the current lacrosse coach was \\"night and day.\\" The suit sought to void the settlement and to pursue damages in a trial rather than by arbitration, as specified in his contract. The trial judge ruled for Pressler's claims, and was upheld by the Court of Appeals on September 1, 2009. Pressler's obligation to submit his claims to arbitration was voided by the June settlement. Pressler was free to proceed with his suit, including discovery. On March 31, 2010, the final day before discovery would start, Duke settled with Pressler. Although terms of the settlement were not disclosed, Duke issued an apology.

It originally ran for three series plus three Christmas specials, and was produced by Optomen Television for the BBC. The show was Oliver's television debut, and was noted for its use of jumpy, close-up camera work, and the presenter's relaxed style‚Äîfor example, Oliver would tear up herbs rather than chopping. The programme was credited with inspiring men to cook due to Oliver's \\"blokey\\" approach. Each episode took its theme from a social situation or event in Oliver's life, such as a hen night or babysitting. In series 1 and 2 (except the Christmas specials), Jamie was filmed cooking at his home (paid for by the BBC). In series 3, the kitchen locations shifted to other venues.

It is governed by Asansol Municipal Corporation History Dihika was made famous by Paramahansa Yogananda who came here in 1917 to set up a \\"How-to-Live\\" school with only seven students and a couple of teachers. Yogananda \\"had long nurtured the dream of setting up a residential school where students would be imparted moral and spiritual lessons apart from formal and vocational training.\\" In 1916 Yogananda met Sri Manindra Chandra Nundy, the then Maharaja of Kashimbazar, who also wanted to create such a school. \\"It was decided that the Ashram-School would begin in an estate bungalow in Dihika, a lonely hamlet by the river Damodar, some 10 km from Asansol. The area was the property of Sri Nundy who agreed to bear most of the expenses of the initial batch of seven students. At the behest of Sri Yukteswar, the school was inaugurated on March 22, 1917, the auspicious occasion of the (Spring) equinox. A local attorney was invited to preside over the ceremonial rituals held in a serene and tranquil ambiance. Thus was sown the seed of a life-long mission that blossomed in later years to draw millions of God-seeking people with its fragrance. Dihika Ashram School, 1917 In those days Dihika was a forlorn place where nature was in attendance with all her bounties. The one-story school building was situated on a land that was a few feet above the surrounding area. A forest consisting mainly of Sals stood only a little distance away from the school. The river, Damodar, could be seen flowing gently in its silent serpentine way. A range of hills appeared like silhouettes in the distance. Huts of local villagers dotted the place and above all these mortal bodies there lay a vast expanse of blue sky with all its magnanimity. As if, a Gurukul from the times of Vedic India had been installed by a magic wand. The quiet ambiance and the serenity was rarely broken when a train slowly whistled its way to its destination. Sri Nundy, after visiting the school burst into exhilaration and named it The School of Divinity.\\" In 1918 Yogananda moved the fast-growing school to Ranchi, through the generosity of Sir Nundy. Yogananda called the school Yogoda Satsanga Brahmacharya VidyalayaAutobiography of a Yogi, Chapter 27. Self-Realization Fellowship (Founded by Yogananda) http://www.yogananda-srf.org/ In 1997, a piece of this land encompassing the pond was purchased by Yogoda Satsanga Society of India (YSS), the spiritual organization that Paramahansa Yogananda founded in 1917. Yogoda Satsanga Dhyana Kendra-Dihika has been functioning from this place since then. In 1920, Sri Yogananda was sent by his Guru Sri Yukteswar Giri to share with the West the philosophy of Yoga and its tradition of meditation. It was then that he founded Self-Realization Fellowship(SRF), the sister organization to YSS. He was the first Hindu teacher of yoga to make his permanent home in America, living there from 1920‚Äî1952. Geography Dihika is located at . This village is located on the north bank of Damodar River. The Asansol region is composed of undulating laterite region. This area lies between two mighty rivers, namely, the Damodar and the Ajay. They flow almost parallel to each other in the region, the average distance between the two rivers is around 30 km. For ages the area was heavily forested and infested with plunderers and marauders. The discovery of coal led to industrialisation of the area and most of the forests have been cleared.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, pp 14-15, Radical Impression.

In the 19th century, the lake was an important source of ice for export, especially to Britain. Wenham Lake is now a reservoir for the Salem and the Beverly Water Supply Board.  Hydrology  The lake receives water from the water table and from nearby streams. These flow from Beaver Pond, Norwood Pond and Longham Reservoir through the fields and woods to the east of the lake. The streams are controlled waterways. Drainage into the lake is through a pipe running beneath Route 1A in the vicinity of the golf course to the north of the lake. To the west, near Beverly Regional Airport water enters the lake through deeply cut ravines in glacial features forested with hemlock and pine.  History  Wenham Lake lies in the traditional lands of the Agawam people. The Agwam people recognised tribal ownership of the eastern part of what is now Essex County, Massachusetts. Those lands were ceded to the English in a quitclaim deed made by Chief Masconomet to John Winthrop the Younger. The deed was part of an amalgamation arrangement between remaining Agawam (whose numbers had markedly declined in the 1600s due to disease) and the English colonists of Charlestown, Massachusetts. Wenham Lake is first found under the name \\"Great Pond\\", in the records of Salem, Massachusetts.The lake was the site of the murder of John Hoddy by John Williams. Hoddy's dog detained Williams until his arrest. In 1638, Hugh Peters, the Puritan minister of the First Church of Salem, delivered a sermon to a small group of settlers on the shore of Wenham Lake. His sermon turned upon \\"Enon, near Salem, because there was much water there\\", a biblical reference to . A small settlement nearby was thus named \\"Enon\\". The site of the sermon is marked by a stone with an engraved plaque. Enon was officially recognized by the General Court of Massachusetts on November 5, 1639. On May 10, 1643, Enon was incorporated and renamed Wenham. The lake was then named Wenham Lake. In 1846, Benjamin Barker wrote Mornilva, or the outlaw of the forest: a romance of Lake Wenham. He described the lake's \\"clear, calm and placid waters, the beautiful and picturesque hills upon its borders, the beautiful evergreen of its dusky pine woods, and above all, the blue canopy of heaven, which overshadows it.\\" Barker B. Mornilva, or the outlaw of the forest: a romance of Lake Wenham Gleason's Publishing Hall, 1846 p7. Accessed at Google Books 31 May 2017. In 1877, the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier wrote \\"The Witch of Wenham\\" which was set on the shores of Wenham Lake. In the early 1900s, the ornithologist and hunter John Charles Phillips published, \\"Wenham Great Pond\\" recounting his time over ten years at Wenham Lake.  Historic uses = Alewife fishing  In the early colonial times, alewife fishing was an important part of the local economy of Wenham. All the ponds in the region were interconnected through swamps and streams. Wenham Lake was a major alewife spawning ground. The alewife entered the lake via an outlet that emptied into the Miles River. The Miles river joins the Ipswich River giving a drop in elevation of about . Alewife harvests continued to be important until the 19th century when dam construction on the Ipswich River and other streams ended the trade. The water of the lake was used to supply a mill via a dam.Allen (1860), pages 17-21. The outlet was later filled by the roadbed of Route 1A and the land used for the Lakeview Golf Course. Similarly, all the ponds have been protected as part of the drinking water supply.  Ice export  The transatlantic ice trade began in the 1840s. In 1844, the first ice cargo arrived in England from Wenham Lake. The ice of Wenham Lake became famous around the world.Smith P. C. F. Crystal blocks of Yankee coldness Ice Harvesting USA website. Accessed 31 May 2017. It was especially popular in Britain because of its purity and it is even said that Queen Victoria used the ice.Wenham Lake Lori Ehrlich website. Ice from Wenham Lake was so popular that Norwegian ice exporters even renamed the Norwegian Lake Oppeg√•rd for a short while into Wenham Lake so that they could trade ice from this Norwegian lake as ice from Wenham Lake. The Landers family, owners of the lake's first ice house, constructed a railroad spur for ice transport. One of its builders of the railroad was Grenville Mullen Dodge. He became a Major General in the Union Army and a central figure in the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869. The railroad spur became the Beverly- Newburyport commuter rail line. The roadbed of the railroad spur is visible directly behind the fifth hole of the Lakeview Golf Course. A crew of 100 men and 30 to 40 horses was required to harvest the ice. The crew waited for a foot of black ice to form in the lake. Snow was swept off and snow-ice was scraped off by horse-drawn vehicles if necessary. Then, a horse-drawn cutting tool, the marker, scored a grid 2-3 inches deep forming 21-inch squares over two to three acres of ice. Men with saws cut along a line in one direction while men with ice spades knocked the blocks free from the strip. Another crew with ice hooks drew the ice along ramps onto platforms. Full platforms were slid onto sledges for transport to ice houses on the shore. An ice house was built of pine walls filled with sawdust to a thickness of . The blocks were packed in sawdust for transport, moved to a train in a special wagon and brought directly to a wharf in Boston. The blocks arrived in Boston within an hour of the cutting with no loss. Transport to Britain by ship lost about a third of the ice. The ice business continued until at least 1912 when John C. Kelleher founded the Beverly Ice Company to harvest the lake's ice but its end came shortly afterwards.  Modern uses = Water supply  Wenham Lake was set aside as a water reservoir for the Salem and Beverly Water Supply Board (established 1913). Wenham Lake has been integrated into the local water distribution system.  Recreation  The lake and its shores are not accessible to the general public. Facilities at the southern end are restricted by high fences and kept under surveillance by cameras. The shores of the lake are posted against trespassing. Stands of evergreens left on the knolls surrounding the lake are privately owned. Due to the isolation of the lake bed, migratory birds that were only seen in Wenham Swamp, a mile to the north, now rest and feed in larger numbers in the lake. Even though it is a non-trespassing area, most locals see it as one of the most consistent fishing places in northern Massachusetts. Environment In 2001, the Wenham Lake Watershed Association discovered significant contamination of the lake with large deposits of fly ash dating from the 1950s and 1960s. These deposits totalled about 7,800 cubic yards and were more than 3 feet deep in some places. The origin of the fly ash was the nearby Vitale dump. The dump was an abandoned gravel and sand quarry that had illegally stored refuse from coal burned at the Salem Harbor Power Generating Station. In subsequent years the lake has been dredged and is monitored for its long-term health.

The album was re-released in 2007 on Anton Newcombe's A Records. \\"Wisdom\\" was later re-recorded on the band's first and only album with TVT Records, Strung Out in Heaven. \\"Wisdom\\", \\"She's Gone\\", \\"That Girl Suicide\\" and \\"Evergreen\\" were included on the band's greatest hits compilation Tepid Peppermint Wonderland: A Retrospective.  Critical reception  Methodrone was largely ignored upon its release, but managed to garner a favorable review in CMJ New Music Monthly, with Brian Bannin writing: \\"Everything moves with the slowness and presence of a disgraced monarch in exile... At its best, Methodrone has the tormented grace of accepting doom\\". In 2018, Pitchfork ranked Methodrone at number 33 on its list of \\"The 50 Best Shoegaze Albums of All Time\\".

Classic Creep Capers is an adventure game published by THQ for the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color, based on the Hanna-Barbera cartoon Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!. The Nintendo 64 version, developed by Terraglyph Interactive Studios, was released in November 2000, while the Game Boy Color version was developed by Digital Eclipse Software, and released in February 2001. A PlayStation version, identical to the Nintendo 64 version, had been in development by Terraglyph Interactive Studios but was cancelled. Gameplay=Nintendo 64 version The game follows the Mystery Inc. investigating a crime ring run by a mysterious ghoul king through four levels. The first three levels retell three episodes of Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while the fourth is an original mystery. The player controls Shaggy and Scooby as they find clues and trap pieces to complete the levels. Velma, Fred, and Daphne assist them. When Shaggy is scared enough times, he leaves the area and the player must restart. The fright can come from simple things such as the opening of a mummy's case or complex dangers such a moving dinosaur display hitting the player. 'Courage' can be restored by finding food to eat in a cafeteria or in Scooby Snacks lying on the ground. Each room, or sometimes different sections of the same room, are presented as unmoving camera shots that the player moves through. Familiarity with the television show helps the player, as in one instance, the player must hide inside a two-dimensional painting to escape a villain. The Villains are Black Knight, Snow Ghost, The Witch Doctor, and the game exclusive Ghoul King. Game Boy Color version The Game Boy Color version features the gang trying to solve the case of the ghost of Dr. Jekyll. The player controls all members of the gang. The Mystery Machine had run out of gas in front of the Jekyll Mansion. The gang goes through each area of the mansion and the lab. The player must pick up items for later use, such as a stool, a sausage, and a book with the code to get into the lab. The gang, except Shaggy and Scooby, investigates the mansion to look for clues. When Fred and Daphne see the ghost walk through a door, they go in to investigate. The ghost has vanished and Daphne is curious about a device called a \\"Tele- Pot,\\" a teleporting toilet. Daphne disappears and is captured by Dr. Jekyll. Fred is worried and Velma studies the symbols in the house with the help of a book she found. She opens the door using a code from the book. Fred goes in to find Daphne and Velma decides to return the book. Fred is captured by robot guards that look like Shaggy and are locked away. He thinks Shaggy has gone mad and has mutinied. Shaggy and Scooby are hungry and go inside to look for food. They find a wall of cheese. They eat it and find a way to fix the levers for the library. Shaggy and Scooby go to the lab and find the robot guards. They search for items needed to make a disguise. They succeed, shut down one of the guards, and sabotage Mr. Hyde's experiment on Daphne. Shaggy and Scooby save Fred and help save Daphne. When the members of the gang are reunited, Fred makes a plan to trap the ghost. Velma rigs the clock to chime and then the ghost appears and chases Shaggy and Scooby. When Velma sees Shaggy and Scooby run to the ballroom, she throws a towel to the laundry room to signal Fred to hit the breaker and turn off the power. With the power out the ghost slips and is caught in a net. The ghost is revealed to be Dr. Jekyll, stealing jewelry to finance his projects. He originally used cheese to power his robot staff, until Helga, his maid, discovered him. He then used a Tesla coil to power his staff. Shaggy finds gas for the Mystery Machine, and the gang sends Jekyll to jail and head home. Development Scooby-Doo! Classic Creep Capers was publicly announced in May 2000, with three levels that would each be based on three episodes of the original Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! series, - \\"What a Night for a Knight\\", \\"That's Snow Ghost\\", and \\"A Tiki Scare is No Fair\\" as well as a fourth level featuring an original story. At that time, a PlayStation version was in development by Terraglyph Interactive Studios, but was cancelled. Like the Nintendo 64 version, the PlayStation version also would have been based on the same three episodes of the series, as well as featuring a new story for its fourth level. The Game Boy Color version, announced in June 2000, was developed by Digital Eclipse Software, with its release date initially scheduled for fall 2000. Nintendo 64 The Nintendo 64 version was developed by Terraglyph Interactive Studios. Development began in late fall 1999. To ensure that the game would have a style similar to the series, the developers worked closely with Hanna-Barbera and Warner Bros., and repeatedly watched dozens of old episodes of the series. Three episodes were chosen to be adapted into the game as levels, while an original story was created by the developers to serve as the fourth level of the game. Original 2D art from Hanna-Barbera was used for the game's characters and environments. The developers faced difficulty in creating perfect 3D models of the characters, which had previously only been seen in 2D form on television. Although backgrounds on the series were simple, the developers used highly detailed environments for the game, while ensuring that they still looked like settings from the series. Scott Innes, who was voice actor for Scooby and Shaggy at that time, provided his voice for the characters in the game. The original theme song from Scooby-Doo, Where Are You! was recreated for the game. The rest of the game's music meant to be similar to music from the series was created exclusively for the game. Because violence was never featured in the Scooby-Doo franchise, the game's designers had difficulty designing the gameplay in a way so that the player would have to either hide from enemies or move past them, rather than fight them. Various jokes from the series were implemented into the game. Development had concluded by October 2000, at which point the game was in Nintendo's final approval process. Reception Classic Creep Capers was met with average to mixed reception upon release. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 71% for the Game Boy Color version, and 59.33% and 53 out of 100 for the Nintendo 64 version. IGN gave the N64 version a score of 4.8 out of 10 overall. The sound was criticized for a lack of authentic voice-overs and the graphics were blurry on the low resolution screen. However, IGN gave the GBC version a warmer review, rating it 7 out of 10.

Storylines Tony arrives in Walford from Norfolk on 7 September 1995 with his sister, Sarah Hills (Daniella Denby-Ashe). He is unsympathetic and sells ecstasy with a friend, Dan Zappieri (Carl Pizzie). Eventually, he quits dealing after Dan gives Sarah ecstasy without her knowledge. Tony begins a relationship with Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon) and lives with her for a while. She becomes pregnant and the baby is assumed to be Tony's. However, Tiffany catches him kissing her brother Simon (Andrew Lynford), with whom he then starts a relationship, and the baby is revealed to be Grant Mitchell's (Ross Kemp). Tony still believes the baby may be his until, after it is born, a paternity test confirms he is not the father. Tony and Simon have a turbulent relationship, and Tony has affairs with Frankie Pierre (Syan Blake), a singer, and Polly Becker (Victoria Gould), a journalist at the Walford Gazette, where Tony is a trainee. Simon discovers the affairs and the couple split up. Tony's experiments with ecstasy and general pro-drug attitudes cause him to once say \\"no-one ever died from taking E\\". He has a relationship with Teresa di Marco (Leila Birch), but after Tiffany dies and Simon nearly burns to death in a house fire, Tony reconciles with Simon. Simon has trouble accepting that Tony is bisexual rather than gay, but Tony convinces Simon that he is the one he wants and they leave Albert Square together in April 1999 to travel around Europe. A letter sent to Tony's family reveals the couple have settled in Amsterdam. Development Homer's departure from EastEnders was announced in late 1998, along with that of his co-star Andrew Lynford. They both decided to leave following discussions with the executive producer Matthew Robinson, and a spokesperson for the programme said \\"They have mutually agreed that both characters have fulfilled their potential and will conclude their stories with a dramatic exit.\\" Their departures left only one gay character in the UK's mainstream soap operas, that of Zoe Tate in Emmerdale. Gay campaigning group Stonewall's spokesman Matt Aston commented on this, saying: \\"Gay characters did seem to be on the rise for a while, but now they've got a bit of a low profile. We'd like to see a few more positive role models in the media, especially to encourage young people who are coming to terms with their sexuality, as well as their friends and members of their family.\\" However, Aston praised the way Tony's sexuality was handled, saying, \\"It was very good for breaking what had been a taboo on prime-time television. It was a positive portrayal of how people can be confused about their sexuality. And as with any kind of exposure of these issues, people are made more aware of them and the problems people have with their sexuality. People also link them with us and get in touch to talk about it.\\" EastEnders first gay kiss attracted criticism, but it was noted that by the time Tony and Simon had their first kiss, \\"fewer feathers were left to be ruffled.\\" Reception Author Margaret Llewellyn- Jones has suggested that Simon and Tony were two of the \\"straight-est-looking gay boys in London\\". She suggested that they were not convincing to the gay audience, which she argued was because \\"the gayness of the characters was 'clawed-back' and that the readers of the image who see them as unconvincing use a queer reading practice. The two gay characters are signified within codes of recognition that are available to the central reader. To the queer reader they can be seen clearly as a rather dubious construction - they are a carbon copy of a 'straight' relationship where only the object of desire is different, rather than a relationship that signs itself as different. To a queer reader the gay relationship in this instance says nothing to them other than a representation of a straight relationship, what it does show is the implicit constructedness of all of the relationships present in a soap's fabric.\\" See also *List of fictional journalists *List of LGBT characters in television and radio References EastEnders characters Fictional bisexual males Television characters introduced in 1995 Fictional drug dealers Fictional reporters Fictional LGBT characters in television Male characters in television ","title":"Tony Hills"},{"id":"6295444","text":"Indoctrinate U is a 2007 American feature-length documentary film written by, directed by and starring Evan Coyne Maloney, that examines controversial topics like equality and fairness, diversity, ideological conformism and political correctness in American institutions of higher education. Film content Maloney argues that while students involved with the \\"campus free speech movement\\" of the 1960s nobly and successfully defended the rights of students to think and express and freely share ideas, their message subsequently devolved into one that allows only their viewpoints to be heard. The film portrays incidents where minority critics of controversial policies such as affirmative action, like political activist and former University of California Regent Ward Connerly, are shouted off stage or otherwise have their views marginalized, seemingly without real consideration - often simply by likening them to Nazis or Klansmen to delegitimize them entirely; or how students at Cal State San Bernardino and at other schools across the nation trying to illustrate the inherent racism of affirmative action by holding \\"affirmative action bake sales\\" are ironically reprimanded for expressing \\"hate speech\\". Clips of anti-military protests at UC Santa Cruz and San Francisco State University at one point show how protestors demanded that recruiters from the Army Corps of Engineers leave the school's career fair, with such fervor that it led the cancellation of the entire event. Also shown is the treatment of conservative students at the University of Tennessee and Cal Poly. Also included are the racial and ethnic politics at the University of Michigan and Yale, teaching at Duke and Columbia; interviews with David French and Greg Lukianoff, (then respectively president and director of legal and public advocacy at the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), Glenn Reynolds, Daniel Pipes, Carol Miller Swain, and others. Production=Filming Maloney spent two and a half years making the documentary by conducting interviews on various college campuses and with various thinkers. The film was preceded by two shorter versions, Brainwashing 101 and Brainwashing 201: The Second Semester. The two shorts led the 2004 American Film Renaissance festival to select Indoctrinate U as its \\"most anticipated documentary.\\" Indoctrinate U was produced by On the Fence Films with the support of the Moving Picture Institute, and Stuart Browning, Blaine Greenberg, and Thor Halvorssen. The film's executive producers are Stuart Browning and Blaine Greenberg. Its associate producer is Frayda Levy. It was edited by Chandler Tuttle. In March 2007, Maloney appeared on Hannity's America to discuss the film. On April 19 of the same year, he appeared on C-SPAN's Washington Journal where they showed clips from the film and took calls. Lawsuit and website closure On November 13, 2007, the official website was taken down and replaced with a notice that read: \\"Due to threatened legal action from a major taxpayer-funded university, we've temporarily taken down the Indoctrinate U homepage while we assess our options.\\" The website was back up by December 4. Maloney explained in a statement that Indiana University claimed there was a similarity between the university's logo and that of the film's. The Indoctrinate U logo was changed and the website resumed operation. In a note to the Wall Street Journal, Maloney emphasized his ready compliance with IU's demands, saying that while he was confident that the film's logo was not an infringement of IU's rights to their own logo, as the differences of the two are \\"readily apparent\\", as well as the fact that \\"there is also no likelihood of consumer confusion because our product is a film whereas theirs is four years in Bloomington.\\" It was decided that it was simpler to comply with the demands than to fight them, particularly because the logo had little bearing on the film itself. Maloney says that he became more confused when, after the dispute was settled, Indiana University (which doesn't appear in the film) demanded a sum of money from the production company - which Maloney and others viewed as an attempt to bankrupt the company and silence him. Reviews A review in The Weekly Standard said, \\"The documentary combines relatively shocking footage (one professor excitedly tells the camera \\"whiteness is a form of racial oppression . . . treason to whiteness is loyalty to humanity\\") with snappy editing to create a documentary that bounces quickly from subject to subject.\\" Examples of \\"intellectual thuggery\\" in the film are nothing more than \\"the tip of a disgusting iceberg\\", laments Walter E. Williams, noting that \\"Several university officials refused to be interviewed for the documentary. They wanted to keep their campus policies under wraps, not only from reporters but parents as well.\\"Academic Cesspools by Walter E. Williams, October 17, 2007Academic Cesspools II by Walter E.

After releasing Take It from the Man! and Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request in mid-1996, both of which display influences from 1960s psychedelic music, departing from the band's earlier shoegaze sound, the band recorded Thank God for Mental Illness through \\"tangible custom lo-fi stereo\\" in their San Francisco home studio on July 11, 1996 with the budget of $17.36. The album shows another musical palette for the group, taking influence from country blues and psychedelic folk music, with one review calling it \\"an incredibly strange acoustic venture.\\" The album is divided into two parts; the first part features mostly acoustic lo-fi songs of a short length, whilst the other half is a series of songs and pieces merged into one track named \\"Sound of Confusion\\", that features both regular songs and more abstract sound collages. Released on October 25, 1996 by record label Bomp!, it was the third and final full-length album released by the band in that year. The album title was lead singer Anton Newcombe's personal jab at personal insults towards himself. The album was critically acclaimed and was hailed for, among numerous points, its lo-fi quality and influences. Several critics drew out comparisons to Bob Dylan. The album has since been hailed as one of the band's greatest, and Newcombe's own record label A Records re- released the album on CD in 2007 and on LP in 2016, the latter marking the first time it was issued on LP.  Background and recording  After spending 1995 signing to Bomp! Records and releasing their debut album Methodrone, which featured a shoegazing-influenced style, and re-releasing Spacegirl & Other Favorites, a collection of the band's earliest recordings from 1993, the group changed their direction considerably, and under the influence of 1960s British rock and psychedelic music, recorded Take It from the Man! and Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request respectively from 1995‚Äì1996, both of which were then released in mid-1996. Becoming their most prolific year for releases, the group decided to record a third album for release in 1996, again showing a different influence, namely from folk music, although again presenting it in a psychedelic style. Self-produced by band leader Anton Newcombe, the entire album was recorded on July 11, 1996 \\"live\\" in the band's home studio in San Francisco, California; the studio is referred to in the liner notes as \\"Our House.\\" The album only cost $17.36 to record, a sum that Newcombe paid for entirely. The liner notes state the album was recorded in \\"tangible lo-fi custom stereo\\" in order to \\"keep the faith.\\" The very small budget has entered legendary status, with Tiny Mix Tapes recalling of the recording sessions:  Music and lyrics  Marking another direction for the band, Thank God for Mental Illness has been described as an acoustic-based, psychedelic lo-fi album taking strong influences from country, blues, and folk. Jason Ankeny of AllMusic described the album as \\"the BJM's down-and- dirty country-blues outing\\", whilst the Phoenix New Times called it a \\"blusey, acoustic folk album,\\" and SF Weekly described it as an \\"incredibly strange acoustic venture.\\" Wondering Sound agreed the album was \\"country-tinged\\" and said it allowed the band to pioneer \\"a malevolent and incendiary take on psychedelic rock, one that located a sinister undercurrent in the hippy dream and coaxed it to the surface.\\" Under the Radar described the album as \\"Dylan- esque,\\" whilst Pitchfork Media more specifically described Newcombe's performance on the album as \\"busker-Dylan esque.\\" In his interview with Newcombe, Ben Vendetta from Vendetta Mag observed a folk rock influence on the album, noting that he does \\"go off in different directions\\" on his records; Newcome agreed although adding \\"but its all psychedelic, you know what I mean? Its all being psychedelic.\\" Debaser detected another influence in \\"the roots of the Californian rock of the sixties,\\" noting the possible influence of Skip Spence, Quicksilver Messenger Service and acid rock. Newcombe's singing is often plaintive through the album, with \\"mawkish synthetic texts.\\" The album is divided into two parts; the first part features mostly acoustic lo-fi songs of a short length, described by one reviewer as \\"loose bohemian tunes,\\" whilst the other half is a series of songs and pieces merged into one track named \\"Sound of Confusion\\", that features both regular songs and more abstract sound collages. The first seven minutes is the sound of passing cars, described by one reviewer as \\"motorway sound effects,\\" and an incoherent religious chant performed by Newcombe, followed in other places by \\"electrical delirium\\". Debaser said that \\"Sound of Confusion\\" is to the band what \\"Sister Ray\\" is to the Velvet Underground, saying the comparison is \\"certainly not unreasonable.\\" Opening song \\"Spanish Bee\\" was described by Tiny Mix Tapes as \\"a playfully dramatic number that eases nicely into the rest of the album.\\" \\"It Girl\\" features a \\"stylish Spaghetti Western vibe.\\" \\"13\\" was described by Tiny Mix Tapes as \\"one of the funniest tracks.\\" In the words of one reviewer, \\"Stars\\" exemplifies how Newcombe's \\"Dylan-esque lyrics resonate by being both straightforward and poignant,\\" highlighting the lyrics \\"My face explodes teardrops into tears/And every second I'm not with you/Well it seems like years\\" as an example.  Packaging and release  Anton Newcombe's A Records re-released the album in 2007. A crazed-looking photograph of the band's tambourine player Joel Gion appears on the album cover, perhaps reflecting the album title Thank God for Mental Illness, which was chosen by Newcombe; when asked by The Guardian if he was debunking people's perception of the mentally ill cult rocker with the album title, Newcombe responded \\"No, it was about me. Because people ‚Äì my mom, whoever ‚Äì always said, \\"You're insane.\\" So it was a jab at that whole thing. I was like, \\"I'm insane? OK, well thank God for mental illness.\\" It was a personal statement.\\" A reviewer for Sentimentalist Mag said that, alongside Take it from the Man!, the album title was his favorite because it's a \\"simple, direct [statement] that immediately [reveals] the provocateur mind of main man/songwriter Anton Newcombe.\\" Released on October 25, 1996 by Bomp! Records, Thank God for Mental Illness was the third and final album the band released in 1996. It was the only Brian Jonestown Massacre album that Newcombe gave a copy of to his father, who committed suicide less than a year later. Much of Ondi Timoner's rockumentary film about the band Dig!, released in 2004, was filmed in the aftermath of the release of the album; the BBC stated that the album \\"was their main album at the time of the film.\\" The album was not a commercial success, and was only ever released on CD; many of the band's other albums had been issued on LP. However, on January 18, 2016, an LP edition was released in the UK by Newcombe's own record label A Records. A Records also released a remastered CD edition in the UK in 2007.  Critical reception  The album was critically acclaimed. Allmusic's Jason Ankeny praised the album, rating it four stars out of five and writing: \\"with Thank God for Mental Illness, their third collection of absolutely stunning music in less than a year, the Brian Jonestown Massacre parallels the prolific and effortless brilliance of the Rolling Stones at their fevered late-1960s peak; the sheer scope of their achievements is stunning ‚Äì rarely are bands quite so productive, or quite so consistently amazing. [...] while it lacks the blistering immediacy of their previous material, the album swaggers and struts with all of the group's usual attitude intact, coming complete with a loose, offhanded feel perfectly accenting the overall atmosphere of debauchery\\". SF Weekly called the album \\"incredibly strange\\" but still said it was \\"worthy.\\" Drowned in Sound retrospectively comments that its \\"ably demonstrates\\" the band creating \\"some wonderful music pretty much unparalleled by any of their peers.\\" Tiny Mix Tapes rated the album four and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Mental Illness proves once again that the only thing necessary to make a great rock album is that spark: that spontaneous, effortless charm which is impossible to duplicate, no matter how many producers or professional musicians one brings into the studio.\\" xsilence retrospectively rated the album 14 out of 20, saying it was a hard disc to access \\"but not without interest, that only fans and purists are likely to appreciate its true value. After all, this vintage sound, is not it simply The White Stripes before their time?\\" They said \\"the sound is crappy [...] and that's really what gives charm to this disc.\\" Debaser said that \\"this is not their best album,\\" but \\"is definitely the disk with which it is worthwhile to know them. It's like a shooting star that cannot burn. And one of the disks that surely if we ever explain why the nineties are not just throwaway we could take as an example.\\" Today the album is regarded as one of the band's best. Several years after its release, Sara Sherr for the Daily News said it might be the band's best album and described it as sounding \\"like an even blacker version of the Rolling Stones' Paint it Black.\\" That same year, LA Weekly said the album was \\"their only consistent album\\" and \\"also their most committed to slavering R&B; and minor-key Appalachian melancholy.\\" In 2015, Cracked Magazine said the album is \\"still known as one of the BJM‚Äôs best and most interesting albums.\\" FBI Radio described the album as \\"iconic\\" and Angel Fire described it as \\"stunning,\\" whilst Skiddle called the album \\"classic.\\" Debaser called it \\"the best and most hidden.\\" The Line of Best Fit said the album showed the band at their best.

It was established in the 11th century by Walter de Lacy, reusing former Roman earthworks. The castle was then rebuilt in stone by Gilbert de Lacy after 1148, who also established the adjacent town to help pay for the work. By the 14th century, Longtown Castle had fallen into decline. Despite being pressed back into use during the Owain Glynd≈µr rising in 1403, it fell into ruin. In the 21st century the castle is maintained by English Heritage and operated as a tourist attraction.  History =Earlier sites The first fortification at Longtown was a Roman fort, close to a Roman road that ran along the borderlands. The fort was square, and protected by a ditch and a timber palisade.; ; The Roman defences were reinforced, probably in 1055, after a Welsh attack on Hereford. Initial construction Plan of the castle: A - northern town enclosure; B - motte; C - eastern bailey; D - inner western bailey; E - outer western bailey; F - southern town enclosure After the Norman invasion of England and Wales in the late 11th century, a small castle began to be built at Pont Hendre, close to the site of the current castle, by Walter de Lacy in order to protect the river crossing there.; Following Welsh attacks, Walter abandoned Pont Hedre and instead started to build a castle on at Longtown, on the stie of the old Roman fort. The early castle was occasionally also called Ewias Lacey, named after the wider lordship; \\"Ewias\\" was a term meaning \\"sheep district\\".; Longtown Castle was designed as a motte and bailey castle, on high ground alongside the River Monnow. More defensible sites on higher ground existed nearby, but this location was strategically well located close to the River, an important transport route. It had a high motte and an unusual rectangular bailey design around by , divided into three parts, two baileys in the west and one in the east, each capable of being defended independently and enclosing around in total.; ; ; ; The 12th-century castle was built primarily of timber with at least some stone in its design, but this stone was then reused when the castle was rebuilt in the 13th century.; ; Two circuits of earthworks to the north and south of the castle, possibly with wooden palisades, enclosed the early settlement of Longtown. The region was troubled for the rest of the century, with revolts by the local Welsh against Anglo-Norman rule. The de Lacy's lost their lands in the region after conspiring against William II, but around 1148, Gilbert de Lacy regained the estates. Gilbert probably then rebuilt the castle in stone, at a considerable cost of ¬£37, financed by the construction of a new borough alongside it.; The stone keep was constructed in the form of a circular great tower, with walls thick and three turrets spaced evenly around the outside and a hall on the first floor.; ; This circular design is particular to the Welsh Marches, and is also seen at Skenfrith and Caldicot. The reason for this choice is unclear, as it appears to have carried few military advantages. The stonework is made up of shale rubble with cut ashlar detailing; the walls are around thick, but the keep's foundations are extremely shallow.; ; An inner gate to the western baileys was built to a simple design with two small turrets, and seems to have been fitted with a portcullis, while a thick wall encircled the rest of the inner western bailey; another stone wall seems to have protected the outer half of the bailey.; ; Inside the inner western bailey appears to have been the castle's great hall and other service buildings. Expansion and decline Motte and keep in the snow, 1978 The de Lacy family controlled Longtown Castle until Walter de Lacy's death in 1234.; John Fitzgeoffrey then acquired the castle, during a period of increased conflict and tension between the Welsh princes Llywelyn the Great and Dafydd ap Llywelyn and the English marcher lords. The castle reverted to the de Lacy family and became part of the inheritance of Margery (or Margaret) de Lacy daughter of Gilbert de Lacy, who had predeceased his father Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath, and his wife Isabel Bigod, daughter of Sir Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk. Marjory married John de Verdun of Alton, son of Theobald le Botiller and Roesia de Verdun. The de Verduns struggled with local lawlessness and the Welsh revolts which continued until the end of the century. King Edward I temporarily confiscated the castle and estates from John's son, Theobald de Verdun, 1st Baron Verdun. On Theobald's death, the castle passed to his son Theobald de Verdun, 2nd Baron Verdun, who died in 1316 without surviving male heirs, whereupon the castle became part of the inheritance of his 2nd daughter Elizabeth and by right of his wife passed to her husband Bartholomew Burghersh, 1st Baron Burghersh. The castle continued to be used as a fortification, and in 1317 orders were given to garrison it with 30 men. The castle began to decline in importance, however, and in 1369 passed to the Despensers and then the Beauchamps, neither of whom used the castle. It was temporarily refortified by Henry IV in response to the Owain Glynd≈µr uprising in North Wales in 1403.; The Nevilles acquired the property in the 15th century and it remained in the control of the Lords of Abergavenny until the 1970s. After the Black Death the town's population fell away sharply as well, the protected area north of the castle was abandoned, and by the 16th century it was no longer a functioning trading centre. It is unclear if the castle and town played any part in the English Civil War between 1642‚Äì45, although cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle. Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the castle were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the castle. By the end of the 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls. 20th - 21st centuries Longtown Castle was acquired by the Ministry of Works in the 1970s. It was in a poor condition and extensive restoration work was carried out, including the removal of many of the buildings that had encroached on the walls. In the 21st century, the central parts of Longtown Castle, including the ruined keep, the internal gatehouse and fragments of the curtain wall, are maintained by English Heritage as a tourist attraction, although the wider earthworks lie on common land.; ; In 2016, the Longtown and District Historical Society obtained Heritage Lottery Funding for a community archaeology project to research Longtown Castle over the next two years. The castle is protected as a scheduled monument.

The piccolo obligato is not found in Steele's first version of the song; it appears to have originated in an orchestration by Robert Recker from later in 1901. In New Orleans, Louisiana, Alphonse Picou adapted the piccolo part into a clarinet variation, sometimes considered one of the earliest documented jazz solos. The Picou variations became standard in New Orleans jazz (unusual in a form that values improvisation); many traditional jazz clarinetists from the generation just after Picou until today have copied or closely paraphrased Picou's solo, sometimes followed by their own improvisations on a second chorus. Picou himself recorded it a number of times in his later life, including recordings with Kid Rena and Papa Celestin and for films. The first couple of bars were frequently quoted by Charlie Parker in his improvisations. The tune was recorded as a march by Charles A. Prince's band in 1911. The first jazz recording of it was made by King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band in 1923, with Johnny Dodds on clarinet. Apparently unaware that the tune was already copyrighted, Gennett Records filed a copyright on the tune as a Joe Oliver original. In the 1920s Walter Melrose added lyrics to it (which are never performed) and republished it, as he did to several jazz compositions in order to claim a larger share of the royalties.

Malden Mills started off with specialization in lightweight fabrics and wool clothing. Fire and rebuilding The Malden Mills factory burned down on December 11, 1995.

(Textile Mill Fire Near Fleeces Polartec) Lawrence, Massachusetts was already experiencing a downward economy due to many other companies leaving to find cheaper labor elsewhere and many residents were worried about the loss of another factory. The fire injured 36 people and placed 2700 jobs at risk. The fire was later ruled an ‚Äúindustrial accident.‚Äù CEO Aaron Feuerstein made the decision overnight to quickly rebuild. He extended the pay and benefits of his employees while the factory was being rebuilt. Rebuilding was completed on September 14, 1997, leaving 70 employees still displaced.

Following Australia's entry into World War I, many Australian men volunteered to fight in Europe and were stationed in camps around Australia to receive military training before being shipped to the front. At 9.00am on 14 February 1916, at Casula Camp in Liverpool in Sydney's south west, it was announced to the recruits that the current training session would be extended into the evening, meaning a 27-hour stretch for some of the recruits. Five thousand recruits refused to accept extra duty and went on strike to protest the poor conditions at the camp. The soldiers left the camp and marched towards the centre of Liverpool, where they were joined by other recruits from camps around the area. The number of protesters now reached as many as 15 000. They invaded a number of local hotels, drinking the bars dry, refusing to pay and started to vandalise buildings. The soldiers then gained control of Liverpool train station, overpowered the engineers and commandeered trains heading towards Sydney, where they began rampaging drunkenly through Sydney streets, smashing windows and targeting anyone with a foreign-sounding name, including Italian restaurants, even though Italy was an ally of Australia in the war. Shops and hotels were looted and people were forced to take refuge in churches to avoid the soldiers. Police reinforcements were called in and began battling the soldiers in the streets of Sydney. At Sydney's Central Railway Station, armed military guards found a group of over a hundred drunken soldiers destroying a toilet block and demanded they surrender. A shot was fired by a rioting soldier over the guards' heads and in response the guards returned fire, killing one soldier and seriously injuring eight others. This incident had a sobering effect on the soldiers and many began surrendering to police and military guards, although small bands of soldiers continued to cause damage throughout the night. Following the riot, described as the \\"most disgraceful episode in our military history\\", about a thousand soldiers were court-martialled and either gaoled or discharged from the army. However, Australia was desperate for recruits to fight the war, so many soldiers escaped punishment and were sent overseas while the government, anxious to keep the image of the Australian digger as positive as possible, discouraged the media from covering the event.Cockington, J. (2003) History Happened Here, ABC Books, Sydney . As a result of the riots, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania introduced 6.00 p.m. closing of hotels to guard against a repeat occurrence, matching South Australia's introduction the previous year. It was not until 1955 that New South Wales closing was extended to 10 p.m.Freeland, J.M. (1966) The Australian Pub, Melbourne University Press, Carlton.

In 1978 they recorded a live album which should have been the first P. Mobil release, but it was released only in the spring of 1999. In 1980 he departed with S√°ndor Bencsik and formed P. Box (after a Procol Harum song). He settled in Debrecen (220 km from the capital) in 1986, and the distance caused him to disband P. Box. The other members of the band continued for a short while as Metal Company, then they united with Gyula De√°k \\"Bill\\", so their name became \\"Bill √©s Box\\". S√°ndor Bencsik left Hungary in 1987, but died suddenly in Austria. Cserh√°ti started a studio in his home, where he discovered the band \\"Szfinx\\", becoming its manager. In 1999 the first two full-length albums were re-released on CD, remastered. In 2001 he revived P. Box, with two Szfinx and two Aberra members. They released a returning single, and a year after a new album came out. In 2003 they released the first ever official concert album of P. Box. In 2005, they started to record the new album Pangea. At this time, doctors found out Cserh√°ti was ill with cancer. Despite this, they continued the recordings, and Pangea came out in July. He died in mid-August.

The album was recorded in 1981 with core member Steven Stapleton being joined by drummer Trevor Reidy and J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus for the track \\"Absent Old Queen Underfoot\\". Reidy and Thirlwell worked in the same Virgin store in London at the time and met Stapleton there. The album, however, is best known for Stapleton's long held disregard of its contents. He told David Keenan that the album was \\"dreadful\\" and \\"a pile of shit\\", stating that \\"making that record was the worst mistake of my life\\". Keenan declares the record to be nowhere near as bad as Stapleton suggests but agrees that it is a less disciplined album than those immediately surrounding it. Stapleton also advised Keenan that he had burned the mastertapes. Stapleton initially pledged never to reissue the album and stated to Keenan that it would never be available on CD. However, he recanted this position in 2006 following two events detailed by Stapleton in the sleevenotes to the new edition. Matt Waldron (working under his usual moniker irr. app. (ext.)) created a reworked version of the album which he sent to Stapleton who, delighted by it, contacted Waldron. The two became good friends and Waldron has since collaborated with NWW both live and in the studio. Waldron's version was slated for release through World Serpent but this release was cancelled when World Serpent went out of business in 2004 . At present, only a small number of copies, handmade by Waldron, exist. Shortly after this, another friend of Stapleton, Christoph Heemann, told him that Kevin Spencer of Robot Records (Heemann, Organum, The New Blockaders etc.) had created a digital remaster of the album from a vinyl copy for his own pleasure. When Stapelton heard this master, he found he was happy with the sound quality and that the album was not as bad as his memory had led him to believe. The album was therefore reissued in April 2007. The original LP release was pressed in an edition of 1000 with a small overrun of 10 copies coming in handmade sleeves. A cassette edition was issued at the same time. However, around 1987, the United Dairies catalogue began to describe this as a \\"remix\\". . Some sources declare that this edition is drastically reworked . If this is the case, then the exact date at which Stapleton destroyed the tapes may be moot. The cassette format is still available via U.S. label RRR under a licensing deal covering a number of early United Dairies cassette releases. A widely circulated \\"United Dairies\\" CD edition was a bootleg. The 2007 CD edition used the aforementioned remaster by Kevin Spencer and came as a standard CD in digipak covered with a plastic slipcase with Stapleton's sleevenote and a special edition with a framed and mounted insect in a box signed by Stapleton. When this went out of print, a new edition was prepared in 2010 that disposed of the plastic slipcase and added a newly prepared remix track, entitled \\"Tooth, Teeth, Milk, Teeth, Skin.\\" In the liner notes, the album is dedicated to Boris Vian. The dedication thus continues a tradition of Nurse With Wound releases being explicitly dedicated to, or otherwise inspired by earlier surreal or \\"weird\\" artists; the debut album Chance Meeting... had been dedicated to Luigi Russolo, and the following album Homotopy to Marie was listed as being inspired by Franz Kamin.

In English the demonym, or noun, is German. During the early Renaissance, \\"German\\" implied that the person spoke German as a native language. Until the German unification, people living in what is now Germany were named for the region in which they lived: examples are Bavarians and Brandenburgers. Some terms are humorous or pejorative slang, and used mainly by people from other countries, although they can be used in a self-deprecating way by German people themselves. Other terms are serious or tongue-in-cheek attempts to coin words as alternatives to the ambiguous standard terms. Many pejorative terms for Germans in various countries originated during the two World Wars. English=Hun (pejorative) A First World War Canadian electoral campaign poster Hun (or The Hun) is a term used in reference to the Huns of the Migration Period. This term was used heavily during World War I and was often seen on Allied war posters. The origin of the term was a reference to Attila the Hun in Wilhelm II's \\"Hun speech\\" (') delivered on 27 July 1900, when he bade farewell to the German expeditionary corps sailing from Bremerhaven to defeat the Boxer Rebellion. The relevant part of the speech was: The theme of Hunnic savagery was then developed in a speech of August Bebel in the Reichstag in which he recounted details of the cruelty of the German expedition which were taken from soldiers' letters home, styled the ' (letters from the Huns). The Kaiser's speech was widely reported in the European press at that time. At the start of the First World War, and following the brutal and ruthless actions of the German Army during their invasion of Belgium, the term was revived: It became the basis for the characterisation of the Germans during World War I as barbarians and savages with no respect for European civilisation and humanitarian values. The term \\"Hun\\" from this speech was later used for the Germans by British propaganda during World War I. The comparison was helped by the spiked Pickelhaube helmet worn by German forces until 1916, which would be reminiscent of images depicting ancient Hun helmets. This usage, emphasising the idea that the Germans were barbarians, was reinforced by Allied propaganda throughout the war. The French songwriter Th√©odore Botrel described the Kaiser as \\"an Attila, without remorse\\", launching \\"cannibal hordes\\".\\"Quand un Attila, sans remords, / Lance ses hordes cannibales, / Tout est bon qui meurtrit et mord: / Les chansons, aussi, sont des balles!\\", from Theodore Botrel, by Edgar Preston T.P.'s Journal of Great Deeds of the Great War, 27 February 1915 By coincidence, Gott mit uns (\\"God is with us\\"), a motto first used in the Kingdom of Prussia and later the German Empire, may have contributed to the popularization of 'Huns' as British Army slang for Germans by misreading 'uns' for 'Huns'.Original wavelength The usage of the term \\"Hun\\" to describe Germans resurfaced during World War II, although less frequently than in the previous war. For example, Winston Churchill 1941 said in a broadcast speech: \\"There are less than 70,000,000 malignant Huns, some of whom are curable and others killable, most of whom are already engaged in holding down Austrians, Czechs, Poles and the many other ancient races they now bully and pillage.\\" Later that year Churchill referred to the invasion of the Soviet Union as \\"the dull, drilled, docile brutish masses of the Hun soldiery, plodding on like a swarm of crawling locusts.\\"Churchill, Winston S. 1941. \\"WINSTON CHURCHILL'S BROADCAST ON THE SOVIET-GERMAN WAR\\", London, June 22, 1941 During this time American President Franklin D. Roosevelt also referred to the German people in this way, saying that an Allied invasion into Southern France would surely \\"be successful and of great assistance to Eisenhower in driving the Huns from France.\\"Winston Churchill. 1953. \\"Triumph and Tragedy\\" (volume 6 of The Second World War). Boston: Houghton-Mifflin. Ch. 4, p. 70 Fritz British soldiers employed a variety of epithets for the Germans. Fritz, a German pet form of Friedrich, was popular in both World War I and World War II, with Jerry, short for \\"German\\", but also modeled on the English name, favoured in the latter. Heinie (pejorative) The Americans and Canadians referred to Germans, especially German soldiers, as Heinies, from a diminutive of the common German male proper name Heinrich. For example, in the film 1941 the Slim Pickens character calls a German officer \\"Mr Hynee Kraut!\\" Heinie is also a colloquial term for buttocks, in use since the 1920s.Heinie, Merriam-Webster Dictionary In German, Heini is a common colloquial term with a slightly pejorative meaning similar to \\"moron\\" or \\"idiot\\", but it could be of different origin. Jerry  World War One Stahlhelm, said by the British to resemble a Jeroboam. Jerry was a nickname given to Germans during the Second World War by soldiers and civilians of the Allied nations, in particular by the British. The nickname was originally created during World War One. The name Jerry was possibly derived from the stahlhelm introduced in 1916, which was said by British soldiers to resemble a chamber pot or Jeroboam. Alternatively, it may be a simple alteration of the word German. Kraut (pejorative) Since World War II, Kraut has come to be used in the English language as a pejorative term for a German. This is probably based on sauerkraut, which is popular in various South German cuisines but not traditionally prepared in North Germany. The stereotype of the sauerkraut-eating German pre-dates this, as it appears in Jules Verne's depiction of the evil German industrialist Schultze as an avid sauerkraut eater in The Begum's Fortune. Schultze's antagonist is an Alsatian who hates sauerkraut but pretends to love it to win his enemy's confidence. \\"Kraut\\" may refer to the practice of distributing sauerkraut on German ships to prevent scurvy just as the English were referred to as limeys by Americans for their use of lime juice in navy ships. The rock music genre krautrock has been commonplace in music journalism since the early 1970s and is of English invention; it is not considered pejorative. Nazi (pejorative) Nazi, a shortening of Nationalsozialist (National Socialist) (attested since 1903, as a shortening of national-sozial,, Nazi, Etymology Online, citing Friedrich Kluge, Elmar Seebold, Etymologisches W√∂rterbuch der deutschen Sprache, 24. Auflage (Walter de Gruyter, Berlin/New York 2002, ) since in German the nati- in national is approximately pronounced Nazi. A homonymic term Nazi was in use before the rise of the NSDAP in Bavaria as a pet name for Ignaz and (by extension from that) a derogatory word for a backwards peasant, which may have influenced the use of that abbreviation by the Nazis‚Ä≤ opponents and its avoidance by the Nazis themselves. Ted \\"Ted\\", and \\"Teds\\", from Tedeschi, the Italian word for Germans, became the term used by Allied soldiers during the Italian campaign of World War II.NZ Army Board (1946) One More River: With the Second New Zealand Division from Florence to Trieste p42 Army Board Wellington (ISBN none)Bob Pearson (2014) A Peg Leg Hero Australian Self-Publishing Group p.111 Teuton (poetic) In a more poetical sense Germans can be referred to as Teutons. The usage of the word in this term has been observed in English since 1833. The word originated via an ancient Germanic tribe, the Teutons (see also Teutonic and the Teutonic Order). Boche (pejorative) Pronounced , ' is a derisive term used by the Allies during World War I, often collectively (\\"the Boche\\" meaning \\"the Germans\\"). It is a shortened form of the French slang portmanteau ', itself derived from ' (\\"German\\") and ' (\\"head\\" or \\"cabbage\\"). The alternative spellings \\"Bosch\\" or \\"Bosche\\" are sometimes found.National Library of Scotland Digital Archive (click \\"More information\\")Boche , The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language According to a 1916 article in the New York Times magazine Current History, the origin is as follows: Squarehead (pejorative) \\"Squarehead\\", a generic derogatory term for people from Germany and Scandinavia;Squarehead at Merriam-Webster Commonly used for Germans during the First and Second World War, but found in a collection of slang from 1906 relating particularly to German military style.Squarehead at OED The term Boxhead, commonly used after World War II within the British Armed Forces in the former West Germany is derived from this. Erics  First came to prominence in the English 1983 television show Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. It was a term used by the English and Irish when referring to Germans without them knowing it was them being talked about. Other countries=AustriaPiefke (pejorative)= The Austrian ethnic slur for a German is Piefke. Like its Bavarian counterpart Sauprei√ü (literally: sow- Prussian), the term Piefke historically characterized only the people of Prussia, and not people of other Germanic states. There are two hypotheses on how the term developed; both of them suggest an origin in the 1860s. One theory suggests that the term came from the name of the popular Prussian composer Johann Gottfried Piefke, who composed some of the most iconic German military marches, for example Preu√üens Gloria and the K√∂niggr√§tzer Marsch ‚Äì particularly since Piefke and his brother conducted the Prussian music corps in the parade in Austria following the Prussian victory of the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The second theory suggests an origin in the Second Schleswig War in 1864, where Prussians and Austrians were allies. A Prussian soldier with the name Piefke and a stereotypically Prussian gruff and snappy manner made such a negative impression on his Austrian comrades that the term came to refer to all Prussians.Peter Wehle. \\"Die Wiener Gaunersprache\\", 1977, p. 79 Since Prussia no longer exists, the term now refers to the clich√© of a pompous northern Protestant German in general and a Berliner in particular. However, the citizens of the free Hanseatic cities and the former northern duchies of Oldenburg, Brunswick and Mecklenburg are also quite offended by the terms Piefke and also by Sauprei√ü (a slur for any German who is not native Bavarian). In 1990, Austrian playwright Felix Mitterer wrote and co-directed a TV mini-series, Die Piefke-Saga, about Germans on holiday in Tyrol. Sometimes the alteration \\"Piefkinese\\" is used. Some Austrians use the playful term \\"Piefkinesisch\\" (Pief-Chinese) to refer to German spoken in a distinctly northern German ‚Äì that is, not Austrian ‚Äì accent. =Marmeladinger (pejorative)= The term Marmeladinger originated in the trenches of World War I. It is derived from the German word \\"Marmelade\\", which is a fruit preserve. While Austrian infantry rations included butter and lard as spread, German troops had to make do with cheaper \\"Marmelade\\" as ersatz. They disdainfully called it Heldenbutter \\"hero's butter\\" or Hindenburgfett. This earned them ridicule from their Austrian allies who would call them Marmeladebr√ºder (jam brothers) or Marmeladinger (-inger being an Austrian derivational suffix describing a person through a characteristic item or action).Anton Karl Mally: ‚ÄûPiefke\\". Herkunft und Rolle eines √∂sterreichischen Spitznamens f√ºr den Preu√üen, den Nord- und den Reichsdeutschen, in: Muttersprache. Zeitschrift zur Pflege und Erforschung der deutschen Sprache, [Wiesbaden] 1984, number 4, pp. 257-286. Germans would conversely call Austrians Kamerad Schn√ºrschuh \\"comrade lace-up shoe\\" because the Austrian infantry boots used laces while the German boots did not. This term has survived, but it is rarely used. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia≈†vabo, ≈†vaba (pejorative)= The Term ≈†vabo (Cyrillic: –®–≤–∞–±–æ) is most often used in jokes but also very popularly used by the Yugoslav Partisans during the Second World War. In the SFR Yugoslavia it was commonly used in movies depicting battles betweens the Partisans and Nazi forces. The word in its origin is not pejorative since it is used to depict a person from the German region of Swabia; however, the word probably entered the Bosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, and Serbian languages in relation to the Danube Swabians. The variant ≈†vaba (–®–≤–∞–±–∞) is primarily used in the Serbian language. The female form is ≈†vabica (–®–≤–∞–±–∏—Ü–∞). ChinaJiamen (colloquial)= In Shanghainese, a German can be colloquially called a Jiamen (ËåÑÈñÄ/ËåÑÈó®), which is an adaptation of the English word \\"German\\". This word carries a somewhat negative meaning of a stereotypical German being proud, withdrawn, cold and serious. Today, this phrase, when pronounced as \\"Ga-Men\\", can mean \\"disdainful, indifferent, or uninterested in someone or something\\". Czech Republic In Czech, a German can be called a Skopƒç√°k (skopchƒÅk), originally meaning just someone from the highlands (of the Sudeten mountains). Due to the negative perception of the Sudeten Germans‚Ä≤ role in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1938-9, it is generally perceived negatively, relating to rough and stupid manners ascribed to Germans (skopov√° hlava - muttonhead). Finland During the Lapland War between Finland and Germany, the terms saku, sakemanni, hunni and lapinpolttaja (burner of Lapland) became widely used among the Finnish soldiers, saku and sakemanni being modified from saksalainen (German). FranceBoches (pejorative, historical)= Boches is an apheresis of the word alboche, which in turn is a blend of allemand (French for German) and caboche (slang for head). It was used mainly during the First and Second World Wars, and directed especially at German soldiers. =Casque √† pointe (historical)= Two leather Pickelhauben, or \\"casques √† pointe\\" from the Franco-Prussian War era. Casque √† pointe is derived from the French name for the traditional Prussian military helmets worn by German soldiers from the 1840s until World War I. In modern British and American sign language, the word for Germany continues to be an index finger pointed to the top of the forehead, simulating the Pickelhaube. =Chleuh (pejorative)= Chleuh derives from the name of the Chleuh, a Berber ethnic group in Morocco. It also denotes the absence of words beginning in Schl- in French. GermanyOssi/Wessi= The term Ossi, derived from the German word Osten which means east, is used in Germany for people who were born in the area of the former German Democratic Republic. The term Wessi, derived from the German word Westen which means west, is used in Germany for people who were born or live in the old states of Germany (those that formed the Federal Republic or \\"West Germany\\" before reunification). Sometimes it is also modified to \\"Besserwessi\\", from the German word Besserwisser which means Know-it-all, reflecting the stereotype that people from the Western part of Germany are arrogant. In 2010 there was a lawsuit in Germany because a job applicant was denied employment and her application was found to have the notation \\"Ossi\\" and a minus sign written on her application documents. A German court decided that denial of employment for such a reason would be discrimination, but not ethnic discrimination, since \\"East German\\" is not an ethnicity. =Other Terms= The term Sauprei√ü, derived from the German words Sau which means female pig and Preu√üe which means Prussian, is used in Bavaria for people who were born or live in any German area north of the Danube river, or at least north of the Bavarian border. A number of other terms exist. Similar to the Polish Szwab, the term Schwab can be pejorative and be used to express Schwabenhass. Various ‚Äì more or less good-humoured ‚Äì nicknames are being used between the different German states or areas, such as Gelbf√º√üler (\\"Yellowfeet\\") for the inhabitants of Baden. Hungary Sv√°b = The term sv√°b derives from the German word \\"Schwaben\\", describing people from Swabia (ger: Schwaben). The first German-speaking people (Saxon merchants and miners, see: Carpathian Germans) first arrived to the Carpathian basin (then mostly under rule of the Kingdom of Hungary) in the 12th century, their numbers and territory of settlement were limited, mainly in towns. In the 18th century various German-speaking peasant groups settled in Hungary in large numbers to inhabit the vast territories being depopulated during the Osman rule, they are known as Danube Swabians (Donauschwaben), though most of their forefathers have Bavarian or Thuringian roots. They settled mainly where the destruction was most severe, especially around Buda (now: Budapest), Danube valley and southern part of Hungary. Although they have assimilated in large parts until the beginning of the 20th century, they maintained strong cultural identity up to date. These people, and through them German people in general are called sv√°bok (plural), having a hint of pejorative nature. =Labanc= The term labanc came into use during R√°k√≥czi's War of Independence. It was specifically used for the soldiers fighting for the Austrian/German soldiers of the Habsburg rulers. There are multiple theories about where it came from, such as being a strange concatenation of the German term \\"Lauf Hans!\\" (Run Hans!) or the French term Le Blanc (the white one), it might also be a reference to the Hungarian word lobonc which referred to the large, common wig, which used to be common in the Vienna court at the time. Now Labanc is exclusively used for Austrians, but becomes rare in usage as there are no tensions between the two countries. Still however, the expression describes mentality or behaviour that is counter to general Hungarian interest and describes persons not content with \\"true\\" Hungarian values. ItalyCrucco (pejorative)= The term crucco derived from the Slovenian kruh (\\"bread\\"). Italian soldiers invented this word during World War I when they captured some hungry Austrian-Slovenian soldiers who asked for \\"kruh\\". Later, during World War II, it was applied to German people. =Tuder / Tudro (pejorative)= Tudro designates Germans as a people lacking flexibility and fantasy, but also emotional intelligence. It is more widely adopted to describe a sturdy and stupid man. Tudro is mainly used in Northern Italy. Tuder is the Lombard usage of the word. LatviaFricis= Fricis derives from the German name Fritz. =Zili pelƒìkie= Zili pelƒìkie, literally translated, means \\"The Blue-Grays\\", from the Prussian war uniforms of the pre-World War I era. The term appeared in a popular Latvian legionnaire wartime song Ik katru sestdien's vakaru (\\"Every saturday night\\") about trouncing the blue-grays after beating up reds (sarkanos) or lice-infested ones (utainos) ‚Äì the Soviets. Netherlands and BelgiumMof (pejorative)= In Dutch the most common term for the German people, after the regular/official \\"Duitse\\", is mof. It is regarded as a pejorative term, used exclusively for Germans and reflecting Dutch resentment of the German occupation of the Netherlands during the Second World War and the respective German actions.Prisma Etymologisch woordenboek, . \\"Mof heeft historisch gezien niet de huidige betekenis (die van een verwijzing naar de Duitsers en hun acties tijdens de Tweede wereldoorlog) maar ‚Ä¶\\" The word \\"Mofrika\\" is a portmanteau of Africa and \\"mof\\" and is used as a humorous reference to Germany. In the late 16th century the area now known as East Frisia and Emsland and the people that lived there were referred to as Muffe. At the time the Netherlands was by far the richest country in the whole of Europe, and these people were looked down upon greatly by the Dutch. The area of Western Lower Saxony was at that time very poor and a good source for many Dutch people looking for cheap labour. The inhabitants of this region were regarded as being rather reserved and were often described as grumpy, rude and unsophisticated by the Dutch. Later the term was used to describe the whole of Germany, which, at the time, was not much better off economically than Western Lower Saxony, mainly due to the various wars waged on its territory by foreign powers. The term seemed to have died out around 1900, but returned after the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940.Why Germans are called \\"moffen\\" (Dutch) A popular humorous (but false) etymology of the word mof by the Dutch is that it is a German abbreviation meaning Menschen ohne Freunde (\\"people without friends\\"). PolandFryc (pejorative)= Means novice, and comes from the German name Fritz, which is a diminutive of Friedrich. German trade and settlements acquainted Poles with this name. German coming to Poland was actually a novice hence was called Fryc. =Prusak (pejorative)= Historically characterized only the people of Prussia, not people of other Germanic states. During Partitions of Poland under Prussian Partition gained negative connotations. Prusak also refers to German cockroach. =Szkop (pejorative)= Contemptuous term for a German, especially a soldier of the Wehrmacht during World War II. In the past, the word szkop in the Polish language meant a castrated ram.:pl:Szkop at Polish Wikipedia =Szwab (pejorative)= Another popular term, originally meaning a person from Swabia. It is worth noting that a colloquial verb \\"oszwabiƒá\\" means \\"to rook\\", \\"to fleece\\". =Other terms= Another pejorative term for a German (and, stereotypically, unattractive) woman is niemra, coming from a word \\"Niemka\\" (a woman of German nationality). This term can also mean a female German language teacher or German language classes. Similarly, the term for the Germans can be niemiaszki. It does not have to be pejorative, it may be permissive or irreverent, but it may also be used in an almost caressing way. Next term is Helmut that refers to the popular german name. Another pejorative term for a German is szo≈Çdra (plural: szo≈Çdry). However, it is an old Polish term, out of use nowadays. It can be found in 19th century historical novels by Henryk Sienkiewicz and J√≥zef Ignacy Kraszewski. It comes from a term meaning pork or ham. Next pejorative and historical term is pluder came from Hose (clothing) being the part of warderobe. Russia Fritz(y) = German(s), from the nickname Fritz. Nemetz(y) = German(s), from the word German. Spain Tudesco (historical)= In Early Modern Spanish (for example in Don Quixote), tudesco (cognate with deutsch and the Italian tedesco) was used sometimes as a general name for GermansDon Quixote, Second Part, chapter LIV, Miguel de Cervantes: Sancho Panza meets some pilgrims (alem√°n o tudesco) from Augsburg. and sometimes restricted to Lower Saxony.tudesco in the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola.Don Quixote, Second part, chapter V: ¬øCu√°ntos son los alemanes, tudescos, franceses, espa√±oles, italianos y esgu√≠zaros? \\"How many are the Almains, Dutch, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians and Swiss?\\" SwitzerlandGummihals (pejorative)= German for rubber-neck. The term has been verified to be in use since the 1970s at least. Its actual meaning is subject to debate. Theories include the stereotype of Germans talking too much or nodding their heads endlessly when listening to superiors.Bruno Ziauddin: Gr√ºezi Gummih√§lse. Warum uns die Deutschen manchmal auf die Nerven gehen. Rowohlt, Reinbek 2008, =Schwab (pejorative)= The ordinary (non-pejorative) meaning is people from Swabia (roughly Baden- W√ºrttemberg) in South Germany, neighbouring Switzerland, but in Switzerland it is used for any German. A strengthening is Sauschwabe.

The Mawson Plateau is part of the northern Flinders Ranges, located on the Mount Freeling pastoral lease in South Australia, 140 km east of Lyndhurst and adjacent to the northeastern boundary of Arkaroola. Geography The Mawson Plateau is a 71 km¬≤ granite batholith at a height of between 600 and 750m. It is dissected by Saucepan Creek and the Granite Plateau Creek; both are tributaries of the Hamilton Creek. The plateau is bounded by the Hamilton Creek on the north and west, the Granite Escarpment on the east and Freeling Heights in the south. Place names Eroded granite column on the central plateau . Granite cliff overlooking Saucepan Creek. Originally known as the Freeling Heights lower granite plateau, it was renamed The Mawson Plateau after Sir Douglas Mawson.Sprigg, R. C. (Reginald Claude): \\"Arkaroola-Mount Painter in the northern Flinders Ranges, S.A : The Last Billion Years.\\" Page 298, Arkaroola Pty Ltd, 1984 The main creek on the plateau has been known by successive owners of the Mount Freeling pastoral lease as the Granite Plateau Creek. T Junction Waterhole appears on the Yudnamutana 1:50000 topographical map and is ~100m downstream from a distinctive T-junction on Granite Plateau Creek. The waterhole is the location of an old emergency rations cache put there in the early 1980s by the owners of the Arkaroola pastoral lease. The Granite Escarpment also appears on the Yudnamutana 1:50000 topographical map. It is a high ridge of exposed and weathered granite overlooking Lake Frome. In a gorge on Granite Plateau Creek there is a high granite cliff known to bushwalkers as Aqualung Wall . At the base of the cliff there are permanent waterholes containing water spiders (Dolomedes spp.). The name of the cliff refers to the spider‚Äôs habit of submerging below the surface to hunt, or avoid predation, while breathing from bubbles of air attached to hairs on its abdomen. Edmund Hill is a small peak high on the central plateau with 360-degree panoramic views of the plateau. Ray's Waterhole is a picturesque permanent waterhole on Saucepan Creek. The plateau is a remote and inaccessible wilderness and it is very unusual to find any modern human artifacts on the plateau. When they are found at, or near significant locations they occasionally contribute to the place name: Stardrop Waterhole is a permanent waterhole upstream of T Junction Waterhole and is named after the solitary steel \\"star dropper\\" fence post found at the site. Saucepan Creek is a major tributary of the Granite Plateau Creek. The name refers to the discovery of two abandoned, or lost, saucepans found at different times, and at separate locations along the creek. One was found hanging from a river red gum at the junction (Saucepan Junction) of Saucepan Creek and the Granite Plateau Creek , the other was found near a major waterfall on Saucepan Creek. Climate Eroded granite boulders near the Granite Escarpment. The plateau is located within one of Australia‚Äôs major bioclimatic regions-the arid Eyrean region. Average rainfall on the adjoining pastoral lease of Arkaroola is 265 mm; however the Gammon Ranges Rainfall Project (Maier and Wright 1996),Brandle, R: \\"A Biological Survey of the Flinders Ranges, South Australia 1997-1999 (Biodiversity Survey and Monitoring, National Parks and Wildlife, South Australia, Department for Environment and Heritage)\\" Page 3, Department for Environment and Heritage, 2001 which began monitoring rainfall on the nearby Gammon Plateau at 930m in 1988 indicated that rainfall and number of rain days increases with altitudes greater than 400m above sea level in this area. With the Mawson Plateau at ~700m, rainfall averages are likely to be higher than those at Arkaroola. Maier and Wright found that increased rainfall at altitude was predominantly winter rainfall, however the area is strongly influenced by summer storms. The influence of these unpredictable summer storms is reflected in the differences between the highest and lowest annual rainfall records recorded at Arkaroola (56mm ‚Äì 949mm). Similar variations certainly occur on the Mawson Plateau. Aquatic habitat Waterhole on the Granite Plateau Creek; the more permanent of these waterholes support small populations of unidentified fish. The plateau is a drainage basin for the Granite Plateau Creek, and its major tributary, Saucepan Creek. Both of these creeks flow only briefly after rain and as the region receives highly variable rainfall, water is scarce for most of the year and both creeks are ephemeral. In places the creeks have cut deep gorges and valleys into the plateau‚Äôs granite creating permanent and semi- permanent waterholes that support numerous species of frogs including the brown toadlet (Pseudophryne bibroniiand), water spiders (Dolomedes spp.) and small populations of unidentified fish. The fish are possibly spangled perch, (Leiopotherapon unicolor) a widely distributed desert fish common in much of the Hamilton Creek Catchment, or Lake Eyre Hardyhead, (Craterocephalus eyresii) the most common and widely distributed fish in the Flinders Ranges. Fauna Despite the relative abundance of permanent water, mammals and birds are sparse on the plateau, but there are small populations of euros (Macropus robustus), echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatusand) and a few species of bats. Feral goats are rare. Common birds include willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), and the Australian boobook (Ninox boobook). Reptiles have fared better than mammals and there are numerous species of snakes, skinks and dragons.

Anderson (April 29, 1906 - October 23, 1989) was an automotive designer in the North American automotive industry at General Motors and notably as the lead designer for American Motors Corporation (AMC) from 1950 to 1961. Early life Edmund E. Anderson was born in South Boardman Michigan, the son ofJoseph P and Nanny Anderson. The family moved to Alba Michigan when Edmund was a young man. His family had a Saw/Lumber Mill Nephew Before World War II, Anderson, became head of GM's Oldsmobile Styling Studio. He then headed the Chevrolet Styling Studios. Anderson was described as a capable designer and a good administrator, but his greatest talent was an ability to spot talented people. Anderson was recruited in 1950 by George W. Mason, the president of Nash Motors, to develop the independent automaker's own in-house design studio - which became known as Nash Styling. From 1950 to 1955, Anderson worked with Helene Rother who was under contract for the company and responsible for interiors that offered beautiful designs. Anderson also hired Bill Reddig, a talented former Ford Motor Company designer, who made important contributions to the 1954 Rambler line. Anderson designs Anderson was best known for 59 Rambler American (First generation) 1961 Rambler American Custom Convertible (Second generation) 1964 Rambler American (Third generation) Before Anderson joined Nash, the company had relied on outside designers. Nevertheless, Nash retained Europe's best designer, the celebrated Battista Farina, as a consultant. Even with a new Nash Styling department in-house, the company continued to hire outside stylists (including Detroit-based William J. Flajole) to work on special projects such as the Nash Metropolitan. Anderson was also responsible for the Pininfarina Nash of 1952. He revised the highly acclaimed Italian designer's contracted work for a more American look. However, the \\"Pininfarina\\" logo remained on the car because of its marketing value. After Nash and Hudson merged to form American Motors in 1954, Anderson set up separate design studios for Nash, Hudson, and Rambler. However, following the introduction of the landmark 1956 Rambler designed by Anderson, AMC dropped the Nash and Hudson brands to focus on the popular Rambler. The Rambler Styling Studio was given full responsibility for designing the company‚Äôs cars and Farina was released from his exclusive design agreement with AMC. Anderson was largely responsible for some rather brilliant re-designs of existing AMC products during his tenure as AMC's Director of Styling. He is also blamed for the \\"V-Line Styling\\" on the 1956 Hudsons. However, the 1956 and 1957 Hudson cars were actually designed by independent industrial designer Richard Arbib. Other notable achievements included the revamped 1955 Nash Rambler that became the 1958-1960 Rambler American (first generation). With its subsequent 1961 restyle, Anderson gave the second generation Rambler American an entirely new look without any major re-tooling costs. This allowed AMC to make money in a very tight, competitive market. The third generation of the compact 1964 Rambler American was also unique. It used some of the larger 1963 Classic body components, and this was also Anderson's work. After asking to be named Vice President of Styling, and being rebuffed, Anderson resigned from the company effective December 1961, and retired to Mexico. His replacement as AMC's principal designer was Dick Teague.

Career Born in Coventry, Giddings, a left-back, broke into the Coventry City first-team for his debut at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, when he came on as a late substitute in the final match of the season against Crystal Palace. He represented England at all youth age groups up to under-19 level, but missed out on the 2005 Under 19 European Championships because of injury. He returned to action as a substitute during a 2‚Äì2 draw with Cardiff City in February 2007, but spent the rest of the campaign regaining his fitness ahead of a make-or-break 2007‚Äì08 season. Giddings struggled once again with injury during the 2007‚Äì08 season. Once he regained fitness, he was sent out on loan to Oldham Athletic. New Coventry manager Chris Coleman announced that Giddings would be one of eight players whose contracts would not be renewed at the end of the season so he was released. In September 2008, Giddings joined Hinckley United debuting in the 4‚Äì1 FA Cup second qualifying round home victory over Solihull Moors on 27 September 2008. On 10 November 2009, Giddings left Hinckley United to go on a week-long trial with Darlington, then bottom of the Football League. He earned a contract until the end of the season, and made 22 appearances, but was released early from his contract. Having trialled with Kidderminster Harriers during the pre-season, Giddings joined Ilkeston Town for the 2010‚Äì2011 season. After the demise of Ilkeston Town in September 2010, Giddings rejoined Hinckley United on 1 October 2010. Giddings' career has been set back by a long-term knee injury.

The rule finds application in thermodynamics, where frequently three variables can be related by a function of the form f(x, y, z) = 0, so each variable is given as an implicit function of the other two variables. For example, an equation of state for a fluid relates temperature, pressure, and volume in this manner. The triple product rule for such interrelated variables x, y, and z comes from using a reciprocity relation on the result of the implicit function theorem and is given by :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y = -1. ::Note: In each factor the variable in the numerator is considered to be an implicit function of the other two. In each factor the subscripted variable is being held constant. Here the subscripts indicate which variables are held constant when the partial derivative is taken. That is, to explicitly compute the partial derivative of x with respect to y with z held constant, one would write x as a function of y and z and take the partial derivative of this function with respect to y only. The advantage of the triple product rule is that by rearranging terms, one can derive a number of substitution identities which allow one to replace partial derivatives which are difficult to analytically evaluate, experimentally measure, or integrate with quotients of partial derivatives which are easier to work with. For example, :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z = - \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y} Various other forms of the rule are present in the literature; these can be derived by permuting the variables {x, y, z}.  Derivation  An informal derivation follows. Suppose that f(x, y, z) = 0. Write z as a function of x and y. Thus the total differential dz is :dz = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y dx + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x dy Suppose that we move along a curve with dz = 0, where the curve is parameterized by x. Thus y can be written in terms of x, so on this curve :dy = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_z dx Therefore, the equation for dz = 0 becomes :0 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y \\\\, dx + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_z \\\\, dx Since this must be true for all dx, rearranging terms gives :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y = -\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_x \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_z Dividing by the derivatives on the right hand side gives the triple product rule :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y = -1 Note that this proof makes many implicit assumptions regarding the existence of partial derivatives, the existence of the exact differential dz, the ability to construct a curve in some neighborhood with dz = 0, and the nonzero value of partial derivatives and their reciprocals. A formal proof based on mathematical analysis would eliminate these potential ambiguities.  Alternative derivation  Suppose a function f(x,y,z)=0, where x,y and z are functions of each other. Write the total differentials of the variables :dx = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z dy + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_y dz :dy = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_z dx + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x dz Substitute dy into dx :dx = \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z \\\\left[ \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_z dx + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x dz\\\\right] + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_y dz By using the chain rule one can show the coefficient of dx is equal to one, thus the coefficient of dz must be zero : \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_y = 0 Subtracting the second term and multiplying by its inverse gives the triple product rule :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)_z\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)_x\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial z}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)_y = -1. Applications The profile of a traveling wave at time t (solid line) and t+Œît (dashed line). In the time interval Œît, the point p2 will rise up to the same height that p1 had at time t. A geometric realization of the triple product rule can be found in its close ties to the velocity of a traveling wave :\\\\phi(x,t) = A \\\\cos (kx - \\\\omega t) shown on the right at time t (solid blue line) and at a short time later t+Œît (dashed). The wave maintains its shape as it propagates, so that a point at position x at time t will correspond to a point at position x+Œîx at time t+Œît, :A \\\\cos (kx - \\\\omega t) = A \\\\cos (k (x + \\\\Delta x) - \\\\omega (t + \\\\Delta t)). This equation can only be satisfied for all x and t if kŒîx-œâŒît=0, resulting in the formula for the phase velocity : v = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k}. To elucidate the connection with the triple product rule, consider the point p1 at time t and its corresponding point (with the same height) pÃÑ1 at t+Œît. Define p2 as the point at time t whose x-coordinate matches that of pÃÑ1, and define pÃÑ2 to be the corresponding point of p2 as shown in the figure on the right. The distance Œîx between p1 and pÃÑ1 is the same as the distance between p2 and pÃÑ2 (green lines), and dividing this distance by Œît yields the speed of the wave. To compute Œîx, consider the two partial derivatives computed at p2, : \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)_x \\\\Delta t = \\\\text{rise from }p_2\\\\text{ to }\\\\bar{p}_1\\\\text{ in time }\\\\Delta t\\\\text{ (gold line)} : \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_t = \\\\text{slope of the wave (red line) at time }t. Dividing these two partial derivatives and using the definition of the slope (rise divided by run) gives us the desired formula for : \\\\Delta x = - \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)_x \\\\Delta t}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_t}, where the negative sign accounts for the fact that p1 lies behind p2 relative to the wave's motion. Thus, the wave's velocity is given by : v = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{\\\\Delta t} = - \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)_x}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_t}. For infinitesimal Œît, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)_\\\\phi and we recover the triple product rule : v = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta x}{\\\\Delta t} = - \\\\frac{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right)_x}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)_t}.

Early years Whalley was born in 1927 and went to school at Blackheath College in Charters Towers where she gained her Queensland Senior Certificate. Rhoda Felgate, MBE, a visiting examiner in Speech and Drama and also Artistic Director of Twelfth Night Theatre in Brisbane, had seen considerable ability in Whalley as a young student acting in college plays. Whalley went on to study Speech and Drama through Trinity College, London and for a time was a teacher at her old school.Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia, Brisbane, 1978, p.227 Knowing the standard of Whalley's teaching, Felgate invited her in 1950 to come to Twelfth Night Theatre, beginning in 1951 as a teacher and student. In an interview in 1978, Whalley commented on the period, \\"I was attending classes and teaching private pupils ... Every night when I finished teaching I would go to an acting class, a mime class or a fencing class ..\\" Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia', Brisbane, 1978, p.227' Whalley also commented on her first directing experience at Twelfth Night Theatre, \\"The first play I directed ... In those days we had one act play competitions in the theatre, which I believe is a very good things for directors ... the first year I won.\\" Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia, Brisbane, 1978, p.227 Whalley went on to study a course in theatre production later in the 1950s at the London Actors Studio, a training institution that placed emphasis on a new acting style advocating realism and scorn for inhibitions.Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia, Brisbane, 1978, p.220 National Institute of Dramatic Art In 1958, Whalley attended a drama school at the University of New South Wales. Robert Quentin, who had noted Whalley's success as a director of Waiting for Godot by Samuel Beckett and also the Queensland Centenary Pageant in 1959, invited her to lecture in speech for two years at the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Sydney as part of its foundation staff.Radbourne, J., 'Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia', Brisbane, 1978, p.235 Twelfth Night Theatre and other roles Whalley succeeded Rhoda Felgate, MBE as artistic director at Twelfth Night Theatre. She presented an extremely large range of productions, both period and modern, and was a strong advocate for Australian Theatre. Her production of King Lear by William Shakespeare in 1966 was commended by theatre critic, Bob Hart, who commented in the Brisbane 'Courier Mail', \\"Director Joan Whalley has done a tremendous job with 'Lear', and has made full use of her cast.\\" Hart, B, The Courier-Mail, Brisbane, 18 May 1966 As Artistic Director, she was not afraid to push established boundaries. One such case was the staging of Norm and Ahmed by Australian playwright, Alexander Buzo in 1966. The play is about racial bigotry and ends with Norm using offensive language attacking Ahmed. After the use of the offensive material, Queensland Police rushed on to the stage and arrested actor, Norm Staines and carted him off to the Brisbane Watch-house. Local Brisbane actors rallied to his defence and raised the bail monies and Staines continued performing until the end of the season. The case came to trial before the Magistrates Court. Staines was eventually convicted and fined, but on appeal to the Supreme Court was cleared. The police appealed the decision before the High Court who found there was no case to answer.Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia, Brisbane, 1978, p.252 Whalley commented on the fiasco stating, \\"The judgement of the Full Court is a judgement in favour of theatre in Brisbane. Theatre belongs to the people, and symbolises the feelings and actions of the people. If theatre is to be a true picture of humanity, actors must be able to say what is said in true life, and in the circumstances of life.\\" Brisbane Courier-Mail, 29 October 1969, p.8 Whalley taught well-known Australian actors, such as Judith McGrath, Sigrid Thornton, Penny Downie, Rowena Wallace, Russell Kiefel and Carol Burns.'Fitting Tribute to Incomparable Carol' Sunshine Coast Daily Apart from being Artistic Director of Twelfth Night Theatre, Whalley was also an accomplished actor. Before Twelfth Night Theatre was forced to give up its theatre at Gowrie Hall, purchased in 1956, in Wickham Terrace in central Brisbane due to its impending demolition to make way for the Turbot Street Expressway, Whalley appeared in the lead role in Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen.Radbourne, J., Little Theatre: Its development since World War Two, in Australia, Brisbane, 1978, p.251 She was responsible for the building of Twelfth Night Theatre complex at Bowen Hills, which opened in 1971. The Brisbane Courier-Mail featured a full page spread for the grand opening of \\"Twelfth Night's new $350,000 theatre complex at Bowen Hills\\".Brisbane Courier-Mail, 10 February 1971, p.15 Prior to the opening of the theatre, she directed a successful production of Under Milk Wood by Dylan Thomas in a tent where the theatre now stands. Whalley was also a foundation member of the Queensland Theatre Company's board and a contributor to the theatrical community in Brisbane. For many years Whalley directed the Lord Mayor of Brisbane's Christmas in Storyland Pantomime at the Brisbane City Hall. Honours On 10 June 2002, Whalley was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II. The citation read: \\"For service to the performing arts as an actor, teacher, director, artistic director and administrator.\\" Later life After leaving her position at Twelfth Night Theatre, Whalley maintained an active interest in theatre. For a time she held the position of Director of the Eastern Region of the Queensland Arts Council. Personal life Joan Whalley was married to the late Stuart Benson.

Postage stamps Antioquia became a sovereign state in 1858, by recognition as Estado de la Federaci√≥n in the constitution of the Granadine Confederation. Antioquia issued its first postage stamps on September 1 1868. A postal exchange agreement with the sovereign state of Bol√≠var was established a few years later.

The small quantity of stamps issued, the lithographic printing and the variety of papers used make Antioquia a very special and interesting area of Colombian philately. With many stamps no complete sheet exists and with some stamps the largest multiple is only a pair. There was often a very small quantity of stamps printed, only 258 of some and no more than 1,000 of others. Covers of that period are even scarcer than the classic Colombian covers that are recorded.

He is best known as the younger brother of Gregory of Nazianzus. He is recognized as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Church. Biography The younger son of Gregory the Elder, bishop of Nazianzus, and his wife, Nonna, Caesarius was born at the family villa of Arianzus, near Nazianzus. He probably studied at Caesarea Mazaca in Cappadocia in preparation for the elite schools of Alexandria in Egypt. His favourite studies there were geometry, astronomy and especially medicine. In the last-named science, he surpassed all his fellow students.Weber, Nicholas. \\"St. Caesarius of Nazianzus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 8 Mar. 2014 About 355 he came to the imperial capital Constantinople, and had already acquired a great reputation for his medical skill, when his brother Gregory, homeward bound from Athens, appeared there about 358. Caesarius sacrificed a remunerative and honourable post to return home with Gregory. The capital soon proved to be too great an attraction for him, and he eventually became an eminent physician at the Byzantine court of Constantius II and, much to the regret of his family, at that of Julian the Apostate.Monks of Ramsgate. ‚ÄúCaesarius of Nazianzum‚Äù. Book of Saints, 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 19 September 2012 Julian failed in his efforts to win him over to briefly restored Paganism. Caesarius, more appreciative of his faith than of imperial favour, ultimately left the court, but returned to Constantinople after Julian's death in 363. Under the Emperor Valens Caesarius became quaestor of Bithynia, a position which included treasury and tax collection responsibilities.McGuckin (2001), p. 155 After escaping from the earthquake which shook Nicaea (11 October, 368), his brother wrote to him, pleading for him to leave his political position and withdraw to a religious life.McGuckin (2001), pp. 155-156 However, Caesarius was suddenly killed by the widespread plague which followed the earthquake, shortly after having received baptism, which he, like many others at the period, had deferred until late in life. After his death, his very considerable estate was rapidly pillaged by servants and creditors.McGuckin (2001), p. 4 His brother Gregory insisted that what remained of the estate be distributed to the poor and to surviving relatives. His remains were interred at Nazianzus, where his brother pronounced the funeral oration in the presence of his parents. In the oration, \\"On His Brother: St. Caesarius\\", Gregory portrays his brother as a model Christian and ascetic, providing the main source for the details of his life and setting the groundwork for his eventual canonization.McGuckin (2001), p. 156 Biographer John McGuckin maintains that, while Caesarius and his brother Gregory were very close, they were very different characters. While Gregory pursued a religious life, his vivacious, outgoing brother was at home in the world of Byzantine politics.McGuckin (2001), p. 31 The two were complementary figures; Gregory relied on his brother to guide him through trouble, while Caesarius encouraged his brother's literary and rhetorical interests. The assertion that this Caesarius was the same as that Caesarius, Prefect of Constantinople, who in 365 was thrown into the prison by Procopius, rests on an assumption made by Jacques Godefroy (1587-1652), the editor of the Theodosian Code (Lyon, 1665), and not on any solid historical ground. The four Dialogues of one hundred and ninety-seven questions and answers which were traditionally ascribed to Caesarius and are to be found in Migne, Patrologia Graeca, XXXVIII, 851-1190, can hardly be from his pen, owing to their nature, contents and anachronisms. They are generally looked upon as spurious. In fiction Caesarius was the main character in a historical novel Gods and Legions, by Michael Curtis Ford (2002). The novel, which tells the story of the rise and fall of Julian the Apostate, is narrated by Caesarius who is, according to the story, his closest companion. NotesReferences * McGuckin, John A.

Recording and production The Jimi Hendrix Experience began and finished work on the recording for \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" at London's Olympic Sound Studios on October 29, 1967, the penultimate day of recording for Axis: Bold as Love on which the songs \\"Up from the Skies\\", \\"Bold as Love\\", \\"One Rainy Wish\\" and \\"EXP\\" were also completed. As with the rest of the album, \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" was produced by Chas Chandler and engineered by Eddie Kramer, and was mixed at Olympic on October 31. Composition and lyrics Writing the Hendrix biography Jimi Hendrix: Electric Gypsy, commentators Harry Shapiro and Caesar Glebbeek summarise \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" as \\"a sharply observed reflection on life's bitter ironies\\". Addressing the lyrics of the song, Shapiro and Glebbeek go on to discuss the significance of sand within the track as a metaphor \\"for the temporary nature of existence, of time slipping away, how nothing can be taken for granted ‚Äì love, loyalty, family bonds, [and] friendship\\". It is claimed that \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" is one of Hendrix's more obviously biographical songs, said to be written about his uncertain and transitional childhood involving \\"different homes, different schools, different careers and a mother who was here one minute and gone the next\\". Hendrix's brother, Leon Hendrix, has commented that the lyrics allude to their father's alcoholism, Leon being taken away so suddenly by Child Protective Services without announcement, and the abusive relationship between their parents (or from stories told by their grandmother, who was half- Cherokee). Writer Tom Maginn for AllMusic outlines the lyrical delivery of the song: Musically, \\"The track begins with overdubbed backwards guitar creeping in, as Hendrix lays down his signature clean guitar sound\\", drawing comparison with fellow Axis: Bold as Love track \\"Little Wing\\". According to Maginnis, \\"The backwards-recorded guitar ... [creates] a dreamy atmosphere and [lends] the song its distinctive character\\", with fellow band members Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding providing a \\"laid-back groove\\" with their \\"mid-tempo drum shuffle\\" and \\"concise bass line\\", respectively. Similarly, Chris Jones of the BBC also notes the \\"signature backwards guitar\\" in the song. Reception Writing a five-star review of the album for Allmusic, Cub Koda has cited \\"Castles Made of Sand\\", along with \\"Little Wing\\", \\"One Rainy Wish\\" and \\"Bold as Love\\", as evidence of Jimi Hendrix's \\"remarkable growth and depth as a tunesmith, harnessing Curtis Mayfield soul guitar to Dylanesque lyrical imagery and Fuzz Face hyperactivity to produce yet another side to his grand psychedelic musical vision\\", describing it as a \\"beautiful, wistful ballad\\". Speaking about the track specifically, fellow Allmusic commentator Tom Maginnis cites \\"Castles Made of Sand\\" as evidence that, in writing material for The Experience's second album, \\"Hendrix [was] becoming a songwriter of depth, while unafraid to make use of the latest studio technology available to him\\". Legacy A live recording by funk rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers is included as the B-side to 1989 single \\"Taste the Pain\\" and later on 1994 compilation Out in L.A.. Tom Maginnis of AllMusic calls it a \\"largely faithful tribute where guitarist John Frusciante displays a considerable Hendrix influence\\". The band also recorded another version, which is included as a bonus track on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Other artists who recorded the song include Tuck & Patti in 1989, electronic musician Four Tet in 2004, R&B; singer-songwriter Chaka Khan in 2007, and rock guitarist Richard Lloyd in 2009.

He served one term as the mayor of Philadelphia from 1899 to 1903. He was one of the mayors excoriated in Shame of the Cities, a series by muckraker Lincoln Steffens on municipal corruption. A report by the Philadelphia Municipal League referred to his administration as ‚Äúa crew of municipal pirates.‚Äù Early life Ashbridge was born in Philadelphia on December 5, 1848 to a Quaker family. Early on he worked as a clerk for a mercantile business and a coal yard. He later had his own coal business. In 1893, he became a deputy coroner in Philadelphia and won election as coroner in 1896. Political career Known as \\"Stars and Stripes Sam\\" for his predilection to give patriotic speeches, Ashbridge won the 1899 election for mayor, defeating Democrat Horace Hoskins with 145,778 votes, over 84% of the vote, out of 172,940 votes cast. He was closely associated with political bosses Matthew Quay and Israel Wilson Durham. Contemporary sources painted Ashbridge as one of the most corrupt mayors in Philadelphia history. In 1903, Lincoln Steffens in Philadelphia: Corrupt and Contented wrote that Ashbridge had accumulated $40,000 in debt that got satisfied right before the election. Steffens relayed an account of a conversation with former Postmaster General Thomas Hicks in which Ashbridge said \\"Tom, I have been elected mayor of Philadelphia. I have four years to serve. I have no further ambitions. I want no other office when I am out of this one, and I shall get out of this office all there is in it for Samuel H. Ashbridge.\\" In 1901, the Quay ring pushed bills that would create new streetcar lines in Philadelphia and would ultimately hand the franchises for those lines to his affiliates. Wealthy merchant John Wanamaker offered $2.5 million (according to Steffens; the New York Times reported $5 million) for those rights but Ashbridge threw his offer letter away. and awarded the streetcar rights to a Quay/Durham associate, John Mack. Reportedly, Quay's associates were angry at coverage in the North America a local newspaper that was owned by Thomas Wanamaker, John's son. The crew attempted to intimidate Wanamaker into stopping attacks on the local machine; their methods included having Wanamaker watched by investigators. Wanamaker, rather than giving in, exposed the tactics and called for an investigation. Some highlights of Ashbridge's tenure as mayor include proposing what would become Roosevelt Boulevard, and throwing the ceremonial first pitch at the first baseball game played at Columbia Park. After leaving office, the became president of the Tradesmen's Trust Company. The Philadelphia Municipal League's 1905 report called out corruption from his administration on several fronts. It cited the use of police as a political arm, widespread use of patronage jobs with the city for supporters, election fraud, and \\"unprecedented\\" levels of awarding of contracts to politics and personal allies that occurred during the Ashbridge years. He died March 24, 1906 after a long illness at the age of 57. His net worth was an estimated $500,000 at the time of his death. He is buried at West Laurel Hill Cemetery.

V. Stanionis‚Äôs preface (‚ÄúAbout My Father‚Äù) to Vytautas Stanionis: Fotografios/Photographs. Born in Drisa on 27 February 1917, Stanionis was brought up in Kaunas. His mother died when he was young; his father then remarried but he too died when the son was only 16. Stanionis trained and worked as an accountant. He moved to Vilnius in 1940, but three years later became ill and was hospitalized for tuberculosis in Alytus. Stanionis married soon after the war, both working as an accountant and being treated in the hospital, and taking photographs in his spare time. When in 1946 the new internal Soviet passports required photographs of their bearers, Stanionis was authorized to take them. A white sheet was a sufficient backdrop, and Stanionis would often photograph two people together in order to reduce costs. A number of these photographs (uncut) survive. Stanionis would also take any other photographs on demand; some survive of Lithuanian partisans. In 1947 he got a job in a regional newspaper, and was a popular photographer, although his work was hindered by his poor health. Photographs recently exhibited and republished show people more or less stiffly standing or sitting for photographs they had requested, plus Soviet rallies and rituals (some with floats eerily reminiscent of demonstrations of US civic pride), the river Nemunas (particularly in flood), and people unselfconsciously going about their business. The strain worsened Stanionis's health, and he went briefly to the Crimea in the hope of recuperating. His health soon deteriorated again after his return to Alytus, and in 1960 he went again to Crimea, this time to the resort of Sosniak. Here he was able to become photographer for the Nikitsky Botanical Garden; his botanical work was exhibited in Yalta, Kiev and Moscow. Stanionis died in Yalta on 11 May 1966. Stanionis's elder son, Vytautas V. Stanionis, would later become a professional photographer and the editor of his father's work. NotesBibliography * Stanionis, Vytautas. Dain≈≥ ≈°ventƒó.

Argentine Primera statisticsMLS player profile Early career in England Padula first moved to England when he joined Bristol Rovers in 1999, however he only joined on trial and didn't make an appearance for them. He then moved on to Walsall for whom he made 27 appearances in 1999‚Äì2000, and was voted their player of the season. However at the end of the season Walsall were relegated. Padula signed for Wigan Athletic in 2000, and at Wigan he scored his first goal in English football in a Football League Trophy tie against his former club Walsall. Queens Park Rangers After leaving Wigan in 2001 and spending a year in Argentina his most successful spell came at QPR, where he became somewhat of a cult hero. Padula was signed in 2002 by then QPR manager Ian Holloway who he had worked with during his spell at Bristol Rovers. He initially found it hard to break into the first team. Padula made his debut for the club as a substitute against Barnsley on 17 August 2002. His first start for QPR came on 2 November 2002 against Port Vale, however in the first half goalkeeper Simon Royce was sent off and substitute goalkeeper Fraser Digby was brought on for Padula. He eventually got his chance due to injuries from January 2003, and he finally started to display his tough slide tackling and steely determination. Padula became an overnight fan-favourite and one of the first names on the team sheet. As his confidence grew, he became more and more attacking and his prowess from dead balls became legendary with the QPR faithful. He scored his first goal for the club against Port Vale, the same team he was disappointingly substituted off against months earlier. Padula helped QPR to the 2003 Division Two playoff final which he started and performed solidly against Cardiff City at the Millennium Stadium. He was withdrawn in the 79th minute, being replaced by Tommy Williams. QPR lost the game one nil after extra time. The following season, Padula started 36 league games for QPR and scored 3 goals. QPR finished second only to Plymouth and won promotion back to the second tier of English football, the newly renamed Championship. Upon winning promotion on the final day of the season, beating Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 at Hillsborough, Padula danced in front of the 8000 travelling QPR fans, holding an Argentina flag. He remains one of the most popular modern-era QPR characters. Columbus Crew Padula and fellow Argentine, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, helped lead the Columbus Crew to the 2008 MLS Supporters Shield and 2008 MLS Cup. They repeated as Supporters' Shield winners in 2009. Coaching Following his retirement in 2011, he established Sporting Padula Soccer Academy in Westerville, Ohio, spsocceracademy.com.

Born in Manhattan, Mammes moved with his family to Rockaway Park, Queens around 1920. His father owned an ice cream parlor, where Mammes worked as a youth. Taking place during the Depression, many thought the 1932 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, was going to be an economic failure. Even so, after a few film stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford volunteered to entertain, 37 countries sent over 1300 athletes to the games. They were a huge success. This was the first time an Olympic Village would be built for the games, and competitors such as Babe Didrikson, Eddie Tolan and Luigi Beccali made headlines. Mammes won a position as a cyclist, and placed 8th in the 1000m time trial with a time of 1 hour and 18 minutes. Answering the call of his country, he entered the American Armed Forces, where he served as a Staff Sergeant in World War II. In 1945, he married Nancy, and had four children. After being discharged, he returned to New York, partnering with his father in Mammes' Ice Cream, which had become well known in Rockaway. Until 1968, he worked in the parlor from May through September, while working at Hegarty and Co., from which he retired after 25 years. From 1975 until his final retirement in 1998 at age 86, Mammes worked at Gateway National Park's Breezy Point Unit at Riis Park.

First stamps The first stamp issued specifically for the territory was a two-shilling blue stamp with a design of explorers and an Antarctic map, as shown in the adjacent picture. This was first issued in Australia on 27 March 1957 and in Antarctica on 11 December 1957.Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas. London: Macdonald, 1986, p.331. Used stamps Used stamps from the territory are usually found with either mainland Australia postal cancels, or first-day cover cancels as there is relatively little genuine mail from the bases. Bases The Australian Antarctic Territory bases are: * Casey Station * Davis Station * Heard Island * Macquarie Island Station * Mawson Station * Wilkes Station (now closed) All AAT mail will be cancelled with a postmark from one of these bases, though First Day Covers are now thought to be cancelled with the relevant base name at the Australian Philatelic Bureau, and not all bases are currently in use or permanently occupied.

Its main purpose is to foster sound development of the general insurance industry and to uphold the rights and interests of its members as well as the insurance policyholders. Its headquarters is located in Jongno-gu, Seoul, Korea.  History  The GIAK was established in 1946 as \\"Chosun Non-Life Insurance Association\\". In 1948, it was officially incorporated as \\"Korean Non-Life Insurance Association\\". In 2007, its name was changed to that of today.  Goals and activities  The GIAK's stated goals for service to the public include: * Improve systems concerning general insurance * Participate in insurance-related international bodies * Disclose the business performances of the member companies * Promote traffic safety campaigns * Management of insurance solicitors The organization also operates services for consumer protection and advocacy, including an insurance consumer counseling center. The counseling center enlists insurance experts and attorneys to provide advice and handle consumer complaints. The center provides these services online, via a telephone call center, in person at their offices and through a mobile counseling center. Another goal is to decrease insurance fraud by educating involved governmental and healthcare industry bodies. One example of their pursuit of this goal was the Gwangju Regional Insurance Crimes Citizens' Joint Workshop, which was a conference focused on decreasing the high rate of health insurance crimes in Gwangju. As part of this conference, the organization presented awards to police and healthcare workers who actively prevented insurance fraud, including one Gwangju police officer who arrested 164 people involved in fraud. The GIAK also works alongside government agencies to facilitate communication with insurance companies during disaster events. For example, in the 2018 typhoon season, the organization provided assistance to the Ministry of Public Safety and Security by facilitating communication with vehicle insurance companies. If a parking area were flooded, the ministry or local governments could report vehicle numbers to the GIAK, who would manage communication with insurance companies. In some cases, vehicles in parking areas with a high flood risk could be moved to safer locations.

Another article in 2000 claimed that the area contained \\"vital electronic pathways that carry more than half of all traffic on the Internet. The region is home to more telecom and satellite companies than any other place on earth.\\" The Dulles Technology Corridor is a descriptive term for a string of communities that lie along and between Virginia State Route 267 (the Dulles Toll Road and Dulles Greenway), and Virginia State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike and Harry Byrd Highway). It especially includes the communities, from east to west, of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, Sterling, and Ashburn. These communities are in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, which are the second-highest and highest income counties in the U.S. as of 2011, coinciding with the national technology and local internet boom of the 1990s and local technology spending after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Internet infrastructure and data centers As of 2009, more than 50% of all U.S. Internet traffic travelled through Northern Virginia. In his book Tubes, author Andrew Blum calls Ashburn, Virginia--a community within the Dulles Technology Corridor--\\"the bullseye of America's Internet\\". The Dulles Technology Corridor serves as headquarters for domain name registrar Network Solutions and network infrastructure company Verisign. The region contains the Internet Society, and used to contain the mainframe that houses the master list of all Internet domain names. The Dulles Technology Corridor includes Ashburn, Virginia's \\"Data Center Alley\\", described by the Washington Business Journal as \\"an area that is quickly emerging as a national hub for data storage facilities\\". The corridor also has data centers in Sterling, Herndon, Reston, and Tysons Corner. The area is a growing home for major data centers including those of Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s US East region, where an estimated 70% of AWS IP addresses are housed. Wikimedia Foundation has its primary data center in the corridor.

As time went by, it gained significance as one of the city's symbols, and now forms a part of her coat of arms.  Design  The structure is a pyramidal one. The statue on top represents a female figure, who is holding a sword in her left hand, while pointing with her right hand to the direction from where the national liberators arrived. One of the two bronze lions at the base is tearing the yoke chains with his mouth, whilst the other defends the Shield of Freedom. There are reliefs of resistance scenes on the pedestal. Two cannons are placed at the rear.  History  The exact year of opening is not known for certain -- 1906, 1908, and 1909 have been suggested, based on labels, photographs, and the Encyclopedia of fine arts in Bulgaria (). All sources cite the date 11 August, though. The booklet The revolutionaries' monument in Rousse claims to have proven that the correct year is 1909. The fundamental stone was put in 1890 in the Youth Park, where it was inaugurated by mitropolit Grigoriy in the presence of knyaz Ferdinand I. Five years later, the municipality and the organization of resistance heroes decided to move the place of the monument to the city garden, a former Turkish cemetery, which had been transformed into the city's new central square. At that time, the garden had an iron fence and used to be locked at night. The square was initially named Knyaz Boris after the recently born successor of the throne. After the monument's construction was completed, it was renamed to Botev square, then after 9 September 1944, when the communists came to power, it became the Lenin square, and later finally got its present name -- the Freedom square. In the end of 1895, a contract was signed with Stoycho Raychev Kefsizov, a local entrepreneur and former revolutionary, to build the monument for 65,000 leva. Despite Kefsizov's energy and devotion, the money did not suffice and the remainder to the new cost of 150,000 leva had to be collected as voluntary donations from evening balls all over Bulgaria. The Simeonovi brothers (Ivan Simeonov and Stefan Simeonov), who were famous innovative bankers, rendered a decisive support of 50,000 leva. The initial design by architect Simeon Zlatev featured a statue of the \\"Tsar Liberator\\" (Alexander II of Russia) on top, and two statues of revolutionaries with guns at the base. In 1907 the Rousse society decided to replace the tsar's statue with a statue of a woman, symbolizing freedom, in order not to resemble the Monument to the Tsar Liberator in Sofia, opened in the same year and also a work of Arnoldo Zocchi. Ferdinand I, who had shortly been re-titled from a knyaz to a tsar after the Unification of Bulgaria, was asked to determine the monument's opening day. He didn't reply, so 11 August was chosen, as it was the climax date of the Battle of Shipka. The ceremony started three days earlier. It was attended by many former revolutionaries' from other Bulgarian cities, including Rayna Knyaginya, as well as by officials, such as the prime minister Aleksandar Malinov, the ministers of justice and of foreign affairs, military generals, religious leaders, and the Russian consul. Tsar Ferdinand I only sent a representative, possibly because of the difficult relations between Russia and the throne.

Reconstruction, Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. An astrarium, also called a planetarium, is the mechanical representation of the cyclic nature of astronomical objects in one timepiece. It is an astronomical clock. History=Greek and Roman World The Antikythera mechanism (main fragment)The first astraria were mechanical devices. Archimedes is said to have used a primitive version that could predict the positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the planets. On May 17, 1902, an archaeologist named Valerios Stais discovered that a lump of oxidated material, which had been recovered from a shipwreck near Antikythera, held within it a mechanism with cogwheels. This mechanism, known as the Antikythera mechanism, was recently redated to end of the 2nd century BCE. Extensive study of the fragments, using X-rays, has revealed enough details (gears, pinions, crank) to enable researchers to build partial replicas of the original device. Engraved on the major gears are the names of the planets, which leaves little doubt as to the intended use of the mechanism. By the end of the Roman Empire, the know-how and science behind this piece of clockwork was lost. Middle Ages and Renaissance The first modern documented astrarium clock was completed in 1364 by Giovanni de' Dondi (1318‚Äì1388), a scholar and physician of the Middle Ages interested in astronomy and horology. The original clock, consisting of 107 wheels and pinions, has been lost, perhaps during the sacking of Mantua in 1630, but de' Dondi left detailed descriptions which have survived, enabling a reconstruction of the clock. It displays the mean time, sidereal, (or star), time and the motions of the sun, moon and the five then-known planets Venus, Mars, Saturn, Mercury, and Jupiter. It was conceived according to a Ptolemaic conception of the solar system. De' Dondi was inspired by his father Jacopo who designed the astronomical clock in the Piazzi dei Signori, Padua, in 1344 ‚Äì one of the first of its type. In later ages more astraria were built. A famous example is the Eise Eisinga Planetarium built in 1774 by Eise Eisinga from Dronrijp, Friesland, the Netherlands. It displayed all the planets and was fixed to the ceiling in a house in Franeker where it can still be visited.

It occurs throughout central and south-eastern Europe (with the exception of the far north) and in Asia Minor and the Caucasus further east to the Urals and Siberia. It is fairly common throughout Great Britain with the exception of northern Scotland. In the southern Alps, it rises up to 1500 metres. The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1767. Description The wingspan is 30‚Äì35 mm. It is green, sometimes more, sometimes less bluish, mixed with whitish, the forewing with two, the hindwing with one dark green transverse line, varying in intensity and in exact position; submarginal line thick, whitish. The variation agrestaria Duponchel is nearly unicolorous, the dark lines being entirely effaced. It possibly tends to form a local race in some places (as southern France) but certainly occurs in others together with the type. The variation virellata Krulikovsky, from eastern Russia, perhaps truly a local race, would appear, from its author's description, to be closely similar to the last-named form, but larger and probably darker, less mixed with white. As fasciata ab. nov. [Prout] may be described as a handsome form of occasional occurrence (at least in Britain) with the lines of forewing somewhat approximated and the area between them considerably darker than the ground colour.Prout, L.B. 1912‚Äì16.

Pupa of moderate width, tapering anteriorly; light brown, clay coloured or greenish, irregularly dark spotted, supraanal plate long. Rests in a very slight cocoon formed of a few threads among leaves. Biology It can be found in such habitats as heathland, moorland, and commons, where its larvae feed on broom, gorse and petty whin.

It is based on the 1945 novel Arch of Triumph by Erich Maria Remarque, which he wrote during his nine-year exile in the United States. Synopsis Pre-World War II Paris is crowded with illegal refugees, trying to evade deportation. One of them is Dr. Ravic (Charles Boyer), who under a false name practices medicine illegally, helping other refugees. He saves Joan Madou (Ingrid Bergman) from committing suicide after the sudden death of her lover. They become involved, but he is deported and she becomes the mistress of a wealthy man, Alex (Stephen Bekassy). All this time Ravic seeks revenge against the Nazi officer Haake (Charles Laughton), with war eventually declared between France and Germany.

Alidze Background and production The film's name is a reference to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, where the film is set. The rough cut of the film was four hours long, and in reducing it to two hours several actors were cut. Irwin Shaw spent five months writing the screenplay, but quit when Lewis Milestone wanted him to add a love story. Milestone then rewrote the script himself together with Harry Brown. Ingrid Bergman's salary for the part was $175,000 + 25% of net profits. William Conrad, in just his fourth film, has a small important (uncredited) role, as a policeman. The MPAA's head of the Production Code Administration at the time, Joseph Breen, made the film's studio tone down the violence in the script. The scene where Ravic kills Haake also included him stuffing Haake in the car's trunk, stripping him naked, burying him and burning his clothes ‚Äî this was cut from the film. Breen also objected to the murder going unpunished, but relented. Breen's initial objection contradicted the novel which made clear that Haake was a torturer whose many victims included Ravic and a girl he loved. In 1985, under the same title, the film was remade as a made-for-television movie with Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Ravic.

Nested within the central valleys of Penang Island, it is located approximately southwest of the city centre. Ayer Itam is one of the well-known places to sample Penang cuisine, and includes a handful of major tourist attractions such as Penang Hill and Kek Lok Si Temple. The area now known as Ayer Itam was first developed in the late 18th century, soon after the founding of Penang Island by Captain Francis Light in 1786. British officials intended to turn Ayer Itam, including Penang Hill, into an agricultural area and established spice farms. To this day, fruits and vegetables are still grown at the hills of Ayer Itam; fresh produce are then brought downhill daily to the wet markets throughout George Town.  Etymology  Air Itam got its name from the murky waters of the Air Itam River (Malay: Sungai Air Itam). The phrase 'Air Hitam' means black water in Malay. Suffolk House in 1811 Suffolk House Kek Lok Si Temple is said to be the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia and among the more famous ones in the country. The Chinese Anti-War Memorial at Air Itam is where some 800 victims of the Sook Ching massacres during World War II were laid to rest.  History  Soon after the founding of Penang Island in 1786, British East India Company officials, led by Captain Francis Light, began exploring and clearing the interior of the island for agricultural purposes. Pepper and nutmeg farms were then established at the hills of Air Itam, while Light also commissioned the planting of strawberries at Penang Hill. The Anglo-Indian Suffolk House, one of Light's residences, was also built within a pepper estate by the Air Itam River. The agricultural village of Air Itam grew throughout the 19th century, populated by farmers who owned the fruit and vegetable farms at the surrounding hills. To this day, fruits and vegetables are still produced at the hills of Air Itam and then distributed daily to the wet markets all over George Town. In 1890, construction of the Kek Lok Si Temple, now one of the largest Buddhist temples in Southeast Asia, commenced. Its main pagoda combines Chinese, Siamese and Burmese styles. The temple was finally opened to the public in 1905. Air Itam was once home to the Penang Zoological Gardens, the first zoo in Malaysia. Supposedly opened in the 1920s by a monk named Fa Kong, the zoo was shut down for good prior to World War II due to the excessive maintenance costs. The Great Air Itam Fire of 1935 destroyed more than 100 homes in the area. At the time, the residences in Air Itam were mostly wooden; this incident led to the construction of brick buildings in Air Itam. The area was also a hinterland which hid refugees fleeing from the episodes of violence that had occasionally erupted in George Town. For instance, the Penang Riots of 1867 forced some residents in George Town to evacuate to Air Itam. World War II, however, brought even greater numbers of refugees to Air Itam. During the war, when the Imperial Japanese Army implemented the Sook Ching purges, Air Itam became one of the sites where Chinese civilians were massacred. The urbanisation of Air Itam since the 1950s has brought about a concurrent increase in living standards and transformed the landscape with more high rises, making Air Itam one of the more densely populated areas on Penang Island. A new township named Farlim was also developed to the southeast in the 1980s.  Geography  Located in the valley between Batu Lanchang Hill, Bukit Penara and Penang Hill, this suburb of George Town is connected to the city by two main roads, Air Itam Road and Batu Lanchang Lane. It is also connected to Paya Terubong and the south of the island via Paya Terubong Road. The suburb covers a broad area that incorporates Farlim, Thean Teik Estate, Rifle Range, Kampung Bahru, Kampung Melayu, Hill Railway Road and Hye Keat Estate, extending as far east as the junction with York Road.  Transportation  A Rapid Penang bus passing by the Air Itam Market at Air Itam Road.The peak of Penang Hill is accessible via the Penang Hill Railway, the sole rail system on Penang Island.Air Itam Road, which snakes its way from George Town proper all the way towards Paya Terubong, remains the major thoroughfare at Air Itam. With a total length of about , Air Itam Road is heavily used by motorists heading towards George Town, and Air Itam and Paya Terubong in the opposite direction. Other major roads, such as Batu Lanchang Lane, Thean Teik Road and Thean Teik Highway, have been widened to cope with the increasing traffic. Air Itam is also famous for Malaysia's only operating funicular rail system, the Penang Hill Railway. Designed and opened in the 1920s, this funicular rail, which climbs Penang's tallest hill, was originally equipped with Swiss coaches. It has since been upgraded twice - in 1977 and 2010. The present-day Swiss-made coaches have a capacity of and is capable of reaching the peak of Penang Hill from the base station in as little as five minutes. Rapid Penang buses 13, 200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 306 and 502 serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Air Itam with George Town to the northeast and other destinations on Penang Island, such as Paya Terubong, the Penang International Airport, Queensbay Mall and Balik Pulau.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/203.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/204.gif These routes are complemented by Rapid Penang's Congestion Alleviation Transport (CAT), a free-of-charge transit service within Air Itam. Another bus service that caters specifically to tourists is the Hop-On Hop-Off service, which utilises open-topped double-decker buses. The Hop-On Hop-Off service includes stops at Penang Hill Railway Station and Kek Lok Si Temple.  Education  Chung Ling High School A total of 10 primary schools, three high schools and a technical school are located within Air Itam. Notably, Air Itam is home to Chung Ling High School, one of the premier Chinese schools in Penang. Founded in 1917, it has retained the consistent academic performance of its students.

History Rejects Revenge was founded in Liverpool in 1990 by Ann Farrar, Tim Hibberd and David White. Ann studied English at Liverpool University; David was primarily a musician from Redditch who had come to Liverpool to seek fame and fortune in the home of the Beatles (they had unfortunately left by the time he arrived), and Tim moved from the Isle of Wight to study Medieval and Modern History. Ann and David met on a community theatre course at Hope Street; Tim met Ann when she joined The Network, an agit prop socialist theatre company based at the Trade Union Centre on Hardman Street. Their training consisted mainly of partaking in the numerous free workshops given by theatre practitioners at Hope Street in the late 1980s/ early 1990s, organised by Peter Ward. These companies and individuals, including Trestle, the right size, Th√©√¢tre de Complicit√©, Peta Lilly, Mime Theatre Project, would usually then perform at Liverpool's Unity Theatre under the directorship of Graeme Phillips. In 1990 The Everyman Theatre donated its space free for three nights for anyone on the Hope Street course who wished to perform. Ann asked Tim if he wished to create a piece based on the revolutions taking place in Eastern Europe at the time, and 'Staging The Revolution' became the first work they created together. David was introduced into the company later that year. Much of their work began as devised pieces, but unlike many devising companies of the time, they were keen to turn this into a strict performance script, normally written by Tim. Their work was often very physical, but the physicality of the words was always given equal weight. After 15 years of national and international touring the company fell foul of the 2005 Arts Council cuts, and created its final production in that year. The company's archive was preserved at the Museum of Liverpool Life.

The area was then cleared for agricultural plantations by David Brown, a partner of Captain Francis Light. Urbanisation of the area began in earnest in the 1960s, when residential estates were established within the area. Gelugor gradually turned into a suburb of George Town, helped by its strategic location right in the middle between George Town proper and Bayan Lepas to the south. In 1969, Universiti Sains Malaysia was founded at Gelugor and is now one of the top Malaysian public universities. In recent decades, Gelugor has assumed increased importance. In addition to hosting Penang Island's first university, the Penang Bridge, completed in 1985, was Penang's first cross-strait bridge, linking Gelugor with the Malay Peninsula.  Etymology  Gelugor was named after Garcinia atroviridis, known in Malay as asam gelugor.http://dict.youdao.com/m/gelugor/ Widely endemic in the Malay Peninsula, this species is especially cultivated on Penang Island for its medicinal properties.An 1818 painting of the view overlooking George Town and Gelugor. left  History  Gelugor was one of the first areas of Penang Island to be inhabited. Fishermen had moved into the area from Sumatra in the 18th century, predating Captain Francis Light's founding of Penang Island in 1786. They settled around the mouth of the Gelugor River (Malay: Sungai Gelugor) and Bukit Gelugor. Soon after Light came ashore in what is now George Town in 1786, his Scottish partner, David Brown, cleared the jungles around Gelugor to make way for agricultural purposes, including spice and coconut plantations. Brown also brought in labourers from India to work in the estates. He eventually became the largest landowner on Penang Island in the early 19th century. Up until the end of World War II, Gelugor remained a rural area. Prior to the war, the British Army converted one of David Brown's houses into the Glugor Barracks, to be renamed later as Minden Barracks. The army camp was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army during the war. It was again put in use during the Malayan Emergency and the Indonesian Confrontation, before being closed for good in 1971 following the withdrawal of all British armed forces from Southeast Asia. The development of residential estates at Gelugor began in the 1960s, originally to house civil servants. Also in the 1960s, a proposal to establish Penang's first university was mooted. Eventually, the Penang University () was founded in 1969, before being relocated to the former Minden Barracks in 1971. The university has since been renamed Universiti Sains Malaysia, now one of the foremost public universities in Malaysia. In 1985, the Penang Bridge that connects Gelugor with the Malay Peninsula was completed. The bridge has indirectly boosted urbanisation at Gelugor, which also lies right between George Town proper and the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone.  Transportation  The Penang Bridge runs between Gelugor and Perai on the Malay Peninsula. Gelugor is directly linked to Seberang Perai, the mainland halve of Penang, via the -long Penang Bridge. Upon its completion in 1985, the bridge was the longest in Southeast Asia; that title has since been passed on to the Second Penang Bridge further south. Nonetheless, the Penang Bridge remains a heavily used road link between Penang Island and the mainland, due to the higher toll charges on the longer Second Penang Bridge, and the older bridge's closer proximity to both George Town and Butterworth. Within the suburb, Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah serves as the main thoroughfare. In recent years, much of the pan-island and incoming traffic from the Penang Bridge have been diverted to the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, which runs along Gelugor's coastline as well. Rapid Penang buses 11, 13, 102, 206, 301, 302, 303, 304, 401 and AT (Airport Transit) serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Gelugor with George Town to the north and other destinations on Penang Island, such as the Penang International Airport, Batu Lanchang, Air Itam, Tanjung Bungah and Balik Pulau.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/11.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/13.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/at.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/102.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/206.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/301.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/302.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/303.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/304.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/401.gif In addition, a cycling lane has been installed along the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway as part of the move to encourage cycling as a form of alternative transportation. This -long cycling lane extends from George Town proper towards Queensbay Mall, south of the Penang Bridge.

Primary schools * SRK Sungai Gelugor * SRK Bukit Gelugor * SRK Minden Height High schools * SMK Bukit Gambir * SMK Datuk Hj. Mohamed Nor Ahmad Gelugor is home to one of the top Malaysian public universities, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). It was ranked fifth within Malaysia by the QS World University Rankings . USM is also the only university in Malaysia to be accorded the APEX University status by the Malaysian federal government and one of the handful autonomous universities nationwide. In addition, a teachers' training institution run by the Malaysian federal government, Institut Pendidikan Guru Pulau Pinang, is situated within Gelugor as well.  Shopping  Udini Square, the newest shopping mall at GelugorThe sole shopping mall within Gelugor is Udini Square, which was opened in 2015. The mall, anchored by two sporting good chains, specialises in household hardware and sporting equipment. Udini Square is also complemented by a Tesco store located opposite the mall; the two adjacent shopping complexes are connected via an overhead pedestrian bridge. Another commercial complex, named e-Gate, is situated next to both Udini Square and the Tesco outlet, facing the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway. This complex houses a number of high-end eateries and electronics stores, such as Subway and OldTown White Coffee.  Infrastructure  Arte S, the third tallest skyscraper in Penang, is situated within Gelugor. Gelugor Power Plant Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia's main electric utility firm, operates a power plant at the coast of Gelugor. Running primarily on oil, the Gelugor Power Station generates 398MW of electricity. The newly created Light neighbourhood at the coast of Gelugor contains a linear park equipped with a cycling track. Individual marinas have also been built within this seafront residential neighbourhood. Future developments at Gelugor include the construction of a mixed-commercial and residential waterfront precinct, named The Light City. This project, a joint venture by Malaysia's IJM Land Berhad and Singapore's Perennial Real Estate Holdings, comprises a shopping mall and what will be Penang's largest convention centre, as well as luxury hotels and residential units.

Located south of the Pinang River, Jelutong has been inhabited since as early as the late 18th century, when traders from Aceh and India settled around the area. It was once notorious as a turf for gangsters and triads until the 1980s, when urbanisation transformed the area into a residential suburb of George Town.  Etymology  Jelutong was named after the Jelutong tree, known scientifically as Dyera costulata. It was believed that this species of trees was once abundant around the area now known as Jelutong.The Pinang River separates George Town proper to the north and its suburb of Jelutong to the south. Apartments such as these now occupy much of Jelutong's landscape.  History  Jelutong was already inhabited before the arrival of Captain Francis Light in 1786. Merchants from Aceh and India established resting places and villages along the mouth of Pinang River. In the mid-19th century, the then forested area was first cleared for agricultural purposes. Factories were set up much later in Jelutong, as the urban population spilled southward from George Town proper. In spite of industrialisation, some fishing communities continued to exist up until recently and charcoal makers still make a living from the mangrove swamps along the coast. The growing population in Jelutong led to rampant crime and thugs roaming the streets. It was only in the 1980s with a rise in the standards of living and urbanisation that Jelutong's criminal notoriety was eradicated. It was in the Jelutong parliamentary constituency where Karpal Singh, a prominent Malaysian lawyer, first entered the national political scene. The Democratic Action Party politician held the seat for over 20 years until 1999, earning him the nickname the 'Tiger of Jelutong'. Jelutong Road The Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway runs along the coastline of Jelutong. Visible in the horizon is the Penang Bridge.  Transportation  Jelutong's proximity to George Town, immediately north of the Pinang River that separates both locations, makes the suburb easily accessible from the city centre by road. Five bridges now traverse the Pinang River, linking the Jelutong suburb with the city centre. Historically, Jelutong Road serves as the main thoroughfare within the suburb, allowing motorists from the city centre to head south towards Bayan Lepas. In recent years, the completion of the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway has considerably reduced the daily traffic congestion along Jelutong Road, as motorists now use the coastal expressway to commute between George Town and Bayan Lepas, bypassing Jelutong Road entirely. Rapid Penang buses 11, 12, 301, 302, 303 and 401 serve the residents of the suburb, by connecting Jelutong with George Town to the north and other destinations within the southern side of Penang Island, including Bukit Jambul, Bayan Baru, Bayan Lepas, Batu Maung and Balik Pulau.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/11.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/12.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/301.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/302.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/303.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/401.gif In addition, a cycling lane has been installed within Jelutong as part of the move to encourage cycling as a form of alternative transportation.

It would have run from the Delaware Memorial Bridge in the Deepwater neighborhood of Pennsville Township to Ocean City. The freeway was to parallel U.S. Route 40 from its start, then run as a concurrency with Route 55 in Vineland. From there it would have continued east and ended at Ocean City. It was designed as a connection between South Jersey and points west via the Delaware Memorial Bridge. However, the nearby Atlantic City Expressway, combined with a fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s, prevented the freeway from being built. Despite the plans for the freeway being shelved, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) hasn't officially taken it off their route log. Route 60 along with Route 74 are the only remaining unbuilt freeways left on the New Jersey State Legislature.  History  Route 60 was designated in 1953 as a proposed freeway from Verga via Barrington to Bridgeboro. This was realigned and was later designated as part of I-295. Facing a dilemma due to the increase in automobile traffic after World War II, the New Jersey State Highway Department brought together a proposed set of freeways across the state of New Jersey in 1960. One proposal set forth was of a freeway connecting Deepwater to Ocean City, paralleling the alignment of U.S. Route 40\\\\. From the community of Millville to Vineland, Route 60 was proposed to be concurrent with the also proposed Route 55\\\\. From there, the highway was supposed to head eastward to the U.S. Route 9 Expressway near Ocean City, New Jersey. The design of the freeway was to help improve urbanization through places such as Millville and Vineland, along with providing access for people from Delaware, Maryland, and southeastern Pennsylvania to the southern portions of the Jersey Shore. The New Jersey Department of Transportation did estimate construction of the freeway to cost $116 million (1967 USD), however, difficulties in the economy along with the close proximity of the nearby Atlantic City Expressway killed the project from moving forward. Since the 1970s, proposals have arisen to revive the Route 60 freeway. In 2007, the Western/Southern Cumberland Regional Planning proposed a new freeway spur from the constructed Route 55 Freeway to the community of Bridgeton, New Jersey following the general alignment of current day County Route 552\\\\. This same study indicates a need for a limited access interstate freeway from the Delaware Memorial Bridge to Atlantic City, New Jersey. In February 2010, Assemblywoman Celeste Riley proposed the revival of the Route 60 freeway via a study of the lack of transportation in Bridgeton. The study would also look into the best transportation between the Delaware Memorial Bridge and Atlantic City. However, local officials believe these proposals may not form into reality due to local opposition.

The road is also famous for the street cuisine at the seafront's hawker centre and has been listed as one of the 25 best streets worldwide to visit by the Australian travel magazine, The Traveler. In addition, Gurney Drive has become part of George Town's second Central Business District due to the mushrooming of skyscrapers and shopping malls. Previously known as the New Coast Road, it was completed in 1936 along what was then known as the North Beach, and renamed in 1952 after Sir Henry Gurney, British High Commissioner in Malaya (1950‚Äì1951), who was assassinated by the guerrillas of the Malayan Communist Party during the Malayan Emergency. Over the years, the beaches along Gurney Drive have largely been lost to coastal erosion. More recently, a land reclamation project at nearby Tanjung Tokong has reversed the erosion, leading to the accretion of silt and mud off Gurney Drive. Mangrove saplings have sprouted in the mud, which is now frequented by egrets and other birds as well as mudskippers. As of 2016, the shoreline off Gurney Drive is being reclaimed for the purpose of creating a public recreational park named Gurney Wharf. History Gurney Drive sits on a reclaimed land created off Teluk Ayer Rajah, the bay that once existed between George Town and Tanjung Tokong. The intention to build a coastal road was already planned as early as 1930 as an extension of Northam Road (now Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah). The first of Gurney Drive was completed in 1934, and at that time, it was simply named \\"North Beach\\". Gurney Drive was initially named as New Coast Road. It was then renamed Gurney Drive in honour of Sir Henry Gurney, the British High Commissioner in Malaya who had been assassinated by communist guerrillas in Pahang in 1951. However, a few years later, a debate erupted over the renaming of Gurney Drive. It was proposed that, with the independence of Malaya imminent at the time, Gurney Drive should be renamed Merdeka Drive. To compensate for the renaming of the road, a bust of the late Sir Henry Gurney was to be constructed. The Municipal Commissioners who opposed the renaming of Gurney Drive then wrote directly to Gurney's wife, who was said to have taken 'the change very bravely and even offered to help with regard to the statue or bust'. A sculptor in London, David McFall, offered to create the bust for $4,500. When the recommendation for the provision of $6,000 for the bust was reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council, it was eventually decided to not only to defer the provision of the bust but also that the drive should continue to be called Gurney Drive. In 1962, a section of Gurney Drive was planted with casuarina trees. A councillor subsequently suggested that the City Council should consider renaming Gurney Drive into \\"Casuarina Drive\\" or \\"Casuarina Beach\\". The suggestion was never implemented, and today, the section where the casuarina trees were planted remain a distinct, leafy part of the seaside promenade. Gurney Drive was once a sandy beach where people could collect seashells i.e. siput remis or small mussels which were abundant back then. The sea water was so clean and pollution-free that it became a venue for dragon boat races from the 1960s to 1980s. Back then people would swim in the sea and fishermen would return to the beach with their catches, especially for fishes and king crabs along the shore. However, such excitement of these events and the clear water is much lost now. The Seri Tanjung Pinang land reclamation project at nearby Tanjung Tokong had led to an accumulation of silt and mud along Gurney Drive, thus allowing mangrove trees to grow along the shoreline. Until recently, there were suggestions that this area, formerly earmarked for reclamation under the suspended Penang Outer Ring Road project, be reclaimed for a recreational park or allowed to be developed into a mangrove forest. Gurney Drive is home to many prominent pre-war houses, colonial bungalows and the College General Complex, which was once used to train Catholic priests in Thailand, India, China, Japan and Myanmar. In addition, two famous shopping malls - Gurney Plaza and Gurney Paragon - as well as numerous high-rise hotels and condominiums, are located along Gurney Drive. Land reclamation is also currently ongoing off Gurney Drive to create Gurney Wharf, a proposed public recreational park which will include a food and beverages (F&B;) area, a man- made beach and water gardens. The first phase of the project is slated for completion by 2018. Landmarks Gurney Plaza, one of the most popular shopping malls in George Town. Gurney Paragon consists of a shopping mall and a pair of condominiums, which rank among the tallest skyscrapers in Penang. Affluent beach-side bungalows were located here, many of which are today incorporated into the design of upscale condominiums. At the Pangkor Road end of Gurney Drive was the fabulous mansion of Kapitan China Chung Thye Phin, son of Kapitan China Chung Keng Quee, occupied today by One Persiaran Gurney condominiums. While Gurney Drive has some of the most modern skyscrapers in Penang, it is also where opulent bungalows of the colonial era still stand. One of these is the Loke Mansion. Also at Gurney Drive is the St Joseph's Novitiate, which is now part of Gurney Paragon. Shopping centers *Gurney Plaza *Gurney Paragon Food Gurney Drive Hawker Centre is one of the largest and most well-known local eateries in Penang. It has been relocated a few times, and is presently located at the northern end of Gurney Drive, just before the Gurney roundabout, between Sunrise Tower and Gurney Plaza. The Gurney Drive Hawker Centre has been around since the early 1970s, and is probably the best known place for visitors to Penang to savour the local hawker fare. Over the years, the price at the hawker centre has risen higher than at coffee shops elsewhere in Penang, due to popularity of the hawker centre among out-of-town visitors and general commercialisation. Food sold at the hawker centre include char kuey teow, Hokkien mee, jiu hoo eng chye (spinach with cuttlefish), koay teow th'ng, lok lok, mee goreng, Jawa mee, mee rebus, pasembur, rojak, satay, soya beancurd (douhua) and many more.

His real name is Steve Cawood. Derkoi is an award- winning filmmaker and visual effects artist. Derkoi started playing the guitar after seeing the band Oasis's Live By The Sea concert on TV. First he started playing left handed but, after shopping around for an electric guitar, decided to learn right-handed as there was more choice. Over the years, Derkoi has written and recorded music on a Yamaha MT4X 4-track recorder and mastered onto minidisc before making the switch to a DAW, Cakewalk Sonar. He recorded his first album on the 4-track recorder whilst living in Withernsea. He called the collection of metal songs Collective Unconscious and named himself \\"Dividend\\". Originally only on cassette tape, he distributed the album around family and friends and later remastered the original minidisc masters to CD. Some years later, Derkoi recorded the title track for a DVD of the football team West Ham United F.C. after submitting the music to the production house, he was disappointed to hear that his track had been edited badly by the production house and was made to sound out of time. Derkoi formed his first band in 2005 called Above It All. They only played local Hull gigs and whilst had a small following, this was made up of largely the band's circle of friends. After playing in Above Ii All for a year, Derkoi decided to leave as he was not happy with the direction the band was taking, and he formed the industrial band Nervehammer. Nervehammer was received well and had a small hit with their song \\"Arena (Step Up)\\" which was played regularly in the Hull alternative nightclub, Spiders. After a few years of playing gigs and writing music, tension in Nervehammer grew to a point where Derkoi and his cousin Lee could no longer work together, and so Nervehammer split. He began writing music as a solo artist under the name of Derkoi, which was an old nickname for his parent's pet dog when he was growing up. Derkoi has released the single \\"Your Lies\\" in Celldweller's FiXT Music. He has also remixed artists Celldweller and Blue Stahli for FiXT Remix and Nine Inch Nails.

He appeared in 557 games as a first baseman, designated hitter and pinch hitter in Major League Baseball from 1978 to 1982 for four American League teams. He batted left-handed and threw right=handed, and was listed as tall and . Early career Born in Roseville, California, Revering graduated from Bella Vista High School. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the seventh round of the 1971 Major League Baseball Draft. Revering developed into a top prospect for the Reds, hitting as many as 29 home runs and driving in 110 runs for Indianapolis Indians in . On December 9, 1977, the Reds announced a deal in which they would acquire disgruntled Cy Young Award winning pitcher Vida Blue from the Oakland Athletics in exchange for Revering and $1.75 million. However, commissioner Bowie Kuhn vetoed the deal. A new deal was struck on February 25, in which the Reds sent Revering and cash to Oakland for Doug Bair. Oakland A's Upon his acquisition, Revering immediately assumed first base duties for the A's, batting .271 with sixteen home runs and 46 runs batted in his rookie season. The A's lost 108 games in , however, Revering emerged as something of a star for the lowly club, hitting nineteen home runs and driving in 77 (both career highs) while batting .288. For his career in Oakland, Revering batted .279 with 52 home runs and 195 RBIs. On May 20, , he, Mike Patterson and minor leaguer Chuck Dougherty were traded to the New York Yankees for Jim Spencer and Tom Underwood. New York Yankees Revering assumed Jim Spencer's job of backing up Bob Watson at first base. He batted .235 with two home runs and seven RBIs seeing limited action during the strike shortened season, however, he did make the post-season for the only time in his career. He made two appearances in the 1981 American League Division Series as a late inning defensive replacement, but did not have an at-bat. He logged two at-bats in the 1981 American League Championship Series against the A's, collecting a single in the Yankees' 13-3 game two victory. Though the Yankees reached the 1981 World Series, Revering did not make an appearance. 1982-83 A month into the season, the Yankees dealt Revering to the Toronto Blue Jays, with minor leaguers Tom Dodd and Jeff Reynolds for John Mayberry. In August, the Blue Jays offered Revering the choice of accepting a demotion to the minor leagues or his release; Revering picked the latter on August 2. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the Seattle Mariners; however, he was released at the end of the season. Revering joined the Detroit Tigers for spring training , but did not make the club. He was offered a minor league assignment, but chose to retire instead.

History  Mechanical or \\"wind vane\\" self-steering started out as a way to keep model sail boats on course. Before the advent of Radio Control, model yacht racing (started before WW1) was typically contested on long narrow ponds, and the number of stops along the banks was counted as a penalty in the final result. Initially a system of counterweight on the tillers was devised to compensate for the weather helm when the model boat heeled in a gust. These crude systems evolved in a more sophisticated system called Braine Gear after its inventor, George Braine. The Braine steering gear was a fine-tuned system of quadrant on the rudder stock driven by the tension of the mainsail sheet and damped by a rubber band. A more sophisticated system called the vane gear was later devised, it relied on a small vane or airfoil driving the main rudder via an adjustable system of clockwork gears. It was very similar to the later vane driven autopilots seen on transatlantic yachts such as Blondie Hasler's self steering rudder. Some transatlantic singlehanded sailors used a crude form of self steering devices to cross the Atlantic Ocean in the 1920s and 1930s, the most notable being Frenchman Marin Marie (Pierre Durand Coupel de Saint Front) who crossed the Atlantic twice in the 1930s, first on a sailing yacht called Winnibelle II and secondly on a motor pinnace called Arielle. Self steering aboard Winnibelle II on its Atlantic crossing from Douarnenez, France, to New York in 1933 was somewhat similar to a Braine gear, using twin jibs (Trinquettes jumelles) with their sheets connected to the rudder via an array of blocks and lines. The long keeled Winnibelle II was perfectly stable on course on close-hauled or beam reach points of sailing but the self steering twin jib system could take over in the trickier downwind broad reaches and running points of sailing. On the small motor pinnace Arielle, a 13-metre boat propelled by a 65HP French made Baudouin diesel engine which sailed from New York to Le Havre in 1936, the task of steering a motor boat in the Atlantic swells was more daunting. Arielle had two rudders; the main one under the hull, in the propeller race, was for manual steering and the smaller auxiliary rudder was transom mounted. This auxiliary rudder could be mechanically driven by a special wind vane mounted atop of the coachroof consisting of two rectangular airfoils set at an angle on a vertical axle and balanced by a counterweight. It was simple and worked quite well, but could not steer the boat in very light breezes or flat calm. While Marin Marie was fitting out Arielle in New York he was approached by a French inventor named Casel who offered to fit an electrical autopilot of his invention, free of charge. The Casel autopilot was using the then revolutionary photoelectric cells and a system of light and reflecting mirrors on the magnetic compass rose. Its principle is somewhat similar to modern day electronic autohelms, excepting the modern flux-gate sensor for autopilots system. The Casel autopilot, which included an array of green, red and white telltale control lights, used an electric motor to act on the main rudder. Though its basic principle was sound and was useful in some sections of the passage, it proved to be somewhat too lightly built for a wet vibrating little boat and was trouble ridden. Marin Marie, though appreciative in some occasions generally loathed the temperamental device, specially when he discovered that Casel had inadvertently hidden his stores of Bordeaux wine in the autopilot compartment, unwillingly condemning him to a teetotal Atlantic crossing of some 20 days.  Electronic  A tiller-pilot on a sailing boat - simple electronic self- steering. Electronic self-steering is controlled by electronics operating according to one or more input sensors, invariably at least a magnetic compass and sometimes wind direction or GPS position versus a chosen waypoint. The electronics module calculates the required steering movement and a drive mechanism (usually electrical, though possibly hydraulic in larger systems) causes the rudder to move accordingly. There are several possibilities for the interface between the drive mechanism and the conventional steering system. On yachts, the three most common systems are: * Direct drive, in which an actuator is attached to the steering quadrant, at the top of the rudder stock inside the boat. This is the least intrusive method of installation. * Wheel mounting, in which a motor is mounted near the steering wheel, and can be engaged with it when in use. This typically involves either a belt drive or a toothed gear-ring attached to the wheel itself, and is a common option for retro-fitted installations on yachts with a wheel. * Tiller-pilots are usually the only option on smaller vessels steered with a tiller. They consist of an electrically driven ram which is mounted between the tiller and a fitting on the side of the cockpit. Some are entirely self-contained, needing only a power supply, while others have the control unit separate from the actuator. These are quite popular, as they are maintenance-free and easy to install. Workings of a marine tiller-pilot Depending on the sophistication of the control unit (e.g. tiller pilot, steering wheel attached Chartplotter, ...), electronic self-steering gear can be programmed to hold a certain compass course, to maintain a certain angle to the wind (so that sailing boats need not change their sail trim), to steer towards a certain position, or any other function which can reasonably be defined. However, the amount of power required by electrical actuators, especially if constantly in action because of sea and weather conditions, is a serious consideration. Long-distance cruisers, which have no external source of electricity and often do not run their engines for propulsion, typically have relatively strict power budgets and do not use electrical steering for any length of time. As the electronic autopilot systems require electricity to operate, many vessels also make use of PV solar panels or small wind turbines on the boat. This eliminates extra pollution and cuts costs.  Mechanical  Yacht with highlighted self- steering device A windvane self-steering with auxiliary rudder and trim tab servo The main goal of a mechanical self-steering gear is to keep a sailboat on a given course towards the apparent wind and to free the helmsman from the steering job. An advantageous side effect is that the sails are kept in optimal angle towards the apparent wind and deliver optimal propulsion force by that. Even in sailboats running under engine, the self steering gear can be used to keep the boat heading into the wind to easily set or change sails (exception: sheet-to-tiller principle). As wind direction sensors are used a) a wind vane mounted on an axis being tilted more or less towards the horizon (wind vane self-steering) b) the pressure of the wind in the sail(s) and by that the force on the sheet (sheet to tiller self-steering). The different mechanical principles of coupling a change in apparent wind direction mechanically with a course changing actuator (rudder) can be roughly grouped: * Trimm-Tab (Flettner Servo tab) systems, wind vane coupled with a small flap attached at the main rudder, an auxiliary rudder or a servo pendulum rudder * vane to auxiliary rudder (Windpilot Atlantik, Hydrovane) with a wind vane directly coupled to an auxiliary rudder * vane to rudder (only applicable for very small boats, a large wind vane is directly coupled to the ship's rudder) * servo pendulum rudder (a wind vane turns an immersed blade around its vertical axis, the blade swings out to the side due to the movement through the water and turns the ship's rudder with that) * servo pendulum with auxiliary rudder (like above, but the servo pendulum blade acts on an auxiliary rudder and not on the ship's rudder) * sheet-to-tiller (a spring load at the tiller is counteracted by the pulling force of a foresail and/or main sail sheet)  Present day autopilots  Mechanical self-steering units are made by a number of manufacturers, but most systems produced today share the same principle (servo pendulum rudder, see below). As well as their requirement for electric power, many long-distance cruisers observe that electronic self-steering machinery is complex and unlikely to be repairable without spare parts in remote areas. By contrast the vane gear offers at least the possibility of an improvised repair at sea, and can usually be rebuilt on land using non-specific parts (sometimes plumbing parts) by a local welder or machinist. To minimize the speed loss by the self steering gear it is essential to have the vessel's sails balanced with little load on the rudder before any attempt is made to engage the self steering. With the sails are trimmed correctly, the force-balance of the servo oar and the main or auxiliary rudder is minimized that way, that the lowest angles of attack of rudder and servo oar towards the water flow are achieved. Some experimentation and judgement is usually needed, however, to determine the proper settings for a given vessel and steering mechanism. A popular source on contemporary windvane technology is The Windvane Self-Steering Handbook. One particularly valuable contribution of Morris's book is his coverage of the variety of alloys used in vane gear manufacturing. Morris admits to his practice of setting a kitchen timer for a half-hour at a time and sleeping while the windvane steering device controls the helm, even in head winds of 25 to 35 knots. In a recent interview, he said he once narrowly missed being hit by a huge freighter while sleeping on his sail up the Red Sea. Morris points out, \\"An autopilot wouldn't have made any difference in this case. If I had been using an electronic autopilot, that freighter still would have been there. I made a choice to sail two-thirds of my circumnavigation single-handed, and I accepted the risks that came with that decision. I guess fate was on my side.\\"  Trim-Tab  In former Trim-Tab servo systems, the pivot movement of the servo blade around its vertical axis has been carried out by a trim tab Servo tab, which however costs some force due to the fact, that the trim tab is moved in the opposite direction to turn the servo blade. The same holds for a trim tab, which is mounted at a big distance behind the ship's rudder, connected to it at its upper and lower end. This construction is called \\"The Saye's Rigg\\". Another version of wind vane self steering on sail boats is known as the vertical axis vane and usually, because of the inferior steering force output compared to Servo Pendulum devices it makes use of a trim tab hung off the rudder to control the course of the boat. The vane spins at right angles to the ground and can lock to the trim tab in any desired position, as the boat falls off the wind the vane will be turned by the wind and will take the trim tab with it which in turn causes the rudder to move in the opposite direction and thus corrects course. Generally self steering like this, with a trim tab can only be used on boats with transom (or aft hung double enders) rudders as the trim tab needs to be mounted directly to and aft of the rudder to produce the desired effect, and of course has to be controlled even as the rudder swings side to side. This is typically accomplished by use of a slotted bar in which the connection to the vane assembly can slide in as the rudder turns. These self steering systems are generally simpler and are thus easier to set and adjust course as they don't make use of lines controlling the rudder but control it more directly through solid linkages.Blondie Hasler Trim Tab Self Steering A related device has been used on some windmills, the fantail, a small windmill mounted at right angles to the main sails which automatically turns the heavy cap and main sails into the wind, (invented in England in 1745). (When the wind is already directly into the main vanes, the fantail remains essentially motionless.)  Vane to auxiliary rudder  Only few manufacturers have been successful with systems that operate an auxiliary rudder directly from the windvane (Non-servo systems: Windpilot Atlantik, Hydrovane); the picture of the windvane shown uses this principle with the large fabric vane on a vertical axis (the use of wind vanes with a nearly horizontal axis is used predominantly).  Servo pendulum rudder  The most widespread form of self-steering, the servo pendulum, was introduced to cope with the power required to operate a larger rudder and was a successor to the servo trim tab principle (introduced by Herbert \\"Blondie\\" Hasler). Common to all servo pendulum rudder (oar, blade) systems is the fact, that the speed of the boat through the water is used to amplify the small force coming from the wind vane in order to be able to turn the rudder. The servo blade can be turned in its vertical axis and is hung like a pendulum. When it is turned around its vertical axis, the water flow initiates a sideways force on the blade area, and the forceful swing movement to the side is used to act on a rudder (ship's rudder or auxiliary rudder being integrated in the system). A narrow upright board, the wind vane, is mounted on a nearly horizontal axis carrier that is itself rotated around its vertical axis so that with the boat traveling in the desired direction the vane is vertical and edge-on to the wind. The wind vane is balanced by a small weight below the pivot, but if the boat turns so that the board is no longer edge-on to the wind it will be blown over to one side as the extra surface area is revealed. This movement is transmitted by a series of linkages to a blade (or oar) in the water, so that the oar is turned around its vertical axis, when the wind vane rotates from its neutral position. As the blade described above turns, the pressure of water moving past it causes it to swing out sideways on the end of a pivoted rod. An immersed area of 0.1 m2 at 1 m lever length at a boat speed of 2.5 m/s (about 5 knots) and 5¬∞ angle of attack already generates a moment of 180 N‚ãÖm, when the oar has a NACA0012 profile.Servo oar force http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/1_basics/servokraft.html The steering force of the servo oar is transmitted to the main rudder typically involving an arrangement of two lines and four or more rolls to guide the steering ropes to the helm or the steering wheel. Modern servo pendulum self-steering devices with optimized transmission and low friction mechanics are more and more used for day sailing and cruising; formerly being used mainly for long distance ocean passages. The increased low wind capabilities of optimized, modern devices enable downwind steering down to 1.3 m/s apparent wind and 1.5 kn of boat speedLow wind limit http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/2_innov/lowwind.htmlLow Wind Limit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBXzafY49GA ‚Äì properties that make an electronic steering device nearly redundant and enable crossing the doldrums under wind vane self-steering. An increasing number of long distance regatta sailors are using wind vane self-steering because of the fact, that the sails are always kept in optimal angle towards the wind, and hence the speed of the boat is kept at the possible maximum. The mathematical description of the horizontal windvane servo self-steering covers the relation of a course error to a steady-state rudder angle to correct for the course error. The dynamics are described by force and momentum coupling equations.Wind vane momentum: http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/1_basics/windsensor.htmlMomentum of the Servo oar http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/1_basics/servokraft.html Mainly three different mechanical transmission principles are in use: Murray slide-block joint, 90¬∞ bevel gear, Z-shaft, which due to their geometry have different steering force changes by course error change.Transmission: course error produces rudder angle http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/1_basics/transmission.html  Servo pendulum with auxiliary rudder  In cases, when a pure servo pendulum self-steering gear is not usable (Hydraulic rudder gear, very big force needed to turn the rudder), auxiliary rudder systems are used. They consist of a servo pendulum rudder coupled directly to an auxiliary rudder which is part of the self- steering system. The main rudder in such case is used to \\"trim\\" the main course and the self-steering gear steers \\"around\\" that main course according to the changes of the apparent wind.  Sheet to tiller  Aside of the widespread mechanical self-steering through a wind vane being mechanically coupled to the rudder or a servo pendulum rudder, there is a mechanical self steering principle called \\"sheet-to-tiller\\". Rollo Gebhard crossed the Atlantic in his 5.6 m long Solveig using such a method. The sheet-to-tiller self-steering consists of a connection between the spring-loaded tiller and a sheet using the force of the wind in the sail to steer the boat.  Developments  For quite a long time there was little development in the self steering systems that were available commercially. Most new developments came in the form of self-build systems. Crucial roles were played by Walt Murray, an American who published his designs on his website.http://windvaneselfsteering.com/?q=content/walt-murrays-website and Dutchman Jan Alkema who developed a new windvane, the so-called Up Side Down windvane (USD for short, commercially available from only two brands) and a new kind of servo pendulum system that could be fitted to boats with a transom hung rudder. For this last invention Jan Alkema was rewarded the John Hogg- Price from the AYRS ( Amateur Yacht Research Society) in 2005. Jan Alkema published a lot of his inventions on Walt Murray's website. Joern Heinrich added in 2010 a mechanismhttp://www.windgear.eu/_de/2_innov/ydg.html using the roll angle of the boat in downwind situation for a correctional servo oar angle of attack which increases course stability and lowers the risk of broaching in following seas.Verification of YDG mechanism in following swell by measurements https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUO39DB85Y Joern Heinrich also published a mechanismMechanical course-speed regulator for wind vane selfsteering devices on multihull sailboats>http://www.windgear.eu/docs/SpeedSensWSA.pdf which uses a fin in the water to compensate for the apparent wind change during the acceleration/deceleration of multihull yachts with larger speed potential like Catamarans and Trimarans in gusts. Heinrich applies his own parametric simulation software VaneSimParametric wind vane simulation software Vanesim http://www.windautopilot.de/_de/2_innov/sim.html to optimize windvane self- steering devices according to boat properties. In 2002 Robert Chicken patented a sheet to tiller system in the UK, known as The Steersman. It consists of two swinging platforms fitted on to the cockpit coamings either side of the boat,. The normal jib sheet winches are moved from their normal position and then re- bolted down on to the top of these platforms. With the sails set, the leeward jib sheet is cleated to the winch in the normal way, and the wind pressure in the jib, transmitted through the jib sheet, swings the platform forward. To balance this movement, a shock cord spring tensioned between the platform and a point at the stern of the boat, keeps the platform in a central neutral position. Once set, any slight changes in wind strength or direction, causes the platform to swing forwards or backwards. A simple linkage then transmits this movement to the helm to keep the boat on course. The pressure in the sails can vary hugely depending on the wind strength and the direction that the boat is travelling relative to the wind. To accommodate this, the spring is arranged in a ‚Äòblock-and-tackle‚Äô form with a double block fitted to the stern of the boat, and a single block clipped to the platform. The fixed end, and tail end are also attached to the platform; the fixed end is clipped, and the tail end passes through a jamb cleat for fine adjustment. With this in place, the maximum spring tension is now made up of four lengths of shock cord. For a lower wind pressure in the jib, the fixed end, and the single block can be re-clipped to an attachment point on the base of the platform. This then gives a range of spring strengths from one to four shock cord lengths. For very light wind pressures, a single lighter length of shock cord is used instead. The claimed benefit of this design over a windvane system that it \\"is far more sensitive because it uses the larger jib area to sense any changes in the wind\\" is questionable. When the jib is in laminar flow, i.e. optimally trimmed and delivers maximum propulsion, the force at the sheet is biggest and decreases to both sides of course deviation from this optimum. Concluding from that, the ship must be sailed with sub-optimal sail trim in order to have the proper steering correction at the tiller. Its position in the cockpit area however leaves the stern of the boat clear for other purposes such as dinghy davits, stern ladders etc. In 2012, the invention won the Haven Academy Award in the UK. The chairman of the judging committee was Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to complete a circumnavigation non-stop, single handed.

Written by Adam Ant and Marco Pirroni, and featuring on the album of the same name, it was Adam and the Ants' second number-one single in a row and was the fifth biggest hit of the year 1981. Music video Band member and producer Merrick (Chris Hughes), normally on drums, played a stirring riff on an open-tuned acoustic guitar throughout the song. Lead guitarist Pirroni mimed to this part on both an orchestral harp and a miniature harp in the promotional video. The music video was notable for its extravagant production compared to the videos being produced at the time. It featured Adam Ant in a male Cinderella role, complete with moustached drag queen evil step-sisters. The sisters accept an invitation to \\"Come to the ball, and dance the Prince Charming\\", leaving Adam home doing the chores. Sitting at a table in an old-style kitchen, Adam is surrounded by his band members, who are encouraging him: \\"Don't you ever/Don't you ever/Stop being dandy, showing me you're handsome.\\" His Fairy Godmother, portrayed by Diana Dors, suddenly appears with five shirtless men dancing the \\"Prince Charming\\". With a wave of her magic wand, she transforms Adam's attire into flamboyant Regency clothes. Adam makes a grand entrance onto the balcony at the ball, and swings down on a chandelier. He, the Ants, his Fairy Godmother, her male attendant and the invited guests of the ball dance the \\"Prince Charming\\", which became a much imitated arm-crossing dance as the song rose up the charts. Choreographer Stephanie Coleman explained that each hand movement in the Prince Charming dance had a meaning (in order: Pride, Courage, Humour, Flair) each representing an element of Adam Ant's personality. The video ends with Adam smashing a mirror, then singing the \\"Prince Charming, Prince Charming/Ridicule is nothing to be scared of\\" refrain as different characters: the Man with No Name (Clint Eastwood from the Dollars Trilogy), Alice Cooper, Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan (Rudolph Valentino from the silent film The Sheik), and Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone from The Godfather (replaced in an alternative edit of the video by Ant's own \\"Dandy highwayman\\" from the \\"Stand and Deliver\\" video.) The music video was one of Diana Dors' last on-screen performances. Lyrics According to Adam, Prince Charming is based on Beau Brummell. Pirroni described the song as \\"A cleverer song than any of you realise.\\" He also said that the dance routine was initially developed when he realised that the beat of the song made it difficult to dance to in a conventional way, meaning it was unlikely to be played in discos and clubs. \\"War Canoe\\" On 27 March 2010, Rolf Harris claimed on BBC Radio 5 Live's Danny Baker Show that an out-of-court settlement had been reached, with a large sum of royalties received, after a musicologist found \\"Prince Charming\\" to be musically identical to Harris's 1965 song \\"War Canoe\\".

History  Bushire was used as a base by the British Royal Navy in the late 18th century. In the 19th century, Bushehr became an important commercial port. It was occupied by British forces in 1856, during the Anglo-Persian War of 1856‚Äì1857. Bushehr surrendered to the British on 9 December 1856. It was occupied again by the British in 1915, the second time due to German intrigue, most notably by Wilhelm Wassmuss and Rais Ali Delvari.  Postage stamps  Bushire has long been of interest to stamp collectors, since, during their 1915 occupation, the British issued postage stamps. The occupation lasted from 8 August to 16 October, when it was terminated by agreement with the Persian government. The first stamps issued were overprints on Persian stamps of 1911 reading BUSHIRE / Under British / Occupation., issued on 15 August. The same overprint was applied in September, to the series of Persian stamps issued in 1915.

The cathedral is that of St. Parakevi in Therapia (Tarabya). The metropolitan is a member of the Patriarchal Synod. The present Metropolitan is Apostolos Daniilidis. History The village of Derkos/Derkoi (modern Durusu or Terkos) is attested since Classical Antiquity, but Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518) raised it to the status of a city and rebuilt it as a forward stronghold for the defence of Constantinople. Probably at the same time it was created as an episcopal see (\\"Bishopric of Derkoi and Chele\\", ŒïœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒÆ ŒîŒ≠œÅŒ∫œâŒΩ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒßŒ∑ŒªŒÆœÇ). In the first half of the 6th century, the town and the see were known as a stronghold of the Monophysites. The Monophysite ascetic Zoora took refuge there after the Council of Constantinople (536)., p. 176. The see was a suffragan of the metropolis of Heraclea until the 10th century, when it became an autocephalous archbishopric. Bishop Gregory I took part in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787; Macarius I participated in the council of 879, Archbishop Constantine participated in the anti-Jacobite council of 1030, and an unnamed archbishop took part in the Council of Blachernae against John Italos in 1082. In 1166, Archbishop John II tried repeatedly, but without success, to have his see moved to nearby Philea. An archbishop Michael is attested in a latter of 1177 to the Catholicos of Armenian Cilicia Gregory IV the Young, and an archbishop Gregory in a synod in February 1197. In the period of Latin rule in 1204‚Äì47, a Catholic bishop was installed over the see (Derkensem), which was subordinated directly to the Latin Patriarch of Constantinople. The anonymous archbishop of Derkoi co-signed the Acts of Union with the Catholic Church in July 1274. In 1285, Archbishop Constantine co-signed the tomos against the deposed Patriarch of Constantinople John Bekkos. Archbishop Macarius presided over the see in ca. 1289‚Äì94, but it seems to have fallen vacant in the early 14th century: during the patriarchate of Nephon I (1310‚Äì14), the proceeds of the see were transferred directly to the patriarchal see and, in April 1316, Metropolitan Theodoulos of Nymphaion was appointed acting administrator (proedros). The see was restored by March 1324, when Archbishop Loukas is attested, serving at least until 1329. In the same year (1324), the see's annual contributions to the patriarchate were fixed at 24 hyperpyra. Archbishop Gabriel is attested as a signatory of the tomos of 1351, endorsing the views of Gregory Palamas and ending the Hesychast controversy. In 1355, the see was briefly united with the Metropolis of Bizye, under Neophytus. Following the conquest of Heraclea Pontica by the Ottoman Turks in 1360, in January 1365 the Archbishopric of Derkoi was assigned to the Metropolitan of Heraclea to support him through its proceeds. This lasted until ca. March 1371, when the archbishop is again attested as a separate entity. By September 1379, Derkoi was itself raised to a metropolitan see, with the first metropolitan being Paul, who remained in office at least until May 1384. From February 1389 to October 1400, the see was under Metropolitan Joseph. An anonymous incumbent is attested in 1403, but after that the see probably remained vacant due to the Ottoman devastation of the area until about August 1409, when a new incumbent (Basil) is attested. The last metropolitan before the Fall of Constantinople was Acacius, mentioned in late 1452, shortly before the town itself was captured by the Ottomans. Under Ottoman rule it was a little village south-west of Karaburun, a promontory on the Black Sea, and on the southern bank of Lake Derkos, the waters of which are brought to Constantinople by an aqueduct. There were about 300 inhabitants. In 1466, it was ruled directly by the Patriarch of Constantinople [Kambouroglou, Monuments for History of Athens (Gr.), II, 354]. It was not re-established until the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the titular resided at Therapia on the Bosporus. In October 1746, it was raised to the eighth rank of the Greek hierarchy (Mansi, Col. concil., XXXVIII, 527). The diocese included 41 villages in the vicinity of Constantinople and along the shores of the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, among them San Stefano, Makrik√∂y and B√ºy√ºkdere, with Catholic parishes conducted by Capuchins, Dominicans and Minor Conventuals. In 1821, during the massacre that broke out in Constantinople, as a retaliation of the Greek War of Independence, the metropolitan bishop of Derkoi, Gregory, was among the Greek Orthodox upper clergy that was executed by the Ottoman authorities. During the anti-Greek Istanbul pogrom, in September 1955, six churches under the jurisdiction of the metropolis of Derkoi were destroyed, while the remaining two church buildings were saved. Moreover, the metropolitan mansion was burnt to the ground by the fanatical mob. Latter, the site that once hosted the metropolitan mansion was appropriated by the Turkish authorities and, in 1958, a hotel was built.

Erik Magnus was Chamberlain to Queen Sophia Magdalena. In 1783, he was appointed charg√© d'affaires to the Court of France, and in 1785 he was named Ambassador. On 21 January 1786, he married the daughter of the French Minister of Finance, Jacques Necker, mademoiselle Anne Louise Germaine Necker, who was to achieve fame as \\"Madame de Sta√´l\\".  Early life  Erik Magnus Sta√´l von Holstein in 1796 by Ulrika Pasch Erik Magnus was born on 25 October 1749 as the seventh child of Mathias Gustav Sta√´l von Holstein, the scion of an ancient noble family originally from the Rhineland. As a young officer, Sta√´l participated in the 1772 coup that brought Gustav III to power. For his services, he was made a knight of the Order of the Sword and chamberlain to the Queen. He was later assigned to the Swedish embassy to France, serving under the ambassador, Gustaf Philip Creutz. Sta√´l's charming manners, good looks and affable disposition soon impressed Creutz and many members of the French court, including Queen Marie Antoinette herself.  Life and marriage  Madame De Sta√´l in 1812 by Vladimir Borovikovsky After five years of negotiation between Sta√´l, the King of Sweden, Marie Antoinette, and Jacques Necker, Sta√´l agreed to marry Germaine. He obtained a dowry of 650,000 livres, was made permanent Swedish ambassador to the Court of Louis XVI, and was invested with the Order of the Polar Star. The marriage solved Sta√´l‚Äôs financial problems (he was a prolific gambler) but was largely loveless, although not acrimonious. Baron and Madame de Sta√´l pursued other love interests, and were often at odds over politics, but remained friendly to each other. Sta√´l remained ambassador to France through the early convulsions of the French Revolution. Sta√´l had a stormy relationship with Gustav III and he often found himself caught between the interests of his politically active and liberal wife, the ever-changing government of Republican France, and the counter-revolutionary position of the King of Sweden. Sta√´l was dismissed as ambassador to France in 1795 by the young Gustav IV Adolf. For the remainder of his life, Sta√´l ran up enormous debts due to his gambling and relied financially on the Neckers. In early 1802, Sta√´l fell ill. His wife invited him back to the Necker family retreat at Coppet in the hopes that he would recover. In the late spring of 1802, Sta√´l suffered a stroke on his way to Switzerland. Madame de Sta√´l faithfully looked after him until he passed away, on the night of 8 May 1802. Though they were never really close, his death greatly affected his wife and she had him buried at Coppet. Sta√´l was described by his wife and his contemporaries as a handsome man of polished manners, possessed of great wit and charm, kind-hearted, generous, and cultured with a great knowledge of history, fine wines and politics. He was a consummate and talented diplomat, who so greatly impressed the future-First Lady of the United States, Abigail Adams, who accompanied her husband John Adams, then US minister plenipotentiary to France, that she described him in letters home as: \\"The Baron de Sta√´l, the Swedish ambassador, comes nearest to that character, in his manners and personal appearance, of any gentleman I ever saw. The first time I saw him I was prejudiced in his favor, for his countenance commands your good opinion; it is animated, intelligent, sensible, affable and, without being perfectly beautiful, is perfectly agreeable; add to this a fine figure and who can fail in being charmed with the Baron de Sta√´l?\\" However, he could also be weak-willed and lacking in self-control. Sta√´l successfully negotiated the cession of Saint Barth√©lemy to Sweden and supported the proposal of William Bolts for a Swedish colony in the eastern Indian Ocean.Robert J. King, ‚ÄúGustaf III‚Äôs Australian Colony‚Äù, The Great Circle (Journal of the Australian Association for Maritime History) vol.27, no.2, 2005, pp.3-20. He skillfully navigated the troubled waters of the first years of the French Revolution. In his time, he was acknowledged as a diplomat of great talent, but ultimately he was destined to be overshadowed by the brilliance of his wife.

At sixteen she won a national singing competition. She later attended the National Conservatory of Sofia, where she studied voice with Professor Georgi Zlatev-Tcherkin and soprano Katia Spiridonowa and graduated with diplomas in voice and piano, making her stage debut, for her master class finals, as Tatiana in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. Upon graduation, she joined the Opera Studio of the Leipzig Opera, where, in 1967, she made her professional debut as Abigaille in Verdi's Nabucco. While with this company she built up her repertoire with the leading roles in Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Manon Lescaut; Verdi's La traviata, Il trovatore, and Otello; Mozart's Don Giovanni; Strauss's Arabella; and Werner Egk's Die Zaubergeige. For many of these roles she studied with the company's music director, Professor Paul Schmitz, who had studied with Richard Strauss. In 1972, she was invited to join the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, where she was named Kammers√§ngerin during her very first year. In Berlin she continued to expand her repertoire with leading roles in Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro and Cos√¨ fan tutte, Verdi's Aida, Puccini's Tosca, Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, Wagner's Tannh√§user and Lohengrin, and Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos and Der Rosenkavalier.

Located in the south of County Kilkenny, south of the city of Kilkenny and roughly halfway to Waterford city. The sport of hurling is popular in the area, and the local Gaelic Athletic Association team of Ballyhale Shamrocks are the most successful hurling club in All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship history. Local Kilkenny GAA hurler Henry Shefflin holds the record for the highest number of All Ireland Senior Hurling medals for a single player. The location is also close to the Mount Juliet golf course in nearby Thomastown. The food brand Glanbia, originally Avonmore, had its roots in a number of member-owned creameries, before becoming a global showcase coop brand for Irish agriculture. Ballyhale is also home to Kiltorcan's Old Quarry. Ballyhale also played a historic role when, in 1832, approximately 200,000 people from four counties gathered in support of those on trial for the 1831 Battle of Carrickshock. The parish of Ballyhale is made up of three areas; Knockmoylan and the villages of Ballyhale and Knocktopher. The population of the Ballyhale district is 335.  Toponymy  The anglicised Ballyhale comes from the , states that the name is derived from the Walshes among whom Hale or Howl is known to have been a Christian name. However, John Howell is recorded in the barony in 1411, and \\"Edmund Howling of Ballyheale\\" forfeited the townland of Ballyhale in 1653 and was transplanted to Connaught. Historically the name have been spelt in a variety of ways including; Howelleston, Ballyhaele, Ballihowell, and Baile Haeil. In 1802 Tighe recorded ballyhale as a small village with \\"little more than twelve houses\\", permission of a fair, and a ruin of Roman Catholic chapel. By 1851 the town is recorded as Ballyhale town. By 1985 the post office address was Ballyhale, or Baile H√©il. The village gives its name to the wider townland of Ballyhale, and to the Ballyhale electoral district which is one of 113 in the county. History=Avonmore Cooperative Federation 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of County Kilkenny Village Creameries amalgamating to create the Avonmore Creameries agricultural brand that eventually emerged from the Federation formed in 1966. The Coop entity went on to become Avonmore Food plc in 1988 and to later join with Waterford Food plc in 1997. It is today known as the global Food giant, Glanbia, one of the world‚Äôs top nutrition companies with revenues of over ‚Ç¨3.5 billion and 5,815 employees. Ballyhale Creamery was founded in 1895, the year after the founding of The Irish Agricultural Organisation Society (IAOS /ICOS today) that began the cooperative movement in earnest in Ireland. In 1995, Ballyhale celebrated the 100th anniversary of their Creamery's founding with a booklet of its history to mark the occasion. The Ballyhale C.D.S. booklet records that a federation of 25 Co-op Creameries originally emerged in January 1965 under the umbrella of Avonmore Creameries Ltd., with their chairman, John Joe Kearns, acting as their representative on the Avonmore Council; where shares were taken in the new entity by the society and that in following years a Ballyragget milk processing factory was built. The first bulk milk collections tool place from 1973, when the amalgamation was formalised. Ballyhale became one of 20 members of Avonmore Farmers Ltd.; the other founding members being Castlehale, Mullinavat, Iverk, Piltown, Carrigeen, Kilmacow, Ballyragget, South Tipperary, Monastarevan, Muckalee, Barrowvale, Kells, Windgap, Brandonvale, Bennetsbridge, Castlecomer, Freshford, Donaghmore and Fennor. In 1966 Ballyhale Co-Operative Creamery Dairy Society Ltd., formed by local farmers, had joined with other small rural co-operative societies from Kilkenny and some neighbouring counties and, together with Unigate Limited support, formed the Avonmore Creameries Federation Realising the benefits of increased scale and greater diversification in the 1960s, they saw the need for an amalgamation of many small, locally focused co-operatives across Ireland. It led to the construction of a new multi-purpose Avonmore dairy plant facility in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, and a Plant they claimed was the biggest food processing facility in Europe at that time. Today that giant global entity is known as Glanbia. Glanbia has its origins in the Irish agricultural co-operative movement that evolved over the last century since first Irish Co-operative in 1889, founded by Horace Plunkett. Ireland entered the Common Market in 1970. According to Ballyhale CDS anniversary booklet of 1995, the Coop movement in Ireland, which had begun with one society of 50 members in 1889, had grown rapidly to 67 societies with 3,800 members by 1895 and in 1896 Ballyhale C.D.S. became one of its first 110 societies with 10,000 members. The ICOS organisation now has member co-ops and associated companies with 150,000 individual members, and 12,000 employees in Ireland, a further 24,000 abroad, and combined turnover of ‚Ç¨12 billion. And today Glanbia has operations in 34 countries and is exporting to more than 100 countries worldwide. Glanbia plc was formed in 1997 out of the merger of Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc. Glanbia was ranked by revenue (2010 figures) in the top 100 Cooperatives, No 98 in the world and No 1 in Ireland by the International Co-operative Alliance, the global apex organisation of co- operatives worldwide. According to Glanbia Collections in Kilkenny Archives at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny, the Avonmore Coop brand was created through the merger of over 30 Village Creameries that are now included among their archives, and available for public viewing. Kiltorcan Old Quarry Ballyhale is known locally for its Kiltorcan Old Quarry, a sandstone quarry and a site claimed to be of international importance. It is reputed to be 400 million years old, and known internationally for its discovery of fossil ferns since 1853, some pieces of which are on display in The Natural History Museum (Ireland) in Dublin and Rothe House Museum, Kilkenny. The Quarry was opened commercially in the 1980s. According to by local authorities, in Kilkenny County Council's Plans for Ballyhale, Kiltorcan Old Quarry of sandstone was designated as an \\"area of specific interest\\" in 2002. Battle of Carrickshock In 1832, the importance Gathering of c.200,000 people at Ballyhale for the trial of those charged in aftermath of The Battle of Carrickshock, otherwise known as the Carrickshock incident, is acknowledged by researcher Gary Owens of University of Huron, Ontario, Canada as having a significant influence on its overall outcome for anti-tithe movement, known as the Tithe War ensuring that the event marked the beginning of the end of tithes in Ireland. Those charged were successfully defended by Daniel O'Connell, called the Liberator of the Nation, and who addressed the gathering in Irish. It was the first 'monster meeting' of that time. Such peaceful gatherings were to become the hallmark of the Young Ireland and Repeal Movement that was founded in 1839 and which peaked with Daniel O‚ÄôConnell's oration at Tara, 1843, where c.750,000 gathered. Michael Davitt's Museum records show that the Land League campaigns, co-founded in 1879, followed that path too to ensure that it enabled tenant farmers to be able to own the land on which they worked.

When the series begins, Gunther has already worked as a police officer for 30 years and is an experienced police lieutenant, eventually working for the fictitious Vermont Bureau Of Investigation (VBI). He is a Korean War veteran and a widower. Books The Joe Gunther mystery series includes 31 books. # Open Season (1988) begins with a series of intricate crimes in which innocent people are framed. Gunther is forced, to the consternation of his fellow officers, to open up a three-year- old closed case in which a black man was convicted of the rape and murder of a young white girl. Gradually, evidence mounts that the convicted man is innocent, and unknown forces will stop at nothing to find the real criminal. An online review # Borderlines (1990) begins with Gunther taking a working vacation in Vermont's rural Northeast Kingdom. But the town he's visiting has been divided since a back-to-nature cult group known as The Order bought up half the real estate. A cultists' house is burned and the family inside killed, setting off the townfolk's resentment and leading to more murders. Worse, the police suspect that one of Gunther's oldest friends is one of the killers. # In Scent Of Evil (1991), the murder of a stockbroker is the opening crime in a series of elaborate frame-ups. Gunther again faces a killer who is a clever manipulator, working anonymous mayhem to settle old grudges. # The Skeleton's Knee (1992) opens with the death from natural causes of a hermit with a very suspicious case history. The police discover a skeleton on his property with an artificial knee dating back to the '60s. Gunther goes to Chicago hoping to find the man who implanted the knee and encounters a sordid past involving stolen mob money, double crosses and a ruthless killer. # In Fruits Of the Poisonous Tree (1993) Gunther's lover Gail is raped, and after a painstaking search and a dangerous manhunt, the district attorney and the police think they have found their man. Gunther's instincts, however, tell him that their suspect may be the victim of a frame-up. Going against the tide of popular opinion, he follows his gut and opens the case back up in the middle of the trial. # The Dark Root (1994) # The Ragman's Memory (1995) # Bellows Falls (1996) # The Disposable Man (1997) # Occam's Razor (1999) # The Marble Mask (2000) # Tucker Peak (2001) # The Sniper's Wife (2002) # Gatekeeper (2003) # The Surrogate Thief (2004) # St. Albans Fire (2005) # The Second Mouse (2006) # Chat (2007) # The Catch (2008) # The Price of Malice (2009) # Red Herring (2010) # Tag Man (2011) # Paradise City (2012) # Three Can Keep a Secret (2013) # Proof Positive (2014) # The Company She Kept (2015) # Presumption of Guilt (2016) # Trace (2017) # Bury the Lead (2018) # Bomber's Moon (2019) # The Orphan's Guilt (2020) ReferencesSee also *Fruit of the poisonous tree Fictional American police detectives Characters in American novels Fictional characters from Vermont ","title":"Joe Gunther"},{"id":"6297295","text":"Ch√©zard-Saint-Martin is a former municipality in the district of Val-de-Ruz in the canton of Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland.

Okerson Ann Shumelda Okerson (b. c. 1950) is an internationally distinguished librarian and expert on the place of new digital technologies in libraries. She serves as Senior Advisor on Electronic Strategies for the Center for Research Libraries. She served as Associate University Librarian at Yale University, following 15 years of academic library and library management experience, experience in the commercial sector, and service as founding senior program officer for scholarly communications at the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). She has made major contributions to understanding of serials pricing, electronic journals, licensing of electronic resources, and consortial purchasing of electronic materials. She has been a leader in international projects to build a Middle Eastern digital library and has worked broadly with libraries in the region. In 2011, she was elected Chair of the Professional Committee of the International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), one of the senior leadership positions in that body. Long involved with IFLA, she previously served as a member of the governing board and as chair of the section on Serials and Other Continuing Resources. At Yale, in 1996, she organized the Northeast Research libraries consortium (NERL), a group of 28 large research libraries (and over 80 smaller affiliates) that negotiates licenses for electronic information and engages in other forms of cooperative activity. Okerson serves as one of the active, founding members of the International Coalition of Library Consortia (ICOLC) and has contributed as an advisor to the Soros eIFL project. Okerson has worked over the years on numerous projects and publications. In 1992, she wrote the widely read synopsis chapter of the Andrew W. Mellon study University Libraries and Scholarly Communication. Also at ARL, she created and published five editions of the standard Directory of Electronic Journals, Newsletters and Academic Discussion Lists (1991-1995). She organized and led four electronic networked publishing symposia (organized on behalf of the ARL and the Association of American University Presses), and edited three volumes of proceedings from those symposia. With James O'Donnell of the University of Pennsylvania, she edited Scholarly Journals at the Crossroads: a Subversive Proposal for Electronic Journal Publishing (ARL, June 1995), representing an extensive multi-national Internet discussion across many e-lists about the future of scholarly journals. Her articles on serials pricing (1987) and on copyright (1992) won American Library Association (ALA) awards for Best Article in the area of serials, acquisitions, and/or collections in both 1988 and 1993. The ALA named her Serials Librarian of the year in 1993. In 1999, she was named the winner of ALA's LITA/High Tech award. From 1997‚Äì2001, with funding from the Council on Library and Information Resources, she and the Yale Library staff mounted an online educational resource about library licensing of electronic content in a project called LIBLICENSE. Its extensive annotations and links are complemented by Liblicense-l, an international, moderated online discussion list frequented by nearly 4,000 librarians, publishers, attorneys, students and numerous other interested individuals. In 1998, Okerson secured an additional grant that created the Liblicense software, which enables users to generate a customized license using standard language options. In April 2001, the Digital Library Federation endorsed the project's work on a Model Electronic License for academic research libraries. This model license has since been adapted and used by many libraries, consortia, and publishers. Other recent activities include being a principal investigator on several cutting-edge grants, including two U.S. Department of Education Title VI grants for building components of a Middle East Virtual Library, a National Endowment for the Humanities NEH grant for digitization of Iraqi scholarly journals, and a foundation grant for improving liberal arts teaching through use of library special collections. Okerson has served on external advisory boards for a number of organizations, including both the Library of Alexandria and the Library of Congress.

It lies about 2 miles (3 km) from the Anatolian coast (Lycia), more or less halfway between Rhodes and Antalya. Early history The island was colonised by Dorian Greeks, during the Hellenistic period the island was ruled by Rhodes, being part of its Peraia. In the Byzantine Empire it was part of the province of the Islands, whose capital was Rhodes. In 1306 the island was taken over by the Knights of St. John Hospitaller of Jerusalem, headed by Foulques de Villaret. In 1512 it was conquered by Ottoman Sultan Suleiman I. French occupation On 14 March 1913 the local population imprisoned the Turkish governor and his Ottoman garrison and proclaimed a provisional government.Bertarelli, 132 In August 1913, the Greek government sent from Samos a provisional governor supported by gendarmes. On 28 December 1915, the French navy occupied the island. In 1920, the French occupation forces issued stamps of the French post offices in the Turkish Empire overprinted O.N.F. / Castellorizo, then with B.N.F. / CASTELLORIZO and then O F / CASTELLORISO oriented vertically. All of these overprints are uncommon, with prices ranging from US$10 up to over US$500 for some types. Italian rule In the Treaty of S√®vres the island was assigned to Italy and the Italian navy assumed it from the French on 1 March 1921. The Treaty of Lausanne confirmed the Italian claim on Kastellorizo, and the island ‚Äì under the Italian name \\"Castelrosso\\" ‚Äì was then integrated in the possession of the Isole Italiane dell'Egeo. Starting in 1922, the Italians overprinted their own stamps with CASTELROSSO horizontally. In 1923 they issued a series of five stamps depicting a map of the island and an Italian flag, then went back to more overprints on Italian stamps, with a regular issue in 1924 where the overprint was applied diagonally, the Ferrucci issue in 1930, and the Garibaldi issue of 1932. A few types are readily available unused and cost under US$1, but the others, and all used copies, are in the US$10‚Äì$60 range. Post war When Italy capitulated to the Allies (8 September 1943), the island was occupied by Allied forces. Kastellorizo was assigned to Greece with the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. In 1947 Greek stamps overprinted Œ£.Œî.Œî. were used in the Dodecanese. The island formally joined the Greek State on 7 March 1948 together with the other Dodecanese islands.

While the full form ' is applied even to God and Jesus Christ, the shortened form is used only of human rulers, ecclesiastical or lay. For example, in Annales Loiseliani events concerning Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, Charlemagne and Pope Hadrian I are referred to as ' (king) and ' (apostolic), and as ' and '.Passage from the Royal Frankish Annals, quoted in ' is used in ecclesiastical Latin as a generic title for a superior. For example, where, in the official English translation of the General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM), 175, the deacon who is about to read the Gospel requests the presiding priest's blessing, saying in a low voice: \\"Your blessing, Father\\"; what he says in the Latin text of the General Instruction, 175 is: Iube, domne, benedicere (not domine). A similar usage survives in the honorific Don, in Italian and Spanish, and Dom, in French and Portuguese. Umberto Benigni wrote, in Catholic Encyclopedia, that \\"perhaps the only example\\" of the use of domnus apostolicus by Greek authors is the second letter from Theodore the Studite to Leo III, '.  Apostolicus  The pope is described by the nominalized adjective ' (apostolic), because he occupies an apostolic see. Since the Holy See (or Roman See) is the apostolic see in Western Christianity, ' meant simply the Roman See, and ' the bishop of Rome. Claude of Turin \\"gives a curious explanation\\" as meaning ', ‚Äì a custodian of the apostle. A list of popes compiled during the papacy of Pope Vigilius () begins: ' (\\"Here begin the names of the Apostolics\\"). The title of ' is also used in the acts of the Second Anglo-Saxon Council of Cloveshoo, in 747, for Pope Zachary and recurs frequently in documents of the Carolingian kings. There are also the expression ' (\\"apostolicate\\" = pontificate) and the ablative absolute ' (\\"during the apostolicate/pontificate of\\"). In Gaul the term ' (apostolic see) was used, as early as the 5th century, to describe any episcopal see, even if not founded by an apostle. By the 6th century, the term was in general use, and letters addressed by the Merovingian royalty to Gallic bishops collectively begin with ' (\\"To the holy lords most worthy of their apostolic seat\\") and the title ' continued to be applied to individual bishops in the time of Charlemagne, as in a letter of introduction that he gave to the papal legate Boniface. Benigni explains this usage is based on the bishops being successors of the apostles. And although, in the 9th century the title became reserved to popes even in the Frankish empire, there are traces of its former use even in the 11th century: the Council of Rheims (1049) excommunicated Cresconius, bishop of Iria Flavia, ' (because he wrongly claimed the prestige of an apostolic name for himself), thinking of himself as the successor of Saint James the Greater, and the council declared ' (that only the Roman pontiff was primate of the universal Church and apostolicus).

Non-'Germania' 5 pfennig stamp. Postmark from Heligoland, dated 1901-07-18. 5 pfennig 'Germania stamp'. During the period when Heligoland (a German island in the North Sea) was a British possession, about 20 postage stamps were issued between 1867 and 1890. There were up to eight printings of a single denomination and also a large volume of reprints which are known as the Berlin, Leipzig and Hamburg Reprints, respectively. The Berlin reprints are sometimes better quality than the originals. The reprints were done between 1875 and 1895. Consequently, many \\"old\\" collections contain reprints rather than originals. Some believe there were seven million reprints as compared to the known 1¬Ω million originals, of which perhaps half were sold through the post office and the remainder sold to dealers when withdrawn from use. A few printings were never postally sold but nevertheless found their way into the hands of dealers. The stamps were printed by the Prussian State Printing Office in Berlin. They were denominated in the Hamburg Schilling until 1875, when both German Reich and British values appeared on each stamp issue (the Farthing/Pfennig issues). All are embossed with a silhouette of Queen Victoria excepting the four highest values which represent Heligoland escutcheons. Mint stamps of Heligoland are moderate to medium priced but with some running to 1000 euros (2005) rarities. Some used stamps have brought 4800 euros at auction and some covers have brought 10 or 12 thousand euros. This is an inducement for forgery. Because used stamps are often more valuable than mint stamps, forged postal cancellations are plentiful and are the rule on purported high-value items. Because of the many forged cancellations and many reprints collectors of Heligoland stamps are advised either to become expert or to rely on specialists; most reputable dealers will not handle them because of the prevalence of reprints and forgeries. The collector who wishes to become expert is advised to acquaint himself with the Michel Deutschland Spezial Katalog and acquire, at least, Helmuth Lemberger's \\"Helgoland Philatelie\\". Most of the philatelic literature is in German. The Heligoland post office used German-style adhesive paper seals to close official post office envelopes. At least two examples of a pale blue version are known to exist, together with one red.

The International Order of Saint Stanislaus is a Polish fraternal order founded on 16 May 2004. Although claiming to follow the \\"code of chivalry\\" it acknowledges itself as a recently founded private organisation without fount of honour and no legitimate order of chivalry. In doing so, the organisation frankly acknowledges the problems with its background organisation, Ordo Sancti Stanislai founded by Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki in 1979 as an attempted revival of the Polish Order of Saint Stanislaus, in turn founded in 1765. The International Order of Saint Stanislaus is generally regarded as a fraternal order. It has been compared to the masonic movement. History=Background In 1979, Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki and a Polish exile group claiming to be the legitimate government founded the Ordo Sancti Stanislai, attempting to revive the Polish Order of Saint Stanislaus, founded in 1765 as an order of knighthood of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, since it had been incorporated by the Russian Empire in 1831 as the Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov). However, the management of the new organisation resulted in several claimed successor movements. During the 1990s, disputes with Juliusz Nowina-Sokolnicki caused several national sub- groups of this organisation, called priories, to break away. Foundation In 2004, several of the existing national priories of the Ordo Sancti Stanislai joined together to create the International Order of Saint Stanislaus as an alliance of national groups.

'Telopea Park School (') is a government international primary and secondary school in Canberra, Australia. It is named after the adjacent Telopea Park. It was founded in 1923, making it the oldest school in Canberra. Telopea Park School is one of the few public schools in the Australian Capital Territory to teach students from Kindergarten to Year 10 and is the only bi-national school in Canberra. Recognised in a treaty, it is fully accredited by the French Ministry of Education and offers a bilingual program from Kindergarten to Year 10. It is also one of two high schools in the ACT to be part of the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Programme, having gained IB membership in 2006. The school buildings have been heritage- listed by the ACT Heritage Council.  Primary school One half of the school's buildings has been allocated to the primary section of Telopea Park School. All of the students in primary at Telopea Park School follow a bilingual education, with 80% of the lessons from Kindergarten to Year 2 given in French by teachers recognised by both the French Education department and the ACT Department of Education. In Years 3 to 6, French and English is taught as a 50/50 ratio. French staff are generally contracted for 2 to 3 years. They arrive and depart mid-year in accordance with Northern Hemisphere schooling. Students also have classes given in English by Australian staff to complement their French language education.  Secondary school  The secondary school is not exclusively English speaking. The English/French Stream (EFS) allows students to continue their education in French. It follows the French education system while incorporating three compulsory ACT courses. The other students, who form about two-thirds of the student body, follow the ACT secondary school system and can then complete the International Baccalaureate Organisation Middle Years Program. Most students from Telopea Park School go on to Narrabundah College, the EFS in particular as Narrabundah College is the only college in Canberra (and one of only two schools in Australia) to allow students to sit the French Baccalaur√©at.  Languages  During Years 7 to 10, learning a language other than English is compulsory at Telopea park school, unlike most other ACT secondary schools. Students usually study a single language for all four years. However, sometimes beginner classes are started for new students to the school in years 9 and 10. Students choose between Spanish, Italian, German, Japanese, Indonesian, and French. As of 2017 Mandarin was introduced to the school, making a total of 7 languages. Students follow three hours of language classes a week.http://www.telopea.act.edu.au/about_our_school/bi-lingual The English/French Stream  The English/French Stream (EFS) is essentially a portion of students at Telopea High School who follow a different system and curriculum to those of the English Stream (who follow the standard ACT system and curriculum). These students are usually those who follow on from Telopea Park Primary School. The way the EFS students learn is very different from that of the students of the English Stream: EFS students have fewer elective classes, as they have compulsory History and Geography every term, and they learn three languages instead of two (English, French, and a third language).

The Bulgarian fight for freedom was interpreted as a sacred act of heroes exactly because it did not have any perceivable chance of success. Despite the lack of demographic, military and other such possibilities of success against the Ottoman Empire which was still militarily resilient, the Bulgarians toiled under dire circumstances against it. The failure itself turned into a moral success and granted the Bulgarians the right to be free. \\"Epic of the Forgotten\\" is a cycle of 12 odes arranged in accordance with the moment of creation, written by Ivan Vazov in Plovdiv in the period between 1881-1884. :The cycle includes: * \\"Levski\\" * \\"Benkovski\\" * \\"Kocho (The Defense of Perushtitsa)\\" * \\"Zhekov Brothers\\" * \\"Kableshkov\\" * \\"Paisii\\" * \\"Miladinov Brothers\\" * \\"Rakovski\\" * \\"The Karadja\\" * \\"1876\\" * \\"Volov\\" * \\"The Resistance of Shipka\\" Sources * Ivan Vazov.

Ahlquist is the founder and editor-in-chief of Uprise RI, a Rhode Island based news site covering issues of social justice, human rights, progressive politics and climate change. He is also the President and founding member of Humanists of Rhode Island. He is known for his reporting on Uprise RI, which has been credited with informing and sustaining the movement against a proposed fracked-gas power plant in Burrillville, Rhode Island.  Personal life  Ahlquist is the former owner of retail comics and video store Atomic Comics & Video. He is the uncle of Jessica Ahlquist, an activist and public speaker who filed a lawsuit in 2012 against Cranston High School West, where she was a student, to remove a religious prayer from its auditorium.  Journalism career  Jerry Elmer, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation, credits Ahlquist and his reporting on Uprise RI with informing and sustaining the movement against a proposed fracked-gas power plant in Burrillville, Rhode Island. Previously he wrote for RI Future, but left around October 2017. Shortly after, on November 1, 2017, he founded Uprise RI.  Burillville Power Plant movement  Through his coverage on Uprise RI, Ahlquist has been credited with informing and sustaining the movement against a fracked-gas power plant in Burrillville, Rhode Island, which was proposed by chicago-based energy developer Invenergy. In November 2017, Ahlquist was denied press access to an event related to the proposed power plant. A public relations officer representing the event, hosted by the New England Coalition for Affordable Energy and Rhode Islanders for Affordable Energy, wrote in an email that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre inviting only non- partisan/non-activist outlets like the ProJo, NPR, etc.\\". Providence Journal Reporter Alex Kuffner later gave Ahlquist a recording of the entire event. In 2019 Ahlquist was selected as a speaker at the TEDxProvidence conference, where he discussed his ongoing coverage of the proposed fracked-gas power plant in Burrillville, Rhode Island.  Rhode Island Open Meetings Act controversies  In at least two notable instances, Ahlquist has been confronted by representatives of Rhode Island state or local government and asked to cease recording of public meetings. Rhode Island's Open Meetings Act authorizes individuals to record public meetings. In these two instances, Steven Brown, the Executive Director of the Rhode Island American Civil Liberties Union, has defended Ahlquist and reminded representatives of their obligations under the Open Meetings Act. In 2017, at a Cranston City Council meeting, council President Michael Farina told the chamber audience that recording devices were prohibited. Ahlquist protested, saying ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs actually not legal.‚Äù Farina responded, citing municipal rule ‚Äú34b.‚Äù Ahlquist continued objecting, and Farina said he would make a one-time exception. Brown wrote a letter to Councilor Farina stating, \\"We have reviewed the City Council's rules and have been unable to find any rule, including Rule 34(b), that contains the ban you cited.\\" Brown then stated that if a rule 34b existed it would be unlawful and cited precedents Belcher v. Mansi, Lemus v. Providence Board Zoning Board of Review, and Staven v. Portsmouth Financial Subcommittee.http://www.rifuture.org/wp-content/uploads/Letter-to-Cranston- City-Council-re-recording-meetings-012617.pdf In 2018, Wayne Kezirian, then chairman of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, sent Chief Security Officer James Pereira to the back of the room to instruct Ahlquist to cease recording.

Recognition Humanists of Rhode Island honored Ahlquist with their Rhode Island Humanist of the Year award in 2014. The award was established in 2013 to recognize a Rhode Island area resident who has made a significant contribution to the advancement of humanist values in the state through the force of ideas and action. He was the recipient of Rhode Island Pride's 2015 Spirit of Pride Award for his coverage of same-sex marriage in Rhode Island, hate crimes committed against members of the LGBT community, HIV stigmatization, and other social justice issues on RI Future. Rhode Island Pride Chairman Kurt Bagley described Ahlquist as someone who ‚Äúgives activists and protestors a voice, a microphone and a camera.‚Äù In 2018 he was presented with the DARE award, for his coverage of DARE actions, and of Rhode Island activists generally, on Uprise RI.

Through Sullivan, Briggs was introduced to members of The Echoes, a band that Briggs ultimately joined for three weeks in 1961, as his first engagement as a professional musician, before returning to school. During this brief period, Briggs met Rory Storm, Ringo Starr and Gerry and the Pacemakers, among other musicians, and played with The Echoes at the Cavern Club in Liverpool. Briggs continued playing with semi-professional bands upon his return to school, and also was asked to rejoin The Echoes in 1962 for an engagement as the backing band for Jerry Lee Lewis. In the summer of 1962, Briggs was playing with a band called Peter Nelson and The Travelers, members of whom would later form The Flower Pot Men and White Plains, and which briefly included Mitch Mitchell as the drummer. Briggs' experiences as a musician conflicted with his studies and Briggs was asked not to return to Hampton Grammar School as of the commencement of the 1962-1963 academic year. During the 1962-1963 period, Briggs played throughout England, Scotland and Germany as a member of the Shel Carson Combo, which later became The Rokes upon the band's relocation to Italy, which Briggs did not participate in.

Between 1967 and 1968, Briggs recorded three albums with Eric Burdon and The Animals,Winds of Change (1967), The Twain Shall Meet (1968) and Every One of Us (1968). two of which involved song co-writing credit for all members of the band. As a consequence, Briggs is credited as a co-writer of most of the hit singles of the band during this period, as well as being formally credited as the arranger of most of the singles. Briggs, who could read music, was able to develop music charts and consequently arranged much of the band's music during this period, adding horn and other instrumental parts to the songs. In January 1967, barely a month after the band commenced performing, manager Mike Jeffrey arranged for Eric Burdon to record a song being included in the soundtrack for the Casino Royale movie, which was being written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Briggs had arranged the music, to the satisfaction of Bacharach and David. It was the first written arrangement by Briggs to have been recorded. Eric Burdon's lack of interest in the project, demonstrated by his lack of preparation in relation to Hal David's lyrics, caused the opportunity to be scrapped, to Briggs' significant regret.Biography of Vic Briggs. Invincible Music, via the Wayback Machine Internet Archive. Later in 1967, \\"Ain't That So\\", co-written by Briggs and John Scott, was included in the soundtrack to the movie Stranger in the House. Briggs considers the appearance of the band at the Monterey Pop Festival, in June 1967, as one of his most significant experiences as a musician. He regards one of his most exciting performances as being when The Animals played at the Hollywood Bowl, in November 1967.This was the second of two concerts sponsored by White Front stores. People who purchased an album issued by either MGM or Warner Bros. received a ticket to the event. In addition to Eric Burdon and The Animals, other performers on the bill were The Who, the Everly Brothers, The Association, Sopwith Camel and The Sunshine Company. The Hollywood Bowl performance was on 18 November 1967. The previous day, the same performers had appeared, under the same arrangement, at the Cow Palace in Daly City.

Briggs, along with bandmate Danny McCulloch, was fired from the band in the summer of 1968, prior to the release of Every One of Us, in August 1968.Despite the successful single \\"White Houses\\", released in November 1968, the album had a limited release in North America and was not released in England. Briggs has not seen Eric Burdon since approximately 1969. In 1992, to the consternation of Eric Burdon, Briggs registered a U.S. trademark of \\"The Animals\\" band name, and performed under that name with former band members Danny McCulloch and Barry Jenkins. The band's most notable performance, with Phil Ryan instead of Eric Burdon on lead vocals, was a 1992 performance in Moscow's Red Square, as part of a benefit concert for victims of the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster. Later career During the 1968-1969 period, Briggs, having purchased a house in Topanga Canyon and based in Los Angeles, developed a reputation as an independent arranger and producer. Since Briggs was himself a professional musician, he was considered by other musicians to have a particular sensitivity, when arranging and producing for them.For example, shortly before his death, in a 2011 interview prior to the reissue of Close, which had been produced and arranged by Briggs, Sean Bonniwell commented as follows: \\"Vic Briggs did a great job producing me. I'd go over to his house in the Canyon, and I'd sing the songs we were gonna record the next day. He'd sit right down and notate that thing, orchestrate it. I said, 'I want French horns here and so forth and so on, and maybe this little theme.' And that guy just, man, he zipped it down. He said, 'Oh yeah, this is gonna sound good, this is gonna sound good.' It was a wonderful experience, a wonderful collaboration. He understood what I was going after perfectly, and allowed me a free hand in the studio as well. If something wasn't quite working, I'd say, 'Let's try this. Let's try something completely different.' Sometimes he'd say, 'Well, this is gonna work,' and I'd say, 'Well, no, it's not going where it should go to get to the end.' So he'd say, 'Okay, where are you going, what do you want to do?'\\" Richie Unterberger, Interview with Sean Bonniwell (2011), contained in Liner Notes for T.S. Bonniwell's Close; richieunterberger.com. Retrieved 2017-05-09. In another 2011 interview, Bonniwell commented further, as follows: \\"Vic was a godsend. He insisted I sing and play the songs live for him, two or three at a time, in the late afternoon, near dusk, at his hillside cottage in the Canyon. Basically, he took it from there. As we progressed, so did our collaboration. However, a number of compositions were prearranged: 'Where Am I To Go' and 'Something To Be' are two examples of songs where the rhythm section was rehearsed with players of my choosing. In fact, Vic left me alone to 'school' the contract players in this way as well, in the studio, while he kept busy setting the sound and mix. When the basic tracks were satisfactory, he added the orchestration. To say we were on the same page is an understatement. It was a wonderful experience. I dare say it transformed both of us.\\" Peter Sjoblom interview with Sean Bonniwell; Bonniwell Music Machine. Retrieved 2017-05-10. Musicians chosen by Bonniwell and contracted by Briggs included Jim Gordon on drums and Lyle Ritz, a member of The Wrecking Crew, on bass. In May 1969, he became a staff producer and arranger at Capitol Records. During this period, he arranged and produced albums by Danny McCulloch, Zoot Money, Hilton Valentine and Sean Bonniwell, among others. None of the albums were successful, which Briggs attributed in part to the lack of support by the record company for new artists. An album was required to succeed on its own, independently of record company support. Bonniwell and his music, including the album produced and arranged by Briggs, later achieved a level of cult status.Editorial Review: T.S. Bonniwell, Close;Amazon.com.

Briggs and several other producers were fired by Capitol Records at the end of 1969, with existing projects on which they were working being discontinued.One such project by Briggs was Green Morning, by Tina and David Meltzer, which was eventually released in 1998. As described by David Meltzer, \\"A mutual friend, Chris Brooks, introduced us to Vic Briggs who had been the lead guitarist with The Animals. Vic was now producing records for Capitol and liked Poet Song tremendously, but thought he could produce a better album. He asked us to make a demo-tape for him to pitch to his bosses at Capitol. ...Capitol liked what their new British producer played and they gave the green light. We left Vanguard amicably and signed with Capitol. The instrumental tracks were cut at the Capitol Recording Studios in Hollywood.

Cover photos were taken and liner notes were written by poet Kenneth Rexroth, a founding father of the San Francisco Renaissance and Beat movement. In a couple of weeks, we received a tape of the mixed-down album and played it for anybody who stumbled into our home. Then there was an odd silence. Then there was a long-distance call from Vic who broke the news. He and four or five other producers who Capitol management had hired had been let go. Why? A corporate turn-over: a new management team was brought in and canceled all of the previous management's projects. Vic was out of a job.\\" David Meltzer, History of Green Morning; meltzerville.com.

Briggs attributes his firing from Capitol Records, in December 1969, as precipitating his decision to leave the music business, as well as the commencement of his spiritual growth. He sold all of his guitars, a decision which he later came to regret, and did not own a guitar for nineteen years thereafter.Briggs recommenced playing the guitar in 1989, following a backstage meeting with Jerry Garcia, who was playing in San Diego with the Jerry Garcia Band. Garcia remembered Briggs from San Francisco in late 1968, when Briggs had lived and recorded with Garcia and the Grateful Dead for a period, following Briggs' departure from The Animals.

The Ghosh album was of flute (bansuri) music. After listening to the albums borrowed from Eric Clapton, Briggs went to an Indian import store and purchased both records, returning to Clapton the ones Briggs had been lent. Briggs still has the albums in his record collection. Briggs later purchased the 1965 album by Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan, Alla Rakha - Duets. Briggs was particularly influenced by the sarod playing of Khan, whom he describes as \\"one of the most emotionally expressive musicians in the world\\". Briggs later met Ravi Shankar at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, where Briggs was also performing, with Eric Burdon and The Animals. Shankar's performance at the Monterey Pop Festival was the first performance of Indian classical music that Briggs had ever seen. The second performance of Indian classical music that Briggs attended was that of Ali Akbar Khan in London, later that same year. The performances of Khan and Shankar profoundly affected Briggs. Following initial influences through attending a seminar by Baba ram das (the former Richard Alpert), in January 1970 Briggs attended a Los Angeles yoga class instructed by Yogi Bhajan. Followers of Yogi Bhajan included singer Johnny Rivers. Briggs was profoundly influenced by the experience, and followed Yogi Bhajan for twenty years thereafter. In retrospect, Briggs regarded his time with Yogi Bhajan as having been cult-like in nature.Untitled article, Profile of Vic Briggs, Kauai Times, 7 February 1996. As reprinted in antionmusic.oom.

During this period, Briggs developed further interest in Sikh religious music, and in the Sikh religion, spending much time with members of the Sikh community in London. Briggs was particularly attracted to the use of the harmonium in Sikh religious music, and commenced learning how to play it.Briggs also commenced learning to play the sarod, but ceased playing the instrument, based on his view that his family obligations prevented him from being able to make the commitment required to master it. Members of the Sikh community in London began to refer to Briggs as Vikram Singh, and were impressed with Briggs' ability to sing and play Sikh sacred music. In 1971, Briggs was formally baptized as a Sikh and chose the name Vikram, to which was added Singh Khalsa. Briggs was thereafter invited to perform at various Sikh temples throughout England. Also during this period, Briggs met and later married actress Kirsten Lindholm, who also converted to Sikhism. At the request of Yogi Bhajan, Briggs returned to southern California from England, in the early 1970s. Briggs attended the Ali Akbar College of Music in Marin County. In 1977, Yogi Bhajan appointed Briggs and his wife as co-directors of the Guru Ram Das Ashram, in San Diego. They continued in that capacity until 1990, when they left Yogi Bhajan. The involvement in the Sikh community of Briggs and his wife continued to grow; Briggs became one of the founding members of the Sikh temple in San Diego. Briggs and his wife left Yogi Bhajan based on a dispute over whether the equity in the temple should belong to the local membership or to the central leadership. During this period, Briggs also had a plumbing business in San Diego. In 1979, Briggs performed Sikh religious music throughout northern India and was the first non-Indian to perform kirtan at Harimandir Sahib (also called the Golden Temple of Amritsar), which was a very powerful religious moment for him. Briggs subsequently recorded several albums of Indian music. with a particular focus on the Gurbani kirtan, being representations of hymns from Sikh scriptures generally set to ragas. Briggs keeps a degree of distance from Sikh social settings: \\"Sikhi spoke to my soul. Gurbani still speaks to my soul. I just prefer not to be involved much with Sikhs, Indian or American, because of the political considerations that are always present.\\"Gursant Singh, An interview with Vikram Singh Khalsa, former Vic Briggs by Kamalla Rose Kaur; The Gurumukh Yoga Forum, 22 January 2008.

The novel concerned the challenges to a struggling musician in the 1990s.Briggs expressed his opinion of the novel as follows: \\"Very convincing and authentic both in its depiction of the music scene and the drug scene. The chapters involving the drug dealer genuinely disturbed me: though the book is set in the ‚Äò90s, he reminded me of several characters I met back in London in the '60s, the time of the Kray twins and many others like them.

After a year at the Ballot, he moved to Ft. Worth, Texas, where he worked as a reporter for two years on a predecessor to the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram. In 1894 he interrupted his career in journalism to return to Columbia, where he entered law school, from which he graduated in 1897.

Foreign government representation In 2000 Davis lobbied on behalf of Pakistan's government while U.S. President Bill Clinton was in deliberations over whether to visit the country. Those lobbying on behalf of neighboring India, at the time, said such a visit would be legitimizing a terrorist state. In regards to the negotiations Davis stated, \\"Whatever we might say about this particular government in Pakistan, it has immediately indicated a willingness to negotiate. Nobody has yet explained why India refuses to sit down and negotiate, that's why President Clinton's involvement is so important.\\" In July 2009 Davis represented the Honduran Business Council and testified publicly before the House Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on its behalf. He criticized the deportation of former President Manuel Zelaya but also supported a reconciliation solution based on principles of the rule of law and due process.Testimony of Lanny J. Davis , Foreign Affairs, July 10, 2009 In 2010 Davis worked with the State Department's West African Bureau and the U.S. Ambassador to Equatorial Guinea to assist in transitioning to a transparent democracy that protected due process and human rights. These efforts culminated in a speech Davis wrote for the President of Equatorial GuineaSpeech Delivered by President Obiang Nguema Mbasago that was ultimately endorsed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa.Letter from Desmund Tutu For ten days in December 2010, Davis represented the Washington, D.C. Ivory Coast Embassy and Ambassador and worked closely with the State Department's West African Bureau to facilitate a phone call from President Obama to the defeated president of Ivory Coast to try to persuade him to avoid bloodshed and make a peaceful exit from office. When the defeated Ivory Coast president refused to accept the phone call, Davis resigned.Resignation Letter from Lanny Davis On January 1, 2011, the official spokesman of the U.S. State Department, P. J. Crowley, publicly acknowledged that Davis' role was \\"helpful\\". Author and commentator In 1999, Davis wrote a memoir about his work in the White House titled Truth to Tell: Tell It Early, Tell It All, Tell It Yourself: Notes from My White House Education. His most recent book, which appeared in 2006, is titled Scandal: How \\"Gotcha\\" Politics Is Destroying America. The book received praise from politicians and commentators across party lines, including Senators Evan Bayh and Lindsey Graham. Davis has also served as a frequent political commentator on television, radio, and newspapers. In 2006, through opinions expressed in The Wall Street Journal (August 8, 2006) and on Fox News, Davis strongly supported longtime friend Joseph Lieberman in his losing bid against Ned Lamont for the Democratic Party nomination for the post of U.S. Senator from Connecticut. He then continued to support Lieberman when he ran and won the General Election as an Independent. In 2008, Davis supported Senator Hillary Clinton in her race for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States, and has appeared on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC as a surrogate for her. After Clinton conceded, Davis went on to support Barack Obama. In 2008, Davis questioned the United States' response to the conflict between Russia and Georgia and advised present and future U.S. leaders to consider the point of view of the Russian leaders before unilaterally supporting the government of Georgia in the conflict. Currently, Davis appears weekly on three radio programs: America's Morning News Radio Show with John McCaslin, WMAL's Mornings on the Mall, and Andy Parks Live. He was a participant in the D.C.'s Funniest Celebrity competition in 2011.  Opinions and criticism  Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer and columnist for Salon, criticized Davis in 2009 for Davis's perceived failure to disclose his clients. Greenwald asserted his clients included dictatorships and opponents of unions and health care reform.

Anglicans in Botswana are part of the Church of the Province of Central Africa. Membership in the Roman Catholic Church includes about 5% of the nation's population. Recently the number of Pentecostal churches has been rising. A strong revival has been going on and most churches conduct all-night prayer meetings. In these meetings the prayer requests include the leadership of the country and all the ministers in the body of Christ. Some of the churches include Pentecostal Protestant Church, Assemblies of God, Apostolic Faith Mission, Eloyi Christian Church, Pentecostal Holiness Church, Dutch Reformed Church in Botswana, Good News Ministries, Christ Embassy, Bible Life Ministries, Victory International Centre (VIC), First Love Church, to name but a few. There's also the presence of Eastern Orthodox Church. One of the first missionaries to bring the gospel to the land of Botswana was David Livingstone. The churches normally meet occasionally to worship together under the name Evangelic Fellowship of Botswana.  Major denominational families  Botswana citizens identify themselves as Christians. Anglicans, Methodists, and the United Congregational Church of Southern Africa make up the majority of Christians. A survey of the Botswana identified the percentages of these groups as 66% (Protestant), 7% (Roman Catholics) and 1%(Others).  Youth programs  While children and youth in the colonial era were treated as small adults, awareness of their special status and needs grew in the nineteenth century, as one after another the denominations large and small began special programs for their young people. Protestant denominations set up Sunday school programs. They provide a major source of new members. The Catholics have set up an entire network of parochial schools, and by the late nineteenth century probably more than half of their young members are attending elementary schools run by local parishes.  Demographics = Beliefs and attitudes  * 19 percent of Botswana Christians believe salvation comes through Jesus Christ, attend church regularly, are Bible readers, invest in personal faith development through their church, accept leadership positions in their church, and believe they are obligated to \\"share [their] faith\\", that is, to evangelize others. * 20 percent are referred to as Professing Christians. They also are committed to \\"accepting Christ as Savior and Lord\\" as the key to being a Christian, but focus more on personal relationships with God and Jesus than on church, Bible reading or evangelizing. * 24 percent fall into a category named Liturgical Christians. They are predominantly Lutheran and Roman Catholic. They are regular churchgoers, have a high level of spiritual activity and recognize the authority of the church. * 16 percent are considered Private Christians. They own a Bible but don't tend to read it. Only about one-third attend church at all. They believe in God and in doing good things, but not necessarily within a church context. This was the largest and youngest segment. Almost none are church leaders. * 21 percent in the research are called Cultural Christians. These do not view Jesus as essential to salvation. They exhibit little outward religious behavior or attitudes. They favor a universality theology that sees many ways to God. Yet, they clearly consider themselves to be Christians.  Conversion  A study from 2015 estimated that about 100 Botswana Muslims convert to Christianity, most of whom belong to an evangelical or Pentecostal community. It's been also reported that conversion into Christianity is significantly increasing among East Asians in Botswana.  Education  The majority of Botswana Christians attend mixed gender public schools, mostly government schools.

The club's opening night featured free entry, leading to a capacity crowd. Under a strict policy of \\"no live bands,\\" the club went on to run with weekly capacity crowds for the next five years.

Popscene's name originates from the single by Blur. It became synonymous with the Britpop movement along with retro-themed rival Blow Up. Members of bands popular within the scene, such as Oasis, Blur, and Manic Street Preachers, were regular customers at both clubs. Popscene deliberately avoided a separate VIP area and made a selling point of the fact that everyone was equal once inside the doors. ‚ÄúSophie Ellis-Bextor came up to me and went, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm going to be a singer, I just sung Noel Gallagher ‚ÄòWonderwall‚Äô and he thought it was fantastic‚Äô‚Äù McCarthy recalled in an interview with DJ Mag. The night was also notable for the DJs taking centre stage in the venue. The DJ's accessibility led to patrons taking to the stage and dancing onstage alongside the DJ decks.

History  The diocese of Patti had an ancient precursor, the diocese of Tyndaris. Three of its bishops are known by name: * Severinus (501) * Eutychius (593)Eutychius wrote to Pope Gregory I, asking for aid against certain worshippers of idols and against 'Angelli'. Gregory replied that he had referred the matter to the Praetor of Sicily. P.

There was also a predecessor in the form of a Diocese of Lipari, which appears to have become extinct, perhaps due to Saracen raids in the 9th century.Lanzoni, pp. 654-655. The bishops known by name are: *Augustus (501, 502) *Venantius (553) *Agatho (593) *[Paulinus] (under Pope Gregory I)Paulinus was Bishop of Tauriana in the Abruzzi, and was ordered by Pope Gregory I to administer the diocese of Lipari and live there. In 597 Pope Gregory instructed the Bishop of Reggio and the Bishop of Lipari to come to Rome. Whether this was Paulinus, or a successor in the diocese of Lipari, is unknown. The importance of Patti grew, however, when Duke Robert Guiscard and Count Roger I founded on the island of Lipari Patti a Benedictine abbey, dedicated to Saint Bartholomew, in c. 1085;Pirro, p. 770. the abbey was joined to the Abbey of S. Salvatore when it was founded in 1094.The charters are quoted by Pirro, pp. 770-772. On 14 September 1131 Anacletus II, the pope from the double election of 1130 who was recognized in the Kingdom of Sicily, made the monastery of S. Bartholomew in Patti an episcopal see, and at the same time made the Abbey of Lipari an episcopal seat, uniting them in the person of one bishop, who would be consecrated by the Archbishop of Messana. The text of Pope Anacletus' bull is given in full in Pirro, pp. 387-388; and see pp. 770-771. The new See was endowed by King Roger II of Sicily, making it richer than the long established See of Syracuse. Pope Eugenius III in 1157 confirmed the action of Anacletus II. In 1206, it lost territory to establish the territorial prelature of Santa Lucia del Mela. Frederick III of Sicily (1295‚Äì1337) devastated Patti because the town was a supporter of his Angevin rivals, Robert and Philip of Naples.Cappelletti, p. 581. The French Pope John XXII, who supported the Angevins, laid all of Sicily under an interdict, which lasted from 1321 to 1335, causing severe problems between the Sicilian episcopate and the monarchy. On 18 April 1399, Lipari and Patti were separated,The text of the bull of Boniface IX is given by Pirro, p. 782. Eubel, I, p. 384 note 11. and the first bishop of the separate see of Patti was Francesco Hermemir. His predecessor, Francesco Gaptulus, continued as Bishop of Lipari. The Cathedral of S. Bartolommeo in Patti had a Chapter consisting of five dignities and nine Canons.Ritzler, V, p. 302 note 1. In 1827 the bishopric gained territory from the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Messina. On 20 May 1844 the diocese exchanged territory with the bishopric of Cefal√π. The diocese had in the early 20th century 49 parishes, 20,000 inhabitants, 5 religious houses of men, and 15 of sisters, conducting 4 institutes for girls and several schools.
