Rona-Frank originated from a low that developed on 9 February about to the northeast of Cairns. Over the next couple of days, the low slowly developed further before it was upgraded into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian intensity scale by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology on 10 February as it started to move towards the southwest. Subsequently, Rona rapidly intensified just before making landfall near the Cape York Peninsula. While the low-level circulation became difficult to locate on 12 February, the upper-level circulation eventually emerged into the Coral Sea and later regenerated into Tropical Cyclone Frank. The system rapidly intensified before making landfall on New Caledonia as a Category 2 cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale in the early morning hours of 20 February. Frank was re-classified as an extratropical cyclone the next day. Seven deaths were reported from Rona and a state of disaster was declared. Over 2,000 fled their homes due to flooding and many residents were caught off-guard for the storm. Significant crop damage was reported. Overall, Rona brought $150 million (1999 USD) in damage to Queensland. Minor damage was reported in New Caledonia. After the season, the name \\"Rona\\" was retired from the list of tropical cyclone names. Meteorological history On 9 February 1999, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) started to monitor a tropical low, that had developed within the monsoon trough about to the northeast of Cairns, in Queensland, Australia. At this time strong westerly winds persisted around the northern side of the low, however, a weak pressure gradient and light winds existed to the south of the system and the monsoon trough. This was because of a deep area of low pressure near south-eastern Queensland, had an intense pressure gradient to its south, which prevented the trade winds extending up to the monsoon trough. Throughout 9 February the tropical low moved eastwards under the influence of a middle-to upper-level trough over eastern Australia, however, over the next day the trough dissipated along with the deep area of low pressure. As a result, an area of strong ridging developed to the south of the system, while the trade winds rapidly extended northwards to the monsoon trough. The upper level pattern also became favorable for further development, with an outflow channel forming on the equator-ward side of the system. The low subsequently rapidly intensified during 10 February, with atmospheric convection surrounding the system dramatically improving. The system was subsequently named Rona by the BoM later that day, after it had developed into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. At around the same time the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories and designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 20P, after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm. As it was named the system was located about to the east of the northern Queensland coast, and had started to move towards the southwest under the influence of the subtropical ridge of high pressure. After the system had been named the system continued to intensify, and became a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale early on 11 February. The system subsequently moved rapidly west-northwest towards the Queensland coast as the ridge strengthened. Just before Rona made landfall the JTWC estimated that the system had peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of , this made it equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. However, during their post system analysis they lowered their estimate, to between which made it equivalent to a tropical storm. The BoM subsequently estimated that the system had peak 10-minute sustained wind speeds of when it made landfall on the Queensland coast, at around 1300 UTC (2300 EST) on 11 February just to the north of Cow Bay near the mouth of the Daintree River. The system maintained its west-northwest movement as it tracked over land, and according to the BoM maintained cyclone intensity until later that day after it had become difficult to track a definite low level centre. Over the next 24 hours the JTWC continued to track Rona as a tropical cyclone as it moved through the Great Dividing Range. Late on 12 February, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Rona after the system had weakened below cyclone intensity and deep convection, associated with the system had dissipated despite fair upper-level outflow. The JTWC subsequently tracked Rona's remnants into the Gulf of Carpentaria, however over the next few days the BoM tracked the systems remnant low to mid-level circulation as it moved southward. During 16 February, the system's low to mid-level circulation moved off Queensland's east coast, and tracked eastwards across the Coral Sea within the monsoon trough to the south of the subtropical ridge of high pressure. Early on February 17, the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 22P, while it was located about to the east- northeast of Rockhampton, Australia. Later on 18 February, RSMC Nadi remarked that Tropical Depression 16F had moved east of 160¬∞E and into their area of responsibility. Meanwhile, they also noted that 16F had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone and was thus named Frank. At the time of the upgrade, the storm was centered west-northwest of Noum√©a, New Caledonia. By this time, an upper-level trough over eastern Australia moved into the Tasman Sea. The poleward outflow of Frank improved; as a result, Frank rapidly intensified over the next 24 hours. Frank made landfall near the northern tip of New Caledonia at peak intensity with winds of 145 km/h (90 mph) at 0000 UTC on 20 February. Even though the JTWC operationally assessed the peak intensity at 185 km/h (115 mph), this was lowered to 175 km/h (110 mph) during post- storm analysis. After making landfall on New Caledonia, Frank maintained peak intensity for 18 hours. Soon afterwards, northwesterly wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures caused Frank to weaken rapidly. During the morning of 21 February, RSMC Nadi passed warning responsibility to Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited (TCWC Wellington) as the cyclone had moved south of 25¬∞S. Roughly 18 hours later, Frank merged with a trough to form an intense extratropical cyclone, which eventually made landfall on the South Island of New Zealand near Westport. TCWC Wellington stopped monitoring the system on 27 February. Impact and aftermath Satellite image of Severe Tropical Cyclone Rona near landfall on Queensland. =Australia= Initially, the system was not considered a major threat to Queensland. A day prior to landfall, the system was only considered a tropical low and was not expecting to intensify. Most residents did not know a powerful storm was coming until four hours before landfall. However, once officials realized that Rona‚ÄìFrank was a serious threat, they started taking precautions. In fact, they feared that if the storm struck at high tide, Townsville would be devastated. All air travel was cancelled about a day before landfall. Upon making landfall in Queensland, Cyclone Rona a maximum storm surge of was noted at the mouth of the Mossman River while a storm surge was recorded in Port Douglas. The highest rains associated with Rona, , were measured at Bellenden Ker in Northern Queensland. Cyclone Rona was responsible for the worst flooding in northern Queensland in 30 years. As a result, 2,000 people fled their homes. Strong winds and flooding caused significant crop and infrastructure damage from Cape Kimberly to Cape Tribulation. In the former, some trees were toppled. Near Daintree, two homes were destroyed, while 12 others were damaged. In addition, a car was crushed by a falling tree. Many workers were unable to get home due to flooding and travel was disrupted throughout the region. In all, seven deaths were attributed to the storm and damage estimates from Cyclone Rona totaled $150 million (1999 USD) in Queensland with roughly $100 million of that coming from crop damage. On February 12, a disaster area was declared for Cairns and Innisfail due to the severity of damage caused by the storm. Platypuses were spotted along the banks of flooded rivers. Both the names Frank and Rona were retired from the lists of tropical cyclone names after the system had dissipated. =New Caledonia= Cyclone Rona‚ÄìFrank affected two thirds of New Caledonia's Grande Terre island between 20‚Äì21 February. Several townships within the north-western parts of the archipelago suffered from power outages, disruption to water supply and telecommunications, while some landslides were reported on coastal roads. Despite the systems center passing about to the west of Noumea, the city experienced relatively light winds as the system possessed a very small radius of damaging winds. Royal New Zealand Air Force Orion and the Royal Australian Air Force launched a search and rescue mission during 22 February, after three men whose yacht had sunk went missing. The men were subsequently found by the Orion during the next day, while located about to the southwest of Noum√©a just outside the search zone. The French Navy vessel Jacques Cartier, subsequently picked the sailors up later that day.

She traveled a great deal throughout Europe in her lifetime as a result of living in a military family and later marrying another soldier. She is most known for writing her autobiography, Agneta Horns leverne (also spelled \\"lefverne\\"). Life Agneta Horn was the daughter of Gustav Horn, Count of Bj√∂rneborg and Kristina Oxenstierna, and the granddaughter of Axel Oxenstierna. She was born on 18 August 1629, in Riga in what is now Latvia, because her father was a Swedish military officer stationed outside of the country at the time of her birth. At six weeks of age, despite the unusual nature of a whole family living together in a Swedish military camp, Agneta and her mother joined Gustav at a camp in Kurland, in western Lithuania. The family lived there together through the fall and winter. In the spring when Gustav traveled to Germany with the military, Agneta and her mother returned to their Swedish home. Soon after, Agneta's younger brother Axel was born. The family was reunited with Gustav again in Neumark after Axel's birth. Horn writes: \\"Because she took us both with her and sailed to Germany and landed at Wolgast, where my father met her. Then, he took her and us with him to the army, which at the time was in Neumark\\" (Agneta Horn‚Äôs Leverne, 1910). Therefore, from a young age, Agneta was exposed to Swedish military campaigns, particularly the war between Sweden and Denmark. In her autobiography she recalls this experience: \\"But then came the King of Denmark and camped across from our army. And they began to shoot at each other's camps with guns. Because they were shooting so close together the bullets fell into our tent\\" (Agneta Horn‚Äôs Leverne, 1910). In 1634 Gustav Horn was captured by Imperialist military forces and held as a prisoner of war for eight years. Kristina died when Agneta was a child. Her father remarried, and Agneta was raised for much of her childhood by Ebba Leijonhufvud, a \\"cold and heartless\\" aunt. Agneta continued to witness Swedish military life as an adult. She had no interest in civilian men and wanted only to marry a soldier; allegedly, she rejected one non-military man by burning his own gloves and dousing him in hot wax. Horn eventually married the \\"brav soldat\\" (\\"strong/brave soldier\\") Lars Kruus in 1648. As a married couple, they lived together in Poland and Germany. She regarded this time together as a period of \\"hardships and tribulations\\". Agneta experienced unpleasant and difficult travel and multiple bouts of illness. In her autobiography, she wrote: \\"And I was so sick and so tired. Both from the trip by sea and the journey in a peasant wagon that shook me. I was so stiff, I could not manage to move when I arrived\\" (Agneta Horn‚Äôs Leverne, 1910). Lars died in a campaign in Poland when Agneta was 26; together, they had four children. She returned to Sweden and never remarried. As a widow, Horn maintained an active life. Horn was an involved and prominent member of \\"religious life of her community\\" and was active in running her estates. She undertook a project to completely raze and rebuild a church in Bj√∂rklinge. However, religious leaders in the region (Uppsala) convinced her to be content with a large-scale renovation and remodeling. Her influence and work can still be seen in the church today. There is a plaque commemorating Horn and her husband, as well as a portrait of a mother with two children, believed to be a representation of Horn. She died at the age of 42. Writing Horn's only known work is her autobiography, Agneta Horn‚Äôs Leverne, written around 1650, five years after her husband's death and her return to Sweden. These memoirs were first discovered in 1885, and while largely dealing with personal issues such as family deaths and conflicts, they are written in the context of Sweden's culture of the time, including such conflicts as the Thirty Years' War. Her manuscript was handwritten and hand-bound by Horn, and some now believe that the sections of her autobiography are in an order different from her original plan. The book is believed to have been written for personal, private readership, addressing both her stepmother Sigrid Bielke and her four children. This theory may be verified by the fact that Horn often glosses over details or background information when writing about a situation. She assumes that her readers are already familiar with the events she describes. Her diary has been considered by some to be the first Swedish novel. Agneta Horn‚Äôs Leverne is broken into several different sections. The last six leaves of the original manuscript are quotes from the Biblical Psalms or Book of Job. Job is a righteous man who endures many trials and sufferings at the hand of God, but he never questions or challenges God's nature. He simply accepts the trials as they come. The primary message from the Book of Job is the question of why the righteous suffer. Given the difficult life Agneta Horn experienced, in her childhood in military camps and with her aunt, and then later as an adult, again living in military camps and experiencing the death of her husband, these introductory quotes are particularly significant. In thirteen instances, Horn changed the quotes to use first person or feminine pronouns, presumably so make the quotes \\"refer specifically to her . . . [and] to her situation.\\" One can gather that Horn identified strongly with the Biblical Job, and related her own life's struggles to the constant hardships he experienced. Yet quoting Job also demonstrates that she felt the proper response to challenges in her life was to endure and carry on despite suffering. However, as Job experiences physical pain, Horn's strife is mostly related to her emotional pain. She recounts few joyous or happy experiences in her autobiography. Notably missing is an account of her wedding to Kruus. Horn's work is also regarded as significant because of her unique use of language. For one, she \\"has no detachment from the characters in her autobiography\\". She writes about the people in her life \\"with passion,\\" in a style that is emotional and engaging rather than removed and objective. She \\"does not seek to explain facts, but to replay and analyze emotions\\". Her writing is also regarded by as being especially informal and of a \\"brisk everyday style.\\" This briskness is interspersed with \\"an almost Biblical style\\" in the section of her work where she quotes from Job and Psalms. Horn's writing has also been noted for her unique linguistic choices. For instance, in some cases she combined the endings of traditional written and oral Swedish to form new versions of the words. Leverne is one of the first known written works by a Swedish woman, as well as one of the only published works to date that features a female perspective of the Swedish imperial military. It is the single most comprehensive work about and insight into the life of an individual Swede before the 1700s. Critical response Though Horn's autobiography is generally well received, some critics have accused her work of being hysterical, base, or gaudy. These critics have ignored Horn's well-deserved place in the history of Swedish prose and autobiographical writing. Other scholars have deemed their criticism misguided, for it inappropriately conflates the writer and the individual. Stephen A. Mitchell writes, \\"What is so very mistaken about such comments, of course, is that they tend to interpret [Horn‚Äôs] actions as the protagonist of the autobiography, rather than examining the delicate balance between the writer and her heroine\\".

The first branch, the P√°draig Pearse Branch, was founded in Sydney in 1915. Its current headquarters are located at INA House in Devonshire St, Surry Hills, near Central Station. Since its establishment in 1915, the INA has worked for the Irish community and cared for the welfare of Irish immigrants in Sydney and throughout the region. Today, the INA still cares for the development of the Irish-Australian cultural activities and the welfare of the Irish people in Australia.  History of the INA  Foundation: War and revolution When the Home Rule Bill was deferred at the outbreak of the First World War, Albert Thomas Dryer, the 27-year-old Australian-born son of an Irish mother and a part-German, part-Irish father decided that it was time to rally Irish- Australian opinion to assist Ireland to achieve her national destiny. On 21 July 1915, at a meeting in Sydney of 18 Irish people, Dryer proposed a resolution to establish an Irish National Association to serve and strengthen the Irish community in Australia, and to help preserve the ideal of Ireland's sovereignty. The new organisation grew rapidly, organising social evenings, Irish dancing and language classes, card nights, plays and lectures. The first Irish National Concert was held in the Sydney Town Hall on 23 November 1915, and by January 1916 the INA had 211 financial members. In that month the Interim Committee handed over to the first elected committee, headed by Peter O'Loughlin and with Albert Dryer as Secretary. From its inception it was intended that the INA be a national organisation, with branches in various cities and an overall national executive. In the early days there were branches in Brisbane, Queensland and Melbourne, Victoria, but these never took off. Later in the 1940s and 1950s Dryer managed to whip up Melbourne, Brisbane and Canberra branches, but again they were short-lived. The P√°draig Pearse Branch in Sydney remains the only surviving branch of the INA. The nationalist aims of the INA became even more important in 1916, as Dryer and the rest of the Irish community watched helplessly while Britain crushed the Easter Rising and proceeded to execute sixteen of its leaders. Whilst the INA continued its social and cultural activities, the political purpose of the association came increasingly to the fore. In a war-time British colony, already bitterly divided over the conscription issue, it was inevitable that Irish nationalists would be regarded as sinister subversives. On Monday, 17 June 1918, Albert Dryer and six other INA office-bearers were arrested under emergency war-time regulations, and imprisoned without trial. Apart from Dryer they were Thomas Fitzgerald, secretary of the Brisbane branch, Maurice Dalton and Frank McKeown of the Melbourne branch, and Edmund McSweeny, Michael McGing and William McGuinness of the Sydney branch. The seven were accused of membership of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, and were held in Sydney's Darlinghurst Gaol for several months. Six were released on 19 December 1918, but Albert Dryer was held until 11 February 1919. The political situation in Ireland was changing rapidly through the late 1910s and early 1920s. While the INA carried on its cultural and social activities and offered what support it could to the struggle for Irish independence, it was inevitable that the division of opinion over the Treaty would be reflected on the Australian scene. The forces against the Anglo-Irish Treaty, including the INA, continued their political campaign in Australia with protest meetings, leaflets and newspapers, as well as collecting money to send home to Ireland. Although the Irish community was divided, the Australian Government still feared that the seditious Irish would stir up trouble. On Monday, 30 April 1923, when two Republican speakers arrived to address a meeting at Waverley in Sydney's Eastern suburbs, they were arrested. The Irish Envoys, as they became known, were Sean J. O'Kelly (President of the Gaelic League, Sinn F√©in TD for Louth‚ÄìMeath, and later President of Sinn F√©in), and Fr Michael O'Flanagan (Vice-President of Sinn F√©in and a judge in the D√°il Courts during the Irish War of Independence). After a judicial enquiry the Envoys were deported from Australia. Despite the Envoys incident, the Irish community in Australia was increasingly divided, and showed little interest in the INA's political activism. By 1926, even the INA's weekly c√©il√≠ (dance evening), in its premises in George St, Sydney, was forced to compete with a rival function in nearby Flinders St. Nevertheless, the 1926 Easter concert raised ¬£120 to be sent home to √âamon de Valera. It was the last regular remittance, as later that year de Valera led the Fianna F√°il split from Sinn F√©in. Dan Minogue: Decline then reconstruction During the 1920s the INA moved several times, and support declined. By the early 1930s several general meetings lapsed for want of a quorum. In March 1934, a reconstruction committee was elected. The Irish community soon rallied to the support of the INA, and by the 1940s the association was entering its golden age. It was at this time that the second great figure came onto the Sydney Irish scene Dan Minogue. A native of County Clare, Dan Minogue came to Australia in the 1910s, and for over 30 years it was his vision which shaped the course of the INA. The first stage of Dan Minogue's vision for the INA, was to purchase land in Devonshire St, Surry Hills to establish a cultural centre for the Irish in Sydney. He and the Committee worked hard to raise the money to build the centre and in develop a cohesive Irish community to patronise it. The founders of the INA were mainly working people with few political contacts, but the INA of the 1940s was dominated by those successful in politics. Dan Minogue was an alderman on the Sydney City Council along with two other INA Executive members, Tony Doherty and Eric Drew. Dan Minogue was elected Federal member for the seat of West Sydney. Deputy federal leader of the Australian Labor Party, and one-time Prime Minister, Frank Forde, was also a member of the INA. One of the problems faced by the INA, during the first 40 years of its existence was the dominance of Irish affairs in Australia by the Catholic Church. When the INA was formed, the inclusion of non-sectarianism among its aims was condemned by Cardinal Kelly. Nearly thirty years later, the INA again came up against the Church when it tried to use the proceeds of the 1944 St Patrick's Day sports carnival to build a hail for the Irish people in Sydney. Proceeds of St Patrick's Day activities had traditionally gone to the Catholic orphanages and the next year the Church took over the organisation of the sports carnival from the INA. The association finally won back control of the St Patrick's Day sports carnival in 1957, and continued on for over 20 years until it revived of the St Patrick's Day Parade in 1979. Before the Devonshire Street site was developed, the INA ran dances at St Benedict's church hall in Broadway. The Sunday night c√©il√≠s were well attended, and the ranks of the Irish were swelled by new immigrants arriving under the Labor Government's immigration programme introduced in the late 1940s. Strangely, there was some opposition to these immigrants from those Australian Irish who believed they should have stayed at home to build up the new Irish Republic. Nevertheless, it was the immigrants who proved to be the lifeblood of the INA through the 1950s. 1948 saw one of the most historical events in Irish Australian history. In that year the former Taoiseach and 1916 veteran √âamon de Valera made a controversial visit to Australia to campaign for an end to the partition of Ireland. Albert Dryer organised the Sydney leg of de Valera's visit under the auspices of the INA. In the early 1950s the membership of the INA was thriving. In 1951 the first annual Feis was held at the Sydney Sports Ground and over the years this was built into a national contest in Gaelic and other sports, Irish dancing and piping. A new home for the INA In 1953, the existing terrace houses in Devonshire Street were demolished, and as well as the c√©il√≠s and other cultural events the first issue of the newspaper \\"Sydney Gael\\" was published. Other activities of the INA included an annual lecture at Sydney University, housie, Irish dancing, the pipe band, and the upkeep of the 1798 Memorial at Waverley Cemetery. Finally, in 1956, the INA Cultural Centre was completed with the help of a ¬£37,000 loan. There was a grand opening on 16 September by Dan Minogue in the presence of Albert Dryer, the Irish charg√© d'affaires and the mayor of Sydney, and a crowd of over two thousand. The opening of the centre led to another upsurge in activity in the INA. In those days the kiosk on the building's mezzanine floor serviced the dances on the ground floor and the various meetings, card nights and band practices on the first floor. By 1958 the INA activities had expanded to include an Irish trade promotion group, a recreation group, ladies' auxiliary, drama group, handball, library and c√©il√≠ dances. The Victorian branch of the INA, re-established two years earlier, was still in operation. There were also ongoing events to be organised, such as the St. Patrick's Day sports, and the national Gaelic Festival. As the INA moved into the 1960s the momentum continued. Irish goods were sold and the trade committee was flourishing, as were Irish dancing, drama, c√©il√≠, handball and golf groups. The major festivals were the interstate Feis, the St Patrick's Day sports carnival and the Easter concert. 1963 saw the end of an era with the death of the INA's founder, Dr Albert Dryer on 11 April. The reduction in the number of Irish immigrants arriving in Australia and the inevitable personality clashes which had developed within the enclosed Irish community soon led to a decline in the INA's membership. One by one the national Feis, handball, card nights and other activities were discontinued. Dan Minogue, detecting the assimilation of the Irish community and the need to compete with mainstream entertainment venues for their patronage, pressed ahead with providing a licensed club for the Irish community. It was to be Dan Minogue's last mission in the Irish community, and he officially opened The Gaelic Club on the first floor of the INA building in 1974. Reform and expansion The INA continued on, surviving the changes as it had for 60 years. Nevertheless, action grew from conflict, and in the late 1970s a Reform Committee emerged from the young, more recent Irish immigrants, bringing new ideas. In 1979 the St Patrick's Day Parade was revived, and another new era began. Soon the Parade festivities expanded to Irish Week with parliamentary and media patronage, and the INA reached out to other Irish organisations and to the Irish Australian community for support and organisational assistance. In the 1980s, the ground floor was leased and became a cinema for a time. By the end of the 1990s the INA took back control of the ground floor and renovated it, extending The Gaelic Club to two floors. Eventually, though, the ground floor was sold to become a separate venue, while the Gaelic Club continues on the first floor, holding c√©il√≠s, concerts, meetings and other events for the Irish community.  The Irish National Association Today  As it heads towards its centenary, the Irish National Association of Australasia still continues to work for the Irish community, holding Irish music concerts and regular dances, sponsoring dancing classes, and Irish language classes. The Association also maintains the Albert Dryer Memorial Library, containing many rare antiquarian volumes collected and donated over the decades, including a copy of the Book of Kells donated by √âamon de Valera himself. Although the St Patrick's Day Parade, the Australian Irish Welfare Bureau and Irish Language School, Sydney are now independent organisations, they still maintain strong links to the INA. The INA continues to grow and develop in the new century, expanding its dance and music evenings and establishing a School of Irish Music in 2009. While its political activism has declined since the Independence of Ireland has become assured, the INA still commemorates the Easter Rising every Easter Sunday at the Irish 1798 Rebellion Memorial in Waverley Cemetery, over the grave of Michael Dwyer.

Beginning in 1991, his original music compositions were used for many Robin Leach hosted television shows that ran in syndication for several years including Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous and Runaway with the Rich & Famous. His music was also used for the 1993 syndicated television show World's Best 1992. Beginnings Dan Pinto began his career in 1974 as a rock and roll drummer and shortly afterward branched out to various forms of percussion and keyboards. Prior to his success as a composer, while continuing with the pre-established need to keep up on many forms of drums and percussion, he began to branch out by first developing his skill at the piano. A self-educated musician on all the instruments that he plays, Pinto learned while borrowing between full size pianos of one kind or another until he was able to afford his own. He then quickly moved into many types of electronic keyboards. Dedicating equal time toward both instrument groups, it wasn't long before he was performing as a multi-keyboardist and drummer-percussionist both live and in the studio on a regular basis. It would be difficult to view Pinto's involvement on any one instrument without eventually including the other. He has been using varying combinations of both instruments throughout his entire career thus having molded himself into becoming a genuine multi-instrumentalist. Music style and composition Initially establishing his music style stemming from keyboard progressive rock bands of the early 1970s, his later studies of creating an orchestral sound played an even more important role in his development as a music writer. So too would his deeply rooted interest in movies having attempted creations of his own at a very young age with his father's 8mm camera long before he became involved with composing music. With this foundation, Pinto alternated between composing music for orchestra with a film soundtrack style and releasing solo projects in the realm of Progressive Rock and Jazz fusion. Pinto's music has been the backdrop over the years for industrial and commercial projects for AT&T;, CNN, BMW and RCA. In 2006 he was nominated for Best Instrumental Song of the Year in the Just Plain Folks Music Awards for music from his Ivory Towers CD release recognizing his accomplishments as a new-age music composer. With his 2008 release of Anomalies he combined progressive jazz-rock fusion with film score music redeveloping his style yet again into what has become a multi-tiered methodology. Live and studio performance Four years after he began composing original music, Pinto debuted his efforts in 1981 as the keyboardist/drummer-percussionist for the original progressive rock band, Juice when they opened for Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, broadcast live on WDHA. With this performance, as with most others early in his career, although keyboards had become the most crucial element that forged Pinto's creative output, his origin still remained an integral part of his makeup which usually included a highlighted drum duet with the band's regular drummer. As a drummer-percussionist, aside from performing all of the work on his own CD releases, he played on an album release by 3 Point Play featuring Dave LaRue, bassist for the Dixie Dregs & the Steve Morse Band. He was the keyboardist with WainWave Music record label recording artist, Doug Wain resulting in a live CD release that was recorded at the Ritz in New York in 1988. Pinto has also performed live on stage with members of MCA recording artist Trixter. Equipment As a multi-instrumentalist, Pinto's use of equipment covers ground in two main areas. As a drummer he uses mostly Pearl drums with a combination of Zildjian, Paiste and Sabian cymbals. He also incorporates a wide variety of percussion including Ludwig-Musser orchestra bells and temple blocks, Slingerland timbales and Paiste gongs. Electronics play an important role with his use of drums in conjunction with keyboard sound modules. As a keyboardist, since his first electronic keyboard purchase, a Moog Music Minimoog synthesizer, he has since evolved through a series of Moogs including a Ribbon controller and electronic drum synthesizers. He's used Oberheim and Roland Corporation synths and a variety of Korg keyboards before settling in on Kurzweil Music Systems. He has also owned an array of varying types of electric pianos including Yamaha's CP-80 and Roland's RD-1000. Beyond the music Beyond working as a composer/musician, Pinto has many other attributes. He produces and engineers all of the music that he writes in a privately owned recording studio that facilitates his needs exclusively. And in a 2009 live interview on Blogtalkradio, he explained about how in 1994 he dedicated several years of work into writing a screenplay, producing, directing and editing a movie for the sole purpose of writing the film score. While Pinto went on to say that the film itself was an independent unofficial release, the music was released on CD with Eclectic Sound Records in 1999. Pinto often gets involved with side projects, as when he and Horace Ott, primary composer for \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\", joined to make a presentation on scoring music for films at the Memfest Film Festival in New Jersey in 2006. Musical influences While Pinto credits his musical influences to many individual artists, Keith Emerson is one in particular who has had more of an impact than most. His music has also been compared to a variety of different music group sounds including what has been quoted as being a more original sounding version of Kansas, as well as a style similar to that of Return to Forever but with an arguably more accessible sound.

Johnston was born to a wealthy family in Bogarttown, Ontario that owned lumber and flour mills in Simcoe County.John Frederick Johnston 1876-1948, Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan He moved to Saskatchewan in 1905 and ultimately settled on a farm near Bladworth, Saskatchewan. In addition to his farm, he owned a lumberyard and hardware store in town and developed a string of general stores in the region. He was elected by acclamation to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1917 wartime election as a Liberal-Unionist representing Last Mountain. The Liberal Party had split over the Conscription Crisis of 1917 and Johnston was one of the Liberals who broke with Sir Wilfrid Laurier in order to support the pro-conscription Union Government formed by Conservative Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden. During the parliament, Johnston broke with both the government and the Liberals to support the new agrarian based Progressive Party formed by Thomas Crerar. He won the Progressive Party nomination in his riding and was re-elected in the 1921 federal election as a Progressive MP and became the party's chief whip in the House of Commons of Canada. Johnston supported co-operation between the Progressives and the Liberals. He was re-electedas a Progressive MP, this time in the riding of Long Lake in the 1925 federal election. The Liberals lost seats in the election but stayed in power leading a minority government. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King convinced Johnston to cross the floor and join the Liberals in early 1926 in an attempt to buttress his government's support. He was re-elected as a Liberal in the 1926 federal election and, in December 1926, became Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada. Johnston was defeated in the 1930 federal election by his Conservative opponent and returned to the farm. He was again elected to parliament in the 1935 federal election, this time in the riding of Lake Centre but was defeated in the 1940 federal election by John George Diefenbaker of the Tories. Johnston was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Mackenzie King in 1943 and sat in the upper house until his death in 1948.

He was a left-footed place-kicker who played for Bo Schembechler at the University of Michigan from 1972 through 1974. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1973 and set Michigan records for the longest field goal, most field goals, and most point after touchdown kicks. However, he also missed three key field goals in the last minutes of the 1973 and 1974 Michigan‚ÄìOhio State games. Early years and military service A native of Oxford, Michigan, Lantry enlisted in the U.S. Army after graduating from high school. He spent three years in the Army, including service in the Vietnam War. Lantry's experiences in Vietnam and Michigan were the subject of Michael Rosenberg's 2008 book, War As They Knew It: Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and America in a Time of Unrest.Michael Rosenberg, War As They Knew It: Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler, and America in a Time of Unrest Lantry later recalled, \\"For a full year, my parents agonized, hoping they wouldn't get the call that so many other parents received.\\" In 2007, Lantry described himself as \\"a proud Vietnam veteran\\". University of Michigan After his discharge from the Army, Lantry enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1971. Unlike most college athletes, Lantry was a 23-year-old freshman who was married, had a young child, and had seen combat action in Vietnam. And he had no scholarship. He made the Michigan football team as a walk-on. Lantry earned a spot on the team in 1971 and was Michigan's first-string place-kicker for all 33 games of the 1972, 1973 and 1974 seasons. In addition to football, Lantry was also a shot putter who earned three varsity letters at Michigan. Lantry graduated from Michigan's School of Education in 1975. =1973 season= In September 1973, Lantry broke the Michigan record for longest field goal twice in the same quarter of a single football game. Nine seconds into the second quarter of a 47‚Äì10 win over Stanford, Lantry kicked a 50-yard field goal to break the school record. In the waning moments of the quarter, Lantry broke his own record by kicking a 51-yard field goal. After the record was broken twice in the span of a 15-minute quarter, Lantry's record stood for 11 years until 1984 when Bob Bergeron kicked a 52-yard field goal for Michigan. In the 1973 Michigan‚ÄìOhio State game, Lantry missed two key fourth- quarter field goal attempts. With the game tied 10‚Äì10, and 1:01 remaining in the game, Lantry attempted a 58-yard field goal but the kick was wide to the left, missing by inches. Michigan intercepted an Ohio State pass on the first play of the ensuing drive, and Lantry got another shot at a game-winning field goal with 24 seconds left to play. His attempt at a 44-yard field goal went wide by about three inches, and the game ended in a 10‚Äì10 tie. Both teams finished the 1973 season with identical 10‚Äì0‚Äì1 records, and the Big Ten Conference athletic directors voted to send Ohio State to the 1974 Rose Bowl. Because Big Ten rules at that time allowed only one team to play in a post- season bowl game, Michigan did not play in a bowl game despite having an undefeated season. Lantry was selected by Football News as a first-team All- American in 1973.All-America, All-Conference Teams New York Times, December 2, 1973, Page 276. =1974 season= In his senior season in 1974, Lantry broke the Michigan school record for most field goals and point after touchdown kicks. The prior record of 107 point after touchdown kicks had stood since 1947. Lantry was again called on to attempt a critical field goal in the 1974 Michigan-Ohio State game. Ohio State led 12‚Äì10 nearing the end of the fourth quarter. Lantry was brought in to attempt a game-winning field goal and a chance for redemption. One newspaper described the scene as follows: > There were 16 seconds to play when Mike Lantry's left leg boomed the ball. > The distance was 33 yards. The angle was very bad and very tough and from a > wide side of the field. Mike Lantry's kick was very high. The officials > looked for an agonizingly long, long time. They finally made their signal No > good. Wide. Not by much. Inches again. But still no good. Close. There was > that word again, that awful word that had tormented Mike Lantry for a whole > year. Close.\\" The game was broadcast on national television, and as Ohio State fans came flooding onto the field to celebrate, the camera followed Lantry as he picked up his tee, and in the words of game announcer Keith Jackson \\"walked disconsolately toward the sideline.\\" The image of Lantry walking slowly to the sideline became one of the iconic images of the Michigan‚ÄìOhio State rivalry. Because of the severe angle, several people believed Lantry's kick was actually good, and this has been used to advocate for the use of cameras on the uprights to permit replay review of ambiguous kicks in the future. The Chicago Tribune opened its coverage of the game with the line, \\"Mike Lantry served in the Viet Nam War and he had reason to believe the worst was over‚Äîuntil Saturday.\\" After consecutive years with disappointments on last- minute field goal attempts, one sports writer joked that \\"perhaps the state of Michigan was going to form a lynch mob for Mike Lantry.\\" Instead, Lantry received thousands of letters from fans expressing compassion, sympathy and encouragement. Even Ohio State Coach Woody Hayes expressed his sympathy for Lantry: \\"I hate to see that happen to a kid like that because he served his country in Vietnam, but if it had to happen, I'm glad it happened against us.\\" Lantry told reporters at the time, \\"I guess the biggest surprise is the way people have acted. They're suffering with me. They've been more than kind. I wish there was a way I could thank them all.\\" Interviewed in 2004 about the missed kick in the 1974 Ohio State game, Lantry recalled: \\"I was numb. That was the final play of my college career right there. Everything you worked for, those glorious years of competition, my teammates. ... If we had won that game, we would have played in the Rose Bowl. We could have shot to the top of the AP and UPI rankings. Who knows? That was like the World Series: bases loaded, bottom of the ninth, two outs, a 3‚Äì2 count. It was on my foot, but it didn't happen.\\" See also *1973 College Football All-America Team References Michigan Wolverines football players United States Army soldiers American army personnel of the Vietnam War 1940s births Living people People from Oxford, Michigan ","title":"Mike Lantry"},{"id":"23781775","text":"The Skin Tyee First Nation, also known as the Skin Tyee Indian Band is a First Nations band government located in the Central Interior of British Columbia near Fran√ßois Lake, in the Omineca Country to the west of the City of Prince George.

Hata Building is a historic structure in Hilo, Hawaii built by Japanese businessman Hata Sadanosuke (1868 - ?) in 1912. It now contains specialty shops, professional offices, and a Cafe Pesto restaurant. Hata family Hata Sadanosuke was born in Hiroshima, Japan in 1868 and immigrated to Honolulu, Hawaii in 1891. In 1893, Mr. Hata worked as an agent for Odo Shoten in Honolulu (\\"shoten\\" means \\"store\\" in Japanese), responsible for taking orders from large sugarcane plantations on the HƒÅmƒÅkua Coast which employed many Japanese immigrant workers. This gave him the inspiration to start his own business at Hilo on the Big Island on January 3, 1896 called S. Hata Shoten, Limited. He sold Japanese silks, kimonos, as well as eastern souvenirs and provisions. Business was slow in the first years, so he hired out his horse and hackney carriage as a taxicab for visitors. After the annexation by the United States to become the Territory of Hawaii in 1898, the plantations flourished, as did his business. He moved to a larger building at the corner of Mamo and Keawe streets. He branched out back to Honolulu and Hiroshima, Osaka, Japan, Kyoto, Japan, and Yokohama, Japan. Hata Yoichi, Sadanosuke's younger brother (born 1884) also arrived in Hilo and worked as bookkeeper at S. Hata Shoten. The business was so prosperous in 1912 that it needed more space. The previous building became a wholesale food distributing outlet run by Hata Yoichi. Sadanosuke planned a new $25,000 structure on wetlands on Front Street (later renamed Kamehameha Avenue) near the railroad tracks to the plantations. A condition of the United States government's selling this land was that Mr. Hata builds concrete building within a year's time. =Building= At the time it was built, almost all other structures in Hawai'i outside of Honolulu were built of wood. The building is about by of reinforced concrete. Such a large masonry building indicated the upward mobility of the Japanese population. The Hilo Masonic Lodge, Hilo Federal Building and Volcano Block Building are the others from that period that remain. The first floor has several store-fronts. A wooden staircase leads to a second floor of office space, with 14 arched windows. In 1913 he opened the Hilo Sake Brewing Company. In 1919 two wood structures were added to the back, one commercial and one residential. After the attack on Pearl Harbor the Hata family was part of the Japanese American internment. In September 1942 (during the Second World War) the Hata Building was seized and later auctioned by the U.S. government. Hata's second daughter, Kagawa Kasujiro, purchased the building at that time. Because it was so solidly built, it survived the tsunami caused by the April 1, 1946 Aleutian Islands earthquake that devastated much of Hilo. The train tracks of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway were destroyed in that tsunami, so the building now is on the commercial street nearest the ocean. The path of the railroad was used for the new Hawaii Belt Road (state route 19), called the Waterfront Highway at this point. The building originally had a full basement, but it was filled in following another major tsunami from the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Its condition deteriorated and by 1990 it was scheduled to be demolished. David Levenson bought the property from Hata's descendants, renovated the interior while restoring the exterior, and rented it to a number of local businesses. The metal awning between the two stories was replaced, but the wrought iron brackets were restored. It is located at 308 Kamehameha Avenue, coordinates . The Hilo Farmers Market was started on this block in 1988, held every Wednesday and Saturday at the end of Mamo Street. The building was listed as state historic site 10-35-7420 on January 14, 1989Historic Places in Hawaii County on official state web site and added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii on August 27, 1991 as site 91001087. The family formed the Sadanosuke Hata Charitable Foundation in 1999 which supports the Japanese Cultural Center of Hawaii in Honolulu. In 2003 the building was sold to the Takeyama family. =Yoichi Hata= Yoichi Hata married Naeko Hirata in 1905, and they had 8 sons and 1 daughter. These include Susumu (1917‚Äì2003), Yukiko (1918‚Äì2000), Minoru, Akira, Yoshimi, Frank J. and others. He became a director of the newly formed Peoples Bank of Hilo on September 1, 1916. The Y. Hata company was incorporated as a separate entity in 1922, and is still run by a descendant. Branches were opened in Osaka in 1936 and Honolulu in 1937. After the 1960 tsunami, the original wholesale building on Ponahawai Street was abandoned, and offices were moved to a new industrial area, 300 Kanoelehua Avenue in Hilo, and 285 Sand Island Road in Honolulu. In addition to food distribution to markets across the Hawaiian islands, restaurant supplies and chef services are now offered. They are also the major supplier to the U.S. military in Hawaii. Yoichi's son Minoru was CEO from the 1960s until the late 90s and then Yoichi's son Frank was chairman until 2008, and Frank's son Russell Hata took over in May, 2008. An exhibit at the discovery center MokupƒÅpapa Discovery Center The MokupƒÅpapa Discovery Center has moved down the street into the historical Koehnen Building (76 Kamehameha Ave., Hilo, HI). In May 2003, the MokupƒÅpapa Discovery Center opened in the restored S. Hata building. It displays educational interactive exhibits on the Leeward Islands, which are protected along with their surrounding waters as the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument. The name comes from MokupƒÅpapa in the Hawaiian language which means \\"flat/low reef island\\". This name was used in chants of Ancient Hawaii, perhaps referring to the area now known as French Frigate Shoals, or the northwestern islands in general. The Northwestern islands stretch for hundreds of miles northwest of the main Hawaiian islands; the discovery center is on the southeasternmost island in the chain, Hawai'i Island, which is the youngest and farthest away from the much older k≈´puna islands in the Monument. A salt-water aquarium displays some of the fish found on Hawaiian reefs. One entire wall is covered by a large mural painted by local artist Layne Luna depicting the coral reef ecosystems found in the leeward islands. Layne Luna also created several life-sized models of life sized sharks, fish and manta ray that hang from the ceiling. Another exhibit plays a recording of the creation chant of Hawaiian mythology known as Kumulipo. Signs are in the Hawaiian language and English. Admission to the new center is still free although donations are accepted to support all of the National Marine Sanctuaries. It is open Tuesday through Saturday 9AM to 4PM, closed on Federal holidays.

The Washington Post has pointed out similarities to Shaq Vs. and Todd Gallagher's book Andy Roddick Beat Me with a Frying Pan saying the book and the show have \\"precisely the same premise\\" and that a TV show based on the book Gallagher was trying to sell was \\"the exact same show.\\" TMZ later reported that Gallagher and O'Neal shared the same agent and the agent had previously shopped a virtually identical show with Gallagher. Gallagher's name appears in the credits of season 2 as a producer. The Arizona Republic reported that in early 2008 Steve Nash, a former teammate of O'Neal's, had mentioned to O'Neal a reality show he was pursuing that would feature Nash taking on professional athletes in their own sport. O'Neal said Nash's idea was based on training with other athletes, not competing against them. Nash would not confirm the Republic's story and said, \\"We collaborated on parts of the show.\\" Nash is an executive producer of the program.

She is deemed to bring good fortune, prosperity, attract customers to a business, and found among merchants. Commonly dressed in red Thai style clothing, Nang Kwak is an incarnation of Mae Po Sop, the Thai rice goddess. She is a version of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi. Iconography Nang Kwak is represented as a beautiful woman wearing a red dress (not always, but more often than other colors) fashioned in the Thai style. She also wears a golden crown on her head and is in the sitting or kneeling position. Her right hand is raised in the Thai way of beckoning a customer, with the palm of the hand curved and pointing downwards. Her left hand is resting on her side or holds a bag full of gold near her lap. The present iconographic figure of Nang Kwak is an incarnation of Mae Po Sop (‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡πÇ‡∏û‡∏™‡∏û), the Siamese rice goddess.Pairin Jotisakulratana, Mae Po sop: The Rice Mother of Thailand However, unlike Mae Po Sop, Nang Kwak does not wear the harvested rice sheaf on her right shoulder. The iconography of Nang Kwak is based in the Hindu goddess Sri Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, fortune and prosperity.Jonathan Lee, Fumitaka Matsuoka, Edmond Yee and Ronald Nakasone (2015), Asian American Religious Cultures, ABC, , page 892 The position of her hand in present-day iconography is similar to the Japanese Maneki Neko beckoning cat.Nang Kwak, Background information Symbolism Nang Kwak is a benevolent spirit. She is deemed to bring luck, especially in the form of money, to the household. She is the patron Deity of all Merchants and Salesmen and can be seen in almost every business establishment in ThailandAstrologers Thai people like to have a figurine or cloth poster (called a Pha Yant, or Yantra Cloth) of this goddess in their home or shop, where it is often placed by the shrine. Some people also wear amulets with her figure around the neck, which is a logical development, due to the fact that many people in Thailand must travel around to sell their wares, which makes a portable nang Kwak amulet the obvious choice for such a person. Legends Although Nang Kwak is more a figure of popular folklore than a religious deity, there are Buddhist legends that seek to incorporate her into the Buddhist fold. ;Brahmin trading family legend One Buddhist legend presents Nang Kwak as Nang Supawadee (or Subhavadi) of a Brahmin trading family that converted to Buddhism.Ara Wilson (2008), The Sacred Geography of Bangkok‚Äôs Markets, International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, Volume 32.3, September 2008, page 635 According to this legend, in the small town of Michikasandhanakara, in the Indian province of Sawadtii, there was a married family, Sujidtaprahma and his wife Sumanta, who had a daughter named Supawadee. They were merchants who sold small amounts of wares on the markets, only earning just enough to maintain their small family from day to day. One day, they were discussing their hopes and dreams for the future, and decided that they should try to expand their business to make more profit and begin to think of being able to save something for their old age. As a result of this conversation, they decided to try to afford to buy a gwian (cart) in order to use to travel with and sell their wares to other towns and villages. They also then brought wares from the other towns to sell in Sawadtii and Michigaasandhanakara when they returned. Sometimes, Supawadee would ask to tag along for the ride, and help them. One day, as Supawadee was helping her parents to sell wares in a distant town, she was lucky to be able to hear a sermon by Phra Gumarn Gasaba Thaera; she was so convinced and moved by his sermon, that she became Buddhist. When Gasaba Thaera saw her faith and devotion, he collected all his powers of thought and concentration, for he was an Arahant, and bestowed blessings of good fortune and luck in salesmanship on Nang Supawadee and her family. ;Ramakian epic legend Another Thai legend presents Nang Kwak as the woman who defended a king from a demon in the epic Ramakian. She, thereafter gained the boon (merit) of fortune and prosperity wherever she was. Nang Kwak was the daughter of Pu Chao Khao Khiao, meaning 'Grandfather Lord of the Green Mountain' (Khao Khiao). Pu Chao Khao Khiao was a Lord of the Chatu Maha Rachika realm (one of the lower levels of Heaven ‚Äì an Asura realm of giants and pretas). His other name is 'Pra Panasabodee', and he is the Lord of the forest and places where wild plants grow. In that time, there was an Asura demon called To Kok Khanak (also known as 'To Anurak'). To Kok Khanak was a good friend of Pu Chao Khao Khiao, who had been attacked by Phra Ram (the hero of Ramakien, Thai version of the Hindu epic Ramayana), who had thrown a Kok tree at him which pierced his chest and carried him through space to be pinned to the side of Pra Sumen. In addition, Pra Ram cursed him with the following magic spell: 'Until your descendants weave a Civara monks robe from lotus petals, and offer it to Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai (Maitreya the future Buddha) your curse will not be lifted.' After this, Nang Prachant, the daughter of Lord Kok Khanag had to serve her father, spending the days and nights trying to weave a Civara robe from lotus petals, in order to have it ready for offering to Pra Sri Ariya Maedtrai who will descend to become enlightened in a future age. Meanwhile, To Kok Khanak had to remain cursed and pinned to Pra Sumen and his daughter was in a dire situation without her father to help run things. Since she had to spend all her time weaving the Civara, she had no time to sell things or make money, nor time to run a shop. When Chao Khao Khiaw heard this, he felt compassion and sent his daughter Nang Kwak to go stay with her. Because of her merit, Nang Kwak caused merchants and rich nobles to flock to Nang Prachant's home and bestow gifts of gold, silver and money on her. Nang Prachant became wealthy and led a comfortable life.Spencer Littlewood, Buddha Magic, Issue 4 Gallery File:Nang Kwak of Koon Ngam Ching Yuen.JPGNang Kwak figurine at Koon Ngam Ching Yuen (Temple), Hong Kong File:Nang Gwak Cha Am.jpgNang Kwak figurine at a shrine in Cha-am File:Wat Phra That Ruang Rong-018.jpgNang Kwak at Wat Phra That Ruang Rong, Sisaket Province ReferencesBibliography *Phya Anuman Rajadhon, Essays on Thai Folklore *Pranee Wongthet, Reconfiguration of the Role of the Guardian Spirit: Reflection from the Phuan Feasting Ritual External links *Brahman Origins of the Thai Mae Nang Kwak Deity *Image Thai goddesses Thai folklore Folk religion Tutelary deities ","title":"Nang Kwak"},{"id":"23781846","text":"Brazilian swimmer C√©sar Cielo wearing the Arena X-Glide swimsuit Arena X-Glide is a swimsuit from the Arena brand, made of pure polyurethane that causes a swimmer to slide through water faster when swimming. One notable example of the efficacy of this suit design is that of Paul Biedermann of Germany who wore the suit in the 2009 World Championships, breaking two world records. The design of the suit covers basically the whole torso and the legs with the impermeable polyurethane, thereby exposing less skin to the water and improving the swimmer's buoyancy and streamlined shape. This significantly reduces the drag a swimmer experiences as he or she moves through the water. Technology According to Rick Sharp, an exercise physiologist at Iowa State University, \\"The Speedo team came up with a design that put panels of polyurethane over parts of the body that produce the highest drag. Another part is the suit design: You don't want a suit that traps water as it flows around the swimmer. Yet another innovation is to use material that squeezes and slims down swimmers \\"so the skin doesn't wobble around as they go through the water.\\" Pieces of fabric were put through wind-tunnel tests to check for drag. Programmers used computational fluid dynamics to model the suits' aerodynamic qualities, as if they were trying to figure out how a brand-new jet will fly. Then, swimmers put the designs to real-world tests in tanks and pools. Following the incredible results the new Speedo LZR Racer swimsuit produced in the Beijing Olympics (Twenty-three world records were broken by the swimmers who wore LZR Racer suits, compared with only two that were broken by the swimmers who didn't. Speedo said 89 percent of all the medals in swimming, including 94 percent of the gold medals were won by LZR Racer swimmers), Italian swimsuit makers Arena and Jaked responded by both developing suits that one-upped the Speedo by using pure polyurethane. Controversy There was a great deal of controversy in the swimming world surrounding polyurethane swimsuits, and strict rules banning these types of swimsuits in professional swimming were put into place. After Biedermann's wins in the 2009 World Championships, Michael Phelps' trainer (until then, Phelps had held the world record for the 200m freestyle since 2007) suggested that Phelps boycott international swimming competitions until the suit is banned. Biedermann's breaking of both Ian Thorpe's 400m world record as well as Phelps's 200m record have been largely attributed to the superiority in the design of his swimsuit. Michael Phelps speculated that the new rules banning polyurethane will level the playing field once more, stating: FINA rule changes Following the December 2008 European Short Course Championships in Croatia, where 17 world records fell, it was felt there was a need to modify the rules surrounding swimsuits. The combined effects of the LZR both compressing the body and trapping air for buoyancy led to many competitors who used the LZR wearing two or more suits for an increased effect. This led to some claiming that the LZR was in effect \\"technological doping.\\" At their meeting in Dubai in March 2009, FINA stipulated that swimsuits should not cover the neck, must not extend past the shoulders and ankles, and also limit the suits' thickness and buoyancy. In a statement FINA stated that: The LZR Racer and all other Speedo Fast Skin Competition Suits were approved. However other suits like the BlueSeventy Nero Comp were banned first and afterwards released, too. In an abrupt reversal of opinion, the FINA Congress voted almost unanimously to revert its previous policy and ban all body-length swimsuits.FINA Opts to Ban All High-Tech Swimsuits , reachforthewall.com, July 24, 2009 The decision was taken in Rome on July 24, 2009, during the 2009 World Aquatics Championships. The new policy states that men's swimsuits may maximally cover the area from the waist to the knee, and women's counterparts from the shoulder to the knee. They also ruled that the fabric used must be a textile (i.e. woven rather than a foil). The new regulations took effect in January 2010. USA Swimming, the United States governing body, made the date where all these suits will be illegal October 1, 2009. FINA has already released an outline of the legal suits to wear. Among the suits on this list there is the Nike Swift, the Speedo FS PRO, and the Speedo LZR.

That is, there is the existence of both private and public facilities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for leading the health sector. The service provision aspect of public healthcare has been devolved to newly created entities, the Regional Health Authorities (RHAs). Responsibility for the provision of healthcare services in Trinidad and Tobago was devolved from the Ministry of Health to Regional Health Authorities under the Regional Health Authorities Act No. 5 in 1994. While the Ministry of Health does not directly run health facilities, it is required to play a key role in ensuring that they are properly run, by setting policies, goals and targets for Regions based on assessment of real health needs. This is the main role of the Ministry of Health. The Ministry also allocates resources to the RHAs to finance their operations. The Ministry of Health is shifting its focus to concentrate on policy development, planning, monitoring and evaluation, regulation, financing and research. Citizens can access free health care at public healthcare facilities where health insurance is not required. However, the government is developing the National Health Service in which a package of services is to be determined, as well as a financing strategy. Public and private Public Healthcare is free to everyone in Trinidad and Tobago and is paid for by the Government and taxpayers. Healthcare services are provided on a walk-in basis. There are a few major hospitals throughout the country as well as smaller health centers and clinics located regionally throughout. Several major hospitals in Trinidad and Tobago are: #Port of Spain General Hospital located in the country's capital of Port of Spain. It is a major trauma centre in the Caribbean. #San Fernando General Hospital located in the City of San Fernando. #San Fernando Teaching Hospital located in the City of San Fernando. #Sangre Grande Hospital located in Sangre Grande, Trinidad. #Point Fortin Hospital #Eric Williams Medical Science Complex located in Champ Fleurs, Trinidad. #Scarborough General Hospital located in Signal Hill, Tobago These hospitals are aided by many DHF'S (District Health Facilities) located throughout the country. Reform The Ministry of Health is mandated to provide a functioning healthcare system to benefit all citizens. This had led to the reforming of the entire healthcare system in the country.

Performance The Devils had its first performance at London's Aldwych Theatre in February, 1961, with Dorothy Tutin portraying the deformed and hysterical Sister Jeanne of the Angels, and Richard Johnson as the existential hero, Father Urbain Grandier. Diana Rigg appeared in the supporting role of Philippe and Max Adrian played the zealot exorcist, Father Pierre Barre (Max Adrian himself would go on to appear in the film version of the play, albeit not as Pierre Barre, but as Ibert, the surgeon).http://www.enotes.com/odp-encyclopedia/devils Whiting revised his text in 1963, shortly before his death from cancer.

It starred Fred Parslow and Joanna McCallum. In 2018, the play was performed at the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, directed by Ben Naylor and Anna Healey.https://bennaylor.me/productions/the-devils/ The story The play's action takes place primarily in Loudun, France in 1634 and revolves around a secular priest Urbain Grandier, whose adamant public opposition to Cardinal Richelieu's ongoing centralization of the French government makes him a hot political target. The hysterical Sister Jeanne, Mother Superior of the Convent of St Ursula, falls in lust with Urbain Grandier, and subsequently accuses him of bewitching her. When these charges of witchcraft are brought against the priest, both church and state move swiftly to destroy him. The investigation, subsequent trial and eventual execution quickly take on a ludicrous carnival- like atmosphere with crazed nuns (including Sister Jeanne herself), dubious medical procedures, ecclesiastical torture and outrageous public exorcisms, all depicted with considerable onstage realism. David Keltz in scene from The Devils, by John Whiting, at the Corner Theatre ETC in 1976. Text and adaptation Readers of both Huxley's book and Whiting's play will note several alterations made for the stage. First, the addition of a Chorus-like character, the Sewerman, who not only provides ironic commentary but assists in the narrative action of the highly episodic play itself. Secondly, the role of Philippe is a composite character, fashioned from two historical figures in Huxley's text: Madeline de Brou and Philippe Trincant, the young and vulnerable daughter of Loudun's Magistrate. Whiting's The Devils also provided ample text, following some adaptation, for Krzysztof Penderecki's opera, The Devils of Loudun (Die Teufel von Loudun). It was also heavily used by British film director Ken Russell in the preparation for the screenplay of his highly controversial film version, The Devils (1971). Russell's film has been banned in several countries and was originally issued an \\"X\\" rating in the United States, despite numerous edits.

A chartered American steamship arrived on scene and assisted the French and British in their attempted suppression of the forts. Background After the First Battle of Taku Forts in 1858, the Xianfeng Emperor appointed the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen to take charge of coastal defense. Sengge Rinchen hailed from a rich lineage- the 26th generation descendant of Qasar, a brother of Genghis Khan. He took to this task with ardor, repairing and improving the coastal defenses in preparation for the British arrival.Zhang, Senggelinqin chuanqi, p. 97 A second, stronger boom was constructed across the river to further restrict the movement of British ships. This second boom was made of full-sized tree trunks, connected with heavy chains. Two rows of ditches were dug in front of the walls, filled with water and mud, and an abatis of iron spikes placed immediately behind it.Platt, Stephen (2012). Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom: China, the West, and the Epic Story of the Taiping Civil War Finally, Sengge Rinchen ensured the Chinese defenders and their cannon were trained and equipped to resist the coming British ships and their landing parties. Battle On the morning of June 25, 1859, the British could see that the Chinese fort's defenses were somewhat improved. However, there did not appear to be many defenders, they did not see the flags and gongs that might indicating an impending battle, and the portholes for the guns were covered in matting. Local informants indicated to them that the fort was manned only by a skeleton crew. Even when, as an experiment, they cut through the first boom, they encountered no resistance. The British then attempted to ram the second boom with their admiral's ship, Plover, as they had successfully done the year before. This time, though, the heavy boom stopped the British gunship cold. George Battye Fisher, Personal Narrative of Three Years' Service in China, pp. 190-193As the advance of the British fleet stalled, the matting was removed from the portholes, revealing the fort's defenders, and the fort's guns opened fire. The first salvo decapitated the Plover's bow gunner. Under heavy fire from the fort, the Plover's hull eventually burst, sinking the ship into the mud and killing all of the ship's crew but one. The rest of the British fleet was similarly devastated- two ships were forced to run around, and two others were sunk in the river by the fort's cannon. Others attempted to retreat as the fort's smaller guns picked off their officers and men from the shore. That evening, when the Chinese fort's guns finally went silent, the British believed the Chinese had at last abandoned the fort, and proceeded to launch their landing parties. However, this turned out to be a ruse to lure the British marines onto the beach.Williams, Life and Letters The landing had been delayed for so long that British landing parties were forced to approach at low tide, hundreds of meters from the Chinese fort's walls. There, the British marines slipped and stuck in the muddy riverbanks, where they were shot to pieces by Chinese gunners. Those British who were able to make it to the trenches found them filled with a mixture of mud and water too thin to walk on and too thick to swim through, soaking their ammunition and further exposing them to fire. As night fell, those who were finally able to reach the fort's walls found themselves trapped under the fort's walls, as the defenders dangled sizzling fireworks on long poles over the edge of the wall to illuminate them to the archers above. One boat managed to gather a handful of the wounded, but it was struck by a well-aimed cannon shot. It broke in half and sank, drowning all on board. Williams, Life and Letters By sunrise the next morning, over four hundred British were dead or wounded, including twenty-nine officers. Chinese casualties were reported to be minimal. Aftermath An American interpreter and missionary named Samuel Wells William wrote that this was possibly the worst defeat the British had suffered since the 1842 retreat from Kabul. One of the battle's survivors declared he would rather relive the 1854 Battle of Balaclava, with its disastrous charge of the Light Brigade, three times rather than experience what they'd just suffered at the hands of Sengge Rinchen at the Taku forts.Williams, Life and Letters Sengge Rinchen rejoiced in his well- earned victory, writing to the Emperor that while the British and their allies might return with more ships, with one or two more victories \\"the pride and vainglory of the barbarians, already under severe trial, will immediately disappear.\\" T.F.

It is locally abundant in a restricted subalpine habitat with a high rainfall, often growing in the ecotone in association with Antarctic Beech.Tasmannia purpurascens habit, in the Barrington Tops National Park  Description  Tasmannia purpurascens usually grows to a height of with a woody stem, purplish new growth and branchlets. The leaves are egg-shaped with a rounded tip, mostly long and wide. They are glabrous with a purplish base, lack a distinct petiole and have a raised midrib on the lower surface. Creamy- white flowers about wide and arranged in umbels appear in November. The flowers are either male or female but occur on the same plant. There are two petals long and female flowers have an ovary about long. Fleshy, purplish- black, oval-shaped berries around long are seen around Easter time. Taxonomy and naming The broad-leaved pepperbush was first formally described in 1937 by Joyce Vickery who gave it the name Drimys purpurascens and published the description in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. In 1969, Albert Smith transferred the species to Tasmannia based on its chromosome number of 13, compared to 43 in most others in Drimys. The specific epithet (purpurascens) is derived from the Latin word purpureus meaning \\"purple\\" with the suffix -escens meaning \\"becoming\\" referring to the reddish-purple base of the midvein. The genus Tasmannia is of interest to scientists as these plants are some of the most primitive of all angiosperms. They have a primitive flowering structure and the wood is similar to that of conifers, in that it lacks vessels. In common with other members of the genus, it is sometimes known as \\"pepperbush\\" because of the spicy fruits and seeds which have been used to flavour food. Distribution and habitat Tasmannia purpurascens grows in forests with Antarctic beech and eucalypt species, at altitudes of . It is abundant in the Ben Halls Gap and Barrington Tops National Parks, growing where it sometimes snows and where frosts are common in winter. Conservation Tasmannia purpurascens was previously listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 but was delisted in 2013. It remains listed as \\"vulnerable\\" in New South Wales.  Use in horticulture  This plant is difficult to propagate from seed but readily propagated from cuttings taken in early autumn. Its slow growth, attractive appearance and resistance to pests make it useful as an indoor plant.

The pack horses stampeded and bolted - they hadn't heard the like before and of course a bolting pack horse soon loses its pack. That was strewn every- where.

He was appointed Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to France on November 24, 2017, having previously served as UAE Ambassador to Russia from 2009-2017. Ghobash authored the book, Letters to a Young Muslim (January 2017), which was written as a series of letters to his eldest son about what it means to be Muslim in the 21st century. Education Between the years 1986‚Äî1989, Ghobash was educated at Rugby School, a boarding independent school for boys in the market town of Rugby in Warwickshire, followed between 1989‚Äî1992 at Balliol College at the University of Oxford, where he gained a B.A. in Law. Between 2003‚Äî2007, he studied BSc. in Pure and Applied Mathematics, in an external programme at the University of London. Life and career Ghobash sponsors the Saif Ghobash Banipal Prize for Arabic Literary Translation, in memory of his father, Saif Ghobash, the UAE's first Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, who was assassinated at Abu Dhabi International Airport in 1977. Likewise, he is a founding trustee of the International Prize for Arabic Fiction which runs with the support of the Booker Prize Foundation in London. He founded one of the region's first contemporary art galleries, The Third Line, which is based in Dubai as well as The Arab Fund for Arts and Culture which supports and identifies the production, research, and distribution channels of contemporary Arab art and culture. Ghobash is on the advisory body of The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence at King's College London and the Emirates Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi. Prior to his appointment as Ambassador, the UAE did not have a diplomatic mission in Moscow for many years. More recently, however, the UAE has invested roughly $6 billion USD in Russia's infrastructure. Ghobash believes Russia's participation in fighting extremism is integral to creating stability in the region. A delegation from Abu Dhabi led by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, has bolstered its presence at The Kremlin in 2015 to coproduce solutions to counter terrorism and conflicts in the Middle East. He is considered by many to be a thought leader on moderate Islam and the future of the Arab world, often calling for change through technological innovation and education in Arab countries. Regarding extremism in young Muslims, he said, ‚ÄúThe key challenge for us is to stop treating our youth with distance, because there are recruiters out there making sure to grab those youth from us.‚Äù After receiving funding from the government of Abu Dhabi, Ghobash was involved in 2008 in discussions with John Sexton on the opening of a campus of New York University in Abu Dhabi in 2010. Ghobash is an avid hiker, once spending five years climbing the mountains of Nepal and Switzerland. He speaks Arabic, English, Russian, French, Italian and Spanish.

The series features events in Arizona, California, Nevada, Missouri and host a weekend of racing in Ensenada, Mexico at Baja International Short Course near Estero Beach. The title sponsor for the series is Lucas Oil Products, whom also own, sanction, and operate the series. It effectively replaced the CORR series starting in 2009. History There were two large sanctioning bodies in short course off-road racing for 2008: CORR and WSORR. CORR had been sanctioning events on the West Coast and WSORR had sanctioned Midwestern events. CORR closed before the end of the 2008 season and canceled its final two racing weekends. LOORRS took over the sanctioning of most of the West Coast events; and TORC, The Off Road Championship, took over most of the Midwestern events. The LOORRS series was founded for the 2009 season by Lucas Oil and its head Forrest Lucas. Carl Renezeder made short course off-road racing history in 2009 when he won the Unlimited 2 and Unlimited 4 class to become the first driver to win seven national championships. In December 2012, LOORRS announced that Ritchie Lewis would be taking over as the series' director. He announced the 2013 series schedule; it would continue racing at most of the same tracks. He also announced that Lucas would be building tracks at San Angelo, Texas and Lucas Oil Speedway to be used in 2014. In December of 2018, the series announced plans to create a historic and long awaited short course unification race to take place in June of 2019 at Lucas Oil Speedway. Regular LOORRS Racers competing against the Lucas Oil Midwest Short Course League Racers with drivers from each series would be able to win points for their respective championships. Unfortunately an untimely tornado wreaked havoc in the area and severely damaged the track forcing official to cancel the event.

Gudesteus or Gudesteo (died 1008x12) was the tenth Bishop of Oviedo. He served as an auxiliary bishop to Bishop Bermudo, perhaps by then old and physically weak, from at least 978 and succeeded him as sole bishop on his death, probably in 992. On folio 49 of the Libro g√≥tico de los testamentos of Oviedo, Bermudo and Gudesteus appear beside each in a miniature illustration. Gudesteus was an Asturian by birth and his parents had left him properties in Lena. Gudesteus's first recorded action as auxiliary bishop was to witness a charter on 10 July 978, with Bermudo not present. On 24 April 984 he calls himself Ouetensis sedis episcopo (\\"bishop of the see of Oviedo\\"), again with no reference to Bermudo, though the senior bishop confirmed many other documents in the 980s. A document of 29 July 991 by which King Bermudo II donated a village in Asturias to Bishop Savaric of Le√≥n, signed only by Gudesteus and not Bermudo, may indicate that by then the latter had retired fully. He would have to have come out of retirement on 2 September 992, when both he and Gudesteus signed the same document as bishops of Oviedo. This may be related to the enmity which Bishop Pelagius reported in his Chronicon regum Legionensium over a century later between Gudesteus and Bermudo II, who was opposed more generally by the Asturians and Leonese and was consequently forced to seek his coronation in Galicia. The act of 2 September 992, Bermudo's last recorded, was the confirmation of the royal will in Le√≥n. In it Bermudo II confirmed all Oviedo's possessions and privileges and all the gifts and concessions which he had made to it. In 992 a certain Gudesteus became Bishop of Burgos and it becomes impossible to know for certain whether certain documentary references to a \\"Bishop Gudesteus\\", as in a witness list to a donation of 9 April 992, belong to the bishop of Burgos or of Oviedo. Nonetheless a document of 18 August that year is accepted as Gudesteus of Oviedo's. There survives from February 993 the foundation stone for a church consecrated by Gudesteus. Gudesteus appears regularly in documents of Bermudo II's reign between 993 and October 996, but after that and until October 999 he does not appear at all. This too may be related to the reported enmity between the \\"indiscrete and tyrannical\\" Bermudo II and Gudesteus. According to Pelagius, Bermudo incarcerated Gudesteus in the Galician castle at Prima de Reyna (or Pe√±a de la Reina) for three years. This injustice was followed by severe drought and famine. This, and a vision received by certain godly men, convinced Bermudo to send envoys to Bishop Jimeno of Astorga, who had been administering Oviedo in the meanwhile, asking him to restore Gudesteus.Henrique Fl√≥rez (ed.), Espa√±a sagrada, xiv, 466‚Äì67. If this account is accurate (Pelagius has been called the \\"prince of falsifiers\\", not for his chronicle but for his forgeries),The phrase \\"prince of falsifiers\\", cited in Simon Barton and Richard A. Fletcher (2000), The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest (Manchester: Manchester University Press), p. 70, was coined by Peter A. Linehan (1982), \\"Religion, Nationalism and National Identity in Medieval Spain and Portugal,\\" Religion and National Identity, ed. S. Mews, Studies in Church History, 18 (Oxford: Oxford University Press), 161‚Äì99, at p. 162. For doubts about Pelagius' accuracy and motives in reporting on Gudesteus and Bermudo, see Carlos de Ayala Mart√≠nez (2008), Sacerdocio y reino en la Espa√±a altomedieval (Silex Ediciones), p. 239. then Gudesteus's restoration must have occurred shortly before Bermudo's death in 999, probably in early September. Gudesteus took part in the coronation of Alfonso V and Elvira in September, where he spoke the words Sub Imperio opificis rerum Gudesteo universalis Oveto episcopus, confirming the accession. Gudesteus appears in a charter of 13 October, his first in three years. On 10 March 1000 Gudesteus again employed the unusual formula universalis Ecclesiae Oveto episcopus (\\"universal bishop of the church of Oviedo\\") in confirming the concession by Salvato of the village of Morella to the monastery of San Cipriano. His importance in the realm under Alfonso V is also evident in his position in witness lists. On 18 May 1000 he signed immediately after the king and queen and on 18 December the church Oviedo received a royal donation. This last act is preserved in the Libro g√≥tico de los testamentos, where only Gudesteus confirms it, but in a later copy it is confirmed by Gudesteus and his successor, Adegani, both as bishops of Oviedo immediately after the king and queen. The properties which Alfonso donated were originally confiscated from a certain Analso Garvixo, who had tried to assassinate Alfonso when he was a child. In the donation Alfonso refers to vobis patri nostro Gudesteo episcopo (\\"you, our father, bishop Gudesteus\\"). Probably Adegani was an auxiliary bishop appointed due to Gudesteus's advanced age. The final years of Gudesteus's episcopate are illuminated by the copies of archival documents made by Vigil for his Asturias monumental y epigr√°fica. He finds documents confirmed by Gudesteus for 11 March and 29 August 1006 and for others of 1008 and 1011. By the 29 August charter, Velasquita, widow of Bermudo II, made a large donation which was witnessed first by a certain Ponce, who signs as archiepiscopo (archbishop). Gudesteus, Dei gratia episcopus (bishop by the grace of god), signs later in the list. Historian Manuel Risco believed Ponce to be another auxiliary bishop and coadjutor of Gudesteus. Risco also found Gudesteus's confirming a document of 1 February 1007 in which Alfonso V and his uncle, Menendo Gonz√°lez, Count of Portugal, gave a sentence in favour of the monastery of Celanova. On 10 July 1008 Gudesteus made his testament, whereby he gave to the church of Oviedo the property he owned in Lena. Antonio Palomeque Torres reckoned 1008 to be his last year, and Carlos Gonz√°lez de Posada believed his successor, Adegani, commenced his episcopate in 1009, but places Gudesteus's death in 1012.

He was born near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on his family's farm, remaining there until his late 20s when he decided to move to Western Canada. He arrived in Regina in 1891 and settled there permanently after returning to PEI to marry. He partnered with fellow islander Pople Balderson to raise livestock on a farm outside of Regina. Later, the two men purchased a butcher's shop in town and were soon able to obtain contracts with residential schools and the North West Mounted Police. Darke invested his earnings to purchase several blocks of land in town from the Canadian Pacific Railway. His real estate holdings were profitable enough to allow him to sell his cattle business in order to focus on land development. He was elected to town council in 1895 and served as mayor in 1898 at the age of 35 and remains Regina's youngest ever mayor. Darke was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1925 federal election as a Liberal MP for Regina electoral district but resigned his seat in early 1926 in order to allow Saskatchewan Premier Charles Avery Dunning to enter the federal parliament in a by-election after he was appointed Finance Minister in the federal cabinet. Darke donated $85,000 and raised a further $40,000 to help establish Regina College in 1910. The college eventually became the University of Regina. He also donated money in 1929 to build the Darke Hall for Music and Art which served as the home of the Regina Symphony Orchestra for 41 years.

In 1862 he became a second lieutenant and progressed in rank to first lieutenant, captain, then a brevet major of volunteers due to gallantry. He later served his community and Philadelphia with honor as a business lawyer of high respect. Early life James Carpenter was the second eldest son of eight children born to Edward Carpenter 2nd and Anna Maria (Mary) Howey.Carpenters' Encyclopedia of Carpenters 2009 (DVD format), Subject is RIN 4293; work contains updates to the 1912 book on \\"Samuel Carpenter and his Descendants.\\" He was born in Chesterfield, Kent County, Maryland and in 1843 his family moved to Philadelphia where they attended Trinity Episcopal Church in West Philadelphia.Trinity Episcopal Church, West Philadelphia, is now where the Mario Lanza Park is located. The Church once stood west of Second Street, between Catharine and Queen streets. This Church was consecrated in 1822, closed in 1908 and razed by 1917 with the new park \\"Queen Park\\" open in late 1918. The park was renamed on September 29, 1967 in memory of Mario Lanza (1921‚Äì1959) one of Philadelphia's most beloved signers and film stars. See: \\"Then and Now Trinity Episcopal Church\\" at: Civil War In 1861, he enlisted as a private the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and in 1862 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant. During the night of September 17/18, 1862, he was wounded seriously inside the elbow in the engagement at Philomont, Virginia, on the advance at the end of the fighting at the Battle of Antietam. In the early evening of May 2, 1863, he was part of the heroic, but ultimately futile, charge of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry against Confederate General Jackson's Corp flanking attack during the Battle of Chancellorsville. His horse was shot from under him and, of the five officers who rode at the head of the attacking column, he was one of only two who survived. This charge only marginally slowed down the collapse of the right flank of the Union Army Major General Joseph Hooker's Army of the Potomac. Hooker had only left a token force of cavalry with his main attack thinking they would not be needed in the woods. Hooker had sent 7,500 cavalry troopers with Major General George Stoneman to raid behind the Confederate line into their supply and communications. Stoneman's Raid, as it became known, ultimately failed in its main quest, but was a confidence builder for the Union cavalry.Sears, Stephen W., Chancellorsville, Houghton Mifflin, 1996, On June 29, 1863, he was selected and served on the staff of Brigadier General D. McMurtrie Gregg, who was just given the command of the Second Cavalry Division, Cavalry Corps, under the reorganization by Major General George G. Meade. Brevet Major Carpenter for the next eighteen months excelled in this position, providing good documentation and order. Post Civil War In early 1865, he was honorably discharged at the expiration of his term of service and returned to Philadelphia. He resumed the study of law in the office of Theodore Cuyler, Esq. (1819‚Äì1876). In October 1865 he was admitted to the bar in Philadelphia.Surname Guide - Thomas Carpenter Genealogy, accessed July 29, 2009 at: http://www.surnameguide.com/carpenter/thomas_carpenter_genealogy.htm As a lawyer he assisted in helping to establish the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States in Philadelphia during May 1865. Later he became a companion of that order when the concern of conflict of interest was lifted. Family On October 17, 1867, in Philadelphia, he wed Harriet Odin Dorr (22 Jul 1842 ‚Äì 24 Jan 1896). She was the daughter of Reverend Benjamin Dorr and Esther K. Odin, both of Massachusetts. James & Harriet were wed by the Rector of Christ's Church, her father. She was a descendant of Edward Dorr, who was the first of that name in America. He immigrated to New England about 1670, from the west of England, where families of the surname Dorr have long been settled in Dorsetshire. They had the following children born in Philadelphia:Samuel Carpenter and his Descendants ‚Äì see pages 128 & 129 that document the Dorr family. * Edward Carpenter IV, born August 27, 1872.

It supports a choir, youth choir, youth training choir, children's choir and a youth orchestra, and releases its recordings on its own record label, though it has occasionally released recordings on Angel Records and EMI. Since 1996 the orchestra has been resident at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester. History In May 1857 the pianist and conductor Charles Hall√© set up an orchestra to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition, which it did until October. Hall√© decided to continue working with the orchestra as a formal organisation, and it gave its first concert under those auspices on 30 January 1858. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england- merseyside-17041169 The orchestra's first home was the Free Trade Hall. By 1861 the orchestra was in financial trouble, and it performed only two concerts that year. In 1888 German violinist Willy Hess become leader of The Hall√©, a role he held until 1895. From its opening in 1893 he was also the principal professor of violin at the Royal Manchester College of Music. The Hall√©'s first programme (1858)Hans Richter served as music director from 1899 to 1911. During his tenure, the orchestra gave the first performance of the Symphony No. 1 of Sir Edward Elgar. In 1943 the orchestra was again in crisis, having diminished in size to 30 players. Over the next 27 years, from 1943 to 1970, the orchestra's next music director, Sir John Barbirolli, restored the Hall√© to national prominence. Together, they made many recordings, including the first recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams' Symphony No. 8, of which they also gave the first performance. During Barbirolli's tenure, one of the most notable orchestra members was concertmaster Martin Milner, who served in that capacity from 1958 to 1987. Barbirolli regarded Milner as his \\"right-hand man\\" and once wrote in appreciation to him: \\"You are the finest leader I have ever had in my fairly long career.\\" Kent Nagano was principal conductor of the orchestra from 1992 to 1999. The orchestra moved from the Free Trade Hall to the Bridgewater Hall in 1996 as its primary concert venue. During his tenure, Nagano received criticism for his expensive and ambitious programming, as well as his conducting fees. However, poor financial management at the orchestra separately contributed to the fiscal troubles of the orchestra. The orchestra faced major financial problems during the late 1990s, including a ¬£1.3 million deficit in 1998, to the point where the existence of the orchestra was threatened with loss of funding from the Arts Council and ultimately bankruptcy. The Hall√© performing at Jodrell Bank Observatory. During 1997 there was an eight-month period when the orchestra had no executive director. Leslie Robinson served for two years as chief executive after that period, starting changes to the orchestra to start to bring under control the orchestra's financial troubles. These included public fund-raising, which netted ¬£2 million, cutting the number of people on the orchestra board in half, and reducing the number of musicians in the orchestra from 98 to 80. Since 1999, the orchestra's chief executive has been John Summers, who continued Robinson's fiscal practices to restore greater financial security to the orchestra. In 2001, the Arts Council awarded the orchestra a ¬£3.8 million grant to allow it to pay off accumulated debts and increase musician salaries, which had been frozen for 4 years. In September 2000 Sir Mark Elder took up the position of music director, having been appointed to the post in 1999. His concerts with the orchestra have received consistently positive reviews, and he is generally regarded as having restored the orchestra to high critical and musical standards. In 2004 Elder signed a contract to extend his tenure through 2010, and in May 2009 the Hall√© announced a further extension to 2015.Martin Cullingford, \\"Elder renews Hall√© contract until 2015\\". Gramophone, 15 May 2009. In November 2013, the Hall√© announced the further extension of Elder's contract through \\"at least 2020\\". One of the orchestra's recent ideas was to try to find alternative stage dress to the traditional \\"penguin suits\\", but this idea did not come to fruition. The orchestra has also begun to issue new CD recordings under its own label. In 2017, the orchestra began a series of recordings in collaboration with the film composer, Benson Taylor. In March 2006 the orchestra was forced to cancel a planned tour of the United States because of the cost and administrative difficulties in obtaining visas for the musicians, a result of the tougher visa regulations intended to combat potential terrorist attacks. The orchestra appointed its first-ever principal guest conductor, Cristian Mandeal, in 2006. He served in this post until 2009. In February 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of Markus Stenz as its second and next principal guest conductor, starting in 2009. Past assistant conductors have included Edward Gardner, Rory Macdonald, Andrew Gourlay, and Ewa Strusi≈Ñska (2008‚Äì2010), the first female conductor named to a UK assistant conductorship. In September 2016, Jonathon Heyward became the Hall√©'s new assistant conductor, whose duties include musical direction of the Hall√© Youth Orchestra.

In 1928, it was adopted as the first international measurement quantity for ionising radiation to be defined for radiation protection, as it was then the most easily replicated method of measuring air ionization by using ion chambers.Princeton radiation safety guide, appendix E (accessed 2014). It is named after the German physicist Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, who discovered X-rays. However, although this was a major step forward in standardising radiation measurement, the roentgen has the disadvantage that it is only a measure of air ionisation, and not a direct measure of radiation absorption in other materials, such as different forms of human tissue. For instance, one roentgen deposits of absorbed dose in dry air, or in soft tissue. One roentgen of X-rays may deposit anywhere from in bone depending on the beam energy. As the science of radiation dosimetry developed, it was realised that the ionising effect, and hence tissue damage, was linked to the energy absorbed, not just radiation exposure. Consequently new radiometric units for radiation protection were defined which took this into account. In 1953 the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) recommended the rad, equal to 100 erg/g, as the unit of measure of the new radiation quantity absorbed dose. The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units. In 1975 the unit gray was named as the SI unit of absorbed dose. One gray is equal to 1 J/kg (i.e. 100 rad). Additionally, a new quantity, Kerma, was defined for air ionisation as the exposure quantity for instrument calibration, and from this the absorbed dose can be calculated using known coefficients for specific target materials. Today, for radiation protection, the modern units, absorbed dose for energy absorption and the equivalent dose (sievert) for stochastic effect, are overwhelmingly used, and the roentgen is rarely used. The International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) has never accepted the use of the roentgen. The roentgen has been metrologically redefined over the years. It was last defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1998 as , with a recommendation that the definition be given in every document where the roentgen is used.  History  The roentgen has its roots in the Villard unit defined in 1908 by the American Roentgen Ray Society as \\"the quantity of radiation which liberates by ionisation one esu of electricity per cm3 of air under normal conditions of temperature and pressure.\\"Van Loon, R.; and Van Tiggelen, R., Radiation Dosimetry in Medical Exposure: A Short Historical Overview , 2004> Using 1 esu ‚âà 3.33564 C and the air density of ~1.293 kg/m¬≥ at 0 ¬∞C and 101 kPa, this converts to 2.58 √ó 10‚àí4 C/kg, which is the modern value given by NIST. 1 √ó 3.33564 √ó 10‚àí10 √ó 1,000,000 √∑ 1.293 = 2.58 √ó 10‚àí4 This definition was used under different names (e, R, and German unit of radiation) for the next 20 years. In the meantime, the French Roentgen was given a different definition which amounted to 0.444 German R. =ICR definitions= In 1928, the International Congress of Radiology (ICR) defined the roentgen as \\"the quantity of X-radiation which, when the secondary electrons are fully utilised and the wall effect of the chamber is avoided, produce in 1 cc of atmospheric air at 0 ¬∞C and 76 cm of mercury pressure such a degree of conductivity that 1 esu of charge is measured at saturation current.\\" The stated 1 cc of air would have a mass of 1.293 mg at the conditions given, so in 1937 the ICR rewrote this definition in terms of this mass of air instead of volume, temperature and pressure. The 1937 definition was also extended to gamma rays, but later capped at 3 MeV in 1950. =GOST definition= The USSR all-union committee of standards (GOST) had meanwhile adopted a significantly different definition of the roentgen in 1934. GOST standard 7623 defined it as \\"the physical dose of X-rays which produces charges each of one electrostatic unit in magnitude per cm3 of irradiated volume in air at 0 ¬∞C and normal atmospheric pressure when ionization is complete.\\" The distinction of physical dose from dose caused confusion, some of which may have led Cantrill and Parker report that the roentgen had become shorthand for 83 ergs per gram (0.0083 Gy) of tissue. They named this derivative quantity the roentgen equivalent physical (rep) to distinguish it from the ICR roentgen. =ICRP definition= The introduction of the roentgen measurement unit, which relied upon measuring the ionisation of air, replaced earlier less accurate practices that relied on timed exposure, film exposure, or fluorescence.Mutscheller, A. (1925). Physical standards of protection against Roentgen ray dangers, AJR. American Journal of Roentgenology, 13, 65‚Äì69. This led the way to setting exposure limits, and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements of the United States established the first formal dose limit in 1931 as 0.1 roentgen per day. The International X-ray and Radium Protection Committee, now known as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) soon followed with a limit of 0.2 roentgen per day in 1934. In 1950, the ICRP reduced their recommended limit to 0.3 roentgen per week for whole-body exposure. The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) took over the definition of the roentgen in 1950, defining it as \\"the quantity of X or Œ≥-radiation such that the associated corpuscular emission per 0.001293 gram of air produces, in air, ions carrying 1 electrostatic unit of quantity of electricity of either sign.\\" The 3 MeV cap was no longer part of the definition, but the degraded usefulness of this unit at high beam energies was mentioned in the accompanying text. In the meantime, the new concept of roentgen equivalent man (rem) had been developed. Starting in 1957, the ICRP began to publish their recommendations in terms of rem, and the roentgen fell into disuse. The medical imaging community still has a need for ionization measurements, but they gradually converted to using C/kg as legacy equipment was replaced. The ICRU recommended redefining the roentgen to be exactly 2.58 √ó 10‚àí4 C/kg in 1971.ICRU Report 19, 1971 =European Union= In 1971 the European Economic Community, in Directive 71/354/EEC, catalogued the units of measure that could be used \\"for ... public health ... purposes\\". The directive included the curie, rad, rem and roentgen as permissible units, but required that the use of the rad, rem and roentgen be reviewed before 31 December 1977. This document defined the roentgen as exactly 2.58 √ó 10‚àí4 C/kg, as per the ICRU recommendation. Directive 80/181/EEC, published in December 1979, which replaced directive 71/354/EEC, explicitly catalogued the gray, becquerel and sievert for this purpose and required that the curie, rad, rem and roentgen be phased out by 31 December 1985. =NIST definition= Today the roentgen is rarely used, and the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) never accepted the use of the roentgen. From 1977 to 1998, the US NIST's translations of the SI brochure stated that the CIPM temporarily accepted the use of the roentgen (and other radiology units) with SI units since 1969. However, the only related CIPM decision shown in the appendix are with regards to the curie in 1964. The NIST brochures defined the roentgen as 2.58 √ó 10‚àí4 C/kg, to be employed with exposures of x or Œ≥ radiation, but did not state the medium to be ionized. The CIPM's current SI brochure excludes the roentgen from the tables of non-SI units accepted for use with the SI. The US NIST clarified in 1998 that it was providing its own interpretations of the SI system, whereby it accepted the roentgen for use in the US with the SI, while recognizing that the CIPM did not. By then, the limitation to x and Œ≥ radiation had been dropped. NIST recommends defining the roentgen in every document where this unit is used. The continued use of the roentgen is strongly discouraged by the NIST. Development of replacement radiometric quantities External modern radiation quantities used in radiological protection Whilst a convenient quantity to measure with an air ion chamber, the rontgen had the disadvantage that it was not a direct measure of either the intensity of X-rays or their absorption, but rather was a measurement of the ionising effect of X-rays in a specific circumstance; which was dry air at 0 ¬∞C and 1 standard atmosphere of pressure. Because of this the roentgen had a variable relationship to the amount of energy absorbed dose per unit mass in the target material, as different materials have different absorption characteristics. As the science of radiation dosimetry developed, this was seen as a serious shortcoming. In 1940, Louis Harold Gray, who had been studying the effect of neutron damage on human tissue, together with William Valentine Mayneord and the radiobiologist John Read, published a paper in which a unit of measure, dubbed the \\"gram roentgen\\" (symbol: gr) defined as \\"that amount of neutron radiation which produces an increment in energy in unit volume of tissue equal to the increment of energy produced in unit volume of water by one roentgen of radiation\\" was proposed. This unit was found to be equivalent to 88 ergs in air. In 1953 the ICRU recommended the rad, equal to 100 erg/g, as the new unit of measure of absorbed radiation. The rad was expressed in coherent cgs units.Guill, JH; Moteff, John (June 1960). \\"Dosimetry in Europe and the USSR\\". Third Pacific Area Meeting Papers ‚Äî Materials in Nuclear Applications. Symposium on Radiation Effects and Dosimetry - Third Pacific Area Meeting American Society for Testing Materials, October 1959, San Francisco, 12‚Äì16 October 1959. American Society Technical Publication. 276. ASTM International. p. 64. LCCN 60014734. Retrieved 2012-05-15. In the late 1950s the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) invited the ICRU to join other scientific bodies to work with the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in the development of a system of units that could be used consistently over many disciplines. This body, initially known as the \\"Commission for the System of Units\\", renamed in 1964 as the \\"Consultative Committee for Units\\" (CCU), was responsible for overseeing the development of the International System of Units (SI). At the same time it was becoming increasingly obvious that the definition of the roentgen was unsound, and in 1962 it was redefined. The CCU decided to define the SI unit of absorbed radiation in terms of energy per unit mass, which in MKS units was J/kg. This was confirmed in 1975 by the 15th CGPM, and the unit was named the \\"gray\\" in honour of Louis Harold Gray, who had died in 1965. The gray was equal to 100 rad. The definition of the roentgen had had the attraction of being relatively simple to define for photons in air, but the gray is independent of the primary ionizing radiation type, and can be used for both kerma and absorbed dose in a wide range of matter. When measuring absorbed dose in a human due to external exposure, the SI unit the gray, or the related non-SI rad are used.

The picture is the only theatrically released feature film in the M*A*S*H franchise, and it became one of the biggest films of the early 1970s for 20th Century Fox. The film depicts a unit of medical personnel stationed at a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) during the Korean War. It stars Donald Sutherland, Tom Skerritt, and Elliott Gould, with Sally Kellerman, Robert Duvall, Ren√© Auberjonois, Gary Burghoff, Roger Bowen, Michael Murphy, and in his film debut, professional football player Fred Williamson. Although the Korean War is the film's storyline setting, the subtext is the Vietnam War ‚Äî a current event at the time the film was made. Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau, who saw the film in college, said M*A*S*H was \\"perfect for the times, the cacophony of American culture was brilliantly reproduced onscreen.\\" The film won Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, later named Palme d'Or, at 1970 Cannes Film Festival. The film went on to receive five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and won for Best Adapted Screenplay. M*A*S*H was deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. The Academy Film Archive preserved M*A*S*H in 2000. The film inspired the television series M*A*S*H, which ran from 1972 to 1983. Gary Burghoff, who played Radar O'Reilly, was the only actor playing a major character who was retained for the series. Plot In 1951, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital in South Korea is assigned two new surgeons, \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Army Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. Other characters already stationed at the camp include bumbling commanding officer Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, dentist Walter \\"Painless Pole\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions. Irritated by Burns' religious fervor, Hawkeye and Duke get Blake to move him to another tent so newly arrived chest surgeon Trapper John McIntyre can move in. The three doctors (the \\"Swampmen\\", after the nickname for their tent) have little respect for military protocol, having been drafted into the Army, and are prone to pranks, womanizing, and heavy drinking. Burns is a straitlaced military officer who wants everything done efficiently and by the book, as is Margaret Houlihan, who has been assigned to the 4077th as head nurse. The two bond over their respect for regulations and start a secret romance. With help from Radar, the Swampmen sneak a microphone into a tent where the couple are making love and broadcast their passion over the camp's PA system, embarrassing them badly. The next morning, Hawkeye goads Burns into assaulting him, resulting in Burns' removal from the camp for psychiatric evaluation. Later, when Houlihan is showering, the Swampmen prank her by pulling the curtains off, exposing her naked body. Houlihan is furious, and complains to Blake about it, saying that the 4077th is an \\"insane asylum\\", and blames it on him. Painless, described variously as \\"the best-equipped dentist in the Army\\" and \\"the dental Don Juan of Detroit\\", becomes depressed over an incident of impotence and announces his intent to commit suicide, believing that he has turned homosexual. The Swampmen agree to help him carry out the deed, staging a feast reminiscent of the Last Supper, arranging for Father Mulcahy to give Painless the last rites, and providing him with a \\"black capsule\\" (actually a sleeping pill) to speed him on his way. Hawkeye persuades the gorgeous Lieutenant \\"Dish\\" Schneider, who is being transferred back to the United States for discharge, to spend the night with Painless to allay his concern over his sexual preference. The next morning, Painless is his usual cheerful self, and a smiling Dish leaves camp in a helicopter to start her journey home. Trapper and Hawkeye are sent to Japan on temporary duty to operate on a Congressman's son. When they later perform an unauthorized operation on a local infant, they face disciplinary action from the hospital commander for misusing Army resources. Using staged photographs of him in bed with a prostitute, they blackmail him into keeping his mouth shut. Following their return to camp, Blake and General Hammond organize a game of football between the 4077th and the 325th Evac Hospital and wager several thousand dollars on its outcome. At Hawkeye's suggestion, Blake applies to have a specific neurosurgeon ‚Äì Dr. Oliver Harmon \\"Spearchucker\\" Jones, a former professional football player for the San Francisco 49ers ‚Äì transferred to the 4077th as a ringer. Blake bets half his money up front, keeping Jones out of the first half of the game. The 325th scores repeatedly and easily, even after the 4077th drugs one of their star players to incapacitate him, and Hammond confidently offers high odds against which Blake bets the rest of his money. Jones enters the second half, which quickly devolves into a free-for-all, and the 4077th gets the 325th's second ringer thrown out of the game and wins with a final trick play. Not long after the football game, Hawkeye and Duke get their discharge orders and begin their journey home ‚Äì taking the same stolen Jeep in which they arrived. CastProduction=Development and writing= The screenplay, by Ring Lardner, Jr., is different from Hooker's original novel. In the DVD audio commentary, Altman describes the novel as \\"pretty terrible\\" and somewhat \\"racist\\" (the only major black character has the nickname \\"Spearchucker\\"). He claims that the screenplay was used only as a springboard. Despite this assertion by Altman, however, while some improvisation occurs in the film and Altman changed the order of major sequence, most sequences are in the novel. The main deletion is a subplot of Ho-Jon's return to the 4077th as a casualty (when Radar steals blood from Henry, it is for Ho-Jon's operation under Trapper and Hawkeye's scalpels; when the surgeons are playing poker after the football game, they are resolutely ignoring Ho-Jon's corpse being driven away). The main deviation from the script is the trimming of much of the dialogue. In his director's commentary, Altman says that M*A*S*H was the first major studio film to use the word \\"fuck\\" in its dialogue.Altman, Robert M*A*S*H Collector's Edition (Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment), \\"Director's Commentary\\" track. ASIN No. B000BZISTE. Released February 7, 2006. The word is spoken during the football game near the end of the film by Walt \\"Painless Pole\\" Kosciuszko when he says to an opposing football player, \\"All right, Bud, your fucking head is coming right off!\\" The actor, John Schuck, said in an interview that Andy Sidaris, who was handling the football sequences, encouraged Schuck to \\"say something that'll annoy him.\\" Schuck did so, and that particular statement made it into the film without a second thought. Other sources, however, attribute the first audible use of the word fuck as part of the dialogue in the 1967 movie Ulysses. A number of sources state that Lardner was very upset with the liberties taken with his script,Fishman, Howard. \\"Culture Desk\\" What 'M*A*S*H' Taught Us,\\" The New Yorker (July 24, 2018): \\"All of this so infuriated Lardner that he ultimately told the director, 'You‚Äôve ruined my film,' and announced at the movie's first screening that there was not one word of his that remained in it.\\" although Lardner denied this in his autobiography. (Lardner eventually was given the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for his work on the film.) =Filming and production= Altman, relatively new to the filmmaking establishment at that time, lacked the credentials to justify his unorthodox filmmaking process and had a history of turning down work rather than creating a poor-quality product. Altman: \\"I had practice working for people who don't care about quality, and I learned how to sneak it in.\\"Film Curator, North Carolina Museum of Art. \\"M*A*S*H (1970)\\" (Raleigh, North Carolina, 2001). Accessed Jan. 12, 2020. ‚ÄúTwentieth Century Fox had two other wars going on, ‚ÄòPatton‚Äô and ‚ÄòTora! Tora! Tora!‚Äô‚Äù Altman remembered. ‚ÄúThose were big-budget pictures, and we were cheap. I knew that if I stayed under budget and didn‚Äôt cause too much trouble, we could sneak through.‚Äù The filming process was difficult because of tensions between the director and his cast. During principal photography, Sutherland and Gould allegedly spent a third of their time trying to get Altman fired, although this has been disputed.Prigge, Matt. \\"Elliott Gould talks Robert Altman and says he never tried to get him fired,\\" Metro: Entertainment (August 4, 2014). . Altman later commented that if he had known about Gould and Sutherland's protests, he would have resigned. Gould later sent a letter of apology, and Altman used him in a number of his later works ‚Äî including The Long Goodbye, California Split, Nashville, and The Player ‚Äî but Altman never worked with Sutherland again. Because of the context of the film being made ‚Äî during the height of America's involvement in the Vietnam War ‚Äî 20th Century Fox was concerned that audiences would not understand that it was ostensibly taking place during the Korean War. At the request of the studio, a caption that mentions the Korean setting was added to the beginning of the film, and PA announcements throughout the film served the same purpose. Only a few loudspeaker announcements were used in the original cut. When Altman realized he needed more structure to his largely episodic film, editor Danford Greene suggested using more loudspeaker announcements to frame different episodes of the story. Greene took a second- unit crew and filmed additional shots of the speakers. On the same night these scenes were shot, American astronauts landed on the moon.\\"Enlisted: The Story of M*A*S*H\\" (making-of documentary), Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, 2001. The Korean War is explicitly referenced in announcements on the camp public address system and during a radio announcement that plays while Hawkeye and Trapper are putting in Col. Merrill's office, which also cites the film as taking place in 1951. Music=Soundtrack music= Johnny Mandel composed incidental music used throughout the film. Also heard on the soundtrack are Japanese vocal renditions of such songs as \\"Tokyo Shoe Shine Boy\\", \\"My Blue Heaven\\", \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\", \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\", and \\"Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo\\"; impromptu performances of \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\", \\"When the Lights Go On Again\\", and \\"Hail to the Chief\\" by cast members; and the instrumental \\"Washington Post March\\" during the climactic football game. M*A*S*H features the song \\"Suicide Is Painless\\", with music by Mandel and lyrics by Mike Altman, the director's then 14-year-old son. The version heard under the opening credits was sung by uncredited session vocalists John Bahler, Tom Bahler, Ron Hicklin, and Ian Freebairn-Smith; on the single release, the song is attributed to \\"The Mash\\". The song is reprised later in the film by Pvt. Seidman (played by Ken Prymus) in the scene in which Painless attempts to commit suicide. =Soundtrack album= Columbia Records issued a soundtrack album for the film in 1970 (all songs by Johnny Mandel unless otherwise noted): # \\"Suicide Is Painless (Michael Altman, lyrics and Johnny Mandel, music)\\" # \\"Duke and Hawkeye Arrive at M.A.S.H.\\" # \\"The Operating Theater\\" / \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" # \\"Major Houlihan and Major Burns\\" # \\"Painless Suicide, Funeral and Resurrection\\" # \\"'Hot Lips' Shows Her True Colors\\" / \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" # \\"Moments to Remember\\" / \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" # \\"The Football Game\\" # \\"Going Home\\" / \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" # \\"M.A.S.H.

This 1977 release of the film was the original, unedited version and was one of the first 50 titles released to home video by Magnetic Video Corporation (M*A*S*H was number #38). In the 1990s, Fox Video re-released a VHS version of the film under their \\"Selections\\" banner which ran 116 minutes and was rated PG. However, this is not the alternate PG version which was released in 1973. It has the same run- time as the theatrical release; none of the aforementioned scenes or theme music was removed. The actual 1973 PG-edited version has never been issued on home video in the United States.\\"Big Rental Films of 1973\\", Variety, January 9, 1974 p. 19. It was released on DVD on January 8, 2002.

According to 20th Century Fox records the film required $6,550,000 in rentals to break even, and by 11 December 1970 had made $31,225,000, thus making a profit for the studio. Ultimately, the film made $81.6 million against a budget of $3.025 million.Solomon, Aubrey. Twentieth Century Fox: A Corporate and Financial History (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series). Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1989. . p. 256. It was the sixth most popular film at the French box office in 1970. The film was re-released to theaters in North America in late 1973. To attract audiences to the M*A*S*H television series, which had struggled in the ratings in its first season, 20th Century Fox reissued the film in a version running 112 minutes and bearing a PG rating. Some of the more explicit content from the original R-rated cut was edited out, including segments of graphic surgical operations, Hot Lips' shower scene, and the use of the word \\"fuck\\" during the football game. According to film critic and historian Leonard Maltin, the film's main theme song, \\"Suicide is Painless,\\" was replaced with music by Ahmad Jamal.Maltin, Leonard. Leonard Maltin‚Äôs Movie & Video Guide (NAL). The re-release earned an estimated $3.5 million at the box office. =Critical response= M*A*S*H received mostly positive reviews from critics. The film holds an 86% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 8.4/10. The website's consensus states, \\"Bold, timely, subversive, and above all, funny, M*A*S*H remains a high point in Robert Altman's distinguished filmography.\\" The film also holds a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" In a rave review, John Mahoney of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"the finest American comedy since Some Like It Hot,\\" and \\"the Mister Roberts of the Korean War,\\" as well as \\"The Graduate of 1970.\\"Mahoney, John.

And it is at pains to blend that humor with more operating room gore than I have ever seen in any movie from any place. . . .

In a retrospective review for the Chicago Reader, Jonathan Rosenbaum noted that \\"the film ... helped launch the careers of Elliott Gould, Donald Sutherland, Sally Kellerman, Robert Duvall, and subsequent Altman regulars Rene Auberjonois and John Schuck, and won screenwriter Ring Lardner Jr. an Oscar.\\" Rosenbaum characterized the film as \\"a somewhat adolescent if stylish antiauthoritarian romp. . . . But the misogyny and cruelty behind many of the gags are as striking as the black comedy and the original use of overlapping dialogue.

Accessed Sept. 20, 2019. Writing in The Guardian for the film's 50th anniversary, Noah Gittell also charged it with bearing \\"a deep and unexamined misogyny\\", noting that the treatment of the Houlihan character in particular anticipated such later teen sex comedies as Animal House, Porky's, and Revenge of the Nerds. =Accolades= M*A*S*H won the Palme d'Or at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival. It was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture (lost to Patton), Best Director (lost to Patton), Best Supporting Actress for Sally Kellerman (lost to Helen Hayes for Airport), and Best Film Editing (lost to Patton), and won for Best Adapted Screenplay.

Any hard or friable materials can be ground with low value of metal waste. This type of mill is combined with a classifier for fine tuning of a product size. Operating characteristic *Strength of material - up to 200 MPa *Mohs hardness - up to 7 *Absolute humidity - up to 1% (strong condition) *Feed size - up to 40 mm *Product size - less than 0.5 mm *Capacity - up to 20 t/h Mill uses for hard and friable materials. Wood, most metals and plastics are inoperable. Raw material must be dry. Capacity strongly depends on characteristics of material and a product size. Grinding principle Fig. 1. A schematic drawing of a VSI mill A schematic drawing of a VSI mill is shown at Fig. 1. Raw material particles transports via hopper (1) into the accelerator (2). An accelerator (2) rotates with a high speed and particles increase their speed by a centrifugal force. After leaving channels of the accelerator particles impact with a wear plate (3) in the grinding chamber. A high speed impact leads to destruction of particles into pieces of different size. Big particles (greater than 1 mm) fall down to outlet (5) and later they transport to hopper by an elevator. Other particles (less than 1 mm) lift by air stream into a classifier where blades (4) make rotating dust flow. Middle size particles shift to wall by centrifugal force in a big chamber of a classifier and fall down to cone (6) and later they move into an accelerator (2). Small particles move by air stream to outlet (8). Fine tune of a product size is achieved by changing of blade angle. =Accelerator= Fig. 2. A schematic drawing of the accelerator in a VSI mill A schematic drawing of a VSI mill accelerator is shown at Fig. 2. Very high speed of particle motion needs to obtain good grinding but high speed must lead to high metal waste. Really it doesn't happen because in an accelerator particles move along same material in special inwall area (3) which is bounded by accelerator body and hard metal blade (4). Material in such region holds by centrifugal force. Wear plates (2) and cone (1) use also to avoid wear and tear of an accelerator body. Usage of VSI mills You cannot use VSI mill 'as is'. It requires organized feeding, an air stream, and its cleaning from product (dust). Therefore, a full complete grinding line consists of a feeder, an elevator, a VSI mill with an air classifier, a cyclone, a fan and a bag filter. If the raw material is soggy, some form of drying is necessary before grinding. Grinding and product properties *Implementation of dry grinding process. *Ability to adjust finished product size on-line, during the operation. *Superior selectivity of minerals liberation in Titan M mill as compared to conventional ball mills (for example, copper ore-dressing with Titan VSI mill yields 17,6% copper concentrate with 82,6% extraction as compared to 14,5% and 76,1% obtained with a ball mill grinding, respectively). *Ability to achieve minerals liberation by coarser grinding (for example, 95% liberation of copper-zinc ores is achieved by VSI grinding to minus 0,3 mm, in comparison a similar result can be achieved with a ball mill grinding to minus 0,074 mm). *Increase durability of construction materials ground by Titan M as a result of a mechanical activation (for example, the cellular concrete strength increases 1,5 - 2,5 fold, while cement and lime consumption is reduced by 15 - 25% and by 20%, respectively). *Increase in physical and chemical activity of cements, phosphorites and other materials. *Low energy consumption.

It is named after German Indo-Europeanist Hermann Osthoff, who first formulated it. The law operated in most of the Proto-Indo- European daughter languages, with notable exceptions being the Indo-Iranian and Tocharian branches in which the difference between long and short PIE diphthongs was clearly preserved. Compare: * PIE *dyƒìws \\"skyling, sky god\\" > Vedic Sanskrit dyƒÅÃÅus, but Ancient Greek , with an ordinary diphthong. The term Osthoff's law is usually properly applied to the described phenomenon in Ancient Greek, which itself was an independent innovation from similar developments occurring in Latin and other Indo-European languages. However, the term is often used loosely as a cover term referring to all shortening of long diphthongs in closed syllables. Osthoff's law is, in some version valid, for Greek, Latin, and Celtic but not for Indo-Iranian and Tocharian. Germanic Osthoff's law also probably applied in Germanic, although there is very little evidence to support or refute that claim. Some examples might be: * \\"meat\\" > * \\"young\\" > Balto-Slavic The traditional school of Balto- Slavic linguistics posits compensatory lengthening of liquid diphthongs before laryngeals.

For example: * PIE \\"birch\\" > PBSl. *b·∏ór≈∫as > > Lithuanian , Serbo- Croatian (by liquid metathesis). Some linguists, most notably Kortlandt and Derksen, reject the idea of compensatory lengthening before laryngeals, instead positing that the acute reflects laryngeals directly. Moreover, they reject Osthoff's law for Proto-Balto-Slavic, and reconstruct long vowels intact, but only if they are inherited from Proto-Indo-European.

Chittibabu and Basavaraju are classmates. Chittibabu agrees to marry Sita on the condition that her father Narasaraju send him to the United States for higher studies. To pay for his daughter's wedding, Narasaraju steals money from the office of Bhanumathi's father Srinivasa Rao. Fearing he will be accused of embezzling money, Srinivasa Rao abandons his family and runs away. Basavaraju rejects his bride Bhanumathi without even looking at her. Bhanumathi leaves for the city along with her mother and obtains employment in a firm. Basavaraju meets and falls in love with Bhanumathi, unaware that she is the same woman he rejected earlier. Chittibabu, upon returning from the United States, neglects his wife Sita and falls in love with Bhanumathi. To fix things for Sita, Bhanumathi initiates an elaborate plan and successfully unites her with Chittibabu, while Bhanumathi marries Basavaraju.

Murthy as Narasaraju *Radha Kumari as Basavaraju's stepmother  Production = Development = In the mid-1960s, director Adurthi Subba Rao wanted to make a film with newcomers as the stars. It was decided to adapt K. R. K. Mohan's novel Vakrinchina Sarala Rekhalu with the title Thene Manasulu. The film was produced by C. Sundaram under Babu Movies, Mullapudi Venkata Ramana was hired as the screenwriter and K. Viswanath as associate director. Viswanath also worked as the dialogue writer alongside Athreya. Cinematography was handled by P. S. Selvaraj, and editing by T. Krishna. = Casting = Babu Movies released an advertisement saying the film required newcomers in the lead roles, and thousands of aspiring actors auditioned. Hema Malini and J. Jayalalithaa, not yet the stars of Bollywood and Tamil cinema they would later become, were among those who auditioned, but both were rejected. Krishnam Raju too was an unsuccessful contender. The leading roles finally went to Krishna, Rammohan, Sandhya Rani and Sukanya. This was Krishna's first film in a major role, after he appeared as an extra in the 1962 releases Padandi Munduku and Kula Gotralu. = Filming = Principal photography began at Saradhi Studios. The film was initially planned to be in black and white, but after seven to eight reels were shot, Adurthi decided to reshoot the entire film in Eastmancolor. Thene Manasulu thus became the first Telugu social film to be shot completely in colour. A few scenes required Krishna to ride a scooter, so actor Raavi Kondala Rao, at Adurthi‚Äôs request, taught Krishna to drive the scooter in the streets leading from Saradhi Studios to Sanathnagar. It took four days for Krishna to learn scooter driving.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by K. V. Mahadevan, while the lyrics were written by Athreya and Dasaradhi.  Release and reception  Thene Manasulu was released on 31 March 1965. The film became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. Despite its success, among the four leads only Krishna attained stardom. Adurthi remade the film in Hindi as Doli (1969) which was also successful.

The film stars Krishna, Jayalalitha, Rajanala and Mukkamala in pivotal roles. The film was remade in Bollywood as Farz (1967). Gudachari 116, the first spy film in Telugu starring Superstar Krishna and Jayalalithaa, became such a smash hit that many sequels to the film were made in later years. In this James Bond style film, Jayalalithaa played innocent girl character. She was still at the beginning of her career, and this film brought out her talent and brought her recognition. Plot Secret Agent 116 named Gopi has been assigned the case of the homicide of a fellow secret agent (303) by the head of CID. 303 had found evidence that can help identify the perpetrators. During this investigation, Gopi meets lovely Radha in a flight journey, and both end up falling in love with each other. The traitor responsible for the killing of agent 303 has gone to meet 303's sister Kamla and tells her that he is a CID inspector and investigating his brother's case, warning that her brother's killer may make an attempt on her pretending as his colleague and friend. He elsewhere unsuccessfully continued on the life of agent 116. 116 goes to meet Kamla and sees 303's portrait and notes down the studio photographer's name, but Kamla is convinced that 116 is the killer of her brother. Kamla is approached by another mafia don, Damodar, for her help in eliminating 116, to which she agrees. Damodar turns out to be Radha's father, when Radha introduces him, Gopi gets suspicious about him and commences a background check, which reveals that her father is a gangster. As he sets out his case against Damodar, he continues his romance with Radha. During Radha's birthday party, Damodar directs his henchman to kill 116, who escapes after some car chase. 116 hesitantly reveals to Radha that her father is a gangster. Heartbroken, Radha confronts her father, who tells her that he was forced into his life of crime and terrorism, and some other person controls them all, which was overheard by 116 and his assistant, who are hiding outside. 116 goes out for his search for the real culprit to a skyscraper apartment where Kamla was plotted. Kamla seductively dances and mixes some intoxicant pill in his drink, which overlooked by 116, eventually made him senseless. Goons take him to their secret den in the city outskirts, along with Radha, who mistakes them as Hospital Ward boys. In the den, 116 captures one of the goon leaders and forces him to reveal some information. 116 fights his way with Radha and escapes in a vehicle. In the meantime, CID agents trace a letter leading to clues regarding the Chinese conspiracy to destabilize the nation and accommodated by traitors inside, led by a person wearing a Mao uniform named Supremo, who only speaks a few broken English sentences. The rest of the movie follows 116's efforts to thwart a foreign conspiracy against India.

History  Technology  Privacy-enhanced computer display technology utilizes a public display image ( denoted Pij for the pixel value at location i,j in the public image), a secret display image (Sij, similarly denoted for pixel value at pixel location i,j ), a proprietary device driver, a CRT capable of rapid refresh rates (up to 120 Hz) and a set of synchronized ferroelectric shutter glasses. The device driver causes the computer monitor to alternately display the pixelwise difference (Pij ‚Äì Sij) and the unaltered secret image (Sij). When viewed directly without the shutter glasses, the human eye's persistence of vision blurs the two images into [(Pij ‚Äì Sij + Sij) / 2], which reduces to (Pij / 2), which is the public image, effectively preventing an unintended recipient from viewing the secret image. The intended recipient, wearing the synchronized glasses, will see only the (Sij) secret image. Advantages and disadvantages The major advantage of the shutter glass system was that it allowed the same display to be used for multiple unrelated images, one of which was visible without any glasses at all. Unfortunately, the contrast ratio of the public image is only 1/2 the available contrast ratio of the CRT when driven with only a public image. A secondary issue was that although the image was privacy-enhanced, it was not secure. The secret image appeared as a \\"ghost\\" if one moved one's head rapidly - or struck the viewer's head with a soft object, thereby offsetting the two image fields and revealing the edges of the difference image. With the rapid growth of handheld phones with integrated digital cameras (and fast shutters) the phone's camera video will often reveal alternating frames of the public and secret images. This effectively breaks the privacy capability of the system. A final issue is the decline of the CRT and the rise of the LCD in display technology, because nearly all LCDs are too slow to support the 120 Hz or faster refresh rate needed for this privacy enhancement to work. Meanwhile, lenticular Monitor_filter have diminished the need for the shutterglass technology.

Inside View Saint Petersburg Toy Museum () is a non-state cultural establishment.  History  The Saint-Petersburg Toy Museum is a member of the Union of Museums of Russia. It was established in 1997 as a non-state cultural establishment, subsidised by private companies. It is the second museum of toys in Russia after the oldest Artistic-educational museum of that kind in Sergiev Posad near Moscow, which treats pedagogic problems mainly. Folk toy in the St. Petersburg Toy Museum (Russia) The Saint-Petersburg Toy Museum was established as an artistic museum with the main task of collecting, storing, exposing and studying a toy not only as a unique item of material culture, but also as a unique art form, that includes ancient national traditions and the most recent artistic tendencies. The guide and children in the St. Petersburg Toy Museum (Russia) It was the insight to a toy as to the synthetic art form, existing in complex connection between the aesthetic and playing functions, and possessing the richest palette of artistic means, that predetermined the allocation of the collection of author's artistic toy (partly represented in the ‚ÄúPetersburg Toy‚Äù album) as being the main museum fund. It is this very collection that predetermines the specificity and uniqueness of the Saint-Petersburg Museum. Whistles-Toy in the St. Petersburg Toy Museum (Russia) According to art critic's of the museum opinion, author's toy (strictly speaking, playing objects) born in the workshops of artist, working in different techniques: draughtsman, painters, sculptors, designers, architects etc. was formed only in the last 20 ‚Äì 25 years, being rather original field of present-day culture, but not yet the sphere of interests of artistic museums or toy museums. We don't possess data about the existence of any significant collections of that kind in Europe. Children in the St. Petersburg Toy Museum (Russia) However the author's artistic toy fund is not the only direction of activity of the Saint- Petersburg Museum. Besides it the museum has collections of folk toys (both the Russian and foreign) and fabric toys, which are being permanently increased. The possession of these three funds makes it possible to study and exhibit a toy more completely and multilaterally. Having united artists, art critics and pedagogues around it, the Saint-Petersburg Museum takes part in working out interesting exhibition programs and artistic festivals, orientated on a broad age diapason of participators and visitors. Not being orientated only on children's audience, it, therefore, proposes close cooperation with different institutions in common working out of complex pedagogic programs and participation in its provision.

He served as Bishop of Richmond, Virginia (1841-1850) and Bishop of Wheeling, West Virginia (1850-1874). Early life Whelan was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and at age 10 he enrolled at Mount St. Mary's College in Emmitsburg, where he studied the classics. Following his graduation with the highest honors in 1826, he completed his theological studies at the Seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris, France. He was ordained to the priesthood in Versailles on May 1, 1831. Career Returning to the United States, Whelen became a faculty member and business manager at Mount St. Mary's, and also served as pastor of Harper's Ferry. His pastoral responsibilities included missions at Martinsburg, Winchester and Bath (each separated by significant horseback journeys) as well as numerous Catholic families who could not access Catholic institutions of any kind. On December 19, 1840, Whelan was appointed the second Bishop of Richmond, Virginia, by Pope Gregory XVI. He received his episcopal consecration on March 21, 1841 from Archbishop Samuel Eccleston, P.S.S., with Bishops Benedict Joseph Fenwick, S.J., and John Joseph Hughes serving as co- consecrators, at Baltimore. The second Catholic bishop in the United States, Bishop Jean Dubois had similarly initially lived in Richmond, but soon moved the seat of his extremely large diocese west (to Bardstown, Kentucky) to serve Catholics in remote mountain areas, as well as to escape anti-Catholic and other civil strife in Virginia's capitol. Furthermore, after the brief American episcopate of his predecessor, the seat had been vacant for more than a decade before Whelan's appointment and consecration, and Richmond had become a stronghold of the Know-Nothing political party, known for its anti-Catholic and racial prejudices and propensity for mob violence. Since there were only six priests in the still very large diocese of Virginia at this time, Whelan appealed to the Societies for the Propagation of the Faith in Paris, Lyon and Vienna to increase the diocese's clerical ranks. He also established a seminary college on the outskirts of Richmond, where Whelan himself resided and taught when he was not visiting remote areas of the diocese. He also established several parishes, missions and schools. By 1848 Whelan requested that his see be divided, with the Allegheny Mountains as the natural boundary. The Holy See granted his request by creating the Diocese of Wheeling on July 19, 1850. Four days later, on July 23, Whelan was named Ordinary of the new Wheeling Diocese, and John McGill, a former lawyer, succeeded him as Bishop of Richmond. Bishop Whelan became a civic leader in Wheeling, the new diocese's largest city (pop. 13,161). It had grown because of its location on the National Road and access to both water and coal power. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad formally reached Wheeling in 1853, but many Irish emigrants building that and other railroads or working in the new factories had already passed through or settled in the city. Other industrializing areas of the new diocese (which initially had only two or four Catholic churches and two or six Catholic priests) included Charlestown and to a lesser extent Huntington and Martinsburg/Berkeley Springs/Harper's Ferry. The mountainous new diocese consisted of several distinct valleys, with many immigrants but limited funds and access to social services. The new bishop became known for his resourcefulness, even performing carpentry and stone work himself. Bishop Whelan also did not escape anti-Catholicism or the Know-Nothings, for when a papal nuncio arrived on the new railroad in 1853, Catholics were instructed to stand guard in a ring around the Cathedral block to ensure the envoy's safety. When Virginia seceded from the United States in 1861 a Unionist government was organized in Wheeling, which chose as its governor Francis H. Pierpont. Bishop Whelan believed this government to be usurped and that the government in Richmond was the only state government. He refused to take the oath of loyalty, which included an oath to the Pierpont government, and was apprehensive about his probable arrest.1862 June 23 Bishop Whelan to James Alphonsus McMaster President Lincoln learned of the intention to arrest the Bishop but the authorities in Wheeling were instructed on May 21, 1862, by Edwin M. Stanton- \\"The President being informed that you intend or threaten to arrest Bishop Whelan, the Catholic Bishop of your city, he directs that you take no action against the Bishop without the President's order.\\"The War of the Rebellion: a Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Washington, DC, 1898, Series II, Vol. 3, pg. 560 No actions were taken against Bishop Whelan during the course of the war. As in Richmond, Bishop Whelan invited religious congregations to his new diocese to provide needed social services. By the time he died, the diocese had 48 churches, 29 priests, three religious congregations of women, six schools for girls, a school for boys, an orphanage, and a hospital. From 1869 to 1870, Bishop Whelan attended the First Vatican Council, where he opposed papal infallibility because he thought such a declaration would be untimely. Death and legacy Bishop Whelan fell ill in 1874 and was taken to St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore, where he later died from liver disease at age 65. A hall at Wheeling Jesuit University, the youngest of the nation's Jesuit Universities (dedicated in 1955), is named for the pioneering bishop.

It was first created in October 1940 and operated until 31 December 1945 when its functions were dispersed to industry, other departments within MIT, and in 1951, the newly formed MIT Lincoln Laboratory. The use of microwaves for various radio and radar uses was highly desired before the war, but existing microwave devices like the klystron were far too low powered to be useful. Alfred Lee Loomis, a millionaire and physicist who headed his own private laboratory, organized the Microwave Committee to consider these devices and look for improvements. In early 1940, Winston Churchill organized what became the Tizard Mission to introduce US researchers to several new technologies the UK had been developing. Among these was the cavity magnetron, a leap forward in the creation of microwaves that made them practical for the first time. Loomis arranged for funding under the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) and reorganized the Microwave Committee at MIT to study the magnetron and radar technology in general. Lee A. DuBridge served as the Rad Lab director. The lab rapidly expanded, and within months was larger than the UK's efforts which had been running for several years by this point. By 1943 the lab began to deliver a stream of ever-improved devices, which could be produced in huge numbers by the US's industrial base. At its peak, the Rad Lab employed 4,000 at MIT and several other labs around the world, and designed half of all the radar systems used during the war. By the end of the war, the US held a leadership position in a number of microwave-related fields. Among their notable products were the SCR-584, the finest gun-laying radar of the war, and the SCR-720, an airborne interception radar that became the standard late-war system for both US and UK night fighters. They also developed the H2X, a version of the British H2S bombing radar that operated at shorter wavelengths in the X band. The Rad Lab also developed Loran-A, the first worldwide radio navigation system, which originally was known as \\"LRN\\" for Loomis Radio Navigation. Formation During the mid- and late-1930s, radio systems for the detection and location of distant targets had been developed under great secrecy in the United States and Great Britain, as well as in several other nations, notably Germany, the USSR, and Japan. These usually operated at Very High Frequency (VHF) wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum and carried several cover names, such as Ranging and Direction Finding (RDF) in Great Britain. In 1941, the U. S. Navy coined the acronym 'RADAR' (RAdio Detection And Ranging) for such systems; this soon led to the name 'radar' and spread to other countries. The potential advantages of operating such systems in the Ultra High Frequency (UHF or microwave) region were well known and vigorously pursued. One of these advantages was smaller antennas, a critical need for detection systems on aircraft. The primary technical barrier to developing UHF systems was the lack of a usable source for generating high-power microwaves. In February 1940, researchers John Randall and Harry Boot at Birmingham University in Great Britain built a resonant cavity magnetron to fill this need; it was quickly placed within the highest level of secrecy. Shortly after this breakthrough, Britain's Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Roosevelt agreed that the two nations would pool their technical secrets and jointly develop many urgently needed warfare technologies. At the initiation of this exchange in the late summer of 1940, the Tizard Mission brought to America one of the first of the new magnetrons. On October 6, Edward George Bowen, a key developer of RDF at the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) and a member of the mission, demonstrated the magnetron, producing some 15,000 watts (15 kW) of power at 3 GHz, i.e. a wavelength of 10cm. A March 1940 meeting at the University of California at Berkeley concerning the planned cyclotron (seen on the blackboard), from left to right: Ernest O. Lawrence, Arthur H. Compton, Vannevar Bush, James B. Conant, Karl T. Compton, and Alfred Lee Loomis American researchers and officials were amazed at the magnetron, and the NDRC immediately started plans for manufacturing and incorporating the devices. Alfred Lee Loomis, who headed the NDRC Microwave Committee, led in establishing the Radiation Laboratory at MIT as a joint Anglo-American effort for microwave research and system development using the new magnetron. The name 'Radiation Laboratory', selected by Loomis when he selected the building for it on the MIT campus, was intentionally deceptive,\\"The MIT Radiation Laboratory - RLE's Microwave Heritage\\", RLE Currents, v.2 no. 4, Spring 1991 in 18.4MB PDF albeit obliquely correct in that radar uses radiation in a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. It was chosen to imply the laboratory's mission was similar to that of the Ernest O. Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory at UC Berkeley; i.e., that it employed scientists to work on nuclear physics research. At the time, nuclear physics was regarded as relatively theoretical and inapplicable to military equipment, as this was before atomic bomb development had begun. Ernest Lawrence was an active participant in forming the Rad Lab and personally recruited many key members of the initial staff. Most of the senior staff were Ph.D. physicists who came from university positions. They usually had no more than an academic knowledge of microwaves, and almost no background involving electronic hardware development. Their capability, however, to tackle complex problems of almost any type was outstanding. Later in life, nine members of the staff were recipients of the Nobel Prize for other accomplishments. In June 1941, the NDRC became part of the new Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), also administered by Vannevar Bush, who reported directly to President Roosevelt. The OSRD was given almost unlimited access to funding and resources, with the Rad Lab receiving a large share for radar research and development. Starting in 1942, the Manhattan Project absorbed a number of the Rad Lab physicists into Los Alamos and Lawrence's facility at Berkeley. This was made simpler by Lawrence and Loomis being involved in all of these projects. Operations The Radiation Laboratory officially opened in November 1940, using of space in MIT's Building 4, and under $500,000 initial funding from the NDRC. In addition to the Director, Lee DuBridge, I. I. Rabi was the deputy director for scientific matters, and F. Wheeler Loomis (no relation to Alfred Loomis) was deputy director for administration. E. G. (\\"Taffy\\") Bowen was assigned as a representative of Great Britain. Even before opening, the founders identified the first three projects for the Rad Lab. In the order of priority, these were (1) a 10-cm detection system (called Airborne Intercept or AI) for fighter aircraft, (2) a 10-cm gun-aiming system (called Gun Laying or GL) for anti-aircraft batteries, and (3) a long-range airborne radio navigation system. To initiate the first two of these projects, the magnetron from Great Britain was used to build a 10-cm \\"breadboard\\" set; this was tested successfully from the rooftop of Building 4 in early January 1941. All members of the initial staff were involved in this endeavor. Under Project 1 led by Edwin M. McMillan, an \\"engineered\\" set with an antenna using a parabolic reflector followed. This, the first microwave radar built in America, was tested successfully in an aircraft on March 27, 1941. It was then taken to Great Britain by Taffy Bowen and tested in comparison with a 10-cm set being developed there. For the final system, the Rad Lab staff combined features from their own and the British set. It eventually became the SCR-720, used extensively by both the U.S. Army Air Corps and the British Royal Air Force. For Project 2, a 4-foot- and later 6-foot-wide (1.2 then 1.8 m) parabolic reflector on a pivoting mount was selected. Also, this set would use an electro-mechanical computer (called a Predictor-correlator) to keep the antenna aimed at an acquired target. Ivan A. Getting served as the project leader. Being much more complicated than the Airborne Intercept and required to be very rugged for field use, an engineered GL was not completed until December 1941. This eventually was fielded as the ubiquitous SCR-584, first gaining attention by directing the anti-aircraft fire that downed the about 85 percent of German V-1 flying bombs (\\"buzz bombs\\") attacking London.Conant, Jennet (2002). pp. 271‚Äì272. Project 3, a long-range navigation system, was of particular interest to Great Britain. They had an existing hyperbolic navigation system, called GEE, but it was inadequate, in both range and accuracy, to support aircraft during bombing runs on distant targets in Europe. When briefed by the Tizard Mission about GEE, Alfred Loomis personally conceptualized a new type of system that would overcome the deficiencies of GEE, and the development of his LORAN (an acronym for Long Range Navigation) was adopted as an initial project. The LORAN Division was established for the project and headed by Donald G. Fink. Operating in the Low Frequency (LF) portion of the radio spectrum, LORAN was the only non-microwave project of the Rad Lab. Incorporating major elements of GEE, LORAN was highly successful and beneficial to the war effort. By the end of hostilities, about 30 percent of the Earth's surface was covered by LORAN stations and used by 75,000 aircraft and surface vessels.Conant, Jennet (2002). pp. 265-267. Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, work at the Rad Lab greatly expanded. At the height of its activities, the Rad Lab employed nearly 4,000 people working in several countries. The Rad Lab had constructed, and was the initial occupant of, MIT's famous Building 20. Costing just over $1 million, this was one of the longest-surviving World War II temporary structures. Activities eventually encompassed physical electronics, electromagnetic properties of matter, microwave physics, and microwave communication principles, and the Rad Lab made fundamental advances in all of these fields. Half of the radars deployed by the U. S. military during World War II were designed at the Rad Lab, including over 100 different microwave systems costing $1.5 billion.Guelac. Henry E.; Radar in World War II, Am. Inst. Physics, 1987, pp. 690-691, All of these sets improved considerably on pre-microwave, VHF systems from the Naval Research Laboratory and the Army's Signal Corps Laboratories, as well as British radars such as Robert Watson-Watt's Chain Home and Taffy Bowen's early airborne RDF sets. Although the Rad Lab was initiated as a joint Anglo-American operation and many of its products were adopted by the British military, researchers in Great Britain* continued with the development of microwave radar and, particularly with cooperation from Canada, produced many types of new systems. For the exchange of information, the Rad Lab established a branch operation in England, and a number of British scientists and engineers worked on assignments at the Rad Lab. *At the T. R. E., Telecommunications Research Establishment The resonant-cavity magnetron continued to evolve at the Rad Lab. A team led by I.I. Rabi first extended the operation of the magnetron from 10-cm (called S-band), to 6-cm (C-band), then to 3-cm (X-band), and eventually to 1-cm (K-band). To keep pace, all of the other radar sub-systems also were evolving continuously. The Transmitter Division, under Albert G. Hill, eventually involved a staff of 800 persons in these efforts. A radically different type of antenna for X-band systems was invented by Luis W. Alvarez and used in three new systems: an airborne mapping radar called Eagle, a blind-landing Ground Control Approach (GCA) system, and a ground-based Microwave Early-Warning (MEW) system. The latter two were highly successful and carried over into post-war applications. Eagle eventually was converted to a very effective mapping radar called H2X or Mickey and used by the U. S. Air Corps and Navy as well as the British RAF.Buderi, Robert (1996). pp. 135-137, 186-189. The most ambitious Rad Lab effort with long-term significance was Project Cadillac. Led by Jerome B. Wiesner, the project involved a high-power radar carried in a pod under a TBM Avenger aircraft and a Combat Information Center aboard an aircraft carrier. The objective was an airborne early warning and control system, providing the U. S. Navy with a surveillance capability to detect low-flying enemy aircraft at a range in excess of 100 miles (161 km). The project was initiated at a low level in mid-1942, but with the later advent of Japanese Kamikaze threats in the Pacific Theater of Operations, the work was greatly accelerated, eventually involving 20 percent of the Rad Lab staff. A prototype was flown in August 1944, and the system became operational early the next year. Although too late to affect the final war effort, the project laid the foundation for significant developments in the following years. As the Rad Lab started, a laboratory was set up to develop electronic countermeasures (ECM), technologies to block enemy radars and communications. With Frederick E. Terman as director, this soon moved to the Harvard University campus (just a mile from MIT) and became the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL). Organizationally separate from the Rad Lab, but also under the OSRD, the two operations had much in common throughout their existences. Closure When the Radiation Laboratory closed, the OSRD agreed to continue funding for the Basic Research Division, which officially became part of MIT on July 1, 1946, as the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT (RLE). Other wartime research was taken up by the MIT Laboratory for Nuclear Science, which was founded at the same time. Both laboratories principally occupied Building 20 until 1957. Most of the important research results of the Rad Lab were documented in a 28-volume compilation entitled the MIT Radiation Laboratory Series, edited by Louis N. Ridenour and published by McGraw-Hill between 1947 and 1953. This is no longer in print, but the series was re-released as a two- CD-ROM set in 1999 () by publisher Artech House. More recently, it has become available online. Postwar declassification of the work at the MIT Rad Lab made available, via the Series, a quite-large body of knowledge about advanced electronics. A reference (identity long forgotten) credited the Series with the development of the post-World War II electronics industry. With the cryptology and cryptographic efforts centered at Bletchley Park and Arlington Hall and the Manhattan Project, the development of microwave radar at the Radiation Laboratory represents one of the most significant, secret, and outstandingly successful technological efforts spawned by the Anglo-American relations in World War II. The Radiation Laboratory was named an IEEE Milestone in 1990.

It is a co-educational high school operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities with students from years 7 to 12. The school was established in 1969 as a result of the growing population in the Engadine area. History Established in 1969, Engadine High School has been awarded the Director- General's Award for achievement for: Excellence in Performing Arts (2002), Consolidating a strong learning culture (2004) and Outstanding Linkages Program with Primary Schools (2006). In 2009 a celebration of the school's fortieth anniversary was held in the school grounds for students and locals. The school's original motto was \\"To find and not to yield\\", taken from the Tennyson poem \\"Ulysses\\". This was later changed to \\"Dream, Believe, Succeed\\". Facilities The school consists of four primary classroom blocks with additional buildings hosting the Library, Hall and Canteen. Several portable buildings are located around the school hosting additional classrooms and facilities such as the Band Room. The four primary blocks undergo constant improvements on a classroom basis which has in recent years included the installation of new science laboratories, new music rooms and the installation of projectors and screens in every classroom. Specialist class rooms include; two sewing rooms, four wood/metal work rooms, two kitchens (including one with an ‚Äòindustrial kitchen‚Äô for HSC and VET subjects), five computer labs, several music rooms including a specialist computer lab, a band room, one dance/drama rooms and five modern science laboratories. From the commencement of the 2012 school year the school had full disabled access for students in wheelchairs in both the mainstream school and in the support unit. This has been achieved through the installation of ramps and a lift around the campus. Additional recent construction work has seen a garage built for the new school bus, the first in its history, along the rear of C-Block. In 2012 as a result of constant issues the Astroturf that was briefly on the basketball courts, funded by an external grant, was pulled up and was replaced with rubber mulch. The main quad has also been extended to include a larger covered seating area alongside the old Year 11 and 12 Bays with the seats being provided by senior metalwork classes.  Activities  Engadine High School has had success in extracurricular activities. In 2000 Engadine High School won the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge with their performance The Time Machine. Taking the audience on an adventure to space, the aztecs, a visit from aliens. In 2001 the school was named equal first, in The Australian newspaper in the category of Highest level in the performing arts over a sustained period of time, Australia wide. The school was placed 5th in The 2006 Rock Eisteddfod Challenge (Sydney Open Division) with their production of Be Yourself. The schools Junior and Senior Dance Ensembles represented the school and the Sydney Region Dance Festival, 2006 Schools Spectacular and local charity performances. In recent years the school has become successful at the ‚ÄòF1 Challenge‚Äô with each year group sending through at least one team to regional competitions and beyond as part of their Year 8 TAS classes. The 2011 team has succeeded in the state competition and will be heading to the nationals in early 2012. Resources including the car production machine are pooled between Engadine and Menai High Schools with fierce competition at regional and state level between teams from the two schools. The School's bands (Premier and Concert) are a highly popular activity and involve many students from across the school, in addition Year 6 primary school students join the band to begin practicing before moving up to Engadine so they can slot right in straight away. During 2011 the band made a visit to California where they performed at several locations including Santa Monica Pier, Universal Studios, Disney and, as a first ever performance at the location, outside Madame Tussauds on Hollywood Boulevard. In June 2012 the school hosted its second musical, a rendition of ‚Äò13‚Äô, incorporating band, drama and design and technology students. It is anticipated that a musical will become a regular school feature in coming years.  Controversies  In December 2013, it was alleged by a parent of a student with Down syndrome that her daughter and other students of the support unit were not invited to the Year 10 formal. However, the school responded by claiming that the formal was not organised by the school itself, but rather by Year 10 students and their parents, and that the students in the support unit had been invited to the formal. Other parents defended the school, saying notes given to the support unit students did not always make it home. In early 2018, the principal of Engadine High School was scrutinized for sexist comments referring to the dress of female students; \\"If I... Had some of you as daughters... I would be ashamed\\".

The accident caused the death of fourteen people (three crewmen and eleven people in the building) and damage estimated at (equivalent to about $M in ), although the building's structural integrity was not compromised. Details alt=A black-and-white photo of airplane wreckage embedded in the facade, high up On Saturday, July 28, 1945, Lieutenant Colonel William F. Smith Jr. was piloting a B-25 Mitchell bomber on a routine personnel transport mission from Bedford Army Air Field in Massachusetts to Newark Metropolitan Airport in New Jersey. Smith asked for clearance to land, but he was advised of zero visibility. Proceeding anyway, he became disoriented by the fog and turned right instead of left after passing the Chrysler Building. At 9:40 a.m., the aircraft crashed into the north side of the Empire State Building, between the 78th and 80th floors, making an hole in the building into the offices of the War Relief Society and the National Catholic Welfare Council. One engine shot through the south side opposite the impact and flew as far as the next block, dropping and landing on the roof of a nearby building and causing a fire that destroyed a penthouse art studio. The other engine and part of the landing gear fell down an elevator shaft. The resulting fire was extinguished in 40 minutes. The Empire State Building fire is the only significant fire at such a height to be brought under control by firefighters. Between 50 and 60 sightseers were on the 86th floor observation deck when the crash happened. Fourteen people were killed: Colonel Smith, Staff Sergeant Christopher Domitrovich, and Navy Aviation Machinist's Mate Albert Perna, who was hitching a ride, and eleven civilians in the building. Perna's body was not found until two days later, when search crews discovered that it had entered an elevator shaft and fallen to the bottom. The other two crewmen were burned beyond recognition. Elevator operator Betty Lou Oliver was thrown from her elevator car on the 80th floor and suffered severe burns. First aid workers placed her on another elevator car to transport her to the ground floor, but the cables supporting that car had been damaged in the incident, and the car fell 75 stories, ending up in the basement. Oliver survived the fall but had a broken pelvis, back and neck when rescuers found her amongst the rubble. This remains the world record for the longest survived elevator fall. Despite the damage and loss of life, the building was open for business on many floors on the next Monday morning, less than 48 hours later. The crash spurred the passage of the long-pending Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, as well as the insertion of retroactive provisions into the law, allowing people to sue the government for the accident.

He is a Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University and Emeritus Professor and Honorary Research Fellow at the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Oceans Studies (IASOS), University of Tasmania. Career Paltridge obtained a BSc in 1961 from the University of Queensland, a PhD in 1965 from University of Melbourne and a DSc in 1976 from the University of Queensland. He worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in 1966, then as Senior Research Scientist for the Radio and Space Research Station at Ditton Park, Buckinghamshire, England, from 1967‚Äì1968. In 1968 he took up a role as Research Scientist at the CSIRO, Australia, where he remained until 1981. During that time he worked briefly as a Consultant to the World Meteorological Organization in 1975 in Geneva, Switzerland, where he was involved in the early development of the World Climate Program, and in 1979 he was posted as Senior Visiting Scientist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He was elected as a fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 1980. In 1981 he was seconded as Director of the Environmental Executive of the Institute of Petroleum, and in 1982 he returned to the CSIRO as Chief Research Scientist, where he remained until 1989. He briefly served as Senior Visiting Scientist at the National Climate Program Officehttp://www.climate.noaa.gov/ from 1989‚Äì1990. From 1990 to 2002 he was Professor and Director of the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Oceans Studies at the University of Tasmania and at the same time, from 1991‚Äì2002, he was the Chief Executive Officer of the Antarctic Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Tasmania. Paltridge was involved in studies on stratospheric electricity, the effect of the atmosphere on plant growth and the radiation properties of clouds. Paltridge researched topics such as the optimum design of plants and the economics of climate forecasting, and worked on atmospheric radiation and the theoretical basis of climate. Paltridge introduced the subsequently disputed hypothesis that the earth/atmosphere climate system adopts a format that maximises its rate of thermodynamic dissipation, i.e., entropy production. This suggests a governing constraint by a principle of maximum rate of entropy production. According to this principle, prediction of the broad-scale steady-state distribution of cloud, temperature and energy flows in the ocean and atmosphere may be possible when one has sufficient data about the system for that purpose, but does not have fully detailed data about every variable of the system. As co-author with C.M.R. Platt, in 1976 Paltridge published a textbook entitled Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology.Paltridge, G.W., Platt, C.M.R. Platt (1976). Radiative Processes in Meteorology and Climatology, Elsevier Scientific Publishing Company, Amsterdam, . Views on climate change In August 2009 he published a book on the global warming debate, The Climate Caper. Paltridge believes that anthropogenic global warming is real, but disagrees with mainstream scientific opinion in that he thinks that the warming will probably be too small to be a threat. On the alleged global warming hiatus (1998 - 2014): :[W]e have at least to consider the possibility that the scientific establishment behind the global warming issue has been drawn into the trap of seriously overstating the climate problem‚Äîor, what is much the same thing, of seriously understating the uncertainties associated with the climate problem‚Äîin its effort to promote the cause. It is a particularly nasty trap in the context of science, because it risks destroying, perhaps for centuries to come, the unique and hard-won reputation for honesty which is the basis for society‚Äôs respect for scientific endeavor.Climate Change‚Äôs Inherent Uncertainties by G.

Among his friends were Charlie Chaplin and family whose Swiss home M. Lysy visited for extended stays. Early life Alberto Lysy was born in Buenos Aires to Ukrainian immigrants in 1935. At age five, his father introduced him to the violin. Lysy left school at age 13 to devote more time to the instrument, and was subsequently trained by violinist Ljerko Spiller. Lysy traveled to London in 1952, where he enrolled in the Silver School; soon destitute, however, he made ends meet by playing under a bridge near the Royal National Theatre. Following a performance for UNESCO in Paris, he returned to Argentina in 1953, though a second opportunity in 1955 took him again to Europe, where he became the first South American artist to obtain a prize at the Queen Elisabeth International Music Competition, held that year in Brussels. Following the awards ceremony, the Queen Consort Princess Lilian, gave Lysy a vintage violin, and later invited him to the Royal Palace of Brussels for a series of duets.La Naci√≥n: Alberto Lysy, maestro busca talentos Professional life Lysy approached a member of the jury to that occasion, Yehudi Menuhin, with a request that the renowned violinist make him a student. Menuhin had never mentored a pupil, and Lysy returned to Buenos Aires. Narrowly skirting military conscription (mandatory in Argentina until 1994), Lysy was recommended by Menuhin for a Rockefeller Foundation grant, and he rejoined his benefactor in Gstaad (becoming his first and only personal pupil). He lived and performed with Menuhin for the next several years, and the elder performer gave him a prized Guarnerius violin, dated 1742. Menuhin arranged performances for Lysy with consular figures in classical music such as cellist Pablo Casals, pianist Benjamin Britten, and conductor Nadia Boulanger. Returning to Argentina, he established a chamber music ensemble, Camerata Bariloche, in 1967. Touring extensively and around the world, he set aside a select group of students to create Camerata Lysy, in 1971. Directing both groups for the next decade, Lysy and these ensembles performed with numerous celebrated conductors and orchestras, including Pierre Boulez, Adrian Boult, Colin Davis, Igor Markevitch, the New York Philharmonic, the National Symphony Orchestra (Washington, DC), the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic, and the Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra. He has appeared at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Queen Elizabeth Hall of London, and Victoria Hall (Geneva), as well as in the former Soviet Union, China and Japan. The ensembles recorded numerous albums for the EMI label.answers.com: Alberto Lysy Lysy honored his mentor by founding the International Menuhin Music Academy, in 1977, in Gstaad. He also established musical events such as the Festival Delle Nazioni in Citt√† di Castello and directed the Recontres Musicales in Switzerland and the Lysy Festival in Argentina. His work with children earned him the Stradivari International Pedagogical Prize in 2006, and he retired as Director of the Menuhin Music Academy, the following year. Personal life Lysy married Benedetta Origo, daughter of Iris Origo. One of his children, Antonio Lysy, became a renowned cellist and is the head of the music program at UCLA in Los Angeles. The renowned performer and teacher died in Lausanne on December 30, 2009; he was 74.Swiss Info: Alberto Lysy muri√≥ en Lausana References 1935 births 2009 deaths Argentine classical musicians Argentine conductors (music) Argentine music Argentine people of Ukrainian descent Argentine violinists Male classical violinists 20th-century classical violinists 20th-century conductors (music) 20th-century male musicians ","title":"Alberto Lysy"},{"id":"23784574","text":"circulatory system of Viviparus contectus As in other molluscs, the circulatory system of gastropods is open, with the fluid, or haemolymph, flowing through sinuses and bathing the tissues directly. The haemolymph typically contains haemocyanin, and is blue in colour. Circulation The heart is muscular and located in the anterior part of the visceral mass. In the great majority of species, it has two chambers; an auricle, which receives haemolymph from the gill or lung, and a ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta. However, some primitive gastropods possess two gills, each supplying its own auricle, so that their heart has three chambers. The aorta is relatively short, and soon divides into two main vessels, one supplying the visceral mass, and the other supplying the head and foot. In some groups, these two vessels arise directly from the heart, so that the animal may be said to have two aortas. These two vessels in turn divide into many finer vessels throughout the body, and deliver haemolymph to open arterial sinuses where it bathes and oxygenates the tissues. De-oxygenated haemolymph drains into a large venous sinus within the head and foot, which contains the nephridium, an excretory organ with a function similar to that of the vertebrate kidney. From here it passes into vessels within the gill, or into the capillary network of the pulmonate lung, before returning to the heart. In some genera, such as the large marine snail Busycon, the main anterior artery (which supplies the head and foot) includes an enlarged muscular region. This structure is effectively a secondary heart, and probably helps to maintain blood pressure in the vessels of the head. Haemolymph Because of the open circulatory system of gastropods and other molluscs, there is no clear distinction between the blood and the lymph, or interstitial fluid. As a result, the circulatory fluid is commonly referred to as haemolymph, rather than blood. The majority of gastropods have haemolymph containing the respiratory pigment haemocyanin. This is a copper-containing protein that helps to carry oxygen, and gives the haemolymph a pale blue colour. In the freshwater Planorbid snails, however, the haemocyanin is replaced by haemoglobin, and thus their haemolymph is red rather than blue. Some gastropods, such as the sea hare Aplysia, appear to lack respiratory pigments altogether. Regardless of whether they employ haemocyanin or haemoglobin, the pigments are dissolved directly in the serum, with no equivalent of the red blood cells found in mammals. However, the haemolymph does contain amoebocytes, which may have a role in the immune system.

The Centre publishes two major journals the Australian Indigenous Law Review and the Indigenous Law Bulletin.  History  The Indigenous Law Centre was previously the Aboriginal Law Research Unit which was established at University of New South Wales on 23 April, 1981. The origins however go back to early 1970 when the first Aboriginal legal service was established. Professor Hal Wootten was its first President and he operated the ALS from the UNSW Law School in its early years. When the Whitlam Government funded Aboriginal Legal Services, the ALS's found their time taken up with criminal representation and had no time for law reform advocacy. Thus UNSW Faculty of Law members found themselves still being contacted to give advice on legal issues such as land rights claims, environment law and administrative law matters. A small group of academics ‚Äì Professor Garth Nettheim, Richard Chisholm, Pat O'Shane and Neil Rees established a \\"back-up centre\\" or legal research centre that could assist the frontline Aboriginal Legal services and Aboriginal Land Councils. Thus in 1986 the Aboriginal Law Research Unit became the Aboriginal Law Centre. The ILC has worked with the Indigenous community and has been involved in High Court cases such as Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen, Mabo v Queensland (No 2), and international indigenous rights advocacy such as the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  Publications  The Indigenous Legal Centre publishes two journals: * The Australian Indigenous Law Review * The Indigenous Law Bulletin  Research  The Indigenous Law Centre undertakes research in a number of areas: =Public law= * Focusing on legal issues related to the recognition of Indigenous rights and constitutional reform; extra parliamentary representation of Indigenous peoples; critical engagement with the idea of a bills of rights; legislative developments affecting Indigenous rights; native title and land rights; stolen wages; \\"democracy\\" and Indigenous peoples; intellectual property reform; the nexus between public law reform and health; human rights impact of climate change on Indigenous communities. =International law= * Focusing on Indigenous legal issues in international law; United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Indigenous peoples advocacy at the UN; UN human rights treaties, treaty bodies and indigenous specific jurisprudence; Convention on the Rights of the Child and Indigenous children; Indigenous peoples, trade and WTO; Indigenous peoples and WIPO. =Women and Australian democracy= * A study of how Indigenous women fare in contemporary democracies, in particular Aboriginal women in Australian democracy; Indigenous women's issues and Australian public institutions; Aboriginal women, human rights and aboriginal law; Indigenous women and the right to self-determination; Indigenous women and extra-parliamentary representative structures.

It has an orangish-yellow cap with yellowish-orange patches or warts, a yellowish-orange annulus, and a white to orange stem. Common and widespread throughout eastern North America, Amanita flavoconia grows on the ground in broad-leaved and mixed forests, especially in mycorrhizal association with hemlock. Taxonomy Amanita flavoconia was first described by American naturalist George Francis Atkinson in 1902, based on a specimen he found in woods north of Fall Creek, Cayuga Lake Basin, New York. Jean-Edouard Gilbert placed it in Amplariella, in 1941, while in 1948 William Alphonso Murrill thought that it belonged best in Venenarius; both of these segregate genera have been folded back into Amanita. The specific epithet flavoconia means yellowish and conical. Its common names include \\"yellow patches\\", \\"yellow wart\\", \\"orange Amanita\\", or \\"yellow-dust Amanita\\". Description The cap is initially ovoid in shape, but in maturity becomes convex and eventually flattened. Orange to bright yellow-orange in color, it reaches diameters of . Young specimens are covered with chrome yellow warts that may be easily rubbed off or washed away with rain.Closeup of cap surface The cap surface is smooth and sticky (viscid) beneath the warts; the edge of the cap is striate, reflecting the arrangement of the gills underneath. The flesh is white. The gills are barely free from the stem, and packed close together. They are white or tinged yellow on the edges, and initially covered with a yellowish partial veil. The stem is typically long by thick, equal or slightly tapered upward from a small rounded bulb at the base. Its color may range from white to yellowish orange, and the surface may be smooth, or covered with small flakes. The base of the stem usually has chrome yellow flakes of universal veil material adhering loosely to the bulb, or in the soil around the base. The partial veil leaves a skirt-like ring, (annulus) on the upper stem. The spore print of A. flavoconia is white. Campbell and Petersen published a detailed description of the characteristics of A. flavoconia grown in culture. In the era prior to the commonplace use of DNA analysis and phylogenetics, cultural characters were often used to help provide additional taxonomic information; they found considerable variability between different isolates. Two variants have been reported from Colombia, collected from Quercus humboldtii forests: A. flavoconia var. sinapicolor and var. inquinata. As the edibility of this species is unknown, it should not be consumed. =Microscopic features= The spores are elliptical, smooth, and have dimensions of 7‚Äì9 by 5‚Äì8 Œºm. They are hyaline (translucent), and amyloid, meaning that they absorb the iodine stain in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are up to 35‚Äì43 Œºm long by 4‚Äì12 Œºm, and each have four sterigmata, extensions that hold the spores. The outer layer, or cuticle of the cap (known technically as the pileipellis) is made of filamentous interwoven gelatinized hyphae, with diameters between 3 and 7 Œºm. Habitat and distribution bottom A common mycorrhizal mushroom, Amanita flavoconia grows solitary or in groups on the ground in the summer to the fall, in broad-leaved and mixed woods. Noted for preferring hemlock, it is also associated with high elevation red spruce forests. In North America, Amanita flavoconia has a wide distribution and has been collected from several locations, including Ontario, Canada; the United States (Iowa) and Mexico. It has been described as \\"of the most common and widespread species of Amanita in eastern North America.\\" =Similar species= This species has often been confused with A. muscaria, some subspecies of which are also orange-colored. It also bears some resemblance to A. frostiana and A. flavorubescens. One 1982 study concluded that a \\"large majority\\" of herbarium specimens labeled as A. frostiana were actually A. flavoconia. The use of microscopic features is necessary to distinguish clearly among the species: A. flavoconia has elliptic, amyloid spores, while A. frostiana has round, non-amyloid spores; A. muscaria has nonamyloid, elliptic spores. In the field, A. flavorubescens can usually be distinguished by its yellow cap color.

Life He was the son of the Revd William Butts, rector of Hartest, near Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk. He was educated at the grammar school at Bury, and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated as B.A. 1707, M.A. 1711, and D.D. 1728. As an undergraduate he was famous as a boxer and football player. After his ordination he served as curate of Thurlow, and in 1703 was chosen one of the preachers of Bury. Here he rendered political services to the Hervey family. He was a party agent, useful in elections to John, Lord Hervey, son of John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, Lord Privy Seal in Sir Robert Waipole's administration. In 1717 Butts was appointed by Lord Bristol to the family living of Ickworth, and in 1728 he became chaplain to George II, receiving his degree of D.D. at the same time by royal mandate. Three years later, on 6 February 1731, he was appointed dean of Norwich, retaining the living of Ickworth in commendam, till his succession to the bishopric on 20 January 1733. He was consecrated by Bishop Edmund Gibson of London, at Bow Church, 25 February. A competent but unpopular bishop, he was translated to the see of Ely in 1638, but spent little time there. During the latter years of his life Butts was crippled with gout. He died at Ely House, Holborn, 26 January 1748, and was buried in the south aisle of the choir of Ely Cathedral, under a marble monument. He published little. Family Butts was twice married. His first wife was Miss Elizabeth Eyton, who died of consumption in 1734, at the age of forty-four, leaving two sons and five daughters. She was buried in the chapel of the bishop's palace at Norwich. He re-married to the daughter of the Revd Mr Reynolds of Bury, aged 23, by whom he had six more daughters. After his death in 1753, she then took as her second husband George Green, the receiver of the late bishop's rents, but they separated, and Mrs Green retired to Chichester, where she died 3 December 1781, at the age of sixty-nine.

It was first described by Robert Frucht in 1939. The Frucht graph is a pancyclic Halin graph with chromatic number 3, chromatic index 3, radius 3, and diameter 4. As with every Halin graph, the Frucht graph is polyhedral (planar and 3-vertex- connected) and Hamiltonian, with girth 3. Its independence number is 5. The Frucht graph can be constructed from the LCF notation: [‚àí5,‚àí2,‚àí4,2,5,‚àí2,2,5,‚àí2,‚àí5,4,2]. Algebraic properties The Frucht graph is one of the five smallest cubic graphs possessing only a single graph automorphism, the identity (that is, every vertex can be distinguished topologically from every other vertex). Such graphs are called asymmetric (or identity) graphs. Frucht's theorem states that any group can be realized as the group of symmetries of a graph,. and a strengthening of this theorem also due to Frucht states that any group can be realized as the symmetries of a 3-regular graph;. the Frucht graph provides an example of this realization for the trivial group. The characteristic polynomial of the Frucht graph is (x-3) (x-2) x (x+1) (x+2) (x^3+x^2-2 x-1) (x^4+x^3-6 x^2-5 x+4).

First released as a single in June 1967 in the UK and US, it was later added to their second studio album Disraeli Gears. The song features Eric Clapton on lead vocals rather than the usual lead by Jack Bruce. The single peaked at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart in July of that same year. In the UK, it was the last Cream single to be released by Reaction Records. Background In April 1967, during their first trip to New York, Cream recorded a song called \\"Lawdy Mama\\" with Ahmet Ertegun at Atlantic Studios, at the beginning of the sessions for what would become the Disraeli Gears album. The band cut two versions of the song, the first a typical blues shuffle, and the second converted to straight time in a more rock 'n' roll style (both versions can be heard on the Those Were the Days collection). Producer Felix Pappalardi took the tape of the second version of \\"Lawdy Mama\\" and, with help from his wife Gail Collins, transformed the song into \\"Strange Brew\\" which according to Eric Clapton \\"created a pop song without completely destroying the original groove.\\"\\"The making of... Cream's Strange Brew\\" - Total Guitar Magazine - 14 August 2012. One journalist noted that Clapton at this stage was employing Albert King guitar stylings; and that both \\"Strange Brew\\" and another Cream track, \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\", \\"were practically Albert King parodies\\". Clapton performs lead vocals on the song in a falsetto style. It was the first Cream single on which he sang lead. Unlike the group's previous single, \\"I Feel Free\\", no promotional video was made for the song, but the band mimed to it on television on the German program Beat Club on 19 May 1967. Chart history The song \\"Strange Brew\\" first appeared on the UK Singles Chart on 10 June 1967 at No. 43. It hit its highest position on 15 July at No. 17, and then left the charts on 5 August at No. 35, having spent a total of nine weeks on the chart.

Gosu Cave is listed as the country's \\"Natural Monument No. 256\\". \\"Gosu\\" means \\"field of tall reeds,\\" and comes from the fact that the area used to be filled with fields of tall grasses. After the cave was discovered in the early 1970s, rough stone instruments were excavated from the cave's entrance, showing that this used to be a home to prehistoric people.  Features of the cave  The cave, 1,300 m/4,264 ft deep, is inhabited by 25 species of insects and animals. About 120 different stalactites and stalagmites are found here. Some of the formations resemble animals or human figures, such as Lion Rock, Octopus Rock, Eagle Rock, and even the Virgin Mary Rock. The Lion Rock is said to be the guardian of the cave. While it has an entire length of 5.4 km/17,716 ft, visitors are limited to exploring up to 1.7 km/5,577 ft of the cave. The main branch of Gosu Cave is 1,200 m/3,937 ft long. It features a variety of spectacular speleothems: stalactites, stalagmites, columns, cave coral, cave pearls, cave shields, draperies, and aragonite crystals. The main chamber has a series of majestic 10m/33 ft long stalactites.  Tourism  The cave is open to the public every day year-round, and gets the most visitors on hot summer days; the interior of the cave is cool, being a steady 15 ¬∞C/59 ¬∞F year-round, and in winter gloves are recommended for holding the cool metal railings. A 1.7 km/5,577 ft length of twisting, turning limestone caverns have been outfitted with metal walkways, becoming quite narrow at some points, and subdued lighting. The vertical height of the walkways is 50 m/164 ft.

Life Front page of Decretum tripartitum Juraj Zrinski had 1574 in Nedeli≈°ƒáe printed He was the son of Croatian Ban (viceroy) Nikola IV Zrinski (*1508 - ‚Ä†1566.), the hero of Szigetvar, and his wife Katarina Zrinski n√©e Frankopan (married 1543, died 1561.), a Croatian countess. From his father he inherited a large number of estates, among which was the Meƒëimurje County, the northernmost part of Croatia, with the large and strongly fortified ƒåakovec castle. He succeeded his father at the royal position of the Master of the treasury in the Kingdom of Hungary and Croatia, which held until his death. In the time of growing and spreading Protestantism, Zrinski accepted it and adducted the Lutheran pastors to replace the Catholic priests in Croatian parishes, which caused indignation and revolt of the people. On the other hand, his contribution was the introduction of book printing into northern Croatia. In the early 1570s he invited an Austrian printer and grafic expert named Rudolf Hoffhalter to found a printing office in Nedeli≈°ƒáe, a village next to ƒåakovec. Many publications were printed there in the next couple of years (probably until 1586), among which was the famous juristic book Decretum tripartitum of the publisher Ivanu≈° Pergo≈°iƒá, the first book ever in Croatian Kajkavian dialect, printed in 1574. Like his ancestors and descendants, Zrinski took part in battles against the Ottomans, who conquered most of Croatia, and he often carried out the sudden attacks to the hinterland of the enemy in order to slow down or stop them from further conquests. On May 29, 1579, he granted privileges to the inhabitants of the ƒåakovec fortress and its suburbs. This was the starting point for ƒåakovec to become a free market town and the date is celebrated today as ƒåakovec City Day. Juraj IV Zrinski was married twice with ladies from Arco family of Tyrol and Stubenberg family of Styria, with whom had four children. His sons Nikola VI and Juraj V (future Croatian Ban) succeeded him when he died in 1603. He was buried in Pauline monastery of Sveta Jelena (St. Helen) near ƒåakovec, next to the grave where the head of his famous father had been buried 37 years before.

In August 2011, Lord wrote an article in The American Spectator criticizing Texas Republican Congressman Ron Paul and the views of some of his supporters. The article sparked considerable debate within the conservative movement. In March 2016, during a Super Tuesday election night on CNN, an argument ensued for several minutes between Lord and a CNN contributor, Van Jones, about Lord's defense of Donald Trump. The argument came about when a fellow contributor, conservative commentator S. E. Cupp, accused Trump of \\"crazy, dog whistle policy proposals\\", that she believed he had made to attract prejudiced voters, and because Trump had hesitated to disavow KKK member David Duke in a CNN interview the previous weekend. Lord responded that the KKK many decades earlier had supported Democrats so the KKK was therefore left wing. He accused those who raised these worries of dividing Americans by race. Van Jones questioned the relevance of the first point and declared the second point \\"absurd\\". Lord responded that \\"history matters\\", that Democrats continue to divide citizens by race today and that doing so is \\"morally wrong\\". In April 2017, on a CNN discussion program hosted by Don Lemon and featuring three other panelists including CNN commentator Symone Sanders, Lord maintained, as he had on an earlier CNN program, that President Donald Trump was the \\"Martin Luther King\\" of health care, explicitly comparing and equating Trump tactics to King tactics. This infuriated both Lemon and Sanders. Lemon ended the program after a few more minutes of discussion. CNN fired Lord on August 10, 2017, after he tweeted \\"Sieg Heil!\\" to Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, suggesting Carusone was a fascist. CNN subsequently filled Lord's role as a pro-Trump contributor with Missouri politician Ed Martin.

She was also the first Indian director of Christian Medical College and Hospital at Vellore.The legacy of Hilda Lazarus (Christian Medical College and Hospital) (Biography), International Bulletin of Missionary Research, 1 October 2006. Early life Hilda was born on 23 January 1890 in Visakhapatnam in southern India. Her grandparents converted to Christianity in the early 19th century, abandoning their Brahmin identity. She was one of nine surviving children born to Eliza and Daniel Lazarus. Her father was a highly regarded Christian educator and author. She joined CBM high school for her primary education. Medical training At the Madras University Lazarus completed a B.A. before obtaining her medical degree from the Madras Medical College and winning a gold medal for outstanding work in Midwifery. She later went to England to qualify for a medical degree and spent many years for several courses in medicine. In the United Kingdom, she passed medical examinations in London and Dublin. She obtained membership in the Royal College of Surgeons and a specialization in obstetrics and gynecology. She was appointed to the Women's Medical Service (WMS) in India, the first Indian woman to obtain such an appointment. She was in government medical service from 1917 to 1947. Return to India Lazarus entered her career with the WMS by serving briefly at Lady Hardinge Medical College and Hospital, New Delhi. Established under government auspices in 1916 as the only fully professional medical college in India concerned exclusively with the training of women, Lady Hardinge was open to qualified students from all religious backgrounds. Lady Hardinge Medical College was thus unique within India, and it was to this institution that Lazarus returned in triumph in 1940 as its first Indian principal. During the years that intervened, she worked in various parts of India, superintending hospitals, training nurses and midwives, and taking other steps to improve the quality of medical services for women and children. In addition to broadening her professional horizons and areas of expertise, these years also led her to acquire facility in several new Indian languages in addition to the Telugu and Sanskrit that she had learned in childhood, along with English. She wrote a book based on her experiences in England and served as the Director of Vellore Medical College between 1948 and 1954 and Chief Medical Officer at the Vellore hospital.Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie and Joy Harvey, eds., The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: L-Z, p. 757 She served for some time in the Government General Hospital, Madras.

It is related to the pepper plant. It grows north from Mount Dromedary in southern New South Wales to tropical Queensland. First described by Dutch botanist Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel in 1866, its specific name pertains to its location in New Holland (Australia). The giant pepper vine is a vigorous and rapid-growing climbing plant with stems which become woody and covered in rough, grey bark. At its greatest development, the woody vine stem can be thick at the base, and may reach 30‚Äì40 metres in length. Curtains of its leaves may sometimes be seen suspended from large rainforest trees. When the in the juvenile stage, its leaves are thin and ovate, measuring roughly 8 cm by 8 cm). Also ovate, mature leaves ‚Äî referred to as \\"sun leaves\\" ‚Äî are thicker and larger. They are a deep green color with visible veins, and measure approximately 12 cm by 8 cm. The small, cream-colored flowers of the giant pepper vine occur from April to August. Male flowers are arranged on a cylindrical spike, while female ones are on a more ovular one ‚Äî both male and female flowers occur on a single given plant. Flowering is followed by a 0.5 cm, oval-shaped, red, fleshy drupe, which provides food to rainforest wildlife.

The current Rome tram system is a leftover from what once was the largest tram system in Italy. With its fragmented structure, it does not currently function as a backbone of the city's public transport. The system is owned and operated by Azienda Tranvie e Autobus del Comune di Roma (ATAC SpA).Webb, Mary (ed.) (2010). Jane‚Äôs Urban Transport Systems 2010‚Äì2011, p. 195. Coulsdon, Surrey (UK): Jane's Information Group. . Network The key node of the tram network in Rome is Porta Maggiore, where four out of six lines meet (3, 5, 14 and 19), as well as the Rome-Giardinetti railway. This is about 1 km east of Roma Termini railway station, and not connected to the metro network. The following lines currently run: ; 2 Piazzale Flaminio ‚Üî Piazza Mancini This short line runs through the Flaminio neighbourhood, connecting at Piazzale Flaminio (near the Porta del Popolo) with Line A and the Rome-Viterbo railway line. Some runs of the 2 on weekdays (marked as 2/) run from Piazza Mancini to Piazza Risorgimento, running with the 19 across the Tevere to the Vatican. ; 3 Piazza Thorvaldsen (in the Villa Borghese) ‚Üî Trastevere railway station. Partially reopened on 27 August 2012. This is the longest line after line 19, going round the city centre in a wide arc from north via east to south-west. At the western endpoint Trastevere railway station, this line connects with the Regional railways (lines 1, 3 and 5), while connections with Metro A are at Manzoni and San Giovanni. There are four connections with metro Line B: one at Policlinico, and three on the stretch Piramide - Circo Massimo (Rome Metro) - Colosseo, where line 3 follows Metro B on the surface. The remainder of the line from the Roma Trastevere railway station to Piazzale Ostiense continued until 2016 to be served by a substitute bus service, the 3B, pending the completion of infrastructural works. On August 8th, 2016, the tram service was restored on this last segment. Line 3 now runs on its entire original route.http://www.atac.roma.it/page.asp?r=16016&p;=159 ; 5 Roma Termini railway station ‚Üî Piazza dei Gerani. This line runs east from Termini railway station. It connects with line A at Termini metro station, Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II and Manzoni. ; 8 Piazza Venezia ‚Üî Via del Casaletto. Line 8 is the newest line of the system, always running with modern stock. It also reaches furthest into the historic city centre, connecting it with Trastevere railway station. Work on an extension began on June 19, 2012 and the new terminus, located in piazza Venezia, opened on June 6, 2013. ; 14 Stazione Termini ‚Üî Viale Palmiro Togliatti This line mostly follows the route of line 5, but with a different eastern terminus. ; 19 Piazza Risorgimento ‚Üî Piazza dei Gerani. This line connects the Vatican with the rest of the tram network, following the route of first line 3, and then line 5. It connects with the metro at Ottaviano ‚Äì San Pietro ‚Äì Musei Vaticani, Lepanto (Rome Metro) (both Line A) and Policlinico (line B). Line 19 is the longest line, connecting with all other tram lines, except for line 8. History Rome had horse buses after 1845, when pope Gregory XVI authorized a line from Piazza Venezia to the Basilica di San Paolo fuori le mura to transport pilgrims. This first line did not run according to a timetable; trams left when they were full. Horse trams arrived in 1877, connecting Piazzale Flaminio with the Ponte Milvio, the current line 2. In 1895, electric trams arrived, connecting Termini station to Piazza San Silvestro. By 1904, all horse tram lines had been electrified ‚Äì the Ponte Milvio tram last. By 1905, a total of 17 tram lines was operating, using 144 electric vehicles, with a number of horse-drawn trams functioning as backup. After a few years of competition with the incumbent company SRTO, in 1929, government-controlled company ATAG (Azienda Tranvie Autobus del Governo di Roma) took over the whole network, and by the end of that year, the network had reached its largest extent: no fewer than 59 lines along 140 km of track. As many lines shared parts of their routes, a large reorganization took place in 1930: from then on, two circular lines functioned alongside 24 radial lines, which all started out from the inner ring (the 'black ring'), and crossed the outer ring (the 'red ring'). Within the inner ring, all tram lines were cancelled and substituted by autobuses. 40 kilometers of tracks were dismantled, and part of the older rolling stock was demolished. After the Second World War, the operating company changed its name to ATAC (Azienda Tranvie ed Autobus del Comune di Roma), but the network kept shrinking. The inner ring was deactivated in 1959; the outer ring only ran in one direction from that year until reconstruction in 1975. The connection Piazzale Flaminio- Ponte Milvio was cancelled in 1960 and reconstructed in 1983 (northern part) and 1990 (southern part). Line 8 was opened in 1998. There are plans to open more lines, including connections from the current northern terminus of line 8 to Termini, and a line from the same terminus towards the Vatican.

The prototype, delivered in 1942 and numbered 7001, operated briefly and was destroyed in the bombing of Rome on July 19, 1943. The order was confirmed, however, and the delivery of 50 cars (7003‚Äì7099, 7001) occurred between 1948 and 1949. These cars, which have undergone an operation for modernization in the 1980s, are still in operation in Rome, with the exception of 7073 and 7093 that were recently scrapped. Number 7021 has been transformed into \\"Ristotram\\" (restaurant car). A further order of eight similar trams was made in 1953 for STEFER suburban network(7101‚Äì7115, odd numbers only). These were later modernized by ATAC at the Viberti workshops. =SOCIMI T8000 (9001-9041)= SOCIMI tram 9006 at Piazza Risorgimento in 2010 33 articulated double-ended low-floor tramcars (9001-9033) were delivered in 1990 and 1991 by SOCIMI in Milan. These trams are fitted with a 2-axle bogies at both ends, and small wheels in the centre of the car (wheel arrangement Bo'2'Bo'), thus allowing a 70% low floor. Since SOCIMI went broke 27 of the 60 cars on order were not built at the time, but in 2003 and 2004 eight additional cars (9034-9041) entered service, assembled from spare parts salvaged from the dissolved SOCIMI works. =Cityway I (9101‚Äì9128)= These double-articulated trams were ordered from Cityway Fiat Railway in 1998 to mark the opening of line 8. 28 trams were ordered. 70% of its length is low-floor; raised floor sections are located at the ends. The entire train measures 31 meters. One innovation introduced was the air conditioning system. Currently they are in regular operation on lines 2 and 8. =Cityway 2 (9201‚Äì9252)= In 1999, another 52 articulated trams were ordered from Fiat-Alstom, following the new trend of 100% low-floor trams. The tram is made up of four sections mounted on separate trucks, and alternate with three suspended sections. The length is 33 meters. The cars 9217 and 9218 are prototypes which never entered into service, which had additional articulated sections, forming a vehicle of 41.45 meters in length, with 9 sections and 5 trucks. These trams are used only for line 8. Trams in film In the course of time, hundreds of films have been filmed in Rome, partly due to the presence of the studios at Cinecitt√†. Trams feature in some of them: * Roma citt√† aperta, 1945 * Ladri di biciclette, 1948 * Umberto D., 1949 * I soliti ignoti, 1956 * Il ferroviere, 1957 * Tot√≤ e Marcellino, 1958 * Roma, 1970 * Io, Chiara e lo scuro, 1982 * Intervista, 1987 * Tre uomini e una gamba, 1997 The tramway line to Cinecitt√† is credited to have had a crucial role in the neorealist film-making, as directors drew ideas for subjects while travelling with people from working classes.

Rob MacGregor, the author of this book, also wrote five of the other Indiana Jones books for Bantam. It was published January 1, 1991 and was followed by Indiana Jones and the Dance of the Giants. Plot summary After a brief flashback to 1920, with a glimpse of Indiana Jones as a college student in Chicago, the novel moves to its main setting. The year is 1922. Indy is a graduate student in Paris, studying linguistics and Greek archaeology. Although his greater talent currently seems to be for the former, he begins to wonder if he might be better suited for a different career after he receives a surprising invitation from his professor. Following an archaeology lecture to her class on the Greek city of Delphi, Professor Dorian Belecamus announces that she will be leaving the university for the rest of the semester in order to return to Delphi to oversee the recovery of an archaeological find, discovered recently in the wake of an earthquake in the region. After class, to Indy's surprise, she privately invites him to join her on the journey as her assistant, telling him that he is her best student and that she feels he could be very helpful on the expedition. After some consideration, Indy decides to accept the professor's offer in the hopes that assisting in such an exciting undertaking may very well lead him to a more intriguing and adventurous career than world of linguistics may have to offer. He, of course, has no idea exactly how true those ideas will prove to be as he embarks on a journey filled with mysterious figures, deceptive intentions and a lot more waiting for him Delphi than he ever expected.  Characters  *Henry Jones Jr. (a.k.a. Indiana Jones) An American student attending graduate school in Paris. He has vast knowledge in the fields of linguistics and mythology, but, after being invited, by his professor, to help unearth a possibly significant historical find in an ancient Greek temple, he starts to wonder if he might find a career in archaeology to be more his speed. *Professor Dorian Belecamus A professor of Greek archaeology, teaching in Paris. She is somewhat of an enigma to Indy and becomes even more so when she announces to her class that she will be leaving for the remainder of the semester to return to Delphi on an archaeology expedition and later, privately, invites Mr. Jones to join her. *Professor Ted Conrad Indy's history Professor and friend from Chicago. *Jack Shannon Indy's best friend, fellow college classmate and a jazz musician from Chicago. *Colonel Alexander Mandraki A shadowy figure from Professor Belecamus' past, with whom she is still apparently very close.

He is not pleased at the arrival of foreigners in Delphi, especially Indiana Jones. *Grigoris Son of Panos. He is his father's right hand as they pursue their goals surrounding the events in Delphi. *Stephanos Doumas He is the head of archaeology in Delphi and is in charge of the site at the temple until Professor Belecamus arrives. *Nikos a teenage desk clerk at the Delphi Hotel, as well as the son of the owner.

The Welsh Rugby Union, believed that Jones was taking payment for playing and declared him a professional player, which would prevent him playing under the union code for the rest of his career. Jones challenged the decision and was later reinstated as an amateur. Jones won just a single cap for Wales, and at the time has returned to Wales and was playing rugby for Aberavon, becoming the third player to win a cap whilst representing the club after Dan Jones and Alfred Brice. Jones' international debut was in the opening game of the 1901 Home Nations Championship, played at the Cardiff Arms Park against England. Jones, the only new cap in the team that day, was brought in as a replacement for Lou Phillips, and was partnered at half-back with Newport's Llewellyn Lloyd.

It was built on the site of an earlier building, known as Barmore, and has been in use as a hotel since 1950. History The original house of Barmore was constructed by the MacAlister family, who held nearby Tarbert Castle as tenants of the Duke of Argyll. They built the new house in the early 18th century, as the castle was deteriorating, though this led in 1762 to a lawsuit brought by the Duke against the MacAlister laird for neglect. Prior to this, Archibald Campbell, Sheriff of Argyll, had purchased the Barmore estate from Archibald MacAlister of Tarback in 1746. The present castle was commissioned by John Campbell (1788-1857), grandson of John Campbell, Lord Stonefield (1720‚Äì1801), and designed by Edinburgh architect William Henry Playfair. It was completed in 1837, replacing the earlier Barmore. Playfair designed a number of buildings in the grounds, including bridges and a folly, and may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Campbell planted a number of species of Rhododendron and Magnolia, using seeds recently acquired on botanical expeditions by Archibald Campbell (his cousin) and Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1850. The plant collections were maintained and enhanced by later generations of Campbells, who also had gardens at Achnacloich near Connel. In 1948 the Campbells sold Stonefield, and it opened as a hotel in 1950. The castle is a category B listed building. The grounds of the house are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, as an \\"important example of a 'west coast' woodland estate landscape\\" of national importance, with an outstanding plant collection.

She took the \\"Pankhursts\\" as role models and after hearing of the \\"Brown Women\\" she organised marches to draw attention to the suffrage cause. She was known as \\"General Jones\\" because of her following.  Early life and education  Jones was born in Cold Spring Harbor, New York. Her mother was Mary Elizabeth Jones, who came from a wealthy upper-class family, the Joneses. Her father was Dr. Oliver Livingston Jones Sr. When Rosalie's mother died in 1918 of Spanish Flu, her son inherited the family Manor, Jones Manor. Yet after many years of fighting over the house and accusations of mistreatment of the Manor, Rosalie finally inherited the Manor for herself. Rosalie and her mother had very different views about women's suffrage. Where Mary Elizabeth was a part of the New York State Anti-Suffrage Associations, Rosalie was an active suffragist and Nassau County President of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. Jones received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Adelphi College in Brooklyn, then attended Brooklyn Law School. She earned her LL. B degree from George Washington College of Law. She completed two different theses, \\"The Labor Party in England\\" and The American Standard of Living and World Cooperation.  Career  Jones, circa 1910-1915 Jessie Stubbs and Ida Craft, circa 1912-1913 Jones was influenced in her beliefs about women's role in society from the \\"Pankhursts,\\" who were British suffragettes. She organised marches similar to the \\"Brown Women\\" march from Edinburgh to London some months before. Some of her most famous marches include her march to Albany, New York in December 1912, and the march to Washington D.C. in February 1913. During her famous march from Manhattan, New York to Albany, New York, she led over 200 women over 175 miles in thirteen days. Even though her mother was an anti-suffragist, Rosalie went against her mother's wishes to take part in these marches. In early 1913, General Rosalie Jones and her \\"pilgrims\\", as they were called, planned to reach the Capitol of the United States. Reports say that there were preparations made for the 225 women for their welcome and even a royal reception. One pilgrim, Miss Constance Leupp, arrived days earlier and denied the stories about the hardships the marchers suffered through. She was quoted, \\"[On the march] they had 'loads of fun'.\\" General Genevieve Wilmsatt, chief of the cavalry brigade, would lead her own horsewomen to meet General Jones with her pilgrims. At Laurel, Maryland, Jones spent the night during the march. It was here where Genevieve officially met Jones and escorted them into the city. Jones was known to her army of warriors as \\"General Jones\\" and with good reason. Jones believed in fighting a strong battle and was not afraid to do something dramatic to get her point across. Her marches might not have been as famous as the protest Alice Paul did, but Jones was a strong leader. Her marches eventually led to the passage of the 19th Amendment on June 4, 1919 and then the ratification of the amendment on August 18, 1920. In the years after her suffrage protests, Jones still continued to fight for what she believed in. In 1925, she protested Governor Alfred E. Smith and demanded he remove Robert Moses as President of the Long Island Park Commission for appropriation of people's property without fair warning. With little support, Jones returned to her Long Island home, where she lived by herself. For the next years, Jones was busy breaking traditions, raising goats on her property, and fighting with her neighbors and relatives. Her relationship with her family was always strained and almost never pleasant.  Personal life  On March 15, 1927, Jones married Clarence Dill, a Washington United States Senator. This marriage ended in divorce, which was widely publicized. Dill accused her of being an appalling wife and housekeeper and of embarrassing him constantly. After her divorce, Jones ran unsuccessfully for congressional office in November 1936 as a Democrat. Jones died on January 12, 1978, and her ashes were scattered outside her mother's tomb at St. John Episcopal Church in Cold Spring Harbor, New York.

He served as Bishop of Richmond from 1850 until his death in 1872. Biography The oldest of ten children, John McGill was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to James and Lavinia (n√©e Dougherty) McGill, who immigrated to the United States from County Donegal, Ireland, shortly after their marriage. Following the birth of their sixth child, his parents moved the family to Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1819. At age eleven McGill entered St. Joseph's College, where he studied the classics and graduated in 1828 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. After studying law under Charles A. Wickliffe, he practiced in New Orleans for six months before returning to Kentucky to work with Thomas Chilton. He later abandoned his legal career to embrace the ecclesiastical state, completing his theological studies at St. Thomas' Seminary in Bardstown and at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. McGill was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John David, P.S.S., on June 13, 1835. He then served as an assistant priest at St. Peter's Church in Lexington and at Assumption Cathedral in Louisville. In 1839 he became editor of the Catholic Advocate, which he used to attack Protestantism. He also served as pastor of St. Louis' Church in Louisville. On July 23, 1850, McGill was appointed the third Bishop of Richmond, Virginia, by Pope Pius IX. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 10 from Archbishop Peter Richard Kenrick, with Bishops Richard Pius Miles, O.P., and Martin John Spalding serving as co-consecrators. At the time of McGill's arrival in Richmond the following December, the diocese had 7,000 Catholics, eight priests, and 10 churches. He went to Rome in 1854 to be present at the definition of the Immaculate Conception, and convened the first diocesan synod in 1855. During his tenure, Virginia was devastated by yellow fever and cholera epidemics, as well as the Civil War. During the war McGill wrote, \\"The True Church Indicated to the Inquirer\\" and \\"Our Faith, the Victory\\", republished as \\"The Creed of Catholics\\". He also attended the First Vatican Council from 1869 to 1870, where he supported papal infallibility. The Bishop later died at Richmond, aged 62.

Yours was the first concert residency by American singer Beyonc√©. It was held four consecutive nights in July and August 2009 in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The residency was held at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas in Las Vegas, Nevada. Beyonc√© performed over thirty songs backed by an orchestra and her all-female band, the Suga Mamas, to an audience of 1,500. The residency was deemed \\"an intimate encounter\\" as Beyonc√© portrayed a more raw and uninhibited show versus her previous concert performances. The concept of the shows revolves around Beyonc√©'s recording career. I Am... Yours received positive response from music critics who praised the intimate performances and Beyonc√©'s vocals as well as the jazz, funk and orchestral arrangements of the songs. The success of I Am... Yours has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyonc√© to return as a residency act. A double disc CD and DVD, I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas, was released in November 2009, featuring the performance recorded on August 2, 2009. It contained the full concert, a behind-the-scenes feature, along with an audio CD of the concert. I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas was aired on several TV Networks as a special. Background and development The concerts were held at the Encore Theater in Wynn Las Vegas to a standing-audience. When Beyonc√©'s I Am... Tour (2009‚Äì2010), was announced in 2008 by Entertainment Weekly, the article mentioned Beyonc√© would perform a week-long Las Vegas showcase. As tour dates were announced, it was later revealed that Beyonc√© would perform four shows in Las Vegas. The concerts were held at the Encore Theatre in Las Vegas, Nevada to a standing room-only audience of 1,500. Tickets for the first three shows were sold out after they were made available, but the ones for the fourth night were sold slowly with Las Vegas Sun reporting that ninety percent of the tickets were sold. The prices for the tickets were from $250 to $1,000. According to Beyonc√©, the show is an \\"unplugged\\" version of her normal concerts; she removed all the elaborate costumes and theatrics of her latest tour and performed with her band, Suga Mama, and a small team of dancers. Regarding the concerts, she told ABC News, > \\"I've always wanted to perform in Las Vegas, I've always wanted to do my own > show there, because a lot of the icons that I look up to had amazing shows > in Las Vegas. I thought if I'm going to have my own Las Vegas show, it has > to be right and it has to have heart and soul and it has to be something > memorable... My whole objective here is for people to see what they don't > get to see. Just give me my band, give me a stage, some cool smoke and > lights and you see the sweat, you see the pain, you see the love, you see > the soul and it's about music.\\" During the documentary, \\"What Happens in Vegas...\\", Beyonc√© stated that when the idea of a Vegas show was presented to her, she wanted the show to be a complete 180 from her current tour. Also, she did not want it to be the typical Las Vegas showcase. She wanted to remove the theatrics and \\"consciously show that I don't need any of that stuff. Just give me my band, a stage and some cool smoke and lights.\\" Beyonc√© and her production quickly organized the show in seven days, based on a script provided by filmmaker Matthew Dickens. She often rehearsed during sound checks of her 2009 tour. The concept of the shows revolves around Beyonc√©'s recording career, from her early childhood beginnings to the star she is today. She revealed, \\"In the beginning, I'm gonna start out, sing and make it about my songwriting, my arrangements, my band and my love for music. Then, I'm gonna tell my story. This way, I can sing all of the hit songs, the songs that people want. But, it's a deeper meaning... these songs meant more than just the chorus that's catchy... it's my life.\\" Since the show was created last minute, there were many changes. Originally, the set list included, \\"Ego\\", \\"At Last\\", \\"Listen\\", \\"Ring the Alarm\\", and \\"Upgrade U\\". These songs were later removed from the set list and a new one was added with additional instruments. The success of the show has led Wynn Resorts to ask Beyonc√© to return as a residency act. About the show=Fashion and stage= The stage contained wind machines, lasers, arena lighting, a teleprompter on the back and a retro, mood-lit platform during the performances of the songs. According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, \\"the stagecraft... keeps a viewer at a worshipful remove\\". During a statement before the show, Beyonc√© revealed, \\"We have designed an elegant and beautiful stage and we will have new costumes that are being designed especially for this show.\\" Beyonc√© is accompanied by an orchestra and her 18-member all-female band on stage \\"whose satin interpretations pump lush over pomp\\" according to Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post. She is also backed by several dancers during the performances of several songs and also appears alone during some performances. The choreography for the show was developed by Beyonc√©'s collaborator Frank Jr. Gatson. The set list included performances of over thirty songs, both from Beyonc√©'s solo career and as part of the girl group Destiny's Child. During the show, one major costume change was made. Beyonc√© first appeared in beaded Jean Paul Gaultier couture and then in a cape-like jacket for the first half of the show. Both pieces were worn on top of a figure-flaunting grey bodysuit. For the second part, Beyonc√© traded the bodysuit for a black sequined, bathing suit-like number. Several costumes for the stage during the show were also designed by Beyonc√©'s mother Tina Knowles, who was her designer for many years. Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly praised the costumes of the show, saying that Beyonc√© \\"sparkled from beginning to end\\". She noted that the first costume \\"left little to the imagination\\" while the second one \\"left no curve unnoticed\\". =Show synopsis= The show begins with a narrator introducing Beyonc√© to the audience. She appears from the back of the theater performing \\"Hello\\". She greets the audience and makes her way towards the stage as she continues to perform. At the stage, Beyonc√© sings \\"Halo\\". Next, she performs \\"Irreplaceable\\" and interacts with the audience. She later moves into an acoustic medley, performing a down-tempo version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\", \\"Dangerously in Love 2\\" and \\"Sweet Love\\" (originally recorded by Anita Baker). The medley leads into \\"If I Were a Boy\\" (which contains excerpts from \\"You Oughta Know\\") and \\"Scared of Lonely\\". The show continues with a performance of \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\", intertwined with excerpts from \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" (originally recorded by Prince), \\"Satellites\\", and \\"Resentment\\". The first act concludes with Beyonc√© performing a jazz-fused \\"D√©j√† Vu\\". Before the next act begins, three dancers appear and perform a tap sequence called \\"Bebop\\". Beyonc√© begins the second act by telling the story of her career, starting from when she was nine years old when she auditioned for the talent show Star Search to her then-latest album I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyonc√© highlights that one of the first songs she remembers learning was Michael Jackson's \\"I Wanna Be Where You Are\\". She continues with a medley of Destiny's Child's hits songs, including \\"No No No\\", \\"Bug a Boo\\", \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\", and \\"Say My Name\\" whilst in between the songs, she talks about the story behind them. The medley leads into \\"Work It Out\\" and \\"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\\", as she now begins to talk about the start her solo career. As the set continues, Beyonc√© explains how her record company felt her debut album did not have \\"one\\" hit song. She sarcastically remarks, \\"I guess they were kinda right... I had five.\\" Beyonc√© goes on to perform \\"Crazy in Love\\" (reminiscent of \\"Proud Mary\\" by Tina Turner), \\"Naughty Girl\\" and \\"Get Me Bodied\\". As the show draws to a close, Beyonc√© performs \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\"; she then exits the stage after thanking the audience for their presence. Critical reception Overall, the show received a positive response from many music critics. Mike Weatherford of the Las Vegas Review-Journal wrote, \\"The spectacle rivals Celine Dion's 'A New Day' as the singer transforms from fragile soul to the rock warrior alter ego of her album title, I Am ... Sasha Fierce.\\" Melissa Arseniuk of Las Vegas Weekly wrote in her review of the show, \\"Once Beyonc√© took to the stage, she hardly left it. Appearing both on her own and with back-up dancers, she worked the theater from left to right throughout the showcase. She sang, danced, and looked good while she did it... Indeed, the mezzo-soprano is as easy on the eyes as she is on the ears.\\" John Griffiths of Us Weekly described the concert as \\"lavish\\". Andy Kellman from Allmusic wrote, \\"The show is certainly a theatrical production worthy of Vegas, with Beyonc√© and her large backing band energetically rolling through the singer's back catalog.\\" Darryl Sterdan of the website Jam! commented: \\"Only Beyonce would think an 'intimate' theatre gig should include her massive all-girl band, an orchestra, lasers, dancers, costume changes and a wind machine to keep her hair blowing majestically. And only Beyonce could pull it all together as superbly as she does in this 98-minute... show\\". A writer of The Boston Globe praised I Am... Yours, comparing it with Sin City. He commended the jazz interlude, the acoustic rearrangements of the songs, and the \\"charming B[eyonc√©] telling her life story in [the] song[s]\\". Mike Ragogna of The Huffington Post compared Beyonc√© with Diana Ross during the show and added: \\"This 'concert' is a staged, stripped-down reconfiguration by Beyonc√©... of her current touring extravaganza that covers her biggest hits... as she whisks us through her career highlights in two tidy acts plus an 'intermission' that is nothing of the sort (it's a jazz medley with a dance payoff).\\" He finished his review by saying, \\"Beyonc√©'s I Am...Yours is a satisfying decade-and-then-some retrospective that reveals the artist's interesting back story with a personal warmth\\". Mike Diver of BBC Online reviewed the show positively and said, \\"this is an entirely second-guessable affair, each movement telegraphed and every realigned arrangement (bombast turned down, jazz and funk switched up) meeting the listener's expectations head on.\\" The writer of People magazine described the show as a \\"magic\\". Nate Chinen of The New York Times positively noted that I Am... Yours documents a smaller show than the other ones Beyonc√© usually makes. A less favorable review came from Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly. She writes, \\"I just wish this special had the balls to call itself 'I Am‚Ä¶Mine' and admit that among the many things we admire about Beyonce is that she's not ours. In fact the opposite's true.

Mensa is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere near the south celestial pole, one of twelve constellations drawn up in the 18th century by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for table, though it originally commemorated Table Mountain and was known as Mons Mensae. One of the eighty-eight constellations designated by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), it covers a keystone-shaped wedge of sky 153.5 square degrees in area. Other than the south polar constellation of Octans, it is the most southerly of constellations and is observable only south of the 5th parallel of the Northern Hemisphere. One of the faintest constellations in the night sky, Mensa contains no apparently bright stars‚Äîthe brightest, Alpha Mensae, is barely visible in suburban skies. Part of the Large Magellanic Cloud, several star clusters and a quasar lie in the area covered by the constellation, and at least three of its star systems have been found to have exoplanets. History Initially known as Mons Mensae, Mensa was created by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille out of dim Southern Hemisphere stars in honor of Table Mountain, a South African mountain overlooking Cape Town, near the location of Lacaille's observatory. He recalled that the Magellanic Clouds were sometimes known as Cape clouds, and that Table Mountain was often covered in clouds when a southeasterly stormy wind blew. Hence he made a \\"table\\" in the sky under the clouds. Lacaille had observed and catalogued 10,000 southern stars during a two-year stay at the Cape of Good Hope. He devised 14 new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere not visible from Europe. Mensa was the only constellation that did not honor an instrument symbolic of the Age of Enlightenment. Sir John Herschel proposed shrinking the name to one word in 1844, noting that Lacaille himself had abbreviated some of his constellations thus. Although the stars of Mensa do not feature in any ancient mythology, the mountain it is named after has a rich mythology. Called \\"Tafelberg\\" in Dutch and German, it has two neighboring mountains called \\"Devil's Peak\\" and \\"Lion's Head\\". Table Mountain features in the mythology of the Cape of Good Hope, notorious for its storms. Explorer Bartolomeu Dias saw the mountain as a mythical anvil for storms. Characteristics Mensa is bordered by Dorado to the north, Hydrus to the northwest and west, Octans to the south, Chamaeleon to the east and Volans to the northeast. Covering 153.5 square degrees and 0.372% of the night sky, it ranks 75th of the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is \\"Men\\". The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eug√®ne Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight segments. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between ‚àí69.75¬∞ and ‚àí85.26¬∞. The whole constellation is visible to observers south of latitude 5¬∞N. Features=Stars= Lacaille gave eleven stars in the constellation Bayer designations, using the Greek alphabet to label them Alpha through to Lambda Mensae (excluding Kappa). Gould later added Kappa, Mu, Nu, Xi and Pi Mensae. Stars as dim as these were not generally given designations; however, Gould felt their closeness to the South Celestial Pole warranted their naming. Alpha Mensae is the brightest star with a barely visible apparent magnitude of 5.09, making it the only constellation with no star above magnitude 5.0. Overall, there are 22 stars within the constellation's borders brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5. *Alpha Mensae is a solar-type star (class G7V) 33.32 ¬± 0.02 light-years from Earth. Enter the star name in the identifier box here, take reciprocal of parallax (in mas) and multiply by 3260 to get distance in light-years It came to within 11 light-years from Earth around 250,000 years ago and would have been considerably brighter back then‚Äînearly of second magnitude. An infrared excess has been detected around this star, indicating the presence of a circumstellar disk at a radius of over 147 astronomical units (AU). The estimated temperature of this dust is below 22 K. Search for HIPPARCOS no. of the star: 29271 However, data from Herschel Space Observatory failed to confirm this excess, leaving the finding in doubt. No planetary companions have yet been discovered around it. It has a red dwarf companion star at an angular separation of 3.05 arcseconds; equivalent to a projected separation of roughly 30 AU. (details on the stellar properties of the companion star) *Gamma Mensae is the second-brightest star in the constellation, at magnitude 5.19. Located 104.9 ¬± 0.5 light-years from Earth, it is an ageing (10.6 billion year-old) star around 1.04 times as massive as the Sun. It has swollen to around 5 times the solar radius, becoming an orange giant of spectral type K2III. *Beta Mensae is slightly fainter at magnitude 5.31. Located 660 ¬± 10 light-years from Earth, it is a yellow giant of spectral type G8III, around 3.6 times as massive and 513 times as luminous as the Sun. It is 270 million years old, and lies in front of the Large Magellanic Cloud. *Zeta and Eta Mensae have infrared excesses suggesting they too have circumstellar disks of dust. Zeta Mensae is an ageing white giant of spectral type A5 III around 394 ¬± 4 light-years from Earth, and Eta Mensae is an orange giant of spectral type K4 III, lying 650 ¬± 10 light-years away from Earth. *Pi Mensae is a solar-type (G1) star 59.62 ¬± 0.07 light-years distant. In 2001, a substellar companion was discovered in an eccentric orbit. (web Preprint) Incorporating more accurate Hipparcos data yields a mass range for the companion to be anywhere from 10.27 to 29.9 times that of Jupiter. This confirms its substellar nature with the upper limit of mass putting it in the brown dwarf range. The discovery of a second substellar companion‚Äîa super-Earth‚Äîwas announced on 16 September 2018. It takes 6.27 days to complete its orbit and is the first exoplanet detected by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) submitted for publication. *HD 38283 (Bubup)is a Sun-like star of spectral type F9.5V of magnitude 6.7, located 124.3 ¬± 0.1 light-years distant. In 2011, a gas giant with an Earth-like orbital period of 363 days and a minimum mass a third that of Jupiter was discovered by the radial velocity method. *HD 39194 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K0V and magnitude 8.08, located 86.21 ¬± 0.09 light-years distant. Three planets in close orbit were discovered by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in 2011. The three take 5.6, 14 and 34 days to complete an orbit around their star, and have minimum masses 3.72, 5.94 and 5.14 times that of the Earth respectively. *TZ Mensae is an eclipsing binary that varies between magnitude 6.2 and 6.9 every 8.57 days. It is composed of two white main sequence stars in close orbit. One of these is of spectral type A0V, has a radius twice as that of the Sun and is 2.5 times as massive. The other, an A8V spectral type, has a radius 1.4 times that of the Sun and is 1.5 times as massive. *UX Mensae is another eclipsing binary system composed of two young stars around 1.2 times as massive as the Sun and 2.2 ¬± 0.5 billion years of age, orbiting each other every 4.19 days. The system is 338.2 ¬± 0.9 light-years distant. *TY Mensae is another eclipsing binary system classified as a W Ursae Majoris variable; the two components are so close that they share a common envelope of stellar material. The larger star has been calculated to be 1.86 times as massive, have 1.85 times the diameter and is 13.6 times as luminous, while the smaller is 0.4 times as massive, 0.84 times the diameter, and 1.7 times as luminous as the Sun. Their surface temperatures have been calculated at 8164 and 7183 K respectively. *YY Mensae is an orange giant of spectral type K1III around 2.2 times as massive as the Sun, with 12.7 times its diameter and 70 times its luminosity. A rapidly rotating star with a period of 9.5 days, it is a strong emitter of X-rays and belongs to a class of star known as FK Comae Berenices variables. These stars are thought to have formed with the merger of two stars in a contact binary system. With an apparent magnitude of 8.05, it is 707 ¬± 6 light-years distant. *AH Mensae is a cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf and a red dwarf that orbit each other every 2 hours 57 minutes. The stars are close enough that the white dwarf strips material off the red dwarf, creating an accretion disc that periodically ignites with a resulting brightening of the system. NGC 1987 imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope *TU Mensae is another cataclysmic variable composed of a red dwarf and white dwarf. The orbital period of 2 hours 49 minutes is one of the longest for cataclysmic variable systems exhibiting brighter outbursts, known as superhumps. The normal outbursts result in an increase in brightness lasting around a day every 37 days, while the superhumps last 5‚Äì20 days and take place every 194 days. *AO Mensae is a faint star of magnitude 9.8. An orange dwarf that has 80% the size and mass of the Sun, it is also a BY Draconis variable. These are a class of stars with starspots prominent enough that the star changes brightness as it rotates. It is a member of the Beta Pictoris moving group, a loose association of young stars moving across the galaxy. *WISE 0535‚àí7500 is a binary system composed of two sub-brown dwarfs of spectral class cooler than Y1 located 47 ¬± 3 light-years away. Unable to be separated by observations to date, they are presumed to be of similar mass‚Äî8 to 20 times that of Jupiter‚Äîand are less than one AU apart. =Deep-sky objects= IC 2051 is a spiral galaxy located in Mensa (constellation). The Large Magellanic Cloud lies partially within Mensa's boundaries, although most of it lies in neighbouring Dorado. It is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located at a distance of 163,000 light-years. Among its stars within Mensa are W Mensae, an unusual yellow-white supergiant that belongs to a rare class of star known as a R Coronae Borealis variable, HD 268835, a blue hypergiant that is girded by a vast circumstellar disk of dust, and R71, a luminous blue variable star that brightened in 2012 to over a million times as luminous as the Sun. Also within the galaxy is NGC 1987, a globular cluster estimated to be around 600 million years old that has a significant number of red ageing stars, and NGC 1848, a 27 million year old open cluster. Mensa contains several described open clusters, most of which can be only be clearly observed from large telescopes. PKS 0637-752 is a distant quasar with a calculated redshift of z = 0.651. It was chosen as the first target of the then newly- operational Chandra X-Ray Observatory in 1999. The resulting images revealed a gas jet approximately 330,000 light-years long. It is visible at radio, optical and x-ray wavelengths.

Located at the bottom of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, at the opposite end to Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace served as the principal residence of the Kings and Queens of Scots since the 16th century, and is now a setting for state occasions and official entertaining. Queen Elizabeth spends one week in residence at Holyrood Palace at the beginning of each summer, where she carries out a range of official engagements and ceremonies. The 16th-century Historic Apartments of Mary, Queen of Scots and the State Apartments, used for official and state entertaining, are open to the public throughout the year, except when members of the Royal Family are in residence. Architecture The palace as it stands today was built between 1671‚Äì1678 in a quadrangle layout, approximately from north to south and from east to west, with the exception of the 16th-century north-west tower built by James V. Sir William Bruce designed the 3-storey plus attic classical palace for Charles II, upon the restoration of the monarchy. The principal entrance is located on the west front in a recessed 2-storey range that links the 16th-century north-west tower with a matching south-west tower each with a pair of circular angle-turrets with ball-finialled, conical bell-cast roofs. The entry gateway is framed by massive coupled Roman Doric columns, with the carved Royal Arms of Scotland and an octagonal cupola with clock-face above. The north and south fronts have symmetrical three-storey facades that rise behind to far left and right of 2-storey range with regular arrangement of bays. General repairs were completed by the architect Robert Reid between 1824‚Äì1834 that included the partial rebuilding of the south-west corner tower and refacing of the entire south front in ashlar to match that of the east. The east (rear) elevation has 17 bays with lightly superimposed pilasters of the three classical orders at each floor. The ruins of the abbey church connect to the palace on the north- east corner. For the internal quadrangle, Bruce designed a colonnaded piazza of nine arches on the north, south and east facades with pilasters, again from the three classical orders, to indicate the importance of the three main floors. The plain Doric order is used for the services at ground floor, the Ionic order is used for the state apartments on the first floor, while the elaborate Corinthian order is used for the royal apartments on the second floor. Architectural historian Dan Cruickshank selected the palace as one of his eight choices for the 2002 BBC book The Story of Britain's Best Buildings. Interior The rooms open to the public include the 17th-century former King's apartments and Great Gallery, and the 16th-century apartments in the north-west tower. =17th-century apartments= The Great Stair in the south- west corner of the quadrangle has a 17th-century Baroque ceiling featuring plaster angels holding the Honours of Scotland. The Italian paintings on the walls are fragments of frescoes painted circa 1550 by Lattanzio Gambara, illustrating scenes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. They were bought by Prince Albert in 1856, and placed here in 1881.Clarke, p. 33. At the top of the stair is the Royal Dining Room, formerly part of the Queen's apartments. The Adam style decoration dates from around 1800, when this was part of the Duke of Hamilton's apartment.Clarke, p. 36. The King's apartments occupied the whole of the south and east sides of the quadrangle. Accessed from the Great Stair, the suite of rooms comprising a guard hall, presence chamber, privy chamber, antechamber, bedchamber and closet. The level of privacy, as well as the richness of decoration, increased in sequence. From the visit of George IV in 1822, the guard hall has been used as a throne room, and the order of rooms reversed. The Evening Drawing Room and Morning Drawing Room occupy the former presence chamber and privy chamber, and retain their rich 17th-century ceilings. The Morning Drawing Room is hung with French tapestries bought by Charles II, and is used for private ceremonies.Clarke, pp. 39‚Äì43. The King's Antechamber, Bedchamber and Closet are laid out along the east side of the palace. The King's Bedchamber, at the centre of the east fa√ßade, has the finest of the 17th-century plaster ceilings, augmented by paintings of Hercules by Jacob de Wet II. The 17th-century bed was made for the Duke of Hamilton, although it was long referred to as \\"Queen Mary's Bed\\" when it occupied the older Queen's rooms.Clarke, pp. 43‚Äì45. The Great Gallery, the largest room in the palace, links the King's Closet with the former Queen's apartments in the west range. The gallery is decorated with 110 portraits of the Scottish monarchs, beginning with the legendary Fergus I, who supposedly ruled from 330 BC.Fergus I, King of Scotland (330-305 B.C.) JACOB JACOBSZ DE WET II (HAARLEM 1641/2 - AMSTERDAM 1697), Royal Collection Trust The portraits were all completed between 1684 and 1686 by Jacob de Wet II. This collection celebrated the royal bloodline of Scotland which the Scots upheld for its continuity and antiquity as an important part of their national identity in the seventeenth century.C. Wemyss, \\"The Art of Retrospection and the Country Houses of Post-Restoration Scotland\\" Architectural Heritage XXVI (2015), p. 32. After 1707, Scotland's representative peers were elected here to be sent to Westminster. Bonnie Prince Charlie held evening balls in the gallery during his brief occupation, and it later became a Catholic chapel for the Comte d'Artois. Today it is used for large functions including investitures and banquets.Clarke, pp. 49‚Äì50. =North-west tower= Bird's-eye view of Holyrood Palace and Abbey, including the western towers The suite of rooms on the first floor of the north-west tower comprises an audience chamber, accessed from a lobby next to the Great Gallery, and a bedroom, leading from which are two turret rooms or closets. These rooms were occupied by Lord Darnley in the 16th century, and later formed part of the Queen's apartment in the reconstructed palace, before being taken over by the Duke of Hamilton from 1684.Clarke, pp. 51‚Äì52. Queen Mary occupied an identical suite of rooms on the second floor of the tower: the bedchambers are linked by a private spiral stair. The Queen's outer chamber contains her oratory, and was the scene of the murder of David Rizzio, after he was dragged from the supper table in the northern turret room.Clarke, pp. 56‚Äì58. In later centuries, tourists were often convinced that they could see his blood stains on the floor. The wooden ceilings of both the main rooms date from Queen Mary's time, and the monograms MR (Maria Regina) and IR (Jacobus Rex) refer to her parents, Mary of Guise and James V. Shields commemorating Mary's marriage to Francis II of France are believed to have been carved in 1559 but put in their present position in 1617, when the grisaille frieze was also added.Clarke, p. 55. Gardens and grounds Forecourt fountain Statue of Edward VII outside the Palace The gardens of the palace extend to some , set within the much larger Holyrood Park. In the 16th- century a privy garden was located to the north of the palace, accessed via a wooden gallery from the north-west tower. This was removed in the 19th century when Prince Albert took an interest in the grounds, forming a new carriage drive to the north to avoid the Canongate slums and laying out the garden in its present form.Clarke, p. 64. A small garden building, surviving from the 16th-century, is known as Queen Mary's Bath House, although it is not thought to have been used for bathing.Clarke, pp. 63‚Äì64. The sundial to the north of the palace was carved in 1633 by John Mylne, while the fountain in the forecourt is a 19th-century replica of the 16th-century fountain at Linlithgow Palace.Clarke, p. 30. The ironwork gates and ornamental screens (by George Washington Browne) were erected in the 1920s, along with a statue of Edward VII (by Henry Snell Gamley), unveiled by George V in 1922.Clarke, p. 28. The buildings to the west of the palace, are the 19th-century guardhouse which replaced the tenements of a debtors' sanctuary, and adjacent to this, the former Holyrood Free Church and Duchess of Gordon's School, built in the 1840s. These buildings were converted into the Queen's Gallery in 2002 to display works of art from the Royal Collection. There was formerly a Keeper of Holyrood Park, and the title was held on an hereditary basis by the Earls of Haddington. This was purchased by the Crown and the office extinguished in 1843 after disputes over the Keeper's right to allow quarrying within the Park. In 1987 the Holyrood Palace and Park were added to the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland. =\\"Big Royal Dig\\"= The Palace of Holyroodhouse, along with Buckingham Palace Garden and Windsor Castle, was excavated on 25‚Äì28 August 2006 as part of a special edition of Channel 4's archaeology series Time Team. The archaeologists uncovered part of the cloister of Holyrood Abbey, running in line with the existing abbey ruins, and a square tower associated with the 15th-century building works of James IV was discovered. The team failed to locate evidence of the real tennis court used by Queen Mary to the north of the palace, as the area had been built over in the 19th century. An area of reddened earth was discovered, which was linked with the Earl of Hertford's burning of Holyrood during the Rough Wooing of 1544. Among the objects found were a seal matrix used to stamp the wax seal on correspondence or documents, and a French double tournois coin, minted by Gaston d'Orleans in 1634. History=12th‚Äì15th centuries= The ruins of the Augustinian Holyrood Abbey The ruined Augustinian Holyrood Abbey that is sited in the grounds was founded in 1128 at the order of King David I of Scotland. The name derives either from a legendary vision of the cross witnessed by David I, or from a relic of the True Cross known as the Holy Rood or Black Rood, and which had belonged to Queen Margaret, David's mother.Clarke, p. 8. As a royal foundation, and sited close to Edinburgh Castle, it became an important administrative centre. A Papal legate was received here in 1177, while in 1189 a council of nobles met to discuss a ransom for the captive king, William the Lion.McWilliam et al. p. 125. Robert the Bruce held a parliament at the abbey in 1326, and by 1329 it may already have been in use as a royal residence. In 1370, David II became the first of several Kings of Scots to be buried at Holyrood. Not only was James II born at Holyrood in 1430, it was at Holyrood that he was crowned, married and laid to rest. James III and Margaret of Denmark were married at Holyrood in 1469. The early royal residence was in the abbey guesthouse, which most likely stood on the site of the present north range of the palace, west of the abbey cloister, and by the later 15th century already had dedicated royal apartments. =16th century= Between 1501 and 1505, James IV constructed a new Gothic palace adjacent to the abbey. The impetus for the work probably came from the marriage of James IV to Margaret Tudor, which took place in the abbey in August 1503 while work was still ongoing. The palace was built around a quadrangle, situated west of the abbey cloister. It contained a chapel, gallery, royal apartments, and a great hall. The chapel occupied the north range of the quadrangle, with the Queen's apartments occupying part of the south range. The west range contained the King's lodgings and the entrance to the palace. James IV also oversaw construction of a two-storey gatehouse, fragments of which survive in the Abbey Courthouse. In 1512 a lion house was constructed to house the king's menagerie, which included a lion and a civet among other exotic beasts.Clarke, p. 9. James V added to the palace between 1528 and 1536, beginning with the present north-west tower to provide new royal apartments. This was followed by reconstruction of the south and west ranges of the palace in the Renaissance style, with a new chapel in the south range. The former chapel in the north range was converted into the Council Chamber, where ceremonial events normally took place. The west range contained the royal library and a suite of rooms, extending the royal apartments in the tower.McWilliam et al. p. 126. The symmetrical composition of the west fa√ßade suggested that a second tower at the south-west was planned, though this was never executed at the time.Clarke, p. 10. Around a series of lesser courts were ranged the Governor's Tower, the armoury, the mint, a forge, kitchens and other service quarters.Clarke, p. 10. In 1544, during the War of the Rough Wooing, the Earl of Hertford sacked Edinburgh, and Holyrood was looted and burned. Repairs were made, but the altars were destroyed by a Reforming mob in 1559. After the Scottish Reformation was formalised, the abbey buildings were neglected, and the choir and transepts of the abbey church were pulled down in 1570. The nave was retained as the parish church of the Canongate. William Allan. The royal apartments in the north-west tower of the palace were occupied by Mary, Queen of Scots, from her return to Scotland in 1561 to her forced abdication in 1567. The Queen had archery butts erected in her private gardens to allow her to practice, and hunted deer in Holyrood Park. It was at Holyrood that the series of famous interviews between the Queen and John Knox took place, and she married both of her Scottish husbands in the palace: Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, in 1565 in the chapel, and James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, in 1567 in the great hall.Clarke, p. 12. It was in the Queen's private apartments that she witnessed the murder of David Rizzio, her private secretary, on 9 March 1566. Darnley and several nobles entered the apartment via the private stair from Darnley's own apartments below. Bursting in on the Queen, Rizzio and four other courtiers, who were at supper, they dragged the Italian through the bedchamber into the outer chamber, where he was stabbed 57 times.Clarke, p. 56. During the subsequent Marian civil war, on 25 July 1571, William Kirkcaldy of Grange bombarded the Palace with cannon placed in the Black Friar Yard, near the Pleasance.Thomson, ed., Diurnal of Occurrents (Edinburgh, 1833) p. 232, 234. James VI took up residence at Holyrood in 1579 at the age of 13 years. The building was refurbished by William MacDowall with a new north gallery painted by Walter Binning, and an apartment for the king's favourite, Esm√© Stewart.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1574-1580, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1978), pp. 162, 166: Henry Paton, ed, Accounts of the Master of Works, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1957), pp. 302‚Äì307: Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1574‚Äì1581, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 357. In 1590 his wife, Anne of Denmark, was crowned in the diminished abbey church in 1590, at which time the royal household at the palace numbered around 600 persons. The architect William Schaw was entrusted to repair the palace, and in 1590 received 625 gold crowns from Queen Elizabeth for the building work.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 55. The palace was not however secure enough to prevent the king and queen being surprised in their lodgings in December 1592 and July 1593 by Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, a nobleman implicated by the North Berwick Witch Trials.Edward Cowan, 'Darker vision of the Scottish renaissance', in Renaissance & Reformation in Scotland (Edinburgh, 1983), pp. 132-134. =17th century= When James became King of England in 1603 and moved to London, the palace was no longer the seat of a permanent royal court. James visited in 1617, for which the chapel was redecorated. More repairs were put in hand in preparation for the coronation of Charles I as King of Scotland at Holyrood in 1633. On 10 August 1646 Charles appointed James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton, as hereditary Keeper of Holyroodhouse, an office which his descendants retain.Clarke, p. 17. The post is one of the Great Offices in the Royal Household in Scotland, and indeed the private ducal apartments cover a larger area of the palace than the state ones. As well as his own deputy, the Keeper still appoints the Bailie of Holyroodhouse, who is responsible for law and order within the Holyrood Abbey Sanctuary. The High Constables of Holyroodhouse are responsible to the Keeper. The west range of the palace drawn around 1649 by James Gordon of Rothiemay, prior to reconstruction in the 1670s. The following year saw the Restoration of Charles II in England and Scotland. The Privy Council was reconstituted and once more met at Holyrood. Repairs were put in hand to allow use of the building by the Earl of Lauderdale, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and a full survey was carried out in 1663 by John Mylne.Clarke, p. 14. In 1670, ¬£30,000 was set aside by the Privy Council for the rebuilding of Holyrood.McWilliam et al. p. 127. Plans for complete reconstruction were drawn up by Sir William Bruce, the Surveyor of the King's Works, and Robert Mylne, the King's Master Mason. The design included a south-west tower to mirror the existing tower, a plan which had existed since at least Charles I's time. Following criticism from Charles II, Bruce redesigned the interior layout to provide suites of royal apartments on the first floor: the Queen's apartment on the west side; and the King's apartment on the south and east sides. The two were linked by a gallery to the north, and a council chamber occupied the south-west tower. Work began in July 1671, starting at the north-west, which was ready for use by Lauderdale the following year. In 1675 Lord Hatton became the first of many nobles to take up a grace-and-favour apartment in the palace. The following year the decision was taken to rebuild the west range of the palace, and to construct a kitchen block to the south-east of the quadrangle. Bruce's appointment as architect of the project was cancelled in 1678, with the remaining work being overseen by Hatton. By 1679 the palace had been re-constructed, largely in its present form. Craftsmen employed included the Dutch carpenters Alexander Eizat and Jan van Santvoort, and their countryman Jacob de Wet who painted several ceilings. The elaborate plasterwork was done by John Houlbert and George Dunsterfield.Clarke, p. 16. Interior work was still in progress when the James, Duke of Albany, the future James VII and II, and his wife Mary of Modena visited that year.McWilliam et al. p. 128. They returned to live at Holyrood between 1680 and 1682, in the aftermath of the Exclusion crisis, which had severely impacted James' popularity in England. When he acceded to the throne in 1685, the Catholic king set up a Jesuit college in the Chancellor's Lodging to the south of the palace. The abbey was adapted as a chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1687‚Äì88. The architect was James Smith, and carvings were done by Grinling Gibbons and William Morgan. The interiors of this chapel, and the Jesuit college, were subsequently destroyed by an anti-Catholic mob, following the beginning of the Glorious Revolution in late 1688. In 1691 the Kirk of the Canongate was completed, to replace the abbey as the local parish church, and it is at the Kirk of the Canongate that the Queen today attends services when in residence at Holyrood Palace. =18th century= A view of the palace and abbey in 1789 After the Union of Scotland and England in 1707 the palace lost its principal functions, although it was used for the elections of Scottish representative peers.Clarke, p. 49. The nobles who had been granted apartments in the palace continued to use them: the Duke of Hamilton had already taken over the Queen's Apartments in 1684. The King's Apartments were meanwhile neglected. Bonnie Prince Charlie held court at Holyrood for five weeks in September and October 1745, during the Jacobite Rising. Charles occupied the Duke of Hamilton's apartments rather than the unkempt king's rooms, and held court in the Gallery. The following year, government troops were billeted in the palace after the Battle of Falkirk, when they damaged the royal portraits in the gallery, and the Duke of Cumberland stayed here on his way to Culloden.Clarke, pp. 17‚Äì19. Meanwhile, the neglect continued: the roof of the abbey church collapsed in 1768, leaving it as it currently stands. However, the potential of the palace as a tourist attraction was already being recognised, with the Duke of Hamilton allowing paying guests to view Queen Mary's apartments in the north-west tower.Clarke, pp. 19‚Äì20. The precincts of Holyrood Abbey, extending to the whole of Holyrood Park, had been designated as a debtors' sanctuary since the 16th century. Those in debt could escape their creditors, and imprisonment, by taking up residence within the sanctuary, and a small community grew up to the west of the palace. The residents, known colloquially as \\"Abbey Lairds\\", were able to leave the sanctuary on Sundays, when no arrests were permitted. The area was controlled by a baillie, and by several constables, appointed by the Keeper of Holyroodhouse. The constables now form a ceremonial guard at the palace.Clarke, p. 20. =19th century= Following the French Revolution, George III allowed Louis XVI's youngest brother, the Comte d'Artois to live at Holyrood, where he took advantage of the abbey sanctuary to avoid his creditors. Artois stayed at Holyrood from 1796 to 1803, during which time the King's apartments were renovated. The Comte d'Artois inherited the French throne in 1824 as Charles X, but following the July Revolution of 1830, the French royal family lived at Holyrood again until 1832 when they moved to Austria. King George IV became the first reigning monarch since Charles I to visit Holyrood, during his 1822 visit to Scotland. Although he stayed at Dalkeith Palace, the king held a lev√©e (reception) at Holyrood, and was shown the historic apartments. He ordered repairs to the palace, but declared that Queen Mary's rooms should be protected from any future changes.Clarke, p. 22. Over the next ten years, Robert Reid oversaw works including the demolition of all the buildings to the north and south of the main quadrangle. In 1834 William IV agreed that the High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland could make use of the palace during the sitting of the assembly, and this tradition continues today. On the first visit of Queen Victoria to Scotland in 1842, she also stayed at Dalkeith, and was prevented from visiting Holyrood by an outbreak of scarlet fever.Clarke, p. 23. In preparation for her 1850 visit, more renovations were carried out by Robert Matheson of the Office of Works, and the interiors were redecorated by David Ramsay Hay.Clarke, p. 24. Over the next few years, the lodgings of the various nobles were gradually repossessed, and Victoria was able to take up a second floor apartment in 1871, freeing up the former royal apartments as dining and drawing rooms, as well as a throne room. From 1854 the historic apartments in the north-west tower were formally opened to the public.Clarke, p. 26. =20th century= Although Edward VII visited briefly in 1903, it was George V who transformed Holyrood into a 20th-century palace. Central heating and electric light were installed prior to his first visit in 1911, and after the First World War improvements to bathrooms and kitchens were carried out. In the 1920s the palace was formally designated as the monarch's official residence in Scotland, and became the location for regular royal ceremonies and events.Clarke, pp. 27‚Äì28. =21st century= Royal Standard is flown when the monarch is in residence. The present Queen spends one week at Holyrood in summer, during which time investitures are held in the gallery, audiences are held in the morning room, and garden parties are hosted.Clarke, p. 4. While she is in residence, the Scottish variant of the Royal Standard of the United Kingdom is flown; at all other times the Royal Banner of Scotland is displayed. During the Queen's visits, the Royal Company of Archers form her ceremonial bodyguard. The Ceremony of the Keys, in which she is formally presented with the keys of Edinburgh by the Lord Provost, is held on her arrival. At the Palace the Queen meets and appoints the First Minister of Scotland. Prince Charles also stays at Holyrood for one week a year, carrying out official duties as the Duke of Rothesay, while other members of the royal family, including the Princess Royal, visit in a less official capacity. In its role as the official residence of the monarch in Scotland, Holyroodhouse has hosted a number of foreign visitors and dignitaries, including Harald V of Norway in 1994, Nelson Mandela in 1997, Vladimir Putin in 2003,Clarke, p. 5. and Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. A meeting of the European Council was held at the palace during the British presidency of the council in 1992. Holyroodhouse remains the property of the Crown. As the official royal residence in Scotland, building conservation and maintenance work on the Palace and Abbey falls to Scottish Ministers and is delivered on their behalf by the Conservation Directorate of Historic Environment Scotland ‚Äì a public body of the Scottish Government. Public access is managed by the Royal Collection Trust, with revenues used to support the work of the trust as custodians of the Royal Collection. In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a ¬£10m project that will redevelop the outside space at Holyroodhouse, including Holyrood Abbey, the grounds and forecourt. The project will be completed at the end of 2018 in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland, and will include the restoration of the Abbey Strand buildings which will house a learning centre. Ghost The naked ghost of one Bald Agnes (Agnes Sampson), stripped and tortured in 1592 after being accused of witchcraft, is said to roam the palace.

The primary organ of excretion is a nephridium. Drawing of excretory system of Lymnaea meridensis; renal tube and ureter in renal region extending between pericardium and mantle collar Structure The most primitive gastropods retain two nephridia, but in the great majority of species, the right nephridium has been lost, leaving a single excretory organ, located in the anterior part of the visceral mass. The nephridium projects into the main venous sinus in the animal's foot. The circulatory fluid of gastropods, known as haemolymph directly bathes the tissues, where it supplies them with oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste, a necessary waste product of metabolism. From the arterial sinuses bathing the tissues, it drains into the venous sinus, and thus flows past the nephridium. The main body cavity of most aquatic gastropods also includes pericardial glands, often located above the heart. These secrete waste into the haemolymph, prior to further filtration in the nephridium. Pulmonates lack these glands, so that the nephridium is the only major organ of excretion. In some gastropods, the nephridium opens directly into the sinus, but more usually, there is a small duct, referred to as the renopericardial canal. In aquatic gastropods, the nephridium is drained by a ureter that opens near the rear of the mantle cavity. This allows the flow of water through the cavity to flush out the excreta. Terrestrial pulmonates instead have a much longer ureter, that opens near the anus. In addition to the pericardial glands and nephridum, excretory cells are also present in the digestive glands opening into the stomach. These glands have a metabolic function, somewhat similar to that of the vertebrate liver, and excrete waste products directly into the digestive system, where it is voided with the faeces. Water balance In aquatic gastropods, the waste product is invariably ammonia, which rapidly dissolves in the surrounding water. In the case of freshwater species, the nephridium also resorbs a significant amount of salt in order to prevent its loss through osmosis into the surrounding water. Terrestrial species instead excrete insoluble uric acid, which allows them to maintain their internal water balance. Even so, most species require a somewhat humid environment, and secrete a considerable amount of water in their slime trail. Those few species that dwell in arid environments typically hibernate or aestivate during dry periods to preserve moisture.

The species is a member of the carp family (family Cyprinidae) of the order Cypriniformes, native to China. The White Cloud Mountain minnow is practically extinct in its native habitat, due to pollution and tourism. It was believed to be extinct for over 20 years in 1980, but an apparently native population of this fish was discovered on Hainan Island, well away from the White Cloud Mountain. They are bred in farms and are easily available through the aquarium trade. However, inbreeding in farms has led to genetically weak stock that is vulnerable to disease and prone to physical deformities. The species was discovered at White Cloud Mountain (ÁôΩÈõ≤Â±±; Pinyin B√°i Y√∫n ShƒÅn) in the city of Gu«éngzh≈çu at the province of Gu«éngd≈çng around the 1930s by a Boy Scout leader called Tan, hence the generic name Tanichthys (\\"Tan's fish\\"). The specific name albonubes is from the Latin alba nubes (white cloud). The fish are sold in the aquarium trade under a variety of names, including White Cloud, White Cloud Mountain fish, White Cloud minnow, etc. The names Canton or China danio (although it is not technically a danio) and cardinal fish are also encountered. In Chinese the fish is known as ÂîêÈ≠ö (t√°ng yu), Âª£Êù±Á¥∞ÈØΩ (Gu«éngd≈çng x√¨j√¨), or ÊΩòÊ∞èÁ¥∞ÈØΩ (pƒÅnsh√¨ x√¨j√¨). Aphyocypris pooni is an obsolete synonym for this species; it was coined to designate a color variety which is now known to be the same species as the White Cloud Mountain minnow. Description T. albonubes This species grows to approximately 4 cm (roughly 1.5 in) in overall length, and is silver-green in color with a bright red caudal and dorsal fin. Several varieties have been developed through the fish's domestication, one with bright light edges to the dorsal and anal fins and one with red edges to those fins. The species can also be found in a golden cultivar and a rosy pink variety that displays red on all of the fins, and all color morphs can have long finnage. Sexual dimorphism is slight but noticeable. The male generally has brighter colors and a slimmer body, and the male's dorsal and anal fins are wide and fan-shaped, whereas those of the female are triangular and wedge- shaped. Females also present a whiter, distended abdomen. Diet and feeding The White Cloud Mountain minnow is an opportunistic omnivore. It will commonly feed on a variety of sea grasses and insect larvae. They particularly relish mosquito and shrimp. In times of extreme ecological pressure, such as drought or sunlight infiltration, the minnow often overlooks the simple vegetation for more nutritious food sources including fruits, nuts, and in extreme cases mountain minnows have been observed scavenging off carcasses of fellow pond dwelling organisms. In captivity=In the aquarium= White Cloud Mountain minnows are considered good fish for beginners, as they are extremely forgiving with regard to aquarium temperature and water quality. Standard flake or pellet food is accepted readily. They are often sold as ideal \\"starter fish\\" for cycling a new aquarium, however, this process can be stressful or even fatal, and it is advisable to introduce the fish to an already cycled tank. They are shoaling fish, and feel most comfortable in a group of at least five. An individual of these minnows kept alone may become timid and lose its bright color. White Clouds are generally peaceful and happy to coexist with other fish, as long as they are not put in a tank with larger fish that may eat them. The minnows are usually top or middle-level swimmers and rarely swim close to the bottom of a tank. A typical lifespan can last for five years or longer. Although the nominal temperature range for the species in the wild is 18-22 ¬∞C (64-72 ¬∞F), it can survive water temperatures down to 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F). This makes it an ideal fish for keeping in an unheated aquarium in cold climates. In fact, White Clouds are more active and healthier when kept at temperatures lower than those at which most tropical tanks are kept. Water hardness (dH) should be from 5 to 19, and pH levels should range between 6.0 and 8.0. Also, the aquarium should have a top. White Clouds have been known to jump out on rare occasions. \\"Meteor Minnow\\" variety During the 1940s and 1950s, White Cloud Mountain minnows acquired the nickname, the \\"Poor Man's Neon Tetra,\\" because they were much more affordable in price than the colorful and then expensive neon tetras.Rundle, J. (March, 2004). How to Breed White Clouds. Practical Fishkeeping Two variants are commonly available: the \\"Golden Cloud\\" and the longer-finned \\"Meteor Minnow\\", which can be gold as well. The Golden Cloud is a relatively new variety as compared to the Meteor Minnow. The Meteor Minnow first made its appearance in the 1950s in Perth, Western Australia, and the Golden Cloud in the 1990s. Inbreeding of Golden Clouds have resulted in \\"Blonde\\" Clouds, light yellow specimens similar in colour to blonde guppies and \\"Pink Clouds\\", flesh colour specimens which lacks further pigmentation still, except for the red on the fins. =In the pond= Although it is a small fish, the White Cloud Mountain minnow is sometimes used as a pond fish, especially in ponds intended for frogs to breed. Adult White Cloud Mountain minnows will sometimes eat frog eggs as the tadpoles begin to move about or wait for them to hatch. Once tadpoles are a couple of days old they are out of danger. White Cloud Mountain minnows will effectively control the breeding of mosquitoes. They will breed readily in ponds as long as there are no other fish. While they can endure temperatures as low as 5 ¬∞C (41 ¬∞F), they should have good heating systems in the pond to prevent the water from freezing over in climates where this occurs regularly, making them more ideal for Subtropical climates (similar to their native habitat). =Breeding= Male White Cloud Mountain minnows sparring in an aquarium White Clouds are easy to breed and are recommended for novice breeders. They may be conditioned for breeding with live foods such as brine shrimp and daphnia. The most colorful minnows should be placed in a small tank with a spawning mop or some java moss. Males will attempt to attract females by displaying their fins, often alongside one another. White Clouds are egg-scatterers, dropping their eggs freely amongst the vegetation. Because they do not generally cannibalize their offspring, the parents can be left in the tank. White cloud eggs hatch within 48 to 60 hours. The tiny fry may be visible on the sides of the glass or among plants. After they are free swimming, they can be fed a finely powdered fish food or infusoria. Spawning activity could include: flaring of the fins on males, a gravid spot on females, or males reluctantly chasing females.

Life He was born in August 1683, his father being a prosperous brewer at Chiswick, Middlesex. He was educated at St Paul's School, and was admitted in 1701 to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He graduated B.A. 1704, M.A. 1708, B.D. 1716, D.D. 1725. He was a fellow of his college in 1707, and a moderator in the university in 1708. On 6 October 1724 he was chosen Master of his college, and held the office till 20 February 1744. Soon after his appointment he was presented by Bishop Thomas Green to the rectory of Conington in Cambridgeshire, and afterwards to that of Hadstock in Essex; the latter he held for many years. In 1730 and 1731 he was a reforming vice-chancellor of the university, in particular prohibiting the practice of exhuming bodies from the neighbouring churchyard, for dissection by medical students. After refusing the bishopric of Gloucester in 1734, Mawson was consecrated bishop of Llandaff, 18 February 1739. This diocese he administered for two years, and in 1740 was translated to Chichester. On the death of Sir Thomas Gooch in 1754, he was translated again, to Ely, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died unmarried at his house in Kensington Square, 23 November 1770, aged eighty-seven years and three months, having been active and healthy until before his death. He was buried in his cathedral of Ely, and a monument was erected to his memory by his chaplain and executor, Dr. Warren. Legacy Mawson's official income and his inheritance of the fortune made by his brother in the family business gave him great wealth. To King's College, Cambridge, he made a large loan for their new buildings. At Ely he gave ¬£1,000 to the cathedral. He also endowed Corpus Christi in 1754 with property sufficient to found twelve scholarships. Works Mawson's published works consist of single sermons, preached at anniversary gatherings, and the like, and a speech made before the gentlemen of Sussex, at Lewes, 11 October 1745, on the occasion of the 1745 Rebellion.

He attended the University of Central Lancashire, graduating in 1993 with a degree in Politics and Social Policy. In 2001, he became Managing Director at the world's largest consultancy firm, TMP Worldwide Advertising and Communications and Monster.com and, chairman of Waterhouse Consulting Group in 2009. Azmi founded the British Federation of Racial Equality Councils, a UK body of racial equality councils and partnerships representing over 100 councils across England, Scotland and Wales. He also founded the think tank Race Equality West Midlands and the Herefordshire Equality Partnership.  Civil service career  In October 2004, he was appointed as UK Government's Chief Diversity Adviser at the Cabinet Office. He launched the 10-Point Plan on diversity to drive change across Whitehall and for the first time in the UK, linked diversity performance of each government department to the pay and bonus of Permanent Secretaries. The Times wrote: \\"Azmi raised eyebrows when he announced that the bonuses of permanent secretaries would be linked to their success in meeting the targets\\". Britain's only Asian Permanent Secretary, Sir Suma Chakrabarti, and a former Minister, Keith Vaz, welcomed the announcement, saying it would accelerate change in the civil service. But Keith Vaz warned: \\"I'm quite sure there will be resistance to this\\". Azmi's work led each government department to prepare a delivery plan and stepped up the pace of change including advertising for open competition the posts of Permanent Secretaries, Ambassadors and other sensitive and top governmental jobs. The Guardian called Azmi \\"The Equaliser\\" and The Times called him \\"Whitehall's diversity champ.\\" Pat McFadden, the then Cabinet Office Minister said in a speech that Azmi was \\"doing a hugely important job\\".Cabinet Office (2007) 'Informing the Public Speech by Pat McFadden, Cabinet Office Minister Joint Event with Howell James, Permanent Secretary Government Communications', page 6, London: Cabinet Office, http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130128101412/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/corp/assets/publications/speeches/mcfadden/rtf/informing_public.rtf Other commentators like Paul Zickel writing in The Times said: \\"Disability in the Civil Service recently moved out of the shadows and into the mainstream. For me, the key driver was the Civil Service-wide ten-point plan developed by Waqar Azmi\\".  Public inquiries  Azmi has been involved in several Public Inquiries in the UK. He was also on the 2001 Oldham riots Inquiry which was set up to investigate the riots that occurred in May 2001. He was an open critic of the Inquiry, claiming that under government pressure the Inquiry was steered towards language and citizenship, instead of structural inequalities and the growing influence of far-right groups such as the British National Party (BNP).  Awards, nominations and honorary degrees  Waqar Azmi received an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2002 at the age of 32 by Her Majesty the Queen in recognition of his major contributions in the UK and in 2003 he was awarded Britain's Young Asian Achievers Award by Lloyds TSB. In 2001 Azmi was awarded an Honorary master's degree by the University of Worcester. In 2006 he was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Southampton Solent University, and later that year, the University of Central Lancashire awarded him an Honorary Fellowship. In January 2015, Azmi was nominated for the Spirit of Britain award at the British Muslim Awards.  Views on extremism  The Times of India wrote: \\"After he had finished delivering an inspiring speech at a career fest last week, Dr Waqar Azmi was almost mobbed by the crowd. It seemed like the Muslim gathering had waited for a long time for someone like him\\". Speaking to a Muslim audience of 150,000 (Urdu/Hindi: 1.5 lakh people) in Mumbai, he \\"slammed those who killed innocent people in the name of Islam. Evil has taken over the hearts of those who maim innocent children, blow up houses and kill people. It is our duty to help purify those dirty hearts,\\" he said. A section of Muslims had gone astray as they had left the Prophet's message behind, he said. \\"We must illuminate the hearts of those misguided.\\" Azmi sees globalisation as an opportunity for greater integration and understanding. He cites the Prophet's choices in the initial days of Islam: \\"He could have tried to destroy all non-Muslims in Medina; commanded everyone to become a Muslim; or chosen the path of integration. He chose the last option and invited everyone, including Jews and Christians, to the society he formed. The problem surfaces when, instead of integration, Muslims want to colonise. They want to create a separate society.\\" Azmi also believes that Muslims themselves are largely responsible for the problems and challenges that exists in their communities due to a lack of education, activism and effective leadership: \\"Muslims have become reactionary rather than responding forces,\\" he says. \\"Reaction leads to friction and destruction while responding paves the way for reconciliation and peace. When controversies erupt over cartoons or films on the Prophet, I tell Muslims there is no image of the Prophet. So any cartoon or film depicting him will be fake. Why fight over a fake depiction? When Muslims react violently, they play into the hands of forces that want to incite the community and paint it as reactionary\\".

It is mainly used in project environments of the Petroleum industry and is defined as the value of goods and services progressed, regardless of whether or not they have been paid for or received. The primary purpose of determining VOWD is to get an accurate and comprehensive as possible estimate of cost for a project at a point in time. This is used in overall project management including reporting and cost control.  Introduction  Unlike the earned value, which measures the value of goods and services received as a percentage of the planned value, the VOWD is not measured against the plan, but against the committed cost. Committed costs can be derived from purchase orders, contracts, approved changes, change orders and other forms of commitments. From an earned value management point of view, the VOWD is comparable to the actual cost achieved rather than the earned value. VOWD represents the full value of the work that has been achieved, at a point in time, against the commercial criteria of the commitments for that work, regardless of payment or receipt. The main methods of calculating VOWD are as follows: = VOWD for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services = VOWD of EPC (contract) services are measured in terms of actual physical progress based on the documentary evidence of the deliverable produced. The VOWD is determined by applying the percentage of physical progress achieved to the current committed value of the cost of that item, which is in general the contract or purchase order value, including any approved changes''. For services specifically, incurred hours to a point in time can be used as a basis for progress, including hours recorded and those yet to be recorded for a specific point in time, as long as they were incurred to that point in time. = VOWD for tagged equipment = The VOWD for procuring tagged equipment is usually calculated based on a milestone deliverables basis as this type of equipment and its contractual milestones and VOWD are usually closely aligned. Tagged equipment is any equipment that is one (or a few) of a kind specific to a project and type of equipment required for that project. It is not a commodity and specific for a particular task. Examples of tagged equipment include; a pump, a motor, a drive, some electrical wire, a control cabinet, some specific instrumentation, a gauge, transformers. It is not bulk in nature. Milestones examples may include; 10% on order execution, 20% on ________, 40% on __________, 10% on _________, 10% on ________________. = VOWD for procured regular bulk materials = The VOWD for procured bulk materials is usually calculated based on the quantities of materials delivered. The percent complete is calculated by dividing the quantity of material received at the site by the total quantity required for the project. The resulting percent is multiplied by the current agreed committed value of the material item to obtain the VOWD for that item. Examples of regular bulk materials include; ‚Äìstandard valves; such as small valves, with standard and published specifications, easily obtainable from alternative sources, comparable in nature, larger valves with the same characteristics also are regular bulk materials, more than one, a number in quantity, required for a number of applications and locations within/for a project ‚Äìstandard pipe and tubing; same as above ‚Äìsteel; same as above If there are significant quantities with financial and commercial obligations for such items en route, prior to receipt of such goods, these quantities should be included in the VOWD percent complete calculation for regular bulk materials. = VOWD for procured non regular bulk materials = The VOWD for procured non regular bulk materials is usually calculated based on estimate of percent complete basis. The percent complete is calculated by dividing the quantity of material progressed at a point in time by the total quantity required for the project. The resulting percent is multiplied by the current agreed committed value of the material item to obtain the VOWD for that item. Adjustments, +/-, to the quantities should be made for other factors that affect the completion of the non regular bulk material. Characteristics of non regular bulk materials are; higher or high quantity of materials, non routine, unusual, special order, non regular, special run, non standard in nature. Examples of non regular bulk materials include; -Non regular valves - those that require unique or specialized specification, testing or manufacturing or similar, something that makes them non routine, high or higher volume in total quantity -Non regular pipes, tubes - those that require a special mill run, a large separate order of steel, special testing to meet specification or special manufacturing to meet project requirements, more than one in quantity, usually many -Steel - materials that require unique configuration, design, manufacturing and similar, much material, not simply one piece Adjustments might include steel mill retooling upfront costs, specialized steps to manufacture, temper, role, test or certify the pipe going through the mill. There is value in these steps that needs to be incorporated into the VOWD determination. To get documentary evidence to support an estimate as to the value of these steps one might use the milestones as inputs, supplier reports, pictures, video, progress reports on KPI's, supplier surveillance, as well as interim costs of shipping, handling and transportation. = VOWD for procured major equipment = A. Weighted value basis One method for determining VOWD for major equipment is based on weighted values of items of equipment. At the outset of the project a list of equipment is prepared, and the weighted (%) value of each piece of equipment, with the sum of the weighted values of all items totaling 100%. When an item of equipment is received on site the percentage contribution of that equipment is added to the previous months weighted value of all other equipment to determine the total cumulative percentage value of equipment received on site. The VOWD of major equipment is calculated by multiplying the weighted percentage value of all equipment received at site by the total current approved contract value of the Major Equipment scope. B. Percent Complete Basis When weighted values are not available or appropriate for determining VOWD, an alternative method would be percent complete basis. The VOWD of major equipment is calculated by multiplying the weighted percentage value of all progress of the major equipment, at a point in time, by the total current approved contract value of the Major Equipment scope. To get documentary evidence to support an estimate as to the value of these steps one might use the milestones as inputs, as well as supplier reports, pictures, video, progress reports on KPI's, supplier surveillance, as well as interim costs of shipping, handling and transportation. Key inputs into the equipment can also help determining progress, such as key quantities and steps and stages of construction. Examples of major equipment include; an off shore platform, a vessel, a barge, a steam turbine generator, a large mine hopper, or similar. = VOWD for construction = For construction the physical percent complete of any element of the work is measured based on a physical measurement system (but not in terms of job-hours expended, as the measurement system needs to be fixed during the project duration). Apply the same principles as in major equipment to determine the VOWD for construction. Examples of construction include; a building, a manufacturing plant, a complex, multifaceted industrial equipment or facility. = What VOWD is not = VOWD is not solely based on goods and services receipts. VOWD is not solely based on cash and or invoice payments. VOWD is not simply a milestone based costing valuation. These components are referenced in determining VOWD, however VOWD is a more fulsome valuation determination of the full value of goods and services committed to and obligated to, at a point in time. Regardless of whether they have been paid for or have been completely received.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and contains the only medieval stone-built open hall to survive in Chester. History The date of its original building is not known but it was altered in the 17th, 18th and 20th centuries. At the time of the Civil War the house was the home of Sir Francis Gamul, a Royalist supporter and colonel of the Town Guard. Charles I stayed in the house on 23‚Äì24 September 1645, when his army was defeated at the Battle of Rowton Moor. Following the Great Fire of London the town Assembly ruled in 1671 that all the houses in the main streets should have roofs of slate or tile. The medieval frontage of Gamul House was replaced by a brick fa√ßade, but the hall was retained. In the 18th century the stone arches in the undercroft were replaced by brick vaults. During the following century this area was occupied by shops. For a time it housed a boarding school but this closed in the 1860s. In the 20th century the house became unoccupied and neglected; when Nikolaus Pevsner visited Chester in the late 1960s he reported that it looked derelict. It was bought by Chester City Council and during the 1970s a major refurbishment took place. As of 2009 the building is occupied by a restaurant and shops. Architecture=Exterior= The building is constructed in sandstone and timber framing, with a brick frontage and has three storeys. The lowest storey (an undercroft) is occupied by shops. An external staircase parallel to the street has 15 steps leading up to the former row level. Behind the staircase at street level is another shop frontage consisting of a door with a four-light window on each side. The middle storey has a door with an architrave and pediment. There are three windows to the south of the door and two windows to the north, all with 40 panes of glass. Above these is a string course. In the top storey are three oval windows with four panes and two sash windows with six panes. The roof is in grey slate with its ridge parallel to the street; it is hipped at its north end and at the south end is a gable and a chimney stack. =Interior= The undercroft contains a large oak beam and brick barrel vaults. At the row level, the great hall occupies the two storeys. On the west wall of the hall is an ornate sandstone fireplace with decorated pilasters carrying a carved frieze and cornice. On the fireplace is a painting of the arms of the Gamul family, which Pevsner considers was executed by Randle Holme. The barrel-vaulted plaster ceiling has eight richly- carved pendants. Today As of 2009 the Row level is occupied by the Brewery Tap Ale House.

V. Wedgwood. Specializing in the history of 17th-century England and Continental Europe, her biographies and narrative histories are said to have provided a clear, entertaining middle ground between popular and scholarly works. Early life Wedgwood was born in Stocksfield, Northumberland, on 20 July 1910. She was the only daughter of Sir Ralph Wedgwood, a railway executive, and his wife Iris Veronica Pawson, a novelist and travel writer. She and her brother, Sir John Wedgwood, were great-great-great-grandchildren of the pottery entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood. She was educated at home, and then at Norland Place School. She earned a First in Classics and Modern History at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where A. L. Rowse said she was \\"my first outstanding pupil\\". Career Wedgwood published her first biography, Strafford, at the age of 25 and The Thirty Years War, \\"her big book ... covering a large canvas\\", according to Rowse, just three years later, a work Patrick Leigh Fermor called \\"[b]y far the best and most exciting book on the whole period\\". She specialised in European history of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Her work in continental European history included the major study The Thirty Years War (1938) and biographies of William the Silent and Cardinal Richelieu. She devoted the greater part of her research to English history, especially in the English Civil War. Her major works included a biography of Oliver Cromwell and two volumes of a planned trilogy, The Great Rebellion, which included The King's Peace (1955) and The King's War (1958). She continued the story with The Trial of Charles I (1964). She was known to walk battlefields and experience the same weather and field conditions as the subjects of her histories, mindful that Cromwell had no military experience and most participants in the English Civil War were \\"talented amateurs\\" when it came to military manoeuvres. The subject was one of great controversy and rival schools of historical interpretations, but she held herself apart, \\"probably put off by the sheer scholasticism into which the treatment of the subject had degenerated, the rudeness with which academics treated each other over it, when she herself was always courteous and lady-like.\\" Instead, \\"what was remarkable about Wedgwood's view of the Civil War was the way in which she depicted the sheer confusion of it all, the impossibility of co-ordinating events in three countries, once order from the centre had broken down\\". Of William the Silent (1944), Rowse wrote that she \\"displayed not only a mastery of research but maturity of judgement, with a literary capacity not common in academic writing. She wrote indeed to be read, and not surprisingly the book began for her a long procession of prizes and honours...\\" The New York Times singled it out as a landmark: \\"Miracles do happen. A generation ago the young English woman historian was often tethered to a dry theme until she had nibbled it bald. Today she dares much more to select a major subject\\", and praised her scholarship for balancing complex details with human drama: \\"Miss Wedgwood has not faltered before the intricacy or magnitude of this checkered struggle, and hers is a glowing, substantial, ingeniously organized book.\\" Thirty years after she published a biography of Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, she published a much-revised version that was considerably more critical of her subject. In the earlier version she called him a \\"sincere, brave and able man\\". After using a collection of his family's papers that had not been available before, she deemed him greedy and unscrupulous. She was well regarded in academic circles and her books were widely read. She was also successful as a lecturer and broadcaster. In 1953 the BBC invited her to present her impressions of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. She was a tutor at Somerville College, Oxford,{{cite weburl=https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/pubs/proc/files/97p521.pdftitle=Cicely Veronica Wedgwood 1910-1997website=The British Academy} and she was a Special Lecturer at University College London from 1962 to 1991. According to the Economist, she \\"had a novelist's talent for entering into the character of the giants of history.\\" She published using her initials C.V. as a nom de plume to disguise her gender, aware of prejudice against women as serious historians. She wrote as well about the historian's responsibility to do more than analyse or describe. Rather than pose as a disinterested observer, she wrote: \\"Historians should always draw morals.\\" She offered her own alternative to the neatness provided by theory: \\"[T]he whole value of the study of history is for me its delightful undermining of certainty, its cumulative insistence of the differences of point of view ... it is not lack of prejudice which makes for dull history, but lack of passion.\\" George Steiner, complaining that \\"[m]uch of what passes for history at present is scarcely literate\\", set Wedgwood apart: She acknowledged that contemporary concerns affected her historical assessments. In the 1957 introduction to a new release of The Thirty Years War, which first appeared in 1938, she wrote: \\"I wrote this book in the thirties, against the background of depression at home and mounting tension abroad. The preoccupations of that unhappy time cast their shadows over its pages.\\" She replied to critics of her attention to biography and the role of the individual in history: Her biographies and narrative histories are said to have \\"provided a clear, entertaining middle ground between popular and scholarly works.\\" By 1966 her reputation and notoriety were sufficient to allow the authors of a study of The Nature of Narrative to invoke her name in reference to the tradition of historical scholarship: \\"... medieval traditional poetic narratives contained allusions to verifiable historical events [although] their history was not such as Tacitus, Bede, or C. V. Wedgwood might have written.\\" In 1946 she translated Elias Canetti's Die Blendung, as Auto-da-F√©, under the author's supervision, though a modern scholar who considers Wedgwood's work on it \\"ordinarily quite excellent\\" doubts Canetti reviewed it in detail. He suspects she hesitated to present discussions of misogyny and antisemitism quite openly. Her book The Last of the Radicals (1951), was about her uncle Josiah Wedgwood, 1st Baron Wedgwood. She completed just one volume of her planned Short History of the World (1985) before illness prevented her from continuing the project. Her essays, many later published in small collections, appeared originally in Lady Rhondda's Time and Tide where she held editor posts from 1944 to 1952, and in the Times Literary Supplement, the Spectator, and other periodicals. Garrett Mattingly praised the essays in Truth and Opinion (1960) for \\"displaying (or concealing, rather, but always molded and controlled by) that exquisite sense of form, in a medium apparently almost formless, which is the first-rate essayist's most precious gift.\\" Honours Her biography William the Silent was awarded the 1944 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. The Netherlands awarded her the Order of Orange-Nassau. She received honorary degrees from the universities of Glasgow and Sheffield and from Smith College, and was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton from 1952 to 1966. She was elected an honorary fellow of her Oxford college, Lady Margaret Hall. In the United States she was elected a member of the Academy of Arts and Letters (1966), a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1973), and the American Philosophical Society. She received the Goethe Medal in 1958. She was created a CBE in 1956, an DBE in 1968, and in 1969, not yet sixty, became the third woman to be appointed a member of the British Order of Merit. She termed the last of these honours \\"excessive\\". Personal life She was active in numerous societies, including the London arm of the International Pen Club in London, where she was president from 1951‚Äì57, as well as the Society of Authors (president, 1972‚Äì1977) and the London Library. She was appointed as the non-legal member on the Judicial Committee advising Home Secretary on deprivation of citizenship in 1948.Patrick Weil and Nicholas Handler, 'Revocation of Citizenship and Rule of Law: How Judicial Review Defeated Britain‚Äôs First Denaturalization Regime' (2018) 36(2) LHR 295, 341. She served on the Arts Council from 1958 to 1961 and the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1960‚Äì1969, and was twice a trustee of the National Gallery (1962‚Äì1968 and 1969‚Äì1976), and its first female trustee. She was a member of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts from 1953 to 1978 and president of the English Association for 1955‚Äì56. She was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1975. In 1966 she was one of 49 writers who signed a letter appealing to the Soviet Union for the release of Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel from imprisonment based on the \\"literary and artistic merits\\" of their work and rejecting the characterisation of it as \\"propaganda\\". In her later years she was an admirer of Margaret Thatcher. Her grave at Alciston Church in East Sussex In her last years she suffered from Alzheimer's disease. She died on 9 March 1997 at St Thomas' Hospital in London. She was a lesbian, her partner of almost 70 years, Jacqueline Hope-Wallace, who had a career in the British civil service, survived her. Wedgwood and Hope-Wallace owned a country house together near Polegate in Sussex. Both came from musical families. Wedgwood's father was cousin to Vaughan Williams and the dedicatee of his London Symphony. Hope-Wallace's brother Philip was for various periods music and drama critic of the Times, Times and Tide and the Manchester Guardian. She edited a collection of his writings as Words and Music (1981) for which Wedgwood wrote the introduction.Jacqueline Hope-Wallace, ed., Words and Music: A Selection from the Criticism and Occasional Pieces of Philip Hope-Wallace, introduction by C.

Edgar Weston, was a stamp dealer in Stockwell, London, then Twickenham, who used the pseudonym Victor Marsh and who purchased Jean-Baptiste Moens' stock of philatelic literature after Moens retirement in about 1907. Weston claimed to have the world's largest stock of philatelic literature for sale. He was also a prolific producer of philatelic covers using cut-outs from stamped to order postal stationery items.

Weston writes that on numerous occasions he received envelopes franked with cut-outs and in 1909 he had the idea of several different stamps being embossed together. He enquired of the Inspector of Stamping and much to his surprise discovered that his request could be complied with. So he embarked on ordering multiple embossing of stamps on sheets and then cutting them up into pairs and other multiples and using them on envelopes. From 1910 to 1915 he placed twelve orders which were supplied to him. Then the order he placed in May 1916 was refused, the Post Office stated that they had \\"decided to discontinue that particular form of stamping\\". Weston was not the only philatelist who created philatelic covers using cut- outs, but he appears to be the only one who took the initiative to order stamped to order embossed stamps on sheets and produce covers using cut-outs from these sheets. Weston was not shy in seeking co-operation in the creation of items he could sell, sending packets of covers franked with cut-outs to serving British army officers during World War One, and over an extended period to the post office at Tristan da Cunha,\\"The postal stationery cut-out\\" by Colin Baker in British Philatelic Bulletin, Vol.46, No.1, September 2008, pp.20‚Äì23. with requests that they be posted back, suitably cancelled.

Writing for The Independent, Tim O'Hagan, an Emeritus Professor at the University of East Anglia argued that central to Hollis's rationalism was \\"the epistemological unity of mankind\\", the view that \\"some beliefs are universal ... There are, because there have to be, percepts and concepts shared by all who can understand each other.\\" This rationalism, of Hollis, was in its early formulations strongly influenced by Peter Strawson and applied to understanding and explaining the approach of the social sciences.Timothy O'Hagan, Obituary: Professor Martin Hollis, The Independent, Wednesday, 11 March 1998 Biography Martin Hollis was the son of a diplomat, and nephew of the MI5 director-general Roger Hollis. Educated at Winchester, he did national service in the Royal Artillery before reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at New College, Oxford from 1958 to 1961. From 1961 to 1963 he studied at Berkeley and Harvard on a Harkness Fellowship, encountering sociology in California and the work of Quine and Rawls at Harvard, and meeting his future wife Patricia Wells, subsequently Baroness Hollis of Heigham. Returning to England, Hollis worked from 1963 to 1966 at the Foreign Office. \\"Sent to Heidelberg to learn German, he returned to find himself posted to Moscow. This was the last straw for a rational man, who was already moonlighting in Oxford, giving philosophy tutorials at New College and Balliol. He left the FCO.\\" Appointed to a philosophy post at the new University of East Anglia in 1967, he remained in Norwich until his death. In 1972 he became Senior Lecturer, and in 1981 Professor. From 1980 to 1987 he was editor of Ratio. He combined teaching and research with an increasing level of university administration, becoming Pro-Vice-Chancellor of the University in 1992. For ten years he was also a Norwich JP. Hollis was also a keen player of games. He played chess at a high level, competitive bridge, and was also interested in designing new games. All of this was not just a hobby but derived from his interest in rationality and choice, and the paradoxes that rationality throws up, something he increasingly explored in his later work. He was also fond of puzzles, especially creating logic puzzles, and published them prolifically in a variety of publications including Cogito and New Scientist.

In this period, Rao became an expert on the Sino-Indian border dispute and was seen as a key player in the revitalization of Sino-Indian ties. She was a member of the delegation led by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi when he made his historic visit to Beijing in December 1988. Her interest in Tibetan affairs was consolidated with visits to the Tibet Autonomous Region, including the leading of a group of Indian pilgrims to the holy sites of Mt.

Following her stint at Harvard, Rao served as Minister for Press, Information and Culture at the Indian Embassy in Washington D.C. from 1993 to 1995. = Ambassador of India to Peru and Bolivia = Rao's first Ambassadorship was to Peru with concurrent accreditation to Bolivia, serving from 1995 to 1998. Her tenure saw the first ever visit by a sitting Indian President to Peru, when K.R. Narayanan visited in April/May 1998.

In 2001, Rao became the official spokesperson for the MEA with her appointment as Joint Secretary, External Publicity Division (XP). Rao was the first, and so far only, female spokesperson for the MEA. Rao's tenure as spokesperson coincided with several significant events, including the July 2001 Agra Summit between India and Pakistan, and the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and the subsequent standoff between India and Pakistan. This was a period during which the spokesperson's office gave frequent live briefings for the electronic and print media, both national and international and also began to post the complete transcripts of briefings on the website of the MEA, a practice that has since become institutionalized. From 2002 to 2004, Rao served as Additional Secretary, Administration (MEA Chief of Personnel). During this period she was also Foreign Service Inspector. In 2003, on the initiative of the then National Security Advisor and Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Brajesh Mishra, Rao became a member of the Special Representative's delegation for border talks with China.

Her tenure in Sri Lanka saw the devastating tsunami of December 2004 with Rao overseeing and administering the relief operations launched by India for the affected areas of Sri Lanka, including the war torn North and East of the country where she visited Jaffna, Batticaloa and other towns including relief camps. (The Indian Army, Navy and Air Force were extensively involved in the relief operations; they were returning to the island nation for the first time after the withdrawal of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 1990. The Indian Army's restoration of transportation links in Arugam Bay after the deployment of five Bailey Bridges is particularly remembered. The operations by the Indian Navy to clear the Galle and Colombo harbors after the tsunami won special praise from the Sri Lankan government. The Indian government's relief efforts as first responder after the tsunami were widely praised in Sri Lanka for their promptness, efficacy and reach. During this period, Rao was also witness to significant internal political developments in Sri Lanka, including the assassination of Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar (Rao was the last foreigner to see Kadirgamar before his assassination) and the election of Mahinda Rajapaksa as President of the country. = Ambassador of India to China = In 2006, she became India's first woman Ambassador to China. Her tenure saw state visits by President Hu Jintao to India and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to China. The Indian Consulate General in Guangzhou was opened during her tenure in October 2007 by the then External Affairs Minister, Pranab Mukherjee. In 2007, Rao took the initiative to expand the Cultural Wing of the Embassy of India, transforming it into a hub for cultural activities including lectures, seminars, music and dance recitals and classes for Chinese students interested in Indian culture. The India-China Business Forum was also set up during this time, enabling a sharper focus on business-related activities concerning trade and investment between India and China. In 2009, at Rao's initiative, India sponsored a farmers‚Äô training and information center in the far western province of Ningxia, a low income area. This was a first in the history of India-China relations. The construction of an Indian- style Buddhist temple at the ancient town of Luoyang in central China proceeded with rapidity during this period. Rao's tenure also witnessed the devastating Sichuan earthquake in the summer of 2008, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics. Following this, the Indian government announced relief worth 5 million U.S. dollars for the victims. Rao visited the earthquake affected city of Chengdu soon after the earthquake to coincide with the arrival of Indian Air Force aircraft bringing relief supplies. Rao's being summoned to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the early hour of 2 a.m on 21 March 2008 during disturbances in Tibet was the subject of considerable focus and criticism in the Indian media. = Foreign Secretary of India = Rao became India's second woman Foreign Secretary, succeeding Shivshankar Menon, on 1 August 2009. President Obama Shakes Hands With Rao, in Washington, D.C., 2010 On 21 December 2010, the Government of India approved the extension of Rao's tenure as India's Foreign Secretary until 31 July 2011. The two-year tenure for Indian Foreign Secretaries was instituted during Rao's term of office as Foreign Secretary. During her tenure Rao was active in handling India's relations with its neighbors and with the United States, Russia and Japan, besides multilateral issues including nuclear energy cooperation as well as climate change. In this period, India was elected to a two-year term as non- permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. Rao's handling of India-Pakistan related issues received considerable attention in the media. She was also instrumental in the setting up of the Indian Consulates General in Jaffna and Hambantota in Sri Lanka, with External Affairs Minister S.M. Krishna publicly commending her for her role in the process. Rao also steered two Conferences of Indian Heads of Mission during her tenure. Rao made special efforts to augment and intensify the activities of the Public Diplomacy Division of the Ministry of External Affairs increasing its outreach significantly. She was a pioneer among senior officers of the Government of India in the use of social media, establishing her Twitter account in February 2011. During the evacuation of Indians at the time of the Libyan crisis Rao was commended for using her Twitter account (https://twitter.com/NMenonRao) to regularly update the public about the evacuation and also to respond to requests for help from stranded Indians in Libya. As of June 2019, she has over 1.4 million followers on Twitter. In 2010, while she was Foreign Secretary, Rao delivered the Harish Mahindra lecture at Harvard University and in 2011, the inaugural lecture for the Singapore Consortium for India-China Dialogue. She also received the KPS Menon Award in 2010 and also the Sree Chithira Thirunal Award in 2011. = Ambassador of India to the United States of America = She was appointed as Ambassador of India to the US after completion of her tenure as Foreign Secretary. She served a tenure as ambassador in the United States from September 2011 to November 2013. Secretary Clinton Meets With Indian Ambassador Rao, in 2012. Rao played a strong advocacy role for the bilateral relationship, being active in several public fora, including many leading U.S. universities, radio and TV shows, and in the print media where she authored op-eds on gender issues in India, IPR issues concerning pharmaceuticals, and on the growth of the India-U.S. strategic partnership. She interacted frequently with several Indian American community organizations across the length and breadth of the United States. She was particularly active in her outreach to the members of the Senate and House Caucuses on India and Indian Americans in both Houses of the U.S. Congress. This period also saw the visit of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Washington in September 2013, two meetings of the India-U.S. Strategic Dialogue, and several ministerial-level interactions between the two countries. One of her specific mission goals was to see the actualization of a long-standing goal for India to acquire a property for housing an Indian Cultural Center in Washington. Her tenure saw the purchase by the Indian Government (ending a quest that had lasted for close to four decades) of a property in downtown Washington D.C. to house the Center. Rao had consistently held that the fascination in the United States for Indian culture, the arts and letters of India, music and dance could be effectively leveraged to secure a deeper understanding and partnership. During her term, the Indian Embassy residence in Washington became a hub of several high-profile cultural events drawing the elite of the city to the Embassy and thereby significantly enhancing India's outreach in the city. Her efforts also led to the inscribing of the Embassy residence in the register of historical (heritage) residences in the upscale Cleveland Park neighborhood of the city. =Writing career= She has written a book of poetry, named Rain Rising.India‚Äôs New Ambassador to China Takes Charge Indian Embassy Her poems have been translated into Chinese and Russian. A Malayalam translation of her book \\"Rain Rising\\" was released by Calicut University in June 2013. On the completion of her tenure as Ambassador of India to the United States in November 2013, Brown University announced that Nirupama Rao would be the Meera and Vikram Gandhi Fellow in residence at the University during 2014. During the year, Rao was engaged in research and writing on select foreign policy issues during this period. She has since completed her fellowship at Brown University. She has led a seminar course on \\"India in the World\\" at Brown University in 2015. The course covers several key areas of India's foreign policy and global interaction. In November 2014, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, New Delhi announced the conferment of the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship on Nirupama Rao in connection with her book project (currently in writing) entitled \\"The Politics of History: India and China, 1949 to 1962\\". The book will be a diplomatic/political history of the relations between India and China in the crucial decade leading to the brief border-related conflict of 1962. In retirement, Rao has been active on the lecture circuit in several universities and institutions of higher learning. =Awards= Nirupama Rao was conferred the degree of Doctor of Letters (Honoris Causa) by the Pondicherry University at their Convocation in May 2012. She has also been named (2012) to the global list of the One Hundred Most Influential Women on Twitter by ForeignPolicy.com.

Several children were among the 65 wounded in the attack, which was targeted at Civil Guards, their family members and citizens, instead of only officers as ETA targets in most of its attacks.

Occurrence About 120 people, one-third of them children, were sleeping in the building when the bomb went off at around 4:00 am local time (0200 UTC), blowing off most of its facade. The blast also left a two-metre (six-foot) deep crater in the street outside the barracks and heavily damaged the 14 storey residential complex and other buildings in the area.The Guardian Aftermath The day after the bombing, a car bomb explosion on the island of Majorca killed two civil guards, Carlos S√°enz de Tejada Garc√≠a, 28, and Diego Salva Lezaun, 26.

He was named a People's Artist of the USSR. He is best known for his Muqam melodies, often composing in 12 muqams. Notable compositions include Nazugum, regarded as the first Uyghur opera, Zolotyegorye (The Golden Mountains) (1960) and his Taklimakan symphony. Biography Kuzhamyarov was born on May 21, 1918, in the modern village of Kaynazar in Enbekshikazakh District, Almaty Region, Kazakhstan. His father died when he was just 3 months old. From a young age he was distinguished by discipline, commitment, lack of youthful frivolity and common weaknesses. He did not smoke, drink and was innocent of the temptations in life. Kuzhamyarov was admitted to the College of Music and Drama in Alma-Ata, despite not yet being 16 years old. First he went to college studying the violin, then switched to the piano, where he began composing music. He passed the examinations for the composition faculty of the Moscow Conservatory. However, due to World War II he had to postpone his studies; he was drafted into the army. In 1943, he joined the Communist Party. After demobilization, he returned to Alma-Ata and in 1951 he graduated from the Alma-Ata Conservatory, under professor Yevgeny Brusilovsky, who cited Kuzhamyarov as a very important Uyghur musician. He finally left Alma-Ata and attended the Moscow Conservatory in the class of Professor V. Shebalin from 1953. He taught in the years 1957‚Äì1967 years and became rector of the Alma-Ata State Conservatory in 1968, receiving the title of professor in 1965.–ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å–∫–∞—è –°–°–†: –∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è / –ì–ª. —Ä–µ–¥. –†. –ù. –ù—É—Ä–≥–∞–ª–∏–µ–≤ ‚Äî –ê–ª–º–∞-–ê—Ç–∞: –ì–ª. —Ä–µ–¥. –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å–∫–æ–π —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏–∏, 1991. ‚Äî –¢. 4: –Ø–∑—ã–∫. –õ–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–∞. –§–æ–ª—å–∫–ª–æ—Ä. –ò—Å–∫—É—Å—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –ê—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞. ‚Äî –°. 338-339. ‚Äî 31 300 —ç–∫–∑. ‚Äî .

He composed many chamber, instrumental and choral works, songs and ballads and music for dramatic productions.

Makrani and his tribe fought for territories and resources, receiving tribute from the Nawabs of Kathiawar in return. The ascension of Makrani's tribe troubled Imperialists, who sought to disarm and disable his tribe; a false reason was given when Makrani and his tribe rejected Government social workers entering their homes on the pretense of registration and census. Given the option of armistice or dissension, the tribe rebelled. Makrani's small army with civilian support overcame British Imperialist forces, with many fatalities. British Imperialist forces ultimately failed to counter Makrani's army, although announced a bounty of Rs1,000/- and a 20-acre (81,000 m2) land reward for his head. =Return home= The stone dropped on Makrani, preserved next to his grave. In October 1887, Makrani's companions suggested returning to Makran to ease British pressure in Kathiawar. Accepting the advice, the tribe moved onto Ahmedabad and then to Sindh. A camel herder agreed to transport him to Makran, yet sought to betray him in return for the bounty reward; Makrani slewed him and fled. Makrani was later captured unconscious after being brought down by a falling stone, and after a short mock trial was sentenced to death. Death Final resting place of Kadu Makrani. Kadu Makrani was executed in the Karachi central jail in November 1887. He was buried in Mewah Shah Graveyard. In popular culture In 1960, Sadhana Chitra Film Company (India) made a Gujarati film titled \\"Kadu Makrani\\" to pay tribute to Makrani, directed by Manhar Rangildas Raskapur starring Arvind Ganpatram Pandya in the lead role of Makrani.

Ben Moubamba stood again as a candidate in the August 2016 presidential election, placing a distant third with about 0.5% of the vote. Following the election, in which Ali Bongo Ondimba was re-elected, Ben Moubamba was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Urban Development and Housing on 3 October 2016. When a new government was formed on 21 August 2017, in the wake of a dialogue between the governing majority and some elements of the opposition, he retained his ministerial portfolio, but with the less prestigious rank of Minister of State. He was dismissed from the government soon afterward, on 7 September 2017, due to his criticism of other members of the government, culminating in a critical post to social media about Prime Minister Emmanuel Issoze Ngondet.Mathieu Olivier, \\"Gabon : Bruno Ben Moubamba limog√© sans surprise du gouvernement\\", Jeune Afrique, 8 September 2017 .

The character first appeared on- screen in December 2008. He initially appeared as the former foster brother of Warren Fox, turning up after the death of his mother. He is noted for his learning disability and his condition of where he has a mental age of a human in preadolescence. The character was axed by Paul Marquess. Character creation=Background= News of the character first surfaced in October 2008, when it was announced established character Warren Fox was to have a new on-screen relative in the form of Spencer, his former foster brother from his childhood. He was initially dubbed as being introduced to explore the character of Warren's past in more depth. It was also made clear that the character would have learning disabilities and a mental age of a 10-year-old. When the character first appeared on-screen, the two characters spoke of their troubled pasts and Spencer pleaded with Warren to look after him. Spencer was later cared for by Warren's girlfriend Sasha Valentine and her family, leaving the village with them when they departed. =Casting= Auditions were held for the part of Spencer with actor Darren John Langford going onto secure the role. The part was Langford's first major television role after appearing in television commercials and theatre roles prior to the casting. Langford also credited his early chemistry with Jamie Lomas during the audition process as helping him settle into the role. In early 2010, it was announced that Lucy Allan had stepped down from the position of executive producer and that Paul Marquess had taken over the role. It was soon revealed that Marquess planned to give Hollyoaks a \\"shake up\\", changing the productions team and beginning a cast cull by axing three established characters. Stephanie Waring (who plays Cindy Hutchinson) then revealed that all remaining cast members feared their character would be axed. One month later, Marquess announced his plans to axe a further 11 characters, including Spencer at the end of Langford's contract. Development=Personality and identity= Spencer's personality is unique as it sometimes corresponds with his learning disabilities. He can sometimes act child like as his mental age is at the age of ten years. Fellow cast members have previously commented that the character is portrayed to show him doing what a normal characters in their twenties do, yet in a 'less adult way'. =Warren's \\"death\\"= When his only relative in the series was killed off after Jamie Lomas quit the series, it was confirmed that Spencer would not be leaving. A transition in the character that saw him being more independent as a character with his new-found responsibilities such as owning two businesses and a home. At the time of character Warren's funeral, Spencer was seen refusing to believe his death had taken place. This clearly showed Spencer unwillingness to accept his death because he was easily manipulated by Ash Roy, who used his learning difficulties to his advantage. Of the scenes, Langford said: \\"He's focused on the fact that there's a coffin and Warren's inside it. He actually doesn't believe he's dead. He just starts banging on the coffin. The thought of Warren waking up alone in the dark is terrifying.\\" After this point the character's behaviour became more erratic and lost control; he was sent into sheltered accommodation to be looked after. Following a brief hiatus from the series, he returned determined to be more independent. This was shown when he began to help with the reconstruction of The Loft, a big turning point in the character's direction. Storylines=2008‚Äì2010= Warren found it hard to cope with him, but Spencer has begged Warren not to hand him over to Social Services. Warren promised to look after him and told him he loved him as a brother. Warren asked him to become his best-man at his wedding to Louise Summers. He became friends with Sasha Valentine who helped Warren look after him. Spencer went into Warren's car after he shouted at him, Warren then hit Spencer in public viewing. Spencer later began walking the village where Theresa McQueen, Anita Roy and Lauren Valentine got him to buy alcohol. Warren was later accused of murder and began losing his temper even more, Spencer then stood up to him telling him to leave Sasha alone. This resulted in Warren hitting Spencer again, at this point Spencer left home and asked Sasha to leave, however she could not as she loved him. Warren later regretted it and asked Spencer to forgive him. Calvin met Spencer and offered him to stay at his house. After Warren's death, Spencer regretted leaving home and admitted to Carmel that he loved him. In episodes after Warren's solicitor informed Spencer that Warren had left The Loft, Evissa and his flat to him in his will. Spencer was fooled into selling The Loft to Ash Roy after he tricked Spencer into believing that Warren was still alive and that he wanted Spencer to sell The Loft. On the day of Warren's funeral Spencer initially refused to go because of bad memories from his mother funeral, he later was convinced to go and during the service Spencer had a dramatic 'episode' and banged on the coffin begging him to wake up. Ash was found out and the deed was shredded. Calvin began struggling to cope with Spencer and his unruly behaviour. Realising he can not go on, Calvin organised Spencer to be put into a home however when Sasha returned from visiting her brother she offered Spencer a room back at the valentines he declined saying he liked where he lived now. In late 2009, after a brief hiatus, Spencer became friends with students India Longford and Dave Colburn. Dave used Spencer by getting free drinks off him when Calvin caught him out they argued about how Calvin too uses Spencer for his businesses this resulted in Calvin punching Dave. Meanwhile, Spencer developed a crush on India but when she turned him down Spencer picked up a live firework which burnt his hand. In March 2010 Spencer was revealed to be the person who was looking after Holly Hutchinson after she ran away from home. When he sees Jake Dean being pulled away by the police, Spencer feels guilty, so he confides in Calvin on what he should do. Calvin says that he shouldn't confess to the police about the situation or else he will get into trouble. When Calvin's interviewed about his involvement in Warren's death, he let slip about Spencer's involvement in Holly's disappearance. This then leads to Spencer being interrogated by the police at the station, where his inability to defend himself worsens however all charges are dropped. Spencer makes a close friendship with Lauren Valentine and Gaz Bennett however they are using him for his money. Lauren gets Spencer drunk then makes him believe they slept together. However she lies to him to that she's pregnant with his child and that he has to give her ¬£2000 to make have a termination, when she's actually trying to con him out of his inheritance with Gaz, so that she can run away with him. Spencer panics and tells Sasha about the situation and she believes Gaz is the father, meaning that Spencer didn't explain the whole story about him and Lauren. Although everyone believes that Gaz got Lauren pregnant, they are not aware she is not pregnant at all, however Gaz and Lauren have no choice but to continue with their plan. Spencer breaks up his friendship and falls out with Calvin after he discovers that Calvin left Warren to die in the fire and didn't help him. A few weeks later, Calvin is shot dead by Theresa McQueen, which devastated Spencer as he had always looked to Calvin as a big brother. Three months later, the Valentines decided to make a fresh start out of Hollyoaks and so decide to take Spencer with them. They left on 13 August 2010. In October 2010 Warren returned to Hollyoaks after being dead for the last year and it has been told that Spencer has been told but has not returned to see him. Nine years later, it was reveal that Warren has been staying with him along with his twins Sophie and Sebastian, so that the twins mother Sienna will not find them. Reception Kris Green of media reporting website Digital Spy spoke of his admiration for the character when he praised actor Langford for his portrayal and his chemistry with Jamie Lomas (Warren), saying: \\"Spencer is a fascinating character - a character whom you can't take your eyes off when he's on screen. Langford has the part down to a tee and they certainly have the chemistry between them just right.\\" He also praised episodes the character appeared in as \\"unmissable\\". Fellow cast member Nathalie Emmanuel, who plays Sasha Valentine in the series, has spoken about how Langford captured the character of Spencer amazingly in the way that he's not made out to be 'childlike', stating: \\"Even though Spencer has the mental age of a child, he still comes across like a 24-year-old guy.\\" In 2009 Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture who runs a monthly feature of the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, profiled Spencer, calling him an irritating character, also stating: \\"So good he doesn‚Äôt have a surname, with some sort of learning difficulty that‚Äôs also as-yet unnamed, Spencer‚Äôs only purpose seems to be to make Warren sympathetic. [...] Hollyoaks has questionable morality at the best of times, and we‚Äôd maybe forgive them the addition of Spencer if he was a well-acted likeable character with a specific difficulty that was portrayed accurately. But instead, it‚Äôs just a case of epic fail all round.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Spencer Gray on the E4 website Hollyoaks characters Television characters introduced in 2008 Male characters in television ","title":"Spencer Gray"},{"id":"23786610","text":"\\"Pozdrav svijetu\\" (English translation: \\"Greetings to the world\\") was the Yugoslavian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1969, performed in Serbo- Croatian by Ivan and the band M¬¥s (consisted of Branko Maru≈°iƒá, Sa≈°a Sabliƒá and ≈Ωeljko Ru≈æiƒá).

The territory lies between 20¬∞ west and 45¬∞ east, between the claimed British Antarctic Territory to the west and the similarly claimed Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until 12 June 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (1869‚Äì1938). Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was the first person known to have set foot in the territory, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the Antarctic Treaty System, making it a demilitarised zone. It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway, the other being Peter I Island. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo. Most of the territory is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed and the growth of a limited flora. The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The waters off the coast are called the King Haakon VII Sea. There is no permanent population, although there are 12 active research stations housing a maximum of around 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating depending on the season. Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with Cape Town, South Africa, are Troll Airfield, near the Norwegian Troll research station, and a runway at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.  Geography  The Drygalski Mountains, a constituent range of the Orvin Mountains Queen Maud Land extends from the boundary with Coats Land in the west to the boundary with Enderby Land in the east, and is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. The territory is estimated to cover around . The limits of the claim, put forth in 1939, did not fix the northern and southern limits other than as \\"the mainland beach in Antarctica ... with the land that lies beyond this beach and the sea beyond\\".At the time of the claim, Norway did not validate the sector method of demarcating polar territory. This was in line with Norwegian claims in the Arctic and hence to avoid compromising Norway's position with regard to the former Soviet Union and present-day Russia. In the 2015 White Paper No. 32 (2014‚Äì2015) \\"Norwegian Interests and Policy in Antarctica\\" the Foreign Ministry confirmed that while Norway rejected the sector method of delimiting claims it was not intended create a difference in interpreation of the Norwegian claim in the Antarctica; White Paper No. 19 (1939) had stated that the purpose of the annexation was to annex \\"land which is currently terra nullius and that only Norwegians have researched and mapped\\". The sea that extends off the coast between the longitudal limits of Queen Maud Land is generally called King Haakon VII Sea.Stonehouse, pp. 155‚Äì156. There is no ice-free land at the coast; the coast consists of a wall of ice throughout almost the entire territory. It is thus only possible to disembark from a ship in a few places. Some from the coast, rocky peaks pierce the ice cap, itself at a mean height of around above sea level, with the highest point at J√∏kulkyrkja () in the M√ºhlig-Hofmann Mountains. The other major mountain ranges are the Heimefront Range, Orvin Mountains, Wohlthat Mountains and S√∏r Rondane Mountains. Geologically, the ground of Queen Maud Land is dominated by Precambrian gneiss, formed c. 1 to 1.2 Ga, before the creation of the supercontinent Gondwana. The mountains consist mostly of crystalline and granitic rocks, formed c. 500 to 600 Ma in the Pan-African orogeny during the assembly of Gondwana. In the farthest western parts of the territory, there are younger sedimentary and volcanic rocks. Research on the thickness of the ice has revealed that without the ice, the coast would be similar to those of Norway and Greenland, with deep fjords and islands.  History =Early activity= Queen Maud Land was the first part of Antarctica to be sighted, on 27 January 1820 by Fabian von Bellingshausen. It was however among the last to be explored, as it required aircraft in combination with ships to undertake systematic exploration.Mills, 2003, p. 540. Early Norwegian research activities in Antarctica rested entirely on whaling and sealing expeditions funded by ship owners, particularly by Christen Christensen and his son Lars. The first two Norwegian expeditions were carried out by sealing ships in 1892‚Äì93 and 1893‚Äì94. While they were primarily sent for exploring, sealing, and whaling possibilities, they also performed scientific research.Heldal, 2011, p. 10. Further Norwegian expeditions were mounted into the first decades of the 20th century. The Antarctic Plateau was claimed for Norway by Roald Amundsen as the King Haakon VII Plateau when his expedition was the first to reach the South Pole on 14 December 1911. It was mapped as a circular territory comprising the plateau around the South Pole, including all the land above latitude 85¬∞S. However, roughly the same area had been claimed by the British as the King Edward VII Plateau, which was in conflict with the Norwegian claim. Amundsen's claim has never been officially claimed by the Norwegian government.Joyner, 1992, p. 47. Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen, aviator and polar explorer who explored much of Queen Maud Land. The name Queen Maud Land was initially applied in January 1930 to the land between 37¬∞E and 49¬∞30‚Ä≤E discovered by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn L√ºtzow-Holm during Lars Christensen's Norvegia expedition of 1929‚Äì30. It was named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales, wife of the then-reigning King Haakon VII. The territory was explored further during the Norvegia expedition of 1930‚Äì31. During this whaling season, a total of 265 whaling ships, mostly Norwegian, worked off the coast of Queen Maud Land.Rubin, 2008, p. 304. In the same season, Riiser-Larsen discovered the Prince Olav Coast, Princess Martha Coast and Princess Ragnhild Coast from the air. Captain H. Halvorsen of the whaler Sevilla discovered the Princess Astrid Coast independently at the same time. Six years later, during Christensen's expedition of 1936‚Äì37, Viggo Wider√∏e flew over and discovered the Prince Harald Coast. Negotiations with the British government in 1938 resulted in the western border of Queen Maud Land being set at 20¬∞W. Norway's claim was disputed by Germany, which in 1938 dispatched the German Antarctic Expedition, led by Alfred Ritscher, to fly over as much of it as possible. The ship Schwabenland reached the pack ice off Antarctica on 19 January 1939.Murphy, 2002, p. 192. During the expedition, an area of about was photographed from the air by Ritscher,Murphy, 2002, p. 204. who dropped darts inscribed with swastikas every . Germany eventually attempted to claim the territory surveyed by Ritscher under the name New Swabia, but lost any claim to the land following its defeat in the Second World War. On 14 January 1939, five days prior to the German arrival, Queen Maud Land was annexed by Norway, by royal decree: The primary basis for the annexation were the Norwegian explorations and the need to secure the Norwegian whaling industry's access to the region. Scientific operations were also a basis, with Norwegian contributions to international polar science extending back to the late 19th century. Norway was in addition forced to contend with competing claims made by the United Kingdom and other countries in the years prior to the Norwegian claim, including the new threat of German claims in Queen Maud Land. The Norwegian claim was sometimes referred to as the \\"Bouvet sector\\", drawing from the previously annexed Bouvet Island. During 1946 and 1947, vast areas of Queen Maud Land were photographed during the Richard Evelyn Byrd expedition. In 1948, Norway and the United Kingdom agreed to limit Queen Maud Land to longitudes from 20¬∞W to 45¬∞E, and that the Bruce Coast and Coats Land were to be incorporated into Norwegian territory. =Later developments= Lake Untersee in Queen Maud Land. View from NW to Mt. Bastei. The Norwegian‚ÄìBritish‚ÄìSwedish Antarctic Expedition of 1949‚Äì52 was the first international scientific expedition in Antarctica. The expedition established its winter quarters at a base called Maudheim at 71¬∞S, 11¬∞W, and mapped much of western Queen Maud Land. During the International Geophysical Year (1957‚Äì1958), year-round stations were established in Queen Maud Land by Norway, the Soviet Union, Belgium and Japan. The Norwegian expedition continued with topographical mapping, while the others started geophysical and geological research. Norway's Norway Station was lent to South Africa following the withdrawal of the Norwegian expedition in 1960. South Africa later built the SANAE station, near the now-defunct Norway Station. The Soviet Union, and later Russia, has maintained continual operations, although it moved from Lazarev Station to Novolazarevskaya Station. Japan has been based at its Showa Station since 1957, except for a hiatus of a few years. Belgium closed its King Baudouin Station in 1961, though it mounted limited operations in cooperation with the Netherlands in 1964‚Äì66. The United States established the temporary Plateau Station in 1966. In 1948, the newly created Norwegian Polar Institute was assigned the administration of Norwegian territories in the Arctic and Antarctic, including Queen Maud Land.Heldal, 2011, p. 11. Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but its efforts declined after that. On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian sovereignty as a dependency (biland), and the Antarctic Treaty officially came into force on 23 June 1961. Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern Weddell Sea by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976‚Äì77. Founded in 1978, the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and the Police, headquartered in Oslo, has been assigned the administration of the Norwegian polar areas including Queen Maud Land. Since 1979, the Norwegian Polar Institute has been a directorate under the Ministry of the Environment. Norway's main research station, Troll, in Queen Maud Land. In 1992, an expedition by Ivar Tollefsen made the first ascents of several mountains, including the tallest, J√∏kulkyrkja. Norway established the summer station Troll in 1989‚Äì90. In 2003, Minister of the Environment B√∏rge Brende was the first Norwegian minister to visit Queen Maud Land, and he soon allocated funds to expand the Troll station. Troll was upgraded to a year- round station in 2005 as part of the centenary of Norway's independence. Among the guests were Minister of Foreign Affairs Jan Petersen and Minister of the Environment Knut Arild Hareide, and Troll was officially opened by Queen Sonja of Norway, the first queen to ever visit Antarctica.Rubin, 2008, p. 305. In 2008, Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg, accompanied by forty officials, scientists and reporters, became the first Norwegian prime minister to visit Queen Maud Land. He personally named three mountains around the Troll station where he was based, although he chose to sleep outdoors in a tent, rather than in a bed inside. He said the purposes of the visit were to claim Norway's possessions in Antarctica, as well as to learn more about the climate research at Troll, which he said was key to better understanding of global climate change. In 2015, King Harald V became the world's first reigning monarch to visit Antarctica when he went to Queen Maud Land.  Legal status  The locations of Norway (yellowish white) and Queen Maud Land (red stripes). This map in Winkel tripel projection distorts sizes; Antarctica is much smaller than it appears here. Like all other territorial claims in Antarctica, the Norwegian claim of Queen Maud Land (along with its claim of Peter I Island) is subject to the Antarctic Treaty System. The treaty makes clear that Antarctica can only be used for peaceful purposes and assures the freedom of scientific activity. It promotes international scientific cooperation and bans any nuclear-related activities. Although territorial claims are not invalidated by the treaty, all claims under Article III of the treaty are in effect suspended as long as it is in force. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognised each other's claims in Antarctica. But there is a question on the actual boundaries of the claim, since the initial Norwegian demarcations both towards the South Pole and into the sea were left unclear. Apparently this was to avoid accepting use of the \\"sector principle\\" for Arctic Ocean claims by the Soviet Union. Norwegian administration of Queen Maud Land is controlled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, located in Oslo. The annexation of the territory is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933; Queen Maud Land was added on 21 June 1957. It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the territory, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid in the territory. Furthermore, it establishes that all the land belongs to the state, and prohibits both nuclear detonations and the storage of nuclear waste. Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. Norwegian citizens who plan activities in Queen Maud Land must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute, which may prohibit any non-compliant activity. Those who visit Queen Maud Land must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.  Fauna and flora  The snow petrel is one of the species of birds found in Queen Maud Land. There are three types of birds around Troll: the Antarctic petrel, the snow petrel and the south polar skua. The Antarctic petrel lives on the sea ice for most of the year, with the exception of its breeding season (in Antarctica, from November to February), when it moves to the inland mountains and nunataks. The area of ice-free cliffs in Princess Astrid Coast called Svarthamaren Mountain hosts Antarctica's largest known inland colony of breeding seabirds, almost 1 million (250,000 pairs) Antarctic petrels. Many snow petrels and south polar skuas also breed in this area. Snow petrels are generally spread out in smaller colonies throughout the mountainous areas of Queen Maud Land. During the breeding season, the south polar skua feeds exclusively upon the eggs, as well as both young and adult birds, of both petrel species. The emperor penguin has some of its breeding places concentrated in Queen Maud Land.Rubin, 2008, p. 120. All four of the true Antarctic seals, namely the Weddell seal, leopard seal, crabeater seal and Ross seal, can be found in the King Haakon VII Sea off Queen Maud Land.Joyner, 1992, p. 26. The Ross seal is notably found in its greatest numbers in the King Haakon VII Sea. The nunatak areas have a scarcity of flora, limited to lichen, bryophyte and algae. Flowering plants are not found there. The Norwegian Polar Institute has not registered the occurrence of any threatened or rare plants or animals in Queen Maud Land, the known ones thus existing in healthy populations.  Research stations  SANAE IV station Queen Maud Land is currently home to 12 research stations: the Norwegian Troll and Tor stations; Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station; South Africa's SANAE IV; the Swedish Wasa; the Finnish Aboa; the German Neumayer-Station III and Kohnen; India's Maitri station; the Japanese Showa Station and Dome Fuji Station; and Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Base. These stations' total summer population is approximately 494, but with considerably fewer in winter. These stations are connected by the Dronning Maud Land Air Network Project (DROMLAN), which is a cooperative agreement for transportation between eleven nations with research stations in East Antarctica. Long-range aircraft fly between Cape Town, South Africa and either the Troll Airfield, located at the Troll research station, or the runway at the Novolazarevskaya Station. From these two main airfields, smaller aircraft may fly further to other Antarctic destinations. Norway's Troll station serves as a major hub of the DROMLAN network through the Troll Airfield. Research at Troll include air and atmospheric measurements, monitoring of greenhouse gases and bird colonies, as well as meteorological and climate research. The other Norwegian station, Tor, was established for researching birds at the breeding colony in Svarthamaren Mountain. Activities conducted by Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station include environmental monitoring, geodesy/mapping, geomagnetic and meteorological observations, glaciology, biology, ionosphericauroral observations, limnology, geology, geophysics and seismology. Charnockitic rock needle, northern Holtedahlfjella, Queen Maud Land, aerial photograph in SSE direction. South Africa's SANAE IV station, the successor to three former stations, was completed in 1997. Research at SANAE IV include invasion biology/ecology, geology, geomorphology and atmospheric sciences.

The Swedish Wasa station and the Finnish Aboa station together make up the Nordenski√∂ld Base, and cooperate in research and logistics. Research carried out includes geodesy/mapping, glaciology, human biology, meteorological observations, geology and geophysics. The German Neumayer-Station III, finished in 2009, succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice. It conducts geophysical, meteorological and seismological research, as well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring. Germany's other station, Kohnen, was opened as part of a major ice-drilling project.Mills, 2003, p. 259.

A vast array of research is conducted there, including upper atmosphere physics, meteorology, seismology, gravimetry, geodesy/mapping, oceanography, glaciology, geology, marine and terrestrial biology, and medical research. Japan's other station, Dome Fuji Station was opened as part of a major ice-coring project. It mainly studies climate change and conducts deep drilling and atmospheric observations. Belgium's Princess Elisabeth Base was established as a project to promote polar sciences, as well as to demonstrate the possibility of building a zero emission station. Research is conducted by an international team of scientists, studying climatology, glaciology and microbiology.

Bouvet√∏ya is a Subantarctic island in the South Atlantic Ocean. Queen Maud Land is a sector of Antarctica which spans between the 20th meridian west and the 45th meridian east. Peter I Island is a volcanic island located off the coast of Ellsworth Land of continental Antarctica. Svalbard is not formally considered to be a dependency. While the Svalbard Treaty regulates some aspects of that Arctic territory, one article acknowledges that these islands are part of Norway. Similarly, Jan Mayen is recognized as an integral part of the nation. Both are, however, unincorporated areas. Both Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land are south of 60¬∞S and are thus part of the Antarctic Treaty System. While the treaty states that the claims are not affected by the treaty, only the other countries with claims recognize Norwegian sovereignty on the island. The dependencies are administered by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo, Norway‚Äôs capital. Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the dependencies, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on the island. Government and regulations The dependency status entails that the island is not part of the Kingdom of Norway, but is still under Norwegian sovereignty. Specifically, this implies that the island can be ceded without violating the first article of the Constitution of Norway.Gisle (1999): 38 Norwegian administration of the island is handled by the Polar Affairs Department of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, located in Oslo. The annexation of the island is regulated by the Dependency Act of 24 March 1933. It establishes that Norwegian criminal law, private law and procedural law applies to the dependencies, in addition to other laws that explicitly state they are valid on each dependency. It further establishes that all land belongs to the state, and prohibits the storage and detonation of nuclear products. Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has required all Norwegian activity in Antarctica, including Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All Norwegian citizens who plan activities must therefore report to the Norwegian Polar Institute, who may deny any non-conforming activity. All people visiting the area must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations. Bouvet√∏ya has been designated with the ISO 3166-2 code BV and was subsequently awarded the country code top-level domain on 21 August 1997.  History  * On 14 December 1911 five Norwegians, under the leadership of Roald Amundsen, were the first to reach the South Pole. * Bouvet Island was claimed in 1927 (formally in 1930; in 1935 the island was declared a nature reserve for seals). * Peter I Island was claimed in 1929 (formally in 1931). * Queen Maud Land (45¬∞E to 20¬∞E) was formally claimed as a Norwegian possession on 14 January 1938. * King Harald V became the first reigning monarch to visit Antarctica. He visited Queen Maud Land in 2015.  Areas = Bouvet√∏ya = Southeast coast of Bouvet Island in 1898 Bouvet√∏ya (Bouvet Island) is an uninhabited Subantarctic volcanic island located in the southern end of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, either in the South Atlantic Ocean or the Southern Ocean, depending on definition. It is the most remote island in the world, approximately south-southwest off the coast of South Africa and approximately north of the Princess Astrid Coast of Queen Maud Land, Antarctica. The island has an area of , of which 93 percent is covered by a glacier. The center of the island is an ice-filled crater of an inactive volcano. Some skerries and one smaller island, Lars√∏ya, lie along the coast. Nyr√∏ysa, created by a rock slide in the late 1950s, is the only easy place to land and is the location of a weather station. Landing on the island is very difficult, as it normally experiences high seas and features a steep coast.Barr (1987): 59 During the winter, it is surrounded by pack ice. The exclusive economic zone surrounding the island covers an area of . = Peter I Island = RV Polarstern in 1994. Peter I Island is a volcanic island located off the coast of Ellsworth Land of continental Antarctica. It has an area of . The island is almost entirely covered by glacier, with about 95% of the surface covered by ice.Barr (1987): 65 Surrounding the island is a tall ice front and vertical cliffs. The long stretches of ice caps are supplemented with rock outcrops. Landing is only possible at three points, and only during the short period of the year in which the island is not surrounded by pack ice. The island is a shield volcano, although it is not known if it is still active. An ultra prominent peak at elevation, it is named for Lars Christensen.LeMasurier (1990): 512 Peter I Island is the only claim within 90¬∞W and 150¬∞W and is also the only claim which is not a sector.Kyvik et.al (2008): 57 = Queen Maud Land = Norway's main research station, Troll, in Queen Maud Land. Queen Maud Land is a 2.7 million-square-kilometer (1.7 million sq mi) sector region of Antarctica. The territory lies between 20¬∞ west and 45¬∞ east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. The latitudinal limits of the territory are not officially defined. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises one-sixth of the total area of Antarctica.Mills (2003): 540. Most of the territory is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, and a tall ice wall stretches throughout its coast. In some areas further within the ice sheet, mountain ranges breach through the ice, allowing for birds to breed and the growth of a limited flora. The region is divided into the Princess Martha Coast, Princess Astrid Coast, Princess Ragnhild Coast, Prince Harald Coast and Prince Olav Coast. Off the coast is King Haakon VII Sea.Stonehouse: 155‚Äì156. There is no ice-free land at the coast; the coast consists of a wall of ice throughout almost the entire territory. There is no permanent population, although there are 12 active research stations housing a maximum average of 40 scientists, the numbers fluctuating depending on the season. Six are occupied year-round, while the remainder are seasonal summer stations. The main aerodromes for intercontinental flights, corresponding with Cape Town, South Africa, are Troll Airfield, near the Norwegian Troll research station, and a runway at the Russian Novolazarevskaya Station.Rubin (2008): 305.

Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 12th-century. Scrivener labeled it by number 572. The manuscript is lacunose. It contains liturgical books: Synaxarion and Menologion.  Description  The codex contains the text of the four Gospels on 255 parchment leaves (size ) with some lacunae (Luke 5:22-9:32; 11:31-13:25; 17:25-18:3; John 8:14-21:25).

Both exiles from Scotland, Albany and Douglas invaded with permission but not support of Richard III of England, hoping to encourage rebellion against James. Instead, they were met with armed resistance. The loyalists took the day. Douglas was captured and Albany forced to retreat.Battle of Lochmaben Fair douglashistory.co.uk. Retrieved 29 June 2013. Background The unpopular Scottish king James III had been imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle following his arrest by his own nobles at Lauder Bridge in July 1482. Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany, his younger brother, soon took control of the government, but his power was short-lived. Through bribery and the support of such powerful individuals as George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly, James III regained his throne, and Albany was forced to flee, first in January 1483 to Dunbar and then on 9 April to England. Douglas, a rebel against Albany's father James II of Scotland, had resided in England since his lands had been forfeit to the crown in 1455. There, in the employ of Edward IV of England, he had become a Knight of the Garter. Invasion The recently crowned English king Richard III initially planned to invade Scotland, but with other matters of state taking precedence instead only gave his permission for Albany and Douglas to launch an invasion on their own. The pair did so, bringing 500 horsemen to Lochmaben on 22 July 1484 during the annual fair. Though Albany and Douglas had hoped to incite the Scots to rebel against James, instead the townspeople took to arms against them, soon receiving assistance from the gentry in the area. The English cavalry routed, Albany retreated to France, while Douglas was captured. References Further reading  PRIMARY * The Auchinleck Chronicle, ed.

Life Memorial to Bishop Edmund Keene in Ely Cathedral Edmund Keene was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk in 1714, second surviving son of Charles Keene (1675‚Äì?) and Susan Rolfe (?‚Äì1753). His older brother Benjamin (1697‚Äì1757) was a distinguished diplomat and long-serving Ambassador to Spain. Both his father and uncle Benjamin served as Mayor of King's Lynn, as did his grandfather Edmund Rolfe (1640‚Äì1726). In addition, Rolfe was election agent for Sir Robert Walpole, British Prime Minister from 1721 to 1742; this connection helped the careers of both Benjamin and Edmund. In May 1752, he married Mary Andrewes (1725‚Äì1776), only child of a wealthy London merchant. They had a daughter and a son, Benjamin, MP for Cambridge from 1775 to 1784. Career Through the influence of Sir Robert Walpole, friend of the family, he was educated at Charterhouse School, and was admitted to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in 1730. He graduated B.A. in January 1734, and M.A. in 1737, having been incorporated at Oxford on 14 July 1735. From Michaelmas 1730 to Lady day 1734 he was scholar of Caius, and from Michaelmas 1736 to the same date in 1739 he was one of its junior fellows. In August 1739 he became a fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, and on 31 December 1748 was promoted to be Master of Peterhouse. For the two academic years ending November 1751 he was a reforming vice-chancellor of the university; a code of orders and regulations, proposed to the university senate on 11 May 1750, subsequently became law, and provoked an Occasional Letter to Dr. Keene, and other pamphlets. Having been ordained deacon on 18 July 1736, he held from 1740 to 1770 the rectory of Stanhope in County Durham. He made improvements to the house and gardens, and enlarged. On 22 March 1752 he was consecrated in the chapel of Ely House as bishop of Chester, but he did not resign the mastership of his college until 1754. While at Chester he rebuilt the episcopal palace; George Grenville, in December 1764, proposed that he should accept a transfer to the archiepiscopal see of Armagh, but Keene held out for the diocese of Ely. On 22 January 1771 he was confirmed as bishop of Ely. He obtained in 1772 an act of parliament for alienating from the see the ancient bishop's palace in Holborn, and for purchasing the freehold of a house in Dover Street, Piccadilly, London; the house on that site was built by him about 1776. He also rebuilt most of the palace at Ely, and furnished a gallery of portraits of its bishops from the Reformation. Many of Keene's appointments to livings did him credit, and where there was no resident incumbent he reserved to himself the right of appointing to the curacies, but he did not escape hostile criticism, and the epigrams of Thomas Gray were especially severe. He died at Ely House, Dover Street, London, on 6 July 1781 and at his own desire was buried in West's Chapel, Ely Cathedral, with a short epitaph written by himself.\\"This marble and the Inscription were placed here by the direction of Bishop Keen who in his will expressly forbad any other monument being erected to his memory.\\" Works Keene was select preacher at Whitehall Chapel in 1738, and published five sermons. He was the author of a translation of the first book of Theocritus, 'by a Gentleman,' which is inserted in John Whalley's Poems (1745), pp. 133‚Äì49. The original edition of Bentham's Ely was dedicated to him, and to it was prefixed a plate of his arms.

In geometry, Pl√ºcker's conoid is a ruled surface named after the German mathematician Julius Pl√ºcker. It is also called a conical wedge or cylindroid; however, the latter name is ambiguous, as \\"cylindroid\\" may also refer to an elliptic cylinder. Pl√ºcker's conoid is the surface defined by the function of two variables: : z=\\\\frac{2xy}{x^2+y^2}. This function has an essential singularity at the origin. By using cylindrical coordinates in space, we can write the above function into parametric equations : x=v\\\\cos u,\\\\quad y=v\\\\sin u,\\\\quad z=\\\\sin 2u. Thus Pl√ºcker's conoid is a right conoid, which can be obtained by rotating a horizontal line about the z-axis with the oscillatory motion (with period 2œÄ) along the segment [‚àí1, 1] of the axis (Figure 4). A generalization of Pl√ºcker's conoid is given by the parametric equations : x=v \\\\cos u,\\\\quad y=v \\\\sin u,\\\\quad z= \\\\sin nu. where n denotes the number of folds in the surface.

The supermarket chain named their official brand font 'Mary-Ann', used in-store, online and in advertising after her. Early and private life Staples was born on 30 June 1849 at 4 Little Charles Street (now St Joans House, Phoenix St.), Somers Town, London. Her father, Benjamin Staples, was originally a woodcarver, but in 1863 he opened a small dairy shop at 87 Chalton Street, Somers Town. Mary Ann and her two younger brothers probably helped out in this shop. At the time of her marriage to John James Sainsbury, on 20 April 1869, Mary Ann Staples was working in the dairy shop of a family friend, Tom Haile, at 32 Strutton Ground, Victoria. In 1873, the family moved to live above their second shop at 159 Queen's Crescent, Kentish Town. The area in which this branch was located was newly developed and much less overcrowded than Drury Lane. Mary Ann continued to work in the shop, but her role diminished as the size of her family grew. By the 1880s, the firm's success had made the Sainsbury family extremely prosperous. When the family moved again, in 1886, it was to a smart villa in the fashionable suburb of Highgate. Mary Ann was now devoting herself entirely to family life and none of her five daughters needed to enter the business. Business career In 1869, John James and Mary Ann Sainsbury opened a dairy shop at 173 Drury Lane, Holborn, which became the first branch of the British supermarket chain Sainsbury's. It is said that Mary Ann ran the shop at 173 Drury Lane by herself for the first few weeks it was open. This was probably so that she and her husband could rely on his wages while they built up their own trade. Meanwhile, her father, Benjamin Staples, continued to expand his chain of grocery stores. The Staples chain later grew to around six branches, many of which were later sold to Sainsbury's. A former Staples branch, at 68 Watney Street, Stepney, was sold to Sainsbury's in 1881 when John James Sainsbury purchased it from his brother in-law (Mary Ann's brother) Edward Staples. This store was the first Sainsbury's store to trial round-the-back deliveries, which was started so as to not upset an Irish competitor, Mike Drummond. The original Somers Town store was sold to Sainsbury's in 1882. Mary Ann continued to take an interest in the business, however and accompanied John James on inspections of the shops almost until her death, on 9 June 1927, at Bishopsfield, Broadlands Road, Highgate, Middlesex.

It was part of Berkshire until the 1974 Local Government Act transferred it to Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 173. In the 10th century the toponym was spelt Scaringaford and in the 11th century it was Serengeford. 13th century forms of the name included Salingeford, Schalingeford, Shallingford, Sallingford and Schillingford. In the 18th century it was recorded as Shillingworth. The spelling Shillingford has been discontinued to avoid confusion with the village of Shillingford near Wallingford, also in Oxfordshire. History Abingdon Abbey held the manor of Shellingford from 931 to 1538. In 1598 the courtier Sir Henry Neville bought the manor. It was later held by the Packer family. In 1738 Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough bought it as an investment. It was later held by the Goodlake and Ashbrook families. In the 19th century the Goodlakes built a new house to the north of the village, Kitemore House, to replace the Elizabethan manor house south of the church, which was then demolished. Between 1931 and 1957 there was an aerodrome, RAF Shellingford, between Shellingford and Stanford in the Vale. A quarry now occupies part of the site. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Faith has a late 12th century Norman nave and chancel. The church still has its Norman chancel arch, south door, priest's door and part of the north door. The west tower is an Early English Gothic addition from the early part of the 13th century. In the 14th century the chancel was rebuilt with Decorated Gothic windows and a Decorated window was inserted in the south wall of the nave. In about 1400 a chapel was added to the north side of the chancel, but it does not survive. The tower arch was rebuilt in the 15th century. Early in the 16th century two four-light Perpendicular Gothic windows were inserted in the south wall of the nave and another Perpendicular window was inserted in the north wall of the chancel. Part of the south wall of the chancel of St Faith's church, showing the 12th-century Norman priest's door and 14th-century Decorated Gothic windows The spire and south porch were added in 1625 and three windows in the north wall of the nave were probably added at the same time. The spire was destroyed by lightning in 1848 and rebuilt in 1852. The church contains a number of monuments, including one to William, 2nd Viscount Ashbrook (1767‚Äì1802) by John Flaxman. St Faith's is a Grade I listed building. The tower seems to have had a ring of four bells by the early part of the 20th century. The tenor bore the date 1586 but the founder was unidentified. Edward Neale of Burford cast the treble in 1653. Another bell bore no date but may have been cast in about 1599. Henry III Bagley, who had foundries at Chacombe and Witney, cast the final bell of the four in 1738. There is also a Sanctus bell that was cast in 1663. In the 20th century the ring was increased to six, but of the original bells only the Bagley and undated bells survive. Mears & Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the current tenor in 1920. In 1998 Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present treble and another bell. There is also another bell from the Whitechapel foundry, cast by Thomas II Mears in 1841. St Faith's is now part of the Benefice of Uffington, Shellingford, Woolstone and Baulking.

History Located in the valley of the River Seye, in the old province of Rouergue, the abbey was founded by the bishop of Rodez, Adhemar III. The buildings were heightened in the 17th centuries, but then fell into decline by the 18th century, when the cloister was demolished. At the time of the French Revolution, the monastery was closed and the buildings sold, to be converted into a farm. Part of the buildings were dismantled. In 1875, the buildings were first classed as a monument historique. The site was purchased in 1960 by M. Brache and Mme. Bonnefoi, who carried out important restoration work, aided by the Caisse des monuments historique et des sites (currently the Centre des monuments nationaux). In 1973, they gave the abbey, together with an important collection of modern art, to the French state.

She is also known by the title Maryam Makani, which was given to her by her son, Akbar. Family Hamida Banu Begum was born 1527 to Shaikh Ali Akbar Jami, a Persian Shia, who was a preceptor to Mughal prince Hindal Mirza, the youngest son of the first Mughal emperor, Babur. Ali Akbar Jami was also known as Mian Baba Dost, who belonged to the lineage of Ahmad Jami Zinda-fil. Hamida Banu's mother was Maah Afroz Begum, who married Ali Akbar Jami in Paat, Sindh. As suggested by her lineage, Hamida was a devout Muslim. Meeting with Humayun She met Humayun, as a fourteen- year-old girl and frequenting Mirza Hindal's household, at a banquet given by his mother, Dildar Begum (Babur's wife and Humayun's step-mother) in Alwar. Humayun was in exile after his exodus from Delhi, due to the armies of Sher Shah Suri, who had ambitions of restoring Afghan rule in Delhi.Mukherjee, p.119 When negotiations for Humayun's marriage with Hamida Banu Begum were going on, both Hamida and Hindal bitterly opposed the marriage proposal, possibly because they were involved with each other. It seems probable that Hamida was in love with Hindal, though there is only circumstantial evidence for it. In her book the Humayun-nama, Hindal's sister and Hamida's close friend, Gulbadan Begum, pointed out that Hamida was frequently seen in her brother's palace during those days, and even in the palace of their mother, Dildar Begum. Initially, Hamida refused to meet the emperor; eventually after forty days of pursuit and at the insistence of Dildar Begum, she agreed to marry him. She refers to her initial reluctance in the Humayunama,Mukherjee, p.120 Marriage Young Akbar recognizes his mother. An illustration from the Akbarnama. The marriage took place on a day chosen by the Emperor, an avid astrologer himself, employing his astrolabe, at mid-day on a Monday in September, 1541 (Jumada al-awwal 948 AH) at Patr (known as Paat, Dadu District of Sindh). Thus, she became his junior wife, after Bega Begum (later known as Haji Begum, after Hajj), who was his first wife and chief consort.Nasiruddin Humayun The Muntakhabu-‚Äôr≈´kh by Al-BadƒÅoni, Packard Humanities Institute. The marriage became \\"politically beneficial\\" to Humayun, as he got help from the rival Shia groups during times of war. Two years later, after a perilous journey through the desert, on 22 August 1542, she and Emperor Humayun reached at the Umerkot ruled by Rana Prasad, a Hindu Sodha Rajput, at a small desert town, where the Rana gave them asylum. Two months later, she gave birth future Emperor, Akbar, on the early morning of 15 October 1542 (fourth day of Rajab, 949 AH), he was given the name Humayun had heard in his dream at Lahore ‚Äì the Emperor Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar.Part 10:..the birth of Akbar Humayun nama by Gulbadan Begum.Conversion of Islamic and Christian dates (Dual) As per the date converter Akbar's birth date, as per Humayun nama, of 04 Rajab, 949 AH, corresponds to 14 October 1542.Amarkot Genealogy Queensland University... In coming years, she took on numerous tough journeys to follow her husband, who was still in flight. First, in the beginning of the following December, she and her new born went into camp at J≈´n, after traveling for ten or twelve days. Then in 1543, she made the perilous journey from Sindh, which had Qandahar for its goal, but in course of which Humayun had to take hasty flight from Shal-mastan, \\"through a desert and waterless waste\\". Leaving her little son behind, she accompanied her husband to Persia, here they visited the shrines of her ancestor, Ahmad-e Jami and Shiites shrine, of Ardabil in Iran, the place of origin of Safavid dynasty, which helped them immensely in the following years. In 1544, at a camp at Sabzawar, 93 miles south of Herat, she gave birth to a daughter. Thereafter, she returned from Persia with the army given to Humayun by Shah of Iran, Tahmasp I, and at Kandahar met Dildar Begum, and her son, Mirza Hindal. Thus, it was not until 15 November 1545 (Ramdan 10th, 952 AH) that she saw her son Akbar again, the scene of young Akbar recognizing his mother amongst a group of women has been keenly illustrated in Akbar's biography, Akbarnama. In 1548, she and Akbar accompanied Humayun to Kabul. Akbar's reign Akbar's mother travels by boat to Agra. An illustration from the Akbarnama. During the reign of Akbar, there are many instances where, imperial ladies interfered in matters of the court to ask pardon for a wrong doer. Though once Hamida Banu and her daughter-in-law, Ruqaiya Sultan Begum (Akbar's chief wife), did so, their pleas went to deaf ears as Akbar refused to forgive a Sunni Muslim from Lahore who had killed a Shia Muslim, purely out of religious fanaticism.Mukherjee, p.130 Meanwhile, Sher Shah Suri died in May 1545, and after that his son and successor, Islam Shah died too in 1554, disintegrating the Suri dynasty rule. In November 1554, when Humayun set out for India, she stayed back in Kabul. Though he took control of Delhi in 1555, he died within a year of his return, by falling down the steps of his library at Purana Qila, Delhi, in 1556 at the age of 47, leaving behind a thirteen-year-old heir, Akbar, who was to become one of greatest emperors of the empire. Hamida Banu joined Akbar from Kabul, only during his second year of reign, 1557 CE, and stayed with him thereafter, she even intervened into politics on various occasions, most notable during the ouster of Mughal minister, Bairam Khan, when Akbar came of age in 1560. Death and aftermath Cenotaph of Hamida Banu Begum along with that of Dara Shikoh and others, in a side chamber of Humayun's Tomb, Delhi. She was buried at Humayun's Tomb after her death on 29 August 1604 (19th Shahriyar, 1013 AH) in Agra, just a year before the death of her son Akbar and almost half a century after death of her husband, Humayun. Throughout her years, she was held in high regard by her son Akbar, as English traveler Thomas Coryat recorded, Akbar carrying her palanquin himself across the river, during one of her journeys from Lahore to Agra. Later when Prince Salim, future emperor Jahangir, revolted against his father Akbar, she took upon the case of her grandson, and a reconciliation ensued thereafter, even though Salim had plotted and got Akbar's favorite minister Abu'l-Fazl killed. Akbar shaved his head and chin only on two occasions, one at the death of foster-mother Jiji Anga and another at the death of his mother.Genealogy of Hamida BegumHamida Banu Faces of the feminine in ancient, medieval, and modern India, by Mandakranta Bose.

Seawings Cessna Caravan 208 Amphibian Seaplane  History of Seaplanes in Dubai[edit]  Seaplanes have always celebrated the pinnacle of luxury travel. Back in the 1930s, the flying boats resembled a gentleman's club in the sky. Passengers would be accommodated in a club type cabin and would always be dressed for the occasion. Rising early each morning they would join their flying boat for each sector of their long journey. Each night would be spent in an exotic location from Europe, to Egypt to Dubai Creek and thence to India and Australia. Eighty years after the first flying boat service landed on Dubai Creek, Seawings offers an opportunity to experience travel by seaplane and explore less visited corners of the UAE. Aviation began in Dubai in 1937, when the first Imperial Airways flying boat, operating a weekly service between the UK and Pakistan, landed on the Dubai Creek. From 1940 to 1950, the Horseshoe Route from Durban to Sydney via the Persian Gulf was established. By the end of 1944, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) was operating 8 flying boats a week. January 1947 saw the last of the ‚ÄòC‚Äô class, Short Empire flying boats operating the Horseshoe route through Khartoum, Luxor, Cairo, Kallia (Dead Sea), Habbaniya (Iraq), Basra, Bahrain, Dubai and Jiwani to Karachi.

It is located about 7 kilometres south-west of Quairading, in the Shire of Quairading. At the 2006 census, Dangin had a population of 283. Dangin is named after the nearby Dangin Spring, which is in turn thought to be an Australian Aboriginal place name meaning \\"place where the Djanja grows\\", \\"Djanja\\" being a species of Hakea that grows in the vicinity. The name is recorded for 1863 as the name of the farm of Edward Read Parker, son of the first settler in the region. Around 1900, Edward's son Jonah, into whose hands the land had passed, began subdividing the property, forming a townsite of sorts, albeit on private land. In 1902 the town was formally gazetted, but even then it was surrounded by Parker land, and the only access to the town was through a gate. Six years later, Quairading had been established, gazetted, and connected by rail, and thereafter Quairading rapidly took over from Dangin as the main regional centre.http://www.smh.com.au/news/western- australia/quairading/2005/02/17/1108500208669.html Dangin was the original town in the area, but the owner of the townsite did not allow alcohol to be sold and had a Temperance hotel. When the rail went through to the next town (Quairading) a pub was built. Gradually the town moved to the new site, especially after water was sourced from the Dangin supply at Taopin Weir.https://www.quairading.wa.gov.au/play.aspx Quairading has grown into a moderate wheatbelt centre while Dangin these days, has only a handful of houses left.  Dangin Gate case  During the 1910s, Parker made public some of their lands from their farm into an allocation of a schoolhouse, but in 1912 a teacher wrote to the education department complaining that Parker was threatening to keep locked a gate in a fence that ran right through the grounds of the township, because people using that gate were leaving it open, allowing Parker's crops to be at risk. However this led to difficulty in accessing the township itself. This led to a petition from the townspeople in asking the government to take over the township. However after a public meeting a couple of weeks later the ratepayers repudiated this move. Parker then proposed to the board to fence certain roads into the town and he would fence off the town-site and remove the gate. This was rejected on the grounds of cost. In October 1912 the board removed the gate which exposed Parker's land to cattle. Parker responded by promising that if the gate were replaced it could be left open during the day, and he himself would pay for it to be closed at night. This was refused. In 1913 there was a Supreme Court decision affecting the Greenhills Road Board where they had removed a gate across the South Caroling Road. There was a dispute from Jonah, who owned the gate. But the court ruled against him, allowing the gate to be removed. With this precedent, in May 1914 the annual ratepayers meeting in Dangin announced that they would submit the dispute to the Federal High Court. When asked if the board first consult the ratepayers before submitting the case the Chairman declined \\"on the grounds that it did not concern them, this sapient remark aroused a storm of hilarious derision from the meeting\\". When the dispute was submitted to the court, it found that the Board was wrong in removing the gate, and in fact did not make a \\"landmark\\" decision and the Board had to pay ¬£102.3s to the Parkers. All the members of the board responsible were removed on the exception of the Chairman after this scuffle. In 1920 when the Repatriation Department was looking for large holdings to create blocks for returned soldiers, the park estate was considered ideal when the property was divided into 19 Lots. It went before a board which included Thomas Richard. Charles Kirkwood, the 22 successful applicants were paid nine Shillings a day by the industrial assistance board to get them started that Lease was for 25 years. One reason why the park estate was particularly attractive to the reparation apartment was the reliable water supply that been established. Thanks were to Parker's enterprising schemes the Toapin Weir that was able to safeguard the growth of a thriving community and growing pastoral industry a constant water supply was the necessity and the Parkers had the means the resources and the determination to achieve this end.Eaton, F.

A platform that allows users, mostly students and educators to combine text, images, video, and audio to create an interactive, Web-based poster called glogs on a virtual canvas. Glogster facilitates the conveyance of social information in many different fields such as art, music, photography. Users also have access to a library of engaging educational content posters created by other students and educators worldwide. Glogster enables interactive, collaborative education and digital literacy. History Glogster a. s., Inc, was founded in 2007 by Martin Santorcl, Patrik Prepsl, Roman Smola, Stanislav ≈†r√°mek and Tom√°≈° Plojhar, with offices in Prague and Boston. They launched the first platform, Glogster.com also in 2007. This platform was initially promoted as a visual network, allowing users to express themselves via ‚Äúgraphic blogs‚Äù or ‚Äúglogs‚Äù. However, in response to needs of educators incorporating Glogster into lessons and assignments, Glogster EDU (or edu.glogster.com) was set up alongside Glogster.com in 2009, offering a more secure and educational specific platform. Glogster EDU, has an annual subscription cost but gives educators a dashboard to provide instructions, templates and a private area for their class (es). The regular Glogster.com, the social network platform, was closed for new registrations and account access ceased in Feb 2015. After this the company focused solely on the Glogster EDU platform. There is, however, a personal type license available for single users. The platform has grown into a worldwide community in over 200 countries, with over 1.9 million teacher accounts with over 17 million student accounts who have created more than 25 million educational glogs, out of 45 million total glogs on the service. Features=Online editor= Glogster's online editor allows users to arrange images, graphics, audio, video, and texts on a single page to create multimedia posters. It also provides access to 10,000 original graphic elements such as backgrounds, text boxes, frames and more. Media can be imported from around the web via URL or uploaded from users‚Äô own files. =Content library= The Glogpedia library is a constantly-growing collection of over 40, 000 glogs, selected based on accuracy and presentation, and categorized into 80 subjects under 9 disciplines according to the K-12 curriculum. Glogster users can nominate glogs to be considered for inclusion in the library by clicking a button at the top of any public glog. Glogpedia content is intended for use in place of, or alongside, conventional curriculum texts, for example as interactive research material or to engage learners with a new topic. Users can also save editable copies of glogs to their own dashboards, and adapt them to their own needs. Mobile apps=iOS= Glogster released an iOS application for iPad in September 2014, bringing an updated version of the editor and the content library to iPad. The Glog interface incorporates a built-in browser known as the Web Picker, allowing users to search for media directly from the app, and drag it onto their glog canvas. The app is also synced with the iPad's built- in camera and mic, allowing users to record video, audio and photos directly onto their glogs. The iPad application expands learning beyond the traditional classroom, allowing users to create glogs based on events as they happen, and giving them freedom to learn and create in their own time. =Android= In early 2015, Glogster released a Glogpedia library browser application for Android, with the announcement that full editing functionality for Android would be made available within the year. In October 2015 Glogster released an Android app for tablet devices with full editing functionality.  Glogster in the classroom  Glogster EDU is used as a learning and teaching tool to foster higher order thinking skills. Creating posters or glogs allows learners to engage closely with a subject, exercising critical thinking and research skills in selecting appropriate media and creative skills in structuring and arranging the finished piece. Glogster is being used in place of traditional poster assignments and demonstrates how versatile such a poster-creation tool can be when partnered with solid teaching pedagogy and teacher creativity. The use of Glogster, motives and excites students to do their work. A study showed that the usage of the Glogster EDU educational platform develops necessary competences, such as, communication skills, creativity and intellectual curiosity, critical and systematized thinking, information and media skills, collaborative and interpersonal skills, problem identification, formulation, and solving and social responsibility.  Training and certification  In 2015, Glogster launched the GATE (Global Ambassadors for Technology in Education) program, focused on offering Glogster educators training materials and certifications, as well as recruiting a small group of representatives to assist in promoting Glogster online and in their local areas.  Contests, collaboration and partnerships  In 2016, 2017 & 2018 Glogster was the tool used for the NASA Spinoff Promotion And Research Challenge - OPSPARC. The aim of the challenge was for students to create NASA inspired spinoff ideas and show them by creating a \\"Glog,\\"an online multimedia poster via Glogster. There were three levels of the competition- the Elementary School Category for students grades 3-6, the Middle School Category for students grades 7-8 and the High School Category for students grades 9-12. Students were instructed to research spinoffs found in their homes or schools, and just like an engineer, use an engineering design process to take an everyday object and use it in new ways that will solve a problem learning invaluable STEM inspired skills. Students will show off their work by using videos, drawings, pictures and text and submitting them in the form of a glog.

He also played a key role in Sainsbury‚Äôs expansion during the 1920s and 1930s, visiting potential new store sites with his family at weekends and conducting his own market research. He expanded it into a chain of 250 grocery outlets throughout the south of England, East Anglia and the Midlands. He died in office in 1956.

Phenylketonuria (PKU) can result in severe hyperphenylalaninemia. Phenylalanine concentrations ([phe]) are routinely screened in newborns by the neonatal heel prick (Guthrie test), which takes a few drops of blood from the heel of the infant. Standard [phe] concentrations in unaffected persons are about 60¬µM: [phe] concentrations in persons with untreated phenylketonuria may be many times that (600¬µM to 2400¬µM), which indicate that the child is at risk for severe intellectual disability. Phenylketonuria is classed as an autosomal recessive condition: in heterozygous form, [phe] shows a moderate elevation, perhaps two-fold over that of unaffected homozygotes, which is classified as hyperphenylalaninemia (hyper- + phenylalanine + -emia = high [phe] in blood). Symptoms and signs The coloration of the skin, hair, and eyes is different in children with PKU. This is caused by low levels of tyrosine, whose metabolic pathway is blocked by deficiency of PAH. Another skin alteration that might occur is the presence of irritation or dermatitis. The child's behaviour may be influenced as well due to augmented levels of phenethylamine which in turn affects levels of other amines in the brain. Psychomotor function may be affected and observed to worsen progressively. Cause People with the genotype for PKU are unaffected in utero, because maternal circulation prevents buildup of [phe]. After birth, PKU in newborns is treated by a special diet with highly restricted phenylalanine content. Persons with genetic predisposition to PKU have normal mental development on this diet. Previously, it was thought safe to withdraw from the diet in the late teens or early twenties, after the central nervous system was fully developed; recent studies suggest some degree of relapse, and a continued phenylalanine- restricted diet is now recommended. PKU or hyperphenylalaninemia may also occur in persons without the PKU genotype. If the mother has the PKU genotype but has been treated so as to be asymptomatic, high levels of [phe] in the maternal blood circulation may affect the non-PKU fetus during gestation. Mothers successfully treated for PKU are advised to return to the [phe]-restricted diet during pregnancy. A small subset of patients with hyperphenylalaninemia shows an appropriate reduction in plasma phenylalanine levels with dietary restriction of this amino acid; however, these patients still develop progressive neurologic symptoms and seizures and usually die within the first 2 years of life (\\"malignant\\" hyperphenylalaninemia). These infants exhibit normal phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzymatic activity but have a deficiency in dihydropteridine reductase (DHPR), an enzyme required for the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (THB or BH4), a cofactor of PAH. Less frequently, DHPR activity is normal but a defect in the biosynthesis of THB exists. In either case, dietary therapy corrects the hyperphenylalaninemia. However, THB is also a cofactor for two other hydroxylation reactions required in the syntheses of neurotransmitters in the brain: the hydroxylation of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan and of tyrosine to L-dopa. It has been suggested that the resulting deficit in the CNS neurotransmitter activity is, at least in part, responsible for the neurologic manifestations and eventual death of these patients.\\"Basic Medical Biochemistry\\", Fourth edition Hyperphenylalaninemia most is commonly diagnosed by newborn screening and must be distinguished from classic PKU by confirmatory testing at an experienced center. Some cases in adult women have been detected using maternal screening programs or following birth of children with birth defects. Elevated phenylalanine levels are associated with neuropsychological effects. Treatment Maintain plasma phenylalanine values in therapeutic range of 120 to 360 mM using a diet that restricts phenylalanine but otherwise nutritionally complete. Treatment for life is recommended to reduce the risk of long term neuropsychiatric problems and reduce the risk of maternal PKU syndrome. Outcome With treatment the outcome is excellent. Most infants with classic PKU who are treated within the first 10 days of life achieve normal intelligence. However learning problems are more frequent than in unaffected peers.

The site is adjacent to the concurrent U.S. Routes 14/16/20, on the left bank of the North Fork of the Shoshone River at an altitude of in Shoshone National Forest. At its mouth, the cave is approximately wide, and it extends approximately into a volcanic cliff above the North Fork. It lies along the left bank of the river, next to the mouth of a small stream and opposite from the mouth of Blackwater Creek. The largest known cave along the North Fork, it is believed to have been carved by the river's flow; the reason for its diversion away from the alcove is unknown. Mummy Cave was occupied between 7280 BC and AD 1580. Discovered by Cody resident Gene Smith in 1957,Sniffin, Bill. \\"Mummies in Wyoming?\\". Weston County Gazette, 2015-06-18, 12. it was first studied in 1962 and excavated by the Buffalo Bill Historical Center. The site includes unusual amounts of perishable materials such as hide, feathers and wood, as well as the buried and mummified remains of an inhabitant, named by researchers \\"Mummy Joe,\\" and dated to about AD 800. The cave is notable for the depth of its cultural deposits, extending over in depth, and in particular for the continuity of those deposits. The deposits have been classified into 38 occupation levels that represent at least seasonal use of the site on an annual basis, extending from the Paleoindian period to the late Prehistoric period. Geology A closer view of the cave Although it is referred to as a \\"cave\\", Mummy Cave is actually a broad, shallow alcove in a vertical cliff. It owes its depth to its overall size and the stability of the parent rock. The alcove's roof is about above the river, with the rock floor of the alcove at about above the river. By the time it was discovered, the alcove had been almost entirely filled with alluvium. The cliff is composed of Tertiary period volcanic ash mixed with larger rock fragments of volcanic origin. A similar alcove is being cut by the Shoshone at the mouth of Clocktower Creek. The cave fill has accumulated for at least 10,000 years and appears to have originated from nearby debris fans formed where weathered material has flowed down channels in neighboring cliffs. Apart from the depth and consistent nature of the alluvium, Mummy Cave is also characterized by extreme dryness. The pointed shape of the cliff above prevents rain and meltwater from percolating through the rock to the cave, and there are no vertical joints in the rock above. Archeological investigation The investigation of Mummy Cave was led by Robert Edgar from 1963 to 1965. The alcove was marked out into a grid, with a permanent reference mark for elevation marked on the wall. Initial investigation focused on establishing stratigraphy. Once the layers of alluvium in the cave floor were established, the excavation proceeded layer by layer. The excavations terraced the cave floor into levels, following the established reference grid. Digging was done with hand trowels in the artifact-bearing layers while layers devoid of artifacts were excavated with shovels. Spoils were disposed of down the embankment. The site had previously been disturbed by relic hunters, who had dug a deep pit in what turned out to be the most productive zone of the excavation. The relic hunters appear to have stopped when they encountered a rock cairn that covered what proved to be a human burial site. By the end of 1963 a portion of the site had been excavated to a depth of and shored with timbers, while the upper three cultural zones (layers 36‚Äì38) were removed across the site. During the 1964 season layers 29‚Äì35 were removed and some zones were excavated much more deeply. In 1965 layers 24‚Äì28 were removed from the central area of the alcove. By this time it was clear that excavation would proceed for the full depth of the site, and that the disposal of a considerable quantity of excavated debris would need to be addressed. A bulldozer was brought in to remove sections of fill beyond the drip line of the shelter. The 1966 season was directed by Wilfred M. Husted. Results of the Mummy Cave investigations were published in Science in 1968. Results The excavation of Mummy Cave yielded a nearly continuous succession of artifacts, which span a period of over 9000 years. The artifacts were disposed in a manner that permitted dating in both relative terms through stratigraphy, as well as through radiocarbon dating to establish an absolute scale. This continuum has proved to be invaluable in relating and dating other excavations in the Rocky Mountain region. In particular, the stone projectile points found at Mummy Cave have been used to set the standard for classifying stone arrowheads and spear heads in the region. The point typology has been extrapolated to define cultural and commercial relationships between peoples throughout the American West. Stratigraphy and carbon dating indicate that Mummy Cave was first occupied near the end of the Pinedale glaciation. Later occupancy spanned the Altithermal, followed by a cooler climate from about 1000 BC. The earliest layers at Mummy Cave yielded a few prismatic stone blades dating to about 7300 BC. Several layers contained no artifacts and were defined by soot layers. By layer 6 the first parallel- oblique points appeared. By Layer 8, roughly corresponding to 6500 BC, the cultural evidence became continuous. Layers 8, 9, 10 and 12 produced lanceolate or leaf-shaped projectile points which have been interpreted as corresponding to Angostura-style points. This implies that the inhabitants of Mummy Cave during this era were big-game hunters from the Great Plains who adapted to the mountain environment. In layer 16, radiocarbon dated to 5630 BC, a new type of point appeared. These Blackwater side-notched points implied the arrival of a group from eastern Nebraska or western Iowa, replacing the previous group which may have moved to the north. The presence of such points suggests a connection with the Simonsen Site in northeastern Iowa, which has been dated to the Early Archaic period. This transition coincided with the climatic shift to the Altithermal. Side-notched points recovered from layers 21, 24 and 28 imply a return of the previous inhabitants; the easterners had moved on to the central Columbian Plateau. Layer 30 was dated to 2470¬±150 BC. Layer 32 was dated to 870¬±135 BC. It is hypothesized that layers 32‚Äì38 represent the presence of people of the Shoshonean culture, with increasingly definitive Shoshonean artifacts present from layer 36 onward, including cordage and basketwork. Layer 38 yielded gray flat-bottomed pottery of Shoshonean manufacture. Layer 36 is notable as the source of the \\"mummy.\\" The desiccated body of an adult male covered by a sheepskin garment with fur and feather ornament was recovered from this layer and dated to about AD 770 by radiocarbon dating. Several thousand animal bones were discovered in Mummy Cave. While the large majority of the bones could not be identified, researchers at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) were able to determine the biological origins of over two thousand bones. As at many other archeological sites in the region, significant numbers of Bighorn Sheep (Ovis canadensis) and deer from the genus Odocoileus were identified. Of particular interest to biologists was the much larger number of sheep than deer: eighty- eight sheep and fifteen deer were identified. Such a prevalence of sheep over deer is highly unusual for archeological sites in the region, because deer are equally or more plentiful in areas such as the one in which Mummy Cave is located. This anomaly has led researchers at UTEP to propose that the site was used as a home base for hunters to operate at higher altitudes.McCracken, Harold, et al. \\"The Mummy Cave Project in Northwestern Wyoming, Buffalo Bill Historical Center, 1978. Accessed 2009-07-31. The wide range of artifacts discovered at the site has caused Mummy Cave to be seen as a highly significant site for the study of Rocky Mountain archeology. The cave's significance was recognized by the National Park Service with its placement on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

The community has an estimated population of 100. Geography Old Glory is situated immediately south of the junction of U.S. Highway 380 and FM 1835 in eastern Stonewall County, between the Double Mountain Fork and the Salt Fork Brazos River. Old Glory lies nine miles east of Aspermont and sixty- two miles northwest of Abilene. History Development of the area began in the late 1880s with a few ranches and scattered farms. Around 1900, a number of German families from southeast Texas moved to the vicinity and settled along the Double Mountain Fork Brazos River. In 1903, G.R. Spielhagen laid out a town site two miles southeast of the present-day location and named it Brandenburg. Only a school house and a general store were constructed there. The Stamford and Northwestern Railway Company was chartered to build a railroad from Stamford to Spur in 1909. The Swenson Land and Cattle Company provided a town site two miles northwest of the Brandenburg settlement. The new town became known as New Brandenburg, with the originally referred to as Old Brandenburg, which soon died out. New Brandenburg, or simply Brandenburg, continued to grow. A mercantile store, a gin, post office, and a one room school house served the community. The outbreak of World War I had an adverse impact on New Brandenburg. The rise in anti-German sentiment in the United States and Texas caused residents to petition the U.S. Postal Service to change the community's name from New Brandenburg to Old Glory. They wanted to demonstrate their patriotism and pride in their adopted country. The name change became official on August 9, 1918. By 1929, Old Glory had an estimated population of 275. A school building erected in 1930 following the consolidation of five local schools had an enrollment of nearly 300 students by the late 1930s. The Great Depression caused a brief decline in Old Glory's population, but had rebounded to around 250 by the late 1940s. That number had fallen to 175 in the late 1940s. A severe drought in the 1950s forced many people out of work. The development of oil resources in Stonewall County during the late 1950s and early 1960s caused a brief economic Boom in Old Glory. In 1965, there were approximately 250 people living in the community. Old Glory's population fell to 125 in the 1970s and remained at that level through the 1990s. The present-day number of Old Glory residents stands at around 100. Although Old Glory is unincorporated, it does have a post office with the zip code of 79540. Public education Public education in the community of Old Glory is provided by the Aspermont Independent School District. The district's campuses are located in the town of Aspermont. The Old Glory Independent School District once served the community, but rapidly declining enrollment caused the district and its schools to close. On July 1, 1985, the areas once served by Old Glory ISD were annexed into the Aspermont Independent School District.

Borsdane Wood was designated a Local Nature Reserve in 1986. The wood consists of approximately 34 hectares (85 acres) of mixed broadleaf trees including species such as oak, ash, birch, cherry, hazel, hawthorn, blackthorn and dog rose, as well as areas of open ground. With trees many hundreds of years old the wood has remained relatively unchanged for centuries and is home to a wide variety of wildlife. The wood follows the course of the Borsdane Brook which is the boundary between Hindley and Westhoughton and the Metropolitan Boroughs of Wigan and Bolton. The brook flows through Wigan, Pennington Flash and into the Glaze Brook. From Hindley, Greater Manchester there are several entrances to the wood, one of which can be accessed from Hindley centre through Raynor Park or through the cemetery. A tunnel under the railway leads into woodland little changed in centuries. A path leads to Aspull, Greater Manchester where the access is located near the Gerrard Arms Public House.

Life and career He was born in Meerane, Saxony, Germany, and began his career with the Meerane 07 club in 1922. In 1927 he was signed by English coach Jimmy Hogan for Dresdner SC, becoming known to fans as \\"K√∂nig\\" (\\"King\\") Richard. Why ‚ÄúKing Richard‚Äù missed the FIFA World Cup He was known for his thunderous shots with either foot. He started his international career in 1927, scoring a hat-trick against Switzerland. At the 1928 Olympic Games in Amsterdam he was sent off in a match against Uruguay, and was suspended from internationals for a year. In 1930, Hofmann lost his right ear in a car accident. This impaired his balance and had a serious impact on his career, later playing with protection over his ear. However, on 10 May 1930, playing for the German national team against England in Berlin, he scored a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì3 draw. He also scored hat- tricks for the national team against Sweden (1929), Denmark (1931) and Finland (1932).

The extra money allowed the club to sign several ex-professional players, including Paul Arnison, Adam Boyd and Graeme Lee. Former Newcastle United assistant manager Mick Wadsworth was appointed manager in late April 2013, with Wadsworth revealing that he had turned down an assistant manager role at a League One side to take up the challenge at Celtic Nation. Wadsworth resigned after 10 matches in charge, and was succeeded as manager by Willie McStay. After financial support for the club was withdrawn, Wille McStay and the majority of the playing staff left the club. At one point in the summer of 2014 the club had only four registered players. Former Newcastle United, Barrow and Carlisle United midfielder Mark Boyd took on the role of player/manager of Celtic Nation appointing Nation forward, Jonny Allan, as assistant. On 25 April 2015, Nation confirmed that they had resigned from the Northern League and would fold due to financial problems and losing the lease of Gillford Park to Northern Football Alliance Premier Division neighbours Carlisle City.http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/latest-news/step-five-and- below/12378/cash-strapped-celtic-nation-to-fold-after-ten-years/ Three days later Celtic Nation played their last ever match against North Shields, which ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat.

This case has received extensive publicity and touches on issues such as consumer protection, limits of libel, free speech, and strategic lawsuits against public participation. The lawsuit was dismissed after a judge determined that the actions did not meet the definition of libel. Horizon contended that Bonnen defamed Horizon by posting a \\"tweet\\", or Twitter message, on May 12, 2009, to her friends that said, \\"You should just come anyway. Who said sleeping in a moldy apartment was bad for you?

Jeffrey Michael, whose family runs Horizon, said the suit was warranted and that Horizon is \\"a sue first, ask questions later kind of an organization.\\" The lawsuit prompted widespread comment from journalists, bloggers, and legal experts. Sam Bayard, assistant director of Harvard's Citizen Media Law Project called the suit \\"foolhardy\\", adding \\"They chose to file a lawsuit, instead drawing more attention to it,\\" rather than handling the matter as a consumer complaint. Michael later stated that Bonnen's Twitter post emerged from an earlier lawsuit by Bonnen that Horizon violated the Chicago Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance, although Michael denied his suit was a strategic lawsuit against public participation. The exact cause of Bonnen's lawsuit was not discussed by Michael, but he acknowledged a leaky roof at the apartment complex caused by a contractor in March 2009. Court documents revealed that Bonnen originally sued Horizon for failing to pay interest on security deposits and failing to provide tenants with required porch safety disclosures. Bonnen was represented by the Balough Law Offices, LLC, the Center for Information Technology and Privacy Law at John Marshall Law School and The Law Offices of Jeffrey S. Sobek, P.C.

Trophy history The Boston College Gridiron Club commissioned the trophy to honor the relationship between Clemson and Boston College that began , in early 1940, and to recognize the support of Tiger fans in welcoming Boston College to the ACC, which BC joined in 2005. The trophy features two leather helmet replicas of those used by O‚ÄôRourke of Boston College and McFadden of Clemson, when they competed against each other in the 1940 Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas. In addition to the trophy presentation, the Boston College Gridiron Club presents a replica leather helmet to the MVP of the winning school. The helmet will reflect the colors of the winning team. Namesakes Charlie O‚ÄôRourke led Boston College from the quarterback position to a record in his three years (1938‚Äì40). One of those three losses was to McFadden and Clemson in the 1940 Cotton Bowl. O'Rourke went on to play quarterback and defensive back for the Chicago Bears, Los Angeles Dons, and Baltimore Colts. After two years as an NFL coach, he coached at Massachusetts (1952‚Äì59). O‚ÄôRourke later served as commissioner of the Pop Warner League, a national organization of junior football teams. His jersey was retired at Boston College and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1972. Banks McFadden led the Tigers to a 9‚Äì1 record in 1939 as the starting quarterback. He was an All-American in football and basketball at Clemson. The 1939 football team finished 12th in the final AP poll (early December), for Clemson‚Äôs first top 20 season on record, and the win over Boston College in the Cotton Bowl was Clemson‚Äôs first bowl appearance. In the spring of 1939, he led Clemson to the Southern Conference Basketball championship. McFadden was Clemson‚Äôs first inductee into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1959. He was the fourth overall pick of the 1940 NFL Draft by the Brooklyn Dodgers. After one year in the NFL and a stint in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he returned to Clemson and held coaching positions in football, basketball, and track. McFadden became the first coach in college basketball history to improve his conference wins in five consecutive seasons.

He is a Visiting Professor at Kings College London's Policy Institute. He was formerly Chair of the Australian Centre for Social Innovation, the Australian Government's Innovation Australia and Kaggle. Lindsay Tanner has described him as \\"Australia's foremost public intellectual\\". Education Gruen graduated from the University of Melbourne Law School and has a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours in History from the Australian National University. He has a PhD from the Australian National University. Career Gruen worked as adviser to Senator and Federal Industry Minister John Button from the early 1980s and was regarded as the architect of the Button car plan, which freed up automotive trade, eliminated quotas, reduced tariffs and assisted exports during the transition. From 1990 to 1993 he was economic adviser to Treasurer John Dawkins. He was appointed to the Productivity Commission on which he served until the late 1990s when he joined the Business Council of Australia directing its New Directions project. In 2000 he founded economic consultancy Lateral Economics and a discount finance broker that rebates commission to borrowers Peach Home Loans. In this period he has advised Federal and State Governments both as a consultant and when appointed as member or chair of various official committees. He is a member of the Council of the National Library of Australia. In 2011 he was appointed to the board of Innovation Australia and was subsequently appointed as its chair. He also chaired the Open Knowledge Foundation (Australia) Gruen has become prominent in public economic discussion. He had a regular economic column for the Courier Mail and later wrote regularly for the Australian Financial Review. He contributes regularly to the popular blog Club Troppo. He built the Herald/Age Lateral Economics (HALE) Index of Wellbeing which augments official national income measures to take account of the implications of changes in inequality, human capital, natural capital, and major health issues such as life expectancy, mental illness and obesity. He has mounted the public case for various reforms including * refashioning government fiscal institutions in the image of monetary policy to inject greater independence and flexibility into government capital expenditure and fiscal policy as a macro-economic instrument. * allowing people to access their superannuation savings (pension plan) to help raise a house deposit. * improving information flows in a range of markets such as labour markets (on relative safety and job quality) and markets for professional services (on service quality and likely outcomes). * building digital public private partnerships to enable services such as 23andMe to be provided as free public goods rather than private goods by subscription and for the resulting data to be maximally open (subject to opting in and privacy constraints). * giving citizens and business presumptive access to government provided services on competitive neutrality grounds. This would apply to the wealth management governments provide for their public servants and citizens would be able to bank with the central bank to level the playing field between them and commercial banks and to capture substantial seigniorage revenue for government. This policy was taken to the 2019 election by the Greens. * building evidence-based policy and programs with an Evaluator General providing independent evaluation of government programs. He was a member of the Federal Government's Review of the Australian Innovation System in 2008 and chaired the Government 2.0 Taskforce for the Australian Government which was widely praised internationally.https://web.archive.org/web/20180315112039/http://gov2.net.au/ The Government subsequently accepted all of the major recommendations of the Taskforce. Gruen was also the first investor in Kaggle (a Melbourne-based data analytics company founded in 2010) serving as its first chairman. He was an early investor in HealthKit and its first chairman and has invested in a range of other Australian and international start-ups. Position In 2014 Gruen suggested a radical bank reform that would solve a range of problems. According to Gruen ordinary people should be able to use central banks' services as commercial banks can. For big commercial banks get high margins or fees but don't add much value to those services. Due to the internet the Bank of England for instance could easily extend its services to everyone in the UK. For one thing it should offer deposit and savings account to all.http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/central_banking_for_all.pdf Gruen, Central banking for all Family Gruen is the son of prominent Australian economist Fred Gruen and the brother of former Federal Treasury official and current Australian Statistician David Gruen.

Along with Koulutla Chena Kesava Temple there are additional Shiva temples in this shrine. * Mallikarjuna Swamy, Bramarambika and Vijaya Vinayaka Temple * Lord Dakshinamurthy Temple * Lord Viswanatha Temple  History King Parikshith (the grandson, of Arjuna) ruled over Hastinapura after Pandavas retired to Kailasa. One day, Parikshith was thirsty while on a hunting trip to the forest. He found a saint in deep meditation. He asked for water and the Rishi (saint) did not reply. Parikshith got frustrated and played a prank by putting a dead snake around the neck of the Rishi. He was cursed by the Rishi that he would die of a snake bite within a week; he died consequently at the hands of the Naga prince Takshaka.Koulutla Chenna Kesava Temple front view When Janamejaya (the son of Parikshith) became the King, he wanted to avenge the death of his father and performed Sarpa Yaga (serpent penance). Things then took a fateful turn. Astika, who was born of a man and a Naga woman, came to the snake sacrifice and, seeing what was happening, explained to Janamejaya that Takshaka was safe under Indra's protection. Janamejaya was extremely pleased to have gotten this valuable information and granted Astika a wish. Astika asked to stop the snake sacrifice, instead of asking for gold or silver. Then Saint Vasista asked Janamejaya to perform consecration (Prathista) of Vishnava temples to redeem the sins of killing innocent snakes during Sarpa Yaga. Consequently, a Chennakesava idol was consecrated in Koundinya Asrama to perform regular pujas. After many years, the idol was covered by an anthill (putta). In the 11th century A.D., Golla Koulutla observed that his cow was letting her milk flow to the anthill (putta). That night, Lord Chennakesava (Vishnu) appeared in his dream and told him to remove the anthill and re-consecrate his idol. Koulutla dutifully followed the instructions and from then on the deity was known as Koulutla Chennakesava Swamy.

Not correcting for these effects gives rise to systematic errors, i.e. effects which act in a predictable manner and therefore can be corrected by mathematical methods.  Correction due to slope  \\\\theta is the angle between the slope line and the horizontal line, s is the slope distance measured between two points on the slope line, h is the height of the slope. C_v =2L*sin^2 + \\\\frac {A}{2} Where L= Inclined length measured A= Inclined angle When distances are measured along the slope, the equivalent horizontal distance may be determined by applying a slope correction. The vertical slope angle of the length measured must be measured. (Refer to the figure on the other side) Thus, :*For gentle slopes, m<20\\\\% ::C_h = \\\\frac {h^2}{2s} :*For steep slopes, 20\\\\%\\\\le m \\\\le 30\\\\% ::C_h = \\\\frac {h^2}{2s} + \\\\frac {h^4}{8s^3} :*For very steep slopes, m>30\\\\% ::C_h = s(1-\\\\cos \\\\theta), ::Or, more simply, d = s * \\\\cos \\\\theta Where: :C_h is the correction of measured slope distance due to slope; :\\\\theta is the angle between the measured slope line and horizontal line; :s is the measured slope distance. :d is the horizontal distance. The correction C_h is subtracted from s to obtain the equivalent horizontal distance on the slope line: :d = s - C_h  Correction due to temperature  When measuring or laying out distances, the standard temperature of the tape and the temperature of the tape at time of measurement are usually different. A difference in temperature will cause the tape to lengthen or shorten, so the measurement taken will not be exactly correct. A correction can be applied to the measured length to obtain the correct length. The correction of the tape length due to change in temperature is given by: :C_t = C \\\\cdot L (T_m - T_s) Where: :C_t is the correction to be applied to the tape due to temperature; :C is the coefficient of thermal expansion of the metal that forms the tape; :L is the length of the tape or length of the line measured. :T_m is the observed temperature of the tape at the time of measurement; :T_s is the standard temperature, when the tape is at the correct length, often 20 ¬∞C; The correction C_t is added to L to obtain the corrected distance: :d = L + C_t For common tape measurements, the tape used is a steel tape with coefficient of thermal expansion C equal to 0.000,011,6 units per unit length per degree Celsius change. This means that the tape changes length by 1.16 mm per 10 m tape per 10 ¬∞C change from the standard temperature of the tape. For a 30 meter long tape with standard temperature of 20 ¬∞C used at 40 ¬∞C, the change in length is 7 mm over the length of the tape.  Correction due to sag  A tape not supported along its length will sag and form a catenary between end supports. The correction due to sag must be calculated separately for each unsupported stretch separately and is given by: :C_s = \\\\frac {{\\\\omega}^2 L^3}{24P^2} Where: :C_s is the correction applied to the tape due to sag; meters; :\\\\omega is the weight of the tape per unit length; newtons per meter; :L is the length between the two ends of the catenary; meters; :P is the tension or pull applied to the tape; newtons. A tape held in catenary will record a value larger than the correct measurement. Thus, the correction C_s is subtracted from L to obtain the corrected distance: :d = L - C_s Note that the weight of the tape per unit length is equal to the weight of the tape divided by the length of the tape: :\\\\omega = \\\\frac {W}{L} so: W = \\\\omega L Therefore, we can rewrite the formula for correction due to sag as: :C_s = \\\\frac {W^2 L}{24 P^2} =Derivation (sag)= The general formula for a catenary formed by a tape supported only at its ends is :y = \\\\frac{P}{\\\\omega g} \\\\cosh \\\\left(\\\\frac{x \\\\omega g}{P}\\\\right). Here, g is the gravitational acceleration. The arc length between two support points at x=-k/2 and x=+k/2 is found by usual methods via integration: :L = \\\\int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(dy/dx\\\\right)^2} \\\\, dx For convenience set a=\\\\frac{P}{\\\\omega g}. The integrand is simplified as follows using hyperbolic function identities: :\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(dy/dx\\\\right)^2} = \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\left(a \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right)^2} = \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\sinh^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)} = \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right) The tape length L is then found by integrating: :L = \\\\int_{-k/2}^{+k/2} \\\\cosh\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right) dx = \\\\left[a \\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{a}\\\\right)\\\\right]_{x=-k/2}^{x=+k/2} = \\\\left(2a\\\\right) \\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{2a}\\\\right) Now the correction for tape sag is the difference between the actual span between the supports, k, and the arc length of the tape's catenary, L. Call this correction \\\\delta = k - L. The absolute value of this \\\\delta correction is C_s above, the amount you would subtract from the tape measurement to get the true span distance. A Taylor series expansion of \\\\delta in terms of the quantity L is desired to give a good first approximation to the correction. In fact, the first nonvanishing term in the Taylor series is cubic in L, and the next nonvanishing term is to the fifth power of L; thus, a series expansion for \\\\delta is reasonable. To this end, we need to find an expression for \\\\delta that contains L but not k. We already have an expression for L in terms of k, but now need to find the inverse function (for k in terms of L): :\\\\frac{L}{2a} = \\\\sinh\\\\left(\\\\frac{k}{2a}\\\\right) :\\\\sinh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{2a}\\\\right)= \\\\frac{k}{2a} :k = \\\\left(2a\\\\right) \\\\sinh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{2a}\\\\right) :\\\\delta = k - L = \\\\left(2a\\\\right) \\\\sinh^{-1}\\\\left(\\\\frac{L}{2a}\\\\right) - L Evaluating \\\\delta at L=0 yields zero, so there is no zero-order term in the Taylor series. The first derivative of this function with respect to L is :\\\\frac{d\\\\delta}{dL} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1}}-1 . Evaluated at L=0, it vanishes and so does not contribute a Taylor series term. The second derivative of \\\\delta is :\\\\frac{d^2\\\\delta}{{dL}^2} = -\\\\frac{L}{4 a^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac{L^2}{4 a^2}+1\\\\right)^{3/2}} . Again, when evaluated at L=0 it vanishes. When evaluated at L=0, the third derivative survives, however. :\\\\frac{d^3\\\\delta}{{dL}^3} = -\\\\frac{ \\\\left(8 a^3-4\\\\text{aL}^2\\\\right)}{\\\\left(4 a^2+L^2\\\\right)^{5/2} } Thus, the first surviving term in the Taylor series is: :\\\\delta \\\\cong \\\\left[\\\\frac{d^3\\\\delta}{{dL}^3}\\\\right]_{L=0} \\\\frac{ L^3}{3!} = -\\\\frac{1}{4a^2} \\\\frac{L^3}{6} = \\\\frac{-L^3}{24a^2} = \\\\frac{-L^3 \\\\omega^2 g^2}{24 P^2} Notice that the variable P here is the tension on the cable, whereas above, P is the mass whose gravitational force (mass times gravitational acceleration) equals the tension on the cable. The only conversion necessary then is to take P/g here and equate it to P above. Also, this formula is the tape sag correction to be added to the measured distance, so the negative sign in front can be removed and the tape sag correction can be made instead by subtracting the absolute value as is done in the preceding section. = Correction due to tension = Some tapes are already calibrated to account for the sag at a standard tension. In this case, errors arise when the tape is pulled at a Tension which differs from the standard tension used at standardization. The tape will stretch less than its standard length when a tension less than the standard tension is applied, making the tape too short. A tape stretches in an elastic manner until it reaches its elastic limit, when it will deform permanently and ruin the tape. The correction due to tension is given by: :C_p = \\\\frac{(P_m - P_s)L}{AE} Where: :C_p is the elongation in tape length due to pull; or the correction to be applied due to applying a tension which differs from standard tension; meters; :P_m is the tension applied to the tape during measurement; newtons; :P_s is the standard tension, when the tape is the correct length, often 50 newtons; newtons; :L is the measured or erroneous length of the line; meters :A is the cross-sectional area of the tape; square centimeters; :E is the modulus of elasticity of the tape material; newtons per square centimeter; The correction C_p is added to L to obtain the corrected distance: :d = L + C_p The value for A is given by: :A = \\\\frac {W}{(L)(U_w)} Where: :W is the total weight of the tape; kilograms; :U_w is the unit weight of the tape; kilograms per cubic centimeter. For steel tapes, the value for U_w is 7.866 \\\\times 10^{-3} kg/cm^3. Correction due to incorrect tape length Manufacturers of measuring tapes do not usually guarantee the exact length of tapes, and standardization is a process where a standard temperature and tension are determined at which the tape is the exact length. The nominal length of tapes can be affected by physical imperfections, stretching or wear. Constant use of tapes cause wear, tapes can become kinked and may be improperly repaired when breaks occur. The correction due to tape length is given by: :C_L = Corr \\\\times M_L Where: :CL is the corrected length of the line to be measured or laid out; :ML is the measured length or length to be laid out; :NL is the nominal length of the tape as specified by its mark; :KL is a known length; :Corr is the ratio of measured to actual length \\\\frac {M_L}{K_L}, determined by measuring a known length. In the U.S., some tapes come with United States Bureau of Standards certifications establishing the correction needed per 100' of tape. Note that incorrect tape length introduces a systematic error that must be calibrated periodically.

In the 1910s, King Vajiravudh created the first Thai cartoons, after being introduced to British political cartoons during his education at Oxford University. After the Siamese Revolution of 1932 the first proper comic strips were created by Sawat Chutarop, including Sang Thong and Khun Maun, based on Popeye and Mickey Mouse. In 1952, Pimol Kalasee created the first comic aimed at children, Tuk Ka Ta. During the 21st century several new comics have been created, inspired by Japanese manga including Apaimanee Saga, the first Thai comic that was translated into foreign languages.

Its initial mission statement was to promote the safe, integrated and effective use of UAVs in both military and civilian airspace environments. This mission statement still holds true. UAVS is a traditional trade association. Its role is to interface with government and the regulators ensuring that industry's perspectives, objectives and views are put forward in a constructive manner at the highest possible decision making point. It also promotes the industry and its members and addresses the issues facing the industry on a collective basis.  Core Themes  UAVS pursues four core themes that are critical to the future success of this industry: *Regulation *Certification *Training *Operations UAVs will in future have to be equivalent to and as transparent as manned aircraft if they are to be allowed to fly in controlled airspace. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has published its policy regarding the Operation of UAVs in Controlled Airspace, CAP722. This policy is being adopted around the world by other Aviation Authorities such as the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), the Joint Aviation Authority (JAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Although this is still just policy, UAV airframe constructors and flight control system suppliers face major challenges in meeting the existing regulatory standards in terms of the systems carried on-board but there will be new requirements specific to UAVs, such as Sense & Avoid, which will add to the certification burden. Certification goes hand in with regulation. UAVs need to be proven and reliable systems and meet the same certification criteria as manned aircraft. Many of those currently building UAVs have never had to go through the certification route. In the past certification for military operations has been performed by the military themselves absolving the manufacturers of this requirement but in the future the CAA will look to the manufacturer for that certification assurance. Whether an UAV is going through experimental flying or proving trials or is carrying out the CAA's definition of 'aerial work', i.e. paid flying activity, the UAV pilot and commander have to suitably qualified. Argument abounds as to whether the best UAV pilot is a qualified and experienced manned aircraft pilot or a video game expert. UAVs operate out of line of sight with the UAV pilot dependent on the telemetry and other data returned by the UAV to understand exactly what is happening to the UAV and what it is doing. UAV operators, like civil airline operators, will not be the UAV constructors. UAV operators, like civil airline operators, will be the interface with local, regional, national and international air traffic managers. The operation and interface of UAVs in controlled airspace will have to be seamless to the air traffic managers and to other manned aircraft airspace users. Training of the UAV pilot to the required standard will be essential.

The avenue runs east- west and links Grange Road to the west with Queen's Road to the east. The line of the road continues northeast into central Cambridge as Silver Street. Sidgwick Avenue is flanked by Newnham College, Ridley Hall, Selwyn College, and the Sidgwick Site of the University of Cambridge. Location The majority of the southern side of the avenue is occupied by Newnham College with Ridley Hall, a theological college affiliated with the University, to the east. The Sidgwick Site, which is home to university faculties including Law, History, Economics and Politics, occupies much of the northern side of the road. Lady Mitchell Hall, the Museum of Classical Archaeology, and the Marshall Library of Economics are also located in the Sidgwick Site. https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/pdfs/faculty/Sidgwick_Site_disability_access.pdf To the west is the main part of Selwyn College and east of the Sidgwick site is the Harvey Court site of Gonville and Caius College. The avenue is quite narrow and recent proposals have considered turning it into a pedestrian thoroughfare with carve outs for cycle lanes. History The Old Hall at Newnham College, the first building of the college on Sidgwick Avenue The origins of the Sidgwick Avenue are somewhat unclear, however remains from the Roman period have been found near the area near Selwyn and Newnham Colleges, suggesting some early human settlement and use of the area. The avenue was used under different names in the medieval and Tudor periods, with only sections of it near the City of Cambridge being paved with cobblestones. In the 19th century, the avenue became increasingly important and it was fully paved with cobbles and paving stones, some of which can be seen today. With the growth of Cambridge colleges during the 19th century, including Selwyn and Newnham, the avenue became more busy. Today, Sidgwick Avenue has become quite developed and serves as a link between the City of Cambridge and several colleges. Naming According to the University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue is named after Henry and Eleanor Sidgwick. The early progress of women's rights at Cambridge University owes much to Henry Sidgwick, a Philosophy fellow of Trinity College who championed the cause throughout his life. In 1871, with Anne Clough, the first Principal of Newnham College, and Eleanor Balfour (Sidgwick's future wife), Sidgwick oversaw the purchase of a house for five female students who wished to attend lectures but did not live near enough to the University to do so. The avenue was envisioned as home for several colleges of the university and as a cross-town route to connect the area. In 1875, the first building was built on Sidgwick Avenue site of Newnham College, now called Old Hall. In 1882, the Old Court of Selwyn College was built on the other side of Sidgwick Avenue. https://www.classics.cam.ac.uk/pdfs/faculty/Sidgwick_Site_disability_access.pdf Gallery File:Sidgwick Avenue - geograph.org.uk - 787272.jpgSidgwick Avenue with Newnham to the left and the Sidgwick Site to the right File:Newnham College, Cambridge 003.jpgNewnham College File:Sidgwick Hall and Library - geograph.org.uk - 787408.jpgSidgwick Hall and Library  References  Streets in Cambridge Streets associated with the University of Cambridge Newnham College, Cambridge Selwyn College, Cambridge ","title":"Sidgwick Avenue"},{"id":"23788424","text":"The line VI of the Barcelona Metro network was an ambitious 1965 project for a proposed underground railway line in the city of Barcelona.

Prebisch was born in Tucum√°n, Argentina, to German settlers his brother Ra√∫l Prebisch was a well-known economist.  Education  Prebisch studied at the School of Architecture at the University of Buenos Aires, where guided by professors including Ren√© Karman and Pablo Hary, he graduated in 1921. Upon completing his degree he moved to Paris for two years to complete his training. In Paris he followed the artistic and architectural development of the immediate postwar period in the company of other Argentine artists and architects such as Juan Jos√© Castro and Ernesto Vautier. Two key figures in Prebisch's development were Paul Val√©ry and Tony Garnier, both of whom he interviewed. Valery argued that architects are in the category of intellectual \\"responsible for the great act of building.\\" Garnier focused on the communion between architecture and urbanism, as fundamental characteristic of modernity.  Early Work  He returned to Argentina in 1924 and presented the project \\"Sugar City in the province of Tucum√°n\\" at the Salon de Bellas Artes. This proposal tried to recreate, on a local scale, the model and modality used by Gamier in France. In 1924 he also began his writing, publishing his interview with Paul Val√©ry. He also made his debut as an art critic and, as a proponent of modernism, started to write in different media about architecture and urban planning, art and music. With Ernesto Vautier he completed the Market of Tucum√°n in 1927 though it was an inevitable concession to time and place conceived in a neo- colonial style. Corbusier visited Argentina at this time and it was during this visit that Prebisch formed a bond with Victoria Ocampo. In 1931 he completed what was the first paradigm of a modern house in Argentina, that of his brother Ra√∫l Prebisch, on Luis Maria Campos Avenue, which has sinced demolished. Prebisch won a scholarship grant from the Ambassador of the United States in Argentina, Robert Woods BIiss, and between the end of 1933 and the middle of 1934 completed a stay of several months in the United States. Based in New York, he visited several cities on the East Coast to analyze the architecture of museums and concert halls in that country. He was impressed with the dimensions, pragmatism, and aesthetic bias of modern American architecture developments which was to have a lasting impression in his work.  Major Works  In the years immediately after his return to Argentina, Prebisch completed his two most famous work both in Buenos Aires. In 1936 he was entrusted with the project of a monument for the Plaza de la Rep√∫blica in commemoration of the fourth centenary of the founding of Buenos Aires. The result was the construction of the now iconic Obelisk of Buenos Aires - based on the a return to the sources of classicism in geometry. These premises were common to the plan of Washington D.C, which was being completed during Prebisch's visit. There is a clear influence on Buenos Aires complex from the obelisk and to the mega-architecture of the Federal Triangle of the North American capital. His other major work, the Rationalist Teatro Gran Rex, was built in just seven months in association with the engineer Adolfo Moret. Its opening in 1937 caused a sensation in different areas. Victoria Ocampo praised him, thanking the purifying action that he would exert on the taste of the general public. It was, indeed, a fundamental milestone in the acceptance of modernity on a massive scale and a model of aesthetic renewal for commercial and entertainment architecture. The purist image of the exterior of the building is dramatically emphasized in the interior of the entrance hall by the bold structure of large lights and cantilevers. Prebisch's career as an architect continued through the 1930s and 1940s including buildings designed for Victoria Ocampo. The one built on Calle Chile1368 (1935) is an excellent example of his ability to synthesize a purist aesthetic, a rational construction, and a functional layout. A certain North American-style versatility would allow him to incorporate exact exposed brick planes on the fronts of this work, constituting the first signs of expressiveness of materials in modern Argentine architecture. The Tucum√°n buildings 675 and 699 (1938) follow this trend, completely covering the strict fronts with exposed brick walls. In the store called \\"The Economic Emporium\\" (1941), he surprised with a work in the heart of the city that established its resounding expressiveness in a monumental curtain wall of wood and glass. He later built the Gran Rex Cinema in Rosario (1945) and the Victoria Theater in Salta (1945). He was appointed Dean of the School of Architecture of the University of Buenos Aires in 1955 and, in 1962‚Äì63, served as interim Mayor of Buenos Aires. Returning to the School of Architecture as Dean in 1968, he was named Director of the National Fine Arts Academy in 1970, and died months later in that capacity at age 71.

The type species is A. ardevoli, described in 2009 by Pereda-Suberbiola et al., a group of researchers from Spain. The genus name refers to Ar√©n, where it was found, and the specific epithet honours geologist Llu√≠s Ard√®vol. The estimated body length of Arenysaurus is . Arenysaurus was a lambeosaurine, a member of the hadrosaurid subfamily with hollow cranial crests. Arenysaurus is one of the most complete and best dated ever found in the Late Cretaceous period.  Description  Arenysaurus was found in a small village (350 inhabitants) in the Aragonese Pyrenees called Ar√©n (Areny in Catalan). The townspeople of Areny worked day and night helping the paleontologists. For this reason the paleontologists dedicated the dig site to Areny. The original bones can be seen in a museum that was built in the town. The museum also houses reconstructions and videos of the dig. An exact replica has been constructed of the bones from where the Arenysaurus fossils were found in the very position which they were found.

It demands that the actions and events in a play should be believable. The principle was sometimes used to criticize soliloquy (speaking to the audience), and in late classical plays characters are almost invariably supplied with confidants (valets, friends, nurses) to whom they reveal their emotions. In literature, vraisemblance refers to ways 'in which a text may be brought into contact with and defined in relation to another text which helps make it intelligible' (Culler, pp. 140). Jonathan Culler suggests five different levels of vraisemblance in literature: #A socially given text taken as the 'real world' #A general cultural text in which a shared knowledge is recognizable #Texts of genre conventions #Self-referential texts that cite and expose genre conventions #Intertextual texts where 'one work takes another as its basis or point of departure and must be assimilated in relation to it' (Culler, pp. 140) See also * Theatre of France: 17th century Classicism * French literature of the 17th century References * Theatre in France French literature Early Modern literature ","title":"Vraisemblance"},{"id":"23788710","text":"Micha√´l Tronche (born August 7, 1978) is a footballer.

Biography Jones was born in Oxford, where her father, Oliver, was a cooper.Greene, Richard; Jones, William R.

Blackwell. . p. 300 and senior chaplain of Christ Church, Oxford. Jones learnt French and Italian in childhood. Despite living modestly with her brother in Oxford for most of her life, by 1730 she had become a friend of the Hon. Martha Lovelace, who was a daughter of John Lovelace, 4th Baron Lovelace and a Maid of Honour to Queen Caroline. Jones wrote poems in private letters to Lovelace and her well-connected circle of female friends and relations. Through them, Jones was able to occasionally leave Oxford, and stay at their country houses. In April 1742, she was surprised to discover that one of her works, The Lass of the Hill, had been published without her knowledge, around the same time as her epitaph to Lord Aubrey Beauclerk was printed by his widow without consulting Jones. Jones was modest about her poetry, and apparently did not consider publishing her efforts until pushed to do so by her friends. In 1750, her wealthy friends financed the publication of Miscellanies in Prose and Verse,Miscellanies in Prose and Verse which was to be her only volume of poetry published, though individual poems appeared in The London Magazine in 1752 and the anthology Poems by Eminent Ladies in 1755. The book was well- received, and was given \\"a long and glowing review\\" by Ralph Griffiths. Samuel Johnson, who met Jones on his visits to Oxford, called her \\"the Chantress\\",Boswell, James (1791) The Life of Samuel Johnson, vol. 1, p. 322 and Thomas Warton recalled her as \\"a most sensible, agreeable and amiable woman\\". In her Epistle to Lady Bowyer, Jones admits to being overshadowed by Alexander Pope, who is clearly an influence in her writings. Her poetry is witty and gently satirical, and pokes mild fun at courtly manners, but is never vicious or biting. Jones was postmistress of Oxford at her death, and was buried there on 14 February 1778.

The Parliamentarian victory presaged the end of the Second English Civil War. Campaign On 8 July 1648, when the Scottish Engager army crossed the Border in support of the English Royalist, the military situation was well defined. For the Parliamentarians, Cromwell besieged Pembroke in South Wales, Fairfax besieged Colchester in Essex, and Colonel Edward Rossiter besieged Pontefract and Scarborough in the north. On 11 July, Pembroke fell and Colchester followed on 28 August. Elsewhere, however, the rebellion, which had been put down by rapidity of action rather than sheer weight of numbers, still smouldered. Charles, the Prince of Wales, with the fleet cruised along the Essex coast. Cromwell and John Lambert, however, understood each other perfectly, while the Scottish commanders quarrelled with each other and with Sir Marmaduke Langdale (the English Royalist commander in the north west). As the English Royalist uprisings were close to collapse, it was on the adventures of the Engager Scottish army that the interest of the war centred. It was by no means the veteran army of the Earl of Leven, which had long been disbanded. For the most part it consisted of raw levies and, as the Kirk Party had refused to sanction The Engagement (an agreement between Charles I and the Scots Parliament for the Scots to intervene in England on behalf of Charles), David Leslie and thousands of experienced officers and men declined to serve. The leadership of the Duke of Hamilton proved to be a poor substitute for that of Leslie. Hamilton's army, too, was so ill provided that as soon as England was invaded it began to plunder the countryside for the bare means of sustenance. On 8 July the Scots, with Langdale as advanced guard, were about Carlisle, and reinforcements from Ulster were expected daily. Lambert's horse were at Penrith, Hexham and Newcastle, too weak to fight and having only skilful leading and rapidity of movement to enable them to gain time. Appleby Castle surrendered to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still hanging on to the flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or to find out what was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him, at Nottingham, and, gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August Cromwell was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave. Hamilton was at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists. Battle On 14 August 1648 Cromwell and Lambert were at Skipton, on 15 August at Gisburn and on 16 August they marched down the valley of the Ribble towards Preston with full knowledge of the enemy's dispositions and full determination to attack him. They had with them horse and foot not only of the Army, but also of the militia of Yorkshire, Durham, Northumberland and Lancashire, and withal were slightly outnumbered, having only 8,600 men against perhaps 9,000 of Hamilton's command. But the latter were scattered for convenience of supply along the road from Lancaster, through Preston, towards Wigan, Langdale's corps having thus become the left flank guard instead of the advanced guard. Langdale called in his advanced parties, perhaps with a view to resuming the duties of advanced guard, on the night of 13 August, and collected them near Longridge. It is not clear whether he reported Cromwell's advance, but, if he did, Hamilton ignored the report, for on 17 August Monro was half a day's march to the north, Langdale east of Preston, and the main army strung out on the road to Wigan, Major-General William Baillie with a body of foot, the rear of the column, being still in Preston. Hamilton, yielding to the importunity of his lieutenant-general, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, sent Baillie across the Ribble to follow the main body just as Langdale, with 3,000 foot and 500 horse only, met the first shock of Cromwell's attack on Preston Moor. Hamilton, like Charles at Edgehill, passively shared in, without directing, the Battle of Preston, and, though Langdale's men fought magnificently, they were after four hours' struggle driven to the Ribble. Baillie attempted to cover the Ribble and Darwen bridges on the Wigan road, but Cromwell had forced his way across both before nightfall. Pursuit was at once undertaken, and not relaxed until Hamilton had been driven through Wigan and Winwick to Uttoxeter and Ashbourne. There, pressed furiously in rear by Cromwell's horse and held up in front by the militia of the midlands, the remnant of the Scottish army laid down its arms on 25 August. Various attempts were made to raise the Royalist standard in Wales and elsewhere, but Preston was the death-blow to the Royalist hopes in the Second Civil War. Cromwell estimated the Royalist losses at 2,000 killed and 9,000 captured. Those among the prisoners who had served voluntarily were bound for servile labour in the New World, and when there was no more demand there, for service in the Republic of Venice When the English Parliament decreed a day of thanksgiving for the victory, it was announced that Cromwell's army had \\"one hundred at the most\\" killed. In Literature The Battle of Preston is depicted in Robert Neil's historical novel \\"Witch Bane\\". As noted by Neil in his historical note, it is difficult to reconstruct with certainty precisely where in Preston the battle took place. The only contemporary accounts with much authority are those of Sir Marmaduke Langdale and of Cromwell in his letter to Mr. Speaker Lenthall. Both accounts are weak on topography, since neither of the military commanders knew the ground. Neil's protagonists are two women, caught up in the fighting, desperately trying to survive while also deeply worried about their respective lovers who are fighting on opposing sides. The topography is crucial to the plot's depiction of the women trying to escape the fighting. Before writing, Neil studied extensively the existing sources and walked repeatedly around the battleground. What Cromwell described as \\"A lane, very deep and ill, up to the Enemy's army and leading to the Town\\" is also mentioned by Sir Marmaduke, who blames his Scottish allies for having failed to secure that lane, whose eventual capture enabled the Parliamentary forces to outflank the Royalists. Neil's plot and the route taken by his protagonists is based on the assumption that this crucial lane followed more or less the line of the present A59 road through Brockholes to Blackburn. Neil concedes, however, that other interpretations of the battle's topography are possible. (Quotes from Neil's historical note are from Robert Neil, \\"Witch Bane\\", Arrow Books, London 1968.)

Plot The film is about a K-9 dog named Ace. The police are trying to catch a burglar whom they have nicknamed \\"Goliath\\". Out on a call, the police and their dogs are on the track of the thief, Torco (Dopud). After a pursuit in the woods, Ace takes down Torco, out of sight of his human partner, Dan (Cain), who soon arrives. When police see injuries to Torco's neck, they believe they are the results of Ace biting him. And Torco does not face charges as the evidence against him is sketchy. Officials demand Ace be euthanized because he's now classified as 'a biter'. Dan drives Ace to the vet hospital in Spokane, and leaves him to be put down. Dan goes to the capture scene and sees the area is under 24-hour video surveillance. He also finds a piece of barbed wire, which he believes Torco used to slash himself with. Dan tries to convince his captain that Ace is innocent and to stop the euthanasia, but to no avail. The surveillance video is being 'cleaned up' by technicians. Meanwhile Ace has trickily escaped the vet hospital, and heads home. The veterinary technician, not wanting to have his incompetence found out, puts some other ashes from the crematory into a container and marks them as Ace's. Dan tries to get over the grief of losing Ace by trying out other dogs, but to no success. Ace, while making his way back to Dan, captures a petty-thief and is lauded by the media. Dan's daughter, Julia (McKillip), sees Ace on a TV news show, but her parents do not believe it is Ace, since his supposed cremated remains are just then delivered to their home by mail. But Julia eventually convinces Dan to take her to Wenatchee to see if the dog is Ace. When they arrive Ace has just escaped again. During their drive back home, sleepy Julia sees Ace, who has hopped into the back of a towed car. Ace sees her and waves, which is a trick she taught him. But Dan 'convinces' Julia she was probably just dreaming, and they proceed home. Dan's police captain brings him in to show him the surveillance tape of the capture. It shows Torco first fending off Ace with barbed wire, but then slashing himself with it. Dan was right all along, and he is upset with the captain. Meanwhile, Julia stakes out Torco's house since she, too, believes he framed Ace. But while looking around, she 'accidentally' breaks in, and then finds incriminating evidence. Torco comes home from work early and sees Julia leaving. After entering his house he discovers evidence that Julia had been inside. Torco goes to Julia's house. After Julia returns home, as she tells her mother (Loder) about Torco, the two of them are pursued by Torco, but Ace comes to the rescue just-in- time, and brings down Torco. But Torco stabs Ace with a piece of broken glass. Dan arrives home and Torco is arrested. Ace is taken to a vet hospital and will recover. Dan then allows Julia to take Ace to the K-9 competition, where Ace wins first place. While Julia plays with Ace in the family's backyard, Dan agrees to take his wife to Tahiti, for their long-ago 'postponed' honeymoon, and the end credits roll.

WikiJournal of Medicine 6(1): 8  https://doi.org/10.15347/wjm/2019.008 with the chemical formula . Pure TCDD is a colorless solid with no distinguishable odor at room temperature. It is usually formed as an unwanted product in burning processes of organic materials or as a side product in organic synthesis. TCDD is the most potent compound (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War. TCDD was released into the environment in the Seveso disaster. It is a persistent organic pollutant.  Mechanism of action  TCDD and dioxin-like compounds act via a specific receptor present in all cells: the aryl hydrocarbon (AH) receptor. This receptor is a transcription factor which is involved in the expression of genes; in fact it has been shown that high doses of TCDD either increase or decrease the expression of several hundred genes in rats. Genes of enzymes activating the breakdown of foreign and often toxic compounds are classic examples of such genes (enzyme induction). TCDD increases the enzymes breaking down, e.g., carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene. These polycyclic hydrocarbons also activate the AH receptor, but less than TCDD and only temporarily. Even many natural compounds present in vegetables cause some activation of the AH receptor.) This phenomenon can be viewed as adaptive and beneficial, because it protects the organism from toxic and carcinogenic substances. Excessive and persistent stimulation of AH receptor, however, leads to a multitude of adverse effects. The physiological function of the AH receptor has been the subject of continuous research. One obvious function is to increase the activity of enzymes breaking down foreign chemicals or normal chemicals of the body as needed. There seem to be many other functions, however, related to the development of various organs and the immune systems or other regulatory functions. The AH receptor is phylogenetically highly conserved transcription factor with a history of at least 600 million years and is found in all vertebrates. Its ancient analogs are important regulatory proteins even in more primitive species. In fact, knock-out animals with no AH receptor are prone to illness and developmental problems. Taken together, this implies the necessity of a basal degree of AH receptor activation to achieve normal physiological function.  Toxicity in humans  In 2000, the Expert Group of the World Health Organization considered developmental toxicity as the most pertinent risk of dioxins to human beings. Because people are usually exposed simultaneously to several dioxin-like chemicals, a more detailed account is given at dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. = Developmental effects = In Vietnam and the United States, teratogenic or birth defects were observed in children of persons who were exposed to Agent Orange or 2,4,5-T that contained TCDD as an impurity out of the production process. However there has been some uncertainty on the causal link between Agent Orange/dioxin exposure. In 2006 a meta-analysis indicated large amount of heterogeneity between studies and emphasized a lack of consensus on the issue. Still-births, cleft palate, and neural tube defects, with spina bifida were the most statistically significant defects. Later some tooth defects and borderline neurodevelopmental effects have been reported. After Seveso accident tooth development defects, changed sex ratio and decreased sperm quality have been noted. Various developmental effects have been clearly shown after high mixed exposures to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds, the most dramatic in Yusho and Yu-chen catastrophes, in Japan and Taiwan, respectively. = Cancer = It is largely agreed that TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic. Its main action is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem to be dependent on life stage, being anti-estrogenic when estrogen is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of estrogen. TCDD was classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a carcinogen for humans (group 1). In the occupational cohort studies available for the classification, the risk was weak and borderline detectable, even at very high exposures. Therefore, the classification was, in essence, based on animal experiments and mechanistic considerations. This was criticized as a deviation from IARC's 1997 classification rules. The main problem with IARC classification is that it only assesses qualitative hazard, i.e. carcinogenicity at any dose, and not the quantitative risk at different doses. According to a 2006 Molecular Nutrition & Food Research article, there were debates on whether TCDD was carcinogenic only at high doses which also cause toxic damage of tissues. A 2011 review concluded that, after 1997, further studies did not support an association between TCDD exposure and cancer risk. One of the problems is that in all occupational studies the subjects have been exposed to a large number of chemicals, not only TCDD. By 2011, it was reported that studies that include the update of Vietnam veteran studies from Operation Ranch Hand, had concluded that after 30 years the results did not provide evidence of disease. On the other hand, the latest studies on Seveso population support TCDD carcinogenicity at high doses. In 2004, an article in the International Journal of Cancer provided some direct epidemiological evidence that TCDD or other dioxins are not causing soft-tissue sarcoma at low doses, although this cancer has been considered typical for dioxins. There was in fact a trend of cancer to decrease. This is called a J-shape dose-response, low doses decrease the risk, and only higher doses increase the risk, according to a 2005 article in the journal Dose-Response. = Safety recommendations = The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) derived in 2001 a provisional tolerable monthly intake (PTMI) of 70 pg TEQ/kg body weight. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established an oral reference dose (RfD) of 0.7 pg/kg b.w. per day for TCDD (see discussion on the differences in). According to the Aspen Institute, in 2011, \\"The general environmental limit in most countries is 1,000 ppt TEq in soils and 100 ppt in sediment. Most industrialized countries have dioxin concentrations in soils of less than 12 ppt. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry has determined that levels higher than 1,000 ppt TEq in soil require intervention, including research, surveillance, health studies, community and physician education, and exposure investigation. The EPA is considering reducing these limits to 72 ppt TEq. This change would significantly increase the potential volume of contaminated soil requiring treatment.\\" Animal toxicology By far most information on toxicity of dioxin-like chemicals is based on animal studies utilizing TCDD. Almost all organs are affected by high doses of TCDD. In short-term toxicity studies in animals, the typical effects are anorexia and wasting, and even after a huge dose animals die only 1 to 6 weeks after the TCDD administration. Seemingly similar species have varying sensitivities to acute effects: lethal dose for a guinea pig is about 1 ¬µg/kg, but to a hamster it is more than 1,000 ¬µg/kg. A similar difference can be seen even between two different rat strains. Various hyperplastic (overgrowth) or atrophic (wasting away) responses are seen in different organs, thymus atrophy is very typical in several animal species. TCDD also affects the balance of several hormones. In some species, but not in all, severe liver toxicity is seen. Taking into account the low doses of dioxins in the present human population, only two types of toxic effects have been considered to cause a relevant risk to humans: developmental effects and cancer. = Developmental effects = Developmental effects occur at very low doses in animals. They include frank teratogenicity such as cleft palate and hydronephrosis. Development of some organs may be even more sensitive: very low doses perturb the development of sexual organs in rodents, and the development of teeth in rats. The latter is important in that tooth deformities were also seen after the Seveso accident and possibly after a long breast-feeding of babies in the 1970s and 1980s when the dioxin concentrations in Europe were about ten times higher than at present. = Cancer = Cancers can be induced in animals at many sites. At sufficiently high doses TCDD has caused cancer in all animals tested. The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, and this has long been a basis for risk assessment. Dose-response of TCDD in causing cancer does not seem to be linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage. TCDD may in some conditions potentiate the carcinogenic effects of other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly detoxified by conjugation, but some molecules may escape to the nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.  Sources  TCDD has never been produced commercially except as a pure chemical for scientific research. It is, however, formed as a synthesis side product when producing certain chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. It may also be formed along with other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofuranes in any burning of hydrocarbons where chlorine is present, especially if certain metal catalysts such as copper are also present. Usually a mixture of dioxin-like compounds is produced, therefore a more thorough treatise is under dioxins and dioxin-like compounds. The greatest production occurs from waste incineration, metal production, and fossil-fuel and wood combustion.DHHS: Report on Carcinogens, Twelfth Edition (2011) (accessed 2013-08-01) Dioxin production can usually be reduced by increasing the combustion temperature. Total U.S. emissions of PCCD/Fs were reduced from ca. 14 kg TEq in 1987 to 1.4 kg TEq in 2000.Jouko Tuomisto &al.;: Synopsis on Dioxins and PCBs (accessed 2013-08-01), p.40; using data from EPA's National Center for Environmental Assessment  Cases of exposure  A photograph of Viktor Yushchenko after he was poisoned by TCDD. TCDD often causes disfiguring facial swelling There have been numerous incidents where people have been exposed to high doses of TCDD. *In 1976, thousands of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy were exposed to TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. Many animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, as well as some developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but the evidence is not very strong. *In Times Beach, Missouri, several hundred people were poisoned by extremely high concentrations of TCDD by Russell Martin Bliss, who sprayed it on dusty roads to avoid large dust clouds, who himself obtained the TCDD from NEPACCO, a company that produced Agent Orange. No one was ever charged in relation to the incident, and the city of Times Beach was abandoned and disincorporated following an investigation by the CDC and EPA. This is marked as the single largest contamination of a civilian area by TCDD in United States history. *In Vienna, two women were poisoned at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations in one of them were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about 100,000 times the concentrations in most people today and about 10,000 times the sum of all dioxin-like compounds in young people today. They survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997 but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence of crime, and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings. *In 2004, presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko of Ukraine was poisoned with a large dose of TCDD. His blood TCDD concentration was measured 108,000 pg/g of fat, which is the second highest ever measured. This concentration implies a dose exceeding 2 mg, or 25 Œºg/kg of body weight. He suffered from chloracne for many years, but after initial malaise, other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings were few. * An area of polluted land in Italy, known as the Triangle of death, is contaminated with TCDD from years of illegal waste disposal by organized crime.

The basic concept is the reduction of multitudinous amounts of data down to the meaningful parts. When information is derived from instrument readings there may also be a transformation from analog to digital form. When the data are already in digital form the 'reduction' of the data typically involves some editing, scaling, encoding, sorting, collating, and producing tabular summaries. When the observations are discrete but the underlying phenomenon is continuous then smoothing and interpolation are often needed. The data reduction is often undertaken in the presence of reading or measurement errors. Some idea of the nature of these errors is needed before the most likely value may be determined. An example in astronomy is the data reduction in the Kepler satellite. This satellite records 95-megapixel images once every six seconds, generating dozens of megabytes of data per second, which is orders-of-magnitudes more than the downlink bandwidth of 550 KBps. The on-board data reduction encompasses co-adding the raw frames for thirty minutes, reducing the bandwidth by a factor of 300. Furthermore, interesting targets are pre-selected and only the relevant pixels are processed, which is 6% of the total. This reduced data is then sent to Earth where it is processed further. Research has also been carried out on the use of data reduction in wearable (wireless) devices for health monitoring and diagnosis applications. For example, in the context of epilepsy diagnosis, data reduction has been used to increase the battery lifetime of a wearable EEG device by selecting, and only transmitting, EEG data that is relevant for diagnosis and discarding background activity. Best practices These are common techniques used in data reduction. * Order by some aspect of size. * Table diagonalization, whereby rows and columns of tables are re-arranged to make patterns easier to see (refer to the diagram). * Round drastically to one, or at most two, effective digits (effective digits are ones that vary in that part of the data). * Use averages to provide a visual focus as well as a summary. * Use layout and labeling to guide the eye. * Remove chartjunk, such as pictures and lines. * Give a brief verbal summary.http://business.nmsu.edu/~mhyman/M610_Articles/Ehrenberg_Marketing_Research_2001.pdf Data, but No Information: Presentation really is everything ‚Äî or close to it.

Lund was born in Bergen as a son of Lt.-Col. Henrik Louis Bull Lund (1838‚Äì1891) and pianist and composer Birgitte Theodora Carlsen (1843‚Äì1913). His sister was composer Signe Lund. He spent much of his young days at sea and probably had a naval career in mind. However, he was not admitted to the Norwegian Naval Academy.Henrik Lund (Norsk biografisk leksikon) He moved to Kristiania, where he met painting student Per Deberitz, who was a student of Hans Gude and who probably turned Lund's interest to this profession. He was a pupil of Harriet Backer (1899), debuted the same year, and studied further with Johan Nordhagen (1903). Lund had his first exhibit in 1899 and his first Autumn Exhibit in 1901. He lived in Paris (1905, 1920‚Äì21) and exhibited in Berlin (1908). He lived in Copenhagen from 1904 to 1909 and broke through here. He held several notable exhibitions, including \\"The Six\\" in Berlin and Copenhagen in 1911. He belonged to a group of early-1900s young painters called the Neo-Impressionists. He befriended such painters as Ludvig Karsten, S√∏ren Onsager, Bernhard Folkestad, Arne Kavli, Theodor Laureng and Anders Svarstad, and drew inspiration from Karsten, Edvard Munch and Christian Krohg. In the years before the First World War began, Lund was interested in pure landscapes, open and airy impressions of nature. He found motifs in the Oslo Fjord, Holmsbu and Nordland, but first and foremost at his summer place near Krager√∏ on Sk√•t√∏y. He had a special affinity towards landscapes and portrait painting. However, both as a painter and printmaker, he is primarily known for his portraits. He painted many of the leading men and women in business, culture and politics. Lund was also a skilled administrator and a persistent advocate for his artist colleagues. Over the years he held a variety of administrative posts, both at home and abroad. In 1911 he held an exhibition for young Norwegian artists (\\"The six\\") at Cassirer in Berlin and Copenhagen. In 1912, he took a large Scandinavian exhibition on tour in the United States. He served on the art jury for the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition at Frogner and was chairman of the Association of Norwegian Printmakers (1919-1925). One of his last assignments was as a juror at an exhibition in Pittsburgh during 1935. His works can be found in the National Gallery of Norway in Oslo, which owns 13 of his pictures, in the Norwegian Parliament and inb the National Theatre, among others. Personal life His sister was the composer and pianist Signe Lund (1868‚Äì1950). In 1900, he married Gunbj√∏r Olsen (1880‚Äì1965). He was the father-in-law of art historian Johan Henrik Langaard (1899‚Äì1988).

Life Depiction above the main door to St Aidan's Church, Leeds Memorial to Bishop John Russell Woodford in Ely Cathedral Born on 30 April 1820 at Henley-on- Thames, he was the only son of James Russell Woodford, a hop-merchant in Southwark, and Frances, daughter of Robert Appleton of Henley. He was sent to Merchant Taylors' School at the age of eight, and was elected to Pembroke College, Cambridge, as Parkins exhibitioner in 1838. He graduated B.A. in 1842, and M.A. in 1845. He was ordained deacon in 1843 and priest in 1845, and in the intervening years held the second mastership of Bishop's College, Bristol. His first incumbency was the parish of St. Saviour's, Coalpit-heath, Bristol. He then worked as vicar of the parish of St. Mark's, Easton, in the same district, between 1847 and 1855, and in the latter year was presented to the vicarage of Kempsford, Gloucestershire. Woodford was one of the eighteen clergy who in the following year signed the protest against the primate John Bird Sumner's condemnation of Archdeacon George Anthony Denison. During the thirteen years he was at Kempsford he attracted attention as a preacher, and was made by Bishop Samuel Wilberforce one of his examining chaplains, Woodford became honorary canon of Christchurch, and in 1864 was for the first time a select preacher at Cambridge, He also acted as proctor for the clergy of his diocese in the Canterbury convocation, In 1868 Woodford was appointed vicar of Leeds. In 1869 he received a D.D. degree from the primate, and in 1872 was appointed one of the queen's chaplains. In the following year he succeeded Harold Browne as bishop of Ely, being consecrated in Westminster Abbey on 14 December 1873. Soon after his succession to the see Woodford set on foot a general diocesan fund to be applied towards the increase of church accommodation and the assistance of poor parishes and incumbents. He was very active in the work of church restoration, and he reconstructed the cathedral school at Ely. In 1877 he revived, after a disuse of nearly 150 years, the visitation of the cathedral church. Woodford also established Ely Theological College, where twelve students were housed and trained for parochial work, Woodford died, unmarried, at Ely on 21 October 1885. He was buried in Bishop Wren's chapel on the south side of the cathedral choir on the 30th. Works Woodford published: * The Church, Past and Present, 1852. * Seventeen Sermons, 1854; 2nd ed. 1860. * Six Lectures on the Creed, 1855. * Occasional Sermons, 1st ser 1856, 2nd ed. 1864; 2nd ser. 1861, 2nd ed. 1865. * Christian Sanctity, four sermons at Cambridge, 1863. He also contributed to Sermons for the Working Classes, 1858, and to the series of New Testament Commentaries, 1870; and wrote prefaces for William Baker's Manual of Devotion, 1877, William Arthur Brameld's In Type and Shadow, 1880, and The Private Devotions of Bishop Andrewes, 1883. Woodford was co-editor with Hyde Wyndham Beadon of the Parish Hymn Book, 1883, and assisted in the compilation of the Sarum Hymnal in 1868. In 1864 he edited the third series of Tracts for the Christian Seasons, and in 1877 a volume of Samuel Wilberforce's Sermons on various Occasions. The Great Commission: Twelve Ordination Addresses (1886, 8vo), and Sermons on Subjects from the Old Testament (1887, 8vo; 2nd ed. 1888), appeared posthumously, edited by H. M. Luckock.

Since 1983, it has been located in a purpose-built gallery on the first floor of the Faculty of Classics on the Sidgwick Site of the University. The museum is one of the few surviving collections of plaster casts of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture in the world. The collection consists of several hundred casts, including casts of some of the most famous surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures. Noteworthy casts include those of the Laoco√∂n and His Sons, the Farnese Hercules, the Barberini Faun and Charioteer of Delphi. The Peplos Kore is perhaps the best known exhibit in the museum. It is a plaster cast of an ancient Greek statue of a young woman painted brightly as the original would have been, which was set up on the Acropolis of Athens, around 530 BCE. In 1975, the museum attempted to replicate the sculpture's original appearance by painting a cast of the figure. The replica was then displayed next to a second, unpainted cast as a challenge to the erroneous equation of ancient Greek sculpture with pure white marble. The museum also holds a large collection of sherds and epigraphic squeezes. The museum is open to the public Tuesday to Friday: 10.00am to 5.00pm and on Saturdays in University term time: 10.00am to 1.00pm. The museum is one of eight which make up the University of Cambridge Museums consortium. Its former home on Little St Mary's Lane was designed by Basil Champneys in 1883. In the 1970s it became evident that it was no longer adequate to house the collection, and it is now part of the buildings of Peterhouse.

It was on a passing loop and originally had two platforms with an underpass linking them, however the second platform was later taken out of use and removed, so trains in both directions called at the same platform, although the loop was retained for goods traffic until the line closed. The station was originally known as just Braunston, however it was renamed as Braunston London Road in 1950, to differentiate it from the other station serving the village. Despite its small size, Braunston was also served by Braunston and Willoughby station on the former Great Central Main Line, which served Braunston and the village of Willoughby, which it was closer to.

The infamous Moor Stand is well known especially by the players who revive a onslaught of chants all game long. History The club joined the Wearside League in 1984‚Äì85 and spent just under a decade in that league, their best finish being in 1988‚Äì89 when they finished in seventh place. They folded in March of the 1993‚Äì94 season after picking up two points from their opening 20 games. The team competed in the FA Vase in every season, their best run being in 1991‚Äì92 when they got to the third round. The club reformed and played in local football before joining the Durham Alliance. They won that league in 2007‚Äì08 and joined the Wearside League. The club was elected into the Northern League for the 2009‚Äì10 season, after finishing first in their previous season in the Wearside Football League. Finishing in ninth place in their first season in the second division of the Northern League, they went on to become the Champions of the division with three games remaining. Having anticipated the possibility months before, the team were required to make more improvements to the home ground to be eligible to play in the First Division of the Northern League. Upon ensuring their place in the top division, they finished in ninth place and participated in the FA Cup for the first time.

It was released by North Star Games in 2008 as a follow up to the award-winning Wits & Wagers. Gameplay Say Anything is very similar to Wits & Wagers except players answer open-ended subjective questions instead of trivia questions. The goal of Say Anything is to get people talking about interesting things and laughing. Each round, one player will play the role of 'The Judge'. The Judge draws a card and then asks a question from it. Here are some sample questions: * What's the best action movie of all-time? * Who's the most annoying celebrity in show business? * What's the most important invention of the past century? * What would be the coolest thing to teach a monkey? * What would be the best thing to do on the moon? Each of the other players then writes an answer on a dry erase board, and places it face-up on the table. Once all of the answers are on the table, the Judge secretly chooses their favorite response. Each other player has two tokens to bet on the answer they think the Judge chose as their favorite. Players receive 1 point for each correct bet. The game ends after a set number of rounds, usually 20 or so.

Path (from south to north) From Langvatnet in the south the road passes the lake of Djupvatnet. From here, the mountain of Dalsnibba can be approached via a minor road. The road descends through a series of hairpin turns northwards towards the village of Geiranger, offering views of the Geirangerfjord in the process. From Geiranger, the road ascends the mountainside through another series of hairpin turns; this section of road is known as the √òrnevegen (\\"Eagle Road\\") and reaches a height of above sea level. At Eidsdal, a ferry is required in order to cross the Norddalsfjorden. The ferry connects Eidsdal with Linge, from where the road passes through a number of small settlements, including Sylte, before running through the valleys of Valldalen and Meiadalen. The northernmost section of the road includes the Trollstigen (\\"The Troll Footpath\\"), a further series of hairpin turns which descend a particularly steep mountain. From the Trollstigen the road runs in an approximate north-west direction before terminating at the junction with the E136 highway near √Öndalsnes. =Diagram= ;Skj√•k Municipality, Innlandet county * ‚ÜêStryn, ‚ÜíBismo *18px Langvatnet -- Road closure point in the winter ;Stranda Municipality, M√∏re og Romsdal county *18pxDjupvatnet, highest point on the road () *15px Geirangervegen (hairpin road) *Djupvasshytta; road up to 18pxDalsnibba *24pxKvandall Bridge *18px Opplenskedalen -- Road closure point in the winter *24pxHole Bridge *24pxFl√• Bridge *24px Ferry from Geiranger til Hellesylt (May 1 to September 30, 8 trips per day) *Geiranger village *15px √òrnevegen hairpin turns *24pxOppskreds Tunnel () Road nearby Geiranger ;Fjord Municipality *24pxEidsdalselva Bridge *Eidsdal village * ‚ÜíNorddal *24pxFerry from Eidsdal to Linge over the Norddalsfjorden (10 minutes, 3 trips per hour) * ‚ÜêSj√∏holt *24pxMuri Bridge * ~~24pxFerry from Sylte to Geiranger (June 15 until August 15, 2 trips per day)~~ discontinued 2015 * ‚ÜíTafjord *Sylte village * ‚ÜíD√∏ving *24pxUri Bridge *24pxHols Bridge * ‚ÜíD√∏ving *24pxGudbrandsjuvet Bridge *18px Langdalen -- Road closure point in the winter Through Valldal valley near Langdal ;Rauma Municipality *24pxStigfossen Bridge *18pxTrollstigen hairpin turns *24pxKverna Bridge *18px Hanekamhaug -- Road closure point in the winter * ‚ÜêVeblungsnes *24pxSogge Bridge * ‚Üê√Öndalsnes, ‚ÜíDomb√•s ReferencesExternal links 063 063 063 Skj√•k Fjord (municipality) Stranda Rauma, Norway National Tourist Routes in Norway ","title":"Norwegian County Road 63"},{"id":"23789867","text":"In linguistics, critical language awareness (CLA) refers to an understanding of social, political, and ideological aspects of language, linguistic variation, and discourse. It functions as a pedagogical application of a critical discourse analysis (CDA), which is a research approach that regards language as a social practice. Critical language awareness as a part of language education teaches students how to analyze the language that they and others use. More specifically, critical language awareness is a consideration of how features of language such as words, grammar, and discourse choices reproduce, reinforce, or challenge certain ideologies and struggles for power and dominance. Regarding linguistic variation, Fairclough argued that it is insufficient to teach students to use \\"appropriate\\" language without considering why that language is preferred and who makes that decision (as well as the implications for speakers who do not use \\"appropriate language\\"). CLA generally includes consideration of how a person may be marginalized by speaking a particular way, especially if that way of speaking serves as an index of their race, ethnicity, religion, social status, etc. Because power is reproduced through language, CLA is \\"a prerequisite for effective democratic citizenship, and should therefore be seen as an entitlement for citizens, especially children developing towards citizenship in the educational system\\".  Applications  Critical language awareness has been applied to educating students in South Africa how language was used to maintain and perpetuate the apartheid state.Janks, H. (1993).

They existed between 1999 and 2005. The group was originally conceived by members Michael Angelakos, Adam Schroeder, Maxwell Scott and Jeff Poleon and Will Glazier while attending Amherst Middle School. Brass members William Glazier, Derek Kettner, Sam Korotkin and Andrew DeSabio were added soon after. The band produced their first album The Buffalo Superheroes at BTF tapehouse in 2001. The songs \\"Cool Amherst Party\\" and \\"Call from China\\" achieved internet success later that year by cracking the top 50 played tracks on MP3.com. The band's second album was titled 60 Hertz Signals EP and included the tracks \\"Marilynn, 2 O'Clock and Still Without You, Can't Fight, Flirting Penguins Raging Eskimos, and The Yearbook.\\" Singer/Guitarist/Songwriter Michael Angelakos parted with the group shortly after recording the album, but did make a few guest reappearances with the band, most notably at Amherst High School SpringFest in 2003. Cherry Bing added guitarist Jeffery Czum and singer Shaant Hacikyan, (Both of whom later became members of Cute Is What We Aim For), in the spring of 2003. Their respective first performances came at the aforementioned Amherst SpringFest and the Kenmore High School SpringFest. After returning from a 5-date east coast mini-tour in the late summer of 2003, Andrew Desabio officially parted with the band. Cherry Bing released the Its Your Day Demo and the In A Language All Our Own EP under their new self-coined genre, \\"Rock with Horns.\\" Notable tracks include \\"Stood Here Once,\\" \\"Band-Aid Trophy Case,\\" and the re-release of \\"Hate.\\" The band was featured in the NeXt section of the Buffalo News in 2004 for winning local radio station Kiss 98.5's \\"Battle of the Bands.\\" Cherry Bing took the stage at the Van's Warped Tour in August 2004. October 31, 2004 marked the release of the band's final recording, and final performance, at the now-defunct Showplace Theatre on Grant Street in Buffalo, NY. Years before forming Passion Pit and becoming a purveyor of gossamer synthpop, frontman Michael Angelakos was embedded in a much different music scene: ska. In 1999, while attending high school in Buffalo, New York, he founded a raucous ska band called Cherry Bing. Angelakos put out two releases with the group and played shows around the Upstate New York area before leaving to pursue other projects in 2002 (they would later join the Warped Tour without him in 2004). Though a short-lived venture, footage of his time with Cherry Bing exists, giving fans a window into his pre-Passion Pit days, and shows just how music-oriented he was ‚Äî no matter the genre ‚Äî so early on.

It is characterized by a multifaceted propaganda campaign, a program of enforced ideological conversion and re-education and reportedly a variety of extralegal coercive measures such as arbitrary arrests, forced labor and physical torture, sometimes resulting in death. Falun Gong is a modern qigong discipline combining slow-moving exercises and meditation with a moral philosophy. It was founded by Li Hongzhi, who introduced it to the public in May 1992 in Changchun, Jilin. Following a period of rapid growth in the 1990s, the Communist Party launched a campaign to \\"eradicate\\" Falun Gong on 20 July 1999. An extra-constitutional body called the 6-10 Office was created to lead the persecution of Falun Gong. The authorities mobilized the state media apparatus, judiciary, police, army, the education system, families and workplaces against the group. The campaign was driven by large-scale propaganda through television, newspaper, radio and the Internet. There are reports of systematic torture,(23 March 2000) The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called heretical organizations, Amnesty International illegal imprisonment, forced labor, organ harvesting and abusive psychiatric measures, with the apparent aim of forcing practitioners to recant their belief in Falun Gong. Foreign observers estimate that hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of Falun Gong practitioners have been detained in \\"re-education through labor\\" camps, prisons and other detention facilities for refusing to renounce the spiritual practice. Former prisoners have reported that Falun Gong practitioners consistently received \\"the longest sentences and worst treatment\\" in labor camps, and in some facilities Falun Gong practitioners formed the substantial majority of detainees.Human Rights Watch V.

An initial investigation found that \\"the source of 41,500 transplants for the six year period 2000 to 2005 is unexplained\\" and concluded that \\"there has been and continues today to be large scale organ seizures from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners\\". Ethan Gutmann estimates 65,000 Falun Gong practitioners were killed for their organs from 2000 to 2008.Ethan Gutmann (10 March 2011) \\"How many harvested?\\" revisited , eastofethan.com Following additional analysis, the researchers significantly raised the estimates on the number of Falun Gong practitioners who may have been targeted for organ harvesting. In 2008 United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for \\"the Chinese government to fully explain the allegation of taking vital organs from Falun Gong practitioners and the source of organs for the sudden increase in organ transplants that has been going on in China since the year 2000\\".Market Wired (8 May 2008) China's Organ Harvesting Questioned Again by UN Special Rapporteurs: FalunHR Reports Retrieved 26 October 2014 Background Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a form of spiritual qigong practice that involves meditation, energy exercises, and a set of moral principles that guide practitioners' daily lives. The principles they espouse‚Äî\\"truthfulness, compassion, forbearance\\"‚Äîhave been repeated by Falun Gong members to outsiders as a tactic for evading deeper inquiry.Kavan, H. (2008). \\"Falun Gong in the media: What can we believe?\\". Power and Place: Refereed Proceedings of the Australian and New Zealand Communication Association Conference. (pp. 1 - 23). Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi instructs his followers to deflect from fact when talking to outsiders, contradictory to his teachings about \\"Truthfulness\\". The practice of Falun Gong was first taught publicly by Li in Northeast China in the spring of 1992, towards the end of China's \\"qigong boom.\\" Falun Gong initially enjoyed considerable official support during the early years of its development. It was promoted by the state-run Qigong Association and other government agencies. By the mid-1990s, however, Chinese authorities sought to rein in the influence of qigong practices and enacted more stringent requirements on the country's various qigong denominations. In 1995 authorities mandated that all qigong groups establish Communist Party branches. The government also sought to formalize ties with Falun Gong and exercise greater control over the practice. Falun Gong resisted co-optation, and instead filed to withdraw altogether from the state-run qigong association. Following this severance of ties to the state, the group came under increasing criticism and surveillance from the country's security apparatus and propaganda department. Falun Gong books were banned from further publication in July 1996, and official news outlets began criticizing the group as a form of \\"feudal superstition,\\" whose \\"theistic\\" orientation was at odds with the official ideology and national agenda. Tensions continued to escalate through the late 1990s. By 1999, surveys estimated as many as 70 million people were practicing Falun Gong in China. Although some government agencies and senior officials continued expressing support for the practices, others grew increasingly wary of its size and capacity for independent organization. On 22 April 1999, several dozen Falun Gong practitioners were beaten and arrested in the city of Tianjin while staging a peaceful sit-in. The practitioners were told that the arrest order came from the Ministry of Public Security, and that those arrested could be released only with the approval of Beijing authorities.Ethan Gutmann, An Occurrence on Fuyou Street, National Review 13 July 2009. On 25 April, upwards of 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners assembled peacefully near the Zhongnanhai government compound in Beijing to request the release of the Tianjin practitioners and an end to the escalating harassment against them. It was Falun Gong practitioners' attempt to seek redress from the leadership by going to them and, \\"albeit very quietly and politely, making it clear that they would not be treated so shabbily.\\"Benjamin Penny, The Past, Present, and Future of Falun Gong, 2001. Retrieved 16 March 2008 It was the first mass demonstration at the Zhongnanhai compound in the PRC's history, and the largest protest in Beijing since 1989. Several Falun Gong representatives met with then-premier Zhu Rongji, who assured them that the government was not against Falun Gong, and promised that the Tianjin practitioners would be released. The crowd outside dispersed peacefully, apparently believing that their demonstration had been a success. Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was less conciliatory, and called on Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China to find a decisive solution to the Falun Gong problem. Statewide persecution On the night of 25 April 1999, then-Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin issued a letter indicating his desire to see Falun Gong defeated. The letter expressed alarm at Falun Gong's popularity, particularly among Communist Party members.Jiang Zemin, \\"Letter to Party cadres on the evening of April 25, 1999\\" republished in Beijing Zhichun (Beijing Spring) no. 97, June 2001. He reportedly called the Zhongnanhai protest \\"the most serious political incident since the '4 June' political disturbance in 1989.\\"Penny, The Religion of Falun Gong, p 65. At a meeting of the Politburo on 7 June 1999, Jiang described Falun Gong as a grave threat to Communist Party authority‚Äî\\"something unprecedented in the country since its founding 50 years ago\\"‚Äîand ordered the creation of a high-level committee to \\"get fully prepared for the work of disintegrating [Falun Gong].\\" Rumors of an impending crackdown began circulating throughout China, prompting demonstrations and petitions. The government publicly denied the reports, calling them \\"completely baseless\\" and offering assurances that it had never banned qigong activities.Penny, The Religion of Falun Gong, p 63-66. Just after midnight on 20 July 1999, public security officers seized hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners from their homes in cities across China. Estimates on the number of arrests vary from several hundred to over 5,600. A Hong Kong newspaper reported that 50,000 individuals were detained in the first week of the crackdown. Four Falun Gong coordinators in Beijing were arrested and quickly tried on charges of \\"leaking state secrets\\".Noah Porter (Masters thesis for the University of South Florida), Falun Gong in the United States: An Ethnographic Study, 2003. The Public Security Bureau ordered churches, temples, mosques, newspapers, media, courts and police to suppress Falun Gong. Three days of massive demonstrations by practitioners in some thirty cities followed. In Beijing and other cities, protesters were detained in sports stadiums. Editorials in state-run newspapers urged people to give up Falun Gong practice, and Communist Party members in particular were reminded that they were atheists and must not allow themselves to \\"become superstitious by continuing to practice Falun Gong.\\" Li Hongzhi responded with a \\"Brief Statement of Mine\\" on 22 July: =Rationale= Falun Gong practitioners at Tiananmen Square appealing for an end to persecution Foreign observers have attempted to explain the Party's rationale for banning Falun Gong as stemming from a variety of factors. These include Falun Gong's popularity, its independence from the state and refusal to toe the Party line, internal power politics within the Communist Party, and Falun Gong's moral and spiritual content, which put it at odds with the Party's Marxist‚ÄìLeninist atheist ideology. A World Journal report suggested that certain high-level Party officials wanted to crack down on the practice for years, but lacked sufficient pretext until the protest at Zhongnanhai, which they claim was partly orchestrated by Luo Gan, a long-time opponent of Falun Gong.Julia Ching, \\"The Falun Gong: Religious and Political Implications,\\" American Asian Review, Vol. XIX, no. 4, Winter 2001, p 2 There were also reportedly rifts in the Politburo at the time of the incident. Willy Wo-Lap Lam writes that Jiang's campaign against Falun Gong may have been used to promote allegiance to himself; Lam quotes one party veteran as saying, \\"By unleashing a Mao-style movement [against Falun Gong], Jiang is forcing senior cadres to pledge allegiance to his line.\\"Willy Wo-Lap Lam, \\"China‚Äôs sect suppression carries a high price\\" CNN, 9 February 2001 Jiang is held by Falun Gong to be personally responsible for the final decision,Dean Peerman, China syndrome: the persecution of Falun Gong, Christian Century, 10 August 2004Tony Saich, Governance and Politics in China, Palgrave Macmillan; 2nd Ed edition (27 February 2004) and sources cited by The Washington Post state that, \\"Jiang Zemin alone decided that Falun Gong must be eliminated,\\" and \\"picked what he thought was an easy target.\\" Peerman cited reasons such as suspected personal jealousy of Li Hongzhi; Saich postulates that party leaders' anger at Falun Gong's widespread appeal, and ideological struggle. The Washington Post reported that members of the Politburo Standing Committee did not unanimously support the crackdown, and that \\"Jiang Zemin alone decided that Falun Gong must be eliminated.\\" The size and reach of Jiang's anti‚ÄìFalun Gong campaign surpassed that of many previous mass-movements.Willy Wo-Lap Lam, China‚Äôs sect suppression carries a high price, CNN.com, 9 February 2001. Human Rights Watch notes that the crackdown on Falun Gong reflects historical efforts by the Communist Party of China to eradicate religion, which the government believed was inherently subversive. Some journalists believe that Beijing's reaction exposes its authoritarian nature and its intolerance for competing loyalty. The Globe and Mail wrote : \\"...any group that does not come under the control of the Party is a threat\\"; secondly, the 1989 protests may have heightened the leaders' sense of losing their grip on power, making them live in \\"mortal fear\\" of popular demonstrations.Francesco Sisci, FALUNGONG Part 1: From sport to suicide Asia Times, 27 January 2001The Globe and Mail, Beijing v. falun gong, Metro A14, 26 January 2001 Craig Smith of the Wall Street Journal suggests that the government which has by definition no view of spirituality, lacks moral credibility with which to fight an expressly spiritual foe; the party feels increasingly threatened by any belief system that challenges its ideology and has an ability to organize itself. That Falun Gong, whose belief system represented a revival of traditional Chinese religion, was being practiced by many Communist Party members and members of the military was seen as particularly disturbing to Jiang Zemin. \\"Jiang accepts the threat of Falun Gong as an ideological one: spiritual beliefs against militant atheism and historical materialism. He [wished] to purge the government and the military of such beliefs\\".Julia Ching, \\"The Falun Gong: Religious and Political Implications,\\" American Asian Review, Vol. XIX, no. 4, Winter 2001, p. 12 Legal and political mechanisms=610 Office= 610 Office organization in China On 10 June the Party established the 610 Office, a Communist Party-led security agency responsible for coordinating the elimination of Falun Gong. The office was not created with any legislation, and there are no provisions describing its precise mandate. Because of this, it is sometimes described as an extralegal organization.Congressional Executive Commission on China 2011 Annual Report Nonetheless, its tasks were \\"to deal with central and local, party and state agencies, which were called upon to act in close coordination with that office,\\" according to UCLA professor James Tong. The leaders of the 610 Office are \\"able to call on top government and party officials...and draw on their institutional resources\\", and have personal access to the Communist Party General Secretary and the Premier.James Tong, Revenge of the Forbidden City. Oxford University Press, 2009 The office is headed by a high-ranking member of the Communist Party's Politburo or Politburo Standing Committee. It is closely associated with the powerful Political and Legislative Affairs Committee of the Communist Party of China. Soon after the creation of the central 610 Office, local branches were established at each administrative level wherever populations of Falun Gong practitioners were present, including the provincial, district, municipal, and sometimes neighborhood levels. In some instances, 610 Offices have been established within large corporations and universities. The main functions of the 610 Offices include coordinating anti‚ÄìFalun Gong propaganda, surveillance and intelligence collection, and the punishment and \\"reeducation\\" of Falun Gong practitioners.Congressional- Executive Commission on China (31 October 2008) ‚ÄòAnnual Report 2008‚Äô Retrieved 24 December 2013. The office is reportedly involved in the extrajudicial sentencing, coercive reeducation, torture, and sometimes death of Falun Gong practitioners. Journalist Ian Johnson, whose coverage of the crackdown on Falun Gong earned him a Pulitzer Prize, wrote that the job of the 610 Office was \\"to mobilize the country's pliant social organizations. Under orders from the Public Security Bureau, churches, temples, mosques, newspapers, media, courts and police all quickly lined up behind the government's simple plan: to crush Falun Gong, no measures too excessive.\\" =Official documents and circulars= Falun Gong books are destroyed following announcement of the ban in 1999. Beginning in July 1999 Chinese authorities issued a number of notices and circulars prescribing measures to crack down on the Falun Gong and placing restrictions on the practice and expression of religious belief: * On 22 July 1999, the Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a circular proclaiming that the Falun Dafa Research Society was an unregistered (and therefore illegal) organization. * On 22 July 1999 the Ministry of Public Security released a circular forbidding the practice or propagation of Falun Gong, as well as prohibiting any attempts to petition against the ban or oppose the government's decision. * In July 1999 the Ministry of Personnel issued a circular stating that all government employees were prohibited from practising Falun Gong. Subsequent documents instructed local government departments to \\"deal with civil servants who have practiced Falun Gong.\\" * On 26 July 1999 the Ministry of Public Security called for the confiscation and destruction of all publications related to Falun Gong. Falun Gong books were then shredded, burned and bulldozed for TV cameras.Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 ‚Äì 784 Millions of publications were destroyed‚Äîcrushed, shredded, or incinerated for TV cameras.People's Daily Online, China Bans Falun Gong, 30 July 1999 * On 29 July 1999 the Beijing Judicial Bureau issued a notice forbidding lawyers from defending Falun Gong practitioners. The Ministry of Justice also issued instructions that lawyers were not to represent Falun Gong without permission. * On 30 October 1999 the National People's Congress amended a statute (article 300 of the Criminal Code) to suppress \\"heterodox religions\\" across China.Dominson, Ian. \\"Criminal Law in the People's Republic of China (1997): Real Change or Rhetoric?\\" Pacific Rim Law & Policy Journal (2002), Vol 1 No. 11 The legislation was used to retroactively legitimize the persecution of spiritual groups deemed \\"dangerous to the state.\\" It prohibited any large-scale public assemblies, and also prohibited religious or qigong organizations from organizing themselves across multiple provinces or coordinating with groups overseas. The NPC decision stated \\"all corners of society shall be mobilized in preventing and fighting heretical organizations activities, and a comprehensive management system shall be put in place.\\" The same day, the Supreme People's Court issued a judicial interpretation prescribing measures to punish individuals found in defiance of the law. * On 5 November 1999 the Supreme People's Court issued a notice giving instructions to local courts on handling cases of people charged with crimes for \\"organising or using heretical organisations, particularly Falun Gong.\\" It called for Falun Gong practitioners to be prosecuted for such offenses as \\"instigating activities of splitting China, endangering national unity or subverting the socialist system.\\" Human rights experts and legal observers have stated that the official directives and legal documents issued for the purge fall short of international legal standards and violate provisions in China's own constitution.\\"The Persecution of Falun Gong is Illegal by China‚Äôs Law\\" clearwisdom.net 12 August 2009 =Implications for the rule of law= The Ministry of Justice required that lawyers seek permission before taking on Falun Gong cases, and called on them to \\"interpret the law in such a way as to conform to the spirit of the government's decrees.\\" Additionally, on 5 November 1999 the Supreme People's Court issued a notice to all lower courts stating that it was their \\"political duty\\" to \\"resolutely impose severe punishment\\" against groups considered heretical, especially Falun Gong. It also required the courts at all levels to handle Falun Gong cases by following the direction of the Communist Party committees, thereby ensuring that Falun Gong cases would be judged based on political considerations, rather than evidence. Brian Edelman and James Richardson wrote that the SPC notice \\"does not comport well with a defendant's constitutional right to a defense, and it appears to assume guilt before a trial has taken place.\\" The Communist Party's campaign against Falun Gong was a turning point in the development of China's legal system, representing a \\"significant backward step\\" in the development of rule of law, according to Ian Dominson. In the 1990s the legal system was gradually becoming more professionalized, and a series of reforms in 1996‚Äì97 affirmed the principle that all punishments must be based on the rule of law. However, the campaign against Falun Gong would not have been possible if carried out within the narrow confines of China's existing criminal law. In order to persecute the group, in 1999 the judicial system reverted to being used as a political instrument, with laws being applied flexibly to advance the Communist Party's policy objectives.Ronald C. Keith and Zhiqiu Lin, \\"The Falun Gong Problem,\\" China Quarterly (Sept 2003), pp 623‚Äì642. Edelman and Richardson write that \\"the Party and government's response to the Falun Gong movement violates citizens' right to a legal defense, freedom of religion, speech and assembly enshrined in the Constitution...the Party will do whatever is necessary to crush any perceived threat to its supreme control. This represents a move away from the rule of law and toward this historical Mao policy of 'rule by man.'\\" Propaganda=Onset of the campaign= This poster reads \\"Firmly support the decision of the Central Committee to deal with the illegal organization of Falun Gong\\". One of the key elements of the anti‚ÄìFalun Gong campaign was a propaganda campaign that sought to discredit and demonize Falun Gong and its teachings.James Tong, Revenge of the Forbidden City: The suppression of the Falungong in China, 1999‚Äì2005. (New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2009), Within the first month of the crackdown, 300‚Äì400 articles attacking Falun Gong appeared in the main state-run papers, while primetime television replayed alleged expos√©s on the group, with no divergent views aired in the media.Leeshai Lemish, \\"Media and New Religious Movements: The Case of Falun Gong\\" A paper presented at The 2009 CESNUR Conference, Salt Lake City, Utah, 11‚Äì13 June 2009 The propaganda campaign focused on allegations that Falun Gong jeopardized social stability, was deceiving and dangerous, was \\"anti-science\\" and threatened progress, and argued that Falun Gong's moral philosophy was incompatible with a Marxist social ethic. For several months China Central Television's evening news contained little but anti‚ÄìFalun Gong rhetoric. China scholars Daniel Wright and Joseph Fewsmith described it as \\"a study in all-out demonization\\", they wrote.Fewsmith, Joseph and Daniel B.

For example, the People's Daily newspaper asserted on 27 July 1999 that the fight against Falun Gong \\"was a struggle between theism and atheism, superstition and science, idealism and materialism.\\" Other editorials declared that Falun Gong's \\"idealism and theism\\" are \\"absolutely contradictory to the fundamental theories and principles of Marxism,\\" and that the \\"'truth, kindness and forbearance' principle preached by [Falun Gong] has nothing in common with the socialist ethical and cultural progress we are striving to achieve.\\"Gayle M.B.

At the early stages of the crackdown, the evening news also would broadcast images of large piles of Falun Gong materials being crushed or incinerated. By 30 July, ten days into the campaign, Xinhua had reported confiscations of over one million Falun Gong books and other materials, hundreds of thousands burned and destroyed. The tenor of the official rhetoric against Falun Gong continued to escalate in the months following July 1999, and broadened to include charges that Falun Gong was colluding with foreign \\"anti-China\\" forces. Media reports portrayed Falun Gong as a harm to society, an \\"abnormal\\" religious activity, and a dangerous form of \\"superstition\\" that led to madness, death, and suicide. These messages were relayed through all state-run‚Äîand many non-state-run media channels‚Äîas well as through work units and the Communist Party's own structure of cells that penetrate society. Elizabeth Perry, a Harvard historian, writes that the basic pattern of the offensive was similar to \\"the anti-rightist campaign of the 1950s [and] the anti-spiritual pollution campaigns of the 1980s.\\"Elizabeth J. Perry, Critical Asian Studies 33:2 (2001), p. 173 As it did during the Cultural Revolution, the Communist Party organised rallies in the streets and stop-work meetings in remote western provinces by government agencies such as the weather bureau to denounce the practice. Local government authorities have carried out \\"study and education\\" programmes throughout China, and official cadres have visited villagers and farmers at home to explain \\"in simple terms the harm of Falun Gong to them\\". =Use of the 'cult' label= Despite Party efforts, initial charges leveled against Falun Gong failed to elicit widespread popular support for the persecution of the group. In October 1999, three months after the persecution began, the Supreme People's Court issued a judicial interpretation classifying Falun Gong as a xiejiao.Irons, Edward. 2003 \\"Falun Gong and the Sectarian Religion Paradigm\\". Nova Religio, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp 243‚Äì62, ISSN 1092-6690Chan, Cheris Shun-ching (2004). The Falun Gong in China: A Sociological Perspective. The China Quarterly, 179 , pp 665‚Äì683 A broad translation of that term is \\"heretical teaching\\" or \\"heterodox teaching\\", but during the anti‚ÄìFalun Gong propaganda campaign it was rendered as \\"cult\\" or \\"evil cult\\" in English. In the context of imperial China, the term \\"xiejiao\\" was used to refer to non-Confucian religions, though in the context of Communist China, it has been used to target religious organizations that do not submit to the authority of the Communist Party.Maria Hsia Chang, \\"Falun Gong:The End of Days,\\" (Yale University Press, 2004).Freedom House, \\"Report Analyzing Seven Secret Chinese Government Documents\\", 11 February 2002. Julia Ching writes that the \\"evil cult\\" label was defined by an atheist government \\"on political premises, not by any religious authority\\", and was used by the authorities to make previous arrests and imprisonments constitutional. Ian Johnson argued that by applying the 'cult' label, the government put Falun Gong on the defensive, and \\"cloaked [its] crackdown with the legitimacy of the West's anticult movement.\\" David Ownby similarly wrote that \\"the entire issue of the supposed cultic nature of Falun Gong was a red herring from the beginning, cleverly exploited by the Chinese state to blunt the appeal of Falun Gong.\\". According to John Powers and Meg Y. M. Lee, because the Falun Gong was categorized in the popular perception as an \\"apolitical, qigong exercise club,\\" it was not seen as a threat to the government. The most critical strategy in the Falun Gong persecution campaign, therefore, was to convince people to reclassify the Falun Gong into a number of \\"negatively charged religious labels\\" like \\"evil cult\\", \\"sect\\", or \\"superstition\\".Powers, John and Meg Y. M. Lee. \\"Dueling Media: Symbolic Conflict in China's Falun Gong Suppression Campaign\\" in Chinese Conflict Management and Resolution, by Guo-Ming Chen and Ringo Ma (2001), Greenwood Publishing Group In this process of relabelling, the government was attempting to tap into a \\"deep reservoir of negative feelings related to the historical role of quasi-religious cults as a destabilising force in Chinese political history.\\" Overseas Chinese propaganda using this label has been censured by Western governments. The Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission in 2006 took issue with anti‚ÄìFalun Gong broadcasts from Chinese Central Television (CCTV), noting \\"they are expressions of extreme ill will against Falun Gong and its founder, Li Hongzhi. The derision, hostility and abuse encouraged by such comments could expose the targeted group or individual to hatred or contempt and...could incite violence and threaten the physical security of Falun Gong practitioners.\\"Canadian Radio-television Telecommunications Commission, \\"Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2006-166\\", paragraphs 95‚Äì107 =Tiananmen Square self-immolation incident= A turning point in the government's campaign against Falun Gong occurred on 23 January 2001, when five people set themselves on fire in Tiananmen Square. Chinese government sources declared immediately they were Falun Gong practitioners driven to suicide by the practice, and filled the nation's media outlets with graphic images and fresh denunciations of the practice. The self-immolation was held up as evidence of the \\"dangers\\" of Falun Gong, and was used to legitimize the government's crackdown against the group. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of the government's narrative, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide.\\"On Ten Year Anniversary, Tiananmen Square Self-Immolation Continues to Be Deadly Frame-up,\\" Falun Dafa Information Center, 19 January 2011 Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the official account of events, leading many to believe the self-immolation may have been staged to discredit Falun Gong. The government did not permit independent investigations and denied Western journalists or human rights groups access to the victims. However, two weeks after the self-immolation incident, The Washington Post published an investigation into the identity of two of the victims, and found that \\"no one ever saw [them] practice Falun Gong.\\" The campaign of state propaganda that followed the event eroded public sympathy for Falun Gong. As noted by Time magazine, many Chinese had previously felt that Falun Gong posed no real threat, and that the state's crackdown against it had gone too far. After the self-immolation, however, the media campaign against the group gained significant traction.Matthew Gornet, The Breaking Point, TIME, 25 June 2001 Posters, leaflets and videos were produced detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice, and regular anti‚ÄìFalun Gong classes were scheduled in schools. CNN compared the government's propaganda initiative to past political movements such as the Korean War and the Cultural Revolution. Later, as public opinion turned against the group, the Chinese authorities began sanctioning the \\"systematic use of violence\\" to eliminate Falun Gong. In the year following the incident, the imprisonment, torture, and deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in custody increased significantly.Sarah Cook, Sarah (4 November 2013) \\"Be Skeptical of the Official Story on the Tiananmen Car Crash\\" Freedom House. Censorship=Interference with foreign correspondents= The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China has complained about their members being \\"followed, detained, interrogated and threatened\\" for reporting on the crackdown on Falun Gong. Foreign journalists covering a clandestine Falun Gong news conference in October 1999 were accused by the Chinese authorities of \\"illegal reporting\\". Journalists from Reuters, the New York Times, the Associated Press and a number of other organisations were interrogated by police, forced to sign confessions, and had their work and residence papers temporarily confiscated. Correspondents also complained that television satellite transmissions were interfered with while being routed through China Central Television. Amnesty International states that \\"a number of people have received prison sentences or long terms of administrative detention for speaking out about the repression or giving information over the Internet.\\" The 2002 Reporters Without Borders' report on China states that photographers and cameramen working with foreign media were prevented from working in and around Tiananmen Square where hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners had been demonstrating in recent years. It estimates that \\"at least 50 representatives of the international press have been arrested since July 1999, and some of them were beaten by police; several Falun Gong followers have been imprisoned for talking with foreign journalists.\\" Ian Johnson, The Wall Street Journal correspondent in Beijing, wrote a series of articles which won him the 2001 Pulitzer Prize. Johnson left Beijing after writing his articles, stating that \\"the Chinese police would have made my life in Beijing impossible\\" after he received the Pulitzer.Reporters Without Borders. China annual report 2002, Retrieved 26 October 2014 Entire news organizations have not been immune to press restrictions concerning Falun Gong. In March 2001, Time Asia ran a story about Falun Gong in Hong Kong. The magazine was pulled from the shelves in Mainland China, and threatened that it would never again be sold in the country.Mark Landler. \\"China's Ban Of Magazine Clouds Forum In Hong Kong\\" New York Times, 6 May 2001 Partly as a result of the difficult reporting environment, by 2002, Western news coverage of the persecution within China had all but completely ceased, even as the number of Falun Gong deaths in custody was on the rise. =Internet censorship= Terms related to Falun Gong are among the most heavily censored topics on the Chinese Internet,Freedom House, \\"Freedom on the Net: China, 2012\\" and individuals found downloading or circulating information online about Falun Gong risk imprisonment. Chinese authorities began filtering and blocking overseas websites as early as the mid-1990s, and in 1998 the Ministry of Public Security developed plans for the \\"Golden Shield Project\\" to monitor and control online communications. The campaign against Falun Gong in 1999 provided authorities with added incentive to develop more rigorous censorship and surveillance techniques. The government also moved to criminalize various forms of online speech. China's first integrated regulation on Internet content, passed in 2000, made it illegal to disseminate information that \\"undermines social stability,\\" harms the \\"honor and interests of the state,\\" or that \\"undermines the state's policy for religions\\" or preaches \\"feudal\\" beliefs‚Äîa veiled reference to Falun Gong. The same year, the Chinese government sought out Western corporations to develop surveillance and censorship tools that would let them track Falun Gong practitioners and block access to news and information on the subject. North American companies such as Cisco and Nortel marketed their services to the Chinese government by touting their efficacy in catching Falun Gong. In addition to censoring the Internet within its borders, the Chinese government and military use cyber-warfare to attack Falun Gong websites in the United States, Australia, Canada and Europe.Morais, Richard C. \\"China's Fight With Falun Gong\\", Forbes, 9 February 2006. Retrieved 3 February 2015Associated Press, China Dissidents Thwarted on Net. Retrieved 19 September 2007 According to Chinese Internet researcher Ethan Gutmann, the first sustained denial of service attacks launched by China were against overseas Falun Gong websites.Ethan Gutmann, \\"Hacker Nation: China‚Äôs Cyber Assault,\\" World Affairs Journal, May/June 2010 In 2005, researchers from Harvard and Cambridge found that terms related to Falun Gong were the most intensively censored on the Chinese Internet.Zittrain and Palfrey (2005) Other studies of Chinese censorship and monitoring practices produced similar conclusions.Hartley, Matt. \\"How a Canadian cracked the great firewall of China\\". The Globe and Mail (3 Oct 2008) A 2012 study examining rates of censorship on Chinese social media websites found Falun Gong-related terms were among the most stringently censored. Among the top 20 terms most likely to be deleted on Chinese social media websites, three are variations on the word \\"Falun Gong\\" or \\"Falun Dafa\\".David Bamman, Brendan O'Connor, Noah A. Smith Censorship and deletion practices in Chinese social media firstmonday.org Volume 17, Number 3‚Äì5 March 2012 In response to censorship of the Chinese Internet, Falun Gong practitioners in North America developed a suite of software tools that could be used by bypass online censorship and surveillance. Torture and extrajudicial killing=Reeducation= A key component of the Communist Party's campaign is the reeducation or \\"transformation\\" of Falun Gong practitioners. Transformation is described as \\"a process of ideological reprogramming whereby practitioners are subjected to various methods of physical and psychological coercion until they recant their belief in Falun Gong.\\" The transformation process usually occurs in prisons, labor camps, reeducation centers and other detention facilities. In 2001 Chinese authorities ordered that no Falun Gong practitioner was to be spared from the coercive measures used to make them renounce their faith. The most active were sent directly to labor camps, \\"where they are first 'broken' by beatings and other torture.\\" Former prisoners report being told by the guards that \\"no measures are too excessive\\" to elicit renunciation statements, and practitioners who refuse to renounce Falun Gong are sometimes killed in custody.Ian Johnson, \\"A Deadly Exercise: Practicing Falun Gong was a right, Chen said, to her last day\\", Wall Street Journal, 20 April 2000 The transformation is considered successful once the Falun Gong practitioner signs five documents: a \\"guarantee\\" to stop practicing Falun Gong; a promise to sever all ties to the practice; two self-criticism documents critiquing their own behaviour and thinking; and criticisms of Falun Gong doctrine. In order to demonstrate the sincerity of their renunciations, practitioners are made to vilify Falun Gong in front of an audience or on videotape. These recordings may then be used by state-run media as part of a propaganda effort. In some camps the newly reeducated must partake in the transformation of other practitioners‚Äîincluding by inflicting physical abuse on others‚Äîas proof that they have fully renounced Falun Gong's teachings. An account of the transformation process was published by The Washington Post in 2001: The transformation efforts are driven by incentives and directives issued from central Communist Party authorities via the 610 Office. Local governments and officials in charge of detention facilities are given quotas stipulating how many Falun Gong practitioners must be successfully transformed. Fulfillment of these quotas is tied to promotions and financial compensation, with \\"generous bonuses\\" going to officials who meet the targets set by the government, and possible demotions for those who do not. The central 610 Office periodically launches new transformation campaigns to revise the quotas and disseminate new methods. In 2010, it initiated a nationwide, three-year campaign to transform large numbers of Falun Gong practitioners. Documents posted on Party and local government websites refer to concrete transformation targets and set limits on acceptable rates of \\"relapse.\\" Congressional Executive Commission in China (22 March 2011) \\"Communist Party Calls for Increased Efforts To \\"Transform\\" Falun Gong Practitioners as Part of Three-Year Campaign\\" A similar three-year campaign was launched in 2013. =Torture and abuse in custody= In order to reach transformation targets, the government sanctioned the systematic use of torture and violence against Falun Gong practitioners, including shocks with electric truncheons and beatings. Amnesty International writes that \\"detainees who do not cooperate with the 're-education' process will be subjected to methods of torture and other ill-treatment ‚Ä¶ with increasing severity.\\" The \\"soft\\" methods include sleep deprivation, threatening family members, and denial of access to sanitation or bathrooms. The ill-treatment escalates to beatings, 24-hour surveillance, solitary confinement, shocks with electric batons, abusive forced feedings, \\"rack\\" torture and the \\"tiger bench,\\" wherein the person is bound to a board and their legs are made to bend backwards. Since 2000, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture documented 314 cases of torture in China, representing more than 1,160 individuals. Falun Gong comprised 66% of the reported torture cases. The Special Rapporteur referred to the torture allegations as \\"harrowing\\" and asked the Chinese government to \\"take immediate steps to protect the lives and integrity of its detainees in accordance with the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners\\".Asma Jahangir (22 December 2003), \\"Civil and Political Rights, Including the Question of Disappearances and Summary Executions\\", Report of the Special Rapporteur, United Nations. Retrieved 28 January 2015 Numerous forms of torture are purported to be used, including electric shocks, suspension by the arms, shackling in painful positions, sleep and food deprivation, force-feeding, and sexual abuse, with many variations on each type. =Extrajudicial killing= Gao Rongrong, a Falun Gong practitioner from Liaoning province, was tortured in custody in 2005. The Falun Dafa Information Center reports that over 3,700 named Falun Gong practitioners have died as a result of torture and abuse in custody, typically after they refused to recant their beliefs. Amnesty International notes that this figure may be \\"only a small portion of the actual number of deaths in custody, as many families do not seek legal redress for these deaths or systematically inform overseas sources.\\" Among the first torture deaths reported in the Western press was that of Chen Zixiu, a retired factory worker from Shandong Province. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning article on the persecution of Falun Gong, Ian Johnson reported that labor camp guards shocked her with cattle prods in an attempt to force her to renounce Falun Gong. When she refused, \\"[Officials] ordered Chen to run barefoot in the snow. Two days of torture had left her legs bruised and her short black hair matted with pus and blood...She crawled outside, vomited, and collapsed. She never regained consciousness.\\" Chen died on 21 February 2000.

A significant increase in the number of annual organ transplants in China beginning in 1999, corresponded with the onset of the persecution of Falun Gong. Despite very low levels of voluntary organ donation, China performs the second-highest number of transplants per year. Kilgour and Matas also presented incriminating material from Chinese transplant center web sites advertising the immediate availability of organs from living donors, as well as transcripts of telephone interviews in which hospitals told prospective transplant recipients that they could obtain Falun Gong organs. An updated version of their report was published as a book in 2009. Kilgour followed up on this investigation in a 680-page 2016 report. Ethan Gutmann (left) with Edward McMillan-Scott at a 2009 Foreign Press Association press conference In 2014, investigative journalist Ethan Gutmann published the results of his own investigation. Gutmann conducted extensive interviews with former detainees in Chinese labor camps and prisons, as well as former security officers and medical professionals with knowledge of China's transplant practices.Jay Nordlinger (25 August 2014) \\"Face The Slaughter: The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China‚Äôs Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem, by Ethan Gutmann\\", National ReviewBarbara Turnbull (21 October 2014) \\"Q&A;: Author and analyst Ethan Gutmann discusses China‚Äôs illegal organ trade\\", The Toronto Star He reported that organ harvesting from political prisoners likely began in Xinjiang province in the 1990s, and then spread nationwide. Gutmann estimates that some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008. In 2016, the researchers published a joint update to their findings showing that the number of organ transplants conducted in China is much higher than previously believed, and that the death from illicit organ harvesting could be as high as 1,500,000. The 789-page report is based on an analysis of records from hundreds of Chinese transplant hospitals. In December 2005 and November 2006, China's Deputy Health Minister acknowledged that the practice of removing organs from executed prisoners for transplants was widespread.\\"China to ‚Äòtidy up‚Äô trade in executed prisoners‚Äô organs\\", The Times, 3 December 2005\\"Death Row Is Organ Source, China Admits\\", Los Angeles Times, 18 November 2006 However, Chinese officials deny that Falun Gong practitioners' organs are being harvested, and insist that China abides by World Health Organization principles that prohibit the sale of human organs without written consent from donors.Chinese Embassy in Canada (6 July 2006) Response to the so called \\"China's organ harvesting report\\", ca.china- embassy.orgChinese Embassy in Canada (15 April 2007) Response to the so-called \\"Revised Report on China's Organ Harvesting\\", ca.china-embassy.org In May 2008, two United Nations Special Rapporteurs reiterated their requests for the Chinese authorities to adequately respond to the allegations, and to provide a source for the organs that would account for the sudden increase in organ transplants in China since 2000. In June 2019, an independent tribunal sitting in London named the China Tribunal, established to inquire into forced organ harvesting from and among prisoners of conscience in China, stated that the members of the Falun Gong spiritual group continued to be murdered by China for their organs. The tribunal said it had clear evidence that forced organ harvesting has been taking place in China from over at least 20 years. China has repeatedly denied the accusations, claiming to have stopped using organs from executed prisoners in 2015. However, the lawyers and experts at the China Tribunal are convinced that the practice was still taking place with the imprisoned Falun Gong members \\"probably the principal source\\" of organs for forced harvesting. Arbitrary arrests and imprisonment Foreign observers estimate that hundreds of thousands‚Äîand perhaps millions‚Äîof Falun Gong practitioners have been held extralegally in reeducation-through-labor camps, prisons, and other detention facilities.Leeshai Lemish (7 October 2008) \\"How China is Silencing Falun Gong\\", National Post david-kilgour.com Large-scale arrests are conducted periodically and often coincide with important anniversaries or major events. The first wave of arrests occurred on the evening of 20 July, when several thousand practitioners were taken from their homes into police custody.Tong (2009) In November 1999‚Äîfour months after the onset of the campaign‚ÄîVice Premier Li Lanqing announced that 35,000 Falun Gong practitioners had been arrested or detained. The Washington Post wrote that \\"the number of detained people...in the operation against Falun Gong dwarfs every political campaign in recent years in China.\\" By April 2000 over 30,000 people had been arrested for protesting in defense of Falun Gong in Tiananmen Square. Seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the Square on 1 January 2001. In advance of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing over 8,000 Falun Gong practitioners were taken from their homes and workplaces in provinces across China. Two years later authorities in Shanghai detained over 100 practitioners ahead of the 2010 World Expo. Those who refused to disavow Falun Gong were subjected to torture and sent to reeducation through labor facilities. =Reeducation through labor= From 1999 to 2013, the vast majority of detained Falun Gong practitioners were held in reeducation through labor (RTL) camps‚Äîa system of administrative detention where people can be imprisoned without trial for up to four years.Robert Bejesky, \\"Falun Gong & reeducation through labour\\", Columbia Journal of Asian Law, 17:2, Spring 2004, p 178. Quote: \\"Up to 99% of long term Falun Gong detainees are processed administratively through this system, and do not enter the formal criminal justice system\\" The RTL system was established during the Maoist era to punish and reprogram \\"reactionaries\\" and other individuals deemed enemies of the Communist cause. In more recent years, it has been used to incarcerate petty criminals, drug addicts and prostitutes, as well as petitioners and dissidents. RTL sentences can be arbitrarily extended by police, and outside access is not permitted. Prisoners are forced to do heavy work in mines, brick manufacturing centers, agricultural fields, and many different types of factories. Physical torture, beatings, interrogations, and other human rights abuses take place in the camps, according to former prisoners and human rights organizations. China's network of RTL centers expanded significantly after 1999 to accommodate an influx of Falun Gong detainees, and authorities used the camps to try to \\"transform\\" Falun Gong practitioners. Amnesty International reports that \\"The RTL system has played a key role in the anti‚ÄìFalun Gong campaign, absorbing large numbers of practitioners over the years... Evidence suggests that Falun Gong constituted on average from one third to, in some cases, 100 percent of the total population of certain RTL camps.\\" International observers estimated that Falun Gong practitioners accounted for at least half of the total RTL population, amounting to several hundred thousand people. A 2005 report by Human Rights Watch found that Falun Gong practitioners made up the majority of the detainee population in the camps studied, and received the \\"longest sentences and worst treatment.\\" \\"The government's campaign against the group has been so thorough that even long-time Chinese activists are afraid to say the group's name aloud.\\" In 2012 and early 2013, a series of news reports and expos√©s focused attention on human rights abuses at the Masanjia Forced Labor Camp, where approximately half of the inmates were Falun Gong practitioners. The exposure helped galvanize calls to end the reeducation-through-labor system. In early 2013, CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping announced that RTL would be abolished, resulting in the closure of the camps. However, human rights groups found that many RTL facilities have simply been renamed as prisons or rehabilitation centers, and that the use of extrajudicial imprisonment of dissidents and Falun Gong practitioners has continued. The system is often called Laogai, the abbreviation for l√°od√≤ng g«éiz√†o (), which means \\"reform through labor,\\" and is a slogan of the Chinese criminal justice system. =Black jails and re- education centers= In addition to prisons and RTL facilities, the 610 Office created a nationwide network of extrajudicial reeducation centers to \\"transform the minds\\" of Falun Gong practitioners.US Department of State, International Religious Freedom Report 2007, 14 September 2007. Retrieved 28 September 2007 The centers are run extrajudicially, and the government officially denies their existence.

Others are permanent facilities that operate as private jails.Human Rights in China, Êó∑Êó•ÊåÅ‰πÖÁöÑÊÅêÊÄñËø´ÂÆ≥ If a Falun Gong practitioner refuses to be \\"transformed\\" in prison or RTL camps, they can be sent directly to transformation centers upon completion of their sentence. The Congressional-Executive Commission on China writes that the facilities \\"are used specifically to detain Falun Gong practitioners who have completed terms in reeducation through labor (RTL) camps but whom authorities refuse to release.\\" Practitioners who are involuntarily detained in the transformation centers must pay tuition fees amounting to hundreds of dollars. The fees are extorted from family members as well as from practitioners' work units and employers. The government's use of \\"brainwashing sessions\\" began in 1999, but the network of transformation centers expanded nationwide in January 2001 when the central 610 Office mandated that all government bodies, work units, and corporations use them. The Washington Post reported \\"neighborhood officials have compelled even the elderly, people with disabilities and the ill to attend the classes. Universities have sent staff to find students who had dropped out or been expelled for practicing Falun Gong, and brought them back for the sessions. Other members have been forced to leave sick relatives\\" to attend the reeducation sessions. After the closure of the RTL system in 2013, authorities leaned more heavily on the transformation centers to detain Falun Gong practitioners. After the Nanchong RTL center in Sichuan province was closed, for example, at least a dozen of the Falun Gong practitioners detained there were sent directly to a local transformation center. Some former RTL camps have simply been renamed and converted into transformation centers. =Psychiatric abuse= Falun Gong practitioners who refuse to recant their beliefs are sometimes sent involuntarily to psychiatric hospitals, where they may be subject to beatings, sleep deprivation, torture by electrocution, and injections with sedatives or anti-psychotic drugs. Some are sent to the hospitals (known as ankang facilities) because their prison or RTL sentences have expired and they had not yet been successfully \\"transformed\\" in the brainwashing classes. Others were told that they were admitted because they had a \\"political problem\\"‚Äîthat is, because they appealed to the government to lift the ban of Falun Gong. \\"Psychiatric Abuse of Falun Gong Practitioners in China\\", Sunny Y.

In 2001, Munro alleged that forensic psychiatrists in China have been active since the days of Mao Zedong, and have been involved in the systematic misuse of psychiatry for political purposes. He says that large- scale psychiatric abuses are the most distinctive aspect of the government's protracted campaign to \\"crush the Falun Gong,\\"Munro (2002), p. 270 and he found a very sizable increase in Falun Gong admissions to mental hospitals since the onset of the government's persecution campaign. Munro claimed that detained Falun Gong practitioners are tortured and subject to electroconvulsive therapy, painful forms of electrical acupuncture treatment, prolonged deprivation of light, food and water, and restricted access to toilet facilities in order to force \\"confessions\\" or \\"renunciations\\" as a condition of release. Fines of several thousand yuan may follow.Munro (2002), p. 107 Lu and Galli write that dosages of medication up to five or six times the usual level are administered through a nasogastric tube as a form of torture or punishment, and that physical torture is common, including binding tightly with ropes in very painful positions. This treatment may result in chemical toxicity, migraines, extreme weakness, protrusion of the tongue, rigidity, loss of consciousness, vomiting, nausea, seizures and loss of memory. Dr. Alan Stone, a professor of law and psychiatry at Harvard, found that a significant number of the Falun Gong practitioners held in psychiatric hospitals had been sent there from labor camps, writing \\"[They] may well have been tortured and then dumped in psychiatric hospitals as an expedient disposition.\\" He agreed that Falun Gong practitioners sent to psychiatric hospitals had been \\"misdiagnosed and mistreated\\", but did not find definitive evidence that the use of psychiatric facilities was part of a uniform government policy, noting instead that patterns of institutionalization varied from province to province.Stone, Alan A. (1 May 2005). \\"The China Psychiatry Crisis: Following Up on the Plight of the Falun Gong: Page 2 of 3\\" . Rheumatology Network. =Prisons= Since 1999, several thousand Falun Gong practitioners have been sentenced to prisons through the criminal justice system. Most of the charges against Falun Gong practitioners are for political offenses such as \\"disturbing social order,\\" \\"leaking state secrets,\\" \\"subverting the socialist system,\\" or \\"using a heretical organization to undermine the implementation of the law\\"‚Äîa vaguely worded provision used to prosecute, for instance, individuals who used the Internet to disseminate information about Falun Gong.Robert Bejesky, \\"Falun Gong & reeducation through labour\\", Columbia Journal of Asian Law, 17:2, Spring 2004, pp. 147‚Äì189 According to a report by Amnesty International, trials against Falun Gong practitioners are \\"Grossly unfair ‚Äì the judicial process was biased against the defendants at the outset and the trials were a mere formality...None of the accusations against the defendants relate to activities which would legitimately be regarded as crimes under international standards.\\" Chinese human rights lawyers who have attempted to defend Falun Gong clients have faced varying degrees of persecution themselves, including disbarment, detention, and in some cases, torture and disappearance.Amnesty International (7 September 2009) \\"Breaking the law: Crackdown on human rights lawyers and legal activists in China\\" Societal discrimination Since July 1999, civil servants and Communist Party members have been forbidden from practicing Falun Gong. Workplaces and schools were enjoined to participate in the struggle against Falun Gong by pressuring recalcitrant Falun Gong believers to renounce their beliefs, sometimes sending them to special reeducation classes to be \\"transformed\\". Failure to do so has results in lost wages, pensions, expulsion, or termination from jobs. Writing in 2015, Noakes and Ford noted that \\"Post-secondary institutions across the country ‚Äì from agricultural universities to law schools to fine arts programmes ‚Äì require students to prove that they have adopted the \\"correct attitude\\" on Falun Gong as a condition of admission.\\" For example, students at many universities are required to obtain a certificate from the public security ministry certifying that they have no affiliation with Falun Gong. The same is true in employment, with job postings frequently specifying that prospective candidates must have no record of participation in Falun Gong. In some cases, even changing one's address requires proving the correct political attitude toward Falun Gong. Outside China The Communist Party's campaign against Falun Gong has extended to diaspora communities, including through the use of media, espionage and monitoring of Falun Gong practitioners, harassment and violence against practitioners, diplomatic pressure applied to foreign governments, and hacking of overseas websites. According to a defector from the Chinese consulate in Sydney, Australia, \\"The war against Falun Gong is one of the main tasks of the Chinese mission overseas.\\"Alex Newman, ‚ÄòChina‚Äôs Growing Spy Threat‚Äô, The Diplomat, 19 September 2011. In 2004 the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a resolution condemning the attacks on Falun Gong practitioners in the United States by agents of the Communist Party. The resolution reported that party affiliates have \\"pressured local elected officials in the United States to refuse or withdraw support for the Falun Gong spiritual group,\\" that Falun Gong spokespeople have had their houses broken into, and individuals engaged in peaceful protest actions outside embassies and consulates have been physically assaulted.United States House of Representatives, House Concurrent Resolution 304, Expressing sense of congress regarding oppression by the government of the People‚Äôs Republic of China of Falun Gong in the United States and in China, 16 October 2003. The overseas campaign against Falun Gong is described in documents issued by China's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO). In a report from a 2007 meeting of OCAO directors at the national, provincial, and municipal level, the office stated that it \\"coordinates the launching of anti-'Falun Gong' struggles overseas.\\" OCAO exhorts overseas Chinese citizens to participate in \\"resolutely implementing and executing the Party line, the Party's guiding principles, and the Party's policies,\\" and to \\"aggressively expand the struggle\\" against Falun Gong, ethnic separatists, and Taiwanese independence activists abroad.

International response The persecution of Falun Gong has attracted a large amount of international attention from governments and non-government organizations. Human rights organizations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have raised acute concerns over reports of torture and ill-treatment of practitioners in China and have also urged the UN and international governments to intervene to bring an end to the persecution.Human Rights Watch China's Campaign Against Falungong 2002 The United States Congress has passed multiple resolutions ‚Äì House Concurrent Resolution 304, House Resolution 530,House Concurrent Resolution 188, House Concurrent Resolution 218, ‚Äì calling for an immediate end to the campaign against Falun Gong practitioners both in China and abroad. At a rally on 12 July 2012, U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, called on the Obama Administration to confront the Chinese leadership on its human rights record, including its oppression of Falun Gong practitioners.Ros-Lehtinen China's abuse of Falun Gong Practitioners Worsening House Committee on Foreign Affairs \\"It is essential that friends and supporters of democracy and human rights continue to show their solidarity and support, by speaking out against these abuses\\", she said. In 2012, Professor of Bioethics Arthur Caplan stated, > Look, I think you can make the connections that...they are using prisoners, > and they need prisoners who are relatively healthy, they need prisoners who > are relatively younger. It doesn't take a great stretch of the imagination > that some Falun Gong [practitioners] are going to be among those who are > going to be killed for parts. It just follows, because remember you can't > take very old people as sources of organs and you can't take people who are > very sick. They, Falun Gong, are in part younger, and by lifestyle, > healthier. I would be astounded if they weren't using some of those > prisoners as sources of organs.\\"Chinese Regime Indirectly Admits Organ > Harvesting: Bioethics Professor\\", Youtube video, NTDTV, 15 Mar 2012 In 2008 Israel passed a law banning the sale and brokerage of organs. The law also ended funding, through the health insurance system, of transplants in China for Israeli nationals.Jotkowitz A \\"Notes on the new Israeli organ donation law-2008\\" National Institutes of Health, December 2008. Response from Falun Gong practitioners Falun Gong's response to the persecution in China began in July 1999 with appeals to local, provincial, and central petitioning offices in Beijing.Elisabeth Rosenthal and Erik Eckholm \\"Vast Numbers of Sect Members Keep Pressure on Beijing\\" New York Times, 28 October 1999. It soon progressed to larger demonstrations, with hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners traveling daily to Tiananmen Square to perform Falun Gong exercises or raise banners in defense of the practice. These demonstrations were invariably broken up by security forces, and the practitioners involved were arrested‚Äîsometimes violently‚Äîand detained. By 25 April 2000, a total of more than 30,000 practitioners had been arrested on the square; seven hundred Falun Gong followers were arrested during a demonstration in the square on 1 January 2001. Public protests continued well into 2001. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Ian Johnson wrote that \\"Falun Gong faithful have mustered what is arguably the most sustained challenge to authority in 50 years of Communist rule.\\" By late 2001, demonstrations in Tiananmen Square had become less frequent, and the practice was driven deeper underground. As public protest fell out of favor, practitioners established underground \\"material sites\\", which would produce literature and DVDs to counter the portrayal of Falun Gong in the official media. Practitioners then distribute these materials, often door-to-door.Liao Yiwu. The Corpse Walker: Real Life Stories: China from the Bottom Up. p. 230. The production, possession, or distribution of these materials is frequently grounds for security agents to incarcerate or sentence Falun Gong adherents. In 2002, Falun Gong activists in China tapped into television broadcasts, replacing regular state-run programming with their own content. One of the more notable instances occurred in March 2002, when Falun Gong practitioners in Changchun intercepted eight cable television networks in Jilin Province, and for nearly an hour, televised a program titled Self- Immolation or a Staged Act?. All six of the Falun Gong practitioners involved were captured over the next few months. Two were killed immediately, while the other four were all dead by 2010 as a result of injuries sustained while imprisoned. Outside China, Falun Gong practitioners established international media organizations to gain wider exposure for their cause and challenge narratives of the Chinese state-run media. These include the Epoch Times newspaper, New Tang Dynasty Television, and Sound of Hope radio station. According to Zhao, through the Epoch Times it can be discerned how Falun Gong is building a \\"de facto media alliance\\" with China's democracy movements in exile, as demonstrated by its frequent printing of articles by prominent overseas Chinese critics of the PRC government.Yuezhi Zhao, \\"Falun Gong, Identity, and the Struggle over Meaning Inside and Outside China\\", in Contesting Media Power, 2004 In 2004, the Epoch Times published \\"The Nine Commentaries\\", a collection of nine editorials which presented a critical history of Communist Party rule.Hu Ping, \\"The Falun Gong Phenomenon\\", in Challenging China: Struggle and Hope in an Era of Change, Sharon Hom and Stacy Mosher (ed.) (New York: The New Press, 2007).Steel, Kevin. \\"Revolution number nine\\", The Western Standard, 11 July 2005. This catalyzed the Tuidang movement, which encourages Chinese citizens to renounce their affiliations to the Communist Party of China, including ex post facto renunciations of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers. The Epoch Times claims that tens of millions have renounced the Communist Party as part of the movement, though these numbers have not been independently verified.Gutmann, Ethan. The Chinese Internet: A dream deferred?. Testimony given at the National Endowment for Democracy panel discussion \\"Tiananmen 20 years on\\", 2 June 2009. In 2007, Falun Gong practitioners in the United States formed Shen Yun Performing Arts, a dance and music company that tours internationally. Falun Gong software developers in the United States are also responsible for the creation of several popular censorship-circumvention tools employed by internet users in China.Beiser, Vince. \\"Digital Weapons Help Dissidents Punch Holes in China's Great Firewall\\".

Falun Gong Practitioners outside China have filed dozens of lawsuits against Jiang Zemin, Luo Gan, Bo Xilai, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity.Human Rights Law Foundation, Direct Litigation. Retrieved 26 October 2014 According to International Advocates for Justice, Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges are among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. , 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries. In many instances, courts have refused to adjudicate the cases on the grounds of sovereign immunity. In late 2009, however, separate courts in Spain and Argentina indicted Jiang Zemin and Luo Gan on charges of \\"crimes of humanity\\" and genocide, and asked for their arrest‚Äîthe ruling is acknowledged to be largely symbolic and unlikely to be carried out.NTDTV (7 Dec 2009) \\"Jiang Zemin indicted in Spain for genocide and torture of Falun Gong practitioners\\", International Federation for Justice in ChinaLuis Andres Henao, \\"Argentine judge asks China arrests over Falun Gong\\", Reuters, 22 December 2009 The court in Spain also indicted Bo Xilai, Jia Qinglin and Wu Guanzheng. Falun Gong practitioners and their supporters also filed a lawsuit in May 2011 against the technology company Cisco Systems, alleging that the company helped design and implement a surveillance system for the Chinese government to suppress Falun Gong. Cisco denied customizing their technology for this purpose.Terry Baynes, \\"Suit claims Cisco helped China repress religious group\\", Reuters, 20 May 2011.

The Danish king had demanded that the Red Cross investigate reports that its deported Jewish citizens were being murdered. The Germans stalled before agreeing to permit the visit; they wanted to ensure the continued cooperation of Danish subjects working in war production factories, as they still occupied Denmark and had pressed many residents into labor. Shortly before the visit, the Nazis deported 7,503 people to the Auschwitz concentration camp to eliminate overcrowding. Theresienstadt was cleaned up and staged as a model community. The Red Cross visitors saw newly planted flower gardens and freshly painted houses. By 1944, the visit to Theresienstadt was only one piece of an accumulating body of information on The Holocaust which the Red Cross learned. Historians consider it significant that the Red Cross' 15-page report on Theresienstadt failed to raise the question of whether mass murder was taking place in Nazi-occupied Europe.The Red Cross and the Holocaust, Jean-Claude Favez, Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 45.

She represented the South Africa women's national football team at the 2012 London Olympics. She became the first African player to score 100 international goals. Club career Modise was born in Soweto (Meadowlands) and started playing football with the boys in her neighbourhood. She chose football ahead of netball at school, and began playing with Soweto Rangers at under‚Äì10 level. After playing for Rangers and the women's section of Jomo Cosmos, Modise moved to Soweto Ladies in 1996. She has two brothers. Comfortable in either a midfield or forward role, Modise was nicknamed \\"Bashin\\" after the male footballer Albert \\"Bashin\\" Mahlangu. In the 2001‚Äì02 regular season, Modise scored 51 goals for Soweto Ladies, adding two more in the 4‚Äì0 National Championship final win over Cape Town Pirates. In 2003 Modise was invited to trials with Arsenal Ladies. A dispute over sponsorship and funding left Modise and compatriots Toni Carelse and Veronica Phewa unable to sign for the English club despite impressing manager Vic Akers during the trials. In 2005‚Äì06 Modise was employed by Orlando Pirates as an academy coach. She left after seven months in February 2006 following a disagreement with her boss Augusto Palacios. In June 2007 Modise signed a two-year deal with Fortuna Hj√∏rring in Denmark's Elitedivisionen, after impressing during an initial one- month contract. In South Africa she represented Orlando Pirates, Jomo Cosmos F.C. and Palace Super Falcons. In 2009, she signed a six-month contract at Palace Super Falcons in South Africa. In 2012, she also played there. She wasn't part of the initial training camp for the 2014 African Women's Championship squad, because she was playing 'under the radar' outside of South Africa, in deed for a men's team. After the new coach was made aware of her, she switched clubs and played for Croesus Ladies back in South Africa. National team career Modise was captain of the South Africa under‚Äì19 national team (Basetsane Basetsane) when she was called into the senior squad (Banyana Banyana). In the 2000 Women's African Football Championship, she featured in all South Africa's games, scoring her first goal against Zimbabwe as well as playing in the tournament final, a defeat to Nigeria which was marred by crowd violence. In 2005, Modise was one of two African footballers, alongside Perpetua Nkwocha, to be nominated for the Women's FIFA World Player of the Year, which was won by Birgit Prinz. At the 2006 Women's African Football Championship, she scored a goal in the third place final playing for South Africa against Cameroon, and was named Player of the Championship. She was also voted in the top three for the 2006 CAF Women's Footballer of the Year award, and was selected to play for the All-Stars squad in the match preceding the official draw for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. In November 2008 Modise announced she would no longer play for South Africa, after a breakdown in her working relationship with coach August Makalakalane. She was recalled in April 2012 by new national coach Joseph Mkhonza, after Makalakalane had been sacked amidst allegations of sexual harassment and homophobia. Modise had 71 goals in 92 international caps heading into the 2012 Olympic football tournament. In South Africa's first match at the games, a 4‚Äì1 defeat to Sweden in Coventry, Modise scored a goal from inside the centre circle. FIFA.com reported that the \\"stunning\\" goal was acclaimed by the entire stadium, including the Swedish supporters. October 2012 saw Modise named in the South African squad for the 2012 African Women's Championship. It was reported that she could reach her milestone 100th appearance during the tournament, should Banyana Banyana reach the semi-finals. Modise played a key role in South Africa's run to the final, where they were beaten by Equatorial Guinea. In October 2014 Portia Modise became the first African player to reach the elusive 100-goal barrier in international football, when she scored her 99th and 100th goal in South Africa's 5‚Äì1 victory against Algeria at the CAF African Women's Championship.https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/women/news/newsid=2458848/ On 19 May 2015, she announced her retirement from international football, after playing 124 matches and scoring 101 goals for South Africa.

As captain of the national team Modise publicly rejected the proposals and made an outspoken attack on the committee: \\"We need sponsors but all the committee does is raise less important issues because they have failed to transform the sport.\\" During the dispute with Ledwaba, Modise had declined to reveal her own sexual orientation: \\"My private life is my business.\\" In 2011, she appeared in a television documentary which highlighted the plight of lesbians in South Africa, who live in fear of \\"corrective rape\\", violence and murder. Modise told the programme makers she did not venture out alone at night: \\"I know how dangerous it is to live as a black lesbian in South Africa.\\" See also *List of women's association football players with 100 or more international goals ReferencesExternal links South Africa player profile 1983 births Living people Sportspeople from Soweto South African women's soccer players South Africa women's international soccer players Expatriate footballers in Denmark South African expatriate sportspeople in Denmark Fortuna Hj√∏rring players Footballers at the 2012 Summer Olympics Olympic soccer players of South Africa South African expatriate soccer players LGBT sportspeople from South Africa Lesbian sportswomen LGBT association football players FIFA Century Club Women's association football midfielders Women's association football forwards ","title":"Portia Modise"},{"id":"23789980","text":"Cristina is a 1946 Argentine comedy-drama film directed by Francisco M√∫gica and starring Zully Moreno, Esteban Serrador and Alberto Closas.

History=Campbell ownership 1709‚Äì1842= The lands were originally part of the extensive estates of the Campbell of Breadalbane,http://www.barcaldinecastle.co.uk/about/ who had built Barcaldine Castle in about 1594, one of six castles including Kilchurn, Edinample and Taymouth Castle. At that time the lands extended from Loch Tay continuously to the west coast of Scotland. The house was originally built in 1709, by \\"Red Patrick\\", 4th (laird) of Barcaldine when the family abandoned the nearby Barcaldine Castle for a more comfortable home. The house became the home of his son by his first marriage, Duncan Campbell (1716‚Äì1784). Duncan's half brother (by Red Patrick's second wife) was Colin Campbell of Glenure, the Red Fox in RL Stevenson's Kidnapped, who was assassinated in the woods at Lettermore near Duror on 14 May 1752. The question of who shot the Red Fox has become known as the Appin Mystery. The body of the Red Fox rested in the Drawing Room of Barcaldine House on the way to its burial site at Ardchattan Priory.http://www.barcaldinecastle.co.uk/about/ Barcaldine House was extended by Duncan Campbell, 1st Baronet (1786‚Äì1842), the great grandson of Red Patrick. Duncan received his baronetcy in 1831 for service in the army during the Napoleonic wars. Campbell laid out the high walled garden which is now the nearby caravan park. The garden had huge heated glasshouses with vines, peaches, pineapples, nectarines and other exotic fruits. Some trees from that time still survive. The estate was sold in 1842 to clear family debts. =Decline 1842‚Äì1988= The estate was purchased by Donald Charles Cameron in 1842 and remained in the Cameron family until acquired by the Stewart-Rankine family in the late 19th century.

He was born in a humble family and showed good skills for drawing since he was a child. He lived his early childhood during the Spanish Civil War. Early, he had contact with other artists, like Pierre de Matheu. He combined his artistic activity with his job as forger in the shipyards of Puerto Real. He was married to Mar√≠a Ligero Bernal and had three sons and eight daughters. He mainly used oil paint in his works, as well as other techniques like fresco painting. His work includes a wide range of themes (landscapes, portraits, marines), all of them in a figurative style. At the same time, he worked in restoration of paintings and sculptures. His most important artistic references and influences must be found among the baroque Spanish painters, such as Vel√°zquez, Murillo or Zurbar√°n and other later ones like Goya. During his lifetime, he took part in many art exhibitions throughout the province of C√°diz. In 1983, the Council of Puerto Real made him work in a big-dimension painting to commemorate the fifth centennial of the foundation of Puerto Real by the Catholic Monarchs of Spain in 1483. That oil painting was placed in the main hall of the old Town Hall in Puerto Real, showing the moment of the foundation of the city in a scene where many local places can be recognised. After his death in 1997, an exhibition reuniting most of his work was organised in Puerto Real. Nowadays, a street in his hometown, has his name.

Indiana University Press. pp. 327-329. The only known species of this genus was Eilenodon robustus. It was a member of a group of rhynchocephalians called opisthodonts, which were large, herbivorous members of Rhynchocephalia, the order of reptiles which contains the modern tuatara (Sphenodon). The generic name \\"Eilenodon\\" is Greek for \\"packed teeth\\", in reference to its closely packed teeth. The specific name, \\"robustus\\", refers to the strong build of the jaws.  Description  Eilenodon robustus is the type species of Eilenodontinae, a subfamily of Opisthodontia. It and other eilenodonts had very wide and strongly packed teeth as well as a deep jaw for chewing and shredding plant material. It is primarily known from an incomplete pair of lower jaws approximately 5 centimeters (2 inches) long. If the jaws were complete, they would have been about 10 centimeters (4 inches) long, signifying that Eilenodon robustus was among the largest species of rhynchocephalians known, surpassed only by its fellow eilenodont Priosphenodon avelasi. Among all other rhynchocephalians, Eilenodon is most similar to Toxolophosaurus, another eilenodont which was redescribed the same year as Eilenodon's description. Even so, there are some differences between the two taxa. = Lower jaw bones = One of the main ways Eilenodon can be differentiated from Toxolophosaurus and its other relatives is the fact that the dentary (lower jaw bone) forms almost the entire length of the lower jaw. Nevertheless, the top half of the back part of the jaw is formed by other bones. The coronoid bone characteristically forms most of the outer edge of the tall coronoid process, which attaches to jaw muscles. The surangular bone forms the upper part of the back of the jaw. The rear tip of the jaw is formed by the articular bone while the inside edge of the jaw possesses a long, plate-like angular bone and a thin prearticular bone directly above it. A mandibular foramen (hole) is present at the intersection point of the dentary, coronoid, and surangular, a position further forward than the mandibular foramen of Toxolophosaurus. = Dentary teeth and jaw orientation = In eilenodonts, the mandibular teeth of the dentary become worn down on two sides due to contact with the maxillary and palatine teeth on the roof of the mouth. This creates two wear facets (worn away areas) in all but the most posterior teeth, converging in a 90 degree angle to form a blade-like ridge. The labial wear facet (worn-away area on the side facing the lips) was originally believed to have been positioned practically vertically while the apical (upward-facing) wear facet would have been positioned nearly horizontally, making the tooth row rectangular in cross-section. Towards the front of the jaw the wear facets shift inwards to a more diagonal position, making the tooth row triangular in cross-section. However, referred material discovered in 2003 proposed an alternative orientation of the lower jaw. This newer interpretation proposes that the upper edge of the jaws were rotated inwards, shifting the rectangular wear facets of the back of the jaw into a position more similar to the triangular shape in the front of the jaws. Eilenodon's dentary teeth differ from those of Toxolophosaurus by being more closely packed and somewhat simpler, only slightly concave from the front and having only two dental ridges per tooth. In addition, as an individual rhynchcephalian matures, additional teeth grow from the back of its jaws. The last few teeth in the holotype jaw of Eilenodon are smaller than the preceding teeth. This indicates that the specimen was not fully grown. However, the teeth of the specimen are more worn than the teeth of the holotype jaw of Toxolophosaurus, which was fully grown due to having the last few teeth larger than the preceding teeth. This may indicate that Eilenodon fed on tougher plant material than Toxolophosaurus. However, other specimens of Eilenodon have preserved unworn rear teeth which were larger than the teeth towards the front of the jaw. Unworn teeth are bulbous with a pointed cusp. = Other bones = The quadrate bone is C-shaped, with the open part pointed backwards and upper and lower tips presumably articulating with the rear edge of the quadratojugal bone. Referred maxilla fragments are low and thick, covered in grooves, and curve sharply inwards above the tooth row. If these fragments are correctly referred to Eilenodon, they indicate that this genus had an unusually low and flat snout. The maxillary teeth only have one wear facet, a horizontal one. Under the 2003 interpretation of Eilenodon's jaws, the wear facets of maxillary teeth would point inwards and downwards, contacting the lateral wear facets of the dentary teeth.  Discovery  The holotype specimen of Eilenodon robustus was collected in 1976 near Fruita in western Colorado, an area known for its Morrison Formation outcrops. This specimen, LACM 120462, was described in 1981 and consists of the rear part of both mandibles of the lower jaw as well as a right quadrate. Additional bone fragments, including a quadratojugal, vertebrae, and ribs, have also been reported from this locality but not described. Four more specimens of Eilenodon found in various parts of Colorado and Eastern Utah between 1977 and 1993 were described in 2003 by John Foster. These include MWC 2907 (a right dentary fragment from Westwater Canyon), BYU 11460 (a dentary fragment from Dry Mesa Quarry), MWC 1200 (a left maxilla fragment from near Uravan), and DMNH 10685 (numerous jaw fragments and teeth from Garden Park). Components of the last specimen were discussed in a 2018 study on the microstructure of Eilenodon teeth. Eilenodon remains have also been reported from a site in Carbon County, Wyoming. Eilenodon is much more rare than another Morrison rhynchocephalian, Opisthias.  Paleobiology  In 2018, Eilenodon was the subject of a study on rhynchocephalian tooth composition and development. This study was also a test for the usefulness of neutron scanning in paleontological applications. Neutron CT scanning is a rarely used alternative to conventional CT scans, which primarily rely on X-rays. Neutron scanning may be more useful than X-ray scanning in certain situations, as it can more easily differentiate between materials of similar density, such as the internal layers of teeth in some fossils. An Eilenodon jaw fragment including a completely unworn tooth was subjected to X-ray and neutron scanning to determine the proportions between pulp, dentine, and enamel in the tooth. The X-ray scans could not differentiate between dentine and enamel as clearly as the neutron scans, which showed that the outer layer of enamel was about half as thick as the inner dentine layer in terms of volume. This enamel thickness was much higher than that of Sphenodon, the modern tuatara. This would have given Eilenodon a much higher bite force and resistance to tooth fracturing than Sphenodon. The teeth would have been able to withstand 2.3 to 3.1 times as much resistance to fracturing and would have had a cumulative maximum bite force of 625 to 843 Newtons, compared to 275 N in Sphenodon. Bite force is also correlated with body size, so the much higher value in Eilenodon is not entirely unexpected considering Eilenodon was much larger than Sphenodon, with an estimated skull length of 11 centimeters compared to 7. Even so, a tuatara scaled up to the head size of Eilenodon would have still had a smaller bite force of approximately 500 N, similar to that of the modern giant tegu (Salvator merianae) and northern caiman lizard (Dracaena guianensis), of the same size. The results suggest that Eilenodon had a very strong bite force even compared to other reptiles of its size. The enamel's thickness is not completely uniform; it is thinnest at the crown of the teeth. This would have allowed wear facets to have been acquired early in life, to facilitate slicing and grinding plant matter. The study suggested that Eilenodon and other opisthodonts may have fed on horsetails of the genus Equisetum, which were nutritious and common in the Morrison Formation, but also high in silica, necessitating sharp and fracture-resistant teeth to process the plants.

His 2009 book, The Fun Minute Manager, was co-written with Robert C. Ford and John Newstrom. Biography According to an interview with American Society for Training & Development (ASTD), Pike began one career as a pastor while doing a side job but still could not make ends meet. In 1967, he tried selling training and management development programs but made only $150 in the first month. Pike then read Psycho-Cybernetics and decided to ignore his fear of rejection for a month and to sell whole-heartedly. \\"So for 30 days, I decided I would do everything I could to succeed, and at the end of 30 days, I could say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm just not cut out for this,‚Äô and I could go do something else,\\" Pike told ASTD. \\"So I used affirmations such as ‚ÄòI‚Äôll do it now‚Äô and my favorite, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a master salesman.‚Äô In those 30 days, I made a little more than $1,100 in commissions, which in 1970 was a lot of money...That was what gave me my start in the training and consulting industry, and that‚Äôs where I started designing training programs.\\" Since 1969, Pike has been developing, marketing, training and consulting on training and human performance improvement. Since then, he has designed and delivered over 600 training programs of one day or longer. He has served on the boards of ASTD, National Speakers Association and the International Alliance for Learning. In 2002, Pike joined the National Board of Lead Like Jesus and since 2005 has served as Chairman of the Executive Board. He served as a designer for the Leadership Encounter with Jesus Seminar/Retreat and is a master trainer for the Encounter certification program.According to an email from Phyllis Hendry, president and CEO of Lead Like Jesus In 2003, Training Magazine subscribers voted The Bob Pike Group the best ‚ÄúTrain-the-Trainer‚Äù company in the industry. In 2007, Bob received the ISA-The Association of Learning Professionals ‚ÄúThought Leader‚Äù award for his contributions to the field. According to ISA, Pike introduced the instructor- led, participant-centered model as an alternative to primarily lecture-based training in 1983 and more than 100,000 trainers worldwide have been through the Creative Training Techniques Train-the-Trainer Boot Camp.ISA press release 2007 In 1991, Pike earned the professional designation of Certified Speaking Professional from the National Speakers Association. In 1999, he was awarded the Council of Peers Award of Excellence.http://www.learningwiki.com/f/Learn2007Webinar1022bp.pdf Over the years, Pike has contributed to magazines like Training, The Personnel Administrator and The Self Development Journal. He is the founder and editor of the Creative Training Techniques Newsletter. Pike is part of the video faculty at CrestCom videos.

The crossing is remarkable, for being first implemented as an overhead crossing, and then later replaced by a cable tunnel. Hydro-Qu√©bec wanted to complete the transmission line in time, which was only possible with an overhead crossing of Saint Lawrence River. However, due to the negative visual impact of the large towers of the overhead crossing on the local populations of Grondines and Lotbini√®re, it was decided to build a cable tunnel under the river, although this made the project more expensive. Overhead crossing construction In 1988 construction work for three artificial islands in the Saint Lawrence River, which were connected with jetties to the mainland as construction for the pylons of the overhead crossing started. Between July 1988 and spring 1989, 20,000 truck loads of were transported. In 1989 the towers of the temporary overhead line crossing were erected. The suspension pylons on each side of the waterway were 140 meters (459 ft) tall to ensure the required clearance.https://structurae.net/en/structures/pylons-of-the- saint-lawrence-river-hvdc-powerline-crossing Building these towers required five months construction time and approximately 40 specially trained workers. At the end of 1989 the overhead crossing, which consisted of five towers, was completed. After the tunnel was completed the overhead line and pylons used for it were dismantled. One of the pylons would later be used for the construction of the La Cit√© de l'√ânergie observation tower.https://structurae.net/en/structures/cite-de-lenergie-observation-tower Underground crossing construction In spring 1989 work on the long cable tunnel started, which took six months of drilling in two 12-hour shifts. The average drilling rate was a day, but achieved in horizontal sections over a day. On March 26, 1990 the tunnel boring machine reached the surface away from its target point. Later the tunnel was covered with concrete, and troughs for the cable support were installed. On November 1, 1990 the underground HVDC transmission line went in service with a transmission rate of 1200 MW, which was increased to 2250 MW on July 1, 1991. In 1992 the overhead line over the Saint Lawrence River, including the artificial islands and the jetties were dismantled. Portions of one of these towers would later be used as part of the observation tower at La Cit√© de l'√ânergie in Shawinigan. The costs for dismantling was $16 Million (CDN).

The Alexander Film Company was founded in 1919 in Spokane, Washington and later based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It produced films that were shown during the intermission at drive-in movie theaters. These films were a mixture of announcements and paid advertisements. The Alexander Film Company was once the world's largest producer of theater film advertising. In today's movie theaters, theater film advertising is what is shown before the trailers which are shown before the featured film. While the Alexander Film Co. only made a whopping $2.50 its first year, the use of advertisements in local movie theaters quickly gained acceptance from theater owners and businesses nationwide. The use of theater advertising grew so rapidly in the early twenties that Alexander Film Co. decided to relocate to a larger studio in Englewood, Colorado in 1923 and then again in 1928 to an even larger lot in Colorado Springs. By the early 1950s Alexander was producing between 2000 and 3000 advertisement films a year and had a library covering over 8200 different subjects. In its heyday, Alexander Film Company's lot hosted 32 full size motion picture sets, modern film and audio laboratories, a sound recording department, an art department capable of creating cartoon animation, stop motion, backgrounds and other special movie effects, an engineering department and a full service print shop. To run this massive complex Alexander employed over 600 people locally and the annual payroll exceeded $2.5 million. A client list included a \\"who's who\\" of the nation's leading manufacturers including General Motors, Ford, U.S. Rubber, Philco, and Seven-Up. Regional offices were established in Dallas, New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The late 1950s saw the remarkable collapse of Alexander Film Co. through the advent of television and the closing of many local theaters throughout the country. What dealt the most crippling blow, however, was the fact that Alexander was a non-union shop which caused them to be \\"blacklisted\\" by industry professionals making it impossible for national advertisers to use Alexander produced commercials. According to surviving employees, after the Alexander Film Company became unionized in the mid 1960s, the plant lost much of the spirit of family that had previously existed between the employees and management.

Pope Martin IV canonized him as a saint in 1284. Life Benvenutus Scotivoli was born sometime in the 1200s in Ancona. Scotivoli studied at the Bologna college and studied jurisprudence with Silvestro Gozzolini at which point he was ordained to the priesthood when he returned to his hometown. He was made the archdeacon of Ancona and later its apostolic administrator on 1 August 1263 before Pope Urban IV appointed him as the Bishop of Osimo on 13 March 1264. Scotivoli ordained Nicholas of Tolentino to the priesthood in 1269. On 15 January 1270 he ordered the San Fiorenzo convent in Posciavalle to sell all of its assets while a diocesan synod on 7 February 1273 saw him ban the sale of all church properties. Scotivoli - on 24 February 1274 - rescinded the excommunication of Ripatransone on the orders of Pope Gregory X that the Bishop of Fermo had instituted before that. He died on 22 March 1284 and was buried in the Osimo Cathedral though his remains were moved down to the crypt in July 1590. Canonization Pope Martin IV canonized him in 1284 and he has been the patron saint of Osimo since 1755 when the civic authorities recognized him as such. Franciscan discrepancies Inspection of his tomb revealed a dark capuche sewn to a lambskin and it led to the biographer Jean Baldi asserting that Scotivoli was a Franciscan which became an accepted proposition. But in 1765 the Osimo priest Pannelli contended he was not a Franciscan but the saint is still recognized on the Franciscan calendar.

The scene comes from a passage in John 13 where before the Last Supper Christ washes the feet of his disciples. This passage called for a complex image with many characters in a variety of poses and motions, and the diversity and challenge attracted Tintoretto. The paintings were commissioned for various churches of Venice, though since then four of the six have left Italy. Prado version and Shipley versions Tintoretto's Last Supper on the left side of the altar at San Marcuola in Venice. The intended place for Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet was on the right side where now is Carlo Ridolfi's copy. The painting was created in 1548/1549 for a church in Venice.Museo del Prado Online gallery Tintoretto The Foot Washing The church of San Marcuola commissioned Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet as a companion piece to Tintoretto's Last Supper, which still hangs at San Marcuola. Christ and St. Peter are at the far right of the image, an unusual position as Christ was typically placed in the centre of any paintings. This is explained by its original positioning in the church on the right side of the altar. Viewing the painting from a side angle allows the perspective of the tiled floor and the gaze of the disciples towards Jesus to emphasise his status as the main subject of the painting. On the far left of the painting is Judas Iscariot, clothed in bright red and noticeably isolated from the other figures of the painting. In the middle of the work are the rest of the disciples gathered around the table that was the site of the supper. They are depicted somewhat humorously as they strive to pull off their stockings. In the background there is a portal above Jesus that opens up to a room where the last supper takes place. The opening to the left shows buildings with elaborate and fantastic architecture. The architecture is based closely on designs by Sebastiano Serlio.Nichols, Tom 2004. Tintoretto: Tradition and Identity. Reaktion Books. . The painting was removed from San Marcuola by the mid-seventeenth century as attested by Carlo Ridolfi. To replace it, Ridolfi himself painted a copy of the painting and this copy remains at San Marcuola. The subsquent history of the original painting is unclear, but it is perhaps the one that is recorded as being part of the collection of King Charles I of England. With the English Civil War much of Charles' collection was broken up. The Tintoretto now in the Prado was purchased in 1654 by Luis M√©ndez de Haro, who gave it to Philip IV of Spain and with other paintings from the royal collection it eventually went to the Museo del Prado.Museo del Prado, Enciclopedia-on-line There is also a version at the Shipley Art Gallery that has the same overall design as the Prado painting, but varies in many small details. There is debate among scholars over how much of these two works were actually done by Tintoretto and how much was done by his workshop assistants. There is also evidence to suggest that the Shipley Art Gallery may in fact own the original: 'It is now considered that the version in the Shipley is the original painting from St. Marcuola. It was moved from the church by 1648, and next heard of when it was put up for auction on 2 June 1814 at Phillips in London by Alexis Delahante, a French dealer and entrepreneur who was returning to live in Paris. As lot 43 it was sold to H. Baring Esq., of Devonshire Place, London for ¬£32.12.0 and was sold by him the next day to Sir Matthew White Ridley of Blagdon, Northumberland for ¬£43.1.0. The painting was subsequently given to the Church, now Cathedral, of St Nicholas, Newcastle upon Tyne, where it was hung in July 1818. Following its authentication in 1976 by Rodolfo Palluchini, an expert in Tintoretto's work, it was sent to London for cleaning and restoration, and offered on loan to Tyne and Wear Museums in 1980, when it was hung in the Shipley Art Gallery. In 1982, it was shown in the major exhibition 'The Genius of Venice' at the Royal Academy, London. The painting was purchased from the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St. Nicholas, Newcastle, for Tyne and Wear Museums in 1986. Financial assistance was kindly given by the National Art Collections Fund, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the V&A;/MGC Purchase Grant Fund, the Pilgrim Trust and the Sir James Knott Trust.' Art historian Christopher Lloyd, whose main areas of expertise include the Italian Renaissance, French Impressionism and British Art, describes the Shipley version in his book In Search of a masterpiece: An art lover's guide to Great Britain and Ireland: 'This enormous canvas once adorned the right-hand side of the chancel of the church of S. Marcuola in Venice, where it was balanced on the left by the 'Last Supper'. While the latter remains in the church, this seems to have been removed for some reason, possibly as early as the 17th century. It may have belonged to Sir Joshua Reynolds in the 18th century; in 1814 it was sold in London to Sir Matthew White Ridley, who presented it to the church of St Nicholas in Newcastle upon Tyne four years later. Shipley Art Gallery purchased it in 1987 adding one of the finest Venetian pictures in the country to its collection.' Toronto version As it was common for private collectors to request copies of a noted public work, there is also a version of this painting in Toronto. This version had for many years been part of the collection of the Irish noble family the Barons of Farnham. In 1959 it was loaned to the Art Gallery of Ontario in a deal orchestrated by Sir Anthony Blunt. The price for the gallery to permanently own the work was put at $100,000, and a major fundraising project was launched. This price worked out to roughly $10 per inch, and in the hall of the gallery a copy of the painting was displayed covered in one inch white squares. For every ten dollar donation one of the squares was removed. With the participation of schools, church groups, and others the money was raised in less than a year and the painting was purchased for the permanent collection.\\"Two Tintoretto's Arrive by Air.\\" Toronto Star.

It dates from c. 1575 ‚Äì 1580 The National Gallery Tintoretto Christ Washing the Disciples' Feet and was commissioned for the church of San Trovaso. It was also paired with a painting of the Last Supper. It is a far more intimate image than the San Marcuola version set in a much smaller room. Christ is at the centre of the painting, again washing St. Peter's feet as the other disciples gather round. =Painting materials= The painting underwent a thorough cleaning and restoration in the National Gallery shortly before 1979. The scientists of the Gallery also investigated the technical aspects of the painting and the painting materials used by Tintoretto.Plesters, J. 'Tintoretto's Paintings in the National Gallery: Part II'. National Gallery Technical Bulletin Vol 4, 1980, pp 32‚Äì48 Main pigments in this painting are ultramarine, red lakes (kermes, madder and lac), malachite and azurite. Tintoretto also used the rare arsenic sulfide pigments realgar and orpiment. An illustrated pigment analysis can be found at ColourLex.Tintoretto, Christ Washing the Feet of the Disciples, ColourLex It remained at San Trovaso until purchased by a British collector sometime around 1797. It eventually came into the possession of the Dukes of Hamilton where it was displayed at Hamilton Palace. In 1882 they sold a large portion of their collection, and the Tintoretto was purchased by the National Gallery.

DubaiSat-1 was launched on 29 July 2009 into a 680 km altitude sun- synchronous polar orbit from the Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan, along with several other satellites on board the Dnepr launch vehicle. Overview An external view of DubaiSat-1 and coordinate system. DubaiSat-1's DMAC Mechanical Structure. DubaiSat-1 observes the earth at a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and generates high-resolution optical images at 2.5 m in panchromatic (black- and-white) and at 5 m in multispectral (colour) bands. These images provide decision makers in the UAE as well as EIAST clients with a valuable tool for a wide range of applications including infrastructure development, urban planning, and environment monitoring and protection. DubaiSat-1 images are also useful for promoting geosciences and remote sensing research in the region, and for supporting different scientific disciplines in private and academic sectors. For example, DubaiSat-1 images have been used, to monitor progress on The World megaproject, Palm Islands, and the Al Maktoum International Airport. The United Nations also used DubaiSat-1 images to monitor relief efforts following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The satellite accommodates two main payloads. The primary payload is the Dubai Medium Aperture Camera (DMAC), and the secondary and experimental payload, the Space Radiation Monitor (SRM). The DMAC system is pushbroom imaging system with one panchromatic and four multi-spectral imaging channels. It also consists of an Electro-Optical Subsystem and the Payload Management Subsystem. The Electro-Optical Subsystem has a telescope, a focal plane assembly, and a Signal Processing Module. The Payload Management Subsystem consists of the Thermal and Power Module and the Mass storage and Control Module. The Space Radiation Monitor, the secondary and experimental payload, is capable of measuring the total ionizing dose from the charged particles at the orbits of satellites. The instrument utilizes four p-type Metal-Oxide- Semiconductor Field Effects Transistors (MOSFETs). These devices measure the current-voltage characteristics of the satellite. Subsequent analysis will allow measurements of the amount of cumulative ionizing dose, and of the total ionizing dose of the devices. Structure DubaiSat-1 has a hexagonal body with three deployable solar panels. The frame includes spacecraft adaptors, six longerons, rails, an inner ring that provides rigidity and stability of the satellite's camera, inner rods and three decks. Three spacecraft adaptors connect with shear brackets and mechanically couple the satellite and separation adaptor of the launch vehicle, the Dnepr rocket. Each one of the spacecraft adaptors has separation sensors to monitor the separation condition between the satellite and the launch vehicle. The umbilical connector attaches on the lower surface of the bottom deck with its mounting support bracket. Ground Station Components The ground station components of DubaiSat-1. EIAST's Ground Station is located in Dubai, and is the only ground system supporting the DubaiSat-1 mission. The ground system consists of three main subsystems: =Antenna and RF Subsystem= The Antenna and RF subsystem consists of an 11.28 metre antenna system, an S-band transmitter feed, an S-band receiver feed, an X-band receiver feed, and a tracking system. The RF equipment is used to communicate with the satellite. It receives X-band RF signals and performs RF processing. It also produces a demodulated and bit- synchronized data stream from X-band signals. In general, it are to transmit imaging orders and command the satellite through the S-band transmitter feed; receive information and health status from the satellite through the S-band receiver feed; and download the images through the X-band feed. =Mission Control Station= From the Mission Control Station, EIAST staff plan and operate the entire space mission, including the configuration and scheduling of resources for both space and ground elements. It also monitors and commands the satellite. =Image Receiving and Processing Station= The third component of the ground system is the Image Receiving and Processing Station (IRPS). The IRPS receives and processes the X-band downlink data in real-time. This includes generation of standard image products and catalogues for integration with system management; for archive management; and for comprehensive user interface to provide easy access to satellite image data. The IRPS is located at EIAST's ground station in Dubai. It has a direct interface with the main mission control station and it generates schedule requests which includes imaging and download schedules. It also archives image and ancillary data for product generation and distribution. Applications=Infrastructure development= Satellite imagery provides an alternative way of looking at the world. It can add significant incremental data useful in a wide range of applications. The high-resolution spatial images can complement the existing geographic information system databases too. DubaiSat-1 images support infrastructure development in the UAE and the Persian Gulf region. These images assist decision makers involved in urban and rural planning, transportation, utilities and mapping. Some images were also useful for monitoring progress on the Dubai World Megaproject, Palm Islands and the Al Maktoum International Airport. =Environmental= Many environmental and meteorological events such as vegetation stress, fog, land degradation, sandstorms, desertification and droughts cannot be captured by ground measurements alone, making remote sensing an important tool in environmental monitoring. The sun-synchronous orbit of DubaiSat-1 merges with data from geostationary missions to provide enhancements on existing models. Additionally, due to their low precipitation rates, arid regions are the world's major source of atmospheric dust that affects local, regional and global climate. Dust and sand storms create potentially hazardous air quality for humans, and adversely affect climate on regional and worldwide scales. Remote sensing is a demonstrably valuable tool for detecting, mapping and forecasting such events. However, arid and semi arid regions have their own specific and unique characteristics and vulnerabilities that require special attention when adapting existing remote sensing tools efficiently. Satellite imaging helps monitor and improve management of the world's agricultural resources. Multispectral images contribute by monitoring land use, generating vegetation indices, and monitoring water quality. =Disaster relief= Satellite images are useful tools to assist disaster relief teams to determine how to tackle rescue and recovery efforts in the wake of catastrophic natural, or even man-made, events. In the aftermath of the tsunami in Japan on March 11, 2011, EIAST applied DubaiSat-1 to help disaster relief teams determine and manage the scale of the event. DubaiSat-2 DubaiSat-2 is an electro-optical earth observation satellite system to be launched and operated by Emirates Institution for Advanced Science and Technology. The spacecraft will have a ground sampling distance of 1 meter at 600 km in a sun-synchronous orbit. DubaiSat-2 will have the capacity to store approximately 17,000 km2 of image data. It is relatively small, weighing less than 300 kg and suitable for commercial use within the UAE or other regions worldwide. The electro-optical payload is a push-broom camera with TDI sensors. The launch was scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2012 and is ready, but launch practicalities will move it into 2013.

After winning The Ugliest Woman contest in 1935, Grace joined Harry Lewiston's sideshow, traveling around the country and some parts of Canada. Although she embraced her disability, McDaniels never liked having her picture taken, because she felt that advertising herself would show a lack of self-respect.

The centrally located city of Moncton was selected in 1940 for the site of a logistics supply base for military facilities in the Maritimes that were undergoing unprecedented expansion as a result of World War II. Moncton Garrison was constructed in an industrial area on a railway spur line north of downtown, immediately east of the sprawling Canadian National Railways Moncton Shops facility. The Moncton Garrison survived into the Cold War and was renamed Canadian Forces Base Moncton (CFB Moncton) in February 1968 following the unification of the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force to create the Canadian Forces. Under the Canadian Forces, CFB Moncton was initially attached to Materiel Command however this command was closed in June 1968 and the base was attached to Maritime Command. Defence budget cuts in the 1990s following the end of the Cold War saw CFB Moncton identified for closure as a formation. It stood down on April 1, 1996 and at that time was replaced by Canadian Forces Base Gagetown - Detachment Moncton, also known as Moncton Garrison, a unit of CFB Gagetown. CFB Gagetown - Detachment Moncton supports the following units stationed at the garrison: * Sub-unit of The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment * Headquarters and A Squadron 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) * Headquarters 37 Canadian Brigade Group * 303 Military Police Platoon (3 Military Police Regiment (Canada)) Closure In April 2012, the Department of National Defence announced that Moncton Garrison would be closed in the near future.

He offered his own theory on the origin of inertia instead. With the announcement on July 4, 2012 by scientists at CERN that they had detected the Higgs boson Afshar appeared to have lost the bet.

The remote area has no passenger car access. Access Users of SRW must enter it via the Greenbrier River (easily fordable at low-normal flows upstream of Spice Run), or by hiking in from the adjacent Calvin Price State Forest, or by driving a high- clearance vehicle to the southeastern corner of the Wilderness along Greenbrier County Route 16.  History  Spice Run was named after a native shrub, Lindera benzoin ‚Äî known as \\"spicebush\\" or \\"spicewood\\". The Spice Run Lumber Company created a logging boom town that harvested stands of timber to float down the Greenbrier River for the sawmills. So great were these log runs, that the waterways were choked. In 2009, Spice Run was designated a Wilderness along with several other areas of Monongahela National Forest.  Ecology  Aside from Spice Run, the Davy Run and Kincaid Run watersheds are within the Spice Run Wilderness. All three are native brook trout tributaries to the Greenbrier River. Besides fishing, camping, hiking, botany and bird watching are popular activities. There are at least 230 species of birds to watch. Nine animals are on the Federal list for endangered species or threatened species such as the northern flying squirrel. Across the Greenbrier River rests the Greenbrier River Trail, maintained by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources along the former Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Greenbrier Subdivision. This portion still shows traces of the old lumber-mill on the banks where the flow of logs was controlled. Of the original community of Spice Run, only one house remains standing.

It is the first film directed by Sarab Singh Neelam, a Sikh gastroenterologist from Troy, Michigan. It was written by Neelam and Veerendra Prasad. Plot Dr. Amrit Singh, A young Sikh surgeon, moves from Toronto to Detroit to take a position at a new transplant facility, leaving behind his family and Indian girlfriend. The film follows Amrit's struggles against the pressures to assimilate, including considering removing his turban and cutting his hair, racial discrimination, an unfair medical system in which uninsured patients cannot receive transplants, and romantic temptation in the shape of an attractive colleague. The film is semi- autobiographical, and reflects the experience of Sikhs in America post-9/11. Awards and screenings Ocean of Pearls won Best Feature Film at the 2009 Detroit Windsor International Film Festival, the Grand Jury Prize and Audience Choice Award at the 2008 Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, and the Audience Choice Award at the 2008 Toronto ReelWorld Film Festival. The film showed at the 10th International Film Festival, Mumbai, in March 2008. and the Cannes Film Festival by iDream Independent Pictures. Cast and crew Director Sarab Neelam lived in India until his family moved to Toronto when he was aged 10. He spent ten years learning filmmaking while working as a hospital doctor before making the film, taking advice from Kurt Luedtke who directed Out Of Africa. Omid Abtahi, previously in Over There stars as Amrit, Navi Rawat from The O.C. and Numb3rs plays Amrit's girlfriend, Ajay Mehta of Americanizing Shelley plays his father, Ron Canada plays the Detroit doctor who tempts Amrit to his new post, Heather McComb plays his attractive colleague, Todd Babcock plays a Senator's son vying for the same post as Amrit, and Brenda Strong of Desperate Housewives plays a transplant patient. Local members of the Sikh community appeared as extras and offered their gurdwara for production and sets. Jim Burnstein, who previously worked on Renaissance Man, was an executive producer and assisted with the script. Burnstein first met Neelam in the late 1980s, when he pitched filming a Middle Eastern epic, but Burnstein was interested in Neelam's own life story. He advised Neelam to change the main character from a Caucasian doctor to a Sikh. Jeff Dowd was another executive producer. Reception The San Francisco Chronicle said \\"it sounds heavy-handed, and it is. Although the film looks professional, it feels like a soap opera with a message.\\" Asia Pacific Arts included the film in its top ten films of 2008, saying that \\"its domestic and romantic melodrama feels true and never sensational, while its passion to reveal social injustice is never didactic.\\" The Detroit News and the Detroit Metro Times both gave the film a C+ rating, Tom Long concluding that \\"as a vehicle for demystifying the Sikh life while again highlighting the confusion of the modern world, \\"Ocean of Pearls\\" works well indeed.\\" Variety argued that the \\"mix of tepid hospital intrigue plus underdeveloped cultural/relationship conflicts feels like a routine TV episode stretched to feature length, with little dramatic urgency or cinematic style to render its good intentions compelling.\\" SF Weekly said \\"Mishandled, this film would be very funny in a bad way, but Neelam skirts the very real perils of risibility.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2008 films 2008 drama films American films American drama films Indian-American films ","title":"Ocean of Pearls"},{"id":"23790725","text":"The International Theological Institute (ITI) is a Catholic theological school in Austria.
