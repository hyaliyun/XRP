It varies widely across the nations and also between urban and rural areas within a country. Telephone density has significant correlation with the per capita GDP of the area. It is also used as an indicator of the purchasing power of the middle class of the country or specific region. Determining telephone density In earlier days teledensity was computed as the number of fixed telephone lines per hundred inhabitants. But this method has become less significant with an increasing number of countries register a trend of mobile cellular subscribers outnumbering the fixed line connections. Hence, as an alternative, mobidensity or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants was proposed. Since this method caused disadvantage to some countries where the fixed line network is well established, or others where the mobile network is still in its initial stage of development, effective teledensity has been proposed by ITU as the solution, which is defined as either fixed line connections or mobile subscribers per hundred inhabitants ‚Äì whichever is higher. Fixed telephone lines per hundred inhabitants is calculated by dividing the number of fixed telephone lines by the total population and then multiplying by 100. Fixed telephone lines include PSTN, WLL, ISDN and DSL. A single ISDN or DSL subscriber connection may cater to multiple voice channels. This leads to a lack of global standard in the computation of fixed line density and hence ITU has recommended that all the countries shall provide the methodology of calculation of this figure in order to enhance comparability. Mobidensity or mobile cellular subscribers per hundred inhabitants is obtained by dividing the number of mobile cellular subscribers by the population and multiplying by 100. While computing Mobile cellular subscribers users of both post-paid subscriptions and pre-paid accounts are included. Inactive prepaid connections where a call has not been made or received within the last 3 months, are excluded. Teledensity and GDP The correlation between teledensity and per capita GDP could be represented by a straight line in a logarithmic graph. This relation was first mentioned by A.G.W. Jipp. a German engineer, in his book published in 1962. The graph is helpful to compare the telephone infrastructure development of different countries or regions, on the basis of teledensity.

The incident killed 25 people while 43 people were injured. Three coaches derailed as a result of the crash while another caught fire. The fire was brought under control and rescue and relief operations started in a couple of hours. Railway Minister Mukul Roy, who was in Kolkata, rushed to the site of the accident and ordered an inquiry into it. Early reports suggested that Hampi Express overshot a signal and collided with a stationary goods train. Roy also announced a compensation of Rs 500,000 to the next of kin of the deceased, Rs 100,000 for those who sustained grievous injuries and Rs 50,000 to those who received minor injuries. Overview=Crash According to Railway sources, the over- speeding Hampi Express collided with stationary goods train at around 3:00 a.m when allegedly train driver overlooked the signal that kicked three coaches comprising two general bogies and one sleeper off the tracks. Primarily 15 dead bodies have been recovered and over 70 injured passengers were rushed to nearby hospitals in Anantpur district while seriously injured were referred to Bangalore. Prima-facie, it looks like that the driver overlooked the signal or there was some error in signal that cause this mishap, said a Railway official by adding that whatever, the matter was, Railway ministry has ordered a probe and the reason would come there after. The next morning, reports suggested that 21 people were killed in the accident. Of them, 11 were charred to death in the first coach, which caught fire, while the rest were trapped to death in the third coach. The first three coaches of the train derailed due to the impact of the collision. Finally that evening, the death toll was put at 25 while Andhra Pradesh police were still carrying out the rescue operations. \\"I heard a deafening sound around 3:15 in the morning. I jumped out of the train fearing for my life and saw people crammed into the compartment toilet,\\" recalled Rahman, one of the passengers who survived the crash. \\"The carriage was a mangled wreck and fire engulfed it. Many women and children suffered scalding burns. It is one of the most horrific scenes I have ever seen in my life,\\" he added. Lakshman T Basapur, a new recruit of the railway department, was travelling in S-7 bogie along with his brother Venkappa to report for work on the first, said: \\"I was sleeping on the upper berth and there was a huge jerk. I fell on the floor of the train and realised it had met with an accident killing passengers travelling in the general compartment bogie just behind the locomotive. I was lucky enough as I suffered only minor injuries caused by the fall.\\" CNN IBN, in its final report on the crash, stated that as many as 25 passengers, who were in deep sleep, died and over 100 others were injured. Most of the victims were from Karnataka. Among the deceased, 17 were in the women's compartment which took the maximum impact and the remaining were in a sleeper coach and a general bogie next to it. While 24 passengers died on the spot, another person, identified as Maganappa, died while undergoing treatment at a hospital in Pavagada in Karnataka. The bodies in the general bogie were charred, making identification difficult. Probing Safety engineers, who were part of the rescue special that steamed in from Bangalore to Penukonda in the wake of the accident, said the loss of lives could have been avoided if only the loco pilot had been alert. Under such circumstances, the loco pilot should not have overlooked the danger signal that denied him entry to the station until the goods train moved out of Penukonda railway station, said experts after a preliminary examination of the accident spot. Nevertheless, M.Y. Ratnam, a loco pilot with the South Central Railway's Guntakal zone, and co-pilot Balaraju escaped, probably because they jumped out of the train immediately after applying the emergency brake. Had they not applied the brake, the impact of the collision would have spread to more coaches increasing the toll, the safety engineers said. Speaking to The Hindu, the guard of the Hampi Express, Bhagwan, said he had no clue that the train had actually jumped a danger signal that denied entry into Penukonda station. He said that he was among the first to run into the station for help and denied rumours that himself or the pilots tried to escape. Meanwhile, experts in the signalling system for the railways at Guntakal said an enquiry into the incident would bring out the truth. They denied any possibility of the driver having been under the influence of alcohol, as all pilots were subjected to a breathalyser test and that unless they passed it, they would not be allowed for duty. Recovery A day after the crash, The public relations officer (PRO) of Indian Railways, Anil Saxena, said that rescue operations at the train collision site at Penukonda in Andhra Pradesh is almost over with most passengers being sent to their respective destinations safely. \\"Relief and rescue operation is almost over, most of the coaches have been tackled but the last coach which was being tackled was the SLR coach next to the engine, that has also been tackled and now the technician team and the officials and the staff there, some of them have entered the coach to ascertain any possible survivors. All the injured have been admitted in the Penukonda hospital and Puttaparthi hospital,\\" said Saxena. When asked about the disruption of traffic on the route, he explained that the traffic was not disrupted on the section as one line was made functional immediately after the crash the previous morning and only some trains had to be delayed while one train was cancelled. As far as the stranded passengers were concerned of the ill-fated train, they all were taken to their respective destinations. Some of them were transported through 10 buses that were arranged by the railways, some of them were taken through Bangalore Rajdhani Express and Udyan Express which was passing through that route.

He appeared in over 50 films between 1936 and 1970. His stage name comes from an incident following the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake when he was attacked by a mob in Sendagaya, Tokyo. The vigilantes mistook him for a Korean.

Anonymous bloggers may achieve anonymity through the simple use of a pseudonym, or through more sophisticated techniques such as layered encryption routing, manipulation of post dates, or posting only from publicly accessible computers. Motivations for posting anonymously include a desire for privacy or fear of retribution by an employer (e.g., in whistleblower cases), a government (in countries that monitor or censor online communication), or another group. Deanonymizing techniques Fundamentally, deanonymization can be divided into two categories: *Social correlation compares known details about a person's life with the contents of an anonymous blog to look for similarities. If the author makes no attempt to conceal their identity, social correlation is a very straightforward procedure: a simple correlation between the \\"anonymous\\" blogger's name, profession, lifestyle, etc. and the known person. Even if an author generally attempts to conceal their identity (by not providing their name, location, etc.), the blog can be deanonymized by correlating seemingly innocuous, general details. *Technical identification determines the author's identity through the blog's technical details. In extreme cases, technical identification entails looking at the server logs, the Internet provider logs, and payment information associated with the domain name. These techniques may be used together. The order of techniques employed typically escalates from the social correlation techniques, which do not require the compliance of any outside authorities (e.g., Internet providers, server providers, etc.), to more technical identification. Types Just as a blog can be on any subject, so an anonymous blog can be on any subject. Most fall into the following major categories: *Political: A commentary on the political situation within a country, where being open may risk prosecution. Anonymous blogging can also add power to a political debate, such as in 2008 when blogger Eduwonkette, later revealed as Columbia University sociology graduate student Jennifer Jennings, successfully questioned New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's takeover of New York schools. *Revolutionary and counter- revolutionary: These can either be inspiring activity or counter activity, often against a violent state apparatus. For example, Salam Pax, the Baghdad blogger, wrote for The Guardian newspaper under a pseudonym that he could shed only when Saddam Hussein no longer ruled in Iraq. Similar bloggers appeared during the Arab Spring. *Dissident: Dissident blogs may document life under an oppressive or secretive regime, while not actively promoting or inspiring revolutionary or counter-revolutionary action. Mosul Eye, which has described life under ISIL occupation in Mosul, Iraq, has been called one of the few reliable sources of information on life inside the city since it began in June 2014. *Religious: Views and comments about religious view points and issues, perhaps questioning some written standpoints. *Whistleblower: The whistleblower blog is a modern-day twist on the classical \\"insider spotting illegality\\" theme. This can cover all sectors or issues. Among the most notable is that by the Irish Red Cross head of the international department Noel Wardick, who highlighted that ‚Ç¨162,000 in donations to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami had sat in an account for over three years. After spending over ‚Ç¨140,000 on private investigators and legal expenses to find the whistle blower, including court orders to obtain Wardick's identity from UPC and Google,Charlie Taylor (27 August 2010) \\"Red Cross blogger reveals identity\\" Irish Times the IRC disciplined and later dismissed Wardick. In 2010, an internal enquiry into Wardick's allegations found other such bank accounts, and proposals to overhaul the IRC's management were discussed in the D√°il on 15 December. Questions were answered by Tony Killeen, then the Minister of Defence.\\"D√°il debate on the IRC\\". 15 December 2010 Wardick later successfully sued the IRC for unfair dismissal. *Company insider: A company employee or insider reports on company operations and issues from within the organisation. The most famous is probably the Dooce.com blogger Heather Armstrong, who was fired for writing satirical accounts of her experiences at a dot-com startup on her personal blog, dooce.com. *Community pressure: Written by a citizen of an area, on a particular subject, to bring about a change. In 2007, reporter and blogger Mike Stark came out in support of anonymous blogger Spocko, who was trying to bring what he called \\"violent commentary\\" on San Francisco area radio station KSFO to the attention of its advertisers. *Experience/Customer Service: Most experience blogs focus on personal insights or views of customer service, frequently with dissatisfaction. Most anonymous experience blogs are written anonymously as they allow the customer/user to keep experiencing and using the service, and reporting/blogging, while nudging at a defined and appropriate level against the target organisation. Among these are Sarah Wu's/Mrs Q. \\"Fed Up With Lunch\\" blog, a chronicle of her experience as an adult eating Chicago area high school lunch every day for a year, which has now been turned into a book. *Personal: The personal blog strays into personal life in ways that allow more risk taking and open in terms of detail. Hence, many of these blogs are sexual in nature, although many also exist for those with health problems and disabilities and how they see the world and cope with its challenges. Some of the latest personal blogs are seen by many as extended group therapy, covering issues including weight loss. Recently, anonymous blogging has moved into a more aggressive and active style, with organized crime groups such as the Mafia using anonymous blogs against mayors and local administrators in Italy. How online identity is determined=IP addresses An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to a computer connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication., DOD Standard Internet Protocol (January 1980) The most popular implementation of the Internet Protocol would be the Internet (capitalized, to differentiate it from smaller internetworks). Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are allocated chunks of IP addresses by a Regional Internet registry, which they then assign to customers. However, ISPs do not have enough addresses to give the customers their own address. Instead, DHCP is used; a customer's device (typically a modem or router) is assigned an IP address from a pool of available addresses. It keeps that address for a certain amount of time (e.g., two weeks). If the device is still active at the end of the lease, it can renew its connection and keep the same IP address. Otherwise, the IP address is collected and added to the pool to be redistributed. Thus, IP addresses provide regional information (through Regional Internet registries) and, if the ISP has logs, specific customer information. While this does not prove that a specific person was the originator of a blog post (it could have been someone else using that customer's Internet, after all), it provides powerful circumstantial evidence. Word and character frequency analysis Character frequency analysis takes advantage of the fact that all individuals have a different vocabulary: if there is a large body of data that can be tied to an individual (for example, a public figure with an official blog), statistical analysis can be applied to both this body of data and an anonymous blog to see how similar they are. In this way, anonymous bloggers can tentatively be deanonymized.

Plot Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) decide to leave Gene's ranch in order to pursue cattle rustlers who have been terrorizing the range. The men they are following, the Apache Kid (Max Hoffman Jr.) and Black Jim (Charles King), kill two lawmen and exchange clothes with them. When Gene and Frog discover the bodies, they decide to take their clothes and, disguised as wanted outlaws, head for the border. Gene discovers that Joe Stafford (Monte Blue), a supposed upstanding head of the cattlemen's association, is the boss behind the rusting gang. When Stafford's niece, Rosa Montero (Armida), and his stepdaughter Mary Ellen (Ann Pendleton) mistake Gene and Frog for the Apache Kid and Black Jim, they turn them in to the deputies, who turn out to be the real outlaws in disguise. Gene and Frog are able to escape, and with the help of Gene's partner, Buffalo Bradey (Hal Taliaferro), and a group of singing cowhands, who eventually reveal themselves to be Texas Rangers, the rustlers are captured.

At the start of the 20th century local residents successfully campaigned for a new public park on 24 acres of land on Denmark Hill, and it opened to the public on 2 February 1907. The park was laid out by the notable parks designer Lt. Colonel J.J. Sexby. In 1910 Ruskin Park was enlarged by the addition of a further 12 acres (5 ha) to the south west. The park is named after John Ruskin (1819‚Äì1900), a poet, writer and a major champion of diverse green spaces as well as of the Arts and Crafts movement, who lived nearby from 1823 to 1871. He gives his name equally to a college, museum and square.

It is based on the idea of enclosing an object within a cube or another hull object, and transforming the object within the hull as the hull is deformed. Deformation of the hull is based on the concept of so-called hyper-patches, which are three-dimensional analogs of parametric curves such as B√©zier curves, B-splines, or NURBs. The technique was first described by Thomas W. Sederberg and Scott R. Parry in 1986, and is based on an earlier technique by Alan Barr. It was extended by Coquillart to a technique described as extended free-form deformation, which refines the hull object by introducing additional geometry or by using different hull objects such as cylinders and prisms.  Applications  * Free-Form Deformation is used in computer graphics for solid geometric models. For example, the Lattice Modifier in Blender (software). * It is used in the image registration in both rigid and non-rigid transformation.Nonrigid Registration Using Free-Form Deformations: Application to Breast MR Images  References  External links  * 3D Free-form Deformation * C++ Library Geometry in computer vision Graphic design Curves ","title":"Free-form deformation"},{"id":"36017489","text":"North Leverett is a historic mill village of Leverett, Massachusetts. Centered on the intersection of North Leverett Road with Chestnut Hill Road and Cave Hill Road it includes predominantly residential buildings that were built during the height of the area's industrial activity between the 1770s and mid-19th century. The architecture is mainly Federal and Greek Revival in style, including the 1832 North Leverett Baptist Church. The Slarrow Mill is the only remaining component of the village's industrial past. The village was listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The town of Leverett was first settled in the mid-18th century, and was incorporated (by separation from Sunderland) in 1774. North Leverett was the site of an early inn (no longer standing) operated by Richard Montague, one of the first settlers. The soil in Leverett was too poor to support market-based agriculture, and the Sawmill River was seen as a good source of water power for industrial use. Joseph Slarrow, another early settler, purchased land on the river in North Leverett, and established the sawmill that still stands today. By the mid-19th century, the village was the most substantial industrial center in the entire town, producing lumber, shingles, and scythes. Industry declined in the early 20th century, and now only archaeological remains and the Slarrow mill survive as a reminder of that activity.

Diplomatic representation Permanent Mission of Indonesia to the UN in New York Indonesia has two permanent diplomatic missions to the UN in New York City and Geneva. These missions are headed by a Permanent Representative and an Ambassador. The Government of the Republic of Indonesia appointed Lambertus Nicodemus Palar as the first Permanent Representative to the United Nations. Palar had played a major role in efforts for the international recognition of the independence of Indonesia at the time of the conflict with the Netherlands in 1947, and had argued the case for the sovereignty of Indonesia in the UN as an Observer to the organization. Speaking at the UN General Assembly session in 1950, Ambassador Palar thanked all the supporters of Indonesia‚Äôs sovereignty and pledged that his country would carry out its obligations as a member of the United Nations. The responsibility of the Indonesian Mission is to represent the Indonesian interests in the UN including international security, disarmament, human rights, humanitarian affairs, environment, labor, international economic cooperation and development, international trade, South‚ÄìSouth cooperation, technology transfer, intellectual property rights, telecommunications, health, and meteorology. Withdrawal in 1965 During the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation of 1965, and in response to the election of Malaysia as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, Indonesia decided to withdraw from the UN. (Indonesia did not withdraw from the UN but informed Secretary-General U Thant that it would suspend its participation) Indonesian president, Sukarno, then created a rival to UN named CONEFO. However, in a telegram dated 19 September 1966, after General Suharto de facto assumed effective control of the Government, Indonesia notified the Secretary-General of its decision \\"to resume full cooperation with the United Nations and to resume participation in its activities starting with the twenty-first session of the General Assembly\\".

It is a film realised from the point of view of a blind person. It has been presented in more than 100 international film festivals receiving several awards. Plot Rita is ten years old and blind since birth, lives in a seaside neighbourhood of Palermo in Sicily. She is stubborn, curious and feels thwarted by an overprotective dictatorial mother. The claustrophobic world of her home is suddenly breached by a mysterious presence. It's a boy on the run, wounded, terrified. The meeting between the two of them is highly enigmatic. Thanks to her mysterious new friend, or perhaps only thanks to her imagination and courage, Rita escapes from home and goes to the beach. She learns to swim and experiences a brief moment of freedom which ends when the miraculous encounter vanishes and she finds herself alone in the sea. Film structure During this short film the camera is focused on Rita, without reverse angle shots. Rita is under everyone‚Äôs gaze, the gaze of others which acts also as a controlling element, a form of surveillance. We can‚Äôt see what Rita has before her because she can‚Äôt either. For example, we see her mother‚Äôs hands flit in and out of the frame, when her mother is fussing around her, but we never see her mother. We feel the desire to see what stands before her but, for the most part of the short film, we are not granted any gratification of this desire. For Rita hearing is fundamental, and that is why the story, from her ‚Äúpoint of view‚Äù is told through the sounds, the noises. The sounds represent what we can‚Äôt see, they evoke it, and to some extent create it. Only through an unexpected and enigmatic encounter does the staging change, because this meeting suddenly enables her to \\"see\\" and we, for the first time, are gifted with her perspective and share her vision. The film explores this brief moment of grace. Then everything goes back to normal for Rita and for us.

Located within the commercial docks at Hakin, it was constructed to service an anticipated transatlantic trade between Milford Haven and New York City. It was the terminus of the Milford Junction Railway, itself a branch of the South Wales Railway. Opened in 1888, it was short lived and was no longer operating as a station for passengers by the early 20th century.  History  The first links to a railway to Milford Haven came through the completion of the South Wales Railway in 1856. Isambard Kingdom Brunel had a vision of connecting London to New York City via a railway through Wales and then to a commuter port. The initial plan was to terminate the line at Fishguard and to create a ferry service to Ireland. The failure to complete Irish rail links meant that the terminus was modified to a location on the Milford Haven waterway. 1854 saw track reach Haverfordwest, at which point a decision had to be made as to the terminus. New Milford at Neyland was selected, in spite of opposition from Greville, and was completed in April 1856.Wing Commander Ken McKay A Vision Of Greatness: The History of Milford 1790-1990, Brace Harvatt Associates, 1989. As a result, Greville determined to finance a project himself which would see the railway come to Milford Haven under the Milford Junction Railway, a four-mile spur from Johnston. Construction began in August 1856 and lasted five years, finally completed in 1863,James Frederick Rees The Story of Milford, University Of Wales Press, 1954 ASIN B000MYZBCQ when the line was connected to the South Wales Railway at Johnston, and a station at Milford was opened. Public services commenced 7 September 1863. Further track was laid towards the recently constructed docks complex in 1875. A spur to Newton Noyes, known as the 'Estate Line', was completed in 1882. It connected with a pier, which was reached via a lifting bridge at Castle Pill; the junction with the Milford line opposite the station.\\"Vision of Britain Descriptive Gazetteer entry for MILFORD\\", Wilson, John Marius (1870-1872). Retrieved 9 October 2011 This development highlighted Milford station's less than favorable location, although equidistant between the two major populations of Milford and Hakin, it was at a distance from the quayside and with no discernible pedestrian access.

It is rice congee with shredded chicken meat served with some condiments, such as chopped scallion, crispy fried shallot, celery, tongcay (preserved salted vegetables), fried soybean, Chinese crullers (youtiao, known as cakwe in Indonesia), and both salty and sweet soy sauce, and sometimes topped with yellow chicken broth and kerupuk (Indonesian-style crackers). Unlike many other Indonesian dishes, it is not spicy; sambal or chili paste is served separately. It is a favourite breakfast food, served by humble travelling vendors, warung (small local shops), fast food establishments, and five-star hotel restaurants. Travelling bubur ayam vendors frequently pass through residential streets in the morning selling the dish.  Origin and variations  street vendor cart frequents residential areas every morning in Jakarta. The origin of bubur ayam was derived from Chinese chicken congee. The traces of Chinese cuisine influences are the use of cakwe (youtiao), tongcay and soy sauce. Bubur ayam employs a wide range of poultry products, such as shredded chicken meat for the main dish and different dishes made with chicken offal as side delicacies. Bubur ayam is often eaten with the addition of boiled chicken egg, chicken liver, gizzard, intestines and uritan (premature chicken eggs acquired from butchered hens), served as satay. There are some variants of bubur ayam, such as bubur ayam Bandung and bubur ayam Sukabumi, both from West Java. The later variant uses raw telur ayam kampung (lit. \\"village chicken egg\\", i.e. free-range eggs) buried under the hot rice congee to allow the egg to be half-cooked, with the other ingredients on top of the rice congee. The recipe and condiments of bubur ayam served by travelling vendors and warung are also slightly different with those served in fast food establishments or hotel restaurants. Because this food is always served hot and with a soft texture, like soto ayam and nasi tim, bubur ayam is known as comfort food in Indonesian culture. The soft texture of the rice congee and boneless chicken also makes this dish suitable for young children or adults in convalescence. Because of its popularity, bubur ayam has become one of the Asia-inspired fast food menu items at McDonald's Indonesia and Malaysia, and also at Kentucky Fried Chicken Indonesia. Although almost all recipes of bubur ayam use rice, a new variation, called bubur ayam havermut, replaces rice with oats. In grocery stores, bubur ayam is also available as instant food, requiring only the addition of hot water.

Andrews' full-length portrait of Martha Washington (1878), based on a head and bust oil sketch from life by Gilbert Stuart, shows anachronistic details of costume and the American Renaissance chair.

Underwood, President of the United Confederate Veterans, commissioned Andrews to make twenty portraits of prominent Confederates for a proposed Confederate Museum in Richmond, Virginia. The project was embroiled in litigation, and eleven paintings were sold in 1910 for unpaid storage fees by a Covington, Kentucky warehouse. Most ended up in Virginia (such as that of Gen. Robert E. Lee in the Westmoreland County Courthouse), but three are in the collection of the Kentucky Museum at Western Kentucky University. The Confederate Memorial Association, led by Virginia lieutenant governor James Taylor Ellyson and financed by Thomas Fortune Ryan did build its headquarters (the Confederate Memorial Institute a/k/a \\"Battle Abbey\\") in Richmond, which is now the Virginia Historical Society.

This is because unique microclimate conditions are present, most notably the cold air is accumulated and frost areas prevail throughout the year because of the appearance of temperature inversions, and thus the conditions are created for spruce to become more competitive when compared to other tree species.

Jeff Moss, Trevor Laughlin and Gary Cosier, who had been part of the 1979 World Cup squad, were not selected ‚Äì they were replaced by Wood, Higgs, Sleep and Yardley. Peter Toohey, who had impressed with the bat in Australia's 3-2 victory over India in 1977‚Äì78, was also overlooked due to a poor 1978‚Äì79 test season. John Inverarity, the highly experienced Western Australian captain and former test player, appears never to have been considered for selection, despite a fine domestic season of cricket in 1978‚Äì79. Captaincy Although Graham Yallop had captained Australia during the 1978‚Äì79 summer, he was replaced by Kim Hughes when injured, and when Yallop returned to the side, the Australian Cricket Board decided to persist with Hughes. They also elected Hilditch as vice captain rather than Yallop. However Yallop was kept as a selector. On-tour selection panel: Hughes, Hilditch, Yallop. Replacements Alan Hurst suffered a back injury during the tour. On October 16 it was decided he would return home and Geoff Lawson was flown out as a replacement bowler during the tour.

The team was on a plane when the engine blew one hour out of Singapore and had to return. This meant the Australians arrived in India 22 hours behind schedule. The Australians spent a week in Madras to acclimatise. After arriving at Madras, Rick Darling and Jim Higgs both fell sick with stomach ailments. However the mood was optimistic and the key players seemed in good form at practice sessions. According to one report: > Yallop, in particular, is in masterly touch. His driving today was fluent > and effortless, and his teammates agree he had never been batting better. In > that sort of form, he is destined to score a lot of runs on this tour. > Hughes is always busy at the nets, offering advice and encouragement to his > players. He gave Allan Hurst a private batting clinic today and then turned > his attention to Sleep, who is gradually getting his confidence back after a > difficult beginning to the tour. North Zone vs Australia The first game of the tour was against North Zone in Srinagar, 1,600 miles from Madras. The ACB requested the game be relocated closer to Madras to reduce travel time and because Sringara was politically volatile due to the Kashmir situation, but this was knocked back as it was the first time a visiting test team had played in Kashmir and advance ticket sales were heavy. Rodney Hogg and Graeme Wood pulled out prior to the game due to illness. There was heavy security due to threats to kill the Australians from the Pakistan-based Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. Runs were scored by Hilditch (71), Hughes 70) and Yallop (83) with Hilditch and Rick Darling having a 75 run opening stand in 90 minutes. Hurst took 5-33 and Dymock 4-25 (twice dismissing Arun Lal ‚Äì who scored 99 ‚Äì on no balls). The game was drawn.Australia vs North Zone at CricketArchive South Zone vs Australia The next game took place against South Zone in Hyderabad. Hogg, Higgs and Sleep all took three wickets in South Zone's first innings. Alan Border scored 113 ‚Äì his first decent score since his debut century against Pakistan ‚Äì and Yallop made another half century; Kevin Wright made 52. The match was interrupted by rain and Australia were unable to force a victory, although Higgs and Sleep both picked up two extra wickets in South Zone's second innings. at CricketArchive Rodney Hogg had taken four wickets in all despite being pelted by fruit and other missiles during the game, resulting in Hughes asking the police to stop them. Hogg was hit by an apple core on the final day, which he threw back into the crowd. This inspired more items to be thrown at him ‚Äì a large stone hit him in the groin. It was felt by contemporary reports that Higgs out-bowled Sleep: > Sleep also took five wickets, but three of them were from loose deliveries > which a batsman of Gavaskar's class would put away. He does have the happy > knack of taking wickets with bad balls, but there are doubts about his > ability to bowl tightly enough against batsmen who were brought up playing > spin bowling. Rick Darling was cut over the left eye while fielding and needed stitches, meaning he was unable to bat at all. The selectors had wanted to experiment with Graeme Wood at six but Darling's injury meant Wood had to open. The game also saw Graeme Porter make his first class debut for Australia. First Test Rick Darling's illness was a headache for the Australian selectors ‚Äì he was first choice opener with Wood as a back up, and either Wood or Dav Whatmore to bat at six. Hughes wanted to take three pacemen into the test, Dymock, Hurst and Hogg, leaving room for one spinner ‚Äì Higgs. Eventually Darling was ruled out and Wood and Whatmore were selected, with Yardley as 12th man. India kept a similar team to that which had played in England, with Dilip Doshi making his test debut. According to Wisden: > Ironically, the Australians were better acclimatised than the home side, > having practised in these conditions for almost a week, with two pre-Test > matches. The Indians, however, had just returned from England, the Test > match starting only a week after the end of the epic fourth test at The > Oval. Besides being travel-weary, they had to adjust hurriedly to vast > differences in weather, light and pitch conditions.Wisden first test match > report at Cricinfo Australia began well with centuries to Border (162) and Hughes (100), who had a record third wicket partnership of 222. The other Australians batted less well (although several made starts), with Doshi taking 6-103. India scored 425 in reply, with Kapil Dev making 83 off 73 balls; Jim Higgs took 7-143. Hogg made 2-85. According to Wisden: > The presence of Hogg in the Australian attack presumably influenced the > preparation of a pitch slower than usual at Chepauk. As it was the Indians > were hardly disconcerted by Hogg who, apart from being unable to achieve any > pace, had immense trouble in keeping his front foot behind the popping > crease. The bowler to test the Indian batting was Higgs, who was remarkably > tidy for a leg-spinner... suffering only at the hands of Kapil Dev. All the Australian bowlers struggled in the heat, and Higgs at times struggled to grip the ball; Hogg was also plagued with no balls. Border and Yallop both bowled and Yallop took a wicket. Australia responded well in the second innings at first, with Hilditch and Border scoring half centuries as they went to 1-103. However a collapse saw Australia crash to 7-175, a lead of only a 140 with a session and a half to go. \\"When I got out I thought that was it\\", admitted Hughes later. However Geoff Dymock and Rodney Hogg held out for an hour, then the match was washed out with rain and ended in a draw.1st Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras - match drawn Hughes later said he felt Australia were lucky to draw. \\"We were in a golden position on the first day, and half way through the second day, but we blew it\\", he said. \\"We should have got ourselves into a position where we couldn't lose, and then kept the pressure on India... Obviously we'll be paying a lot of attention to our batting. I thought the top-order batsmen were very disappointing\\". Second Test There were some doubts the second test would start as scheduled due to a monsoon. Rick Darling replaced Whatmore in the side, with Wood dropping down to number six. Bruce Yardley came in for Dymock. Shivlav Ladal made his test debut for India. Australia won the toss and batted, with Hilditch and Hughes scoring half centuries. However they collaposed to be 5-294 to 333 all out. India's innings was marked by problems involving Rodney Hogg. According to Wisden: > Hogg could not work up speed, and at the start of the Indian innings again > had trouble landing his front foot in the right place. After being no balled > seven times in five overs delivered from different ends, Hogg lost his > temper on the second evening and kicked down the stumps. The incident would > have fouled the atmosphere had Hughes not taken prompt action, tendering an > immediate apology to the umpire and persuading Hogg to express his regret at > the end of the day's play.Wisden second test report Bob Merriman later announced that it was decided no disciplinary action would be taken against Hogg. He wound up with figures of 0-118 off 32 overs, the first time he had failed to take a wicket in a test. Hurst took 0-93; Yardley had figures of 4-107, but was too ill to bowl towards the end as India declared at 5-457. Rick Darling had left the field while Australia was fielding and was too ill to open so Wood took his place. Australia were 3-77 in reply, 47 behind India's first innings total, at tea on the fifth day, when a rain storm caused the game to be abandoned. Yadav ended up taking 7-87 for the match.2nd Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore Australia vs Central Zone Australia then travelled to Nagpur for a tour game against Central Zone. Peter Sleep threw his name into consideration with 5-71 and 61 not out; Darling (82) and Whatmore (60) also found form in a drawn game.Australia vs Central Zone at CricketArchive Hogg however only took 1-39 and 1-13 and there were doubts raised about whether he should be picked ‚Äì the first time this had happened in his career. \\"It's something new for him and it will be important for us to see how he handles it\\", said Hughes. However Hurst's back was playing up and he was advised to rest; this made Hogg's selection more imperative. Third Test Australia kept faith with Hogg for the third test, bringing in Dymock to replace Hurst. India won the toss and elected to bat; they were 1-201 but the Australian attack fired and they were dismissed for 271, Dymock taking 5-99 and Hogg 4-66 (though he was still no balled 13 times in 15 overs). Darling had more health issues, injuring his shoulder while fielding and having to leave the ground; it turned out to be sprained, and Darling batted down the order, with Bruce Yardley opening. Australia were unable to press the advantage although they managed to score 304, led by Yallop (89), Hughes (50) and Darling (59); for a time it seemed Darling was not going to be able to bat but he decided to try and ended up lasting three hours. India batted well in their second innings making 311. Dymock took 7/67 but Australia dropped a number of key catches which later proved crucial.Wisden third test report accessed 15 December 2014 Australia were set the task of getting 279 in 310 minutes. Alan Border was suffering from flu so Yallop batted at three (Border came in at six). The Australians collapsed and were all out for 125, Dev and Yadav taking four wickets each.3rd Test at Modi Stadium, Kanpur - India won by 153 runs To make things worse for Australia, Bruce Yardley was injured when a Kapil Dev yorker struck him on the big toe of the left foot, causing him to swell up and putting him in doubt for the fourth test. Australia vs West Zone The next game was against West Zone. Hughes scored 126 but the rest of the batsmen failed. West Zone were dismissed for 217 with Sleep and Higgs taking three wickets each ‚Äì and Graeme Wood a career- best 3-18. Australia made 9-143 in their second innings (Whatmore 41), then Border and Higgs each took three wickets as they almost bowled Australia to victory, the game ending with West Zone 7-95.Australia vs West Zone at CricketArchive Alan Hurst had returned to the Australian side for the game but it became apparent the injury was getting worse. It was decided that he should be sent home after the fourth test and be replaced by Geoff Lawson. Hughes: > He really struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's > very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but > it's no use now. He might have to have a complete rest if he wants to do > himself justice. There's no point in him staying in India if he can't bowl. > He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play > him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do > himself permanent damage. He hadn't done any work at all for a week, and > he's now as unfit as he has ever been in his career. Bob Merriman said Hurst was: > Bitterly disappointed. It's a shame for this to hap pen to Alan. He's no > sloucher. I don't think he's ever come off a cricket ground in his life. He > will be staying with us throughout the fourth Test. With Bruce Yardley also > injured, Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's the > sort of person he is. Fourth Test Australia replaced Bruce Yardley with Peter Sleep. Gavaskar (dropped on 13), Viswanath and Sharma all scored centuries as India made 7-510, with Dymock taking 4-135. Australia made 298 in response due to fine innings from Whatmore (77) and Wright (55); Kapil Dev took 5-82; Graham Yallop had to bat in a different position due to illness. India enforced the follow on. Australia managed to bat to safety with a total of 413 with good innings from Hilditch (85), Hughes (40), Border (46), Whatmore (54) and Sleep (64). The partnership of Whatmore and Sleep in particular ‚Äì 76 off 102 minutes ‚Äì was especially crucial. Both Wright and Higgs were severely ill due to stomach upsets.4th Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi - match drawn Hughes called this effort \\"the best all-round team effort from any side that I've ever played in, especially considering all the circumstances\\". East Zone vs Australia Australia played East Zone in Cuttack with Geoff Lawson joining the team; Kevin Wright was rested for the first time on tour, with Graham Yallop taking the gloves. Australia scored 5-160 (Yallop 81 not out) when Hughes declared; East Zone were dismissed for 126 in return; Australia were 8-119 when Hughes declared again, 50 minutes before tea. This gave East Zone a day and a half to score 153 runs. Hughes explained the generosity of this declaration by stating he was unhappy with the quality of the Cuttack pitch, saying it was one of the worst he had ever played on, and thus of limited use to his team; the idea was to win in two games to give the side more time to prepare for the test match in Calcutta. It did not work out that way; East Zone were 4-111 by the end of that day and ended up winning the game by four wickets (two catches were dropped). Fifth Test Australia made only one change for the fifth test team, bringing Bruce Yardley back for Peter Sleep. Initially the Australians were reluctant to use a still-injured Yardley but a look at the spin friendly Eden Gardens pitch made them change their minds. Hughes: > It's a certainty that Yardley is going to have to play on this wicket. > Obviously he will have some pain, but he will not do any irreparable damage. > The results of another x-ray on the toe have given him cause for optimism > and he is pleased in his own mind. He has experienced some discomfort in the > nets, but it's not enough to stop him playing. He's a must in the team and > I'm sure he can do the job. Australia batted extremely well in their first innings, making 442 thanks to Yallop (167) (as opener), Hughes (92), Border (54), and Yardley (61). Indian managed 347 in reply, collapsing from 2-256 with Yardley getting 4-91. Australia were 5-81 in reply in one stage, in danger of losing, but Hughes started hitting out and Australia added 70 in 72 minutes. Hughes declared (he was on 64 not out), leaving India to get 246 runs in 247 minutes. Geoff Dymock took four wickets and at one stage India were 4-123 but Yashpal Sharma and Rao dug in and the game ended drawn, with them 4-200. According to Wisden: > Although the ball had turned on the fourth day ‚Äì a factor in Hughes's > declaration ‚Äì the heavy roller produced a calmer pitch on the final day. > Lacking in bounce, it was of little use to the wrist-spin of Higgs, and > Australia's only finger-spinner, Yardley, failed to reproduce his form of > the Indian first innings. Wisden fifth test match report 5th Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta - match drawn Sixth Test Australia made one change for the sixth test, bringing back Sleep for Bruce Yardley, after the latter failed a fitness test. India won the toss and decided to bat, making 8-458, with both Gavaskar and Kirmani scoring centuries. Graham Yallop and Sleep both had to leave the ground during the day due to illness. Australia were dismissed for 160, with only Yallop (60) offering much resistance. According to Wisden, \\"the Australians were upset by two umpiring decisions during this innings. Hilditch was aggrieved at being given run out and Hughes was even less pleased to be given out caught at silly point. There was a red patch on his shirt-sleeve to provide evidence that justice had not been done.\\"Wisden sixth test report accessed 16 December 2014 Australia were 2-149 in their second innings (Border 61, Hughes 80) but then collapsed to be all out for 198 and lost by an innings and 100 runs.6th Test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay - India won by an innings and 100 runs Wisden later called Hughes' knock \\"one of the finest innings played against Indian bowling in recent times.\\" During the second innings, Dev felled Rick Darling with a bouncer, causing him to be retired hurt. Summary The tour established Kim Hughes and Allan Border as test batsmen. However it was a disappointing tour for Australian strike bowler Rodney Hogg. Hughes thought key problems were the failure of the Australian openers to get off to a good start, and dropping of crucial catches. Hughes: > Not enough of us came up to scratch... Rodney Hogg was disappointing. He > took a long while to get to grips with the conditions. We expected our > openers to play an important role, but Rick Darling, Andrew Hilditch and > Graeme Wood struggled the whole way. That was a big blow to us. In the words of Samir Chopra: > The series had many moments of personal success for Hughes' team, but the > Australians were always just a bit outgunned and outmatched, and given that > they were never very happy, the result was a foregone conclusion. Still, > they showed fight, their batsmen played spin reasonably (Border and Hughes > especially well), and their captain showed himself to be more enterprising > than his Indian counterpart. As was their wont, and still is now, India > failed to win more comprehensively against a much weaker team. Wisden summed up the tour for the Australians: > The main Australian gain of the tour was the tremendous advance made by two > batsmen, Hughes and Border. Between the first Test and the last there was a > marked development in Hughes's technique of playing spin bowling, and > happily the heavy burden of captaincy had no adverse effect on his > batting... He passed the half-century mark in every Test but one and could > certainly have made more runs had he not batted as positively and > purposefully as he did. Border... started the series more strongly than he > finished it. But as his form declined, another left-hander, Yallop, came > into his own. The most experienced player in the side, Yallop was at his > best when batting conditions were most difficult. In the last two Tests, he > opened the innings and filled the r√¥le with distinction. If he did not make > an earlier impact on the series it was partly because, more than once, he > was dismissed in unfortunate ways. A major weakness of the Australian > batting was its fragility at the top of the order... The best Australian > opening partnership in the entire series was one of 32. Yet this was not > Australia's only weakness, nor the most prominent. It was the lack of depth > to their bowling and their generally poor out-cricket that put them at such > a disadvantage. On the few occasions when their bowlers rose to any heights, > they were let down by the fielders, with many more slip chances going down > than were held. Fitness problems also were acute. Back in Australia, the next test played was against the West Indies. Eight of the twelve players selected were from World Series Cricket, including Greg Chappell as captain, but Hughes, Border, Hogg and Dymock were kept in the side and Hughes was appointed vice-captain.

The film was presented in world premi√®re at the Toronto International Film Festival 2011, then at the Festival de Cine Italiano in Madrid, at the London Italian Film Festival 2012 and at the Lavazza Italian Film Festival 2012 in Sydney. Plot The first scenes of the film are set in the historical center of the town of Termoli. A young illegal immigrant called Ivan is looking for a job. He is a bricklayer and lives in a small flat with his old and sick father. Precisely in with the intention to find a job he sets off to the Isole Tremiti, Apulia, but cannot not return as planned and had to extend his sojourn. There he meets two people who are going to help him. One is Don Enzo, an uncommon priest who lives in a small house and takes care of his bees. The other is Martina, a young woman who, since her daughter's death, has closed herself in silence, and lives in Don Enzo's house, her former tutor. Martina and Ivan become friends, and even don Enzo starts to feel some sympathy for the youngster. The three protagonists have nothing in common, except for one thing: they live in isolation because they are different from other people. It is not by chance that the story takes place in an isolated place, in fact on islands. But precisely the fact of being different is at the origin of the mutual interest that over time becomes sympathy and friendship. In defining the characters the director underscores the difference that often generates loneliness but may also bring people closer to one another. In a time where migration is a worldwide phenomenon Chiantini's analysis is interesting. That description of the social relationship is completed by a last character, Father Enzo's sister. She is a selfish and greedy woman who, from the first instant, distrusts the young foreigner mainly because she is interested in the property of the Father. She symbolises the world around which is united against Ivan and Martina.

He was the Governor of Styria from 1253 to 1254 and high judge of Styria from 1276 to 1279.  Life  He was a son of Count Ulrich II (d. 1249) and the last Countess of Lebenau. He played a prominent r√¥le in the political life in Styria in the chaotic period between the death of Frederick II, the last Duke of Austria from the House of Babenberg in 1246 and the death of Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1278. Henry's role was much more prominent than that of his brothers Ulrich, Bernard and Siegfried. In the dispute between Philip of Spanheim, who had been elected as Archbishop of Salzburg, and Count Meinhard I of Gorizia and Tyrol, Henry and his brother Bernard initially sided with Philip of Spanheim, in order to protect their fiefs in Carinthia, Styria and Salzburg. A deed of their alliance has survived, which was sealed on 1 June 1250 in Fohnsdorf; a number of vassals of the Pfannbergs are named as guarantors. Their stance in later years is less clear. Henry was bribed by King Bela IV of Hungary, who attempted to make his son Duke of Styria. In 1252, Ulrich sided with Ottokar, who was ruling Austria by then. Ulrich allegedly acted on behalf of all four brothers. In 1253 Ottokar had settled himself in Styria. He appointed Henry as governor of Styria and returned to Bohemia. Bela IV then attacked Bohemia, and in the war that followed, Ottokar's father, King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, was killed. The war was ended by the Treaty of Buda of 1254, in which Ottokar ceded Styria to Bela.  Marriage and issue  In 1260, Henry married Agnes of Plain-Hardegg, the daughter (or sister) of Count Conrad III (1230-1260). Agnes' mother was Euphemia of Ortenburg. Agnes is last mentioned in a record dated 10 April 1298 in Ehrenhausen, when she donated her dower, namely Loschental Castle in the Lavant Valley and the tower in Lavam√ºnd with all appurtenances, to the Archbishopric of Salzburg, in return for the archbishop praying for the salvation of her soul. Henry and Agnes had three children: * Herman (d. 1287), married Elisabeth, a daughter of Ulrich II of Heunburg and Agnes of Baden, and secondly, after 1297, with Henry II of Hohenlohe * Rainold (d. 1292), abbot of Rein Abbey (1280-1292) * Ulrich IV (1261 - after 1318), married Margaret (1268 - 8 December 1292), another daughter of Ulrich II of Heunburg and Agnes of Baden  References  * Karlmann Tangl: Die Grafen von Pfannberg, in: Archiv f√ºr Kunde √∂sterreichischer Geschichts-Quellen, vol. 18, Vienna, 1857 * Othmar Pickl: Geschichte des Marktes Frohnleiten, Graz, 1956 * (Article about the Pfannberg family) Counts of Pfannberg 13th-century births Year of birth unknown 1282 deaths 13th-century Austrian people ","title":"Henry, Count of Pfannberg"},{"id":"36018058","text":"McKelway is a surname.

Youth and early career Fredy Mascarenhas was born on 11 April 1981 in Cuncolim, Goa, India. He started his liking of the game football at a young age after seeing his neighbour and good friend Siano Fernandes who played for Dempo.

Unlike many other condottieri of the day, who often changed sides, he served Venice almost exclusively throughout his thirty-year military career. During most of this period Venice was constantly at war with one or more of the neighboring states in northern Italy. Early years Taddeo d'Este was born around the last decade of the fourteenth century in Este, the second son of Obizzo II d'Este, of the younger branch of the family that ruled Ferrara. His mother belonged to the noble family of Collalto. Taddeo became a mercenary at an early age, fighting for Venice, and gave the republic his loyalty for the next thirty years during the wars in which the city struggled to gain territory in the Terraferma, on the mainland. However, he was never given independent command for any length of time. Friuli and Istria 1414‚Äì1422 Taddeo d'Este was active in the struggle for territory between Venice and the Patriarch of Aquileia. In 1414 Taddeo led a squad of fifteen lances (cavalrymen) in a fight at Zadar against the armies of Sigismund of Luxembourg. The next year he was given permission to return to Este to look after family affairs, since his father had just died. When the truce with Sigismund broke down, in April 1417 he was sent back at the head of 50 lances. In September 1418 he was leading a force of 70 lances in the village of Brugnera, a defensive position along the Treviso-Udine line. In November 1419, with 100 horsemen, he was sent to defend Cividale del Friuli against Hungarian troops under Louis of Teck, the Patriarch of Aquileia. He organized the defense successfully, then managed to break out and defeat the Hungarians in open battle. By the end of the month he was able to raise the Venetian banner over the castles of Gorizia and Duino. By June 1420 most of Friuli had been conquered and another truce had been arranged with Sigismund. Taddeo returned on leave to Venice and in September married Magdalene, daughter of Filippo Arcelli, governor general of the Friuli army. He was required to return to Friuli immediately after his marriage. In January 1421 he was dispatched to Istria. When Arcelli became ill and retired to Padua to regain his health, d'Este was appointed commander of the troops. After recovering, Arcelli returned to Istria and resumed command, but was wounded in battle and died in July 1421. Taddeo d'Este again took command. He damaged the castle of Sanvincenti to the east of Rovigno. He took the Pietrapelosa castle in Istria in August 1421 and during the next few months defeated the army of Aquileia; Istria became divided between the Republic of Venice and the Habsburg County of Pazin. Although Taddeo d'Este was recognized as the most senior of the commanders after Arcelli's death, he was not officially the leader. By the autumn of 1421 the Venetian republic had imposed economy measures on the army, reducing troop levels to their lowest in a long time, with only 400 cavalry. However, in May 1422 an increase in forces was allowed. Milan, Aquileia, Bologna 1422‚Äì1437 Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan (1412‚Äì1447) By early 1422 the conquest of Istria was complete. Taddeo returned home, retaining some of his men but not engaging in warfare for several years. He used the time to reorganize his estates and to buy houses and land in the Este countryside and the city of Padua. In March 1426 a new conflict broke out between Venice and Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan. Taddeo was asked to lead a company of 100 lances. He was one of the first to enter the fortress of Brescia when it was captured. When the peace of Ferrara in April 1428 brought temporary peace, for a while Taddeo fought in the service of the Pope, helping with the recapture of Bologna. In 1431 Taddeo d'Este was again fighting for the republic against the Patriarch of Aquileia, who with the encouragement of Milan had raised a force of over 6,000 German and Hungarian troops with which to try to recover part of his former domain. Taddeo was sent to Friuli, where he engaged in defensive actions against superior forces until the main Venetian force arrived and decisively and permanently defeated the partiarch at Rosazzo. In November 1432 Taddeo d'Este was defeated in Lombardy, captured and taken to Milan. He was released in April of the next year in exchange for a huge ransom after peace had been arranged between Venice and Milan. The Venetians confirmed Taddeo as leader of 200 cavalry and gave him command of the garrison of Orzi Nuovi in Lombardy. In May 1434 his son Bertoldo was born, destined to follow in his father's footsteps as a soldier for Venice. In August 1434 Taddeo d'Este was engaged in fighting in Romagna with the troops of Bologna, and was taken prisoner, being released after the intervention of the Marquess of Ferrara. In March 1435 he was given the task of foiling an attempt by Marsilio da Carrara to capture Padua. After he had succeeded, in April 1435 he was admitted to the ranks of the Venetian nobility, with his children and heirs, and admitted to the Great Council of Venice. The Venetians awarded him a palace in their city of Padua. Final decade 1438‚Äì1448 Francesco Sforza (1401‚Äì1466) In 1438 war with Milan broke out again. Taddeo d'Este and Francesco Barbero conducted a long and gallant defense of Brescia against Milanese troops under Piccinino. Gattamelata broke out, making a skilled escape via mountain routes, leaving Taddeo with just 1,000 men to conduct the defense. The siege of Brescia lasted until December 1438, when Gattamelata made a feint that drew Piccinino away. The fighting continued, and in September 1439 d'Este was forced to surrender to greatly superior forces and was imprisoned in Peschiera. In 1441 d'Este was back in Venice attending the celebrations of the marriage of Jacopo, son of Doge Francesco Foscari. In the Piazza San Marco his company competed for lavish prizes in lengthy tournaments with the companies of the condottieri Francesco Sforza and Gattamelata. His first wife having died, he married again in 1442 to Margherita Pio. In the 1440s Leonello and Taddeo d'Este were challenged by the canons of S. Giacomo, Monselice, who claimed they had been levying tithes in the parish of S. Maria, Solesino, by force for several years. In June 1443 Taddeo d'Este was commanded to take his company of 800 cavalry to Ravenna, where he placed himself under the command of Francesco Sforza, then serving as captain general of the anti-Papal league. In June 1445, acting as commander of the army but without the formal title, Taddeo was sent to Bologna with 1,000 cavalry and 400 infantry. The next year he managed to arrange for a part of the Bolognese forces to transfer to Venice, and after some further fighting was able to bring the war with Bologna to a close. He then had to return to Lombardy where a renewed struggle with Milan had begun. In 1447 d'Este seized and held Piacenza for Venice. He defended the town with 2,000 lances, 2,000 infantry and 6,000 armed citizens. The town was besieged by Milanese forces under Francesco Sforza. In addition to Sforza's men the Milanese army had 10,000 soldiers and the condottieri under leaders such as Francesco Piccinino, Guidaccio Manfredi, Luigi dal Verme and others had 15,000 cavalry and infantry. The walls were broken down by cannon fire, and flooding of the river Po meant that boats could approach the city walls. After fierce fighting, Taddeo d'Este, Alberto Scotto and the Venetian governor Gherardo Dandolo were forced to surrender and were taken captive. The town was thrown open to pillage and the inhabitants were treated with great cruelty. Due to his personal friendship with Sforza, d'Este was soon released. Taddeo d'Este died suddenly while attempting to take Mozzanica on 21 June 1448. His state funeral was held in Brescia. His body was returned to Este, where it was buried in the family tomb in the church of S. Francesco. His male line died out in 1463.

He was a popular commentator on radio, and once had the distinction of having a scheduled broadcast censored. He was a regular commentator on the ABC's Notes on the News programme. One campaign for which Rivett is particularly remembered was the \\"Stuart Case\\". Max Stuart, an aborigine, was convicted of rape and murder of a child at Ceduna, South Australia and sentenced to death. The News had been critical of the handling of the case, arguing that Stuart was not getting a fair trial, and urged the Playford government to set up a Royal Commission. The Commission on 3 December 1959 found the case against Stuart wholly justified, and seven weeks later The News and Rivett were tried on nine charges including seditious libel. The jury trial was held over ten days from 7 March 1960 with Dr. John Bray representing the accused, who were found \\"not guilty\\" on all but one charge. At this stage the Government dropped the case, perhaps because of the adverse publicity it was giving Playford's Liberal and Country League government. Stuart's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was released on parole in 1973. In 1960 he was sacked, on generous terms, by Sir Keith Murdoch's son Rupert, who considered him unreliable and uncontrollable. He soon found employment at the International Press Institute in Zurich but returned to Melbourne in 1963, where he worked as a freelance journalist, featuring in The Canberra Times and Nation Review. In 1973 he was elected president of the Melbourne Press Club and was succeeded in 1976 by Keith Dunstan.Chapter Two: Lunch at $5 a head  Melbourne Press Club He died at his Camberwell home, of a heart attack, on 5 October 1977 and was cremated.

Based on a story by Jack Natteford, the film is about the son of a Southeastern cattleman who becomes entangled in a war between the cattlemen and \\"turpentiners\\" who make their living harvesting pine tree sap. Plot In a large pine forest in the American Southeast called Pine Ridge, a feud is ongoing between cattlemen who want to burn the forest for grazing land, and \\"turpentiners\\" who make their living harvesting pine sap. The cattlemen suspect that the turpentiners are rustling their cattle, not knowing that the man organizing the rustling is Len Parker (LeRoy Mason), a cattleman. Arthur Autry is among the cattlemen who believe they should raid the turpentiners and burn them out. Arthur's fair-minded son, Gene Autry (Gene Autry), opposes the action, and is in love with Milly Baynum (Betty Bronson), the stepdaughter of the leader of the turpentiners. When Gene warns the turpentiners of the upcoming raid, his good intentions backfire as the turpentiners fight back and his father is wounded. Believing that Gene was fighting against the cattlemen, his father disowns him, and Gene leaves his home. Two years later, Gene returns to Pine Ridge as the star of Colonel Frog Millhouse's Wild West show. Although glad to see Milly again, Gene is distraught to learn that his father is now destitute after his cattle were secretly stolen by Parker. After paying all of his father's bills, Gene learns from Milly that Arthur's cattle have been grazing in a distant meadow, and when Gene investigates, he is captured by two of Parker's henchmen. Parker orders his henchmen to replace Arthur's cattle with his own and take the stolen animals to Fox Canyon. Back in town, Frog waits anxiously for Gene's arrival so the show can begin. One of Parker's henchmen tells Frog about Gene being captured. Frog is forced to start the show using a double for Gene. Believing that Gene has escaped, Parker orders his right-hand man, Jeff Galloway (Jack Dougherty), to kill him, and Galloway shoots the double. Meanwhile, Gene, who has escaped his captors, arrives back in town and learns about the crime. He tells Sheriff Martin (Henry Hall) to meet him at Arthur's ranch. When he arrives, Gene discovers that his father is dead, and rushing over to the Baynum cabin, Gene finds Milly's stepfather Bayliss has also been murdered. Because Bayliss was bludgeoned with Gene's gun, which Parker's men had stolen, Sheriff Martin arrests Gene for the murder and takes him to jail. Believing that Gene will be set free because he is a cattleman, the turpentiners arrive at the jail intending to lynch him. Frog, Martin, and Milly prevent the lynching and Gene escapes. He goes to Parker's office, where he finds a receipt for the sale of his father's cattle. While Gene attempts to take Parker and Galloway to the sheriff, a gun battle between the cattlemen and turpentiners breaks out in the street and Parker, who killed both Arthur and Bayliss, gets away. Gene and his fellow entertainers chase after Parker and his men, and while the show people round up the gang, Gene apprehends Parker who is taken to jail. With the feud now ended, Gene and Milly decide to get married.

Property and casualty guaranty funds step in to pay the covered claims (which would otherwise go partially or entirely unpaid) of policyholders of an insolvent insurer at levels determined by state law. This ensures policyholders and claimants at greatest risk are protected from the most severe consequences of an insurer's failure. Colorado's guaranty fund statute summarizes the purpose of guaranty funds. The statute states that Colorado's guaranty fund \\"provide(s) a mechanism for the payment of covered claims under certain insurance policies, to avoid excessive delay in payment and financial loss to claimants or policyholders because of the insolvency of an insurer, to assist in the detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies, and to provide an association to assess the cost of such protection among insurers.\\" Most guaranty funds were created in the 1960s when academics, state insurance commissioners, and lawmakers sought ways to provide new levels of insurance policyholder protection. Guaranty funds are active in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. State laws require that all licensed property and casualty insurance companies belong to the guaranty funds in every state where the companies are licensed to do business. A guaranty fund system also exists for the life, health, and annuity insurance industries, but operates independently from the property and casualty system.

She remained a popular actress throughout the 1920s, working with directors such as Reinhold Sch√ºnzel, Rudolf Biebrach, Hans Werckmeister, and Adolf E. Licho. Her greatest successes were The Brigantine of New York (1924), A Woman for 24 Hours (1925), and the French-German film The Good Reputation (1926). Neumann's career began to decline after the advent of sound film, and her final screen appearance was in Die Liebesfiliale (1931). According to Neumann, she ended her career as an actress due to a lengthy divorce proceeding which lasted from 1929 to 1932. After her retirement from the screen, Neumann continued to write screenplays under the names C.H. Diller or Charlotte Diller, and entered a creative partnership with her husband, director Walter Wassermann, which lasted from 1935 until his death in 1944. She is credited with writing 24 films, including The Beggar Student (1936), Men Without a Fatherland (1937), Sergeant Berry (1938), and Kora Terry (1940). After World War II, Neumann wrote two more screenplays, her final being Man m√º√üte nochmal zwanzig sein (1958). Neumann died on 26 February 1977 in Gai√üach.

The cyclotron type proton accelerator \\"CYCLONE-30\\" has a variable beam energy between 15 and 30 MeV and variable beam current up to 1.2 mA. It was designed, manufactured and installed by Belgian Ion Beam Applications S.A. (IBA). The cyclotron cost 11.6 million EUR. With the cyclotron, four beamlines can be generated, three beamlines for radioisotope production and one for research and development works. With the proton bombardment following radioisotopes are produced in three separate target rooms: * Indium-111, gallium-67, thallium-201 on solid target material, * Fluorine-18 on liquid target material, * Iodine-123 on evaporated target material. These radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals produced from those radioisotopes are used for the diagnosis and therapy of diseases like cancer, neurological disorder, brain physiology and pathology as well as coronary artery disease. By producing radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, the facility conducts research work in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, food, biotechnology, animal husbandry and heath physics.

These letters were sent from the early 19th century till the 20th century. They were initially delivered by men known as zui-kheh () literally \\"Water Traveller\\", who travelled frequently between Southeast Asia and the Teochew region for business. Towards the end of the 19th century, delivery of the Teochew Letters became a full-fledged industry, known as the Qiaopi industry (). Qiaopi agencies in Southeast Asia collected the letters and remittances from the migrant workers and sent them to their corresponding partner in Swatow. The agencies in Swatow then distributed the letters to local agencies located in the counties and villages of the Teochew region. The men employed to hand-deliver the letters and money to the families were known as phoe-kha (), literally the \\"Feet of the Letters\\". The Qiaopi industry ended in 1979 when the government in China ordered its functions to be transferred to Bank of China. Family correspondence combined with remittance was not unique to the Teochews. Other groups of overseas Chinese, including the Hokkien, the Cantonese and the Hakka, also used this method to communicate with their families. The Qiaopi agencies of the different groups served only their own community circle and their services did not overlap. An estimate of 170,000 Qiaopi letters have been collected by researchers and private collectors. The majority are Teochew Letters. The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics, based in Swatow, has a collection of 120,000 Teochew Letters, consisting of both originals and copies. The Teochew Letters has immense historical value. It is an archive of the cultural and collective historical experiences of the Teochew people. Its contents reflect society at all levels, touching on international relations, national issues, and details of daily life important to families. As such, the information they contain bear intrinsic value for further research, as they are able to authenticate and supplement contemporary written history.  Terms  Qiaopi () literally means the \\"Letter of the Overseas Chinese\\", with \\"phoe\\" () being the Southern Min expression for \\"letter\\". The term has sometimes been translated as Overseas Remittance Mail or Money Remittance MailChoon Koshpasharin (2008)Money remittance mail and overseas Chinese in S.E. AsiaBangkok : Xu Maochun. but these fail to capture the cultural aspect of the artefacts.  Application for UNESCO Memory of the World Register  As part of the larger Archive of Overseas Remittance Mails, the Teochew Letters were added to the China Archival Heritage Register in 2010. Together with the Qiaopi collection of Jiangmen, Meizhou and Fujian, the Teochew Letters were included into the Asia/Pacific Regional Memory of the World (MOW) Register on 16 May 2012. Higher recognition is being sought through ongoing submission for inclusion in the prestigious UNESCO Memory of the World Register in 2013. To increase general awareness of the Teochew Letters and to promote the UNESCO Memory of the World Register application efforts, The Museum of Overseas Remittance Mail Relics launched an online museum for the Teochew Letters in June 2012.

It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1921. It is found in Zimbabwe and the South African provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and Limpopo. The wingspan is 4‚Äì5 mm for males and about 4.5 mm for females. The forewings of the males are grey brown, slightly irrorate (sprinkled), caused by the scales being dark tipped and paler at the base. There is a silver-white pattern on the forewings, consisting of a triangular dorsal spot at one-fourth from the base, a smaller spot at the costa, sometimes joined to the dorsal spot as a narrow fascia. There is a second triangular dorsal spot at one-half, reaching almost to the middle of the wing and a triangular costal spot just beyond the middle, always separate. The hindwings are pale grey. Females have the scales almost uniformly dark fuscous with a purplish tinge, resulting in darker, velvety wing colour and contrasting silvery-white pattern. The first costal and dorsal spots are always joined to form a narrow fascia, wider at the dorsum. The second dorsal and costal spots are as in males. There are probably multiple overlapping generations. The larvae feed on Rhoicissus digitata, Rhoicissus revoilii, Rhoicissus tomentosa and Cissus cornifolia. The larvae mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a much contorted narrow gallery with all convolutions close to each other, hardly leaving leaf tissue between them. Later, the mine enlarges into an irregular wide gallery or a blotch. The frass is black throughout, clumped and almost filling the gallery, but with space between the clumps. Mines are very often clustered in groups. The larva cuts out an elliptic case of about 3 mm long and 2 mm wide.

In 2011, the company mined 108.2 million metric tonnes of coal and is planning to produce 120 million metric tonnes in 2012. In addition to the production in China, the company is developing a coal mine in British Columbia, Canada, and plans to expand to Australia, Burma, and Cambodia. In March 2012, the company's subsidiary Linyi Mining Group made a take-over bid for Australian coal company Rocklands Richfield. In the Yining mining area, the companies subsidiary Xinwen Mining Group together with Australian Linc Energy has planned to develop a coal gasification project with a capacity of of syngas per year. The company's subsidiary Longkou Mining Group is the only company in China mining coal beneath the seabed. The mining is carried out at the Beizao Underwater Coal Mine in Bohai Bay to the north of Shandong Peninsula. Oil shale Oil shale is produced as a coal mining byproduct by company's subsidiary Longkou Mining Group. It operates shale oil plant which is equipped with 40 Fushun retorts. The shale oil production is about 120,000 tonnes per year and the planned full capacity is 200,000 tonnes of shale oil per year. The company also plans to utilize Enefit-280 technology. In addition, the company plans to burn shale char mixed with particulate oil shale in fluidized bed combustion for power generation, and the shale ash would be utilized for production of building material. Power generation The company owns several coal and oil shale-fired power stations. In addition, it plans to develop nuclear, wind and solar power.

For more equipment in use with the Royal Engineers, see Modern equipment of the British Army. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Air Portable Ferry Bridge GP The Air Portable Ferry Bridge GP is usually transported on 8 x DROPS NATO pallets but it can be changed to allow it to be flown forward underslung beneath a support helicopter. The system has been used on operations in Afghanistan the equipment has 5 versions. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Over Bridge An APFB (OB) can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Section. If required it can be transported on Trailers. The trailers can then be underslung underneath a helicopter or can be towed by long wheelbase land rovers or other vehicles once on the ground. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Single Storey The APBF Single Storey (SS) can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Troop. It is generally transported on NATO pallets. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Single Storey Reinforced (SSR) This version can be constructed with reinforcing link to enable a greater load to be carried. however it does increase the overall weight and the completely of the whole bridge. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Ferry The Air Portable Ferry Bridge (APFB) Ferry (FY) is a self-propelled roll-on, roll-off ferry. It has its own wheels so can be towed by vehicles like land rovers and some other vehicles like APC's. The bridge is constructed on a standard frame and then boomed onto six pontoons then it is bolted on The pontoons have two water propulsion units, which are used to steer the ferry when it is in water. The engines that are used to power the propulsion units are also used to operate the hydraulic rams, which raise and lower the two ramps. Air Portable Ferry Bridge Safety Line System All APFB systems include a safety line system designed to protect the user in the event of a fall from the bridge. It uses a static line and fall arresters attached to the demolition harness. It is designed for use during ramping, decking and positioning kerbs. Logistic Support Bridging Logistic Support Bridging (LSB) The LSB is usually constructed with the help of a crane, it provides a larger load capacity than Close Support Bridging or General Support Bridging. One standard unit contains all the components needed to build, launch and dismantle a bridge. The modular design of the equipment means it can be constructed in a large number of different configurations, allowing the system to be used for a wide range of load and spans. The LSB can be deployed on main supply routes to provide new bridges, replace damaged bridges or to upgrade smaller bridges for heavier traffic like tanks and heavy equipment. The LSB overcomes limitations in width, span, capacity and fatigue that is associated with many other systems in the RE use The LSB can be built by hand, but where cranes and other mechanical handling equipment are available, they are used to reduces the time it takes to build and also the number of trained personal needed. Bridge components can be transported using DROPS (NATO) flat racks and ISO shipping containers. The bridge can be constructed by a Royal Engineer Section; when mechanical equipment is used, without it can take up to three sections. Once constructed a LSB tends to remain in situ for far longer periods than either a CSB or a GSB, one bridge in Iraq remained in use for three years. The bridge has a width (roadway) of 4.2m and can be built with sloping or level access ramps depending on the site. Logistic Support Bridge (LSB) Fixed Pier The pier consists of 2 towers that are constructed from standard bridging panels with the addition of some other key components. Both piers are built separately, the pier caps are then moved into position to form a platform on which rollers are secured to allow the bridge to be boomed across a river. For this it is important to have a crane. It is used when the river banks are too steep to allow the bridge to just be swung across. It has also been used when the bank of the river is not strong enough to support simpler constructions. BR 90 Bridging BR-90 GSB The BR-90 GSB is the primary general support bridge. It uses the same modular components as the Close Support Bridges. A standard bridge set is carried, launched and recovered from 3 specialist vehicles (1 x Automated Bridge Launching Equipment (ABLE) and 2 x Bridging Vehicles (BV). Up to 44m of bridge can be built using this system, although only 32m is possible with the 3 vehicle combination. To construct a single bridge the following equipment is used: One ABLE vehicle carries the launch and recovery equipment as well as some bridge parts. The ABLE places a launch rail over the gap and then booms the bridge across, while the bridge is assembled it slowly launches meaning that the bridge requires no pre planning or surveying. the system that is used to launch the bridge can also retrieve the bridge as well. Two Bridging Vehicles (BV) carry the remainder of the bridge set. Each BV has a large flatbed body with a HIAB crane permanently mounted behind the vehicle cab. Each BV normally carries either the left or the right side (although they are identical). They are then added during the build using the HIAB cranes. To build the bridge, the ABLE builds its launch rail across the gap and the BVs park either side of it, and, simultaneously, pass the bridge panels onto the ABLEs building platform. When the bridge is at the required length, it is lowered onto the ground and disconnected from the launch rail. Finally, centre pieces are fitted and also curbs. Long Span Equipment (LSE) The Long Span Equipment enables a bridge with a greater load capacity to be constructed. The bridge is constructed using standard BR90 components and then a link reinforcing system is added allowing about 3x the weight to be carried. 2 x extra Bridging Vehicles (BV) are required to transport the long span components. Most bridges built in Iraq and Afghanistan have included the LSE General Support Bridge 2 Span Pontoon A General Support Bridge (GSB) 2 span pontoon equipment provides the ability to span larger gaps by using the pontoon as a pier. Two DROPS (support) vehicles equipped with a derrick and hydraulic winch are used to transport the pontoons. The 4 close coupled pontoons are powered by 2 inboard engines, which enables construction and positioning with the minimum of support. Bridging for the 90's System (BR 90) The Bridging for the 90's system (BR 90) is a modular system of bridge components that can be used to form both close support bridging and general support bridging bridges. the modular design allows damaged panels to be replaced. Close Support Bridges These are carried on the TITAN Armoured Vehicle Launching Bridge (AVLB) or the Tank Bridge Transporter (TBT). The Tank Bridge Transporter This has the same cross-country performance as a tank when loaded. It can carry 1 No 10 bridge or 2 No 12 bridges. It can drop off a load of bridges independently, but it cannot recover them. This is no major limitation because bridges are usually left or destroyed in place. No 10 Bridge The No 10 bridge is a scissor type bridge that can be quickly launched and deployed by TITAN however it is not very long and can not cross water itself. No 11 Bridge The No 11 bridge is an 'over and up' bridge. It can be launched very quickly (adopt 15 minutes) and is made up from 2 ramp sections of BR90. No 12 Bridge The No 12 Bridge is 'up and over' bridge. It is the only CSB that does not use the BR90 components. Two can be carried in by 1 TITAN (AVLB), but are launched and recovered separately. Combination Bridging An attachment for the No 10 bridge called a trestle can be used to enable greater spans to be achieved. Using a trestle multiple bridges can be used in combination. This has been proven popular in Afghanistan when rivers are often very wide however since 2005 heavier bridges have been used. Other Bridging Systems Medium Girder Over Bridge The Medium Girder Over Bridge provides an over bridging capability. The bridge set is transported on 1 DROPS pallet and 1 Field Section (Fld Sect) can build it. It is used to reinforce current bridges to allow heavier traffic. It can also be used as a bridge on its own but it does require extensive foundations. Heavy Girder Over Bridge The Heavy Girder Over Bridge (HGOB) provides a lower profile allowing easier crossing for heavy transporters and tankers on line of communication routes. The bridge is transported on 1 DROPS pallet of a 14 tonne truck. A Royal Engineers Section and a crane is used to construct the bridge. The bridge can be constructed by hand but the components are extremely heavy. Like the Medium Girder Over Bridge it is used to reinforce current bridges to allow heavier traffic also like the Medium Girder Over Bridge it can also be used as a bridge on its own but it does require extensive foundations. M3 Amphibious Bridging M3 Amphibious Bridging The M3 Amphibious Rigs are vehicles operated by a 3-man crew. The M3 Rigs can drive into the water, open up and join together to create a bridge of varying length. A 100m bridge can be constructed using 8 rigs. Trackway The Royal Engineers use a variety of aluminium and fabric systems that can be joined to form a trackway, enabling rapid deployment and recovery of temporary roads and reinforced surfaces for existing roads, easing the movement of heavy and tracked vehicles, and reducing damage on the ground. Some can be laid by hand or by machine, however, the heavier aluminium versions are laid with specialist mechanical equipment.Trackway - British Army Website Army.mod.uk. Retrieved 2012-08-07. Class 30 Trackway The Class 30 Trackway can be laid in 15 minutes either from a 4 tonne truck with Launching and Recovery Equipment or from a Medium Wheeled Tractor with a Hydraulic Dispenser. Recovery is by hand onto the 4 tonne LRE or hydraulically using the \\"Beach Dispenser\\". Class 70 Trackway The Class 70 Trackway is made of heavy aluminium planking, with each roll of trackway weighing 2.4 tonnes. Rolls can be launched mechanically using plant equipment or by hand. The planking is attached together by fradrick along the sides. Recovery is by hand or using the Medium Wheeled Tractor (MWT) and beam dispenser. Logistic Trackway (Mammoth Mat) The Logistics Trackway is in rolls 30m long, 4m wide and weigh 1.8 tonnes which can be man handled into position and are only suitable for wheeled vehicles. They also can not be used in sandy conditions.

The fellowship is intended for students under the age of 23 and offers them a total of $100,000 over two years, as well as guidance and other resources, to drop out of school and pursue other work, which could involve scientific research, creating a startup, or working on a social movement. Selection for the fellowship is through a competitive annual process, with about 20‚Äì25 fellows selected annually. It has a selection rate below 0.1%.  History  Peter Thiel announced the fellowship at TechCrunch Disrupt in September 2010. The first round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2010, was announced in May 2011. The second round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2011, was announced in June 2012. The third class (announced in May 2013) includes 22 fellows working on projects from garment manufacturing and B2B web products to ARM powered servers and biomedicine. The class includes 7 fellows from outside of the US. In December 2013, Lora Kolodny wrote an article for the Wall Street Journal reviewing the Thiel Fellowship, where she wrote: \\"64 Thiel Fellows have started 67 for-profit ventures, raised $55.4 million in angel and venture funding, published two books, created 30 apps and 135 full-time jobs, and brought clean water and solar power to 6,000 Kenyans who needed it.\\" The 2014 Thiel Fellows were announced in June 2014. Recipients=Notable recipients Notable recipients include:Thiel Fellowship website: Meet the Fellows * Adam Munich, an experimental physicist currently working to mobilize radiography. * Boyan Slat, founder and CEO of The Ocean Cleanup. * Benjamin Yu, founder of Sprayable and creator of Sprayable Energy and Sprayable Sleep. *Cathy Tie - Founder of Ranomics and Partner at Cervin Ventures *Dale J.

The students featured in the series are Laura Deming, Chris Rueth, Sujay Tyle, and Alex Kiselev. Reception=Initial reception Thiel's announcement of the Thiel Fellowship met with a diverse array of responses. Some, such as Jacob Weisberg, criticized Thiel's proposal for its utopianism and attack on the importance of education. Others, such as Vivek Wadhwa, expressed skepticism about whether the success or failure of the Thiel Fellowship would carry any broader lessons regarding the value of higher education or the wisdom of dropping out. In May 2011, shortly after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, the admissions office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) congratulated two MIT students for receiving the Thiel Fellowship. Both students would need to drop out of MIT to receive the fellowship, but would be able to return to MIT to resume their studies after completing the two-year term of the fellowship if they so desired. Later reception A year after the announcement of the first batch of Thiel Fellows, opinions on the program ranged from the skeptical and critical to the laudatory and optimistic. Eric Markowitz offered a mixed review of the Thiel Fellowship in Inc. magazine. In April 2013, an article by Richard Nieva for PandoDaily took a close look at how the first batch of Thiel Fellows had fared. Thiel Fellowship organizers stated in 2014 that they wanted to include more women among selectees.http://women2.com/2014/07/25/thiel-fellowship-and-gender-diversity- gap/?hvid=44VJU In September 2013, Vivek Wadhwa wrote that the Thiel Fellowship had failed to produce any notable successes to date, and even its limited successes were instances where the Thiel Fellows were working in collaboration with more experienced individuals. On October 10, 2013, former Harvard University President Larry Summers was reported as having said at the Nantucket Project conference: \\"I think the single most misdirected bit of philanthropy in this decade is Peter Thiel's special program to bribe people to drop out of college.\\" His remarks were reported on by many media outlets, ranging from TechCrunch to Valleywag. On October 13, TechCrunch published a response to Summers co-written by a Thiel Fellow and a mentor for the Thiel Fellowship program.

Theory of philanthropy Thiel concentrates the bulk of his philanthropic efforts on what he sees as potential breakthrough technologies. In November 2010, Thiel organized a Breakthrough Philanthropy conference that showcased eight nonprofits that he believed were working on radical new ideas in technology, government, and human affairs. A similar conference was organized in December 2011 with the name \\"Fast Forward\\". Internal projects The Thiel Foundation has three main internal projects: the Thiel Fellowship, Imitatio, and Breakout Labs. Thiel Fellowship The Thiel Fellowship (originally named 20 under 20) is intended for young visionaries under the age of 20 and offers them a total of $100,000 over two years as well as guidance and other resources to drop out of school and pursue other work, which could involve scientific research, creating a startup, or working on a social movement.

The first round of fellows, based on applications made at the end of 2010, was announced in May 2011. Imitatio Imitatio is a project funded by the Thiel Foundation that aims to understand the world through the lens of Rene Girard's mimetic theory. Breakout Labs Breakout Labs is a grant-making body operating as part of the Thiel Foundation (a philanthropic organization created by Peter Thiel). Breakout Labs gives grants for early-stage scientific research that is too speculative or long-term to interest the for-profit sector (such as angel investors and venture capitalists) but may be unsuitable for traditional sources of funding for scientific research due to its radical or offbeat nature. Grants are made through a competitive application and selection process. Breakout Labs announced its first batch of grantees on April 17, 2012, and its second batch of grantees on August 15, 2012. Other organizations supported The Thiel Foundation supports outside groups in three main areas: freedom, science and technology, and anti-violence. Some of the prominent organizations that have received major grants from the Thiel Foundation are described below. Machine Intelligence Research Institute Thiel believes in the importance and desirability of a technological singularity. In February 2006, Thiel provided $100,000 of matching funds to back the Singularity Challenge donation drive of the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (then known as the Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence). Additionally, he joined the Institute's advisory board and participated in the May 2006 Singularity Summit at Stanford as well as at the 2011 Summit held in New York City. In May 2007, Thiel provided half of the $400,000 matching funds for the annual Singularity Challenge donation drive. The organization was a participant in the Breakthrough Philanthropy conference (November 2010) and the Fast Forward conference (December 2011). Anti-aging research: SENS Foundation In September 2006, Thiel announced that he would donate $3.5 million to foster anti-aging research through the Methuselah Mouse Prize foundation. He gave the following reasons for his pledge: \\"Rapid advances in biological science foretell of a treasure trove of discoveries this century, including dramatically improved health and longevity for all. I‚Äôm backing Dr. [Aubrey] de Grey, because I believe that his revolutionary approach to aging research will accelerate this process, allowing many people alive today to enjoy radically longer and healthier lives for themselves and their loved ones.\\" The Thiel Foundation supports the research of the SENS Foundation, headed by Dr. de Grey, that is working to achieve the reversal of biological aging. The Thiel Foundation also supports the work of anti-aging researcher Cynthia Kenyon. Seasteading On April 15, 2008, Thiel pledged $500,000 to the new Seasteading Institute, directed by Patri Friedman, whose mission is \\"to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with diverse social, political, and legal systems.\\" In February 2010 he provided a subsequent grant of $250,000, with an additional $100,000 in matching funds. In 2011, Thiel was reported as having given a total of $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute. Other organizations The Thiel Foundation is also a supporter of the Committee to Protect Journalists, which promotes the right of journalists to report the news freely without fear of reprisal, and the Human Rights Foundation, which organizes the Oslo Freedom Forum. Thiel has also supported the life extension group, the Methuselah Foundation, founded by Aubrey De Grey.Romano, Andrew. (2013-07-24) You Can Live Forever: Is Immortality Plausible?

Her novels, written in the tradition of Jean Paul with artful writing and an ironic undertone, were awarded several prizes, including in 2005 the Georg B√ºchner Prize, in 2011 the Jean-Paul-Preis and in 2017 the Thomas Mann Prize.  Life  Kronauer was born in Essen, and grew up with her mother. She studied pedagogy and worked as a teacher in Aachen and G√∂ttingen. She moved to Hamburg in the mid-1970s, where she began her literary work. Her first novel appeared in 1980, Frau M√ºhlenbeck im Geh√§us, published by , which also published all her following works. The novel has autobiographic elements. Its language was unusual in the literature after World War II, with sentences constructed with acrobatic audacity (\\"von akrobatischer Gewagtheit\\"). Kronauer named Jean Paul as influential for her work. As in his writing, Kronauer's sentences often contain double-meanings and ironic allusions. She wrote successful novels such as Berittener Bogensch√ºtze (1986), Teufelsbr√ºck (2000), Verlangen nach Musik und Gebirge (2004), Err√∂tende M√∂rder (2007), Zwei schwarze J√§ger (2009), Gew√§sch und Gewimmel (2013) and Der Scheik von Aachen (2016). Her novel Das Sch√∂ne, Sch√§bige, Schwankende is scheduled to appear in August 2019. It is focused on a woman writer, full of self-irony. In 2005, she was awarded the Georg B√ºchner Prize for her literary oeuvre. Among other awards, she received the Jean-Paul-Preis in 2011, and the Thomas Mann Prize in 2017. Kronauer died on 22 July 2019 in Hamburg, after a long illness.  Legacy  Kronauer's colleague Martin Mosebach, who delivered the laudatory speech when she received the Thomas Mann Prize, said in an interview by Deutschlandfunk on 24 July 2019 that he regards her as writing in the tradition of Jean Paul in a noble way, mentioning aspects such a sublime artistry (\\"kunstvoll sublim\\") and a tender humour with a floating, ironic, delicate undertone (\\"schwebender, ironischer, zarter Unterton\\"). He described her as a person open to visual impressions, describing a character's emotions by noting how they are reflected in mimics, and great nature scenes, realising how nature \\"arches over the little odd human being\\" (\\"Die Natur w√∂lbt sich √ºber das kleine kauzige Menschenwesen\\"), again similar to Jean Paul. He described her as a person with a penetrating mind, a perfect careful control of expression, always trying hard to find the right word, and of great kindliness (\\"... eben diese einzigartige Gegenwart eines durchdringenden Verstandes, einer vollkommenen, sehr, sehr sorgf√§ltigen Kontrolliertheit ihres Ausdrucks, ein ungeheures Bem√ºhen, immer das genau richtige Wort zu finden ‚Äì und eine gro√üe Liebensw√ºrdigkeit\\"). The FAZ called her one of the greatest post-World War II women writers in German. When she received the Jean-Paul- Preis of Bavaria, her writing was described by the jury: \\"The brilliance of her style makes her an exceptional phenomenon in contemporary German literature\\" (\\"Die Brillanz ihres Stils macht sie zu einer Ausnahmeerscheinung in der deutschen Gegenwartsliteratur\\"), with characteristics such as \\"inventiveness, humanity and a sense of humour that accompanies the often idiosyncratic characters of her books with love, and never betrays them\\" (\\"Erfindungskraft, Humanit√§t und ein Humor, der die oft eigenwilligen Figuren ihrer B√ºcher mit Liebe begleitet und niemals verr√§t\\"), while also considered the 'grand master of spite\\" (\\"Gro√ümeisterin der Boshaftigkeit\\").

It encompasses a major industrial area that developed around two sets of falls on the river in the 19th century. Location The Winooski River flows from the southeast into Burlington Bay, Lake Champlain. The city of Burlington in Chittenden County, Vermont is on the south bank and Winooski and Colchester on the north. It is from the Canada‚ÄìUS border. There are two sets of falls on the river; the settlement of Winooski is placed between the falls. The historic district refers to the mills built on both banks at the lower falls. The designated district stretches on the northern bank of the river to Center and Canal Streets, including 110 West Canal Street, and on the southern bank including Burlington addresses 485 to 497 Colchester Avenue, 5 to 21 Mill Street and 10 to 32 (even numbers only) Barrett Street. with The Burlington addresses represent a 1993 enlargement of the district. with History In 1789, Ira Allen, one of the towns founders built a dam across the upper falls, and used it to power two saw mills to provide cut timber for the British market in Qu√©bec. It was in 1835 that the water rights to the Colchester bank were secured and in 1835 the Burlington Woolen Mill was constructed beneath the lower falls. They followed the employment patterns used in Lowell, Massachusetts, and employed single girls to work in the mills. A series of tenement houses were built to house the operatives, on common land on the hill leading to Winooski Falls Village. The second mill, the Winooski Mill, a cotton mill, was built in 1846 by the Winooski Mill Company on the Burlington side of the river. This operated as such until 1888 when it was reorganised into the Burlington Cotton Mill. Wool remained the less profitable fiber until the cotton famine of the 1860. This and improvements in wool cleaning techniques caused rapid expansion and the construction of new mills. Water power systems improved, and new steam powered system expanded capacity. This require more operatives and a large number of French Canadians and Irish workers were employed. The Colchester Merino Mill and the Winooski Worsted Mill were built in the 1880s. In 1902, the American Woolen Company purchased all the mills from the Burlington Woolen Company and refurbished them with modern equipment. The Champlain Mill was built in 1912. By 1922, the American Woolen Company was the state's largest employer and Winooski Falls split from Colchester, incorporating itself as the City of Winooski. In 1927, there was a major flood where the dams were destroyed and all mills suffered heavy damage, from which some never recovered. The mills closed in 1954. Child LaborLewis Hine Lewis Hine photographed Raoul Julien working as a \\"back- roping boy in a mule spinning room in Chace Mill, in 1909. Leopold Daigneau and Arsene Lussier, 1909 Lewis Hine (September 26, 1874, Oshkosh, Wisconsin ‚Äì November 3, 1940) was an American sociologist and photographer. Hine used his camera as a tool for social reform. His photographs were instrumental in changing the child labor laws in the United States.The Lewis Hine Project retrieved October 15, 2009 In 1908, he became the photographer for the National Child Labor Committee (NCLC), leaving his former teaching position. Over the next decade, Hine documented child labor in American industry to aid the NCLC's lobbying efforts to end the practice.The American Quarterly, Lewis Hine:From \\"Social\\" to \\"Interpretive\\" Photographer by Peter Seixas In 1909 he visited Burlington, and took photographs in Chace Mill. These demonstrate the employment practices where children with French Canadian names are seen to be working in responsible posts, and equally they provide images of the machines in use at the time. Mule spinning was relatively rare in the United States; where ring spinning predominated. Buildings=Burlington Woolen Mill This five story mill was built of local stone over a canal that drove its centrally placed waterwheel. It was built in 1837 and destroyed by fire in 1961. A timber dam was constructed across the lower falls to provide a head for this wheel. The timber dam was destroyed in the floods of 1927. As of 1921 the Burlington Mills employed 1,500 workers who produced items such as Kerseys, Friezes, Meltons, Thibets and worsted dress goods Chace Cotton Mill A three-story, 34-bay brick-built mill built on the site of a previous mill. Water for the waterwheel entered through two head gates connected to the upper dam. One gate opened to the working wheel, while the other lead to the wheel pit of a former wheel, a wallower passes the rotary motion to each floor, which contain line shafts. The Lewis Hine photograph shows that mill had spinning mules with a short travel. The mill was built by the Burlington Mill Company in 1892, and changed its name when it was purchased by the Chace Mills of Fall River in 1912 Champlain Mill A five-story mill, of 28 bays by 8 bays. ( by. Colchester Merino Mill The Colchester Merino Mill built in 1880 and extended in 1902 stands in a group of buildings built on a large rock outcrop. The buildings are dated from 1860 to 1902. The 1902 extension connected it to the Winooski Worsted Mill. Its name tells us that this was a woolen mill built to spin the finest long staple merino wool. It was a 3-story brick built mill with heavy beam construction. The twenty pane windows are topped by segmental brick arches. It was powered by an internal waterwheel which exploited a sliceway from an earlier mill, and used the head provided by the timber dam at the lower falls. Winooski Worsted Mill In the same complex as the Colchester Merino Mill, the Winooski Worsted Mill is a similar design. Worsted is a different thread from woolen using combing rather than carding techniques. The building was similar in design to the Merino Mill; the wood beams though were strengthened by metal tie rods. Carbonizing Mill This is a 1909, brick built structure built for one process in the cleaning of wool. It is a two-story brick building, with basement, oriented parallel to West Canal Street. It comprises a twenty-by-five bay main block, with projecting center bays, attached engine room and dye house with the typical louvred slat roof lights. Raw wool would be weighed and sorted according to a variety of classifications, and sent on for opening, willowing and pickering. Wool fibers would be spread into smooth open layers, cut into slices and cleared of large pieces of vegetative matter. It would be sent for cleaning, or scouring in large vats containing a solution of water, soap and carbonate of potash, and then dried. Scouring did not remove all vegetative particles. In a carbonizing process the wool passed through bowls or troughs containing a solution of sulfuric acid or aluminum chloride where the remaining burrs were burnt off. Timber Dam A lattice work of timber was built across the river, in a manner that was common in New England timber crib dams, what is interesting is the infilling. This was a very early example of the use of concrete. It is here that the Chase Mills Hydro-electric project will be situated. Current usage The Hydropower Reform Coalition has used the water channels to power a 7.4MW Turbo-Generator. Some of the buildings have been converted into loft apartments.

Loosely based on the Mexican telenovela Alcanzar una estrella (To Reach a Star), the series follows aspiring singer-songwriter Loren Tate (Brittany Underwood), whose life changes forever when she crosses paths with her rock star idol Eddie Duran (Cody Longo). Hollywood Heights was executive produced by six-time Emmy Award-winner Jill Farren-Phelps, and co-executive produced by Hisham Abed and Josh Griffith, who also served as head writer. The series was announced in May 2012 as an international co-production between Sony Pictures Television and Televisa, the Mexican production company which owns the rights to the original telenovela. As with the Latin American telenovela format, Hollywood Heights would run every weeknight at 9 p.m. EST through October. Nick at Nite previewed the first episode several times starting on June 11, 2012, before the 80-episode limited series' official premiere on June 18, 2012. The show initially ran on weeknights at 9 p.m. (EST). In May, the network had announced that actor James Franco would appear in a multi-episode story arc as Osborne \\"Oz\\" Silver, an eccentric and ruthless movie mogul. Franco's first appearance was on June 29, 2012. Halfway through the series on August 13, 2012, it was moved to Nick at Nite's sister channel TeenNick at 8 p.m. EST. The series was not renewed for a second season. Plot Loren Tate (Brittany Underwood) is a high school senior dreaming of a career as a singer-songwriter‚Äîand of hunky rock star Eddie Duran (Cody Longo). Eddie, meanwhile, is not happy with the direction his career has taken‚Äîtoward shallow pop music rather than the soulful material he prefers. Following Eddie's manager and label pushing him to give them new songs for a new album, Eddie uses it as an opportunity to launch a new contest in which he can collaborate with a fan on a new song (that is hopefully more to his musical liking). Meanwhile shy Loren, is very hesitant to enter Eddie's contest and fears that any song she writes isn't good enough for her idol. But with Loren's cool single mom, Nora (Jama Williamson), and sassy best friend, Melissa (Ashley Holliday), egging her on, she enters and wins Eddie's songwriting contest, and worlds collide. As Loren is increasingly dazzled by (and welcomed into) Eddie's celebrity world, he is realizing how unhappy he is, trapped in a machine of his own making and at the mercy of his many fans and demanding manager Jake (Brandon Bell). Meanwhile, Loren and Melissa navigate the intrigues of high school life and mean girl Adriana (Hunter King); Melissa's brother Phil (Robert Adamson) gets mixed up with the wrong people; Eddie's father, 1980s musician Max Duran (Carlos Ponce), hopes to end his son's relationship with the duplicitous climber Chloe (Melissa Ordway), who is cheating on Eddie with the ambitious Tyler (Justin Wilczynski), a struggling actor that worked with Eddie but now despises him for his success and who has mysterious ties with Chloe's hidden past. Episodes In the tradition of Latin American telenovelas, Hollywood Heights was conceived as a limited series, in this case 80 episodes, with its storylines resolved by the end of the run. The first 40 of these were broadcast on Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite, with the series moving to TeenNick for the remaining 40.

Background The original telenovela was first broadcast on Canal de las Estrellas in 1990, and later on Univision in the United States. Alcanzar una estrella won a TVyNovelas Award for \\"Best Telenovela of the Year\\" in 1991. The telenovela's success led to the making of a film, M√°s que alcanzar una estrella, and a sequel telenovela, Alcanzar una estrella II, starring Sasha Sokol and Ricky Martin. TeenNick had already embraced the daily soap opera format starting with the tenth season of the Canadian teen drama Degrassi in 2010, airing four episodes weekly. The teen supernatural mystery series House of Anubis (based on a Dutch/Belgian series) followed in 2011, with serialized daily episodes airing on Nickelodeon (and later TeenNick). These successes led to Hollywood Heights, which would run for 16 weeks with, in the tradition of telenovelas, a resolution of storylines. Ed Martin of MediaPost.com called it \\"in every way a major experiment for Nick at Nite, from production to scheduling to publicity and promotion.\\" Broadcast Nick at Nite previewed the first episode of Hollywood Heights several times starting on June 11, 2012, before the 80-episode limited series officially premiered on June 18, 2012. The show initially ran every weeknight at 9 p.m. (EST), but halfway through the series on August 13, 2012, it was moved to Nick at Nite's sister channel TeenNick at 8 p.m. EST. Reception Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times noted that the series was produced by executive and creative personnel \\"whose combined credits include what seems to be every major network soap opera of the last 50 years as well as 21st-century reality soaps such as The Hills and The City.\\" He wrote, \\"If Heights is not particularly novel‚Äîit is, after all, based on a series two decades old‚Äîneither does it reek of must and mildew. Nor do the musical performances seem contrived, or rather they seem authentically contrived, staged as they would be staged by a performer like Eddie, who deals in thumping aspirational party anthems.\\" Lloyd added, \\"what I've seen, if not exactly appointment television for a person of my age and interests, is pretty appealing; by the standards of most other TV shows about teens and pop stars, it is well observed, well informed and (so far) plausible.\\" Joe Caramanica of The New York Times wrote, \\"Even though the melodrama, highly structured scripting and stilted camera shots are indebted to the telenovela form, Hollywood Heights owes the most to the rat-tat-tat rhythms of Gilmore Girls.\\" Of James Franco's performance Caramanica wrote, \\"Mr. Franco chews more than his share of scenery, which turns out to be a necessary strategy. In an environment like this, in which all the performances have soft edges, and no one is steering the scenes too aggressively, acting out is the only sort of acting that gets noticed. His frazzled energy isn‚Äôt realistic but is instead fantastical and a running commentary on the stiltedness of the rest of the proceedings.\\" Ed Martin of MediaPost.com noted that creatively the series \\"so far has been a bit on the safe and sterile side, even more than Degrassi and certainly more than the often quite edgy fare on ABC Family.\\" Variety's Brian Lowry wrote that though Hollywood Heights was \\"tailored to [Nickelodeon's] demo with a musical component and teen-tempting leads ... For a show with a pop undercurrent that proclaims itself 'sizzling', Heights is pretty tepid and lacks a hit song‚Äôs most basic element: A catchy hook.\\" Suggesting that daily episodes were difficult to reasonably keep up with, Caramanica still called it \\"comfort TV with narrative soul.\\" Martin agreed that daily episodes \\"may be too much of a demand to place on potential viewers in the new media world of ever-increasing competition and ever-shrinking attention spans.\\" ReferencesExternal links   2010s American drama television series American telenovelas 2012 American television series debuts 2012 American television series endings American television soap operas English-language television shows Nick at Nite original programming Television series by Sony Pictures Television Television shows set in Los Angeles American television series based on telenovelas American television series based on Mexican television series ","title":"Hollywood Heights (TV series)"},{"id":"36019265","text":"GreatNonprofits is a 501(c)-3 registered non-profit organization based in the United States that describes itself as \\"the leading developer of tools that allow people to find, review, and share information about great ‚Äì and perhaps not yet great ‚Äì nonprofits\\".About page on the GreatNonprofits website The site allows donors, volunteers, and clients to share their personal experiences with and reviews of charitable organizations, essentially providing crowdsourced information about the reputability of these organizations.

Irina is considered one of the most devastating systems of the 2011‚Äì12 season. Irina formed from a tropical wave that was located north of Madagascar. The disturbance continued to move south and became Irina on February 27\\\\. Irina moved parallel to the Madagascar coast causing extreme flooding which claimed nearly 77 lives. The system still has an unknown damage total. Meteorological history On 22 February, an area of disturbed weather formed in the South-West Indian Ocean. The system steadily strengthened into a low pressure area shortly afterwards. With favorable conditions, ample convection was able to wrap around the low level circulation center, which allowed the system to strengthen into a tropical depression, on 25 February. On 26 February, RSMC La Reunion upgraded the system to Moderate Tropical Storm Irina as it continued to intensify. However, Irina made landfall on Northern Madagascar a few hours later and weakened into an overland depression. On 27 February, Irina emerged off the northwestern coast of Madagascar. Within the next several hours, Irina was able to strengthen slightly, as the storm moved very close along the coast of Madagascar. Later on the same day, Irina made landfall a second time on Madagascar, this time at Northwest Madagascar. Late on 27 February, Irina weakened into a Zone of Disturbed Weather, while it was overland. Early on 28 February, Irina emerged off the western coast of Madagascar.https://www.webcitation.org/65oIMU3fo?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/AWIO20-FMEE_201202281300.pdf Later on the same day, Irina regained tropical depression intensity, and slowly began to reorganize. However, for the next day, Irina was unable to regain Moderate Tropical Storm intensity, because of poor organization, and because the storm's low level circulation center was displaced, well to the east of the storm's convection. Early on 29 February, Irina was able to reorganize sufficiently, and regained Moderate Tropical Storm status. Just a few hours later, the JTWC designated Irina as Tropical Cyclone 12S.https://www.webcitation.org/65oIvAzND As Irina continued to organize, the storm gradually began to strengthen, as it turned southward, along the western coast of Madagascar. On 1 March, Irina intensified into a Severe Tropical Storm, as it moved towards Western Madagascar. Late on that same day, Irina reached its peak intensity, with a minimum low pressure of 979 mbars. Early on 5 March, Irina weakened into a Moderate Tropical Storm.https://www.webcitation.org/65wErzodE?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WTIO30-FMEE_201203050646.htmmaestro The system then made a small loop off the coasts of Mozambique and South Africa before starting to head in a northwestern direction towards Madagascar yet again due to weak steering conditions. The official death toll as of 6 March stood at 77, including at least 65 dead in the island nation, most of them in the southeastern Ifanadiana district. Five fishermen were killed of the Mozambique coast and at least 3 more people in the south of the country when a tree fell on their roof and collapsed it. South Africa reported four fatalities as waves of up to 3 m battered the port of Durban and forced all ships to seek safety. Irina is the deadliest storm of the season so far, and took the total death toll of the 2011‚Äì12 season to 164, the highest since the 2006‚Äì07 season. Later on 6 March, wind shear began taking its toll on the system, and much of the storm's convection in the outer rain band were eroded away. As the storm continued to move towards Southern Madagascar, the wind shear removed more of the storm's convection, even as the storm continued to weaken. On 7 March, Irina began to stall. Early on 8 March, only a small amount of convection remained, which was wrapped around the center of circulation. Early on 9 March, Irina's eye disappeared, as the storm continued to weaken. As the storm turned back towards South Africa, it lost its organization, due to the strong wind shear. Early on 10 March, RSMC Reunion issued their last advisory on Irina, as the storm degenerated into a remnant low.https://www.webcitation.org/666YTnr4K?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WTIO24-FMEE_201203101205.htm Over the next 2 days, Irina's remnant low continued to drift northwestwards. On 12 March, Irina's remnants made landfall over the Gaza Province, and dissipated. Preparation and impact Once Irina began to move along the coast of Madagascar, it brought severe floods and many landslides which claimed nearly 72 lives, with almost 911 misplaced near Antananarivo. Several authorities along the western coast said that the storm destroyed nearly 1,348 homes and caused landslides which blocked several roads which isolated several villages.http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/03/tropical-storm-irina-killed-72-in- madagascar/ See also *Cyclone Ivan *2011‚Äì12 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season References 2011‚Äì12 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season Irina South-West Indian Ocean severe tropical storms Irina de:Zyklonsaison im S√ºdwestindik 2011‚Äì2012 ","title":"Tropical Storm Irina"},{"id":"36019460","text":"Berenika Tomsia (born March 18, 1988) is a female Polish volleyball player.

Loew and Charles Einfeld in 1946, right after Garfield's contract with Warner Bros. had expired. Having recently turned freelance, the idea was Garfield's outlet in obtaining creative control over his own projects, as well as encouraging fellow filmmakers to pursue their own humanistic advocacies through their work. Garfield made two films with Enterprise: Body and Soul (1947) and Force of Evil (1948). Other productions include Arch of Triumph (1948), starring Ingrid Bergman and Charles Boyer; and Caught (1949), directed by Max Oph√ºls and starring James Mason and Barbara Bel Geddes. During its existence, Enterprise had its films distributed by United Artists from 1947 to mid-1948. The last three films were distributed by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. Eventually, after the box-office failure that Force of Evil brought (as well as Garfield's trouble with the House Un-American Activities Committee), Enterprise folded in 1949. The film Caught was its last production. The careers of Robert Rossen, the director of Body and Soul, and Abraham Polonsky, director of Force of Evil, were seriously affected by HUAC.

It was founded in 1816 by George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester, in what was during those years the northern extremity of his diocese. For many subsequent years the vicar of St Bees was effectively both the principal of the college and also its proprietor. The college drew students both from England and from Wales. It catered particularly for those prospective ordinands for whom the cost of a traditional university degree course would have been prohibitive. They attended lectures and had their library within the rebuilt chancel of St Bees Priory, whilst living in lodgings throughout the parish.Nicholas Groves, Theological Colleges: their hoods and histories, published by the Burgon Society, 2004, pages 18-19, Over 2,600 clergy are believed to have trained at the college during the course of its history. Lacking an adequate corporate administrative and financial basis, and also suffering from a loss of much individual interest from subsequent bishops of Chester and bishops of Carlisle, the theological college finally closed in 1895.Trevor Park, St Bees College, 1816‚Äì1895, a short history (1982) Establishment The Interior of the monastic chancel, which was the first lecture room Bishop George Henry Law of Chester had a severe problem with the shortage of new good clergy in his large and growing diocese. He had local connections with West Cumbria, and on a visit in 1816 saw an opportunity to found a college for training of ordinands at St Bees. The Lowthers had become very rich through their extensive coal mines in Whitehaven, but were now in a difficult position. They had manipulated the governors of St Bees School to lease the lucrative mineral rights of Whitehaven from St Bees School for a derisory amount by means of a forged document. This was now coming to light, mainly through the efforts of the Rev W Wilson, headmaster of St Bees School, who whistle-blew, but was sacked for his pains in 1816. But the story was out, and the Lowthers were anxious for an opportunity to restore their reputation. They were receptive to Bishop Law's suggestion that they fund the building of a college at St Bees.St Bees Theological College - St Bees Village web site, retrieved Jan 2016 The Lowthers offered to restore the ruined chancel of the monastic church to house the college, and donated land for a vicarage. They offered to Bishop Law the patronage of the living, which they held, so that the principal of the new college would also be the vicar of St Bees. Law grasped this opportunity, and so was born St Bees Theological College. This was to be a pioneering institution; the first Church of England College for the training of clergy outside the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. By 1817 the repair work was complete. The roofless monastic chancel had been restored, and became the main lecture room for the college. News of the college soon spread, and it first opened to admit 20 students, who paid ¬£5 a term. Although the principal would also perform all the duties of the vicar, the college was effectively a private business. The college had no accommodation, and students lodged in the village. Students had a very good chance of employment in the Diocese of Chester, and the cost of living and fees were much lower than at the two universities. Growth The first principal, William Ainger, was only 31 when appointed, and had no previous experience of running a theological institution. However, the college prospered immediately, with numbers rising to 36 admissions in 1822. Ainger had to work alone until 1826, when the increasing scope of the training course obliged him to take on an assistant, the Rev. Richard Parkinson, and to double the fees to ¬£10 a term. Although Ainger also carried out all the duties of a parish priest, he had the time and energy to make the reputation of the college grow. Shortly before Ainger's death in 1840 at the age of 55, St Bees College was mentioned specifically in national legislation along with Oxford and Cambridge, Durham and St David's. Ainger's successor was the Rev. Richard Buddicom, aged 60, who had quite a different theological standpoint and came from the evangelical wing of the church. He was an early supporter of the Church Missionary Society, and was elected to the newly built chapel of St George's, Everton, in 1813, where he remained until coming to St Bees. He had published a large body of sermons and had a huge reputation as a preacher. When he preached for the first time in Whitehaven, over 3,000 people came to hear him. Although principal, he took very seriously his responsibility for Whitehaven with 20,000 people, which was still part of the ecclesiastical parish of St Bees. Whitehaven had three chapels of ease; Trinity, St James and St Nicholas, each with a curate. Buddicom died in 1846. His successor was Richard Parkinson, who had been a lecturer at the college until 1833, when he was appointed a Fellow of Manchester Collegiate church (now the cathedral). Under Parkinson College admissions rose, and he set about schemes for improving the college and buildings. He proposed to incorporate the college with a charter, so it could confer degrees, and to build residential accommodation. Parkinson offered to donate ¬£5,000 personally. However, he would not surrender power to a proposed governing council of clergy and laity, and consequently the scheme failed. Had the college progressed in this way, it may well have survived into the 20th century. Instead, Parkinson applied his energies to extending the vicarage and improving the church. Canon Parkinson died in 1858, and his successor, and was succeeded by Rev. G. H. Ainger, the son of the first principal, William Ainger. He was to be known as the great builder of the college and restorer of the priory. The college continued to prosper, and during the 1860s annual admissions were frequently over 40. College life seems to have been particularly lively at this time, with many grand celebrations. There was a gala day at the Priory when Ainger was presented with a handsome portrait costing ¬£100. The Militia band played, and a special train was put on from Whitehaven. On another occasion, the anniversary dinner of the college in 1862, no fewer than 25 toasts were proposed, which attracted the criticism of the Whitehaven Temperance Society. The popularity of the college meant there had to be additional teaching facilities, and in 1863 a new building was completed to the design of William Butterfield, to provide two large lecture rooms. This still stands to the south of the priory and is known as the New College Halls. Ainger was principal until 1871, when he moved to be vicar of Rothbury. Decline The new principal was Canon E H Knowles, who had been a mathematics and classics master at St Bees School from 1843 to 1864, then headmaster of Kenilworth Grammar School. He had close ties with the college, having married Revd. G. H. Ainger's sister. College numbers initially dropped during the 1870s but picked up again in the 1880s, with a maximum yearly intake of 47 in 1883. However, although St Bees College had been a pioneering institution, the rest of the country had caught up. There were now numerous theological colleges modelled on the St Bees example, but mainly in large cities and affiliated in some way to a university. Standards were rising, and in 1893 the bishops of the Church of England agreed that a common entrance exam must be taken before non-graduates could enter a theological college. This dramatically affected the numbers at St Bees as it channelled theological candidates down the graduate route, which St Bees was unable to support. In addition it was still a private institution, and was run at financial risk by the principal. Consequently, Knowles, who was now 75, decided to give notice to close the college in December 1895. Legacy St Bees Theological College had an productive and influential life in the history of the Church of England. It trained over 2,600 clergy for the ministry, and had been the model for the new breed of theological colleges. However, the seeds of failure were sown because of its geographical position and the refusal of Parkinson to allow it to come fully under Church management. Present-day use of the buildings The closure of the college resulted in three substantial halls becoming available for parochial use. The original lecture room, in the re- roofed monastic chancel, known as the Old College Hall, has had various uses, including as a music room by St Bees School, with which the college has sometimes been confused. It was restored in 2012 and is in regular parish use, and the rehearsal room for the priory choir. The additional lecture rooms designed by Butterfield became known as the \\"New College Halls\\", and the lower hall was for a while a public library. They are now in parochial use for meetings and village organisations. A few of the college archives survived within the St Bees parish records, now deposited with the Cumbria Archive Service at nearby Whitehaven.

Biography Reale was born in Candia Lomellina, Pavia.

He later continued his studies in Marburg an der Lahn and Munich. After a period of teaching in high schools, he won a professorship at the University of Parma, where he taught courses in moral philosophy and the history of philosophy. He then returned to the Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore of Milan, where he was professor of the history of ancient philosophy for many years, and where he also founded the Centro di Ricerche di Metafisica. In 2005 he moved to teach at the new faculty of philosophy at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University of Milan. He died on 15 October 2014 in his home in Luino.La Stampa Research His main argument is that categories of Greek philosophy and its particular way of thinking led to the birth and development of the science and technology in the West. His research interests range throughout the ancient pagan and Christian thought, and his most significant contributions have touched gradually Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Socrates and Augustine of Hippo. He studied each of these authors from an against-the-grain perspective, inaugurating, in the opinion of Cornelia de Vogel, a new reading of these authors. Reale's reinterpretation of Aristotle disputes the positivist-influenced interpretation of Werner Jaeger, according to which the writings of Aristotle are informed by a progression of dominant beliefs: at first, theology, where debate is in reference to God; then metaphysics, where the universal rights of man are the focus; and finally arriving at the viewpoint of science. Reale argued instead the fundamental unity of the metaphysical thought of Aristotle.

The second tropical storm and first hurricane of the extremely active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, the system formed on June 24 to the east of the Lesser Antilles. It moved westward and attained hurricane status before striking Trinidad on June 27. The storm caused heavy damage on the island, estimated at around $3 million. The strong winds downed trees and destroyed hundreds of houses, leaving about 1,000 people homeless. Later, the hurricane crossed the northeastern portion of Venezuela, where power outages and damaged houses were reported.

The 1933 Monthly Weather Review summary of the season noted that the hurricane was the \\"earliest known in [the] general area also the only one in a record of nearly 50 years to pass south of the Island of Trinidad and over the northeast corner of Venezuela.\\" About two hours after striking Venezuela, the hurricane entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea. For the next few days it maintained its intensity while tracking to the northwest. A ship on June 30 reported a pressure of , suggesting winds of about 100 mph (160 km/h). The next day, the hurricane passed south of Jamaica and turned more to the west before resuming a northwest motion. At around 0600 UTC on July 3, the hurricane made landfall on western Cuba with winds of 100 mph (160 km/h). It weakened while crossing the island, although it maintained hurricane status upon entering the Gulf of Mexico. On July 4, a strong high pressure area over the eastern United States turned the hurricane to the west. After restrengthening, the storm attained peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) on July 5, based on a ship report of a pressure of . It maintained that intensity for about 18 hours, and during that time the hurricane turned to the southwest. At 0100 UTC on July 8, the hurricane made its final landfall near La Pesca, about halfway between Tampico, Tamaulipas and Brownsville, Texas. The intensity at landfall was estimated at around . After moving ashore, the hurricane rapidly weakened over the high terrain of northeastern Mexico, and the storm dissipated at around 1200 UTC on July 8. Impact Throughout its path, the hurricane killed at least 35 people altogether in Trinidad, Venezuela, Jamaica, and Cuba. The hurricane first affected Trinidad, causing about $3 million in damage in the southern portion of the island. The storm destroyed 300 houses in one village, and thousands were left homeless. Trees across the island fell down and blocked many roads, including one that struck a car and seriously injured one man. Heavy damage was also reported to the cocoa industry. High winds destroyed about 60 oil derricks, and an oil supply line was disrupted due to fallen trees. This represented a significant loss to the island's oil industry, one of two such events in the 1930s. High winds downed power lines across the island, which were repaired by three days after the storm struck. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall and destroyed the roofs of many houses. Little damage occurred in the capital city of Port of Spain. There were 13 deaths in Trinidad, some of whom drowned after their boats sank. After the storm, medical assistance and relief supplies were sent via boat to Cedros, which was one of the most significantly affected areas. After affecting Trinidad, the hurricane struck northeastern Venezuela, where damage was heaviest in Car√∫pano, R√≠o Caribe, and Isla Margarita. High winds cut telephone and telegraph lines for several days. The storm destroyed several houses and fishing boats, resulting in several million bol√≠vares in damage. Officials reported that there were \\"a number of lives lost\\" due to the hurricane. Striking with winds of , the storm was one of only three Atlantic tropical cyclones on record at the time to affect the country with hurricane-force winds as of 2015, after hurricanes in 1877 and 1892. After moving across the Caribbean, the hurricane affected Jamaica. High winds downed about 200,000 banana trees, while flooding in the western portion of the island affected roads and railways. Later, the hurricane crossed western Cuba, killing 22 people and causing $4 million in damage. The hurricane destroyed about 100 houses in Pinar del R√≠o Province from the combination of strong winds and flooding from heavy rainfall. One person died after her house collapsed in the province. The rainfall caused four rivers to exceed their banks, and the storm-related flooding left serious damage to the tobacco industry. The storm also damaged crops in the region. High winds downed telephone and telegraph lines in western Cuba. Little damage was reported in the capital city of Havana, despite the report of a peak wind gust of . After the storm, Cuban President Gerardo Machado utilized the military to assist in relief operations and prevent looting. The threat of the storm prompted the United States Weather Bureau to issue southeast storm warnings for Key West, Florida. Light rainfall from the storm was reported in Miami. Before the storm made its final landfall, the Weather Bureau issued northeast storm warnings from Brownsville to Port O'Connor, Texas on July 5. That same day, a hurricane warning was also issued for Brownsville. The hurricane ultimately struck a sparsely-populated area of northeastern Mexico, causing several deaths and heavy damage in the country. High winds downed trees and power lines, and damaged the roofs of several houses. Along the beach near Tampico, high tides damaged coastal structures and flooded some cars. The effects extended into Texas, and Brazos Island, Port Isabel, and Port Aransas were flooded due to the storm surge. High tides damaged ten piers in Port Isabel, and there was damage to buildings along the coast. The storm damaged the cotton and fruit crops in south Texas from high winds and rainfall. Rains from the storm ended an extended drought in the Brownsville area.

Biography  Goicoechea worked for the remote coal narrow gauge railway of La Robla (Le√≥n), the longest narrow gauge line in Western Europe which today is operated by FEVE, developing a welded steel carriage and various elements of suspension, brakes and traction. In 1936 he suggested a lightweight articulated meter gauge trainset which however was not approved by the management.Manuel Gal√°n Eruste, Miguel Cano L√≥pez-Luzzatti: 1942-Talgo-2010 - From a dream to high speed, Patentes Talgo 2011, Goicoechea authored the Iron Belt to protect Bilbao during the Spanish Civil War. But soon before finishing it he defected to the Nationalist side, and this was decisive in the Nationalists conquering Bilbao on June 12, 1937. In 1938, he described a train composed of articulated triangular structures with independent wheels, capable of commercial speeds. In 1941, a test unit composed of triangular chassis and truck wheels with carriage rims welded on was built and tested successfully up to behind a steam locomotive. In 1942 Goicoechea worked with the company Hijos de Juan de Garay in O√±ate and other companies to build a first test train consisting of seven low-slung cars of only length, of a roughly semi-circular cross-section, pulled by a power unit based on a powered bogie from Ganz Works. In the same year he teamed up with Jos√© Luis de Oriol y Urig√ºen, founding the Patentes Talgo company and baptizing the test train Talgo I (Tren Articulado Ligero Goicoechea Oriol). The Talgo I was tested until 1945, then damaged during a test run and scrapped in the early 1950s. In 1944 Goicoechea started working with the American Car and Foundry Company to design the Talgo II but left the company in 1945 before the train was completed. Later he suggested a connection between Spain and Morocco by rail tunnel in Gibraltar, which did not become reality.Euskomedia: Alejandro Goicoechea Omar He died in 1984, aged 89.\\"Alejandro Goicoechea, creador del tren articulado Talgo, falleci√≥ ayer en Madrid a los 89 a√±os de edad\\"  References  External links  * Bolet√≠n Oficial de la Propiedad Industrial, 1 de abril de 1936, n¬∫ 1190, p√°gina 1246, Concesi√≥n de patente de invenci√≥n 141.056 Alejandro de Goicoechea y Omar por \\"Un nuevo sistema ferroviario de transporte por rodadura elevada\\" presentada el 1 de febrero de 1936 y concedida el 16 de marzo de 1936. 1895 births 1984 deaths People from Durangaldea Spanish engineers Spanish inventors Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War 20th-century inventors 20th-century engineers ","title":"Alejandro Goicoechea"},{"id":"36019852","text":"Tea is a feminine given name which is cognate to the names Theia, Thea and T√©a.

Initially a parochial school founded and run by white Presbyterians, it was restructured in 1924 and became an accredited junior college with an all-black faculty and black administrator in 1933. The school was closed in 1943, reopened the following year, and operated until 1972.  History = Seminary  Mary Allen Seminary historic marker The school was founded in Crockett, Texas in 1886 by the Presbyterian pastor Revered Richard Allen, and his wife Mary E. Allen. At the time, it was the first and only school that was open to the nearly 200,000 freed black women in the state. Planning for the institution was started in 1885 by the Board of Missions for Freedmen of the Presbyterian Church and was largely influenced by Mary, whose husband was the secretary of the board. The city of Crockett was chosen as the location for the school because the area had a large black population, and because a parochial school for black students was already located there. In January 1886, the first three teachers arrived in Crockett and settled in a rented farm to begin instruction. Mary died in April 1887, and the school was named in her honor. At first the school provided a liberal arts education, but later, due to criticism that it and other institutions like it around the country were not providing black women with necessary vocational training, the curriculum shifted to subjects such as cooking, dressmaking, and millinery. By the end of its first year, the school had 46 students, and in that year a brick building was erected to house students and faculty. As enrollment grew over the subsequent years, citizens from Crockett and elsewhere in the United States began donating land and money to the school, and by 1891 the campus consisted of 260 acres of land and an additional brick hall, named after the benefactor, Michigan United States Senator James McMillan. Though the students were all black, the faculty of the seminary was initially composed of white women. In 1921, a Presbyterian newspaper advertised the position of \\"white lady teachers\\" at the school, promising 44 dollars per month for an eight-month term, plus \\"maintenance and railroad fare both ways.\\"  Junior college  In 1924, the Texas school board appointed the first black administrator, the Reverend Burt Randall Smith, to restructure Mary Allen Seminary. Over the next eight years, Smith oversaw an overhaul of the curriculum, including expansion of the library and science facilities, and in 1932 the school became an accredited junior college with an all-black faculty. In 1933, the school changed its name to Mary Allen Junior College and became a coeducational institution. The school was closed in 1943 after a failed proposal to transform it into a black state college. In 1944, it was reopened by the National Missionary Baptist Convention of America and operated until 1972.

The line of mostly black-and-white, anthology magazines predominantly featured horror, sword and sorcery, and science fiction. The magazines did not carry the Marvel name, but were produced by Marvel staffers and freelancers, and featured characters regularly found in Marvel comic books, as well as some creator-owned material. In addition to the many horror titles, magazines in this group included Savage Sword of Conan, The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, Marvel Preview, and Planet of the Apes. The magazine format did not fall under the purview of the comics industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, allowing the titles to feature stronger content than mainstream color comic books, such as moderate profanity, partial nudity, and more graphic violence. In addition to original content, many issues included reprinted material, including a number of horror stories from Marvel's 1950s predecessor Atlas Comics that originally were published before the 1954 introduction of the Comics Code.  History  The magazine line was Marvel's second attempt, following the two-issue superhero entry The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1968, at entering the comics-magazine field dominated by Warren Publishing and smaller publishers like Eerie Publications and Skywald Publications. The magazine format did not fall under the purview of the comics industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, allowing the titles to feature stronger content than mainstream color comic books, such as moderate profanity, partial nudity, and more graphic violence. The first title was Savage Tales, which debuted in 1971 and was immediately cancelled. Roy Thomas, a Marvel writer-editor who become the company's editor-in-chief in 1972, recalled that: After having sold Magazine Management in 1968, Goodman left in 1972, the same year the company's new owners revived the magazine line. In addition to Savage Tales, now with a new lineup of content, Magazine Management released the new titles Dracula Lives!, Vampire Tales, and Monsters Unleashed, as well as Monster Madness, a humorous fumetti magazine (all published under the Marvel Monster Group brand); Tales of the Zombie; the prose digest Haunt of Horror; and the satirical-comics magazine Crazy. Editor Wolfman said, \\"We used to farm the books out to Harry Chester Studios [sic] and whatever they pasted up, they pasted up. I formed the first production staff, hired the first layout people, paste-up people.\\" 1974 saw the debut of The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, Monsters of the Movies, Planet of the Apes, Savage Sword of Conan, and Marvel's short- lived entree into underground comix, Comix Book. By late 1974, Magazine Management was publishing 11 black-and-white comics magazine market with 11 regular titles. Al Hewetson, editor of rival comics-magazine publisher Skywald Publications, blamed his company's demise on Despite this victory, in 1975 the Marvel magazine line was revamped. All the horror titles were cancelled (although several would then get an all-reprint, extra-thick \\"Annual\\" #1). The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu, Planet of the Apes, Savage Sword of Conan, and Crazy continued, and quite a few new titles were announced, promoted, and listed in the regular subscription ads, but almost none were released as ongoing publications. Marvel Super Action and Marvel Movie Premiere became one-shots, while Sherlock Holmes and Star-Lord surfaced in the Marvel Preview anthology. Some of the material intended for a self-titled magazine for the martial-arts superhero Iron Fist, whose four-color feature was at this time still appearing under the Marvel Premiere title, saw the light of publishing day in The Deadly Hands of Kung Fu #10. Masters of Terror and Doc Savage did manage two and eight issues respectively. The line would never again consist at one time of more titles than could be counted on the fingers of one hand. 1977 saw the debut of Rampaging Hulk (which later changed its title to The Hulk!, which ran through 1981). Starting with 1981 cover-dates, the line bore the name Marvel Magazine Group on such new titles as the Howard the Duck magazine as well as on such surviving titles as Savage Sword of Conan - the longest-lived magazine title, which lasted 235 issues through 1995. Upon the line's demise, former editor Wolfman asserted that \\"Marvel never gave their full commitment to it, that was the problem. No one wanted to commit themselves to the staff.\\" The magazines featured fully painted covers by illustrators including Earl Norem, Bob Larkin, Ken Barr, Luis Dominguez, Neal Adams, Frank Brunner, Boris Vallejo, and Joe Jusko. Initially, the magazines' page-counts varied among 68, 76, and 84 pages. Writer Doug Moench contributed heavily to the magazines, including to the entire runs of Planet of the Apes, Rampaging Hulk, and Doc Savage, while also writing for virtually every other title in the line. Marvel production manager Sol Brodsky, who in 1970 had helped launch the short-lived Skywald Publications line of black-and-white horror magazines before returning to Marvel, served as production manager here as well. (Scroll down to interview.) Lead editors for the magazine group were Roy Thomas, Marv Wolfman, and later Archie Goodwin and John Warner. Tony Isabella, Don McGregor, and David Anthony Kraft also spent stints editing magazine titles. In addition to original content, many issues included reprinted material, including a number of horror stories from Marvel's 1950s predecessor Atlas Comics that originally were published before the 1954 introduction of the Comics Code.  Curtis brand  Initially, the only company brand on the magazines was the \\"three C's\\" Curtis Circulation Company logo (Curtis being Marvel's distributor and an affiliated company). The Marvel Comics brand and logo did not always appear on the cover or in the indicia; the only obvious relation to Marvel being the publisher's name, Magazine Management, a name that the four-color comics stopped using in 1973 but was retained for the black-and-white magazines.The \\"three C's\\" logo was also used for some of Magazine Management publisher Martin Goodman's men's humor cartoon magazines such as Best Cartoons, Cartoons & Gags, Cartoon Laughs, Popular Cartoons, and Popular Jokes during the 1970s. Most of these magazines contained single-panel cartoons, but many of them also contained short \\"Pussycat\\" stories by Jim Mooney and others. Other so-called Curtis magazines included the Sensuous Streaker one-shot and Nostalgia Illustrated, which lasted for nearly a year. None of these magazines were advertised in Marvel comic books. Nonetheless, Marvel characters appeared regularly in the magazine line, and many of the magazine titles were featured in the four-color comics' house advertisements. The Curtis imprint was reduced to \\"CC\\" in 1975.

The magazine was an attempt to cash in on the success of Warren's Famous Monsters of Filmland (Another similar title with a similar goal was Monsters Unleashed.) The Monsters of the Movies staff was roughly composed of half freelancing West Coast horror fans, and half members of the Marvel bullpen located on the East Coast. The West Coast editor was short story author and popular culture historian Jim Harmon.\\"Marvel Bullpen Bulletins,\\" Marvel comics cover-dated December 1974. Over time, tensions developed between the West Coast and East Coast staff cliques, a factor that may have contributed to the series ending after just nine issues. A postmortem by assistant editor Ralph Macchio, appeared the following year in the pages of Marvel Preview #8: The Legion of Monsters (1976) (one of Marvel's final stabs at launching a magazine starring horror characters), and seemed to blame the West Coasters for the failure, and left ill feelings among them in its wake, especially as Macchio was not even on Marvel's staff during the events he described.Kracalik, Al. \\"Monsters of the Movies: The True Story ‚Äì How to Make a Monster Magazine...

He and his wife Salome endowed the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art in Canonbury, north London. Early life and education Eric Estorick was born Elihu Estorick in 1913 in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Jewish √©migr√©s from Russia. He studied at New York University where he obtained a PhD in Sociology, and at the New School for Social Research in New York. He later taught at New York University and at Columbia University. Personal life In 1947 he married Salome Dessau (1920‚Äì1989), the daughter of a German Jewish refugee who became a textile manufacturer in England. Salome had studied art in London, and was involved in some of Eric's art collecting. Salome worked as a textile designer and invented stretch lace. She was employed by the clothing retailer Marks & Spencer, which was a customer of her father's business. Eric Estorick also subsequently worked for Marks & Spencer, and wrote a history of the company. Career During the Second World War he joined the United States Government Service, and became head of the British Empire Division of the US Foreign Broadcast Intelligence Service. In the 1940s he wrote several books on politics, including two biographies of Sir Stafford Cripps. In 1964 he used his contacts in Czechoslovakia to arrange for the recovery of 1,564 Jewish Torah scrolls that had been confiscated by the Nazi authorities when the Czechoslovak Jews were exterminated. Estorick had the scrolls transferred to Westminster Synagogue in London, and they eventually were distributed to Jewish congregations worldwide. Shortly before his death in 1993, Eric Estorick set up and endowed the Eric and Salome Estorick Foundation, which founded the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art in London. In addition to providing the works that form the core of the collection, Estorick gave paintings by Chagall and Kandinsky to be sold to fund it. London was chosen as the home for the collection in spite of offers to acquire it from the Italian government and from museums in the United States and Israel. Art collecting and dealing While a student in New York, Estorick met the American photographer and gallery owner Alfred Stieglitz. Estorick later said: During their honeymoon in Switzerland in 1947, Eric and Salome Estorick met Arturo Bryks, a former teacher at the Bauhaus, who introduced them to Umberto Boccioni's book on Italian Futurism. Before returning from their honeymoon they visited Mario Sironi in Milan from whom they bought a large quantity of his work. Estorick wrote: In the aftermath of World War Two, twentieth-century European art could be bought very cheaply and Estorick bought works by many artists including Picasso, Braque, Gris and L√©ger. The price of modern Italian paintings was particularly low because of the taint of Fascism; Estorick bought heavily and became friends with several artists. Estorick started art dealing in the early 1950s, initially by buying work by well-known European artists and selling it in Hollywood. Anne Douglas (Kirk Douglas's wife) became his business partner and his customers included Tony Curtis and Burt Lancaster. In 1960 Estorick opened the Grosvenor Gallery in London, which became the centre of his business as an art dealer. Estorick lent work for temporary exhibitions at several public galleries, including all the works for an exhibition of Italian art the Tate Gallery in 1956. In 1963, Estorick lent several paintings for the filming of Carl Foreman's The Victors. The Vlaminck and Braque paintings seen in the film are the real thing. Eric Estorick is credited in the film as art consultant. Before the fall of Communism Estorick made several visits to the Soviet Union to buy artwork, negotiating export permits from the Soviet Ministry of Culture. In 1967, Estorick met Ert√© in Paris. Estorick became his exclusive world agent, creating business worth $100 million annually. Publications  (The two Stafford Cripps books published in 1949 in London and New York may be different editions of the same work) Estorick also wrote A History of Marks and Spencer (c. 1953), which was printed privately, and an unpublished novel in collaboration with Dora Russell (the wife of Bertrand Russell).

It held the Guinness World Record for largest walk- through haunted attraction from 2005 until 2009, when it lost the record to Cutting Edge Haunted House. It is not recommended for children under the age of 13.  History  Erebus Haunted Attraction opened in 2000 in what was formerly an abandoned four-story parking garage in Pontiac, Michigan. The parking structure was abandoned for nearly 50 years and had been used as an indoor junkyard prior to Erebus moving in. The owners, Edward and Jim Terebus, had operated other haunted attractions around the Detroit area prior to Erebus, mainly portable haunts built out in trailers. In addition to Erebus, their first permanent attraction, they also publish Fear Finder, a seasonal publication, to serve as a central hub for all haunted houses in Michigan to advertise and allow the people interested to locate them easily.  Attraction  Erebus changes the basic effects and events from year to year, but the main theme stays the same. Patrons are sent through time by a scientist where they experience many different eras in history. The actors along the walkthrough push the boundaries of privacy and how to \\"touch\\" the visitors without actually laying a hand on anyone by utilizing props, animatronics, and massive puppets. In one of the events, a dragon comes out from the gloom and eats the patron. Some of the other effects utilize mirrors, and include a moving wall pushing patrons toward a bottomless pit, as well as burying them alive.  Features  The Metro Detroit area is home to many haunted and Halloween attractions, including Erebus. Erebus occupies and uses of that for storing props. The haunted attraction occupies multiple stories including an elevator. The production hires about 90 actors as well as uses animatronics resembling animals and monsters. Erebus uses these animatronics to bypass the ‚Äúno-touch‚Äù safety rules, as well as other techniques such as dropping fake bugs from the ceiling and making building structures move. Erebus also uses landscape changes throughout the walk-through including inclines, stairwells, narrow passages, low ceilings and trap doors. Additionally, Erebus mounts electronic props such as lasers, lights, and mirrors to create visual obstruction and manipulation. Unique in haunted attractions, Erebus has an illuminated scoreboard tracking \\"wimps\\" and \\"wetters\\".  Awards  * 2005‚Äì09: This four- story attraction was entered into the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"World's Largest Walk-Through Haunted Attraction\\" (2189 linear feet). * 2009: Click on Detroit voted Erebus the \\"#1 Best Haunted House in Pontiac\\". * 2010: Rated Number 1 as United States' best haunted house *2015: #8 scariest, biggest and best haunted houses See also *  References  Haunted attractions (simulated) Tourist attractions in Michigan ","title":"Erebus haunted attraction"},{"id":"36020303","text":"North Andover is an unincorporated community in the town of Beetown, Grant County, Wisconsin, United States.

It was loosely based on Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, updated to a modern setting. The series evolved from a stage play by Plater, \\"Trinity Tales or The Road to Wembley\\", which was performed by the Birmingham Repertory Theatre Company from 30 January 1975 to 22 February 1975.Birmingham Box Scenario A bus carrying supporters of rugby league club Wakefield Trinity is on its way from Wakefield to a Challenge Cup Final at London's Wembley Stadium. To pass the time each of the characters on the bus tells a story. The teller of the best tale will win a free fish-and-chip supper provided by \\"Stan the Fryer\\", a chip shop proprietor. Along with Stan, the travellers are Nick, the bus driver, \\"Smith, the Man of Law\\" (a policeman), \\"Alice, the wife of Batley\\", \\"Dave the Joiner\\", his girlfriend \\"Judy the Judy\\" and a writer referred to as \\"Eric the prologue\\". On the way they stop off at several pubs. At one stop-off point they pick up the pub's lugubrious landlord, Reuben. Commentary Names such as \\"Stan the Fryer\\" and the \\"Wife of Batley\\" are parodies of the names of the Chaucerian characters, the Wife of Bath and the Huberd the Friar. The figure of Chaucer himself is replaced by the writer Eric.Janet Moat, Screen Online, Trinity Tales (1975) Plater adapted five of the original stories: the Miller's Tale, the Wife of Bath's tale, the Reeve's Tale, the Knight's Tale and the Franklin's Tale. Another story begun by Eric is cut off by the other pilgrims for being boring, just like Chaucer's tale of Sir Thopas in the original. The tales are told in ways that parody TV and film clich√©s of the era.Hunt, Albert, \\"Alan Plater\\", in British Television Drama, Cambridge University Press, 1981, pp.148-154. Thus The Man of Law's Tale, is a pastiche of 1973 film, The Sting, and Eric's unfinished tale is told in the style of an arty film noir. The actors playing the \\"pilgrims\\" also perform the roles of the characters in the various tales, usually reflecting the personality of their pilgrim. The tales typically involve techniques such as breaking the narrative with songs, and comic Brechtian alienation devices, including characters commenting on their own roles in the story. Episodes The tales were first broadcast from 21 November to 26 December 1975 on BBC2. The series was repeated in 1977.BFI Trinity Tales *The Driver's Tale - 21 November 1975: Con- man \\"Big George\\" attempts to swindle rugby fans by selling tickets for a non- existent trip to Wembley. *The Fryer's Tale - 28 November 1975: Arthur, a weedy youth, is in love with Dorothy, the wife of rich man.

It was in the historic Agincourt Square neighbourhood. Prior to its conversion to a public house, the building served as the premises of an apothecary. During the early nineteenth century, the Crown and Thistle Inn briefly housed one of the earliest Masonic Lodges in Monmouthshire. History and location The Crown and Thistle Inn, a public house in Monmouth, was located on the north side of Agincourt Square, near the site of a previous bull ring. The building stood on the ground which is now the entrance to Priory Street. Prior to its use as a public house, the Crown and Thistle Inn had been occupied by an apothecary. The house, located on the bank of the River Monnow, had been the premises for many years of the apothecary, a Mr. Morgan. Later, Morgan's son was the proprietor of the business. The building was eventually redeveloped as a public house, the Crown and Thistle Inn. During the course of making improvements to the property, a Mr. Powell removed a stone with an attached ring. That area of Agincourt Square was referred to as the Bull Ring. Author Charles Heath indicated that it had been the custom to tie a bull to the ring, and that previous Monmouth residents had availed themselves of a \\"cruel diversion.\\" Author William Meyler Warlow indicated that the townspeople had \\"enjoyed the cruel sport of bull-baiting.\\" Dogs were bred to attack a restrained bull around the face, biting and hanging on until exhausted. The practice of bull-baiting was outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. Mr. Powell was the liquor purveyor at the Crown and Thistle Inn at the time that the improvements to the property were made. Later, in 1804, the proprietor of the inn was a Mr. Barlow. In the mid-nineteenth century, Pigot's Directory of 1844, under the listing of \\"Taverns & Public Houses,\\" indicated that the proprietor of the Crown and Thistle in Agincourt Square was Charles Edwards. In his 1804 account of the history of Monmouth, Heath offered his opinion that a visitor to the town would find no better establishment in which to partake of refreshments than the Crown and Thistle Inn, with particular regard to its garden in the summer. He painted a charming picture of the public house's garden, recommending it for its proximity to the sounds of the River Monnow, and its view of the local landscape. A visitor could admire the forests, meadows, and cornfields, his vantage point also permitting an appreciation of the setting sun. The National Library of Wales contains an 1808 print (pictured), drawn by artist John Nixon (1760-1818) and engraved by Samuel Rawle (1771-1860). The early nineteenth-century, black and white engraving is entitled \\"The Town Hall & principal street in Monmouth, from the Crown & Thistle Inn.\\" The scene of Agincourt Square includes people, a horse, and a cart in the foreground. Midground, to the left, the Shire Hall is illustrated. Multiple other buildings are demonstrated as well, including the King's Head Inn to the right, in the background. Freemasonry at the inn The oldest surviving Masonic Lodge in Monmouthshire is the Loyal Monmouth Lodge No. 457, established in 1839, initially as Lodge No. 671. The lodge still has its meetings in Monmouth, at Monk Street's Masonic Hall, the first building in Monmouthshire to be utilized mainly for Masonic purposes. However, one of the earliest Masonic Lodges in Monmouthshire had its meetings at the Crown and Thistle Inn, but the lodge didn't survive. This appears to represent the same lodge mentioned in a September 2000 lecture given by Andrew Prescott of the Centre for Research into Freemasonry. On 2 January 1815, Royal Augustus Lodge No. 656 received its warrant to assemble at the Crown and Thistle Inn. On 22 April 1815, the Monmouth lodge was consecrated. Trevor Philpotts was Master of the lodge during most of the time that it existed. The door to the room in the upper level of the Crown and Thistle Inn that was utilized for early lodge meetings was embellished with Masonic symbols that were still visible in the 1920s. The Freemason of 13 August 1892 reported that the Royal Augustus Lodge No. 656 was created in 1814 at the Crown and Thistle Inn and disbanded in 1830. Another record confirms the 1815 dates for the lodge and indicates that it transferred to the King's Head Inn in 1816. The Royal Augustus Lodge was removed from the Roll of Lodges on 1 December 1830.

Two examples were built but the type was not adopted for service. Design and development The American aviation pioneer George Dyott learned to fly in 1911, and after an extensive tour of North America, designed a small single-seat monoplane, the Dyott monoplane, which he had built by Hewlett & Blondeau of London in early 1913.Mason 1994, p. 70.Bruce 1957, p. 216. In 1914, Dyott designed a large twin-engined biplane for exploration in South Africa. The design and its potential for use as a long-range bomber attracted the attention of the British Royal Naval Air Service, and Dyott modified the design for military use, with an order for two prototypes placed with Hewlett & Blondeau. As completed the Dyott Bomber was a four-bay tractor biplane with equal-span wings. It was powered by two Beardmore 120 hp water-cooled six-cylinder engines which were mounted, without cowlings, between the wings. The aircraft had a fixed nosewheel undercarriage, with the nosewheel balanced by a large tailskid. It carried a crew of three, with a pilot and two gunners, in nose and dorsal positions.Bruce 1957, p. 217.Lewis 1980, pp. 64‚Äì65. The first prototype, serial number 3687, made its maiden flight at Chingford in August 1916, with the second prototype, serial number 3688 following in September. It proved to be underpowered and was fitted with BHP engines, while the forward fuselage was deepened.

He rose through the ranks of a group known for counterfeiting, extortion and murder during the 70's and 80's. A former boxer turned drug dealer, McElroy was known for being the driver of the infamous \\"meat wagon\\" (a large van used by the mob to transport dismembered body parts). Under control of Jimmy Coonan he became the third highest-ranking member of the Westies during that time. In 1990 he testified against John Gotti to get a reduction in his racketeering charges, stating that he acted on orders from the Gambino Boss when assaulting a Carpenter's Union official three blocks down from the Hudson River piers. Gotti was acquitted on all charges and McElroy spent the rest of his life in prison. Death In May 2011 McElroy died in federal custody, his body was transferred to New York where a funeral procession was held at The Church of the Holy Cross in the renamed Clinton neighborhood.

It is a generalization of the logistic distribution that was introduced by D. G. Champernowne. Section 7.3 \\"Champernowne Distribution.\\" Champernowne developed the distribution to describe the logarithm of income. Definition The Champernowne distribution has a probability density function given by : f(y;\\\\alpha, \\\\lambda, y_0 ) = \\\\frac{n}{\\\\cosh[\\\\alpha(y - y_0)] + \\\\lambda}, \\\\qquad -\\\\infty < y < \\\\infty, where \\\\alpha, \\\\lambda, y_0 are positive parameters, and n is the normalizing constant, which depends on the parameters. The density may be rewritten as : f(y) = \\\\frac{n}{1/2 e^{\\\\alpha(y-y_0)} + \\\\lambda + 1/2 e^{-\\\\alpha(y-y_0)}}, using the fact that \\\\cosh y = (e^y + e^{-y})/2. Properties The density f(y) defines a symmetric distribution with median y0, which has tails somewhat heavier than a normal distribution. Special cases In the special case \\\\lambda=1 it is the Burr Type XII density. When y_0 = 0, \\\\alpha=1, \\\\lambda=1 , : f(y) = \\\\frac{1}{e^y + 2 + e^{-y}} = \\\\frac{e^y}{(1+e^y)^2}, which is the density of the standard logistic distribution.  Distribution of income  If the distribution of Y, the logarithm of income, has a Champernowne distribution, then the density function of the income X = exp(Y) is : f(x) = \\\\frac{n}{x [1/2(x/x_0)^{-\\\\alpha} + \\\\lambda + a/2(x/x_0)^\\\\alpha ]}, \\\\qquad x > 0, where x0 = exp(y0) is the median income. If Œª = 1, this distribution is often called the Fisk distribution, which has density : f(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\alpha x^{\\\\alpha - 1}}{x_0^\\\\alpha [1 + (x/x_0)^\\\\alpha]^2}, \\\\qquad x > 0.

After joining Petrocaribe, Haiti followed Venezuela's opinion in foreign policy assemblies‚Äìoften opposing United States policies‚Äìand began to rely on Venezuela's cheap petroleum prices for economic development. Following the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Venezuela made substantial contributions to the humanitarian response to the earthquake, pledging $1.3bn in aid in addition to cancelling $395m in Petrocaribe debt.

Employed Civilians Weekly Hours US Bureau of Labor Statistics Typically, cash compensation consists of a wage or salary, and may include commissions or bonuses. Benefits consist of retirement plans, health insurance, life insurance, disability insurance, vacation, employee stock ownership plans, etc. Compensation can be fixed and/or variable, and is often both. Variable pay is based on the performance of the employee. Commissions, incentives, and bonuses are forms of variable pay. Benefits can also be divided into company-paid and employee- paid. Some, such as holiday pay, vacation pay, etc., are usually paid for by the firm. Others are often paid, at least in part, by employees‚Äîa notable example is medical insurance. Compensation in the US (as in all countries) is shaped by law, tax policy, and history. Health insurance is a common employee benefit because there is no government-sponsored national health insurance in the United States, and premiums are deductible on personal income tax. 401(k) accounts are a common employer organized program for retirement savings because of their tax benefits.

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes a minimum wage at the federal level that all states must abide by, among other provisions. Fourteen states and a number of cities have set their own minimum wage rates that are higher than the federal level. For certain federal or state government contracts, employers must pay the so-called prevailing wage as determined according to the Davis-Bacon Act or its state equivalent. Activists have undertaken to promote the idea of a living wage rate which accounts for living expenses and other basic necessities, setting the living wage rate much higher than current minimum wage laws require. \\"The FLSA requires that most employees in the United States be paid at least the federal minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime pay at time and one-half the regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 hours in a workweek.\\" Salaries In the United States, the distinction between periodic salaries (which are normally paid regardless of hours worked) and hourly wages (meeting a minimum wage test and providing for overtime) was first codified by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Five categories were identified as being \\"exempt\\" from minimum wage and overtime protections, and therefore salariable‚Äîexecutive, administrative, professional, computer, and outside sales employees.Section 13(a)(1) of the FLSA Salary is generally set on a yearly basis. (These employees must be paid on a salary basis above a certain level, $455 per week as of 2012, though some professions -- \\"Outside Sales Employee\\", teachers and practitioners of law or medicine‚Äîare exempt from that requirement.http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/fairpay/main.htm DOL's FairPay Overtime Initiative) Executive compensation \\"Executive compensation\\" has its own set of regulations and lacks many of the tax benefits of other employee compensation because it exceeds their income limits. Equity compensation=Employee stock options Employee stock options are call options on the common stock of a company. Their value increases as the company's stock rises. Employee stock options are mostly offered to management with restrictions on the option (such as vesting and limited transferability), in an attempt to align the holder's interest with those of the business shareholders. Options may also be offered to non- executive level staff, especially by businesses that are not yet profitable, insofar as they may have few other means of compensation. They may also be remuneration for non-employees: suppliers, consultants, lawyers, and promoters for services rendered. There is usually a period before the employee can \\"vest\\", i.e. sell or transfer the stock or options. Vesting may be granted all at once (\\"cliff vesting\\") or over a period time (\\"graded vesting\\"), in which case it may be \\"uniform\\" (e.g. 20% of the options vest each year for 5 years) or \\"non-uniform\\" (e.g. 20%, 30%, and 50% of the options vest each year for the next three years). =Types of employee stock options= In the U.S., stock options granted to employees are of two forms, that differ primarily in their tax treatment. They may be either: *Incentive stock options (ISOs) *Non- qualified stock options (NQSOs or NSOs) Other equity-based compensation Besides stock options, other forms of individual equity compensation include: *restricted stock - Stock that cannot be sold by the owner until certain conditions are met (usually a certain length of time passing (vesting period) or a certain goal achieved, such as reaching financial targetsRestricted Stock FAQ Frequently Asked Questions by F.

As with phantom stock, it's normally paid out in cash, but may be paid in shares. *phantom stock - A promise to pay a bonus in the form of the equivalent of either the value of company shares or the increase in that value over a period of time.Phantom Stock and Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) *employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) =Taxation of employee stock options in the United States= Because most employee stock options are non-transferable and are not immediately exercisable though they can be readily hedged to reduce risk, the IRS considers that their \\"fair market value\\" cannot be \\"readily determined\\", and therefore \\"no taxable event\\" occurs when an employee receives an option grant. Depending on the type of option granted, the employee may or may not be taxed upon exercise. Non- qualified stock options (those most often granted to employees) are taxed upon exercise. Incentive stock options (ISO) are not, assuming that the employee complies with certain additional tax code requirements. Most importantly, shares acquired upon exercise of ISOs must be held for at least one year after the date of exercise if the favorable capital gains tax are to be achieved. However, taxes can be delayed or reduced by avoiding premature exercises and holding them until near expiration day and hedging along the way. The taxes applied when hedging are friendly to the employee/optionee. =Generally accepted accounting principles= According to US generally accepted accounting principles in effect before June 2005, stock options granted to employees did not need to be recognized as an expense on the income statement when granted, although the cost was disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. This allows a potentially large form of employee compensation to not show up as an expense in the current year, and therefore, currently overstate income. Many assert that over-reporting of income by methods such as this by American corporations was one contributing factor in the Stock Market Downturn of 2002. Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation This item of the profit-and-loss (P&L;) statement of companies' earnings reports is due to the different timing of option expense recognition between the GAAP P&L; and how the IRS deals with it, and the resulting difference between estimated and actual tax deductions. At the time the options are awarded, GAAP requires an estimate of their value to be run through the P&L; as an expense. This lowers operating income and GAAP taxes. However, the IRS treats option expense differently, and only allows their tax deductibility at the time the options are exercised/expire and the true cost is known. This means that cash taxes in the period the options are expensed are higher than GAAP taxes. The delta goes into a deferred income tax asset on the balance sheet. When the options are exercised/expire, their actual cost becomes known and the precise tax deduction allowed by the IRS can then be determined. There is then a balancing up event. If the original estimate of the options' cost was too low, there will be more tax deduction allowed than was at first estimated. This 'excess' is run through the P&L; in the period when it becomes known (i.e. the quarter in which the options are exercised). It raises net income (by lowering taxes) and is subsequently deducted out in the calculation of operating cashflow because it relates to expenses/earnings from a prior period. Benefits The term \\"fringe benefits\\" was coined by the War Labor Board during World War II to describe the various indirect benefits which industry had devised to attract and retain labor when direct wage increases were prohibited. Employee benefits in the United States might include relocation assistance; medical, prescription, vision and dental plans; health and dependent care flexible spending accounts; retirement benefit plans (pension, 401(k), 403(b)); group-term life and long term care insurance plans; legal assistance plans; adoption assistance; child care benefits; transportation benefits; and possibly other miscellaneous employee discounts (e.g., movies and theme park tickets, wellness programs, discounted shopping, hotels and resorts, and so on). Companies provide benefits that go beyond a base salary figure for a number of reasons: To raise productivity and lower turnover by raising employee satisfaction and corporate loyalty, take advantage of deductions, credits in the tax code.Abenity: What Is An Employee Discount Program? Wellness programs can also lower health insurance costs. Many employer-provided cash benefits (below a certain income level) are tax- deductible to the employer and non-taxable to the employee. Some fringe benefits (for example, accident and health plans, and group-term life insurance coverage (up to US$50,000) (and employer provided meals and lodging in-kindSection 119(a)), may be excluded from the employee's gross income and, therefore, are not subject to federal income tax in the United States. Some function as tax shelters (for example, flexible spending accounts, 401(k)'s, 403(b)'s). Fringe benefits are also thought of as the costs of keeping employees other than salary. These benefit rates are typically calculated using fixed percentages that vary depending on the employee‚Äôs classification and often change from year to year. Executive benefits (e.g. golden handshake and golden parachute plans), exceed this level and are taxable. from US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Compensation Survey (NCS), March 2011EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IN THE UNITED STATES ‚ÄìMARCH 2011 Benefits for workers earning wages in the highest and lowest 10th percent of private industry employees. From US Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, National Compensation Survey (NCS), March 2011 Full-time and high wage workers are much more likely to have benefits, as the charts to the right indicates. Benefits can be divided into as company-paid and employee-paid. Some, such as holiday pay, vacation pay, etc., are usually paid for by the firm. Others, are often paid, at least in part, by employees. A notable example is medical insurance, which has risen in cost dramatically in recent decades and been shifted to employees by many American employers. Even when paid entirely by employees, these programs may still provide value to employees and be called benefits because their cost may be considerably lower than that of equivalent non-employer-sponsored programs, thanks to employers having negotiated discounts with providers. Some benefits, such as unemployment and worker's compensation, are federally required and arguably can be considered a right, rather than a benefit.Employee Benefits and Compensation (Employee Pay) American corporations often offer cafeteria plans to their employees. These plans would offer a menu and level of benefits for employees to choose from. In most instances, these plans are funded by both the employees and by the employer(s). The portion paid by the employees is deducted from their gross pay before federal and state taxes are applied. Some benefits would still be subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA), such as 401(k)https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc424.html and 403(b) contributions; however, health premiums, some life premiums, and contributions to flexible spending accounts are exempt from FICA. Perks The term perks is often used colloquially to refer to those benefits of a more discretionary nature. Often, perks are given to employees who are doing notably well and/or have seniority. Common perks are take-home vehicles, hotel stays, free refreshments, leisure activities on work time (golf, etc.), stationery, allowances for lunch, and--when multiple choices exist--first choice of such things as job assignments and vacation scheduling. They may also be given first chance at job promotions when vacancies exist. Pensions Traditional pensions, known as Defined benefit pension plans, provides employees with a guaranteed paycheck (or lump sum) in retirement.401(k)‚Äôs: What You Need to Know. By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD nytimes.com 16 December 2008 The benefit is usually \\"defined\\" by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, and not depending on investment returns. Because of the high cost and responsibility of the employer to finance the plan, in recent years many companies have phased out their pension plans sometimes replacing them with defined contribution deferred compensation plans, which are defined by contribution. Deferred compensation=Qualifying and non- qualifying Deferred compensation is any arrangement where an employee receives wages after they have earned them. Deferred compensation plans in the US often have the benefit of employers' matching all or part of the employee contribution. In the US, Internal Revenue Code section 409A regulates the treatment for federal income tax purposes of ‚Äúnonqualified deferred compensation‚Äù, the timing of deferral elections and of distributions.Frequently Asked Questions: Sec. 409A and Deferred Compensation Qualifying A \\"qualifying\\" deferred compensation plan is one complying with the ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Qualifying plans include 401(k) (for non-government organizations), 403(b) (for public education employers), 501(c)(3) (for non-profit organizations and ministers), and 457(b) (for state and local government organizations) Most medium-sized and large companies offer 401(k)‚Äôs. ERISA, has many regulations, one of which is how much employee income can qualify. In an ERISA-qualified plan (like a 401(k) plan), the company's contribution to the plan is tax deductible to the plan as soon as it's made, but not taxable to the individual participants until it's withdrawn. So if a company puts $1,000,000 into a 401(k) plan for employees, it writes off $1,000,000 that year. If the company is in the 25% bracket, the contribution costs it only $750,000 (with $250,000 saved in taxes). Employee benefits provided through ERISA are not subject to state-level insurance regulation like most insurance contracts, but employee benefit products provided through insurance contracts are regulated at the state level.Ford J. (1995). State-Mandated Employee Benefits: Conflict with Federal Law?. Monthly Labor Review. However, ERISA does not generally apply to plans by governmental entities, churches for their employees, and some other situations.U.S. DOL. Health Plans & Benefits Employee Retirement Income Security Act ‚Äî ERISA. The tax benefits in qualifying plans were intended to encourage lower-to-middle income earners to save more, high income-earners already having high savings rates. As of 2008 the maximum qualifying annual income was $230,000. So, for example, if a company declared a 25% profit sharing contribution, any employee making less than $230,000 could deposit the entire amount of their profit sharing check (up to $57,500, 25% of $230,000) in their ERISA-qualifying account. For the company CEO making $1,000,000/year, $57,500 would be less than 1/4 of his $250,000 profit sharing cut. It is for high earners like the CEO, that companies provide \\"DC\\" (i.e. deferred compensation plans). Non-qualifying A Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation (NQDC) plan is a written agreement between an employer and an employee where the employee voluntarily agrees to have part of their compensation withheld by the company, invested on their behalf, and given to them at some pre-specified point in the future.Non Qualified Deferred Compensation NQDC refers to a specific part of the tax code that provides a special benefit to corporate executives and other highly compensated corporate employees. Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation is also sometimes referred to as deferred comp (which technically would include qualifying deferred comp but the more common use of the phrase does not), DC, non-qualified deferred comp, NQDC or golden handcuffs. \\"Most large companies\\" have a NQDC that takes compensation until some future date. Income tax is deferred until the recipient receives payment. Depending on the firm and employee, DC can be optional or mandatory, contributions may come only from salary, or may allow gains from stock options. At some firms it is mandatory for all salary in excess of $1 million/year. The benefit feature of NQDC plans vary. Some plans provide matching contributions, which can be awarded at the boards discretion or by a formula. The contributions in the plan may earn a guaranteed minimum rate of \\"investment,\\" or at a premium over the market rate.Pay Without Performance - the Unfulfilled Promise of Executive Compensation by Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Harvard University Press 2004 (p.102) Nonqualifying differs from qualifying in that #Employers may also pick and choose which employees they provide deferred compensation benefits to rather than being required to offer the same plan to all employees. #NQDC has the flexibility to treat different employees differently. The benefit promised need not follow any of the rules associated with qualified plans (e.g. the 25% or $44,000 limit on contributions to defined contribution plans). The vesting schedule can be whatever the employer would like it to be. #Companies may provide deferred compensation benefits to independent contractors, not just employees. #The employer contributions are not tax deductible #Employees must pay taxes on deferred compensation at the time such compensation is eligible to be received (not just when it is actually drawn out).IRS Limits for Deferred Compensation Deferred comp is only available to senior management and other highly compensated employees of companies. Although DC isn't restricted to public companies, there must be a serious risk that a key employee could leave for a competitor and deferred comp is a \\"sweetener\\" to try to entice them to stay. If a company is closely held (i.e. owned by a family, or a small group of related people), the IRS will look much more closely at the potential risk to the company. #Assets in plans that fall under ERISA (for example, a 401(k) plan) must be put in a trust for a sole benefit of its employees. If a company goes bankrupt, creditors aren't allowed to get assets inside the company's ERISA plan. Deferred comp, because it doesn't fall under ERISA, is a general asset of the corporation. While the corporation may choose to not invade those assets as a courtesy, legally they're allowed to and may be forced to give deferred compensation assets to creditors in the case of a bankruptcy. A special kind of trust called a rabbi trust (because it was first used in the compensation plan for a rabbi) may be used. A rabbi trust puts a \\"fence\\" around the money inside the corporation and protects it from being raided for most uses other than the corporation's bankruptcy/insolvency. However, plan participants may not receive a guarantee that they'll be paid prior to creditors being paid in case of insolvency. #Federal income tax rates change frequently. Deferred compensation has tax benefits if the income tax rates are lower when the compensation is withdrawn then when it was \\"deposited\\" (i.e. at the time it was deferred), and tax disadvantages if the reverse is true. Deferred comp agreements Plans are usually put in place either at the request of executives or as an incentive by the Board of Directors. They're drafted by lawyers, recorded in the Board minutes with parameters defined. There's a doctrine called constructive receipt, which means an executive can't have control of the investment choices or the option to receive the money whenever he wants. If he's allowed to do either of those 2 things or both, he often has to pay taxes on it right away. Taxation In a deferred comp plan, unlike an ERISA (such as a 401(k)plan), the company doesn't get to deduct the taxes in the year the contribution is made, they deduct them the year the contribution becomes non-forfeitable. For example, if ABC company allows SVP John Smith to defer $200,000 of his compensation in 1990, which he will have the right to withdraw for the first time in the year 2000, ABC puts the money away for John in 1990, John pays taxes on it in 2000. If John keeps working there after 2000, it doesn't matter because he was allowed to receive it (or \\"constructively received\\") the money in 2000. Other circumstances around deferred comp. Most of the provisions around deferred comp are related to circumstances the employee's control (such as voluntary termination), however deferred comp often has a clause that says in the case of the employee's death or permanent disability, the plan will immediately vest and the employee (or estate) can get the money. Performance Linked Incentives Long-term incentives are paid five or at least three years out.The complete guide to executive compensation By Bruce R. Ellig, p.354 They are often a mixture of cash and shares of stock in the company, or some other type of equity compensation such as stock options, which are almost always subject to restrictions based on time, performance, or both, known as vesting.Executive Compensation: The Professional's Guide to Current Issues & Practices By Michael L. Davis, Edge, Jerry T., p.86 Clawback of \\"faithless servant\\" employee compensation Under the faithless servant doctrine, which is a doctrine under the laws of a number of states in the United States, and most notably New York State law, an employee who acts unfaithfully towards his or her employer must forfeit all compensation received during the period of disloyalty, which compensation is subject to clawback by the employer.

He was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  Life  Teixeira de Pascoaes was the second son (of seven) of Jo√£o Pereira Teixeira de Vasconcelos, a judge and deputy to the Courts, and of Carlota Guedes Monteiro. He was a solitary, introverted and sensitive child, very prone to the contemplation of Nature. In 1883, he began his primary studies in Amarante, and in 1887, he entered the Lyceum. In 1895, he moved to Coimbra, where he completed his secondary studies; in Amarante he was not a good student, even failing in Portuguese; and in 1896, he enrolled in the Law course of the Faculty of Law of the University of Coimbra. Unlike most of his comrades, he was not part of the Bohemian Coimbra, spending his time, monastically, in the bedroom, reading, writing and reflecting. In 1901, he reluctantly established himself as a lawyer, first in Amarante and, from 1906, in Porto. In 1911 he was appointed substitute judge in Amarante, a position that he held for two years. In 1913, with relief, he terminated his judicial career. On those painful years he will say, \\"I was a Dr. Joaquim in everyone's mouth, I needed to honor the title.\\" Being a wealthy landowner, he took up residence in the family manor in S√£o Jo√£o do Gat√£o, near Amarante, with his mother and other members of his family. He dedicated himself to the management of properties, to the tireless contemplation of nature and his beloved Serra do Mar√£o, to reading and especially to writing. Gat√£o became a place of pilgrimage of countless intellectuals and artists, national and foreign, who would visit him frequently. At the end of his life, he would be friends with the poets Eug√©nio de Andrade and M√°rio Cesariny de Vasconcelos. The latter would elect him as a poet superior to Fernando Pessoa, and organized reprinting of some of the Pascoal texts, as well as a poetic anthology, in the 1970s and 1980s. Pascoal died at 75 years old, in Gat√£o, in 1952.

The actor was selected from 200 people who had auditioned for the role and was contracted to appear for one month. Bancks soon joined the regular cast and Tug became a prominent character. Tug fills the role of the villain and is characterised by his \\"hardened, streetwise tough kid\\" image. The serial created a backstory consisting of a mother who abandoned him and an alcoholic father. Bancks has credited Tug's troubled childhood as the reason viewers were able to relate to him. Tug's storylines include bullying Damian Roberts (Matt Doran), behavioural issues, a feud with Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer), relationships with Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez) and his school teacher Beth Armstrong (Toni Pearen). The character has also been used to portray a suicide attempt. After a series of misdemeanours Tug instigates a car crash to end his life. Bancks researched the issue to help him play the scenes and subsequently felt depressed. In 1994, Bancks left Home and Away to pursue other projects. He believed that Tug no longer had material to play because he had used up \\"so many complicated storylines\\". Tug left the series in September that year. The character has been positively received by critics and viewers alike. Josephine Monroe writing for the TVTimes opined that Tug was \\"generally humiliated\\" throughout his tenure. Lisa Anthony from BIG! stated that Tug changed from \\"horrible\\" to \\"sloppy\\" through his romance with Sarah. Melissa Field said that Tug is always grumpy. Woman's Own reporter Mary Fletcher named him one of the show's \\"most interesting residents\\". Casting Bancks joined the cast of Home and Away in 1992 and he had previously undertaken a drama class which Bancks felt had well prepared him for the role. He was selected from 200 actors that auditioned for the role. Bancks felt that the \\"biggest thrill\\" of his career was when his agent informed him that he had secured the role. Bancks missed \\"muck-up day\\" at school because he was learning his scripts for his first episode and he began filming in March immediately after leaving school. Tug was originally only meant to be a guest character. Bancks signed a one-month contract with the serial when he was sixteen and was later promoted to the regular cast. Character development=Characterisation Tug is characterised as a \\"bad boy\\" teenager. Tempany Deckert who plays Selina Roberts described Tug as a \\"rough renegade\\" who had lost his way but \\"finally got back on the straight and narrow with the help of various foster parents\\". A writer from the show's official website described Tug as a \\"hardened, streetwise tough kid, who lived up to his nickname\\". Bancks told Monroe of TVTimes that he thought Tug \\"had a much harder time\\" in life because the writers decided upon a \\"such a silly name\\". Lisa Anthony from BIG! magazine reported that Tug would go \\"b-for-bonkers\\" at his headteacher Donald Fisher (Norman Coburn), burn his tie and walk out of the school. Bancks told Anthony that he sympathised with Tug because \\"everyone has problems at school\\" and added that he did not go to \\"the lengths\\" that Tug did. Bacnks explained to Ally Oliver from Inside Soap that Tug's persona changed through the writing. He \\"liked\\" the character when he first began portraying Tug's journey. \\"He was pretty tortured, but the writers softened him up a lot and it's difficult to play against the script your given.\\" While interviewed by Soap's Angie Taylor, the actor described Tug as being a character who \\"has to be tough and able to stand up for himself\\". But at the same time Tug remains likeable and sometimes he can be \\"very unlikeable\\". Bancks opined that there is always a need for a bad guy in certain parts of storylines. The fact that Tug's personality had mellowed was viewed as a positive change of character by Bancks. He explained to Taylor that it helped him play Tug and stated \\"I do like him and I like playing him because he's so far removed from myself. I can relate to the character - otherwise I wouldn't be able to play him - but he's very different to me.\\" Towards the end of Tug's tenure, Bancks had transformed a \\"troubled\\" character into a popular one that appealed to teenagers. Bancks opined that Tug's backstory was responsible for developing the connection with viewers; more so with those who had a difficult upbringing empathised with Tug. His mother conducted an affair and abandoned him with an alcoholic father who constantly disappointed him. Bancks concluded that \\"so many things have gone wrong for Tug that he's lost his self-confidence\\". Feud with Shane Parrish The serial developed a rivalry between Tug and Shane Parrish (Dieter Brummer), although, off-screen the pair became best friends. Their storyline began in 1992 when Tug frames Shane for a burglary and he vows to get revenge.Black 2009, p.26. Their feud was still prominent in 1993 when Tug discovers that Shane is planning to kiss his love interest Sarah Thompson (Laura Vasquez). In the book Home and Away ‚Äì Official Collector‚Äôs Edition, Andrea Black wrote that Tug is left \\"absolutely furious\\" by Shane's actions. But noted that it was all a ploy on Shane's behalf and Sarah did, in fact, love him.Black 2009, p.28.Black 2009, p.29. In 2008, Bancks said that some of his favourite scenes featured Brummer and their character's on-screen rivalry crossed over into real life. But Bancks said that he and Brummer approached their own in \\"more of a joking way\\". Inside Soap's Oliver wrote that Tug and Shane were always involved in battles but Bancks and Brummer were a \\"formidable pair\\" on the \\"teen scene\\" appearing on magazine covers alongside one another as a result of the storyline. Relationship with Sarah Thompson Tug had long been portrayed as having an interest in Sarah. Bancks told a reporter from Look-in that Tug \\"took a liking to her the moment he saw her, and he was really surprised that she liked him too. It's not often someone breaks through Tug's tough exterior like Sarah has.\\" Vasquez added that Sarah immediately thought that Tug was \\"cute\\" and \\"she liked the way he treated her too. He was a known troublemaker but she saw the softer side of him.\\" As Tug and Sarah's relationship progressed they share a kiss. The scenes were Vasquez's first to involve kissing and she felt \\"really nervous\\" but it turned out to be \\"really easy\\". The on-screen duo would soon be engaged in many \\"snogging scenes\\", but their first kiss was filmed during the Australian school holidays. Vasquez told BIG!'s Lisa Anthony that filming the embrace proved \\"quite nerve-racking\\" due to an entire \\"circle of school kids\\" surrounding them. Already feeling nervous, an audience made the actors feel worse during the shoot. It was a \\"nightmare situation\\" for Bancks who had found it strange to kiss in front of \\"seven hundred thousand people\\". Tug fans were already hassling Bancks having sensed a kiss with Sarah was imminent. Tug and Sarah get engaged but after an argument, Sarah hands Tug the engagement ring back. Vasquez felt that it happened because Tug did not have a good upbringing and as a result he is \\"unsure of himself\\". She still hoped for a future for the two characters because Tug needs attention and Sarah is always there to give him understanding. She concluded that while they are two different people, they get on well with each other. Sarah begins to date Nathan Roberts (David Dixon). Dixon told Richard Galpin from BIG! magazine that Tug initially \\"hates\\" and then \\"loves\\" Nathan. But through Sarah he ends up hating him once again. In one scene Tug and Nathan get into a fight over Sarah. Dixon said \\"we had one scene where I had to call Tug a jerk and then he'd give me a gentle push back. When we came to do it for real, instead of a gentle tap, he gave me a huge shove and I was like, 'Hey that really hurt mate'\\". Dixon suspected that a relationship between the two made Bancks push him harder. Following his break-up with Sarah, Tug loses his job and she tells him that their relationship is over for good. The series of events impact negatively on Tug and he becomes \\"despairing and suicidal\\". He takes a car and drives it into a telegraph pole and is hospitalised. Bancks told Fletcher that he could understand how Tug felt and his predicament was made worse without any parents to offer guidance. Bancks carried out research such as watching a programme based on teenage suicide. The experience made Bancks feel depressed the more he studied the issue. Tug and Sarah romance became popular and Fletcher from Woman's Own said that had become one of the show's \\"hottest couples\\". Bancks told Fletcher that \\"spending eight hours a day as [the] teenage sweethearts\\" Tug and Sarah had created a mutual attraction between himself and Vaquez. The pair were pictured as a couple in magazines and wrote stories about them. This annoyed producers because they felt that it was spoiling the image Home and Away had created and the actors quickly denied a relationship. Relationship with Beth Armstrong Tristan Bancks (pictured) filmed his final scenes as Tug in 1994.In 1994 Toni Pearen was cast as new teacher Beth Armstrong. Photographers from BIG! magazine visited Pearen to take promotional shots. They revealed that she is Tug's teacher and that the two characters would \\"snog\\" on-screen. A writer from Inside Soap reported that romance was \\"blossoming for luckless Tug\\" and Beth. However, another teacher, Luke warns his \\"smitten\\" colleague that pursuing a relationship with Tug will ruin her career. When Tug and Beth share a \\"romantic dinner\\" together and she realises that \\"sparks are indeed flying\\" between them. She is left with the decision of choosing Tug or her career. A reporter from Inside Soap noted that this was a \\"scandal\\" storyline and Tug and Beth's romance rocked Summer Bay. Tug and Beth begin spending time together when she is assigned to give him private lessons. Beth attempts to deny her feelings but soon succumbs to temptation. Pearen explained to Ally Oliver from Inside Soap that the relationship develops because Beth is \\"really lonely, she's got a new job in a brand new town and she doesn't have any friends\\". They attempt to keep their romance a secret, especially from their headmaster Donald, though their relationship is later exposed. Pearen said that other characters ask Beth to control her \\"desire\\" for Tug. But as she noted it was \\"much too late\\" for that to happen. Departure Tug was written out of the series in 1994. A writer from TV Week first reported that Tug had been axed alongside the characters of Sarah, Luke Cunningham (John Adam) and Roxanne Miller (Lisa Lackey). They added that producers did not inform them and their report was the first they would know of their departures. Lackey later denied the claims, but Bancks confirmed he was leaving. Bancks told Fiona Parker and David Hancock from the Daily Mirror that he had a great two and half years working on Home and Away, but was content in pursuing other projects. Bancks told Soap's Taylor that Tug would depart the show in September 1994 and admitted he was not sure how he would leave. But he revealed that Tug would not be killed off. Taylor stated that this was due to the other characters leaving around the same time. She added that \\"producers are anxious not to go over the top with the storylines and do anything overly dramatic\\". When his exit storyline played out on-screen he was depicted leaving Summer Bay on a tractor. The actor later told Josephine Monroe from TVTimes that he hoped to never return to the show. Storylines Tug transfers to Summer Bay High and begins bullying Damian Roberts (Matt Doran). Damian's friends Blake Dean (Les Hill) and Simon Fitzgerald (Richard Norton) warn Tug and physically threaten him. Tug continues his harassment campaign against Damian which leads to a fight which Damian wins after Blake and Simon secretly force Tug to deliberately lose. Tug challenges Damian to a rematch, which he refuses and when Tug tries to prevent him from leaving, Damian breaks his nose. Tug reappears when his father Roy's (Mervyn Drake) bear traps injure Damian's friend Shane. Roy is later arrested and jailed for stealing from Michael Ross' (Dennis Coard) boatshed. Tug, angry at Shane, frames him for robbery by burgling the house where Shane is doing community service for a prior joyriding offence. Shane is then arrested and sent to Juvenile detention. Bobby Marshall (Nicolle Dickson) realises the truth and urges Tug to confess. Shane is released and Tug is given 40 hours community service. Sarah Thompson arrives in Summer Bay and Tug becomes attracted to her. However, Tug ruins his chances when he plasters old swimsuit photos of his teacher Roxanne around school. Tug later apologises and Sarah sees another side of him and they begin dating. The relationship hits a snag when Tug's aunt Mavis (Mary Haire) decides to move away and wants him to come with her. Tug tries to find a local family to stay with in order for him to continue his schooling but nobody is willing. Sarah then moves in with Alf (Ray Meagher) and Ailsa Stewart (Judy Nunn) while Tug takes her old room at Bobby's place. Bobby's husband Greg Marshall (Ross Newton) is not keen on him staying but changes his mind when Tug saves Sarah's life after she suffers an asthma attack in the bush. When Sarah is cast in the lead role of the school musical, Tug is concerned that she will be starring opposite Shane. After unsuccessfully auditioning himself, he takes a job as a prompt. Tug's jealousy causes a temporary split with Sarah and he begins spending time with Michelle Carter (Zoe Emmanuel). Sarah forgives him and Tug apologises to Shane, only for Shane to tease him about kissing Sarah. On the night of the performance, Shane overdoes the kiss and Tug storms the stage and punches him, ruining the play. Sarah dumps Tug, but they later agree to be friends. Bobby is killed in a boating accident and Greg leaves for Queensland, leaving Tug worried that he will be homeless but Luke and Roxy move into the Beach House. Damian's brother Nathan is released from prison and begins dating Sarah, much to his disapproval. Tug then drops out of school and applies to be the janitor but is beaten to the position by Nathan. Things look up when Roy (now played by Russell Kiefel) is released from prison and asks him to move back to the farm. When a water source is found on their land, the O'Neales celebrate. Things turn sour when a drunken Roy gropes Sarah during the celebrations, forcing Tug to punch him. Roy then leaves ashamed the next day. Tug considers leaving too, until, Shane persuades him to stay. In spite of this, Tug's behaviour worsens and he steals Roxy's car and crashes it. He is handed a three-month sentence which is later overturned. Tug returns to school and is tutored privately by Beth. He soon develops feelings for her but Beth rebuffs him. Tug realises nothing can happen while Beth is his tutor and assumes they will get together after he leaves school. When Beth accepts a date with Nick he feels she is cheating on him. Beth then decides to leave town and she and Tug share an emotional goodbye. Sarah's father, Matthew (Jeff Truman) arrives to stay at The Stewarts. He and Tug strike up a close bond which leads Matthew to see Tug and Sarah as a perfect match. Sarah persuades Tug to play up in front of Matthew to try and dissuade him, which annoys Matthew when he discovers. However, Matthew still offers Tug a job helping to run his farm. Tug accepts and leaves the Bay. In 2002, Alf mentions that Tug and Sarah have since married and they are expecting their second child. Reception Melissa Field from BIG! said that Tug was always \\"so grumpy\\" because he was named after a \\"small water craft\\". Kilmeny Adie from the Illawarra Mercury said that Bancks \\"made a name for himself in 1992\\" being Home and Away's \\"heart-throb\\". A writer from Inside Soap said that the storyline in which Tug brings a stray cow home and teaches Irene to milk it had \\"hilarious results\\". While another columnist from the publication said that \\"Tug does his best to look tough and streetwise in front of his girlfriend, [but] he fails to save face when he finally meets his wayward father.\\" They added that the combination of finding his father and Shane goading him over the time he spent with Sarah during rehearsals for their school musical; result in Tug hitting an \\"all time low\\". The two episodes featuring the school musical where Tug's feud with Shane reaches a climax were nominated for \\"Best Episode in a Television Drama Serial\\" at the Australian Film Institute awards in 1993. Kate Langbroek writing for The Age branded the Tug as one of the show's \\"resident dope\\" characters. Monroe from TVTimes said that \\"Tug O'Neale's had a hard time of it in Home and Away. He's tried suicide, lost the family farm and been generally humiliated in Summer Bay.\\" In Fletcher's article in Woman's Own she opined that Bancks \\"turned the troubled Tug into one of Summer Bay's most interesting residents, with a huge following of young fans.\\" BIG!'s Anthony opined that \\"horrible old Tug\\" turned \\"soppy\\" once he became involved with Sarah. She added that no would have believed Tug would stop \\"terrorising Shane, beating up people, and generally being obnoxious\\".

He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 June 1996. O'Han joined the serial while he was still in high school and was assisted by an on-set tutor. His decision to quit the serial three years later was based on the decision to concentrate on his education. Joey departed on 11 May 1999. Joey's storylines involve him leaving his mother Melanie Rainbow (Mercia Deane Johns) and father Saul Bennett's (David Ritchie) commune in order to learn more about the wider world and find acceptance in Summer Bay, gaining a new home with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). He befriends Liam Tanner (Peter Scarf), Casey Mitchell (Rebecca Croft) and Stephanie Mboto (Fleur Beaupert). He tries to initiate a relationship with Casey but she rejects him. O'han described Joey as \\"naive and innocent\\", also \\"nerdy\\" and is better at winning school quizzes than female attention. Later storylines see Joey begin a relationship with Tiegan Brook (Sally Marrett), work as a beautician's assistant for Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) and develop schizophrenia while taking his HSC. O'Han told the Sun-Herald, he found the storyline challenging and did some research into mental illness. He shortly became the face of SANE Australia's mental health campaign and the storyline was positive received, resulting in a 100% increase in phone calls to SANE's helpline advertised on the serial's official website. Casting Joey was Alex O'Han's first major television role. He told an Inside Soap writer that he liked the idea of being another person and playing someone who was so different from himself. O'Han decided to maintain his education while appearing in the show, and received help from an on-set tutor. He was taken ill in late 1996 and had to have his appendix removed. While he returned to filming shortly after his operation, scripts still had to be rewritten. O'Han decided to leave the serial in early 1999 in order to concentrate solely on his education. The actor told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap, \\"I had mixed emotions on the last day. It was hard having to say goodbye to all my friends in the cast and crew.\\" O'Han made his final appearance as Joey in May 1999. Development=Characterisation Joey has a similar introduction to many other teenage characters featured in the show. He arrives in Summer Bay to escape a troubled life. He starts school at Summer Bay High and Selina Roberts (Tempany Deckert) recognises him as the son of Saul Bennett (David Ritchie). Joey had previously lived in Saul's commune. A reporter from Inside Soap said that Joey had a past \\"more dramatic than most\\". They described him as \\"clever but shy\\" and took time to settle into life in Summer Bay. Joey finds a home with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) and forms friendships with Casey Mitchell (Rebecca Croft), Stephanie Mboto (Fleur Beaupert) and Liam Tanner (Peter Scarf). He is \\"nerdy\\" and is better at winning school quizzes than female attention. O'Han described Joey as a \\"very naive and innocent\\" character. He often felt sorry for Joey because he is an outsider who is unaware of teenage issues. Joey's upbringing in the commune had led to most of his problems. O'Han explained that the character \\"is just not into the concept of having an image and worrying about what to wear and how to be cool. It's not that I am obsessed by those things but he is not even aware that they can be important issues for teenagers.\\" Joey becomes isolated after he gets tipsy at a party and embarrasses himself. He feels that he cannot face his friends, who are busy with their relationships, so he finds himself staying at home. Joey is pulled out of his isolation when his peers realise that he should be in the school quiz team. Tiegan Brook Joey's main relationship is with Tiegan Brook (Sally Marrett). As the show's official website described their relationship, it was \\"a sort of romance\\" with \\"ups and downs\\". The duo were sharing scenes since Tiegan's first day at Summer Bay High. He unsuccessfully attempted to keep her out of trouble. Joey then assumes the role of being the person who is always there to help her. Tiegan is sent away to live with another foster family, but upon her return she decides to pursue Joey. But Joey's friend Casey realises that she has feelings for Joey and this causes friction amongst the three characters. Marrett told Steven Murphy from Inside Soap that \\"Joey was the first person Tiegan wanted to see when she returned, she's pitched herself with Joey as he's always been there for her.\\" Tiegan is sceptical about how other people view her and she and Joey enjoy their time together. But Casey soon becomes jealous and attempts to keep them apart. Marrett refused to reveal whether Casey would succeed but noted that Tiegan definitely wants a relationship with Joey. The only issue is that Tiegan does not know how to behave around those she loves and keeps her feelings hidden. Murphy concluded that Tiegan and Casey would feud over Joey. Schizophrenia While Joey is in his final year at school, he develops schizophrenia. Normally balanced, Joey begins acting strangely and knows that he is not feeling right. O'Han commented that while Joey does not think anything of it, the people around him become frightened by what is happening. Irene is the most concerned about Joey and is the first to realise that he is suffering from schizophrenia. Irene tries to help Joey, but he accuses her of trying to kill him and attacks her. O'Han explained that Joey is \\"very calm\\" about it and just walks out after as if nothing has happened. To him it is not a big deal, while everyone else thinks it is terrible. As soon as O'Han learned from the writers what was going to happen to his character, he began researching the illness and consulting the relevant organisations. Joey smokes marijuana as a means to rid himself of the voices he hears. O'Han initially had reservations about the storyline. He explained \\"My main concern when I heard about (the storyline) was I wanted to do it accurately, I didn't want to insult people who have it, their families or the people who work with them and I think it's been done well according to the feedback. The storyline is also refreshing for me. It's a big challenge because it's so far from the norm in Summer Bay.\\" He added \\"It's a very valid issue to take on especially for the younger (viewers) because schizophrenia affects them the most, We will reach a younger audience that wouldn't normally be reached like if the story was done as a documentary on television. Teenagers just wouldn't listen. With Home and Away it's much more palatable for the 16 to 25-year-olds. They're most susceptible and need to be educated about it.\\" In an interview with the serial's website O'Han mentioned how the storyline was his first on-going one \\"Although it's been going on for a long time and I haven't had a storyline that's lasted that long before, sort of a gradual build-up to the actual storyline then the denouement and the continuation of dealing with the illness. It's been a really good experience, though. He admitted he was unaware of the different types of schizophrenia and varying symptoms. \\"A lot of times when people hear the word \\"schizo\\" they think it's just someone who's mad or crazy. I found that when I was actually portraying it I learnt a lot more about it.\\" When asked about playing Joey at different stages of the illness, O'Han said: \\"The script was fairly specific on exactly how erratic his behaviour was to be at a certain moment, more or less the overall thing was decided in the script, it was just up to me basically how to‚Ä¶ when it said Joey was getting upset, exactly how I'm showing that he's upset, obviously that was a decision that was made by the director and myself.\\" He described the experience as \\"unusual\\" and no other the storyline would present him with a situation where he would portray different characteristics as opposed to Joey's normal demeanour. \\"So normally he's a very sweet, nice kind of guy, fairly straight, and all of a sudden he's smoking marijuana, so it was a big turnaround.\\" O'Han conceded that Joey would be one of the least likely characters on the show to use alcohol or other drugs. He added that this was the first time the serial had featured a character with a mental illness, saying that it was not brought to his attention until after he began shooting the storyline. He thought it was \\"great\\" to act out something that had not been tackled before, calling it \\"a new experience\\" for himself and the crew. O'Han worked on the storyline with the producers and the charity SANE. He became the face of SANE's campaign and was featured on posters and pamphlets. Minister for the Department of Health and Aged Care, Dr Michael Wooldridge said that SANE used Joey for \\"deliberate mass media focus\\" and a very public health campaign. Storylines Joey arrives in Summer Bay after leaving a local commune. It is quickly revealed that he is the son of Saul, which terrifies Selina who Saul had previous kidnapped. Joey explains that he has left Saul's commune to seek life in the outside world. Selina talks to her guardian Irene and she agrees to foster Joey. Early into his stay in the Bay, Joey encounters problems; He struggles to adjust to meat and has an embarrassing episode where he runs into the Women's toilets in the Surf Club. Joey considers leaving town but Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) convinces him to stay. Joey clashes with Alex Bennett (Nick Freedman) over their differing attitudes toward Saul and soon discover they are half-brothers. They eventually put their differences aside and go camping together. Joey enrols in school and is embarrassed when his last name is revealed to be Rainbow. He befriends Liam, who is wary of him at first. Casey catches Joey's eye but she rebuffs his advances and is only interested in Liam. The three of them begin hanging out together and find themselves in mortal danger one day when a shark attacks the boat they are in. Joey makes another friend in Stephanie when she joins their group. Stephanie later dies in a fall. Tiegan arrives in Summer Bay as Pippa Ross' (Debra Lawrence) newest foster child and Joey helps her with illiteracy; They grow closer but Tiegan is transferred to another family. Irene's surrogate baby son, Paul is kidnapped by Wendy Bachelor whose husband served a prison term alongside Saul and Joey stages a plan in order to bring Paul back; He returns to the commune in attempt to fool Saul that he has returned home. The plan is almost successful until Saul figures out what Joey is up to and locks Joey, Casey and Liam in a shed and sets fire to the commune while holding Selina hostage. Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin) assists with the rescue and everyone manages to escape but Saul is presumed to have burned to death; leaving Joey devastated. Paul is later found and later given to Irene's daughter Finlay (Tina Thomsen). Saul is later discovered to be alive and kidnaps Selina and is later killed when Constable Terri Garner (Alyson Standen) shoots him. Casey begins to take an interest in Joey but he is only interested in Tiegan who has returned. There is constant friction in the relationship and Tiegan later joins Monkey Jam, a Rock Band with Aaron Welles (Ritchie Gudgeon) and she dumps Joey for the lead singer, Colt (Brendan Cowell). Around the time of the HSC, Joey's behaviour becomes strange and erratic and he has an outburst during an exam. Tiegan returns and tries to support him but he turns on her. Joey is persistently rude toward Will (Zac Drayson) and Hayley Smith (Bec Cartwright) and begins staying out all night and disappears for several days. He returns with Kaia Stokes (Blazey Best), a girl he met in the city. Joey's habits worsen as he gives Irene and Kaia a fright by standing on a cliff top claiming he is invincible. Aaron returns and he and Joey go on a camping trip where Joey freaks out after smoking marijuana. Joey's behaviour reaches a climax when he sees a vision of Saul, who had died two years earlier, on his computer screen who tells him that Irene is against them. Joey then tries to smother a sleeping Irene with a pillow but is stopped by Chloe Richards (Kristy Wright) and James Fraser (Michael Picilliri). Joey then voluntarily admits himself to a mental hospital and is treated for schizophrenia. Following his recovery and release from hospital, Joey falls for Miranda Porter (Lauren Hewett). When Miranda panics after cutting herself while grating cheese during a meal, Joey is curious. Miranda tells him she is HIV positive and wants it kept secret they remain friends. Joey discovers he is eligible to attend University but decides to defer for a year travel around Australia giving talks on mental illness. Irene and his friends do not want him to leave but Joey's mind is made up and he bids Summer Bay farewell. Reception Joey's schizophrenia storyline was positively received by critics and helped SANE Australia heighten awareness of mental illness. SANE, who had an input in the storyline, received a 100% increase in calls due to their telephone number being advertised on the Home and Away website. A writer for Inside Soap commended Home and Away for Joey's schizophrenia storyline, noting that the character's gradual breakdown had been \\"well-observed and sensitively handled.\\" The writer continued \\"The show could easily have picked a more volatile character, but instead chose the intelligent, seemingly well-balanced Joey. They have remembered that schizophrenia is something that can happen to anyone.\\" Channel 5 chose the episode in which Joey tries to save Saul following the commune fire as one of their favourite ever Home and Away episodes. A reporter from Soap Stars said that \\"pint sized Joey\\" transformed into a \\"babe magnet\\".

Edited by Walter H. Conser, Jr., Ronald M. McCarthy, David J. Toscano and Gene Sharp, the book was published in the United States in 1986. It argues that the Stamp Act resistance and other campaigns from 1765 to 1775 were fundamental for shaping the outcome of the struggle for American independence, and were not merely a \\"prelude\\" to armed conflict. Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of these campaigns, but key features of this nonviolence have been largely neglected by historians. To fill this perceived gap, the book provides a sustained narrative of the 1765‚Äì1775 resistance, followed by a set of interpretive essays aimed to provoke further discussion and inquiry. Six hypothetical explanations are offered for why the colonists shifted to military struggle, despite the considerable success of nonviolent struggle. Reviews have appeared in several historical and legal journals. Origins Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765‚Äì1775 (RPASI), claims that most historians of colonial America have treated the events of 1765‚Äì1775 as merely a \\"prelude\\" (edited book) to the US Revolutionary War. Events such as the resistance to the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts are typically treated as \\"not significant in themselves.\\" This book, however In their preface, the editors state that their interest in the historical period covered in RPASI began in the 1970s, when they were studying nonviolent action as a pragmatic tool of civilian struggle. In their work, they \\"I beseech you... to avoid Blood and Tumult.... Nothing can ruin us but our Violence.\\" --Samuel Adams, 1774.Quoted on page v of RPASI. In a letter from Samuel Adams to James Warren, 21 May 1774. Indeed, \\"researchers often look throughout the length of a period for evidence of what they regard as its inevitable outcome... for example... for the roots of war.... In the process, they... may ignore the contributions of alternative means to the outcome.\\" An example is that \\"Samuel Adams, whom many... associate with the tactics of violence, issued numerous statements prior to Lexington and Concord opposing the use of armed force\\" (see quote at left). The book project was originally conceived due to recognition by co-editor Gene Sharp, a leading scholar of nonviolent struggle, that the American colonists had \\"employed the techniques of nonviolent resistance\\" in their struggle against Great Britain. > The preface states that Sharp \\"has been unfailingly helpful in the other > editors' attempt to understand the significance of these actions and has > been centrally responsible for placing this work within the context of > contemporary Anglo-American scholarship. Editors Conser, McCarthy, and > Toscano wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge their great debt to > Gene Sharp and his efforts to make the work as complete and rigorous as > possibleRPASI, p. xi. The book was sponsored by Harvard University's Center for International Affairs, and by the Albert Einstein Institution,\\"A book from the Program on Nonviolent Sanctions in Conflict and Defense, Center for International Affairs, Harvard University and the Albert Einstein Institution\\" (RPASI, p. ii). both led by Sharp. The editors claim that the book \\"if read carefully, is likely to spark scholarly controversy and argument,\\" and that they \\"believe that such debate can clarify the issues... and enhance the understanding of this critical decade in our history.\\" Topics covered { width=50%; style=\\"float: right; border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: .46em; font-size: 80%;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" -valign=\\"top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"left\\" style=\\"background:gold;\\"John Adams (US President, 1797‚Äì1801) \\"A history of military operations from April 19, 1775 to the 3d of September, 1783, is not a history of the American Revolution....

After the first introductory chapter, the next 7 chapters contain the book's \\"narrative section,\\" which focuses on describing the struggles from 1765 to 1775 chronologically, using the \\"terminology of the day,\\" and only \\"rarely [making] use of the term 'nonviolent action.'\\" The book's final 6 chapters are analytical, offering interpretations of the decade's events. These chapters address questions raised in the narrative section, and also suggest areas for future research. Basic concepts are introduced in Chapter 1, which gives an overview of the three main resistance campaigns of 1765 to 1775 opposing the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townsend Acts of 1767, and the Coercive Acts of 1774. Nonviolent action is described as a technique that operates to bring about change through serving to \\"manipulate the shared social, cultural, economic and political system in which the opposing parties engage in conflict.\\" Citing Sharp's Politics of Nonviolent Action, they divide methods of nonviolent action into the three categories of nonviolent protest and persuasion, noncooperation, and nonviolent intervention. Nonviolent action succeeds by \\"rendering the opponent's sources of power unusable, unworkable, and uncontrollable,\\" through mechanisms that may include conversion, accommodation, or \\"nonviolent coercion [that] occurs when an opponent is forced against his or her will to grant the actionists' demands.\\" The editors argue (Ch. 1) that previous scholarship has overlooked \\"the degree to which the colonists used a kind of 'weapons system' that operated without force of arms or violence in trying to compel the British government to change its policies.\\" Viewed from this angle, commercial resistance (nonimportation) is analyzed closely (Ch. 9). It is apparent that the colonists' skill in applying the methods of nonviolent struggle \\"improved greatly over the decade,\\" as did the \\"intellectual underpinnings\\" of their resistance (Chs. 10, 11). Still, at the close of the decade, the nonviolent movement was abandoned in favor of military resistance, and the editors discuss six alternative hypothetical explanations for why this shift occurred (Ch. 12; see table at right). The hypothetical explanations are not meant as mutually exclusive, but as \\"avenues for fruitful inquiry.\\" Indeed, John Adams (quoted above right), who lived through and helped lead the independence struggle, claimed that \\"The revolution was... substantially effected before hostilities commenced.\\" McCarthy (Ch. 14) argues that \\"independence in many of the colonies had essentially been achieved prior to the commencement of military hostilities at Lexington and Concord.\\" { width=35%; style=\\"float: right; border: 1px solid darkgray; margin: .46em; font-size: 80%;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" -valign=\\"top\\"  colspan=\\"3\\" align=\\"center\\" Appendices: Historical Documents -valign=\\"top\\" A.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Examination of Benjamin Franklin on the Stamp Act, 12-‚Äì13 February 1766 -valign=\\"top\\" B.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Letter Three of John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania -valign=\\"top\\" C.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Excerpt from the Boston Newsletter, 6 July 1769 -valign=\\"top\\" D.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Virginia Association, August 1774 -valign=\\"top\\" E.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Suffolk Resolves, 14 September 1774 -valign=\\"top\\" F.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Continental Association, October 1774 -valign=\\"top\\" G.  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"left\\" Letters and Diary Extracts of Josiah Quincy, Jr., 1774‚Äì1775 } The book concludes with 7 appendices that reproduce key historical materials (see table below right), as well as a 23-page index. Reviews and influence Reviews have appeared in the Journal of Southern History the Journal of American History, ISSN 1936-0967 and the Law and History Review. In the Journal of Southern History, Mills wrote of RPASI that \\"Although the work covers familiar ground, the approach is fresh and the treatment is stimulating. The interpretative theme is certain to provoke debate.\\" He added that \\"The criticisms one might make of this study are cosmetic (e.g., the considerable variations in the sizes of several chapters) rather than substantive.\\" In the Journal of American History, Ireland commended the historical essays as shedding light on important aspects of the American Revolution, stating that \\"having them collected together in one place is useful.\\" He was critical of most chapters by the editors as \\"much less valuable,\\" and came away feeling \\"that I have missed the point, or that there is no point here of any great moment for a historian.\\" In Law and History Review, Roeber wrote that RPASI \\"includes stimulating essays by ten authors, four British,\\" and But in the American colonial frontier, \\"military tactics were acknowledged by all to be more vicious than those employed in European conflicts.\\" Thus, for Roeber, \\"One comes away from this rich and stimulating series of essays with the disturbing sense that Americans had, at the very time of the Republic's founding, been swept up on a tide of violent resistance that fit with their colonial frontier experience.\\" Mills wrote that \\"One can hope that the challenge to conduct more research into the period from 1774 to 1775 and the shift from nonviolent to violent action will be heeded.\\" See also *Nonviolent revolution References 1986 non-fiction books Nonviolence Works by Gene Sharp History books about the American Revolution ","title":"Resistance, Politics, and the American Struggle for Independence, 1765‚Äì1775"},{"id":"36021101","text":"Macroplea pubipennis is a species of leaf beetle of the subfamily Donaciinae that is endemic to Finland.

It is part of the World Heritage Gondwana Rainforests of Australia. The lower sections of the mountain are made up of sedimentary rocks such as mudstones. A residual basalt cap appears at above sea level. It originated from the flow of the nearby Barrington Volcano. The mountain is partially in Mount Royal National Park and Barrington Tops National Park.  History  Mount Royal was first discovered and summited by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1843.

Their place the upper canopy is taken by the golden sassafras. The elevated narrow rainforest features hanging moss, often covered in mist. The mountain's summit is covered in a low rainforest thicket, composed mostly of the hill water gum. Other noteworthy plants on the mountain include New England blackbutt, chainfruit, prickly ash, grass tree and the mountain walnut. Another interesting feature of Mount Royal is the grassy balds, surrounded by temperate rainforest. Fire caused by lightning is one speculative theory of their origin. The lower south east slopes of Mount Royal support a well developed sub-tropical rainforest. Significant species include the Australian red cedar, citronella, rosewood and the giant stinging tree.  Fauna  A considerable variety of birds and animals are found in the area. Wedge-tailed eagles, eastern grey kangaroos and tiger snakes are common. Some of the more rare inhabitants include: the rufous scrub-bird, paradise riflebird, wompoo fruit dove, Parma wallaby, rough-scaled snake, stuttering frog, Booroolong frog and the Davies' tree frog.

During the 1970s, Rinaldo and his associates formed and operated a non-profit corporation, Ellogos, and several profit-making businesses based in Snohomish, Washington, including Eden Farms, Cascadian Publishing, Golden Gallery, and Ted Anthony & Associates, among others. In 1979, Rinaldo was arrested on seven charges, including felony counts of statutory rape, indecent liberties, and intimidating a witness. Later that year, he was convicted of third-degree statutory rape for having sexual intercourse with one minor girl and of taking indecent liberties with another. Early life and education Rinaldo was born in 1944 in Oneida, New York into a Catholic family. He attended Oneida High School (class of 1963), but being a borderline juvenile delinquent, never earned a high school diploma. After some friends were killed in an automobile accident, he resolved to study to become a priest. However, he also explored a number of other churches, and ended up becoming the \\"black sheep in a Catholic family.\\" He attended a Bible college in New York state, but dropped out after about a year. After leaving Oneida, he worked at a variety of odd jobs, never spending more than a year in one place. In an interview with the Everett Herald, Rinaldo said that he had been an ordained minister \\"for a brief time\\", but later declined to identify the church which had ordained him. Rinaldo eventually ended up in Tucson, Arizona, where he spoke at a religious meeting attended by Paul Goff. Goff invited Rinaldo and his family to live in his Tucson guest house, where they resided for three months. Move to Seattle In 1969, Rinaldo moved to Seattle, Washington, accompanied by Goff. Together, they started having nightly meetings in a Seattle area home. Rinaldo also started a leather importing business. Eventually, Goff moved back to Tucson, while Rinaldo remained in Seattle. \\"The Group\\" Rinaldo had been invited to the Seattle area by people who had heard him preach elsewhere. He arrived with a couple of suitcases and little in the way of funds. He attracted a broad range of followers, ranging from young people disillusioned with the 1960s counterculture to senior citizens. Rinaldo began holding religious meetings in a Bellevue home. Followers reported that he told them they were a group of special people who were actually sons of God. With his guidance, they were to lead the world to a better life, attracting other people through the simple goodness of their nature. They referred to their association simply as \\"The Group\\". In the early 1970s, Rinaldo began to bring up the subject of buying property at the meetings. His followers began to donate money. One estimated that over the years, he contributed $30,000. A couple reported that they had made a $20,000 donation to Rinaldo, believing they were donating to a religious organization. A woman estimated that over 5.5 years she had contributed around $10,000, despite the fact that she had a low income and was in fact unemployed for 20 months during that period. Business activities=Ellogos In 1971, Rinaldo formed a non-profit corporation called Ellogos with three associates, Howard Morse, Gerald Schindler, and Craig Reynolds. Together, they sought a location where the business climate seemed right for their future plans, eventually deciding on Snohomish, Washington. In 1973, Ellogos started buying land there, accumulating 60 to 80 acres of adjacent property. Ellogos was granted tax-exempt status by the US Internal Revenue Service in 1971, listing in its application five purposes for which it was organized: religious, educational, charitable, scientific, and literary. Between 1971 and 1976, Ellogos tax returns listed over $229,000 in contributions, gifts, and grants. The word Ellogos combined the Hebrew word El meaning 'God', and the Greek word logos meaning 'word': thus, 'Word of God'. Eden Farms In 1974, townspeople began to observe unusual activity on the Snohomish property. Twenty-five or thirty tents were erected in a pasture that summer. Group meetings were seen taking place on the lawns. Workers, sometimes as many as 50, were seen in the fields hoeing and picking up rocks. A sign was erected designating the enterprise as \\"Eden Farms\\". Vegetables were grown and sold at a produce stand near the road. Followers were instructed not to mention the religious aspect of the organization to outsiders. Expansion and community activities Over the next few years, improvements and construction took place. By 1978, there were stables and a new horse arena. A fence was erected around Rinaldo's residence, and two German Shepherds were seen on guard inside the fence. Rinaldo also became involved in business and community activities in Snohomish. He joined the local Masonic Lodge. He and his partners purchased a building which came to house the Snohomish Chamber of Commerce, and Rinaldo became a member of its board of directors. From 1974 through 1978, Ellogos ran a Bingo game in the basement of the American Legion hall. In 1978, Rinaldo was campaign manager for the Republican candidate for Snohomish County Sheriff. Other businesses were established, the most notable being Cascadian Publishing, which published three weekly newspapers: the Monroe Chronicle, the Lake Stevens Lookout, and the Duvall Cascadian. In addition, an art gallery (Golden Gallery), a florist (The Green House), and a carpet store (A-1 Carpet and Floor Covering) were owned or controlled by Rinaldo and his associates. Ellogos also operated the state-licensed Snohomish Preschool and Daycare. In August 1978, Ellogos purchased a recreational property on the Stillaguamish River, sporting a three-story A-frame house with at least seven bedrooms, a bar, and a heated indoor swimming pool. The dark side of Eden Sometime during the spring of 1979, Eden Farms became the subject of two independent investigations, one conducted by the Snohomish County Sheriff's Department, the other led by investigative reporter Gary Larson of the Everett Herald. During the course of his investigation, Larson interviewed 14 former members of Rinaldo's organizations, only one of whom would allow his name to be used in the paper. As a result of these interviews, Larson reported the following facts: *Ten people reported that Rinaldo was the leader of a secretive religious organization called simply \\"The Group\\". *Eight people reported that Rinaldo had led loyalty ceremonies, similar to a communion service, in which members pledged loyalty to him. *Five youths reported that they had lived and worked at Eden farm for little or no pay, were strictly controlled and had little freedom. *Four people reported that Rinaldo had threatened that anyone leaving the group would experience illness or financial hardship. *Three youths reported having been physically assaulted by Rinaldo for breaking rules or angering their superiors. *Three women reported that Rinaldo had claimed to be Michael the Archangel, leader of the angels in the Book of Revelation. *Three people reported that they had recently left the group after hearing stories about Rinaldo's possible sexual involvement with girls in the group. *Two people reported that Rinaldo had told them he was compiling potentially damaging information about various members of the group. *Two people reported that Rinaldo had prophesied world catastrophes and was planning to move \\"The Group\\" to Arkansas, where they would become \\"an important political force\\". Arrest, trial, and conviction On July 12, 1979, Rinaldo was arrested by Snohomish County sheriff's deputies on seven charges, including felony counts of statutory rape, indecent liberties, and intimidating a witness. Immediately following his arrest, his business and religious activities were the subject of a six article series by investigative reporter Gary Larson of the Everett Herald, running from July 13 through July 19. During his trial, prosecutors alleged that Ellogos was a secret religious organization dominated by Rinaldo by means of fear and isolation. During the first four days of testimony, five women testified that Rinaldo had touched them indecently or had sexual intercourse with them when they were young teenagers. Rinaldo's wife, Anne Sundberg Rinaldo, testified in his defense that she never saw or heard anything to suggest that he was engaging in any form of sexual misconduct. Rinaldo also testified in his own defense. Several defense witnesses, all members of Ellogos, testified that based on the opinions of six Snohomish businessmen, three of Rinaldo's accusers had \\"bad\\" reputations for telling the truth. However, the State called the businessmen as witnesses, and each of them testified that they had never formed or expressed opinions on the truthfulness of the prosecution witnesses. On December 3, 1979, Rinaldo was convicted of third-degree statutory rape for having sexual intercourse with one minor girl and of taking indecent liberties with another. The State petitioned for a determination of sexual psychopathy, and Rinaldo was committed for a 90-day observation period to Western State Hospital. After the completion of the observation period, the trial court determined that Rinaldo was indeed a sexual psychopath and committed him for treatment at the same facility. Several months later, the Superintendent of Western State Hospital notified the court that while he agreed with the determination, the patient was not amenable to treatment, and the trial court ordered the execution of the original prison sentence. Appeals The conviction was the subject of several notable appeals. In March 1983, The Everett Herald lost an appellate court case in the State of Washington in which it sought to quash a subpoena allowing a judicial review of confidential material gathered for articles it had published in 1979 on the cult activities of Rinaldo, who had since been convicted on charges of rape, indecent liberties and assault. The New York Times reported that the court had ruled that \\"criminal defendants could force reporters to reveal confidential sources if the information was crucial to the case\\" and characterized the loss as \\"a major defeat for the news media\\". The Herald took the Appeals Court decision to the Washington Supreme Court in State v. Rinaldo 102 Wn.2d 749 (1984), which was heard en banc with the result that the subpoena itself was quashed on the basis that Rinaldo had not met the threshold requirements to compel such an inspection, while upholding the Court of Appeals ruling in general. Death Rinaldo died on February 13, 2000 in Springdale, Arkansas. He was buried in St. Patrick's cemetery in Oneida, New York.

The building is also variously known as the Place of Kilbirnie, The Place, or Kilbirnie House. The site lies close to a stream and small but deep ravine that once provided a defensive function for the castle site. The castle and manor house themselves are not in the grounds of the Kilbirnie Place Golf Club, which was itself laid out in 1925 on the old landscaped 'pleasure grounds' once attached to the castle site.Kilbirnie Place Golf Club Retrieved : 2012-05-31 The OS maps show that a much later estate and house called Place was located nearby, built by the Knox family but now mostly demolished. History One of three \\"Lairds Lofts\\" at Kilbirnie parish church The name \\"Kilbirnie\\" is derived from the Gaelic language, and means \\"Church of St Brendan\\".Mills The parish was divided into three baronies: Kilbirnie, Ladyland, and Glengarnock. The feudal Barony of Kilbirnie was the largest in the parish at around 5500 acres and had the most fertile quarter with 3000 acres of arable, pasture and woodland.Paterson, Page 282 Kilbirnie Castle is said to be the site where in 1263 the Scots mustered under Alexander III before fighting Norwegian forces in the Battle of Largs.Knight, Pages 83‚Äì84 The castle's location is on high ground above the bend of a deep ravine, giving the site some protection along its west and north sides although it is set back from the edge of this ravine. The word place in Scots refers to a landed proprietor's mansion house,Warrack and is equivalent in meaning to the English word \\"palace\\",Campbell, Page 198 although the term \\"palace\\" acquired its present connotations at a much later date.McKean, Page 53 The dwelling is clearly seen as being in two quite distinct parts: one a substantial defensive tower built in about 1470 for Malcolm Crawfurd and his wife, Marjory Barclay, an heiress and the last of her line; the other part is dated to 1627 and is a more comfortable dwelling with no significant defensive features. The entrance to the new 'wing' has a very unusual and prominent projecting porch on the south front.Campbell, Page 199 Gothic script set into the 'Grand Hall' fireplace. Timothy Pont's map, c. 1604, as published by Joan Blaeu in Amsterdam (1654) , shows Kilbirnan Castle (sic), as this date precedes the building of the mansion house wing.Pont's map Retrieved : 2012-06-02 John Adair's map of c. 1685 shows a castellated structure recorded as Kilburny.Adair's map Retrieved : 2012-06-02 Roy's map of 1747 shows the castle and the landscaped avenue feature.

Survey date: 1856. Publication date: 1858. The Honourable Patrick Lindsay purchased the castle and estate of Glengarnock in 1677 from Richard Cuninghame, the last of the Cuninghames of the Barony of Glengarnock. In 1707 both baronies were united in the Barony of Kilburnie, with the Manor House of Kilbirnie as the principal messuage.Dobie, Page 231 Keep This very impressive 15th-century structure measures 42 feet by 33 feet, with walls between 7 feet and 8 feet in thickness. A cellar was present and a sleeping loft under a vault. Another vault had a hall, lit by three windows in the south wall and a window high up in the north wall, a private room lay beneath. The tower was four storeys high and in the north-west corner a \\"starving pit\\" prison was entered by a hatch from a passage from the stair at loft level.Salter, Page 46 Gun ports are not present. The entrance to the 'Starving Pit' in the castle keep. In 1602 the Place of Kilbirnie was broken into whilst the laird \\"was furth of this realme\\" and his wife Margaret was at Greenock. A John Crawfurd of \\"Auchinbothe\\" was arrested and tried, however he was found innocent despite having returned some of the stolen items to Lady Kilbirnie. The charter chest was one of the items broken into and items removed from.Paterson, Page 294 At the north-eastern side of the keep are ruins that represent the site of an oven and other building remnants that probably represent the site of the kitchens.Mcgibbon, Page 393 ;Divine protection Set within the main fireplace of the keep are two red sandstone carved pieces with Gothic script. One reads 'Maria' and the other with smaller script has not been deciphered. Sandstone pillars on either side of this fireplace carry carvings of climbing plants that may be ivy. One suggestion regarding the Gothic script carvings in the fireplace is that they could be the names of saints and that this was a religious 'Apotropaic' protective device to prevent the ingress of evil spirits into the house through an otherwise 'unprotected' entry point. The Puritans acted against images of the Virgin Mary however a widespread use of her name or more usually initials continued.Apotropaic Symbols on Cast Iron Firebacks The Gothic script and positioning on the stone suggests that a secondary use from a tomb and this would be seen as doubly potent if it was once housed within the nearby Kilwinning Abbey as it would be seen to have been infused with holy energies. The old main entrance to the keep was at the east angle of the north side and later entered into a courtyard. The ground level is now considerably raised up and only the arch of the door can be seen. Mansion This wing was constructed in 1627 at right angles to the old keep using rubble faced with dressed with sandstone ashlar.British Listed Buildings. Retrieved : 2012-06-02 A door was broken through from the hall of the old keep to a staircase in the mansion house. The mansion was a fine specimen of 17th-century architecture.MacGibbon, Page 391 It had turrets corbelled out at hall level and these contained closets. The front door was set in an unusual shallow projection and a narrow back door at the north facing aspect led into a courtyard. Two cellars existed with a passage between them that connected with the main staircase. The hall in the old tower may have been used as a dining area and the large room in the mansion house utilised as a drawing-room. The most southerly turret and a large part of mansion house wing fell at some point between 1956 and 1964.RCAHMS Record for Kilbirnie Place =Fire= Lady Jean Lindsay as Countess of Eglinton. The buildings were destroyed by fire early in the morning of 1 May 1757 during construction works, and never rebuilt. A servant who was going to the stables saw that smoke was rising from the roof and gave the alarm.MacGibbon, Page 395 The 19th Earl of Crawfurd, his infant daughter Jean (later a Countess of Eglinton) and domestics had little time to escape the ferocity of the flames.Paterson,Page 286-287 The family moved to the Kilbirnie Barony manse at first and later settled at Bourtreehill House near Irvine. Lady Crawfurd was the eldest daughter and heiress of Robert Hamilton of Bourtreehill.Dobie, Page 233 The remains of the 'Grand Avenue'. Regarding the cause of the fire, the story goes that before going to bed, a lady of the house threw melted grease from the socket of a large candlestick into a fire grate in a lower storey of the house and the ensuing flames set alight the unswept chimney flue, the fire rapidly entering the new mansion wing through windows in the garret that had been left open by workmen. The keys had been taken offsite by carpenters and access to control the fire was impossible. Large numbers of people turned out to help, but their assistance was to no avail. Until the death of the earl in 1781 the cause had been carefully concealed and supernatural forces held to blame.Paterson, Pages 287‚Äì288 Some of the buildings were retained for a time as a hunting lodge.Kilbirnie Kirk Retrieved : 2012-12-10 Pleasure gardens The approach to the building from the south was a long straight avenue twenty yards wide, bordered by high walls and once enclosing large gardens.MacGibbon, Page 390 The section down to Causewayfoot was bordered by walls and the section down to the termination at Fudstone (now demolished) was tree-lined only. The remnants of the 'Grand Avenue' are still discernable.Close, Page 94 A substantial walled garden in two portions ran down from the castle to the ravine or glen, long abandoned, and shown on the OS maps with a set of steps between the tow portions and a small building attached to the wall on the northern side. Paterson records that the extensive pleasure-grounds were \\"torn up by the plough\\".Paterson, Page 287 The gardens once contained flowers and shrubs, potatoes, turnips, and orchards. As late as 1856 the walled garden is shown as containing what may have been apple trees of which one survives (2015). Estate Ruins of the walled garden. The mains farm is recorded as Place Farm and sometimes, confusingly, as Kilbirnie Place. The old castle site is recorded as Kilbirnie House. A lane ran up to the Largs Road from Causewayfoot, via a dwelling at Parkfoot, now demolished, crossing the Paduff Burn rivulet by a ford. Birinie's well was a spring that supplied excellent water. It was about a quarter of a mile north of the Kilbirnie Castle ruins and water was carried to the castle by pipes. The well was named after St Brendan (Sanctus Birinius), a 6th century saint associated with Kilbirnie Church. The well has been 'capped' and its site sits at the end of an old path.Paterson, Page 281 Ordnance Survey (OS) maps show that a sandstone quarry was located at Causewayfoot, overlooked by the old but now demolished dwelling at Selsy, with cottages and the farm of Causewayfoot standing nearby. A small ironstone pit was also present. The OS 6 in. of 1897, 1911, 1938 show a trapezoidal curling pond south-west of Kilbirnie Castle and records show that a match was played between Kilbirnie v. Dalry 3 rinks each, on 20 February 1895.Scottish Curling Places Retrieved : 2012-06-02 The curling pond built below the Causewayfoot is now drained and overgrown, shown as already abandoned in 1938. A lozenge-shaped curling pond at Fudstone south-west of the dwelling is shown on OS 6 in. 1st ed. ca. 1860, 1897 and 1911. Auld Kirk of Kilbirnie The arms of the Barclays, impaled with those of Crawfurd are carved on a panel located on the tower of the kirk.Bryden, Page 12 The Crawfurds added the Crawfurd Aisle to the Auld Kirk with its fine Renaissance-style carvings of 1642.Coventry, Page 129 A private apartment is located behind with the family burial vaults lying beneath. The numerous heraldic shields were carved for John, first Viscount Garnock, and represent the armorial bearings of his ancestors. Associated families=Barclays The castle passed from the Barclays to the Crawfurds through the marriage of Marjory, an heiress, to Malcolm Crawfurd. Marjory was the daughter of Sir John Barclay of Kilbirnie and Craufurd-John.Paterson, Page 293 These Barclays of Kilbirnie are thought to have been a branch of the ancient family of the Barclays of Ardrossan. Sir Walter Barclay was Lord High Chamberlain of Scotland in 1174 and married Margaret Crawfurd of Craufurd- John. Marjory was descended from this line. Crawfurds The main entrance to the 16th Century wing. In 1470 Thomas Crawfurd, sometimes written as Crauford or Crawford, obtained the castle through marriage. He was descended from the Crawfurds of Loudoun Castle.Dobie, Page 230 Sir John Crawfurd had been knighted by Charles I in 1642 and fought in the Civil Wars, but died without any heirs in 1661. John Crawfurd married Margaret, daughter of John Blair of that Ilk,Paterson, Page 294 although Dobie records her as being the daughter of James, Earl of Glencairn.Dobie, Page 232 Cornelius Crawfurd of Jordanhill was the closest relative, however his youngest daughter Maragaret Crawfurd inherited the estate of Kilbirnie. In 1810 John Crawfurd assumed the name Lindsay and claimed to be descended from the Hon. James Crawfurd, third son of the first Viscount Garnock. After much expense and deliberation the story was found to be entirely false and the claim rejected. To add some credibility to the claim he had claimed that his forebear had been the eldest son and heir and had been forced to flee to Ireland after having murdered a man in a duel by firing before the signal. This duel he claimed had been over a matter of honour relating to the Lady Susanna Kennedy, later Countess of Eglinton, with whom he was entirely smitten.Lauchland, Page 73 The Crawfurd- Pollocks of Pollok and Kilbirnie were granted a baronetcy that was extinct by 1885.Love (2003), Page 77 Lindsay Crawfurds The courtyard area and site of the old kitchen block. Margaret Crawfurd had been married to Patrick, second son of John, 15th Earl of Crawfurd and 1st of Lindsay. Her husband took the title and armorial bearings of Crawfurd of Kilburnie as per the entail to the estate.Dobie, Page 230 The couple died only three days apart in 1680 from a malignant fever that also carried off her sister, Lady Blackhall, when she came down for the funeral. Records show that a significant number of mourners travelled down from Glasgow to the funeral.Paterson, Page 295 The eldest son of their seven children, John, inherited in 1690. John Crawfurd became the commander of the Fencible men of Cuninghame in 1689 and in 1693 he was chosen as the Ayrshire member of the Scots Parliament. In 1705 he was created Viscount Mount Crawfurd (later changed to Viscount Garnock) by Queen Anne, and died in December 1708. He married Margaret Stewart, daughter of the first Earl of Bute, and the couple had two sons and three daughters. The line continued until George Lindsay Crawfurd inherited, the 20th Earl of Crawfurd, 6th Earl of Lindsay, and 4th Viscount Garnock, who died unmarried in 1808 and the estates passed to his sister, Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd who also died unmarried in 1833.Paterson, Page 296 Boyles In 1833 George Boyle, 4th Earl of Glasgow, inherited the ruins of the fire-gutted castle and house from Lady Mary Lindsay Crawfurd. George was descended from Margaret, eldest daughter of Maragret Crawfurd and Patrick Lindsay, who had married David, 1st Earl of Glasgow. Knoxs At the break up of the Earl of Glasgow's estates the castle and lands were purchased by Sir James Knox.Kinninburgh, Page 108 Place House Kilbirnie Place, or Place House, was built between 1892 and 1894 for Sir James Knox. The house was designed by Henry Lord of Manchester.

The action lasted from 1971 to 1981, and ended in victory for the resistance movement when the newly elected President Fran√ßois Mitterrand formally abandoned the project. The base, used for training French soldiers, was originally established in 1902 on of uncultivated heathland. Michel Debr√©, Minister of Defence in the Georges Pompidou administration, announced that the base would be extended to and that the necessary land would be expropriated in the public interest. An initial informal resistance movement was formed by 103 landowners whose land was subject to expropriation. In 1973 their cause was taken up by a much larger group of heterogeneous activists, predominantly left wing, and numbering up to 100,000. This activist group descended on the Larzac in support of the peasant landowners and extended the protest to a more general action against what they saw as the militarism of the Pompidou government. This action, once it had achieved its focal aims on the Larzac, was the core of what then became the Anti-Globalism movement, and also served to bring to public attention leaders such as Lanza del Vasto, Jos√© Bov√©, and the late Guy Tarlier.  Origins of the conflict = Announcement of intention  On 11 October 1970, during a session of the Union des d√©mocrates pour la r√©publique (UDR) (Union of democrats for the Republic), Andr√© Fanton, secretary of state for defence, gave the first hint that the base would need to be extended. Le Monde of 6 March 1971 quoted Deputy Delmas, then campaigning for election to UDR, as saying \\"The extension of the military base is doubtless the last chance for survival of the town of Millau.\\" Millau (,) at the Northern edge of the Larzac plateau, is today world-famous for its spectacular viaduct over the river Tarn. In 1971 it was chiefly known to French families for its sheepskin glove industry in decline and its infuriating traffic jams. Popular resistance to the proposal for the military base was immediately evident . On 28 October 1971, Defence Minister Michel Debr√© made the formal announcement in a televised interview. The base was to be extended from 3,000 to 17,000 hectares (30 to 170 square kilometers). Land would be expropriated from 107 farms in 12 communes centred on the small town of La Cavalerie. The extended base would form one sixth of the total area (100,000 hectares) of the Larzac itself. In subsequent commentary, Debr√© pointed out that the project would be \\"not only vital to the national defence\\", but would have \\"a positive impact\\" on the region. He cited improvement of the rural electrical distribution system, water supply, and roadways . He stated that the extension was necessitated by saturation of French military bases in general, and the need to maintain a military force in proximity to the Plateau d'Albion, launch site of ground-ground ballistic nuclear missiles which formed an important element of the French nuclear deterrent . It was argued by the authorities that the Larzac plateau was very thinly populated, having been substantially depopulated by the so-called \\"rural exodus\\", losing two thirds of its population between 1866 and 1968, although since 1968 population had begun to increase due to the \\"neo-rural\\" movement. Sheep herders and producers of Roquefort cheese, the most famous product of the region, denied that the project would be a net boost for employment because, as a training camp, it would attract only temporary inhabitants. They were also sceptical of the promised economic benefits.TV report, 28 November 1971 Andr√© Fanton made his attitude clear in a public speech:  First demonstrations, oath of the 103  Left to right, Jean- Marie Muller, Lanza del Vasto, Jacques de Bollardi√®re on the Larzac during the struggle against the military camp extension. The first notable demonstration took place on 6 November 1971 at Millau. Some 6,000 people assembled in the Place du Mandarous. At this point the movement was still local, but it attracted a fairly wide spectrum of participants. The core group were members of long-established and deeply rooted peasant families, but there were also many younger farming families, new to the area and heavily in debt to the Cr√©dit Agricole bank which had financed their acquisition and exploitation of land.\\"Christian Rouaud: The fight for the Larzac changed people's lives\\" (evene.fr) Many of these relative newcomers belonged to the quasi-religious organisation Jeunesse Agricole Catholique (Young Catholic Farmers.) Institutional religion was influential in reconciling the many divergent views at this point. Notably, on 7 November 1971 the bishop of Rodez (the Departmental seat of government) announced his opposition to the base extension. There was sufficient unanimity, at any rate, for 103 of the 107 people potentially threatened with expropriation to sign a formal contract on 28 March 1972. The contract expressed solidarity and declared that not a single farmer would be dispossessed against his will. This was the \\"Oath of the 103.\\" A further demonstration took place the following 14 July, the national holiday, in Rodez. 20,000 people and 70 tractors participated. The slogan GARDAREM LO LARZAC began to appear all across the region. It means, loosely, THE LARZAC IS OURS, and significantly it's written in Occitan, the ancient language of Languedoc which is not used commercially but is cherished by a militant minority.  Politicisation = Mass rallies  Suddenly, the defiant peasant resistance to militarism became a flagrant political cause c√©l√®bre. Left-wingers of all types took up the cause. Socialists, Communists, and Trade Union militants appeared in Millau and in the villages of the Larzac noisily adding their support to a movement that had originally been declared apolitical. To these were added Occitanian Nationalists, protesting what they saw as cultural genocide by a colonial power. Further complicating the situation, a rag-tag assortment of hippies and drop-outs attached themselves to the resistance movement, together with protesters whose motives seemed very remote from the interests of sheep husbandry - pro-choice feminists, for example.Michelle Zancarini-Fournel, Histoire(s) du MLAC (1973‚Äì1975), Revue Clio, n¬∞ 18, 2003, pp. 241-252 pr√©sentation en ligne Writing in Le Monde (25 August 1973), Michel Castaing described the Larzac as \\"The shop window of protest\\". This phase of the protest movement culminated in the first mass rally, on 25/26 August 1973, at Rajal del Guorp (the name means 'Crow Springs' in occitan,) a natural dolomitic amphitheatre northwest of La Cavalerie. The location is inside the perimeter of the existing military base, and so holding the rally there was an act of defiance in itself. Between 60,000 and 100,000 people (the latter figure claimed by the organisers) assembled to show their support, in a remote site entirely devoid of facilities for refreshment and hygiene. The event attracted worldwide attention--speakers at the rally included representatives of revolutionary movements in Chile, Italy, and Greece. Two members of the Irish Republican Army expressed their solidarity with the peasants of the Larzac, and declared support for resistance \\"by whatever means are necessary.\\" Police surveillance at this rally was minimal, with a single Gendarmerie helicopter overhead. A second mass rally at Rajal del Guorp took place a year later, 17/18 August 1974. This time the organisers claimed even more than 100,000 protesters. Fran√ßois Mitterrand made an appearance, and was pelted with pebbles by militant Maoists Since they happened in mid-summer, at the height of the tourist season, these and other gatherings inevitably had something of the atmosphere of festivals, regardless of the seriousness of their intent. Musical instruments and topless young women were much in evidence, and commemorative T-shirts quickly appeared in local markets. A few concerts were organised, such as that by Graeme Allwright in 1973. Allwright later wrote a song entitled Larzac 1975. Even Jos√© Bov√© referred to those rallies with some pride as \\"the French Woodstock\\", but he also recognised that the overall effect on public relations was decidedly mixed.  Paris marches More ingenious tactics were soon put in play. On 25 October 1974, a flock of 60 sheep were transported to Paris and set to grazing on the Champ de Mars, right under the Eiffel Tower. To inquiring gendarmes, the shepherds explained that it was publicity for Roquefort cheese. Earlier, a protest march on Paris had been triggered by the signature of the decree of expropriation in the public interest, on 26 December 1972. The march began on the following 7 January, with stops at Rodez, Saint-Flour, Clermont- Ferrand, Nevers and Orl√©ans. At each stop, marchers were welcomed and lodged by local committees. Meetings, rallies, and press conferences were organised. Police and local authorities were much less welcoming. The marchers were harassed at every stop-over. Finally, at Orl√©ans, the procession was blocked by the CRS (French riot police) and their 26 tractors impounded. Bernard Lambert, leader of the Mouvement des Paysans Travailleurs (Working Peasant Movement), promptly arranged for the loan of 26 tractors belonging to farmers in the Orl√©ans area, the CRS were outflanked, and the march proceeded to Paris. A second Paris march began on 2 December 1978. 18 Larzac farmers walked 710 km in 25 stages. The CRS blocked the centre of Paris, but 40,000 supporters rallied on the outskirts, making the largest demonstration of the year. The final Paris action began on 27 November 1980, at the height of the presidential campaigns of Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. Mitterrand, notwithstanding his treatment at the hands of militants at Rajal del Guorp in 1974, had taken a position against the base extension. Giscard was in favour of it. The action consisted of an encampment, in bitterly cold weather, on the Champ de Mars complete with farm animals, bales of straw, a radio station and a media information bureau. The demonstrators were forcibly removed after a few days, but the point had been made.  Civil disobedience  Lanza del Vasto and his wife Chanterelle during his hunger strike. As early as 1972, the communard, philosopher and theorist of non-violence Lanza del Vasto had taken an interest in the plight of the Larzac shepherds and farmers. Del Vasto's commune, the Community of the Ark, was nearby on the plateau de l'Escandorgue. He and his followers were skilled at civil disobedience action, veterans of hunger strikes against the use of torture during the Algerian war, and against nuclear weapons. On 19 March Lanza del Vasto began a 15-day hunger strike at La Cavalerie. He was joined by four local residents: Etienne Paloc, Pierre Bastide, and Pierre & Christiane Burgui√®re. Mme Burgui√®re recalled the impact it had on them. In 2011 she told film-maker Christian Rouaud \\"it was amazing, in a moral sense. When we came back, I felt I was no longer the same. Yes. Something had happened.\\" Civil disobedience was also partly the motive of the decision to rebuild the ruined stone sheep shelter (bergerie) at La Blaqui√®re. The property belonged to activist Auguste Guiraud, and was due for expropriation under the terms of the decree. On 10 June 1973 re-construction began in defiance of the expropriation order and the fact that planning permission had not been granted. Hundreds of supporters came to join the effort, notably the hippie contingent who had to learn the art and craft of masonry very quickly, and, it must be said, with somewhat random results. Pierre Bonnefous recalled: To say that the influx of hippies shocked the locals is an understatement. Marizette Tarlier recalled that it was the first time she'd seen bare-breasted women in public. The eight months of construction were marked by constant argument and conflict, but the bergerie was finished in February 1974 and stands to this day as a kind of monument to the joint effort. French military police (CRS) evacuating activists French military police (CRS) Police evacuating activists Another tactic that was used with success was to sell very small parcels of land to many sympathisers, with the aim of making the eventual expropriation as difficult as possible for the bureaucracy. Between 1973 and 1981, 6,180 tiny plots were allocated to 3,500 different people , and to make the act of expropriation even more difficult, many of these \\"landowners\\" lived abroad. In 1976, the fight escalated after soldiers blew up Auguste Guiraud's house in La Blaqui√®re during the night. Miraculously, Guiraud and his seven children were unharmed. On 22 June, a group of 22 activists entered the Larzac military base and destroyed 500 documents containing details of the expropriation. They were arrested and arraigned in Millau the next day. They were sentenced to prison terms varying from three to six months, but in fact none actually served more than three weeks . On 21 October 1977, a series of trials of Larzac activists took place in Millau. A sm√∂rg√•sbord of charges included disobedience of authority, removal of army property, blocking traffic, etc. The hearings were much disrupted by the deliberate release of a flock of sheep in the courtroom.  Organisation of the collective  To run the campaign in orderly fashion, an executive committee was formed and put in charge. Once general assemblies became more frequent, regional committees (Larzac-East, West, North, South and La Cavalerie) were formed. A firm rule, never broken over the ten years of the campaign, was that only actual residents of the Larzac had voting power in the general assemblies. Decisions were normally made by general consensus, with the exception of decisions pertaining to negotiations with the government in 1977. These were by democratic vote. Meetings were held at least weekly for the entire ten years of the campaign. The organisers were in frequent contact with other civil disobedience actions elsewhere in France, as well as the anti-nuclear movement. Another bergerie was built at the site of the proposed nuclear power station at Plogoff, and the Larzac contributed 20 ewes to the action. In all, some 150 committees were formed to encourage and support various political actions, not just in France but in other European countries. 28 October 1978 saw a national day of action organised by the Larzac committees. Marches, meetings, and hunger strikes were attended by tens of thousands of sympathisers. Jean-Paul Sartre sent a letter of support, including these words: In 1975 the movement started its own newspaper, Gardarem lo Larzac. The first edition was published on 6 June and the journal eventually had 4,000 subscribers. In February 1979, local referenda were organised in the surrounding communities of Millau, Creissels, and La Couvertoirade (a medieval city of the Knights Templar.) 88 to 95% of the electorate voted NO to the extension of the military base.  Victory  In May 1980, the Cour de Cassation, France's appeal court of last resort, annulled the 66 ongoing expropriation processes. Once Fran√ßois Mitterrand was duly elected President on 10 May, he declared the base extension project formally abandoned in the Council of Ministers. Property already acquired by the State for the project was leased back to the private company Terres du Larzac (Larzac Soils). Victory was complete, but Lanza del Vasto did not live to see it. He had died on 5 January, at the age of 79.Official Del Vasto web site  Further reading  * March 1981 issue of Dessine-moi le Larzac. 1971 ‚Äì 1981, dix ans de luttes dix ans de dessins by the Comit√© Larzac de Paris.

The band consists of Zachary Cole Smith (vocals, guitar), Andrew Bailey (guitar), Colin Caulfield (bass, keyboards, guitar, vocals) and Ben Newman (drums). Initially called Dive, the band started as Smith's solo recording project. After releasing three singles‚Äî\\"Sometime\\", \\"Human\\" and \\"Geist\\"‚Äîon Captured Tracks, DIIV released its debut studio album, Oshin, on June 26, 2012. In 2016, the band released its second studio album, Is the Is Are, after a lengthy and troubled gestation period.Interview with Still in Rock, December 2015 ‚ÄúStill in Rock‚Äù On October 4, 2019, DIIV's third album, Deceiver, was released on Captured Tracks. History=2011-2013: Oshin Smith performing with DIIV in San Francisco in 2013 After a few years playing guitar with the psych-rock band Soft Black and playing drums for Beach Fossils, Zachary Cole Smith formed DIIV in 2011 as a forum for his own songs. He enlisted childhood friend Andrew Bailey (like Smith, from Connecticut) on guitar, bassist Devin Ruben Perez (from New York City), and ex-Smith Westerns drummer Colby Hewitt (from California) as his live band. Smith, who originally named the project \\"Dive\\" after the Nirvana song of the same name, explained to Pitchfork that \\"everybody in the band is a water sign, that's kind of why the name Dive really spoke to us all.\\" Smith would eventually change the spelling of the band's name after learning of the early-'90s Belgian industrial act by that name. Captured Tracks signed the band and released two singles, \\"Sometime\\" and \\"Human\\", which were recorded solely by Smith and had acted as demos. In May 2012, the band changed their name to DIIV, according to Smith, \\"out of respect for Dirk Ivens and the original Dive,\\" a 1990s Belgian industrial group. \\"We‚Äôve not been contacted by Dirk Ivens or his lawyers,\\" Smith said in a press release, \\"but the short of it is that I don‚Äôt really give a fuck what the band is called.\\" He continued, \\"I originated this project in a bedroom with no internet and didn‚Äôt know if it would ever leave the bedroom. 'DIVE', the word, was an element of what inspired the project in its genesis, but we‚Äôve outgrown the name and its associations. The band is the same, the music is the same, the future will always be the same. A name is nothing.\\" DIIV's debut album, Oshin, was released on June 26, 2012. It was preceded by the single \\"Geist\\" in April 2012 and the music video for \\"How Long Have You Known\\" in May 2012. The songs on Oshin were influenced by krautrock, C86 bands, Nirvana and world music. \\"People didn‚Äôt seem to pick up on the influence of these Malian guitar players, especially Baba Salah whose record I got at the library,\\" Smith said. \\"He's a huge star in Mali, but he has this one record called Borey and it was huge for me and influenced the way I experimented with melody.\\" DIIV supported English band The Vaccines on their UK tour during November 2012. DIIV also supported the Canadian duo Japandroids on their East Coast US tour in November‚ÄìDecember 2012. On lists of the top 50 albums of 2012, Oshin was listed 22nd by Stereogum and 40th by Pitchfork. In July 2013, multi-instrumentalist Colin Caulfield joined the band. Caulfield played keyboard and guitar for live shows, until late 2017, when he replaced Devin Ruben Perez on bass guitar. 2014-2017: Is the Is Are While touring in support of Oshin, DIIV played several unreleased songs live, including \\"Dust\\", \\"Loose Ends\\", and \\"Under the Sun\\". As of July 2014, Smith had written over 150 new songs since the release of Oshin. On March 9, 2015, DIIV began recording their second album, Is the Is Are, at Strange Weather Recording Studio in Brooklyn. Drummer Colby Hewitt left the band in spring 2015 due to his rumored drug addiction. Ben Newman, (from North Carolina, formerly of Banda Suki) who played on several \\"Oshin\\" tracks including \\"Doused\\" (credited as Ben Wolf) was added as the group's drummer in April 2015, and played on the bulk of Is the Is Are. On September 16, 2015, DIIV released the first single from Is the Is Are, \\"Dopamine\\". They shared a second song from the album, \\"Bent (Roi's Song)\\", on November 4, 2015, followed by \\"Mire (Grant's Song)\\" on November 25. \\"Under the Sun\\" was released as a single on December 13. Is the Is Are was released on February 5, 2016. The album debuted at number 81 on the US Billboard 200. The release was followed by a February tour in Australia as part of St Jerome's Laneway Festival. However, just two days prior to the release, on February 3, Smith announced he was checking in for \\"long-haul\\" inpatient treatment. On March 26, 2016, the Liverpool venue Arts Club, which DIIV was scheduled to perform at on March 27, announced that the remainder of DIIV's European tour was canceled \\"due to an urgent health issue\\", which was later confirmed by DIIV's representatives. In an interview with NME in October 2019, bassist Colin Caulfield commented on this period in the band's career, \\"It definitely felt like an end point... I had tried really hard to be as supportive as possible for a long time. It was a hands up moment, it was the type of realization Cole had to come to himself. And he did, which is great.\\"Read more at https://www.nme.com/music-interviews/diiv-interview- looking-easy-solution-addiction-found-theres-not- one-2555618#SJCL5P5R2xrlJhet.99 This period also saw the band take part in very occasional interviews with the media, with the band remaining relatively out of the public eye more than ever. Throughout 2016-2018 DIIV released a vast selection of cover songs, with the group performing songs by Elliott Smith, Cat Power, Sparklehorse and (Sandy) Alex G and My Bloody Valentine. Later in 2017, DIIV also parted ways with bassist Devin Ruben Perez after earlier controversy arose from the revelation that Perez had posted anti- Semitic, racist, homophobic, and sexist comments on 4chan. 2018-present: Deceiver In the aftermath of Cole‚Äôs personal struggles, he \\"finally accepted what it means to go through treatment and committed,\\" emerging with a renewed focus and perspective. Getting back together with the band in Los Angeles would result in a series of firsts. This would be the first time DIIV wrote and recorded a record as a band with bassist Colin Caulfield bringing in demos, writing alongside Cole, and the entire band contributing to the songwriting process of every song. In an interview, Colin explained the writing process, \\"Cole and I approached writing vocal melodies the same way the band approached the instrumentals,\\" says Colin. \\"We threw ideas at the wall for months on end, slowly making sense of everything. It was a constant conversation about the parts we liked best versus which of them served the album best.\\" DIIV, now a four piece without Devin Ruben Perez, premiered new songs while touring with Deafheaven in the fall of 2018. Produced primarily by the band themselves along with producer Sonny Diperri (My Bloody Valentine, Nine Inch Nails), the album was recorded in Los Angeles in March 2019. On April 26, 2019, DIIV announced that their upcoming third album would be released this year via their Instagram account. On the same day, Pitchfork reported their announcement on the new album, and confirmed through a representative of DIIV, that Devin Ruben Perez had been dismissed from the band at the end of 2017. On July 24, 2019, DIIV released their first single in over three years, \\"Skin Game\\" and announced that their new album, Deceiver, will be released on October 4, 2019. On August 22, 2019, DIIV released their second single from Deceiver, titled, \\"Taker\\". On September 18, 2019, DIIV released their third single from Deceiver, entitled, \\"Blankenship\\". Upon release, Deceiver reached number 177 on the US Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from DIIV's earlier work. Many critics commented on its darker and heavier sound and lyrical themes. In his review for Q, Dave Everley praised the album, calling it \\"a success as both an artistic statement and a mea culpa.\\" In a positive review, Jordan Bassett of NME wrote, \\"Where its predecessor was airy and spaced-out, Deceiver packs some seriously heavy riffs, sliding between monster rockers and moon-eyed grunge ballads that wouldn't sound too out of place on an early Smashing Pumpkins record.\\" Band members= Current members  * Zachary Cole Smith ‚Äì lead vocals, guitar (2011‚Äìpresent) * Andrew Bailey ‚Äì guitar (2011‚Äìpresent) * Colin Caulfield ‚Äì bass (2018‚Äìpresent); backing vocals (2013‚Äìpresent); keyboards, guitar (2013‚Äì2018) * Ben Newman ‚Äì drums (2015‚Äìpresent)  Former members  * Devin Ruben Perez ‚Äì bass (2011‚Äì2017) * Gryphon Graham ‚Äì keyboards, guitar, backing vocals (2013) * Colby Hewitt ‚Äì drums (2011‚Äì2015) Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:20 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:80 top:0 right:30 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:2011 till:01/08/2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:2 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2011 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2011 Colors = id:lvocals value:red legend:Lead_vocals id:bvocals value:pink legend:Backing_vocals id:guitar value:green legend:Guitar id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:keyboards value:purple legend:Keyboards id:drums value:orange legend:Drums id:lines value:black legend:Studio_album LineData = at:26/06/2012 color:lines layer:back at:05/02/2016 color:lines layer:back at:04/10/2019 color:lines layer:back BarData = bar:Zachary text:\\"Zachary Cole Smith\\" bar:Andrew text:\\"Andrew Bailey\\" bar:Devin text:\\"Devin Ruben Perez\\" bar:Gryphon text:\\"Gryphon Graham\\" bar:Colin text:\\"Colin Caulfield\\" bar:Colby text:\\"Colby Hewitt\\" bar:Ben text:\\"Ben Newman\\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,0) bar:Zachary from:01/01/2011 till:end color:lvocals bar:Zachary from:01/01/2011 till:end color:guitar width:3 bar:Andrew from:01/01/2011 till:end color:guitar bar:Devin from:01/01/2011 till:15/12/2017 color:bass bar:Gryphon from:01/05/2013 till:01/07/2013 color:keyboards bar:Gryphon from:01/05/2013 till:01/07/2013 color:guitar width:7 bar:Gryphon from:01/05/2013 till:01/07/2013 color:bvocals width:3 bar:Colin from:02/07/2013 till:15/12/2017 color:keyboards bar:Colin from:02/07/2013 till:15/12/2017 color:guitar width:7 bar:Colin from:16/12/2017 till:end color:bass bar:Colin from:02/07/2013 till:end color:bvocals width:3 bar:Colby from:01/01/2011 till:01/04/2015 color:drums bar:Ben from:02/04/2015 till:end color:drums Discography DIIV in 2012  Studio albums  * Oshin (2012) * Is the Is Are (2016) * Deceiver (2019)  Singles  * \\"Sometime\\" (2011) * \\"Human\\" (2011) * \\"Geist\\" (2012) * \\"How Long Have You Known\\" promo (2012) * \\"Dopamine\\" (2015) * \\"Bent (Roi's Song)\\" (2015) * \\"Under the Sun\\" (2015) * \\"Is the Is Are\\" (2016) * \\"Skin Game\\" (2019) *\\"Taker\\" (2019) *\\"Blankenship\\" (2019) Limited singles * \\"Cow/Icehead\\" (2017)  Music videos  * \\"How Long Have You Known?\\" (2012) * \\"Doused\\" (2012) * \\"Wait\\" (2013) * \\"Blankenship\\" (2019) * \\"Skin Game\\" (2019) * \\"The Spark\\" (2020) ReferencesExternal links DIIV at Captured Tracks 2011 establishments in New York City Dream pop musical groups Indie rock musical groups from New York (state) Musical groups established in 2011 Musical groups from Brooklyn Musical quartets Shoegazing musical groups Captured Tracks artists ","title":"DIIV"},{"id":"36021314","text":"The Cascade Canyon Trail is a round-trip long hiking trail in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. state of Wyoming.

The idea of the event comes from the Rector of the Adam Mickiewicz University, while the organisers are the University, the AMU Chamber Choir and AMU Chamber Choir Friends' Association. The organisers would like to establish a musical bridge connecting universities from all over the world. His artistic director is Polish conductor Krzysztof Szydzisz. Around 6000 students from 23 countries participated in eleven festival editions. The festival concerts, which take place in the University Concert Hall and other venues of the Wielkopolska Province, aim at showing the rich musical variety of the groups and culture of the represented countries (the choirs perform music from the country of origin), creating atmosphere of openness and tolerance and inspiring cultural exchange. The very important assumption of the festival is to present Polish music to the foreign participants - every other year all invited singers work together on the Polish contemporary work. The culmination of the event is the final concert that includes each choir presentation and the performance of the Polish contemporary piece prepared during the workshops by the massed choirs.

History of study  The type species, Parioxys ferricolus, was named in 1878 by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope based on two badly preserved skulls that were collected from the early Permian Texas red- beds. Egyptian paleontologist, Youssef S. Moustafa, described new material of P. ferricolus from other localities in Texas. Moustafa also described another species, P. romeri, on the basis of an isolated humerus, but this was regarded as being indeterminate. A second definitive species, P. bolli, was described by Canadian paleontologist Robert Carroll in 1964. This taxon is only known from postcranial material.  Relationships  Parioxys was historically considered to be closely related to eryopoids, more specifically the well- known Eryops megalocephalus, which was collected from the same locality as the type material of P. ferricolus. Cope himself listed P. ferricolus as a species of Eryops, possibly because he considered it to be a juvenile specimen of Eryops. It was shortly revived as a distinct genus with a suggestion that the original specimen's described by Cope might have been inadvertently described as other taxa by other authors, but its affinities continued to be debated, with some suggestions that it might instead belong to the Trematopidae. Moustafa (1955a) placed Parioxys in its own family and suggested that it was related to the Dissorophidae. Schoch & Milner (2014) placed Parioxys within Dissorophidae based on personal observations of further preparation of historic material, although this has not been tested in a phylogenetic analysis due to the poor quality of much of the material.

It expands on existing surround sound systems by adding height channels, allowing sounds to be interpreted as three-dimensional objects. Following the release of Atmos for the cinema market, a variety of consumer technologies have been released under the Atmos brand, using in-ceiling and up-firing speakers. History Dolby Atmos Monitor at SoundFirm, Melbourne, Australia The first Dolby Atmos installation was in the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles, for the premiere of Brave in June 2012. Throughout 2012, it saw a limited release of about 25 installations worldwide, with an increase to 300 locations in 2013. There were over 6,000 locations as of July 2020. Dolby Atmos has also been adapted to a home theater format and is the audio component of Dolby Cinema. Most electronic devices since 2016, as well as smartphones after 2017, have been enabled for Dolby Atmos recording and mixing. The full set of technical specifications for Dolby Digital Plus with Dolby Atmos are standardized and published in ETSI TS 103 420. Game of Thrones was the first television show mixed in Atmos, beginning with its 2016 Blu-ray reissue. R.E.M.'s 1992 album Automatic for the People was the first major music release with its 25th anniversary reissue in 2017. Technology Old Dolby Atmos logo, used from 2012 to 2019 Dolby Atmos technology allows up to 128 audio tracks plus associated spatial audio description metadata (most notably, location or pan automation data) to be distributed to theaters for optimal, dynamic rendering to loudspeakers based on the theater capabilities. Each audio track can be assigned to an audio channel, the conventional format for distribution, or to an audio \\"object.\\" Dolby Atmos by default, has a 10-channel 7.1.2 bed for ambience stems or center dialogue, leaving 118 tracks for objects. Dolby Atmos home theaters can be built upon conventional 5.1 and 7.1 layouts. For Dolby Atmos, the nomenclature differs slightly: a 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos system is a conventional 7.1 layout with four overhead or Dolby Atmos enabled speakers. With audio objects, Dolby Atmos enables the re-recording mixer using a Pro Tools and Nuendo plugin (available from Dolby) or a Dolby Atmos equipped large format audio mixing console such as AMS Neve's DFC or Harrison's MPC5, to designate the apparent source location in the theater for each sound, as a three-dimensional rectangular coordinate relative to the defined audio channel locations and theater boundaries. During playback, each theater's Dolby Atmos system renders the audio objects in real-time such that each sound is coming from its designated spot with respect to the loudspeakers present in the target theater. By way of contrast, conventional multichannel technology essentially burns all the source audio tracks into a fixed number of channels during post-production. This has conventionally forced the re- recording mixer to make assumptions about the playback environment that may not apply very well to a particular theater. The addition of audio objects allows the mixer to be more creative, to bring more sounds off the screen, and be confident of the results. The first-generation cinema hardware, the \\"Dolby Atmos Cinema Processor,\\" supports up to 128 discrete audio tracks and up to 64 unique speaker feeds. The technology was initially created for commercial cinema applications, and was later adapted to home cinema. In addition to playing back a standard 5.1 or 7.1 mix using loudspeakers grouped into arrays, the Dolby Atmos system can also give each loudspeaker its own unique feed based on its exact location, thereby enabling many new front, surround, and even ceiling-mounted height channels for the precise panning of select sounds such as a helicopter or rain. Consumer implementations=Home theater version At the end of June 2014, Dolby Labs' hardware partners announced that Dolby Atmos would soon be coming to home theaters. Dolby Atmos enabled movies are available with Kaleidescape's movie players. Among them were several established manufacturers of audiovisual home entertainment devices announcing new products that have now brought Dolby Atmos into home theaters across the globe. Products offered range from premium home cinema receivers and preamplifiers to mid-range home-theater-in-a-box (HTiB) packages of well- known brands such as Denon, Marantz, Onkyo, Pioneer and Yamaha plus further models from lesser-known manufacturers and brands. On June 4, 2018, Apple announced that tvOS 12 for AppleTV 4K will support Dolby Atmos when released in Fall 2018. The first movie to be released on Blu-ray with Dolby Atmos was Transformers: Age of Extinction. The first video game to use Dolby Atmos was Star Wars: Battlefront with a special agreement between EA and Dolby Laboratories. This game uses HDMI bitstreaming from the PC to deliver Atmos audio to consumer Audio-Visual Receivers. Overwatch and Battlefield 1 for PC also have Atmos audio. On the Xbox One, Crackdown 3 and Gears of War 4 also support Atmos. Dolby Atmos for Music, an audio-only iteration of the format was adopted by streaming music services Tidal and Amazon Music in December 2019, however it could only be enjoyed via headphones, a compromise at best. In May 2020 Tidal announced that the Dolby Atmos bitstream would be available over HDMI allowing Dolby Atmos Music to be enjoyed on home theatre AV systems with a Dolby Atmos decoder and compatible soundbars. Dolby Atmos Music is only available to Tidal HiFi tier subscribers. Compatible streaming players include the Apple TV 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Cube, Fire TV Stick (second gen), Fire TV (third gen), and NVIDIA Shield TV. Sennheiser launched a new Soundbar with built-in Dolby Atmos technology named AMBEO Soundbar at the 2019 CES in Las Vegas. The Soundbar utilizes analysis of a room's reflective characteristics to enable a single-unit 5.1.4 setup. =Implementation and differences from commercial implementations= Because of limited bandwidth and lack of processing power, Atmos in home theaters is not rendered the same way as in cinemas. A spatially-coded substream is added to Dolby TrueHD or Dolby Digital Plus or is present as metadata in Dolby MAT 2.0, LPCM like format. This substream is an efficient representation of the full, original object-based mix. This is not a matrix-encoded channel, but a spatially- encoded digital signal with panning metadata. Atmos in home theaters can support 24.1.10 channels, it also can do up to 118 dynamical simultaneous objects with 10 bed channels and uses the spatially-encoded object audio substream to mix the audio presentation to match the installed speaker configuration. In order to reduce the bitrate, nearby objects and speakers are clustered together to form aggregate objects, which are then dynamically panned in the process that Dolby calls spacial coding. The sound of the original objects may be spread over multiple aggregate objects to maintain the power and position of the original objects. The spatial resolution (and hence the strength of the clustering) can be controlled by the filmmakers when they use the Dolby Atmos Production Suite tools. Dolby Digital Plus has also been updated with Atmos extensions. Headphone and smartphone implementations Dolby Atmos also has headphone implementations for PCs, the Xbox One, and mobile phones. They work by using audio processing algorithms to convert the Atmos object metadata into a binaural 360¬∞ output using the usual two headphone speakers. This technique is an improvement on the previous Dolby Headphone technology, allowing for infinite channels of sound to be processed into a virtual surround experience. Windows 10 Version 1703 Creators Update added platform-level support for spatial sound processing including both Windows Sonic for Headphones and Dolby Atmos for Headphones. Dolby Atmos for headphones requires a licence to function which can be purchased or redeemed inside the Dolby Access app. Dolby Atmos has smartphone implementations for devices including but not limited to the iPhone XS/XR and later (when running iOS 13 or later), the Razer Phone and Razer Phone 2, the ZTE Axon 7, Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+, Samsung Galaxy S9/S9+, Samsung Note 9, Galaxy Note 8, Samsung Galaxy J8, Samsung Galaxy J6, Galaxy S10 series, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Samsung Galaxy A20, Samsung Galaxy A30 Samsung Galaxy A10, Samsung Galaxy M20, Samsung Galaxy M30, Samsung Galaxy M30s, Sony Xperia 1, Lenovo K8 Note, Lenovo K5 Note, Huawei Mate P20 Pro, Huawei Pro 30 and Nokia 6.

During the silent and talkies era of the German cinema, she appeared in several movies as a supporting actress. When Adolf Hitler came to power, Forescu, like other Jews of that period, was barred from her profession. She died in the Buchenwald concentration camp in Germany.  Biography  Forescu was born Maria F√ºllenbaum on 15 January 1875, in Czernowitz, Austria-Hungary. She attended a boarding school in Paris. She studied singing, music and drama at the Prague Conservatory. Around the turn of the century, she debuted as an operetta singer and soon became a well known member of the renowned Viennese Carl Theater. She also performed in several of the tours organized by the theater throughout Europe. Then she went to Berlin, where she appeared at the theater of the West, at the Operetta Theater, and the Metropolitan Theater. She made her film acting debut in 1911 with the Charles Paulus-directed Die Pflicht. She left singing in 1915 to concentrate on her film acting career. She mainly appeared as a supporting actress. After the advent of the talkies she acted in several films of her friend Harry Piel. She had played the character of Yelina in the crime film Marizza. The most popular films in which Maria Forescu acted were the Gerhard Lamprecht-directed Between Night and Dawn and the Hans Behrendt-directed Danton (both 1931). In the 1929 film Der Sittenrichter. ¬ß 218. Eine wahre Begebenheit, Forescu played the woman who aborted the heroine's child. The film was considered controversial for depicting the topic of abortion. She also starred in the 1920 silent film The Women House of Brescia. The film was rejected by the British Board of Film Classification. In 1932, after filming Das erste Recht des Kindes (directed by Fritz Wendhausen), her career was cut short by the new laws made by the Nazi party. She was deprived of living a respected life and was prohibited from engaging in any professional activities. Forescu, who was of Jewish origin, was expelled from the Reich Student Council film in 1938. After the expulsion and the rising hatred against the Jews she took refuge with Maria Hirschburg on the Motzstrasse in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. She died in the Buchenwald concentration camp on 23 November 1943. Throughout her career she had acted in approximately 160 films.

The film was released on July 7, 2010. Plot synopsis Paul, part-time laborer and amateur artist, leads an unremarkable life like any other, until his world is disrupted by vivid revelations of the afterlife. At first a welcome respite from reality, his waking visions soon reveal a demonic conspiracy at work within his own community. One by one, prominent members of high society fall victim to a series of mysterious assassination attempts. As the government scrambles to contain the rising panic of the ruling class, public disillusionment grows. Amidst the maelstrom, Paul becomes entangled in a web of powerful elite, evangelical cults, and a plot that could not only bring down the country's economy, but also incite the total collapse of society. Production The film was mostly shot before the 2008 Icelandic financial crash that shocked the world, and it inadvertently became a prediction of the chaos that followed. Bo√∞beri is notable for being made without any public funding which is unusual for a theatrically distributed film in Iceland. Visual effects Bo√∞beri had numerous visual effects shot, most notably the explosion of the House of Parliament (Al√æingi) in Reykjav√≠k. Marketing Before its premiere, Bo√∞beri was marketed both online and on local TV stations. A theatrical trailer was premiered in May 2010. Release Bo√∞beri was released nationwide to cinemas on July 7, 2010. November 2010 saw its DVD release, and it was released on video-on-demand the following month. The film has yet to be featured on Icelandic television networks nor has it been made available for digital download. Reception Bo√∞beri was met with polarized reviews; some praised the effort the filmmakers undertook while others were less enthusiastic, criticizing the incoherent plot and alleged mixed performances. It remains one of Iceland's most controversial movies to date.

The film is set on an unnamed Japanese island and tells the story of a vacationing university professor who comes in contact with several eccentric local inhabitants. The movie is a follow-up to Ogigami's 2006 film Kamome Shokudo, and features two of the same actors. It was featured at several film festivals including the Sundance Film Festival. During production, Ogigami decided the title of the movie after an impromptu realization that all of the characters in the film wore glasses.  Plot  Megane tells the story of Taeko (Satomi Kobayashi), an uptight city woman, vacationing on a quaint Japanese island (later identified by the director as Yoron Island, Okinawa). Upon arriving at the Hamada Inn, she meets the eccentric inhabitants of the island: Sakura (Masako Motai), a mysterious older woman who runs a shaved ice stand on the island during the spring season, but accepts no money; Haruna (Mikako Ichikawa), a biology teacher who sighs about the lack of cute boys in her class; and Yuji the innkeeper (Ken Mitsuishi) who draws confusing maps and boasts the lack of cell phone reception at his hotel. The first morning of her vacation Taeko is woken by a kneeling Sakura at her bedside, who greets her with a cheerful Ohayo gozaimasu (good morning) and invites her to join in the island's morning aerobics. Taeko declines but later wanders down to the beach to watch the islanders performing what Yuji calls their \\"merci\\" exercises, a light aerobics program invented by Sakura. Taeko's fish-out-of-water feelings are only accentuated when Yuji attempts to explain \\"twilighting\\" to her, a local pastime consisting of thinking while staring off into the horizon. After a few days Taeko becomes fed up with the quirkiness of the inn's residents and checks into the Marine Palace, the island's other hotel, but rapidly realizes that the forced labor mentality at the Marine Palace is not to her liking. Lost but rescued by Sakura on a tricycle, Taeko returns to the inn where she is later joined by a former student, Yomogi (Ryo Kase) and slowly learns to accept and then love the inn's unique way of living.  Cast  *Satomi Kobayashi as Taeko *Masako Motai as Sakura *Mikako Ichikawa as Haruna *Ken Mitsuishi as Yuji *Ryo Kase as Yomogi  Themes  A major theme of the movie is the importance of taking one's time and appreciating life, contrasted to Taeko's normal urban lifestyle and mindset. Many scenes of the movie quietly depict simple moments of life like eating, watching the ocean, or playing a mandolin. Henry Stewart of The L Magazine described Megane as \\"an ode to the pleasures of unhurried living.\\" Another critic said of the film, \\"On this paradisical island little else matters beyond the recharging of spiritual batteries and the enjoyment of eating.\\" Sakura is the epitome of this ideal ‚Äì waiting intently in front of a cooking bean pot in order to turn off the heat at exactly the right moment or painstakingly preparing her special shaved ice. The film's plot is purposely slow-paced, a fact which Ogigami acknowledged at the San Francisco festival screening when she issued a sleep warning to the audience, all the while implying that such an act was in accordance with the spirit of the movie.  Reception  The film was featured at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize, and San Francisco International Film Festival. The International Federation of Film Critics awarded Megane with a Special Jury Mention in 2008, \\"[f]or the freshness and optimism of the comedy, that glides along at an unexpectedly serene pace.\\" At the Berlin International Film Festival Megane won the Manfred Salzberger Award for \\"broadening the boundaries of cinema today.\\" The film was also shown at the 2010 Nippon Connection film festival in Frankfurt, Germany and the 2011 Japanese Film Festival in Singapore. Reviews were mixed. John Anderson of Variety Magazine called the film \\"a vaguely magical, insistently modern fable that could become an arthouse hit\\", praising the film's acting, production values, and \\"extraordinarily confident direction.\\" One professor of Japanese cinema called it \\"the perfect antidote to the trite 3D fare Hollywood's been throwing at us of late.\\" However, not all reviews were so high-minded. The film received a 40 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Nick Shager of Slant Magazine gave the movie one star out of four, calling it pretentious and \\"just about insufferable,\\" and David Fear of Time Out called it \\"the cinematic equivalent of a rock-garden tchotchke sold as exotica to tourists.\\" Megane has also achieved the status of art film and has been featured in various museum presentations, including at the Maison de la Culture du Japon in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Roth at White House Summit on Organ Donation (June 2016) Healthcare Operations and Policy. At Allegheny General Hospital, Tayur has conducted clinical trials that have established the clinical benefits of genotype guided therapeutic dosing of warfarin therapy. Tayur's work with Dr. Bennet Omalu, whose discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was featured in the movie Concussion, applies OM methods to improve Medical Examiner Offices. In the area of long- term care, Tayur has examined ways to improve the consistency of staffing and proposed an \\"on-call pool\\" approach. To address the fundamental problem of scarcity of supply of organs, Tayur collaborates with the New Jersey Sharing Network, part of the United Network for Organ Sharing, investigating behavioral economic approaches that will increase the consent rate of the legal next-of-kin of deceased individuals. This work attracted the attention of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and was featured in the 24th Association for Multicultural Affairs in Transplantation Annual Meeting in 2016. Tayur also supports finding other innovative methods to increase organ donation and supports the need for clarification to be able to conduct further research. Tayur has also engaged other researchers, transplant surgeons, and policy bodies, as well as students, by serving on the organizing committee of the 2016 Johns Hopkins Symposium on Healthcare Operations, with a theme of \\"When Organ Transplantation meets Operations Research,\\" and by speaking on \\"Effective and Innovative Solutions to Increase Organ Donation\\" at the Harvard Effective Altruist Chapter. Tayur has also studied personalized treatment for opioid use disorder, specifically, the efficacy of using wearables to prevent relapse.

In 2018, Tayur was chosen by Indian Institute of Technology Madras as a recipient of the 2018 Distinguished Alumni Awards (DAA). ‚ÄúAcademic Capitalist‚Äù As a serial entrepreneur and an active promoter of monetizing operations research, Tayur coined the term ‚Äúacademic capitalist.‚Äù\\"Academic Capitalist\\" is similar to \\"Scientific Entrepreneur\\" (See \\"The Scientific Life; A moral history of a late modern vocation\\", by Steven Shapin), and can be considered as a modern version of \\"craftsman-scholar\\" (See \\"The Lever of Riches; Technological Creativity and Economic Progress\\", by Joel Mokyr). Tayur is a charter member of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), and has served as a mentor for TiE ScaleUp. SmartOps In 2000, Tayur founded the software company SmartOps Corporation, after winning the First Prize in the EnterPrize Case Competition that year, and served as its CEO until 2012. The company raised Series A funding within 45 days, became profitable in 2003, and has experienced revenue growth every year since its inception. Through SmartOps, Tayur also coined the phrase \\"fix the mix\\" to refer to the approach of adjusting inventory levels for various items to meet target service levels with lower overall inventory investment. Several SmartOps customers, including Cabot Corporation, Celestica, ConAgra, Dow Chemical Company, Johnson & Johnson, Kohler Company, Lubrizol, LSI Corporation, Medtronic, PPG Industries, Wyeth, have spoken about their successes with Enterprise Inventory Optimization (EIO). SmartOps was in a revenue sharing contract agreement with SAP AG, until February 2013, when SAP AG announced that it would acquire SmartOps to develop a real-time supply chain software that allows its customers to \\"run their businesses in real time‚Äîto analyze, predict, react and adjust instantly.\\" Through this acquisition, SAP was able to offer an integrated inventory management software, allowing its clients to \\"manage the increased supply chain risk due to economic uncertainty, escalating customer expectations, demand volatility, and supply variability they face.\\" Tayur has been recognized for his entrepreneurship of SmartOps Corporation by the Carnegie Science Center Award for Innovation in Information Technology, and has been the subject of University of Virginia Darden School of Business's MBA Teaching case ‚ÄúSmartOps Corporation: Forging Smart Alliances?‚Äù  OrganJet and GuardianWings  In 2011, Tayur founded the social enterprise OrganJet Corporation, which facilities multiple listing and provides on-demand private jet transportation for patients to receive organ transplantation in a wider geographic range. Since the founding of OrganJet, Tayur's \\"entrepreneurial approach to reform [the] organ waiting list\\" has caught the attention of Nobel Laureate Alvin E. Roth, among other preeminent economists. In addition, OrganJet has been covered by the AOL/MAKERS initiative and by the media in regions suffering from geographic disparity in waiting times for organ transplants, such as Boston, Denver, and Wisconsin. In July 2012, with the founding of GuardianWings, Tayur became the first social entrepreneur to start a ‚Äúcontract hybrid,‚Äù in which a for-profit entity (OrganJet) is symbiotically integrated with a not-for-profit subsidiary (GuardianWings) sharing a common social mission of providing inclusive access to organ transplantation. The notion of ‚Äúcontract hybrids,‚Äù as a new legal entity, was first proposed by Bromberger (2011) as a method to obtain the best of ‚Äúfor-profit‚Äù and ‚Äúnot-for- profit‚Äù entities, and further explored by Battilana et al. (2012) A 2013 Harvard Business School case titled \\"OrganJet and GuardianWings\\" (by Julie Battilana and James Weber), covering the decision process behind the organizational structure of OrganJet and GuardianWings, has been taught at Harvard Business School. The case has also been used by University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, among other business schools, in its course \\"The Corporation in Society,\\" where Tayur was interviewed by the instructor Jim Walsh. Students were asked to write responses to the question \\"If you were Sridhar Tayur, how do you think about your aspirations to establish OrganJet and GuardianWings, change the current transplant system in America, honor your commitments to Carnegie-Mellon University, and live a full life?\\" In an interview with The Guardian, Tayur said that the hybrid model was more efficient than a traditional pure for-profit or not-for-profit: \\"It would have been much easier for me to have said it's a not-for-profit or a for-profit and satisfy the skeptics. But the primary goal of my company is to help as many people as possible get transplants quicker.\\" On August 7, 2013, it was announced that Irena Bucci, a resident of the Washington D.C. area, through the service provided by OrganJet, successfully received a kidney transplant in Pittsburgh, through the service provided by OrganJet. In June 2014, OrganJet sponsored a ‚ÄúTransplants‚Äù campaign with Mediaplanet and USA Today aiming to increase the public's awareness of the importance of organ donation. On August 20, 2013, OrganJet released a free self-service App to help chronic kidney disease patients find a low wait kidney transplant center in the US. Tayur with Amartya Sen at Harvard Square (May 2016) A 2014 piece in The Atlantic, \\"A Private Jet Is Waiting to Take You to Your Kidney Transplant\\" detailed Tayur's motivation behind founding OrganJet and the company's latest developments. In discussing geographic inequality in organ transplantation, a 2014 The New England Journal of Medicine article cited OrganJet as an example of mobilizing the recipients (instead of mobilizing the organs) that would face less of the \\"political resistance that has stood in the way of broader organ sharing to date.\\" The American Journal of Transplantation, in its February 2015 issue of \\"The AJT Report,\\" mentioned Tayur and his work through OrganJet as one of \\"grassroots groups and organizations formed to improve the quality of life for transplant candidates, recipients, their families, and the families of organ and tissue donors.\\" Tayur and OrganJet have also been profiled in The Craft of Creativity, Ars Technica, Forbes, and Vice News. OrganJet has been featured in research seminars in leading universities, including Cornell University, Harvard University, MIT, Stanford University, and University of Chicago. OrganJet has also been featured at Harvard Kennedy School's New World Social Enterprise Fellows Program, where Tayur showcased OrganJet as an operational example of John Rawls's difference principle, as well as at the Leadership for System Change: Delivering Social Impact at Scale Program for Schwab Fellows since 2017.  Limited partner in PE and VC firms  Tayur was a member of the advisory board and a limited partner of CCG Inc. (2001‚Äì2010), a private equity firm devoted to applying lean manufacturing techniques at small manufacturing firms and creating new jobs. He is a limited partner and member of the advisory board of NeoTribe Ventures.  Angel Investor and boards  He is an investor in and/or member of the advisory boards of Onera, Fathomd, VocaliD, and Zenrez. He was previously an advisor to MitraBiotech. In addition, he serves on the board of directors of Transplant Interface. He was a member of the board of directors of Orchestro, a software- as-a-service based analytics platform that was later acquired by E2open. ‚ÄúManagement mechanics‚Äù Tayur posing in a Caterpillar attachment whose supply chain he designed (1998) In line with Herbert A. Simon's reflection that ‚Äúexecutive centrifuges‚Äù are needed for a science of ‚Äújudgment mechanics,‚Äù Tayur proposed the term \\"management mechanics,\\" a methodical way to conduct quantitative-model-based \\"management consulting\\" that also allows for systematic implementation of sustaintable organizational change using enterprise information technology. A wide range of \\"what if\\" analysis allows senior executives to tackle practical problems in operations management (PPOMs) in the spirit of Peter Drucker's views on Management Science. PPOMs can lie \\"inside the factory,\\" \\"outside the factory,\\" or in the \\"interfaces between the inside and the outside of the factory.\\" PPOMs in product companies (across a variety of industries) include designing rapid response supply chains, optimizing product portfolios, implementing a postponement strategy, planning production with significant changeover times and costs, reducing net landed cost in procurement, optimizing working capital needs to meet service levels, operating a global supply chain using S&OP; process, quoting accurate lead times, and designing a seasonal logistics strategy through a gain sharing contract. Management Mechanics helps executives make sound judgements on strategic decisions that may span multiple organizational silos in their firm or even cross firm boundaries. In 1999, Tayur coined the term \\"planned spontaneity\\" to describe firms' supply-side strategy to create and respond to consumer demands spontaneously. The term has now been used to describe a new wave of technology enterprises aiming to satisfy last-minute consumer demands. Deep computing Through SmartOps, Tayur has also explored massively parallel versions of enterprise inventory optimization (EIO) algorithms on IBM's Blue Gene. In 2005, as Blue Gene's first supply chain application, the IBM-SmartOps pilot solved industrial scale problems with more than a million variables in 0.04 seconds on a \\"half rack\\" system with 512 processors.  Quantum computing  With the objective of \\"making quantum computing as a service a reality,\\" Tayur created the Quantum Computing Group at Carnegie Mellon in 2017 to study optimization problems‚Äïmotivated by operations research and operations management applications‚Äïby bringing ideas and methods from algebraic geometry, geometry of numbers and algebraic topology to quantum computing. The research program has three thrusts: # Use computational algebraic geometry and Knuth‚ÄìBendix completion algorithm to compile on quantum computers (both AQC and NISQ). # Develop novel hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and quantum-inspired classical Graver Augmented Multi-seed Algorithm (GAMA) for non-linear integer optimization with non-convex objective functions. The group has conducted numerical testing on D-Wave of their new hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to compute Graver basis, which is known to be useful in many applications of non-linear integer optimization and game theory and use it for optimization. The group has applied the above algorithms to Cancer Genomics to study acute myeloid leukemia. # The group is also the first to introduce Morse theory, Cerf theory (from algebraic topology), and Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem (from differential geometry) to understand adiabatic quantum computation at a fundamental level by studying the deformation of Hamiltonian surface and evolution of (and around) anti-crossings. In 2020, with support from National Science Foundation and in partnership with Universities Space Research Association and Amazon, he co-developed and co- taught a course on Quantum Integer Programming, which is freely available to students and researchers around the globe. Tayur's work on quantum computing has been covered by Ars Technica and Notices of the American Mathematical Society. In 2020, he was inducted into Pittsburgh Quantum Institute, as the first business school professor to join as a member. In a 2020 interview with Fortune, he endorsed the White House's proposed budget that doubled the Federal spending for artificial intelligence and quantum computing, citing the governments' crucial role in fueling basic research and that major tech firms such as Alphabet and Facebook ‚Äúare doing research in A.I. that benefits their business models.‚Äù Personal life Tayur was born in Madras (now Chennai) in India to a Kannada-speaking family. His father was in the Indian Administrative Service. Tayur is married to Gunjan Kedia, and they have two sons. Tayur and Kedia supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election. An avid movie watcher, Tayur also enjoys attending film festivals and recreating scenes from his favorite movies with an added twist. Philanthropy Education. In April 2014, Carnegie Mellon University received a $1 million gift from Tayur and his wife Gunjan Kedia, a Tepper alumna (MSIA ‚Äô94). This gift was to help construct the Tepper Quadrangle that will house the new Tepper School of Business building. In February 2016, Tayur launched a new Institute Chair at IIT Madras. Film. Tayur's charitable foundation, RAGS Family Foundation, was created to support various documentaries. The film Journey to Normal, featured by The Shriver Report, profiles several female veterans, including Christine Mau, who became the first woman to fly an F-35 Fighter Jet. The foundation also supports Silk Screen Asian American Film Festival, one of the largest Asian film festivals in the U.S., including providing the funding for the annual People's Choice Award. Through SmartOps in 2010 and the RAGS Foundation in 2013, Tayur supported The American Revolution, a feature-length documentary film. In 2018, he became an Executive Producer of the film. In 2019, it won Best Documentary Feature at DC Independent Film Festival, was the Centerpiece Documentary at the Boston Independent Film Festival and an Official Selection at Conquest Film Festival and Woods Hole Film Festival. Tayur has also been a member of the Leadership Donor Group at the Brattle Film Foundation and a member of the advisory board of TrueSpark, a non-profit seeking to engage at-risk middle school youth using motion pictures. In 2019, he became a co-Executive Producer for an updated version of the documentary The Shot Felt ‚ÄòRound the World (2010). In an interview with Variety about the lack of diversity in Disney's C-suite, Tayur advocated for a systematic approach: ‚ÄúEven if there are many talented or capable people, it takes time to sift through and make sure there is some kind of a process, and this is not done haphazardly... Frankly, it's not enough to put a few people in the C-suite. You don't want to give the impression that it's window dressing.‚Äù Public Television. Tayur served on the Board of Overseers and was a Ralph Lowell Society member of WGBH, in which capacity he helped bring organ donation topics to wide public awareness through the PBS- OZY collaboration late-night TV show, Point Taken.

The flight was operated with a Boeing 727 cargo aircraft. On 2 June 2012, the aircraft crashed on landing at Kotoka International Airport, killing twelve people on the ground. The aircraft overran the runway, broke through the airport perimeter fence, and struck a minibus on a roadway. All four crew members on the plane survived, but all 10 aboard the minibus were killed. It was the deadliest accident in Ghanaian aviation history. Flight Allied Air Flight 111 was a flight from Lagos Murtala Muhammed Airport to Kotoka International Airport with 4 crew members aboard. It took off from Lagos at 19:04 local time and was cleared to flight level 240. The flight operated under instrument flight rules (IFR). Weather was reported to be inclement, with turbulence reportedly present. As it was approaching Accra, the flight crew was told to descend to 2000', and then ordered to climb to 3000' due to high ground. On approach to Accra, the captain decided to fly an instrument landing system (ILS) approach. However, he later disconnected the autopilot and decided to fly manually. During landing, the aircraft encountered instrument meteorological conditions (IMS), with rain and zero visibility. The landing became unstable, and the aircraft touched down at a speed of 167 knots. Thrust reversers and normal braking were deployed, but proved ineffective. The nose gear remained in the air, and did not touch ground until the aircraft flew into the perimeter fence. The aircraft overran the runway and impacted the field's threshold lights and approach lights. It then destroyed the ILS localizer, the debris from which struck a passing taxi cab, causing an injury to its occupant. The aircraft then entered crowded Giffard Road, and crushed a minibus with 10 people on board. All aboard were killed. The plane then uprooted a tree, and stopped in an open area near El-Wak Stadium. All 4 crew members survived the accident with minor injuries.  Investigation  Investigation by the Ghanaian government's accident investigation commission concluded that the cause of the crash was pilot error. The pilot landed long- 4000' from the threshold of Runway 03. The remaining runway distance was insufficient to allow the plane to come to a stop. The investigation stated that both pilots might have been fixated on landing immediately, regardless of the poor conditions. The flight crew also did not deploy the speed brake, contributing to the aircraft overrunning the runway.

The Baldin Collection is a group of 364 masterpieces removed from Germany to the Soviet Union by Soviet Army officer Victor Baldin at the end of World War II. The ensemble consists of 362 drawings and 2 paintings by D√ºrer, van Gogh, Manet, Rembrandt, Rubens, Titian and other famous artists. Historically part of the collection at the Kunsthalle Bremen, the Baldin group came from a much larger cache of artworks stored by the Germans in a Brandenburg castle to protect it from air raids. In 1945 the castle was occupied by the Red Army and the storage vaults were looted, mainly by Russian soldiers but also by the local German population. The works Baldin took were then hidden at a Soviet Research Institute for many years. In 1991 the collection was moved to the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg where its existence was revealed to the world in 1992. It remains there today. Since then the Baldin Collection has been regarded as looted art and is the subject of fierce debate among experts, between Germany and Russia, and among politicians inside Russia itself. While Victor Baldin did steal the works, he is also credited with having saved them from destruction. For decades he appealed to senior officials, including Soviet leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev, to get them returned to Germany. In 1989 Baldin even traveled to Bremen, West Germany, to reveal the existence of the secret collection to the Kunsthalle. In the 1990s the government of Boris Yeltsin finally agreed to return the works, but subsequent Russian governments have blocked such plans.

History = Kunsthalle Bremen Collection  Kunsthalle in Bremen, Germany At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Bremen Art Museum (German: Kunsthalle Bremen) was closed and its priceless paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture were stored in the basement. Bremen, an important manufacturing center, became an early target for Allied strategic bombing. On the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six gallery rooms of the museum. It also burned a version of Emanuel Leutze's famous painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, which because of its size could not be moved. After this damage, the Kunsthalle collections were moved to more secure storage in various bank vaults underneath Bremen. In 1943, as bombing intensified, Bremen's mayor decreed that the museum's collections be moved to safety outside the city. The collection was divided up between four castles in Germany. A set of 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and 3000 prints were moved to Schloss Karnzow, the hunting lodge of Count von K√∂nigsmarck, near the small town of Kyritz north of Berlin in the Province of Brandenburg.Kunsthalle Bremen: Geschichte 1914‚Äì1945 online retrieved 3 June 2012.

The St. Petersburg Times Issue 855 (23) 28 March 2003 Baldin became determined to save what he could. He later said \\"I started in on the beautiful things, then I saw it was all beautiful.\\" He took drawings away from soldiers by force, by deception and in exchange for personal items. In one case, it took him three days to obtain a drawing of Christ's head by Albrecht D√ºrer from another officer. Baldin managed to coax the officer into exchanging it for his chrome boots. Of the thousands of works stored in the cellar, Baldin managed to save just 362 drawings and 2 paintings. Among them was the only known pen and ink study by van Gogh of his famous 1889 painting, The Starry Night As the Soviet Army withdrew, the cellars were left open and what little remained of the collection was lost to local looters and the weather. Baldin's actions and motives are still debated today. He did indeed cut the drawings from their mounts, put them into a suitcase, carry them to Russia and hide them in his apartment. However, while at the castle Baldin also wrote down descriptions of every work he saw, copied the German signatures and labels, and later carefully documented their provenance. He also begged for an official military transport so the collection could be handled more securely, but none were available, and his request was denied.Robert Hughes, Constance Richards, Rhea Schoenthal: \\"Spoils of War\\": Time Magazine, 3 April 1995 abstract online retrieved 2 June 2012 As a result, it is generally agreed that Baldin's efforts rescued priceless masterpieces from outright destruction. In addition, because of his specialized art knowledge, what would become known as the \\"Baldin Collection\\" became the most important part of the Kunsthalle collection remaining from Schloss Karnzow. In contrast to Baldin's efforts, works looted by Baldin's comrades from Karnzow have been found as far afield as Azerbaijan and in varying states of decay. In the late 1990s eight disputed drawings, including the world-famous Frauenbad (\\"Women's Bathhouse\\") by Albrecht D√ºrer, were seized by United States Customs in an incident of black market trading.Jo Ann Lewis, \\"Duerer, Drawing a Hot Bath\\" in: The Washington Post, 26 October 1997, at G9Constance Lowenthal, U.S. Customs Recovers Old Masters Drawings, IFAR Report, Oct. 1997, at 4 Today over 1,500 items from the Kunsthalle collection that were stored at Karnzow remain missing.  Postwar period, 1946‚Äì1990  After their return home, some of the officers who had participated in the looting at Karnzow donated their pieces to museums around the Soviet Union. In 1948 Baldin deposited his at the A. V. Shchusev State Scientific Research Museum of Architecture in Moscow, where the masterpieces became a Soviet state secret. Baldin worked as an art restorer at the museum and eventually became its general director in 1963, a post he held for 25 years. Baldin then tried for decades to give the stolen art back to Germany. He took the courageous steps of writing to Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev in 1973, to the chief ideologist of the Communist Party Yegor Ligachev in 1987, and many other Soviet political and cultural officials including Mikhail Suslov, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Raisa Gorbachev ‚Äì all to no avail. In 1989, during the period of increased transparency in the Soviet Union known as perestroika, Baldin took another unprecedented step. He traveled to Bremen, West Germany, and met with the director of the Kunsthalle, Dr Siegfried Salzmann. The director was shocked to learn that important parts of the long lost collection had survived. With hands shaking, he read the list of the missing masterpieces that Baldin had prepared years before. Baldin had put pencil marks next to those works he had personally rescued. He has since been called the \\"hero of the story.\\"  Post-Soviet period, 1991‚Äì2000  In 1991, Baldin wrote to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and finally received his first reply, in which the president agreed it would be politically correct to return the works to Germany. However, that same year nationalist elements in the Russian government hurriedly transferred the collection to the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in a cover-up attempt. As of 2012 it is still unclear if one of the most famous works in the collection, Cypresses in Starry Night (1889) by Van Gogh, is at the Hermitage or remains in Moscow. In legal proceedings and political debates during the following years it appeared that collection might return to its rightful owner.Jo Ann Lewis. \\"World War II German Art Hoard To Be Returned by Soviets; 360 Master Drawings Taken for Safekeeping\\" in: The Washington Post. 16 August 1990. In 2000, a group of 101 pieces from another part of Baldin's brigade, including Albrecht Duerers' 1494 watercolor View of a Rock Castle by a River, were returned to the Kunsthalle by Russia. This was followed by the simultaneous return of two artifacts of the Amber Room, bought and financed by a Bremen businessman to speed up the process.Peter Finn: \\"Bremen Basks In Return of Art Looted by Soviet Army\\" in: The Washington Post. 24 November 2000, A Section Anatoly Vilkov, from the Russian ministry of culture, stated that \\"Russia has no right to keep the Baldin collection.

Gubenko had been one of those involved in the 1991 transfer of the art to the Hermitage to hide it. The State Duma, which included Gubenko as a member, passed a non-binding resolution on 12 March 2003 asking President Vladimir Putin to prevent the Culture Ministry from returning the Baldin Collection.\\"Duma Calls for Go-Slow Approach on Trophy Art\\" Radio Free Europe Newsline 13 March 2003. Russian Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy opposed these moves to keep the collection in Russia; he regarded it as illegal loot based on a 1998 law that protected only those artworks from World War II taken by official Soviet trophy brigades and not private citizens. In 2003 he confirmed an order by the Russian General Prosecutor confirming a resolution of the Hanse Supreme court, which had decided the entire 364 remaining items were the official property of the Bremen Kunsthalle.\\"Russian Minister of Culture: Return of 'Baldin Collection' to Germany is Legally Relevant\\". Pravda. 7 April 2003. Shvydkoy and the German Minister of Culture Christina Weiss even signed an agreement that 20 pieces of the Baldin ensemble could remain in Russia.\\"Die Liste beginnt mit D√ºrer\\". Die Welt. 22 March 2003 retrieved 3 June 2012. Shvydkoy later received an official reprimand and was threatened by deputy prosecutor Vladimir Kolsenikov with criminal charges if he attempted to return the rest of the collection to Germany. In 2005 Aleksandr Sergeyevich Sokolov, Russia's new Culture Minister, then contradicted previous promises and stated that he opposed the return of the Baldin collection to Germany. As of 2010, it appeared that the collection would not be returning to Germany any time soon.  Legacy  According to a 2005 interview with Baldin's widow Julia Siwakowa, it was always his wish that the looted art be returned to the Kunsthalle. Baldin's last will stated: \\"The collection belongs to humankind, not only Germany, and as the collection was located at the Kunsthalle Bremen, it must be returned to this place.\\" The history of Victor Baldin, the stolen paintings and their odyssey is featured in the 2007 book Victor Baldin ‚Äì The Man with the Suitcase/Victor Baldin ‚Äì Der Mann mit dem Koffer.

After 1779 they were mostly absorbed by the North West Company. The name was first used by the Hudson's Bay Company to refer to French coureurs des bois, who travelled inland to trade with the Indians in their villages and camps. This was in contrast to the HBC policy of building posts on Hudson Bay, to where the Indians would bring furs to trade with them. The pedlars were important for three reasons: they helped transfer woodland skills from French-Canadians to the English- speakers who dominated the trade in the nineteenth century. Although English and Scots men had the capital to become traders for the HBC, most of the voyageurs, guides, and interpreters were French-Canadian or M√©tis people. They helped transfer knowledge of the country from the Indigenous peoples. Second, the pedlar competition forced the HBC to build posts inland. After 1821, the HBC monopoly became an informal government for western Canada. It is credited with contributing to the confederation of western and eastern Canada. Third, the pedlars opened up much of the country west of Lake Winnipeg. By the time the Canadian trade approached the Rocky Mountains, most pedlars had been absorbed into the North West Company.  Arrivals  This gives the first dates some of the major English-speaking fur traders arrived in Canada. Note the concentration near the ends of the two wars. 1759: Quebec falls, William Grant (seigneur) (Scotland) 1760: Montreal falls, Richard Dobie (Scotland) George McBeath (Scotland) 1761: Alexander Henry the elder (New Jersey) 1763: Benjamin Frobisher and Joseph Frobisher (England) 1765: Peter Pond (Connecticut) 1766: James McGill (Scotland) 1767: Peter Pangman (New Jersey) 1769:Simon McTavish (Scotland) 1774: Nicholas Montour (New York), John Finlay (fur trader) (Canada) 1783: Angus Bethune (fur trader) (Canada) 1783?: Alexander MacKay (fur trader) (New York) 1784: Simon Fraser (explorer) (New York) David Thompson (explorer) (London) William McGillivray (Scotland)1785: Francis Badgley (merchant) (London) 1786: Angus Shaw (Scotland) 1788: Peter Fidler (explorer) (England) 1790: Peter Skene Ogden (Quebec) 1799: Daniel Williams Harmon (Vermont)  Re-establishment of the fur trade and westward expansion =French trade destroyed During the French and Indian War, French officers were withdrawn to Quebec, trade goods became scarce, and by 1760 all the French forts on the Saskatchewan were closed. Some French colonists remained in the upper country and carried on trade as best they could. Some, like Louis Primeau gave up and joined the Hudson's Bay Company. After the British conquest of New France, the Royal Proclamation of 1763 attempted to regulate the fur trade, but there was no practical way to control the western traders. In 1768 control of Indian trade was shifted to the individual colonies and thus to the Governor of Quebec. Trade re- established Montreal fell in 1760. In 1761 William Grant (fur trader) made a deal with a French-Canadian to carry goods to Michilimackinac. In the same year Alexander Henry the elder carried goods from Albany, New York to Michilimackinac. In 1763 he was caught up in Pontiac's Rebellion and spent a year as a captive. In 1765 William Howard, in command of Michilimackinac, gave Henry a monopoly on the Lake Superior trade. French-Canadians who had remained in the interior, such as Blondeau and Fran√ßois le Blanc, continued to come and go. The first (unnamed) Englishman west of the lakes had his canoes plundered on Rainy Lake in 1765 and 1766, but he reached Lake Winnipeg in 1767. By 1767 the western trade seems to have been re-established. In that year 100 canoes traveled from Grand Portage to Michilimackinac where Robert Rogers (soldier) was in charge. The returns for that year show mostly French traders backed by English capitalists, along with a few English. They were trading in such places as Fort Dauphin (Manitoba) and Fort La Reine. In 1768 James Finlay was at Nipawin, Saskatchewan and in 1770 B&T; Frobisher were on Cedar Lake. West up the Saskatchewan In 1773/74 Louis Primeau and Joseph Frobisher wintered on Cumberland Lake. In 1774 Samuel Hearne built Cumberland House, Saskatchewan, the \\"first\\" interior post of the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1775 there were a number of pedlars upriver on the lower Saskatchewan near the old Fort de la Corne. Some appeared on Cumberland Lake, including Peter Pangman, the Frobishers, and Alexander Henry the elder. In 1776 the pedlars built Fort Sturgeon, the first post on the North Saskatchewan. In 1778 the pedlars built a post called Middle Settlement, upriver near Silver Grove(). Beyond the \\"elbow\\", they had a place called \\"Pidgeon's House\\" near Ruddell, Saskatchewan, and another called \\"Upper Settlement\\", nine miles downriver from Battleford, Saskatchewan. (In 1780 an Indian was killed at the Upper Settlement by being given an overdose of laudanum. The Indians captured the fort but allowed the traders to leave.) In 1779 the North West Company was established. Around 1780 a major smallpox epidemic struck the middle Saskatchewan and resulted in the deaths of many of the native trappers, resulting in a large economic loss for the North West Company in 1782. In 1782 the French captured York Factory, Manitoba, which disrupted the HBC trade. In 1786 Pine Island Fort was built 40 miles east of the Alberta border. One of its founders was Donald McKay, who was still a \\"pedlar\\" independent of the North West Company. For subsequent history see Saskatchewan River fur trade. Northwest to Lake Athabasca In the spring of 1775 Primeau and Joseph Frobisher went north from Cumberland Lake to Frog Portage, where they intercepted a large number of furs destined for Hudson Bay. In the winter of 1776/77, Peter Pond and Thomas Frobisher were on Lac √éle-√†-la-Crosse. In 1778 Pond crossed the Methye Portage and wintered about 40 miles below Lake Athabasca. In 1781 the HBC decided to enter the Athabasca trade.

Early life  Dominique de Roux was born in a Languedoc noble family that was close to monarchist circles (his grandfather, Marie de Roux, was the lawyer of Charles Maurras and Action Fran√ßaise). While deeply attached to his Charente land, Dominique de Roux showed an early independence and the desire to devote himself to literature. In 1960 he married Jacqueline Brusset, daughter of Gaullist deputy Max Brusset. Their son Pierre-Guillaume Roux was born in 1963 and later became a publisher.  Career  In the late 1950s de Roux created several language courses in Germany, Spain and England. Upon his return to France, he founded with several friends (including his brother Xavier de Roux, his sister Marie-Helene de Roux and Jean Thibaudeau) the mimeographed bulletin L'Herne, where he published his \\"Confidences to Guillaume\\", a chronicle of lyrical cynicism addressed to his geranium. He served in the French military. In 1960 he published his first novel, Mademoiselle Anicet, and redeveloped his review in the final form of the Cahiers de l'Herne, a collection of monographs devoted to ignored or cursed literary figures, including articles, documents and unpublished texts. After volumes on Ren√©-Guy Cadou (1961) and Georges Bernanos (1962), he penned books about Borges, Louis-Ferdinand Celine, Ezra Pound, Witold Gombrowicz and Pierre Jean Jouve. He directed books devoted to Burroughs, P√©lieu, Henri Michaux, Ungaretti, Louis Massignon, Lewis Carroll, H. P. Lovecraft, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Julien Gracq, Dostoyevsky, Karl Kraus, Gustav Meyrink, Thomas Mann, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, Arthur Koestler and Raymond Abellio, who imposed L'Herne on the French literary scene. In 1966, the publication of his essay La Mort de L.-F. C√©lineC√©line au bout de la nuit ‚Äì Entretien avec Dominique de Roux inaugurated the publishing house that he co-founded with Christian Bourgois,Dominique de Roux. Christian Bourgois √©diteur named after the latter. Meanwhile, L'Herne added publishing to its activities. At thirty, de Roux became a prominent figure of French literature, omnipresent and rough in his polemics, especially against the Tel Quel group. After listening to poets and writers of the beat generation (especially Claude P√©lieu, Allen Ginsberg and Bob Kaufman) and meeting with Gombrowicz,Dominque de Roux i Witold Gombrowicz - in Polish to whom he devoted an essay and a book of interviews, he revealed the possibility to leave Paris. Two traumatic events happened: the censorship of his collection of aphorisms Imm√©diatement (1971) at the request of Roland Barthes (called a \\"shepherdess\\") and Maurice Genevoix (presented as a \\"writer for field mice\\") and the takeover of L'Herne by Constantin Tacou in favor of financial maneuvers later in 1973. Dominique de Roux began a life of wandering and settled briefly in Lisbon and then in Geneva. Under these conditions he started his new magazine Exil and launched a new book series, Dossiers H, in √âditions L'√Çge d'Homme. He published pamphlets and devoted considerable to journalism and television, working as a correspondent in the Portuguese world at the times of implosion and war in its colonies (Guinea-Bissau, Angola, Mozambique). De Roux networked in the lusophone world, primarily serving the SDECE and because of his adherence to a \\"political transcendentalism\\" inspired by reading Raymond Abellio with whom his relations were intensifying at the time.French visions for a New Europe This is embodied in his utopia of a \\"Gaullist International\\" and in his idea that Portugal represented the assumption of a universal civilization. In April 1974, at the time of the Carnation Revolution, de Roux was the only French journalist present at Lisbon, and probably one of the foreigners with the most direct access to General Sp√≠nola. He devoted years to assist the Angolan opposition leader Jonas Savimbi to deal with international press and foreign ministries, as well as to conduct guerrilla warfare. This contribution gave impetus to his final works: Le Cinqui√®me Empire published two weeks before his sudden death at age 41, of a heart attack linked to Marfan syndrome, and the posthumous La Jeune fille au ballon rouge et Le Livre n√®gre.

Conceived by Adam Reed as the comedy's main protagonist, Sterling is voiced by H. Jon Benjamin. Reed was expected to play the role in the show's original pilot, but was recast because producers felt his voice-over was not suitable for the character's dialogue. Sterling debuted in the first episode of Archer, \\"Mole Hunt\\", on September 17, 2009. Inspired by James Bond, Sterling appears in early seasons of Archer as the narcissistic, womanizing secret agent of the International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS), a fictional New York-based intelligence service headed by his mother Malory (Jessica Walter). His narcissism, sharp sense of humor and complex relationships with his peers serve as important aspects of his character. Archer subsequent years see Sterling take on different occupations and personae as the show experiments with new ideas, character arcs and self- contained narratives. Archer characterization of Sterling, and Benjamin's performance of the character, have been well received by the media. Benjamin has received numerous accolades, including a Primetime Emmy nomination and an Annie Award nomination, for outstanding achievement in voice acting. Attributes=Background Sterling was born in Tangier as the only child of Malory Archer (Jessica Walter), the retired agent-turned-director of the New York-based International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS). The whereabouts of his biological father are unknown barring a fake identity conceived by Malory, though he briefly appears as a faceless figure in a dream sequence in the season four episode \\"Once Bitten\\", as Sterling hallucinates from a cobra bite. Sterling spent his youth at a boarding school, where he excelled at lacrosse. As a result, he was offered an athletic scholarship to Johns Hopkins University, but the offer falls through after Sterling is shot in the abdomen. Although not explicitly stated, a background photo in season two's \\"Placebo Effect\\" hints Sterling may have instead graduated from Georgetown University.See Season 2, Episode 9. Archer is depicted at the bottom of the staircase outside Lauinger Library in a graduation photo. Healy Hall is also shown in the background. Personality The comic efficacy of Sterling's personality lies in his narcissism and unremitting snark. The character is described as \\"rude, sexist, and a terrible boss\\" without a moment's regret. He frequently harasses his peers with caustic jokes, one- liners and over-the-top, elaborate voicemail pranks. Sterling is a full-blown alcoholic who uses his position to entice women into sex. He also can be highly irresponsible when tasked with demanding assignments, but is otherwise a productive field agent. Reed envisioned Sterling as \\"dickish as possible\\", albeit somewhat sympathetic character √† la James Bond. Sterling becomes an even more sympathetic personality as Archer evolves in later seasons, when revelations about his troubled past, fears, affection for animals, and a deep admiration of Burt Reynolds, among others, come to light. During the 6th and 7th season we see how severe trauma and important events, in the form of cancer, the death of his ex-fianc√© Katya Kazanova, the death of his possible father Nikolai Jakov, the birth of his daughter, and his relationship with his mother, have heavily influenced his moral compass and his sense of personal responsibility. Sterling has complex relationships with many of his coworkers. The turbulence between him and Malory stems from years of childhood neglect, resulting in interactions that are often \\"fraught, laden with [...] memories of unforgiven slights, and the needy fears that accompany codependence\\". These feelings are sometimes manifested by sexual tension, evidenced when Sterling at one point shouts his mother's name while having sex with longtime love interest Lana Kane (Aisha Tyler), and gets an erection from the thought of her dying but only a semi as the other half would miss her. Sterling's relationship with Lana is likewise tumultuous because of his infidelity and immature behavior. Yet she has a new found compassion for him when he becomes ill with cancer, and by the time their daughter is born, their relationship is such that Sterling is \\"willing to put his money [...] where other people's mouths are in order to protect his family.\\" Storylines Archer is introduced in the pilot episode \\"Mole Hunt\\", as a special agent for the intelligence agency International Secret Intelligence Service (ISIS). He attempts to make amends with a resistant ex-girlfriend, Lana Kane, who ended their relationship six months prior because of an affair. The situation is further exacerbated by Cyril Figgis, who is Lana's companion at the time. Concurrently, he had a brief relationship with secretary Cheryl Tunt. Lana's drive to get revenge on Archer for cheating on her is fairly evident throughout the initial half of the first season, even going as far as to shoot him on multiple occasions. Unbeknownst to Archer, Malory has been keeping in contact with Nikolai Jakov and Len Trexler, one of whom‚Äîdespite serving for rivaling agencies‚Äîcould possibly be his real father. By \\"Dial M for Mother\\", he becomes suspicious of Malory's sly tactics, which prompts her to affirm that the identity of Archer's biological father is unknown. Much of the second season of Archer is devoted to the character identifying his real father. Archer travels to Russia to find out whether Jakov is his biological father, only to be stranded and kidnapped by agents of the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB). Worried about her missing son, Malory sends nemesis Barry Dylan to rescue Archer from the KGB‚ÄîBarry is later severely injured after falling from grabbing onto Archer's legs for dear life. Although unsuccessful at finding out the DNA results, he meets Katya Kasanova, a former KGB spymaster looking to enter into ISIS. Eventually, the couple get married; however, the marriage is interrupted by Barry, who is now a cyborg revitalized by the KGB (in a parody of The Six Million Dollar Man). Following a growing disdain of Archer after previously destroying his femur and having anal sex with his (now ex-)fianc√©e, Barry attempts to murder him. Katya unsuccessfully attempts to kill Barry by jumping off of the roof of Archer's apartment building, sacrificing herself in the process. During the search for his father, Archer develops breast cancer after being exposed to high doses of radiation. Although the group thinks that he has entered into remission by the latter half of \\"Stage Two\\", the following episode concedes that the tumor has progressed into stage-two breast cancer. Treatment for the tumor (aside from the copious amounts of marijuana he was using) consisted of sucrose pills and Zima, according to an evaluation commenced by Dr. Algernop Krieger, causing Lana and Archer to tackle a local Irish gang that has been smuggling anticancer drugs in lieu of the sucrose pills and Zima solution. In the same episode, it is revealed that Archer filmed his massacre of the Irish gang and edited it into a movie called, \\"Terms Of Enrampagement\\". Distraught by his fianc√©e's death, Archer retreats to French Polynesia to recuperate from the frenetic pace of his occupation. Rip Riley, a former ISIS agent, is recruited by Malory to pursue him and return Archer to New York City. After a futile attempt, Lana and Ray Gillette are sent to rescue Archer and Riley, who have been kidnapped by pirates. Ultimately, the duo are captured by the pirates and put into a dungeon, where Riley, Noah (a doctoral candidate in anthropology who was enslaved by the pirates after they captured his research vessel), and Archer are being harbored. Malory prepares to administer a ransom for the group, but later declines to extort money to the assailants after being insulted by Archer. Now temporarily severed from ties with the International Security Intelligence Service, the group steals a helicopter and escapes from the pirate fortress. FBI agents shut down ISIS as it turns out it was not sanctioned by the U.S. government to perform acts of espionage whatsoever. Throughout the fifth season, Archer and the rest of ISIS are selling the ton of cocaine they have stored in order to make enough money for early retirements, which they fail throughout the season. In the season finale, Malory succeeds in having ISIS reinstated as an official agency by cutting an affiliation deal with the CIA. At the same time, it is revealed that Archer is the father of Lana Kane's newborn daughter, conceived through in vitro fertilization from semen stored when Archer was being treated for cancer. In season six, a reluctant Archer and his co-workers are reinstated as freelance agents working for the CIA on a trial basis. In the first episode, which takes place six weeks after the end of season five, Archer has been residing in Thailand because he was shocked that Lana used his sperm, but then he finally comes home after a mission in Borneo. For the rest of the season, Archer tries (and the most part failing) to be a part of his child's life and in episode eight goes with Lana to meet her parents, who, even though they don't think much of Archer, still consider him part of the family. In the finale, the CIA hires Archer and the others to save the life of a brilliant scientist by shrinking down and destroying a lethal blood clot in his brain. Even though they manage to destroy the blood clot, they ended up killing the doctor when they prematurely regrow while inside him, with the CIA disavowing them and leaving them with nothing. Archer convinces the group that they should start a detective agency in Los Angeles, setting up the events of season seven where they are subjected to the machinations of actress Veronica Deane. It eventually resulted with Archer being shot several times by Veronica in the season seven finale, later revealed to have survived but in a coma for three months. Season eight follows Archer in his coma-induced dream where he imagines himself as a Private Detective and all of his co-workers, friends and associates as characters in a 1940s-esque film noir setting known as \\"Dreamland\\". Season nine has Archer, remaining in a coma-induced dream, imagined as a co-pilot with Pam, who crash land onto the lush and mysterious Pacific island of Mitimotu. Season ten continues the coma-induced imagination themed setting, this time portraying Archer as the co-captain of the starship M/V Seamus in a \\"1970s vision of the future\\" reminiscent of Star Wars and Alien. He finally awakens from his coma at the conclusion of the season to find that three years have passed and now needs a cane to walk. Development=Conception After the cancellation of the television series Frisky Dingo in 2008, Reed took a year off from work and travelled to Europe and Morocco for leisure. He would often observe the general atmosphere of the environment around him. \\"I was in Europe and Morocco for most of the year,\\" Reed recalled, \\"bumming around with a backpack and a scruffy beard, and sitting in cafes writing in my journal, seeing all these wealthy people and beautiful women, walking around, looking all European. I kept thinking about this world that I wasn't invited to going on behind me in these gorgeous buildings. I was like, 'I know there's some awesome cocktail party on the roof of that building, and I am walking around with a Hot Pocket.' So I kept thinking about, y'know, James Bond would totally be at that party, and would not be eating this Hot Pocket.\\" Hoping to become innovative in the spy fiction genre, Reed continued his endeavors at home. He read all of the James Bond novels, which were given to him several years previously by an acquaintance. Reed quickly alluded to the misogynist nature of the covers of the novels, which he described as Pulp Fiction-esque covers of Bond \\"assaulting a woman somehow while playing cards\\". Although the Archer creator wanted the title character to embody an obtuse, yet sympathetic personality, he was still apprehensive on modeling it after James Bond until viewing GoldenEye (1995); in the film, Reed was immediately captivated by Judi Dench's portrayal of M‚Äîthe head of the Secret Intelligence Service. \\"I was spinning my wheels on that,\\" Reed remarked, \\"and then it clicked when I was watching the James Bond reboot with Judi Dench as M, and then I thought what if M was James Bond‚Äôs mother, and what a weird dynamic that would be, and what if they were both horrible people.\\" FX initially disapproved of Archer's bumbling demeanor, as similar endeavors have previously been done on multiple occasions. This made it especially difficult on Reed in writing the script for \\"Mole Hunt\\", the pilot episode of the series. \\"It was hard, if a guy‚Äôs really good looking and apparently rich and has a great apartment and has really great clothes and dates all the girls and could kick your face off, if he‚Äôs also the smartest guy in the room, you‚Äôre not going to root for him.\\" Indeed, he would often debate with the executives of FX on the character throughout the first season, but concerns later subsided after Reed asserted that Archer was merely overconfident, and not dumb. \\"He‚Äôs just supremely confident and thinks that nothing bad is ever going to happen to him, so in these dangerous situations where he‚Äôs being an idiot, he‚Äôs just being willfully obtuse to see what will happen.\\" All of the main characters on the program were modeled after a select group of local residents of Atlanta. The producers then had them dressed in period clothing. \\"We just grabbed people around here, and then it was just sort of a fluke that they ended up looking like, to some extent, their real- life counterparts.\\" Archer was designed after an electrician who, according to Adam Reed, was \\"exactly that handsome and also really nice\\". Casting Reed originally wanted to provide the voice of the character, but eventually recognized that his voice would stand out among other professional actors. H. Jon Benjamin‚Äîwhom Reed was familiar with from his work on various Adult Swim cartoons such as The Venture Bros. and Home Movies‚Äîwas approached by Reed for the role of Archer while Benjamin was visiting his parents in Tucson, Arizona. Benjamin was given a copy of the pilot script, and later recorded it at a Tucson studio the following week, relating, \\"So I think I just went in to this‚Äîit was in the back of this guy‚Äôs house or something. He had a makeshift studio. So it felt dirty, but I don‚Äôt think I read the script prior, didn‚Äôt get it. I just happen to be visiting my parents and it all happened, so I just went in and read and it worked out well for them, not for my parents.\\" Benjamin was contingent with the role, as he was apprehensive on imitating a spy. The Home Movies actor was a top prerogative for Reed in portraying the character because of his distinctive voice. \\"One of the reasons I think that you root for him, besides knowing that some of it isn‚Äôt his fault, he‚Äôs got this terrible mother and a terrible childhood, is Jon‚Äôs delivery. It‚Äôs so disarming that even the most conceited, hurtful, horrible things that Archer says, when Jon puts voice to them, they come across as not so bad.\\" Reception Benjamin's portrayal of Sterling Archer has attracted positive reviews from critics. The character of Archer and Benjamin's voicework has been well received by critics. Dan Kois of Slate ascribed the character's lovability to his impulsive and callow disposition. \\"He has the wardrobe, sex life, and armaments of an adult superspy, but the soul (and impulse control) of a child.\\" As Newsday writer Verne Gay affirmed, \\"Sterling Archer [...] is a suave if hard-bitten boozehound who, nonetheless, knows how to handle weaponry and women‚Äîsometimes.\\" James Poniewozik of Time defined Archer as the \\"bluff\\" and \\"lunkheaded\\" star of the series, while USA Today Whitney Matheson professed that the character is a callous, albeit attractive individual. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Tim Goodman attested that Benjamin's monotonous delivery of his lines was one of the highlights of the show. \\"Benjamin has a kind of laid-back, half-drunk, half-outraged banter that never fails to amuse,\\" professed the San Francisco Chronicle journalist. Poniewozik echoed similar sentiments, who avouched that the actor evinced Archer's arrogant predilection. To Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune, Benjamin delivered a unique inflection and attitude that she described was purely \\"Archer-ian\\". Critics have generally applauded the storylines that have involved the character. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix commented that the series shines when the writers \\"are able to straddle the line between Archer being an ignorant baby and a witty spy capable of being a hyper-competent badass\\", as palpable in the first part of the third season installment \\"Heart of Archness\\". Annotating on \\"The Man from Jupiter\\", Paste Ross Bonaime avouched that Burt Reynolds' character effectively shed light onto the issues that Archer faces, as well as demonstrate a more affectionate side of him. Benjamin has been nominated for two awards for his work as Sterling Archer on the television series. His performance in \\"Mole Hunt\\" resulted in the actor being nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance. Benjamin ultimately lost to actress Anne Hathaway for her performance in The Simpsons episode \\"Once Upon a Time in Springfield\\". Alongside fellow cast members Jessica Walter and Judy Greer, Benjamin was a candidate for an Annie Award in the category of Voice Acting in a Television Production‚Äîthe award was given to Jeff Bennett for his work in the Nickelodeon television series The Penguins of Madagascar.

Different mediums were being used with a variety of measurements, colors and display styles. Axles, like arteries, feeding the ease of legibility around which the exhibition revolves. Therefore the focal point of \\"Untitled\\" is the concept of meaning. Each artwork has its meaning however, even though they belong to different series or they were made in different mediums, create a bigger and much intense chunk of information.

After 23 years, the artist returned to the building where he completed his undergraduate studies. This time he tied the twin towers of the historical building together from inside. The project which changes and transforms depending upon the location was not displayed in a museum but this time in an academic institution. G√ºlan's The Great Conjugation' used approximately 1000 ties for this installation. All of the connected ties created a route tens of meters long and the line flowed through the all five floors of the building. The ties connected the twin towers of the building from the inside which was built in 1906. During the exhibition G√ºlan invited the viewers to bring their ties and add them to the installation to generate a second level of participation. G√ºlan's work of art is not descriptive, it does not involve just one explanation. Both the objects that are used and the space-time relationship between them give a range of meaning to the piece. What G√ºlan tries to do is to constitute new semantic connections and summon new connotations by using the association of ideas. While he is doing that he claims the role of 'playmaker' and tries to be almost out of the picture. Even if the method is referring to Nicolas Bourriaud's concept of relational aesthetics, the soft sculpture that came to life is more plastic and political among its contemporaries. The ties used in the project have different colors, designs, brands and they were made in different countries. They were gathered from hundreds of domestic and abroad donators. The ties some of which are silk, nylon and wool conjugate and become a whole. The same ties were exhibited and greatly appreciated by viewers in The Thessaloniki State Museum of Contemporary Art and Ankara Contemporary Art Center in 2013.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 2003. At the time of its nomination it contained 43 resources, which included 28 contributing buildings, two contributing sites, 10 non-contributing buildings, one non-contributing site, one non-contributing structures, and on non-contributing object. with The town of Hampton was laid out by H.P. Allen, who was the county surveyor, in June 1856. The original plat was eight blocks by eight blocks in the shape of an ‚ÄúL‚Äù. Near the center of the ‚ÄúL‚Äù was the two-block, or double, square. While many county seats in Iowa have a courthouse square, the double square is a rarity. Four double squares were platted in Iowa, but only those in Hampton and Sidney survived their early period of development. Estherville's square was platted as a four- block square, but its development created a double square instead. Hampton has the only symmetrical double square plan in the state. The double square exemplifies the two primary functions of a public square, both commercial and public development. The district's period of significance is from 1856, when it was of platted, to 1935 when the last public building was constructed. Building usage is largely commercial with a few public/government buildings, and the Congregational Church. The buildings are largely two stories tall and constructed of brick in the styles that were popular at the time. Many of the commercial blocks are Italianate in design.

Origins  The County Road Cutters were, at their peak throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, one of the largest hooligan firms in England. Their name derives from County Road, the long road leading up to Everton's home ground, Goodison Park, in Walton, Liverpool, and also from the firm's use of Stanley knives in fights with other hooligan firms.  History and rivalries  Members of the Cutters are known to be one of the first firms to adopt casual clothing and designer garments in the 1970s along with hooligan supporters of local rivals Liverpool F.C.. The Country Road Cutters had a strong rivalry with the Sunderland A.F.C. firm Seaburn Casuals. The Seaburn Casuals, in 1984, took over the Everton FC pub called The Blue House for several hours. Eventually, the County Road Cutters managed to win it back. The Seaburn Casuals tried to do it again in the mid 90s, but failed.Hooligans 2: The M-Z of Britain's Football Hooligan Gangs By Andy Nicholls, Nick Lowles, published in 2005 by Milo books Andy Nicholls, a former 'general' in the County Road Cutters throughout the 1980s and 1990s, who was branded a category C football hooligan by the National Football Intelligence Unit (NFIU), the highest NFIU rating, claims that the Cutters had strong rivalries with hooligan firms of the two Manchester teams, Manchester United F.C. and Manchester City F.C., the Sunderland firm Seaburn Casuals, as well as with the Chelsea Headhunters, a firm associated with Chelsea F.C., and the Millwall Bushwackers, a firm associated with Millwall F.C..

Hooligan supporters of the two teams clashed outside Goodison Park after the game, in which Everton triumphed 1-0 thanks to a Duncan Ferguson headed goal. The fight between the supporters is known as 'The Battle of Everton Valley', and is widely thought to be the worst incident of football related violence Merseyside has ever seen. Around 100 United fans were left bloodied and injured, and within hooligan circles, the 'battle' is widely regarded as a 'win' for the County Road Cutters. Some sources claim that Liverpool FC hooligans joined forces with the Cutters to battle against the Red Army. According to Manchester United hooligan Colin Blaney in his book 'Undesirables', the Cutters have also come to blows with Manchester United's Red Army firm over disputes stemming from both firms' involvement in illegal ticket touting at pop concerts.

The Davis Square Tiles Project. Accessed October 10, 2010 The cost of this particular sculpture was $30,000. Gloves was not the first theme that Harries considered for her subterranean artwork. Initially her concept revolved around bronze tree roots appearing to come through the walls and into the stations. This idea was turned down by the architects of Porter Station for bringing attention to the fact that the station is deep underground. Harries stated, \\"The whole philosophy of subway stations, it turns out, is to make them seem as un-underground as possible,\\" something the tree roots idea would be the exact opposite of. The next theme she considered was to create a flock of sheep-shaped turnstiles. This concept fell to the wayside as the snow from a blizzard in Boston began to melt. Harries began to find lost gloves emerging from the snow. She said that, \\"They were wet, compacted, squashed‚Äîreally beautiful!\\" These lost items gave her the inspiration for her new sculptural theme, gloves.

The group describes itself as being a 30-year-old institution entirely composed of paid professionals. This puts it on a tier above other non-BSO orchestras in Baltimore, such as the Soulful Symphony, Baltimore Choral Arts Society, Baltimore Philharmonia, Baltimore Chamber Orchestra, Peabody Institute ensembles and various academic orchestras. The unique nature of the group allows it to stage large orchestral/choral works at a level of quality only viable in-house for a few other institutions on the East Coast. It also puts the group in demand for collaborations, including a 2011 performance of Honegger's Joan of Arc which, with more than 600 participants, was so massive as to require three of the groups mentioned above. Structure As of 2011, the group's orchestra added a second role, playing at least one show in the pit of Lyric Opera Baltimore. This partnership is likely to continue on some level, as the Baltimore Sun's classical music critic was not impressed by the performance of the more- expensive BSO in the Lyric's pit. The Lyric performance featuring the CAB orchestra, on the other hand, received a generally positive review for musicality from the same critic. The group's director, Edward Polochik, has experience with the Peabody Institute, Lincoln's Symphony Orchestra and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Frequent venues for the group over the years have included Friedberg Hall, Owings Mills' Gordon Center and the Baltimore Lyric Opera House. The group is governed by a 10-member board of directors and, according to The Baltimore Sun, has a budget of roughly $400,000 per year. Critical response Over the decades, critics have had good and bad things to say about the group, with one typical example being a Baltimore City Paper writer who, in 2000, said Polochik's conducting was \\"expressive,\\" even as he chastised the director's programming, noting that guitar soloist James Hontz \\"did his technical best but didn't communicate excitement, which, when playing technically challenging music composed of weak tunes, doesn't keep an audience awake.\\" Indeed, one of the hallmarks of the group is its willingness as a secondary orchestra to program less-known works: As an example, in 2005, while active as resident artists at Baltimore's Cathedral of Mary Our Queen, the group performed a show including Poulenc's 1938 Concerto for Organ, Strings, and Timpani in G Minor, followed by Haydn's \\"Lord Nelson\\" Mass‚Äîboth works that would not frequently make it onto the programs of many large cities' \\"primary\\" orchestras.

He is staying at a backwoods Mississippi motel while working on a drilling rig on the Atchafalaya River, when he meets \\"Virginia\\", a call girl whom he hires for a night.

Circumstances lead the couple, after trying to get away from each other, back together. The two duke it out to get Tim's money, which they have sewn into the panels of a pink girdle. They settle into a love/hate relationship when Tim realizes that she might be the perfect person to help him pull off a heist. \\"The novel unfolds from here as the sort of love story in which either lover might turn in or murder the other at any moment until its last desperate pages.\\" The two wind up in Colorado, where Tim discovers a part of Virginia's past and what she is running from in fleeing New York. He lets her in on his plans and they plot to rob an armored truck. They pretend to be a married couple and buy a house in a suburban part of Denver. Tim gets a job at a factory as a steel cutter. He does his homework on his off time, at a bank, watching the armored truck that rolls in and out of there. One night Tim and Virginia go to an old haunt of hers, where an old friend Mamie, calls her \\"Jennie\\" and talks about how she was a debutante and came from a good family. After spending weeks waiting for the right opportunity, the couple practice the heist. Tim has studied the armored truck and knows its schedule: the stops it makes, how long the driver and guard take at each location, and when the truck is most vulnerable to robbery. He eventually steals the truck, killing one of the guards who had sat in back with the money. He takes off while the driver is inside the building and finds Virginia. While she drives, he counts the haul, $89,000. They reach Cripple Creek, a secluded place in the woods where they had previously stayed. They push the armored truck and its trailer into a mine shaft to hide them. Tim reveals that his account is his confession, as he's writing it in his prison cell. He recounts that he and Virginia went to New Orleans where they meet Eddie Arceneaux and his sister, Loralee, a couple of young adults from a wealthy family. Tim finds that he and Virginia are becoming the snobbish, rich people types who are buying freely. He believes that Virginia is becoming too spoiled by their new wealth. : After they get the money, nothing goes as they had planned. Tim runs into former neighbors from his hometown who call him \\"Kenneth McLure\\". Eddie says that he is going to seduce Virginia and they will run away together. His sister Loralee tries to seduce Tim; when he returns to his room and finds it empty, he thinks Virginia has gone off with Eddie. Virginia returns alone and Tim forces her to leave New Orleans. They make their way to the Gulf of Mexico and end up in Tim's hometown of Masonville, Mississippi. He wants to check out the house of Nona Hickman, an old girlfriend, when they are stopped suddenly by a cop. They make a run for it, and start a police chase that ends in Virginia killing the first cop and Tim getting out of the car. She panics and drives off, leaving Tim with the second cop. Tim in defense, shoots him and makes a break for it. He is caught and badly beaten, burned with cigars, and thrown in jail. The cops had thought they were suspects in a grocery store robbing. They question him but he refuses to reveal information about Virginia. Virginia is also caught and thrown in jail. They form a story together to blame another person for the shootings but they escape the jail and fly to Denver. In Denver, they stay at the hotel in the secluded part where the old mine shaft is. They blend in with the tourists, going skiing and finally renting a house out there. Virginia starts to obsess about death and being in the electric chair. One day, they go out skiing and for a picnic near the mine shaft. They both feel drawn to it, tempted to look inside. : They inch their way towards the open shaft and finally look into the 600-foot drop. Feeling relieved, they start to dance around. Virginia suddenly slips and falls into the shaft opening but lands on an unstable rubble landing 40 feet down. Tim panics and goes back to the hotel to find rope, where he runs into his \\"old FBI friend\\", Clell Dooley, who had prosecuted him. Clell notices Tim when he runs out the door to go back to Virginia. When Clell and four or five other men find Tim, he is sitting near the mine shaft, thinking about Virginia. Tim had seen that 40 or so feet down in the mine shaft, there was \\"a lump\\", like a rock sticking out and nothing else. Tim asks the men if they have seen Virginia; they carry him off, presumably to jail. CharactersReviews Ed Gorman wrote \\"Chaze is known in pulp circles for his flawless novel Black Wings Has My Angel, which many people feel is the single best novel Gold Medal published during its heyday.\\" In his introduction to the new 2016 edition, screenwriter Barry Gifford wrote, \\"nothing else Chaze wrote came anywhere close to what he had accomplished on all levels in Black Wings.\\" Bill Pronzini wrote that \\"Black Wings Has My Angel is a book that must be experienced, not read quickly for casual entertainment. It makes demands on the reader, as any piece of quality fiction does, and those demands deliver hammerblows where other noir novels provide light raps.\\" Film adaptation Chaze sold the film rights to French director Jean-Pierre Mocky. Screenwriter Barry Gifford described his 1990 adaptation as \\"not very good.\\" In the early 21st century, director Alfonso Pineda Ulloa and producer and co-writer Christopher Peditto spent more than a decade working to obtain the rights to the novel. Peditto and fellow screenwriter Barry Gifford completed a screenplay for the film in 2012, and it was set to star Tom Hiddleston as Tim Sunblade, Anna Paquin as Virginia, and Elijah Wood as Eddie Arceneaux. Filming was scheduled to start in September 2012, with a projected release date in late 2013. But shooting was put oh hold after Paquin gave birth to twins and wanted to take time with them. Filming for the movie has yet to be announced but is still in pre-production. Editions This novel was reprinted in other editions: as One for My Money (1962), Berkley.

History Formed in 1991, Deranged is a very peculiar band in the Swedish scene: unlike bands such as Grave, Entombed and Dismember, Deranged does not have the Swedish sound and plays a very fast and technical deathgrind with several groove influences. Drawing inspirations from Cannibal Corpse, Carcass, Morbid Angel, Suffocation and Napalm Death, the band is better associated with U.S death metal. The band have released the singles The Confessions of a Necrophile -title directly extracted of the movie- (1992) and Upon the Medical Slab (1994), the EP's The Confessions Continue (1993), Architects of Perversions (1994) and Sculpture of the Dead (1996) and the albums Rated X (1995), High on Blood (1998), III (2000), Deranged (2001), Plainfield Cemetery (2002), Obscenities in B-Flat (2006), The Redlight Murder Case (2008) and Cut, Carve, Rip, Serve (2011). Also, in 2001 the band did a split with Abscess Throughout the years, the band suffered several drastic changes in the line-up and in November 2007, the original members were Rikard Werm√©n (drums) and Axel Johansson (guitar). In March 2008, Werm√©n left the band, which disbanded in July after several problems between Axelsson and Martin Sch√∂nherr. The band was resurrected in the summer of 2009, with Werm√©n and Sch√∂nherr on their original duties, but with Thomas Ahlgren (former in the bass) on guitar because Axelsson not was there, and with Andreas Johansson on bass. After some festival gigs across Europe and a short Russian tour, the band returned to Berno Studio in February 2011, to record the \\"come-back\\" album Cut Carve Rip Serve, which was released via the U.S label Sevared Records. In August 2011, Sch√∂nherr left the band, leaving Ahlgren to handle the vocals for a second Russian tour and the Rock In Solo festival in Indonesia. The following year, the band played in their first national show after 2007; also, the band announced the arrival of a new vocalist, Anders Johansson (ex- Vomitous).

They first appear in Green Lantern #4. Fictional character biography Native to the planet Krolotea in Space Sector 2812, the Kroloteans who were also known as Gremlins were an insidious race who performed genetic experiments on subjects in a lawless as well as unethical attempt at creating a scientifically advanced race of super warriors to sell to the highest bidder. They had no compunctions on manipulating the evolution of other species as part of their experimentation's so long as it produced highly destructive \\"weapons\\" which they could sell to their clients. At some point, they began arriving on the planet Earth where they became known as Gremlins. They are responsible for the experiments done on Hector Hammond, Black Hand, and The Shark. Kroloteans are known to experiment on numerous species throughout the universe.Green Lantern' (vol. 4) #4 (October, 2005) Villain of Green Lantern The Green Lantern Venizz during her service managed to uncover a Krolotean concentration camp where she liberated its prisoners who were subjected to various experiments by the Gremlins. Among the many victims was a being known as Tagort whose body and strength were overgrown as a result of his captors experimentation's. They were notably allied with Evil Star who referred to them as his \\"Starlings\\" and were searching for the Black that was linked to the prophecy of the Blackest Night. The Gremlins later returned where they abducted a Human being and conducted experiments in artificial evolution on him which turned him into a Roswell Grey type of creature whereupon he was returned to Earth. Once there, he was killed when a truck ran him over by accident to which the individual stated that all he did was go out for a cigarette. Investigating the situation, Hal Jordan was contacted by the Belle Reve prison authority which informed him that Hector Hammond had information on the event. Going to the prison, Jordan bargained with Hammond who eventually revealed that he did not know the creatures names but they were responsible for transforming him as well as conducted numerous experiments over the years and that they had returned to keep watch over another experiment.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #5 (October, 2005) They also kept track on the movements of William Hand and abducted him whilst he was on an airplane. Once among them, they began experimenting on him and returned him to Earth with the intention of him fighting against Hal Jordan by giving him the ability to absorb the life force of living creatures which would regenerate his severed hand that he lost to Jordan when he was The Spectre. They also made a move on abducting Hector Hammond again. In the meantime, the Kroloteans had found another test subject in a Shark which they genetically engineered and evolved to the point it became a humanoid entity that began terrorizing the coast. This attracted the attention of Hal Jordan who struggled against the beast until the Gremlins arrived to take both subjects on board their ship for further testing. As the two are taken aboard the alien ship, the Kroloteans secured the Shark and were about to experiment on Hal Jordan when Hammond mentally woke him up. The Green Lantern than proceeded to trap the Gremlins in small cages whereupon he asked his power ring on who the aliens were to which it responded that the Kroloteans tampered with a planet's natural resources and accelerated its evolution.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #6 (October, 2005) Despite the aid of Black Hand, the Kroloteans were defeated and their plot thwarted and they were handed over Venizz and Tagort in order to bring the criminals to justice for their genetic atrocities.Green Lantern (vol. 4) #43 (September, 2009) Unknown to many, the Gremlins latest experiment on Hector Hammond had given further abilities to the evolved Human such as gaining the power of speech.Blackest Night (vol. 1) #1(September, 2009) Sinestro Corps At least one member of the species known as Gleen was selected as a member of the Sinestro Corps who was assigned to Space Sector 0312.

They are skilled in advanced science and genetic engineering. Using lower lifeforms as their test subjects, they have tampered with the evolutionary patterns of over a thousand species. In other media=Television * The Kroloteans appears in the Young Justice television series. They appear as major villains throughout the series. In this show, the Kroloteans are presented as a culture that revolves around theft. Their presence is first made known in the Episode \\"Happy New Year\\". The bounty hunter Lobo captures a Krolotean who had kidnapped and replaced Secretary- General Tseng, leading to the revelation that there were numerous Kroloteans disguised as humans on Earth. They appear to be extremely afraid of Blue Beetle, something that baffles the hero and his companions even when he stopped the Krolotean that was posing as Bibbo Bibbowski. This is eventually explained due to the fact that the Kroloteans and The Reach are fierce rivals. In the episode \\"Earthlings,\\" the heroes discover that the Kroloteans have been arriving on Earth via the use of stolen Zeta tubes from Rann. Superboy, Miss Martian, Beast Boy and Alanna successfully destroy one of the Zeta facilities before returning home.

It uses GPS to provide accurate and automated position data of storm spotters and chasers for coordination and reporting, which in turn provides ground truth to public servants engaged in the protection of life and property. The network is a combination of locally installed software for position and status reporting and web-based processing, mapping, and reporting. The original Spotter Network was developed by Tyler Allison. The current president of the organization is John Wetter. It became operational in April 2006 and quickly grew to over 100 spotters. Several National Weather Service (NWS) employees and other officials soon took an interest in the capabilities it brings to them to integrate ground truth provided by spotters into their operational responsibilities. Subsequent versions of the network expanded the coordinator and reporting capabilities, and NWS eSpotter integration was completed in early September 2006. Spotters must pass an online test of storm structure and basic meteorology in order to use the system. All reports are also reviewed for quality control purposes. Contact information is provided by users and can be controlled to reach the all users (the general public) or selectively to reach emergency managers and NWS officials. SN features GIS capabilities for use with external websites and apps. Several papers have been written on the use of the Spotter Network in meteorological research and operations such as: * Emerging Technologies in the Field to Improve Information in Support of Operations and Research * The Digital Revolution of Storm Spotting Modernizations of Training, Tracking, and Reporting * Enriching the Modern Day Storm Spotter Through Technology & Education Enhancements The SN is officially a Minnesota non-profit corporation, and is recognized as a 501(c)(3) organization by the IRS and is run as an organization of like-minded individuals taking input from the various communities that it serves and making the output available to any and all who are interested in severe weather.

Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 558 U.S. 67 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court decision on labor disputes. Background The Railway Labor Act was created to enable peaceful resolution of labor disputes between Railroad Companies and their Unions. For disputes deemed minor a panel of five would meet; two from the railroad industry, two from the unions and one neutral party under the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In order to reach arbitration the two parties had to exhaust their grievance procedures under their own Collective Bargaining Agreements (CBA). If this fails then either party may refer the issue to the NLRB with full statements of facts that these negotiations took place. Union Pacific Railroad Company issued disciplinary violations against five of its employees represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), a division of the Teamsters. The union then initiated grievance proceedings under their CBA. Dissatisfied with the outcome, the Union appealed to the NLRB Board. In opening proceedings one of the industry representatives objected that there was no evidence in the filing that the two parties had conferenced under their CBA. The NLRB dismissed their petition for lack of required evidence. It also denied the BLET the right to add proof of conferencing to the complaint because as an appellate body it is not permitted to receive new evidence. The District Court for the Northern District of Illinois affirmed the decision of the NLRB where it was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Appellate Court decided that the singular question at issue was whether written documentation of CBA arbitration was a required perquisite to NLRB arbitration. The court determined there was no such requirement in any rules or regulations of the NLRB and had acted outside the will and intent of the Congress. However the Seventh Circuit did not invoke only statutory grounds for rejection of the NLRB but ruled that the NLRB proceedings had violated the Union's due process. Decision of the Court The Court ruled unanimously with Justice Ginsburg writing the opinion. The Court agreed with the outcome of the Seventh Circuit but not its reasoning. Ginsburg wrote that the Appeals Court had incorrectly applied a constitutional remedy instead of purely a statutory one, the court affirmed the Seventh Circuit ruling on statutory grounds and ruling that the NLRB had not denied due process but had merely \\"failed to conform or confine itself to the jurisdiction Congress gave it.\\" See also *Union Pacific R.

Like Caroline Whitting (1872) and Phoebe Veitch (1883) before them, but unlike Minnie Dean subsequently (1895), the two women were initially sentenced to death for the killing of Anna's 'illegitimate' child and Sarah Jane's grandchild but were subsequently reprieved. In this instance, the intervention of the then-Governor-General of New Zealand William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow was required for mitigation of the death penalty to life imprisonment. Trial, verdict and psychiatric incarceration On January 10, 1891, the body of Anna Flannagan's illegitimate infant child was found, mutilated, after Miss Flannagan had taken her from Jane Freeman, the wet nurse that was feeding her-although Anna Flannagan had been introduced as \\"Mrs Stevens\\", Freeman knew her to be the latter.\\"Christchurch Infanticide Case\\" Evening Post: January 13, 1891 It was alleged that in a moment of maternal madness, Anna Flannagan had killed the child, although she was later lucid enough to be arrested on attempting to flee to Sydney, Australia. In February 1891, Christchurch, New Zealand residents Anna Flannagan (25), her mother Sarah Jane Flannagan (50) and Sarah Jane's husband, former Constable Daniel Flannagan, were all accused of killing Anna's illegitimate child, although they claimed to have been attacked by a gang of male assailants who killed the infant and dragged Anna through the streets at the end of a rope. Daniel Flannagan was later discharged, but on February 25, 1891, Sarah-Jane and Anna Flannagan were found guilty and sentenced to death.\\"Christchurch Child Murder Case\\" Marlborough Express 26 February 1891 On March 13, 1891, the sentence was then commuted to life imprisonment.\\"Christchurch Murder\\" Thames Star: 13 March 1891 However, in November 1892, it was reported that Anna Flannagan had become a 'hopeless lunatic' and she was taken from Lyttelton Gaol to Sunnyside Hospital, a Christchurch psychiatric institution.\\"Miscellaneous' Poverty Bay Herald: 26 February 1891 Subsequently, it was reported that there were petitions for the release of Anna Flannagan from psychiatric care to the Minister of Justice and Governor General in 1894. Anna was subsequently released in 1895 \\"Miscellaneous\\" Otago Daily Times: 3 April 1894 As for Sarah- Jane, she was also relocated to the Terrace Gaol, but was released after serving fifteen years imprisonment, in 1906. Daniel Flannagan was never able to rejoin the New Zealand Police thereafter, despite his earlier acquittal. Arthur Hume, Commissioner of Police:To Minister of Justice 8 May 1905: J40: 906/99 However, given the social stigma attached to illegitimacy during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and the leniency meted out to perceived 'spontaneous' infanticide cases born of wretched parental circumstances such as poverty, lone parenting, family violence and other contextual factors, Bronwyn Daley has suggested that capital cases of infanticide carried out by mothers were usually mitigated to life imprisonment after appeal to higher judicial authorities or, in this case, Ministers of the Crown and the Governor General of New Zealand himself Bronwyn Dalley: \\"Criminal Conversations: Gender and narratives of child murder in nineteenth century New Zealand\\" in Caroline Dalley and Julie Montgomerie (eds) The Gendered Kiwi: Auckland: Auckland University Press: 1999 As William Onslow noted in his official record of the appeal for clemency in this instance, there was also widespread public aversion to use of capital punishment in New Zealand when it came to culpable women (given that Minnie Dean (1895)) was the only woman executed in New Zealand criminal history until capital punishment was abolished in 1961. Appendix to the Journal of the House of Representatives 1891: Session II: A-01 There are few other resources available to contemporary scrutiny, other than contemporary newspaper records of the trial, the sentence and its commutation to life imprisonment. The newspaper accounts also recorded the subsequent determination that Anna Flannagan was experiencing mental illness and needed to be admitted to Sunnyside Hospital from Lyttelton Gaol in 1892, as well as that of the appeal to William Onslow, 4th Earl of Onslow (the Governor General of New Zealand) for clemency in parliamentary official records, and a subsequent petition that requested the release of Anna Flannagan from Sunnyside in 1894. According to Bronwyn Dalley's analysis of late nineteenth and early twentieth century New Zealand infanticide cases, Anna was released from Sunnyside custody in 1895 and her mother from Terrace Gaol in 1906. Thereafter, there is no further information about the lives of Anna and Sarah Jane Flannagan after their respective releases from incarceration. In recent assessment of the case, Alison Clarke commented that the case of the Flannagans did not attract considerable public sympathy due to the perceived brutality of the purported offence, the greater age of Sarah- Jane Flannagan (thirty-two) and that this had not been her first pregnancy. Thus, she was perceived as being in a different existential and moral context from younger single women who were perceived as being 'seduced and abandoned' by unscrupulous and negligent older men or irresponsible male contemporaries. Indeed, as the Wellington Evening Post commented, there had been widespread outrage when the original sentence of capital punishment in New Zealand had been commuted to imprisonment after Flannagan had been found guilty of murder. Clarke suggests that this may have influenced the later death penalty meted out to baby farmer Minnie Dean in 1895, who was the only woman executed in New Zealand criminal history until the abolition of capital punishment in New Zealand in 1951.

Maatsen made his d√©but, in the opening game of the season, when he came on as a substitute in the 72nd minute in a 2‚Äì0 loss against Feyenoord. In numbers of games, Maatsen would mostly come on the bench as a substitute. In a match against Twente, on 2 October 2011, Mastsen came on as a substitute in the 82nd minutes and with eight minutes remaining until full-time, Maatsen scored twice to make a comeback in a 2‚Äì2 draw. Later in the 2011‚Äì12 season, Maatsen would score three more goals against Ajax, NAC Breda and VVV-Venlo, to add a tally to his Excelsior career, but the club was relegated to Eerste Divisie, having finished eighteenth place with nineteenth points.

The material can be recovered from various sources including dust from the vicinity of a nuclear facility, or from the radioactive debris following a nuclear explosion. Results of nuclear forensic testing are used by different organisations to make decisions. The information is typically combined with other sources of information such as law enforcement and intelligence information. History The first seizures of nuclear or otherwise radioactive material were reported in Switzerland and Italy in 1991. Later, reports of incidents of nuclear material occurred in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other central European countries. Nuclear Forensics became a new branch of scientific research with the intent of not only determining the nature of the material, but also the intended use of the seized material as well as its origin and about the potential trafficking routes. Nuclear forensics relies on making these determinations through measurable parameters including, but not limited to chemical impurities, isotopic composition, microscopic appearance, and microstructure. By measuring these parameters, conclusions can be drawn as to the origin of the material. Identification of these parameters is an ongoing area of research, however, data interpretation also relies on the availability of reference information and on knowledge of the fuel cell operations. The first investigative radiochemical measurements began in the early days of nuclear fission. In 1944, the US Air Force made the first attempts to detect fissiogenic 133Xe in the atmosphere in order to indicate the production of plutonium through the irradiation of uranium and chemical reprocessing in an effort to gather intelligence on the status of the German nuclear program. However, no 133Xe was detected. In the subsequent years it became increasingly valuable to gather information on the Soviet nuclear weapons program, which resulted in the development of technologies that could gather airborne particles in a WB-29 weather reconnaissance plane. On September 3, 1949, these particles were used to determine that the detonation time of the first Soviet atomic test, \\"Joe 1\\". Further analysis revealed that this bomb was a replicate of the \\"Fat Man\\", which was the bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945. This investigative methodology combined radiochemistry and other techniques to gather intelligence on nuclear activities. The first seizures of nuclear materials from trafficking in the early 1990s allowed the nuclear forensic methodology to be adopted by a wider scientific community. When scientific laboratories outside the weapons and intelligence community took an interest in this methodology was when the term \\"Nuclear Forensics\\" was coined. Unlike standard forensics, nuclear forensics focuses mainly on the nuclear or radioactive material and aims to provide knowledge of the intended use of the materials. In 1994 560 grams of plutonium and uranium oxide were intercepted at Munich airport in an airplane coming from Moscow. The precise composition was 363 grams plutonium (87% of which was Plutonium-239) and 122 grams of uranium. It later emerged through a German parliamentary enquiry that the purchase had been arranged and financed by the German Federal Intelligence Service. Chronometry Determining a nuclear material's age is critical to nuclear forensic investigations. Dating techniques can be utilized to identify a material's source as well as procedures performed on the material. This can aid in determining the information about the potential participant in the \\"age\\" of the material of interest. Nuclides, related through radioactive decay processes will have relative sample concentrations that can be predicted using parent-daughter in-growth equations and relevant half-lives. Because radioactive isotopes decay at a rate determined by the amount of the isotope in a sample and the half-life of the parent isotope, the relative amount of the decay products compared to the parent isotopes can be used to determine \\"age\\". Heavy element nuclides have a 4n+2 relationship, where the mass number divided by 4 leaves a remainder of two. The decay network begins with 238Pu and proceeds through the in-growth of long-lived 234U, 230Th, and 226Ra. If any member of the 4n+2 decay chain is purified it will immediately begin to produce descendant species. The time since a sample was last purified can be calculated from the ratio of any two concentrations among the decaying nuclides. Essentially, if a nuclear material has been put through a refinement process to remove the daughter species, the time elapsed since purification can be \\"back-calculated\\" using radiochemical separation techniques in conjunction with analytical measurement of the existing parent-daughter ratios. For example, the Œ± decay of 239Pu to 235U can be used as an example of this procedure. with the assumption of a perfect purification time T0 then there will be a linear relationship between the in-growth of 235U and time elapsed since purification. There are, however, various instances where the correlation is not as clear. This strategy may not apply when the parent- daughter pair achieve secular equilibrium very rapidly or when the half-life of the daughter nuclide is significantly shorter than the time that has elapsed since purification of the nuclear material, e.g. 237Np/233Pa. Another possible complication is if in environmental samples, non-equivalent metal/ion transport for parents and daughter species may complicate or invalidate the use of chronometric measurements. Special age-dating relationships exist, including the commonly employed 234U/230Th and 241Pu/241Am chronometers. In special circumstances, parent-granddaughter relationships can be used to elucidate the age of nuclear materials when the material is intentionally made to look older through the addition of daughter nuclides. Chronometry is based on the concept that the composition of the nuclear material changes as samples are prepared and analyzed. This barrier can be substantial for species that decay quickly or whose daughter products put forth spectral interferences. The decay of 233U, for example, has a t1/2~1.6x105years which is rapid in comparison to many species and yield 229Th, which emits an Œ± particle that is isoenergetic, having the same energy, as the parent. To avoid this, freshly prepared samples as well as complementary analysis methods are used for confident nuclear materials characterization. The decay of nuclear samples makes rapid analysis methods highly desirable. Separations Chemical separation techniques are frequently utilized in nuclear forensics as a method of reducing the interferences and to facilitate the measurement of low level radionuclides. Purification that occurs rapidly as progeny in-growth begins immediately following purification is ideal.  Anion Exchange  Anion exchange separation methods are widely used in the purification of actinides and actinide bearing materials through the use of resin columns. The anionic actinide complexes are retained by anion exchange sites that are on the resin and neutral species pass through the column unretained. Then the retained species can be eluted from the column by conversion to a neutral complex, typically by changing the mobile phase passed through the resin bed. Anion exchange-based separations of actinides, while valued for there simplicity and widely used, tend to be time-consuming and are infrequently automated. Most are still dependent on gravity. Speeding up the flow of the mobile phase tends to introduce problems such as impurities and jeopardize future investigations. Hence, there is still a need for development of this technique to satisfy the nuclear forensic research priorities. Co-Precipitation Actinide isolation by co-precipitation is frequently used for samples of relatively large volumes to concentrate analytes and remove interferences. Actinide carriers include iron hydroxides, lanthanide fluorides/hydroxides, manganese dioxide, and a few other species. Analysis A wide range of instrumental techniques are employed in nuclear forensics. Radiometric counting techniques are useful when determining decay products of species with short half-lives. However, for longer half-lives, inorganic mass spec is a powerful means of carrying out elemental analysis and determining isotopic relationships. Microscopy approaches can also be useful in characterization of a nuclear material. Counting Techniques Counting techniques of Œ±,Œ≤,Œ≥ or neutron can be used as approaches for the analysis of nuclear forensic materials that emit decay species. The most common of these are alpha and gamma spectroscopy. Œ≤ counting is used infrequently because most short lived Œ≤-emitters also give off characteristic Œ≥-rays and produce very broad counting peaks. Neutron counting are found more rarely in analytical labs due in part to shielding concerns should such neutron emitters be introduced into a counting facility. =Alpha-particle spectroscopy= Alpha-particle spectroscopy is a method of measuring the radionuclides based on emission of Œ± particles. They can be measured by a variety of detectors, including liquid scintillation counters, gas ionization detectors, and ion-implanted silicon semiconductor detectors. Typical alpha-particle spectrometers have low backgrounds and measure particles ranging from 3 to 10 MeV. Radionuclides that decay through Œ± emission tend to eject Œ± particles with discrete, characteristic energies between 4 and 6 MeV. These energies become attenuated as they pass through the layers of sample. Increasing the distance between the source and the detector can lead to improved resolution, but decreased particle detection. The advantages of alpha-particle spectroscopy include relatively inexpensive equipment costs, low backgrounds, high selectivity, and good throughput capabilities with the use of multi-chamber systems. There are also disadvantages of alpha-particle spectroscopy. One disadvantage is that there must be significant sample preparation to obtain useful spectroscopy sources. Also, spectral interferences or artifacts from extensive preparation prior to counting, to minimize this high purity acids are needed. Another disadvantage is that measurements require a large quantity of material which can also lead to poor resolution. Also, undesired spectral overlap and long analysis times are disadvantages. =Gamma Spectroscopy= Gamma spectroscopy yields results that are conceptually equivalent to alpha-particle spectroscopy, however, can result in sharper peaks due to reduced attenuation of energy. Some radionuclides produce discrete Œ≥-rays that produce energy between a few KeV to 10 MeV which can be measured with a gamma-ray spectrometer. This can be accomplished without destroying the sample. The most common gamma-ray detector is a semiconductor germanium detector which allow for a greater energy resolution than alpha-particle spectroscopy, however gamma spectroscopy only has an efficiency of a few percent. Gamma spectroscopy is a less sensitive method due to low detector efficiency and high background. However, gamma spectroscopy has the advantage of having less time-consuming sample procedures and portable detectors for field use. Mass Spectrometry Mass spec techniques are essential in nuclear forensics analysis. Mass spec can provide elemental and isotopic information. Mass spec also requires less sample mass relative to counting techniques. For nuclear forensic purposes it is essential that the mass spectrometry offers excellent resolution in order to distinguish between similar analytes, e.g. 235U and 236U. Ideally, mass spec should offer excellent resolution/mass abundance, low backgrounds, and proper instrumental function. =Thermal Ionization MS= In thermal ionization mass spectrometry, small quantities of highly purified analyte are deposited onto a clean metal filament. Rhenium or tungsten are typically used. The sample is heated in a vacuum of the ion source by applying a current to the filaments. A portion of the analyte will be ionized by the filament and then are directed down the flight tube and separated based on mass to charge ratios. Major disadvantages include time-consuming sample preparation and inefficient analyte ionization. =Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry= This is a frequently used technique in nuclear forensics. In this technique a purified sample is nebulized in a spray chamber and then aspirated into a plasma. The high temperature of the plasma leads to sample dissociation and high efficiency of ionization of the analyte. The ions then enter the mass spectrometer where they are discriminated based on mass based on a double focusing system. Ions of various masses are detected simultaneously by a bank of detectors similar to those used in the thermal ionization mass spec. MC-ICP-MS has a more rapid analysis because it does not require lengthy filament preparation. For high quality, however, there is a requirement for extensive sample cleanup. Argon plasma is also less stable and requires relatively expensive equipment as well as skilled operators. =Secondary-Ion MS= SIMS is a micro-analytical technique valuable for three-dimensional analysis of a materials elemental composition and isotopic ratios. This method can be utilized in characterization of bulk materials with a detection limit in the low parts per billion (10‚àí9 or ng/g) range. Particles as small as a few hundreds of nanometers can be detected. Ion production in this technique is dependent on the bombardment of solid samples with a focused beam of primary ions. The sputtered, secondary ions are directed onto the mass spectrometry system to be measured. The secondary ions are a result of kinetic energy transfer from the primary ions. These primary ions penetrate into the solid sample to some depth. This method can be used to detect any element, however the sputtering process is highly matrix dependent and ion yields vary. This method is especially useful, because it can be fully automated to find uranium particles in a sample of many million particles in a matter of hours. Particles of interest can then be imaged and further analyzed with very high isotopic precision. Additional Nuclear Forensic Methods Numerous additional approaches may be employed in the interrogation of seized nuclear material. In contrast to previously mentioned analysis techniques, these approaches have received relatively low attention in recent years in terms of novel advancement, and, typically, require greater quantities of sample. =Scanning electron microscope= The scanning electron microscope can provide images of an object's surface at high magnification with a resolution on the order of nanometers. A focused beam of energetic electrons is scanned over the sample and electrons that a backscattered or emitted from the sample surface are detected. Images are constructed via measuring the fluctuations of electrons from the sample beam scanning position. This data is useful in determining what process may have been employed in the materials production and to distinguish between materials of differing origins. Measurement of backscattered electrons elucidate the average atomic number of the area being scanned. The emitted, or secondary electrons provide topological information. This is a relatively straight forward technique, however samples must be amenable to being under a vacuum and may require pre-treatment. =X-Ray Fluorescence= X-ray fluorescence offers rapid and non-destructive determination of the elemental composition of a nuclear material based on the detection of characteristic X-rays. Direct sample irradiation allows for minimal sample preparation and portable instrumentation for field deployment. The detection limit is 10 ppm. This is well above mass spectrometry. This technique tends to be hindered by matrix affects, which must be corrected for. =Neutron Activation Analysis= Neutron activation analysis is a powerful non-destructive method of analyzing elements of mid to high atomic number. This method combines excitation by nuclear reaction and the radiation counting techniques to detect various materials. The measurement of characteristic radiation, following the bombardment completion, is indicative of the elements of interest. The equation for the production product is given by: A + n \\\\to B^{*} + \\\\gamma where A is the starting analyte, n is the incoming neutron, B^{*} is the excited product and \\\\gamma is the detected radiation that results from the de-excitation of the product species. The advantages of this technique include multi-element analysis, excellent sensitivity, and high selectivity, and no time-consuming separation procedures. One disadvantage is the requirement of a nuclear reactor for sample preparation. = X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy = X-Ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) has been demonstrated as a technique for nuclear forensic investigations involving uranium speciation. Both the lower energy near-edge (XANES) and higher energy fine structure (EXAFS) analytical methods may be useful for this type of characterisation. Typically, XANES is employed to determine the oxidation state of the absorbing uranium atom, while EXAFS can be used to determine its local atomic environment. This spectroscopic method, when coupled with X-Ray diffraction (XRD), would be of most benefit to complex nuclear forensic investigations involving species of different oxidation states.

It was released as a promotional single on April 24, 2012, and served as the third official single from the album. The song was written and composed by Jude Gitamondoc, and produced by Ito Rapadas under Universal Records. It is the second ballad song in the album, following the acoustic track \\"However Much Love.\\" The song is an inspirational power ballad, and it shows off the singer's power vocals and belting range during the latter part of the song. The song talks about holding on to your dreams, and not letting anyone get on your way in achieving it. \\"Believe in the Dream\\" was a critical acclaim, being given overwhelming positive reviews by OPM critics. PhilCharts.com called the song a \\"standout,\\" commenting \\"shows her [Nina] impressive vocal range.\\" The song was supposed to be released internationally, alongside the album but Universal canceled promotion for unknown reasons. Nina has performed the song live in Stay Alive's album launch and in her 2012 pre- Valentine concert at the Music Museum entitled Update Your Status... Background and release In the last quarter of 2010, Nina revealed that she was recording an all-original studio album, stating \\"I only have two cover songs in there and the rest are originals. It's going to be sexy-soul which is like singing from the soul but when you hear it, there's a degree of sexiness to it. That's me 'eh. I'm really a singer that sings from the soul, bonus na lang 'yung sexy na part [the sexy part is just a bonus].\\" In her early years, Nina was an unsure aspiring artist who almost let go of her dreams. Due to this fact, she made certain to include an inspirational song encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. She further described the song in the following statement: > \\"I have a song there [in the album] that has a message about not giving up > on your dreams. That's important for me because I, really, almost gave up > [...] If this is what you always wanted to do, if this is your dream, don't > lose hope. Go for it. Me, I almost gave up and if not for my faith and > belief in God, I would have lost the hope that was left. So, just really > keep on reaching for your dreams.\\" During the interview, Nina announced that the album will be released in mid- January 2011. However, it was pushed back to a February release. In the February 2011 issue of Woman Today magazine, she expressed postponing the album release, again, scheduling it in June 2011.Woman Today (February 2011), upcoming album's release date, accessed 2011-12-04 In May 2011, Universal Records' head executive Kathleen Dy-Go stated that Nina has not yet finished recording the album, which may result the release date to be pushed back--for the third time--to July or August. Nina later confirmed that the upcoming album will finally be released in the last week of September 2011, that her main goal is to create a different kind of music for her fans and that she does not expect for it [the album] to be a huge hit. Despite the announcement, the album--which was later revealed to be entitled Stay Alive--was not released until November 19, 2011. Prior to the release of Stay Alive, Universal Records' official YouTube channel posted a preview of the album on November 10, 2011, which only consists of the first nine tracks including a clip from \\"Believe in the Dream\\". Composition and critical reception \\"Believe in the Dream\\" is an inspirational ballad song, that contains elements of rhythm and blues and soul. The song's structure is comparable to that of power ballads. It highlights Nina's vocal range, where she continuously belted out several notes from the bridge part until the song fades. Lyrically, the song talks about holding on to your dreams, and not letting anyone get in your way to achieving it. It also interprets faith in yourself and belief in God. The song was a critical acclaim, being called a \\"standout\\" by music critics. FORG of PhilCharts.com stated \\"The standout ballad in the album is the inspirational song ‚ÄúBelieve in the Dream‚Äù where Nina not only shows her impressive vocal range but she also heightens the song‚Äôs emotion through the rawness that exudes from her vocals. It‚Äôs probably the song where Nina gave her all.\\" Music video \\"Believe in the Dream\\" was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, and was accompanied by an official lyric video posted by Universal Records' official YouTube channel on the same day. The video features screen captures of Nina's shots from the album booklet of Stay Alive, with each photo flashing alternately after another. Live performances On January 29, 2012, Stay Alive Mall Tour had its first leg at Market! Market! Taguig, where Nina performed \\"Believe in the Dream\\" and most of the album songs with intensive choreography including \\"Dance\\", \\"Staying Alive\\" and \\"Only with You\\". On January 30, 2012, she sang \\"Believe in the Dream\\" in Hitachi Philippines' \\"Awakening\\" Distributorship Night at Century Seafood Restaurant. On the following night, she performed the same song for the Philippine Marketing Association anniversary. On February 5, 2012, she promoted the album at SM City Baguio as part of the mall tour, where she performed \\"Believe in the Dream\\" and other Stay Alive songs. She also sang her number-one hits \\"Love Moves in Mysterious Ways\\" and \\"Someday\\".

In 1952 she also took part in Chifuren, when it was formed, one of the largest women's organizations in Japan with more than 6 million members. She was also Chifuren's President. Biography Yamataka was born in Mie Prefecture. She began her career in Japan as a journalist. She worked at Kokumin Shinbun and Shufu no Tomo. With Fusae Ichikawa, she co-founded the Women's Suffrage Union (Women's Suffrage League) in Japan in 1924. They hoped to extend suffrage to women, but when the government passed the Men's Suffrage Law in 1924, women were excluded. Despite this, the Women's Suffrage Union continued its work for many years. After the end of World War II, Yamataka continued her political activism. She worked for war pensions to be granted to widows of war veterans, and for children's rights. On August 25, 1945, Yamataka co-founded the Women's Committee on Postwar Policy (Sengo Taisaku Fujin Iinkai). The co-founders were Fusae Ichikawa, Tsuneko Akamatsu, and Natsu Kawasaki. The first meeting was on September 11, 1945, with over 70 women in attendance. Among the priorities of the organization were: welcoming returning soldiers, improving food production, increasing household savings, gaining suffrage for women over 20, establishing the right for women over 25 to run for office, reforming the local and central governments, and allowing women to hold jobs in the civil service. When women gained suffrage in Japan in 1945, Yamataka ran for public office and was elected twice (1962-1971) to the House of Councillors, the upper house in the Diet of Japan, the country's federal government. In 1952, Yamataka co-founded the National Federation of Regional Women's Organizations, known as Chifuren, in Japan. She eventually became President and remained in this role until her death in 1977. Chifuren was also active in promoting consumer protection and household economy.

He was apprenticed to a printer; became editor and manager of the Lincolnshire Times. He arrived Melbourne in 1852‚Äì1853 where he became a reporter at the Melbourne Morning Herald subsequently a contractor for supplies to Legislative Council Club; superintendent of works Vic.

Career He was elected to Legislative Assembly of Victoria for the electoral district of Geelong in November 1856 and held it until August 1859, then in the electoral district of Geelong West from October 1859 to August 1864. He was Commissioner of Crown Lands in Victoria under the Heales administration from November 1860 to November 1861, and remembered in connection with the land system of that colony. In 1857, as a member of the Assembly, he was prominent in opposition to the Haines Land Bill, which proposed giving annual licences to the squatters. On his own accession to office he, in conjunction with his colleagues Mr. J. M. Grant and Mr. Ireland, the Attorney-General, brought into operation the famous licences to occupy the waste lands of the Crown, which formed the basis of popular settlement for cultivation purposes on the public lands of Victoria. The scheme was formulated by a mere Gazette notice, the issue of which was formally censured by the Legislative Council. As the result of a dissolution of the Assembly Mr. Brooke's policy was approved by the country, and formed the subject of express eulogy in the Governor's opening speech to the new Parliament in August 1861. The occupation licences were approved by the new Assembly and again condemned by the Council, who denounced the introduction of the new departure by a mere departmental regulation as a breach of the principles of responsible government. The Governor regretted the disapprobation of the Council, but when they entreated that the legality of the licences might be tested in the Supreme Court, replied that his advisers were \\"satisfied of their legality.\\" He again nominated for the seat in 1864 though withdrew. He left for Japan in 1867 where he became editor and proprietor of the Japan Daily Herald, one of the first foreign newspapers in Japan.

Pfister (June 17, 1859 ‚Äì November 12, 1927) was a wealthy tannery magnate, bank financier, utility owner, newspaper publisher, hotelier and philanthropist in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He was also a central figure in the stalwart \\"Old Guard\\" of the Republican Party of Wisconsin during the rise of the state's progressive Republicans. Although never a political candidate himself, Pfister advised on tactics and used his vast holdings to fund the party's operations, dictate favored legislation, and re-edit the opinion pages of Wisconsin newspapers. A lifelong bachelor, Pfister belonged to many clubs and organizations but shunned the spotlight. He donated much of his fortune to local arts groups and charities. Early life and career Charles Frederick Pfister was born as Charles Frederick Weisert in Milwaukee on June 17, 1859; in 1870, he was adopted by Guido Pfister, an emigre from Wurtemberg, Germany.Spiekermann, Uwe. \\"Business and Politics: The Contested Career of Charles F. Pfister.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified June 08, 2016. Guido's cousin and fellow emigre Frederick Vogel founded a tannery on Milwaukee's Menominee River while Pfister opened a shoe store on nearby West Water Street. Combining forces as the Pfister & Vogel Leather Company, their company thrived, becoming one of the largest leather producers in the country.\\"How Two German Boys Started Milwaukee's Tanneries\\" by Clif F. Woods, Milwaukee Telegram, November 6, 1921 Charles Pfister was educated at the city's Engelmann Academy (later the German-English Academy, which Pfister paid to rebuild and dedicated to his father in 1891).\\"A Seat of Learning,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, March 15, 1891 After his 1876 graduation he went to work in his father's business offices. In 1878 he became the sales manager of the company's retail shoe store. Four years later he proved to Vogel he could open eastern markets, selling railcar loads of leather to shoemakers in cities like New York, Boston and Philadelphia. Relying on just eight \\"jobbers\\" to fill the orders, company stock tripled. Later Pfister became the company's treasurer and then its president.\\"Gained Fame as Salesman in Early Days,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, November 12, 1927 Guido Pfister used the new capital to expand into other Milwaukee businesses and interests. Before his death in 1889, he consolidated banks to form the Merchants Exchange bank. Son Charles succeeded his father as bank director and invested in many local enterprises, including the city's first electric rail line, owned by local Democratic boss John Hinsey. He oversaw the bank's merger with the First National bank in 1893, and with the First Wisconsin National bank in 1919. Pfister also directed and invested in other banks, as well as railroads, toll roads, insurance companies, trust companies, heavy industries (such as Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing), land companies, plus lumber and mining interests, in and out of Wisconsin. The Pfister Hotel In 1889 Pfister held stock in the Milwaukee Hotel company and paid a high price to buy up a majority of the shares, allowing him to fulfill his father's vision of building the greatest hotel in the city. The lavish Pfister Hotel opened in May 1893, costing over $1 million and outfitted with the latest amenities. The hotel struggled in its first year, with Pfister losing several hundred dollars a day. It wasn't until the state Republican convention in July 1894 that the hotel was filled to capacity. It became the home of many political operations and official functions, and was the preferred hotel of visiting dignitaries and celebrities. Pfister personally guided the hotel, for many years living in one of its suites.\\"Mr. Pfister's Personality Guided Hotel,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, November 12, 1927 Following a paralytic stroke in 1927 Pfister sold the hotel to longtime employee Ray Smith, who Pfister had mentored since Smith was a child. The hotel houses a large collection of the Victorian art that Pfister's close friend art dealer Henry Reinhardt selected for the hotel.\\"Busy Man Was Patron of Art,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, November 12, 192 Reports that Pfister's ghost haunts the hotel became widespread in 2009 after several visiting major league baseball players refused to stay there after reporting suspicious occurrences.\\"Is Pfister ghost picking on baseball players?\\" by Chris Jenkins and Colin Fly of the Associated Press, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, July 11, 2009 Managing a monopoly As a director of railroad magnate Henry Villard's North American Company, Pfister acquired John Hinsey's street railway and his electricity company. By buying up all the other street lines and power companies in the city, he created the first transit and power monopoly in the country. The corporation expanded into the largest utility holding corporation in the world, controlling the utilities in many large cities such as St. Louis, Cleveland and San Francisco. After the Panic of 1893 the overcapitalized corporation was drowning in debt, and sought to balance its books by raising electricity rates on homes and businesses, discontinuing commuter rail passes, evading taxes and violating city ordinances. A huge public outcry was followed by a call for municipally owned utilities. Driven into receivership, the monopoly was re-organized by Pfister, F.G. Bigleow and state Republican boss Henry Clay Payne as The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company (TMER&L;). Refusing to lower its train fares during the depression, the company soon became the most hated institution in the city. In 1896, the company hired strikebreakers to put down a strike by the Amalgamated Street Railway Employees Union, and the next week a public boycott was launched. Over the next five years TMER&L; arrogantly fought off all demands for accountability by lobbying the state legislature and bribing city aldermen. Pfister even forsaked his own party by supporting the Democrat David Stuart Rose for mayor when calls for reform from the city's progressive Republicans gained traction. Through intense lobbying of the Common Council Payne and Pfister secured legal immunity for the company by pushing through a 35-year contract with the city. The near unanimous backlash from local businessmen, church leaders and newspapers against such political manipulation resulted in widespread support for progressive reforms.The New Citizenship by David P Thelen, 1972, University of Missouri Press, pp.250-289 In 1905 Pfister was indicted by Milwaukee district attorney (and future governor) Francis E. McGovern in a rendering company bribery scandal, but was acquitted for lack of testimony. Running Wisconsin's Republican party During the 1890s Pfister began to take a commanding role in the state's Republican party. After the Democratic party gained control of the state government in 1891, they brought suit against former state treasurers and their bondsmen when it was revealed that state funds had been deposited in favored banks with the earned interest unaccounted for. Pfister, U.S. Senator Philetus Sawyer and other members of the Republican \\"Old Guard\\" had been the treasurers' bondsmen, with Pfister being liable for over $100,000 in funds. The Democrats had succeeded in retrieving half the state's money, but when the Republicans came back to power in 1894 they stopped prosecuting the treasury cases. Pfister worked behind the scenes to push bills through the Republican legislature that absolved the former treasurers and their bondsmen. The bills were reluctantly signed by stalwart-backed governor William H. Upham.The History of Wisconsin, Volume IV, The Progressive Era 1893-1914, by John D. Buenker, 1998, the State Historical Society of Wisconsin, pp.408-409La Follette's Winning of Wisconsin, by Albert O. Barton, Homestead Company Press, Iowa, pp.42-43 Doubting Upham's re- electability in the next election, Pfister and other members of the state's machine met in a hotel room during the 1896 Republican convention in St. Louis and decided Edward Scofield would be the next Republican nominee for Wisconsin governor. After the subsequent state convention, candidate Robert M. La Follette claimed that Pfister admitted to buying away his pledged delegates and told him \\"If you behave yourself, we will take care of you when the proper time comes.\\" La Follette denounced the offer.La Follette's Winning of Wisconsin, by Albert O. Barton, Homestead Company Press, Iowa, pp.70-72 President William McKinley's campaign manager Mark Hanna held Pfister in high regard and credited his optimism in McKinley's 1900 re-election campaign.\\"Regret Voiced in Capital at Pfister Death,\\" Milwaukee Sentinel, November 15, 1927 Pfister's influence with president Theodore Roosevelt secured the office of postmaster general for his political partner Henry C. Payne, providing new opportunities to bestow federal patronage jobs on allies. He contributed to temperance groups like the Anti-Saloon League and urged the nomination of \\"dry\\" candidates. Pfister was the acknowledged head of the state party for over twenty years, doling out political patronage to friends and failed candidates. In 1902 it was revealed that Pfister had secretly bought control of the editorial columns of some 300 of the state's newspapers. The scandal gave a boost to governor La Follette's re-election campaign and diminished Pfister's stature among the next wave of conservatives.The Decline of the Progressive Movement in Wisconsin, by Herbert F. Margulies, 1968, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, p.62 After stalwart Republican Emanuel L. Philipp was elected Wisconsin governor in 1915 he resisted Pfister's attempts at control.The Decline of the Progressive Movement in Wisconsin, by Herbert F. Margulies, 1968, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, p.169 Buying the Milwaukee Sentinel In the face of the electric street railway's resistance to outside control, even the steadfast Republican Milwaukee Sentinel angrily editorialized against the monopoly by 1899. Pfister and Payne responded by suing the paper for libel. Rather than going to trial and having their business practices revealed, Pfister bought the paper outright on February 18, 1901, paying an immense sum to buy up a majority of its stock.La Follette's Winning of Wisconsin, by Albert O. Barton, Homestead Company Press, Iowa, p. 324 After the death of his publisher Lansing Warren that summer, Pfister assumed publishing duties, immersing himself in the paper's operations and directing political coverage. Owning the Sentinel expanded his conservative influence from the convention backrooms to the pages of the largest daily paper in Wisconsin. The Sentinel immediately opposed the newly elected governor La Follette, and continued to denounce him as governor (and later, U.S. senator) for the next twenty years, whether it be for his progressive reforms or his stand against U. S. participation in World War I. Pfister sold the paper to the William Randolph Hearst's newspaper syndicate June 1, 1924. Philanthropy Pfister was a noted philanthropist, donating some of his fortune to a variety of local and state interests, from baseball franchises to conservation groups. He paid scholarships for promising young men and aided many civic, fraternal and Lutheran religious organizations. He gave freely to musical organizations, from choral groups to the Metropolitan Grand Opera. He also paid the scholarships for many talented young musicians. He also donated to art museums, charities and religious schools in Milwaukee and throughout the state, often giving large donations anonymously. Later life In 1912 Pfister bought a 150-acre lake retreat, \\"Camp Rest,\\" on Lake Five in Washington County, Wisconsin. There he kept schnauser dogs along with a small zoo of pheasants, pigeons, peacocks, turkeys and ducks. He erected a grand house there in the mission style for his guests, but preferred to sleep in a simple canvas structure on the grounds. While at Camp Rest he suffered a stroke of paralysis in April 1927, and seven months later he suffered a second stroke there. After being taken to his sister's home in Milwaukee he died of pneumonia on November 12, 1927.

Saint-Cyr won the engagement by forming most of his troops into gigantic attack columns and smashing through the Spanish lines. Cardedeu is located northeast of Barcelona, Spain. The action occurred during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. By the fall of 1808, a French corps under Guillaume Philibert Duhesme was besieged in Barcelona by a 24,000-man Spanish army led by Vives. With 23,000 Franco- Italian soldiers, Gouvion Saint-Cyr marched from France to relieve Duhesme's troops. First Saint-Cyr undertook the successful Siege of Roses. Confronted by the fortress of Girona, which had resisted two earlier attacks, the French general resorted to a risky strategy. Leaving his artillery and most of his supplies behind, he avoided Girona by marching 16,500 men though the mountains and headed for Barcelona. Saint-Cyr completely outgeneraled Vives, who was only able to marshal 9,000 troops to block his opponent. Vives drew up his outnumbered troops on high ground, but Saint-Cyr's huge columns proved unstoppable. The Spanish withdrew after suffering heavy losses and Barcelona was soon relieved. Background=French defeats As part of Emperor Napoleon's plan to seize the Kingdom of Spain in a military coup, several key points, including Barcelona were captured in February 1808.Gates (2002), pp. 10-11 Among other strong places, the French also seized San Sebasti√°n, Pamplona and Figueras by trickery.Oman (2010), I, pp. 36-37 On 2 May 1808, the Spanish people revolted against the Imperial French occupation in the Dos de Mayo Uprising.Gates (2002), p. 12 In the early summer of 1808, a 12,710-man French corps commanded by General of Division Guillaume Philibert Duhesme was stationed at Barcelona. General of Division Joseph Chabran's 1st Division had 6,050 soldiers in eight battalions, while General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's 2nd Division consisted of 4,600 men in six battalions. The 1,700 cavalry were organized in nine squadrons under Generals of Brigade Bertrand Bessi√®res and Fran√ßois Xavier de Schwarz. The force included 360 artillerists.Gates (2002), p. 482 This modest-sized corps was instructed to put down the insurrection in Catalonia, to send assistance to Marshal Bon-Adrien Jeannot de Moncey in his attempt to capture Valencia, and to hold Barcelona. Considering the intensity of the rebellion, these orders were unrealistic.Gates (2002), p. 59 Guillaume Philibert Duhesme's men were bottled up in Barcelona. Chabran and Schwarz were defeated at the Battles of the Bruch in mid-JuneSmith (1998), p. 260 and Duhesme was repulsed in the Battle of Gerona on 20-21 June.Smith (1998), p. 261 After securing the assistance of an improvised division commanded by General of Division Honor√© Charles Reille, Duhesme initiated the Siege of Gerona. This unsuccessful operation lasted from 24 July to 16 August before Duhesme retreated to Barcelona and Reille withdrew to Figueres. News of the French disaster at the Battle of Bailen on 22 July 1808 buoyed Spanish morale and depressed the Imperial troops.Smith (1998), p. 265-266 Duhesme's troops had to fight their way back through the hills and abandon their field artillery in order to make it back to Barcelona, where they arrived on 20 August.Oman (2010), I, p. 331 Mariano Alvarez de Castro commanded a Spanish division. Meanwhile, Marquis Del Palacio's division of regular Spanish troops arrived from the Balearic Islands. Supported by thousands of miquelets (Catalan militia) the Spaniards blockaded Barcelona at the beginning of August.Oman (2010), I, p. 327 On 31 July, they captured the castle of Mougat and its garrison of 150 Neapolitans with the help of Captain Thomas Cochrane and a British frigate.Smith (1998), pp. 264-265 Though Duhesme's 10,000 surviving troops were in a tight spot, Del Palacio did not press them very hard. The French commander was able to send strong columns through the loose blockade in order to gather food and other supplies. On 12 October, an Italian column was roughly handled at Sant Cugat del Vall√®s with 300 casualties and the expeditions stopped.Oman (1995), II, pp. 37-39 Because Del Palacio remained almost inert during his tenure of command, the Catalan Junta replaced him as Captain General with Juan Miguel de Vives y Feliu on 28 October.Oman (1995), II, pp. 40-41 This veteran of the War of the Pyrenees had led the Spanish left wing at the Battle of Boulou in 1794.Prats (2007), Boulou Vives skirmished with the French outpost line on 8 November, but then went into hibernation until reinforcements arrived under General Theodor von Reding. On 26 November, Vives pushed the French within the walls of Barcelona, inflicting about 100 casualties. According to a 5 November report, the Army of Catalonia under Vives had 20,033 soldiers available in five divisions and a small reserve. Brigadier General Mariano √Ålvarez de Castro led 5,600 soldiers of the Vanguard Division. The Vanguard included 100 cavalry in the volunteer San Narciso Hussars, the regular foot regiments of Ultonia Irish (300), Borbon (500), 2nd Barcelona (1,000), and 1st Wimpfen Swiss (400), and the volunteer tercios 1st Gerona (900), 2nd Gerona (400), Igualada (400), Cervera (400), 1st Tarragona (800), and Figueras (400). General Conde de Caldagues commanded the 4,998-strong 1st Division which consisted of six artillery pieces manned by 70 gunners, 50 sappers, the cavalry regiments Espa√±oles Hussars (220) and Catalonia Cazadores (180), the regular infantry regiments the 2nd Walloon Guards (314), Soria (780), Borbon (151), 2nd Savoia (1,734), and 2nd Swiss (270), and the volunteer tercios Tortosa (984) and elements of Igualada and Cervera (245). General Laguna supervised the 2,360-man 2nd Division with seven guns manned by 84 artillerists, 30 sappers, Espa√±oles Hussars (200), two battalions each of provincial grenadier militia of Old Castile (972) and New Castile (924), and the Zaragoza Volunteers (150).Oman (2010), I, pp. 635-636 General La Serna's 2,458-man 3rd Division comprised the regular two-battalion Granada Regiment (961), and the volunteer units 2nd Tarragona Tercio, Arzu division (325), and Sueltas companies (250). General Francisco Milans del Bosch led the 4th Division which was made up of 3,710 volunteer soldiers in the following tercios, 1st Lerida (872), Vich (976), Manresa (937), and Vall√®s (925). The 907-strong Reserve included four guns manned by 50 artillerymen, 20 sappers, 80 Espa√±oles Hussars, a 60-man detachment from the Spanish Guards, the detached grenadiers from the Soria (188) and Wimpfen (169) Regiments, and the General's bodyguard (340). Two divisions of Granadan reinforcements under Reding were just arriving or on the way. The 1st Division numbered 8,200 men and included one battalion of the 2nd Reding Swiss Regiment (1,000) and two 1,200-man battalions each of the 1st Granada, Baza, and Almeria Regiments. The 6,000-man 2nd Division consisted of 1,200-man battalions. These were the one- battalion Antequera and the two-battalion Santa F√© and Loxa Regiments. The Granada Hussars with 670 sabers and six artillery pieces worked by 130 gunners accompanied Reding's force. In addition, the 3rd Division of the Army of Aragon under General Luis Rebolledo de Palafox y Melci, 1st marqu√©s de Laz√°n was instructed to reinforce Vives on 10 November. The division numbered 4,688 soldiers and comprised 64 gunners, one troop of the Ferdinand VII Cazadores Cavalry (22), and the volunteer infantry battalions 1st Zaragoza (638), 3rd Zaragoza (593), Ferdinand VII (648), Daroca (503), La Reunion (1,286), and General Reserve (934).Oman (2010), I, p. 633 Saint-Cyr takes command Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr had orders from Napoleon to relieve Duhesme in Barcelona. After the failures of the summer, Napoleon appointed General of Division Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr to replace Duhesme on 17 August 1808. A week earlier, the emperor had ordered two crack divisions to reinforce the VII Corps from the garrison of Italy. General of Division Joseph Souham led 10 veteran French battalions while General of Division Domenico Pino commanded the best Italian units.Oman (2010), I, p. 333 On the other hand, Reille's division had been formed of 8,000 soldiers of indifferent quality. His rag-tag force included French National Guards, drafted gendarmes, French reserves and provisional units, one Swiss battalion, and the French 113th Line Infantry Regiment, plus cavalry and artillery. The so-called French 113th was actually made up of Italians from the recently annexed Grand Duchy of Tuscany.Oman (2010), I, pp. 319-320 For many years, Saint-Cyr served France with distinction and had \\"first-rate ability\\" according to historian Charles Oman. His soldiers recognized his talents and had confidence in him but he was too aloof to be loved by them. He was also very self-centered and quick to leave his fellow generals to their own devices. Saint-Cyr's dislike of Napoleon had held him back from earlier promotion. Though he later wrote darkly that the emperor wanted him to fail, Napoleon made him a Marshal of France in 1812. Saint-Cyr's reinforcements did not begin to assemble in southern France until mid-September and lack of wagons caused further delay. On 5 November Saint- Cyr's corps finally crossed the Pyrenees near the Fort de Bellegarde.Oman (1995), II, pp. 42-43 At this time, Saint-Cyr's VII Corps consisted of six infantry divisions, three cavalry brigades, and attached artillery. A roster from 10 October listed a total of 42,382 soldiers, but 1,302 were on detached duty and another 4,948 were wounded or sick. Of these, Chabran's 1st and Lechi's 2nd Divisions plus the cavalry brigades of Bessi√®res and Schwarz were bottled up in Barcelona with Duhesme. Reille's 3rd Division had one battalion each of the 32nd Light, 16th Line, and 56th Line Infantry Regiments, one battalion each of the 5th Reserve Legion, the Chasseurs des Montagnes, and the Swiss Valais, two battalions of the 113th Line, and four battalions of the Perpignan Provisional Regiment. Souham's 4th Division was made up of three battalions each of the 1st Light and 42nd Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the 7th Line, and one battalion each of the 3rd Light and 67th Line.Oman (2010), I, pp. 642-643 Pino's 5th Division comprised three battalions each of the Italian 1st Light, 2nd Light, and 6th Line Infantry Regiments, two battalions of the 4th Line, and one battalion each of the 5th and 7th Line. General of Division Louis Fran√ßois Jean Chabot's 6th Division included only two battalions of the 2nd Neapolitan Line Infantry Regiment and one battalion of the Chasseurs of the Eastern Pyrenees. General of Brigade Jacques Fontane's cavalry brigade consisted of the Royal and 7th Italian Chasseurs √† Cheval. The corps included the French 24th Dragoon Regiment which was unbrigaded. Of the divisions in Saint-Cyr's field army, Reille counted 4,612 men, Souham 7,712, Pino 8,368, and Chabot 1,988. The three cavalry regiments numbered 1,700 troopers while the gun crews had about 500 artllerists.Oman (1995), II, p. 44 Upon taking his new command, Saint-Cyr received his orders in person from Napoleon. The emperor instructed him that the relief of Barcelona was the prime objective but allowed him discretion in how to carry out the assignment. According to the latest information from Duhesme, Barcelona could be expected to hold out until the end of December before running out of food. Saint-Cyr decided that he must first reduce the port of Roses (Rosas) before marching to Duhesme's relief.Oman (1995), II, p. 45 The Siege of Roses consumed another month, lasting from 7 November to 5 December 1808. The successful operation cost the Imperial French forces about 1,000 killed, wounded, or died of disease.Smith (1998), pp. 271-272 With Roses out of the way, Saint-Cyr was free to direct his energies to the relief of Barcelona. After assigning Reille to hold Figueras and Roses and to protect the roads from France, Saint-Cyr had about 1,500 horsemen and 15,000 foot soldiers in three divisions of 26 total battalions. Girona (Gerona) stood squarely in the path that the French army would have to take. The French general knew that besieging Girona was out of the question; in the time it would take to capture the place, Barcelona would be starved out. Once past Girona, there were two available roads. Knowing that the coast road via Matar√≥ was obstructed and could easily be placed under the guns of the British Royal Navy, Saint-Cyr chose to use the inland road. In order for his plan to work, the Imperial general hoped to keep Vives guessing as to his true intentions and to defeat his opponent in detail.Oman (1995), II, pp. 58-60 Battle=French offensive Theodor von Reding, a Swiss, led the Spanish right wing. On 9 November 1808, Saint-Cyr massed his field army on the north bank of the Ter River opposite Girona. The following day, the French general advanced on the city as if to invest it. He wished to tempt √Ålvarez and Laz√°n into offering battle, but the two Spanish generals declined to be drawn out, seeing that their 8,000 men would be crushed. On the 11th, Saint-Cyr sent his artillery and wagon train back to Figueras and marched to La Bisbal d'Empord√† where his quartermasters handed out four days of rations to each soldier. Each soldier carried 50 cartridges of ammunition and mule train carried another 10 rounds per man. The French general was taking an enormous risk. If the army remained too long in the mountains it would starve and if it were forced to fight several battles it would be out of ammunition. On 12 November, the Franco-Italians passed near Palam√≥s and fought their way through a force of miquelets (Catalan militia) under Juan Clar√≥s.Oman (1995), II, p. 60 On 13 November, Saint-Cyr's host stumbled into Vidreres which was near the coast road that led to Malgrat de Mar, Matar√≥, and Barcelona. That evening the Imperial soldiers saw the campfires of Laz√°n to the north and other enemy campfires to the south. But Saint-Cyr knew of a secret path from a Perpignan smuggler; the route connected the coast road with the inland road. Several search parties that were sent out to find the path during the 14th failed to locate it, so Saint-Cyr personally set out with a small escort to find it. In this he was successful, though the group was nearly captured by guerillas and had to fight its way clear. On the 15th the entire Franco-Italian army snaked through the hills, bypassing the small fortress of Hostalric and reaching the inland road at Sant Celoni. At the latter place the Imperial troops scattered a force of miquelets under Milans. Though his men were tired, Saint-Cyr hustled his soldiers along the highway until they reached the dangerous Trentapassos defile which was found to be unoccupied. That evening the Franco- Italians could see a line of campfires ahead of them, indicating the presence of the Spanish army.Oman (1995), II, pp. 61-63 The report of Saint-Cyr's march into the hills on the 11th reached the Spanish camp promptly. Vives responded by sending Reding and seven battalions of his leading echelon, a total of 5,000 men, to watch the inland road. Milans with 3,000 volunteers was ordered to block the coast road. Though Caldagues begged him to send every available man to stop the Imperial army, Vives held back at least 16,000 troops to maintain the blockade of Barcelona. Finding the coast road clear, Milans moved to Sant Celoni where his men were defeated. The news of this action on the 15th finally prompted Vives to take an additional 4,000 men and march through the night to reinforce Reding at dawn on 16 November 1808. Caldagues and the remaining 12,000 troops kept up the blockade of Duhesme's troops. Consequently, Saint-Cyr's 16,500 troops only faced 9,000 Spaniards under Vives. Milans and 3,000 more were to the east, recovering from their repulse, while Laz√°n and 6,000 more were somewhere to the north. Action Domenico Pino disobeyed Saint-Cyr's orders and his division's first attack failed. The battlefield is located between Llinars del Vall√®s to the east and Cardedeu to the west.Gates (2002), p. 66 The Mogent River, a tributary of the Bes√≤s runs from the northeast to the southwest through the area and south of the Autopista AP-7. Several streams run into the Mogent from the north. Vives reached the position in the morning and consequently had no time to make a defensive plan. Instead, he deployed his first line behind the Riera de la Roca stream and his second line behind it, farther uphill. Reding's Granadan division held the right wing as far south as the Mogent, while Vives defended the center and left wing with his Catalan troops. There were three guns on a hill overlooking the main road in the center, two more artillery pieces on the left, and two guns with the reserve. The miquelets of Vich held the far left flank. Two battalions and two squadrons of the Espa√±oles Hussars were in reserve. The area was dotted with pine and oak groves amid plowed fields, making it hard for both sides to discern enemy movements.Oman (1995), II, p. 64 Joseph Souham's veteran French division breached the Spanish defenses. Saint-Cyr knew that time was of the essence. The last rations had been eaten, ammunition was running low, and every minute of delay allowed Laz√°n to close in on his rear. Instructing Chabot to hold the Trentapassos defile with three battalions, the French commander determined to smash through Vives' lines with the remaining 23 battalions. Pino's Italian division was in front, followed by Souham's French division. Saint-Cyr ordered Pino to keep his battalions in column formation and crash through the enemy lines by sheer impetus. Pino was forbidden to deploy a single battalion, not even to take prisoners.Oman (1995), II, pp. 64-65 As Pino's narrow column advanced to pierce the Spanish right-center, it began to come under galling fire from the flanks. Ignoring his orders, Pino panicked and sent Fontane with one battalion each of the 2nd Light and 7th Line to the right. He directed General of Brigade Luigi Mazzucchelli to the left with the remaining two battalions of the 2nd Light and three battalions of the 4th Line. The attack broke the Spanish first line but came to a stand before the second line, halfway up the hillside. Reding ordered the Espa√±oles Hussars to charge and sent his whole line forward. Mazzucchelli's Italians faltered and were chased back to their starting point.Oman (1995), II, p. 66 At this moment Saint-Cyr arrived at the front to witness the collapse of the first attack. The French commander immediately directed Souham's 10 battalions to angle to their left and assault Reding's right flank. He also sent Pino's second brigade, the three battalions each of the 1st Light and 6th Line, to rush the Spanish center. Fontane continued to distract the enemy's left flank with his two battalions. Souham's heavy column plowed into and ruptured Reding's line. Meanwhile, Pino's second brigade pressed back the Spanish center. With the Spanish position unraveling, Saint- Cyr ordered the Italian light cavalry under Carlo Balabio to charge up the main highway. As the horsemen galloped up the hill, the entire Spanish force bolted to the rear.Oman (1995), II, p. 66-67 The Imperial troops inflicted losses of 1,000 killed and wounded on their enemies. In addition, they scooped up 1,500 Spanish prisoners and captured five artillery pieces and two colors. Saint-Cyr reported losses of 600,Smith (1998), p. 272 mostly in Pino's Italian units. Reding was nearly captured while trying to rally his men. Vives abandoned his horse while escaping up a cliff. He reached the coast and was taken off to Tarragona in . Milans arrived on the scene after the battle was finished. Laz√°n never got as far as Sant Celoni, nor did he come into contact with Chabot's small division. After hearing the bad news, Laz√°n marched his command back to Girona. Result On the 16th Caldagues repelled an attempt by Duhesme to break out. But when he found out that night that Vives had been routed, he abandoned the blockade and fell back behind the Llobregat River. The Spanish army left behind large stocks of food at Sarri√†. On 17 November 1808, Saint-Cyr's victorious troops marched into Barcelona. He later claimed that Duhesme did not offer a word of thanks and even insisted that Barcelona could have held out for six more weeks. At this Saint-Cyr coldly produced a copy of one of Duhesme's messages pleading for immediate help.Oman (1995), II, p. 68 The campaign, however, was not over. On 21 December Saint-Cyr's army faced Vives, Reding, and Caldagues at the Battle of Molins de Rey.Smith (1998), p. 273 NotesReferences  See also Battles of the Peninsular War Battles in Catalonia Battles of the Napoleonic Wars Battles involving Spain Battles involving France Conflicts in 1808 1808 in Spain December 1808 events ","title":"Battle of Cardedeu"},{"id":"36023362","text":"Rene Osei Kofi (born 31 December 1991) is a Ghanaian-Dutch footballer who plays as a defender.

He was known for being a co-host of The Group and Chapman and Sump'n Else shows on WFAA-TV. He was known for being a DJ and announcer at KLIF-AM, one of the first Top 40 radio stations. Ralph was a \\"Teen Idol\\" broadcaster in the 1960s and was heard and seen in many television and radio commercials as well. In the mid-1960s he became known as \\"The Sanger-Harris Man\\" and was an official model for the Sanger-Harris department store. He starred in Night Fright, a 1967 American science-fiction film that was shot near Dallas, Texas. Personal life Ralph Durwood Baker Jr. was born on February 3, 1945, in Dallas, Texas, to his parents Ralph Baker Sr, and Marjorie Baker. He grew up in the Highland Park neighborhood of Dallas. As a teenager he attended Highland Park High School. He graduated high school in 1963. In the summer of 1965 Ralph was visiting a Dallas hotel where he met a young woman named Calleen Anderegg. She told him that she had just moved to Dallas from Salt Lake City, Utah, and that she hoped to become an actress and television personality. Baker told her that he was producing a program at WFAA-TV and had her audition for the producers of the show. She would become a regular member of The Group as well. Ralph and Calleen were often seen together on air. Though Ralph was once always seen with Calleen Anderegg, he had grown up with a girl by the name of Elizabeth McCord and always loved her. He married her in July 1995 and she later gave birth to his daughter Bailey Margaret Baker on January, 16 1996. Broadcasting career In 1963 Ralph was hired by WFAA-TV to help produce and star in a local bandstand program called The Group and Harrigan with popular KLIF DJ Ron Chapman who was known to D/FW as Irving Harrigan. Ron was already co-host of the Charlie and Harrigan Show on KLIF. They were told that they could not use the \\"Irving Harrigan\\" name because it belonged to the production team at KLIF. The program on WFAA became known as The Group and Chapman. Ralph's position in this program was to perform and lip-synch to top 40 hits of the time. The audience and performers would dance to the songs that were chosen. Joan Prather also joined the show around the same time. The show was broadcast every Saturday after the national ABC program The Hollywood Palace. Ralph would become popular with promotion and also as a commercial announcer on D/FW television and radio. The Sanger-Harris Man Ralph took a position as a model for the Sanger-Harris department store and was seen in the department stores catalogs and storefront displays. He also would advertise and sell their products. He hosted the Sanger-Harris fashion segment on Sump'n Else since the store was a sponsor of the program. KLIF announcer Ralph took a position at KLIF as a late night announcer. He would be heard with the famous KLIF PAMS Jingles and play the top 40 hits of the time. He was now a broadcaster on the 50,000 watt AM Top 40 powerhouse. Ralph would continue to be a KLIF announcer and also announce commercials and promotions on the station while co hosting the Sump'n Else show at WFAA-TV. Now Ralph had many different positions on DFW television and radio. He was one of the most seen and heard DFW broadcasters on different television and radio stations. This gave him more attention than many others since he had so many different positions. In November 1967, Ralph teamed up with KBOX and KVIL-FM DJ and Announcer Frank Jolley and John Agar, former husband of Shirley Temple, to film a space science horror film called Night Fright. Other local talents got the parts as the co-stars of this film. Sump'n Else changes Some people came and went from the Sump'n Else show. Calleen Anderegg left for college in September 1967 but came back in January 1968. The Sump'n Else \\"Psychedelic Light Show\\" episode broadcast on WFAA-TV on January 26, 1968. Calleen Anderegg was back with Ralph for this episode. The set was re-designed with lights and props that could light up and change with the music they were performing to. A rotating light globe and mirror reflecting the back of the set were used for this episode. This was the last episode of Sump'n Else. The afternoon Dialing For Dollars program broadcast on WFAA-TV in the afternoons and afterwards the afternoon movie broadcast. Ron Chapman had joined the team of KVIL-FM in 1968. Calleen Anderegg also worked with Ron at the production team for a brief time. Even after Sump'n Else ended, Ralph was still heard as a commercial announcer on KLIF and a commercial announcer on WFAA-TV. He continued to be The Sanger-Harris Man and his commercials were seen and heard all over Dallas Fort-Worth television and radio. In 1970 Ralph left Dallas/Fort Worth to become a national model and actor. He was seen in many national television series. He returned to Dallas in the 1980s and reunited with the Sump'n Else cast for the 20th Anniversary Episode on September 7, 1985. Back home In 1992 Ralph returned to Dallas and became a KRLD-AM news anchor and traffic reporter.

In memory implantation studies researchers make people believe that they remember an event that actually never happened. The false memories that have been successfully implanted in people‚Äôs memories include remembering being lost in a mall as a child, taking a hot air balloon ride, and putting slime in a teacher‚Äôs desk in primary school. Memory implantation techniques were developed in the 1990s as a way of providing evidence of how easy it is to distort people's memories of past events. Most of the studies on memory implantation were published in the context of the debate about repressed memories and the possible danger of digging for lost memories in therapy. The successful implantation of memories in people‚Äôs minds has implications for therapy and legal settings.  Successful memory implantation = Published studies  The first formal studies using memory implantation were published in the early 1990s, the most famous being \\"The Formation of False Memories\\" (commonly referred to as the \\"Lost in the Mall\\" study) by Loftus and Pickrell. The basic technique used in this study involved asking family members of a participant to provide narratives of events that happened when they were young and then add another event that definitely had not happened. The participants saw these four narratives and were told to try to remember as much as possible about each event. Across a number of studies using memory implantation, about 37% of people have come to remember parts of or entire events that never actually happened. Other studies have expanded on this paradigm by introducing photos instead of narratives. Wade and colleagues found that 50% of people came to remember details of a hot air balloon ride that never happened, after seeing a manipulated photo depicting the event. Later it has been argued that photos by themselves do not produce more false memories than narratives, but that both methods have the power to successfully implant false memories. Real photos have also been found to increase the creation of false memories. In a study by Lindsay and colleagues people were shown a childhood photo from the same time period as the false event. Seeing the photo resulted in more false memories, even when the photos did not depict the actual event. In a study with children 1999 Pezdek and Hodge found that it was easier to implant a memory of a plausible event (being lost in a mall) than an implausible one (receiving a rectal enema). Later follow up studies, however, show that the perceived plausibility of a false event can be changed, making the false event easier to implant. Taken together, these findings show that there are many factors that are important for the way people remember events. Mazzoni et al. also suggest a 3 processes model for the development of false memories through suggestions. The first process is to make people perceive the event as plausible, the second is to make people believe it is likely to have happened to them and the third step is to help people interpret thoughts and fantasies about the event as memories. Other factors influencing the likelihood of producing false memories include imagining the events and making a source- monitoring error, specifically reality monitoring.  Legal case  A real life example of memory implantation occurred during the criminal case against Paul Ingram. Ingram was accused by his daughters of recurring sexual abuse in their childhood. Ingram denied all allegations at first but after being interviewed by police and therapists he came to remember multiple instances of abuse. Psychologist Richard Ofshe considered this confession a result of suggestive questioning and decided to test his theory. He told Ingram about a made-up scenario and said it was another accusation made by his children. Ofshe asked Ingram to try and remember as much as possible about this new event. Ingram could not recall anything straight away but after thinking about it for some time came up with a written confession where he described in detail what had happened. His children confirmed to Ofshe that the event had never actually happened, Ingram had created an entirely false memory of an event after suggestions from Ofshe. Ofshe considered this successful memory implantation evidence of Paul Ingram‚Äôs suggestibility and in his opinion it questions the accuracy of Ingram's other confessions.  Implications  The methods used in memory implantation studies are meant to mimic those used by some therapists to recover repressed memories of childhood events. The high rate of people \\"remembering\\" false events shows that memories cannot always be taken at face value. Being told to go home and look at old photos to jog your memory can help you remember real events, but paired with suggestions from a therapist it might also lead to false memories. Memory implantation studies are also similar to recovered memory therapy in the way that they involve an authoritative figure claiming to know that the event actually happened and applying pressure on the participant/patient to remember. Memory implantation techniques in general also illustrate how people can relatively easily come to remember things that actually never happened. This poses a big problem for criminal confessions resulting from suggestive questioning by police and others and also for the accuracy associated with eyewitness memory. It has been argued that memory implantation studies are not applicable to real life memories of trauma such as childhood sexual abuse. As it is not ethical to try to implant false memories of sexual abuse researchers have tried to get around this by choosing other events that are seen as negative but not traumatic. Being lost in a shopping mall for example would be a negative experience for most children. Hyman and colleagues used memory implantation techniques with emotional events such as a specific birthday party (positive) and being hospitalized overnight (negative). They found that using emotional events did not change the rate of false memory creation significantly compared with other studies.  Research with children  In 1998 Herrmann and Yoder published an article arguing for the cessation of memory implantation research with children. The criticisms referred to several studies investigating the suggestibility of children written by Ceci and colleagues. Herrmann and Yoer argue that the methods used can have negative implications for the children used such as lessen their respect for authority, be damaging for their concept of self (feel incompetent when it is pointed out that their memories are wrong) and cause stress. This article created much debate and several commentaries to the article were published in the same June edition of the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology together with the original article. One of these was written by Ceci, Bruck and Loftus who disagree with the statements in Herrmann and Yoder's article. According to these authors there is no evidence that any children have been harmed in a memory implantation study and until such evidence exists there is no reason to stop using these techniques with children as long as it produces good research. Ornstein and Gordon also replied to Herrmann and Yoder's article saying that although people conducting research with children have an ethical responsibility there is much to be gained from memory implantation research and the benefits outweigh the potential risk for children involved. Another commentary written by Goodman, Quas and Redlich argues that there is reason to believe that children in general enjoy participating in false memory studies and that the benefits of these studies for research into eyewitness memory are many. They also refer to several cases where memory implantation studies have been cited in court and contributed to convictions being overturned. Thompson and Jackson propose a modified version of the suggestions from Herrmann and Yoder and say that methods for being more ethically aware when doing research with children have to be developed. Also Westcott agrees with the general concerns about researchers having to take extra care when working with children. In their responding article to all the commentaries Yoder and Herrmann again question whether memory implantation research with children is necessary and conclude that ethical guidelines should be put in place by Society for Applied Research in Memory and Cognition (SARMAC). Although all the researchers involved in these commentaries from this issue of Applied Cognitive Psychology put forward different arguments, the general consensus was that doing research with children calls for extra care and the benefits from the research must outweigh potential risk to the participating children.

Located on the north bank of the Nederrijn river, between the Gelderse valley and the Veluwe, a wooded, hilly, glacial moraine, by the 12th century it was part of the Duchy of Guelders, in the Holy Roman Empire. Wageningen received its city charter from Count Otto II on June 12, 1263. Today, it is in the province of Gelderland, in east-central Netherlands.  Early settlements  Roof tiles have been found near Wageningen with the stamp of the Roman legions. However, there is no evidence of a permanent Roman encampment on the north side of the Rhine river. The Roman settlement of Vada is now thought to have been near the village of Kessel, in North Brabant province, not Wageningen. The oldest known settlement near Wageningen prior to the establishment of the city is below the bluffs and near the Nederrijn on the eastern edge of the city; near what today is known as Diedenweg (meaning Volksweg; road of the people). At the beginning of the Middle Ages the settlement moved to higher ground, what today is known as Wageningse Berg (Wageningen hill). Remains of a fieldstone chapel and wooden farmhouses have been found in that area. Between about 350 and 900, a burial site was in use around what today is the corner of Diedenweg and Geertjesweg streets. Presumably the burials came from around Wageningen and Binnenveld. The hamlet, Dolder, lay in the vicinity of what today is the intersection of Van Uvenweg, Churchillweg and Dolderstraat. Thulere was mentioned in 838, as was Brakel (Bracola), today near the intersection of Julianastraat and Van Uvenweg.  Port and fortified city  Jacob van Deventer In the 12th century a new, settlement came down from Wageningse Berg. A quay was constructed at the west edge of town, with an elevated road, the current Hoogstraat (High Street), connecting it to the base of the hill to the east. At that time, the city's first church also may haven been built. To the north of the High Street, a regular pattern of streets was established. On 12 June 1263, Wageningen was granted city rights by Count Otto II of the Duchy of Guelders. For the counts and dukes of Guelders, in addition to being a trading port, Wageningen was important as a stronghold against the Bishopric of Utrecht and later the Duchy of Burgundy. In 1526‚Äì27, Charles von Egmond, the last Duke of Guelders, gave permission for the building of a fortified castle in Wageningen. Some parts of the walled city were park-like, including the former Northpark (Noorderplantsoen) area. Castle of Wageningen (1654) The Wageningen castle was sold in 1702 by the state of Gelderland to Anna Maria Ripperda, widow of Drost (Sheriff) Assueer Torck, and mother of the last sheriff, Lubbert Adolph Torck. The Torck family demolished part of the castle and rebuilt the other part into a small city palace with a baroque garden. In 1722 Lubbert Torck Adolph married the wealthy widow Petronella van Hoorn, daughter of a governor-general of the Dutch East Indies. The previous year, he had inherited Castle Rosendael in Rozendaal, near Arnhem, from his uncle Johan van Arnhem. Torck was politically active as one of the mayors of Wageningen and in The Hague. He invested in the city, building mansions which he leased to pensioners of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and other wealthy people. One such complex, the Bassecour, existing of four houses, was acquired by the city in 1876, to attract the National Agricultural College (rijkslandsbouwschool). Wageningen had several known mills. By the Middle Ages, there were two mills on the former Molenweg, now called General Foulkesweg. The last of these mills, named de Eendracht, was demolished around 1996. Once surrounded by farmlands, the 19th century flour mill, de Vlijt continues to operate on Harnjesweg.  Nearby farms  The various neighboring settlements were organized under the same principle structure: farms around an agricultural commons, having on the east side the arable land (at the Wageningen Eng, which was much bigger) and on the west side the meadows of the Binnenveld, evenly parcellated. The Binnenveld was farmed from the 13th century. Important farms were de Stenen Kamer in Dolder (built 1597, demolished 1954), and de Tarthorst (1731) on Tarthorsterweg, now Haverlanden (demolished in 1969). Two nearby settlements, de Peppeld (near the present restaurant 't Gesprek) and Leeuwen, remain recognizable. The characteristic livestock drinking pool (kolk) is still present on both properties. Wageningen region, 1906  Educational institutions  The Landbouwhogeschool Nederland (Wageningen Agricultural College), successor to the National Agricultural and Horticultural College, was established in 1918. This was the beginning of the special development in a small, fortified city of a specialized university that has evolved today into the present the Wageningen University and Research Centre (WUR). The Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN) was founded in 1932 as the Dutch Ship Model Basin (NSMB). MARIN is a world-renowned institute in the field of maritime and hydrodynamic research. MARIN, today part of WUR, has the status of a major technological institute in the Netherlands.  World War II  The people, city, and institutions of Wageningen suffered greatly during World War II. Yet, the town is famous for its role at the end of the war. Wageningen was evacuated on May 10, 1940, as Nazi Germany invaded the country. Shortly afterwards, the central part of Wageningen was destroyed by artillery fire. Later the same month, under German occupation, residents began to clear the debris and rebuild the town center. On November 22, 1940, all Jewish staff of the Landbouwhogeschool were suspended from employment; a little over three months later, on March 1, 1941, they were forced to resign. As of October 1, 1941, Wageningen had about 15,000 residents, including about 34 Dutch Jews and about 200 Jewish refugees. By 1942, most Jews, residents and refugees alike, had been deported to meet their fate at the Sobibor and Auschwitz death camps. On May 20, 1944, the German SS carried out a wave of arrests in Wageningen of local citizens involved in the Dutch Resistance. Among those arrested were sisters, Eltien and Neeltje Krijthe, accused of hiding an illegal radio transmitter. Eltien died at Ravensbr√ºck in 1945. Major K. Henninger, a German Army Signals officer, negotiating with Canadian forces Under heavy military pressure, on April 7, 1945, retreating German forces blew up the town's church towers. Ten days later, on April 17, 1945, Wageningen was liberated from the Nazis by Allied forces. After almost five years of German occupation, on May 4, 1945, at a farm in the Nude district, on the west side of Wageningen, allied forces led by Canadian General Charles Foulkes, and the German military, under General Johannes Blaskowitz, negotiated the way the German soldiers were obliged to act after the Nazi capitulation. The talks continued the next day at the Hotel de Wereld, near the center of the city. The final agreement was signed on May 5, 1945, in de Aula, auditorium of the Agricultural College, next to de Wereld Hotel. The agreement, known as the Dutch Capitulation Act, can be regarded as an elaboration of the total capitulation of the German armed forces for northwest Europe, which also took place on May 4. The document now resides in the Wageningen town hall. On May 15, 1945, residents were allowed to return to Wageningen. Until 2005, the capitulation was commemorated annually with a grand parade of former American, British and Canadian soldiers. The Liberation Parade, a richly hued parade of veterans and war material from World War II and other conflicts, began in 2006. The Liberation Parade includes space for charities and elementary school students, as well.  Historical sites  In Wageningen, 60 objects are protected as national monuments, most in the town center. An additional 400 objects are protected as local monuments, as well.

The modern club was originally formed as Dronfield Sports Junior Football Club, before becoming Dronfield Town when they moved to the Pioneer Club ground in 1998. An adult team was established under the name Dronfield Cavaliers, but became Dronfield Town in 2001. They joined the Hope Valley Amateur League in 2001 and were B Division runners-up in 2001‚Äì02, earning promotion to the A Division. A second successive promotion was secured in 2002‚Äì03 and the Premier Division title was won at the first attempt in 2003‚Äì04. In 2005 they moved up to Division One of the Midlands Regional Alliance, which they also won at the first attempt, earning promotion to the Premier Division.Midlands Regional Alliance 2005‚Äì2013 Non-League Matters The club went on to win the Premier Division in 2007‚Äì08, and in 2009 they moved up to the Premier Division of the Central Midlands League. Dronfield's first season in the Premier Division saw them finish as runners-up, earning promotion to the Supreme Division. In 2011 league restructuring saw them placed in the North Division. They won the League Cup in 2011‚Äì12 and were North Division champions in 2012‚Äì13, resulting in promotion to Division One of the Northern Counties East League. Ground The club play at Stonelow Road in Dronfield. The ground has a covered stand and three sides of hard standing. Its capacity is 500, of which 100 is covered and 80 is seated.

The book promotes healthy eating and documents the White House Kitchen Garden through the seasons. The garden, planted in 2009 on the White House's South Lawn, was instrumental in the First Lady's Let's Move! initiative to end childhood obesity. Journalist Lyric Winik assisted Obama in the writing of American Grown and proceeds will be donated to the National Park Foundation. American Grown is divided into four sections (one for each season) and includes color photographs of vegetables, as well as recipes, instructions for making a compost bin, and stories about community gardens in the United States. The book delves into the history of gardens at the White House, including First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt's victory garden and Thomas Jefferson's attempts to grow a four-foot-long cucumber. Obama describes how the Kitchen Garden's Jefferson beds include a quote from the former president that is also a guiding principle for the garden: \\"the failure of one thing repaired by the success of another; and instead of one harvest, a continued one throughout the year.\\" American Grown, p. 26 American Grown blends the first lady's personal gardening experiences with stories from the White House Kitchen Garden.

Dominant males establish territories of about in diameter around sunken branches, rocks or pieces of travertine from where they court passing females. Displays of aggression dissuade other males from entering their territories. Females that are ready to spawn cautiously enter the dominant male's territory, showing a courtship display directed at attracting the guarding male. Mating pairs come together, swimming, swirling and waving their bodies simultaneously as the female releases single eggs which are immediately fertilized by the male. The eggs adhere to roots, aquatic vegetation, rocks, travertine or sunken objects and are abandoned to their fate.

Genetics Effective population size was evaluated in 2013 and found to be critically low, indicating that \\"this pupfish is at genetic risk of extinction through loss of adaptive variance and, potentially, from inbreeding depression.\\" Mitochondrial variation was also extremely low, and haplotype frequency was biased heavily in favor of one of two variants. The most common variant represented a divergent lineage exclusive to this pupfish; which supports recognition of Julimes pupfish as a valid and critically endangered species. Additionally, twenty-five microsatellite loci for the Julimes pupfish were screened across 19 individuals. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 14, observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.105 to 0.947, and the probability of identity values ranged from 0.022 to 0.588. Tests for deviations from Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) and for genotypic disequilibrium were conducted using GENEPOP v4.0 (Rousset 2008). After sequential Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, significant deviation from HWE expectations was observed at five loci. all locus-pairs conformed to expectations of genotypic equilibrium.Carson, E.W., R.

With support from partner NGOs, including Pronatura Noreste, A.C., Biodesert A.C., Profauna A.C. and the WWF-Chihuahuan Desert Program, \\"Amigos del Pande√±o\\" began an Integrated Spring Management Program which seeks an optimal allocation of spring flows, recognizing the environment ‚Äî and consequently the Julimes pupfish ‚Äî as a user. The Program seeks to implement adaptive management strategies, build local capacities, generate water savings by upgrading irrigation systems, promote environmental education and develop public outreach, and intervene in water policy towards the implementation of environmental flows.

The next week he made his first appearance in the starting side, playing at five-eighth and scoring a try. Coach Tim Sheens said of him, \\"I've been trying to hide him as long as I can. There's no doubt he's a first grader.\\" Sironen is the first son of a former Balmain or Wests player to get a run for Wests Tigers. Having established himself as the team five-eighth outside Benji Marshall, Sironen had played 6 games when he was injured. Coach Tim Sheens said, \\"Young Curtis will be out for the season and we're pretty sure he'll need another reconstruction. When you throw your arm out like he did and the guy's going in another direction, even with a good shoulder you can suffer a dislocation.\\" Despite playing just 6 games for the year, he was named the club's joint Rookie of the Year. 2013 Returning from injury in round 6 of 2013, Sironen was initially chosen in the halves. After only one game, Sironen was a late selection (after Josh Reynolds withdrew) to play for City in the annual City vs Country Origin match. He was the third least experienced player to ever appear in the match. Later in the season, Braith Anasta was moved to five-eighth and Sironen played in the second-row. In the last 4 games of the year, Sironen scored a try in 3 games. 2014 After an injury-hampered 2014, where he was limited to 13 games, Sironen underwent shoulder surgery in the off-season. 2015 He played in the first 11 rounds of 2015 before undergoing neck surgery. Returning to first grade in July, he made 19 appearances for the season. Mostly playing in the second row, he was on the field for a full 80 minutes in 15 games. On 31 October 2015, Sironen needed to delete his Twitter account in the wake of a media story which arose that involved Sironen's former partner. According to reports, Sironen's ex-partner hacked into his Twitter account and posted a naked photo of him with another woman with the caption \\"I make excuses this is why my girlfriend who is tattooed on my arm left me\\". After the story was aired in the media Sironen tried to downplay the incident.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/wests-tiger- curtis-sironen-seemingly-outed-on-twitter-for-cheating-20151031-gknjxb.html 2016 Sironen played the opening two games of the season in the second row, before missing three with injury. Soon after his return, he was chosen in the City side for the third time. Sironen said, \\"As someone who wants State of Origin honours in the future this is one of the stepping stones. Earlier this season I had a hamstring niggle. I've just been trying to get my body healthy and play for the Tigers, I'm just worrying about that before anything else. If I can put all the drama aside I'll be able to one day achieve the goals I've set myself.\\" In November 2016 it was reported that Sironen would opt out of his contract so he could join the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles for 2 seasons starting in 2017. In the wake of Sironen leaving The Wests Tigers, his father Paul slammed coach Jason Taylor in the media as he claimed that Taylor was leaving his son out of the first grade side on purpose. After Taylor was terminated, Paul Sironen said \\"He punted me then got rid of my young bloke last year, Well, karma's a bitch, Good riddance & don't let the door hit you on the way out!\\".https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/good-riddance-wests-tigers- legend-paul-sironen-delivers-withering-sendoff-to-jason- taylor-20170320-gv2ghg.html 2017 On 4 May 2017, Sironen was placed under investigation by The NRL for an incident involving his former partner and the woman he had an affair with at a Balmain pub. It was alleged that Sironen smashed the door of a women's toilet because his former partner was spending far too long in the woman's cubicle with the woman he was cheated with. Witnesses said they had seen Sironen leave bleeding heavily from his hand and he was photographed two days later at training with his hand wrapped in a bandage.https://wwos.nine.com.au/2017/05/04/19/33/manly-sea-eagles-player- curtis-sironen-under-investigation-over-incident-in-balmain- pubhttp://www.sportingnews.com/au/league/news/sironen-in-trouble-after- weekend-pub-incident-manly-sea-eagles/1piyqampdjz791s6npzyjxzf72 In the 2017 season, Sironen suffered a torn pectoral muscle in Round 14 and was ruled out for 12 weeks.

It stars Andy Serkis, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Keri Russell, Toby Kebbell, and Kodi Smit-McPhee. It is the sequel to the 2011 film Rise of the Planet of the Apes, which began 20th Century Fox's reboot of the Planet of the Apes series. Dawn is set 10 years after the events of Rise, and follows a group of people in San Francisco who struggle to stay alive in the aftermath of a plague that wiped out most of humanity, while Caesar tries to maintain dominance over his community of intelligent apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was released in the United States on July 11, 2014 and was met with highly positive reviews, with critics praising its visual effects, story, direction, acting, musical score, action sequences and emotional depth. It was also a box office success, grossing over $710 million worldwide against a $170 million budget, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2014 and the highest-grossing film in the series. The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for eight Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director for Reeves, and Best Supporting Actor for Serkis.https://www.awn.com/news/interstellar-winter- soldier-lead-2015-saturn-award-noms A sequel, titled War for the Planet of the Apes, was released on July 14, 2017. Plot Ten years after the global pandemic of a deadly Simian Flu, the worldwide human population has been drastically reduced, with only about one in 500 genetically immune. Civilization is destroyed from the result of societal collapse. The apes, under the chimpanzee Caesar, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, have long-established a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco. A group of humans, led by a man named Malcolm, trespass the apes' territory from San Francisco in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to the city. An encounter by Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash leads to the latter's injury by a man named Carver. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo who holds a personal grudge against humans for his mistreatment as a laboratory test subject, Caesar brings his army to the humans' community as a display of strength. Caesar announces to the community that while the apes do not want war, he intends to fight the humans if he is forced to, while demanding the humans stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest and reconcile with the apes so they can access the dam. He meets with Caesar, who allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. The fragile bonding is greatly helped when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness. Dreyfus arms his community using the Fort Point armory. Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response, but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory and takes an assault rifle, killing two guards, and then Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator and restoring power to the city. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush below, and frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death in order to wage war. Koba quickly takes command and leads the ape army into San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the human settlement. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Koba's orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba throws the ape to his death and has any other ape who is loyal to Caesar imprisoned, including Maurice, Luca, and Rocket. Malcolm's family finds severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. When Malcolm sneaks back into the settlement to find medical supplies for Caesar, he encounters Blue Eyes, who spares him before learning that his father is still alive and accompanies Malcolm to find him. Caesar reveals that it was Koba who shot him, not the humans, and confesses that apes can be as corrupt and violent as humans. After reconciling with Caesar, Blue Eyes returns to the tower and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. Malcolm escorts the apes into the tower and then finds Dreyfus. He learns that the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with survivors from a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus, who has initiated a suicide mission, detonates C-4 charges that destabilize the tower in a failed attempt to kill the apes. Koba starts angrily shooting at the apes, but Caesar tackles him off a ledge. While clinging on a metal girder, Koba is disowned as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death. Malcolm and Caesar acknowledge their friendship, with Malcolm warning of the approaching human military. Caesar responds that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack and convinces Malcolm to leave with his family. He then stands before a kneeling mass of apes, preparing for the upcoming war.

To me, I can think of all sorts of sequels to this film, but this is just the beginning.\\" Screenwriter and producer Rick Jaffa also stated that Rise featured several clues as to future sequels: \\"I hope that we're building a platform for future films. We're trying to plant a lot of the seeds for a lot of the things you are talking about in terms of the different apes and so forth.\\" In an interview recorded after the release of Rise, Wyatt stated, \\"We want to grow and evolve, in the films that will [hopefully] come after this, to the '68 original.\\" Wyatt also stated that he wants it to take place eight years after Rise, as a whole new ape generation can be born, and explore the dynamics of Caesar and Koba's relationship. According to screenwriter Rick Jaffa, a version of the spaceship from the 1968 Planet of the Apes under the name Icarus was in Rise as a deliberate hint to a possible sequel. In November 2011, Andy Serkis was the first to be announced as having closed a deal for a sequel to Rise. It was reported to be a \\"healthy seven-figure deal\\" for him to reprise his role as Caesar, the ape leader. On May 15, 2012, it was announced Scott Z. Burns had been hired to do rewrites on the original screenplay by Rise writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. On May 31, 2012, 20th Century Fox announced that the sequel would be titled Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Post-production On September 17, 2012, there were reports that director Wyatt was considering leaving the sequel due to his concern that a May 2014 release date would not give him enough time to make the film properly. On October 1, Cloverfield director Matt Reeves was confirmed as his replacement. Reeves had been working on developing a new Twilight Zone film. On October 18, Mark Bomback, writer of Live Free or Die Hard, was reported to be doing a re-write for Reeves. Casting In December 2012, after the departure of director Wyatt, James Franco speculated that he would not be returning for the sequel, saying, \\"Now Rupert's not a part of it so I don't know. My guess is I won't be in it. Nobody's talked to me since Rupert left.\\" Freida Pinto, who played primatologist Caroline Aranha in Rise, confirmed that she would not be returning for Dawn. In April 2014, when asked by IGN about the fate of Franco and Pinto's characters, producer Dylan Clark said, \\"I mean, they‚Äôre the ones that died...They were ground zero of the virus.\\" In February 2013, actors Gary Oldman, Jason Clarke, and Kodi Smit-McPhee were cast in lead roles for the sequel, set ten years after the events from the first film. In March 2013, actress Keri Russell was cast in a role. That same month, Judy Greer was cast as Cornelia, a female chimp and love interest for Caesar. Toby Kebbell, Enrique Murciano and Kirk Acevedo joined the cast during filming. On May 15, 2013, Jocko Sims was cast in a supporting role of military operative Werner. Filming Filming began in April 2013 around the town of Campbell River, British Columbia. The location of Vancouver Island was chosen for its similarity to the locations depicted in the film, the forests, and the variety of landscapes. Filming in New Orleans started in May 2013 and continued in July 2013 at various locations such as the former Six Flags park Six Flags New Orleans. Visual effects Like Rise, visual effects for Dawn were done by Weta Digital. In addition to the apes, Weta created other digital animals, such as a herd of elk, a grizzly bear, and CG doubles of the live horses. The elk were created using key-frame animation and the digital crowd enhancement software MASSIVE, the bear through key-frame animation, and the horses with a mixture of key-frame animation and motion capture. Soundtrack The film's score was composed by Michael Giacchino. The soundtrack was released by Sony Masterworks on July 8, 2014. ; Track listing Release On May 31, 2012, Fox announced that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was scheduled for release on May 23, 2014. However, it was announced on June 20, 2013 that the release date for Dawn was being pushed back two months to July 18, 2014. On December 10, 2013, the film was pushed up one week to July 11, 2014. The film premiered at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, California on June 26, 2014. The film closed the 36th Moscow International Film Festival on June 28. In Hungary, the largest cinema chain called Cinema City could not agree with the film's distributor, InterCom, and as a result it opened on July 17, 2014 on 45 screens, significantly fewer than similar big-budget productions. However, the film still managed to top the weekend box office chart of the country beating Transformers: Age of Extinction, which had been leading the chart for three weeks (on 105 screens distributed by UIP Duna). Marketing A viral marketing campaign for the film launched in July 2013 included a \\"simian flu\\" website and mock PSA videos. 20th Century Fox and Vice Media's Motherboard released three short films online in July 2014 which document the ten-year gap between the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A novel titled Dawn of the Planet of the Apes: Firestorm which is also set between the events of the first two films was published in May 2014 by Titan Books. A partnership with 20th Century Fox and Ndemic Creations saw mobile/PC game Plague Inc. get a Dawn of the Planet of the Apes-themed update on July 10, 2014. It allows players to create and customize a simian flu virus to infect the world and eradicate humanity whilst helping apes survive. Reception=Box office Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was a success at the box office with many critics calling it \\"the summer's best popcorn film\\", and Deadline Hollywood commented saying it is \\"a franchise that will keep going and going, unless they screw it up\\". The film grossed $208,545,589 in the United States and Canada, and $500,290,000 in other countries, for a worldwide total of $708,835,589. Calculating in all expenses and revenues, Deadline Hollywood estimated that the film made a net profit of $182.18 million. It had a worldwide opening of $103.3 million which was the 11th- highest of 2014. Worldwide it is the highest-grossing film in the Planet of the Apes franchise and the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2014. In the United States and Canada, the film is the highest-grossing film in the Planet of the Apes franchise, unadjusted for inflation and the eighth-highest-grossing film of 2014. It opened on July 11, 2014 across 3,967 theaters and topped the box office on its opening day earning $27.7 million (including previews). During its traditional three-day opening, the film debuted at number one earning $72.6 million, which was 33% higher than its predecessor. Box Office Mojo pointed out that the film's good word of mouth as well as its predecessors', its darker tone, attachment of new characters and the first film's way of ending were all determining factors in the film's strong opening. It remained at the summit for two consecutive weekends in North America despite facing competition with The Purge: Anarchy in its second week. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes earned $31.3 million during its opening weekend internationally from 4,913 screens in 26 markets, where it opened at No. 1 in 14 of those. International opening weekend tallies of more than $5 million were witnessed in the UK ($14.88 million), Mexico ($12.94 million), South Korea ($11.5 million), Russia ($9.99 million), Brazil with ($9.2 million) and Australia ($6.6 million). The film topped the box office outside North America for two non-consecutive weekends. The film became a massive financial success in China, where it opened with $47 million on its opening weekend there. The robust debut helped the film top the international charts for the first time dethroning Guardians of the Galaxy and aided the film in passing $400 million internationally and $600 million globally. Fox reported that the sequel's debut in China was one of the best in history for a Western title, save for Iron Man 3, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Transformers: Age of Extinction at that time. After playing for a month in theaters, it passed $100 million on its fourth weekend and became the fourth Hollywood film of the year to achieve such a milestone. In total, it went on to make $107.4 million there, of which the studio received $26.8 million profit. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 313 reviews, with an average rating of 7.90/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"With intelligence and emotional resonance to match its stunning special effects, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes expands on its predecessor with an exciting and ambitious burst of sci-fi achievement.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 79 out of 100 based on 48 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Guy Lodge of Variety said, \\"An altogether smashing sequel to 2011's better-than-expected Rise of the Planet of the Apes, this vivid, violent extension of humanoid ape Caesar's troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department, with incoming helmer Matt Reeves conducting the proceedings with more assertive genre elan than Rise journeyman Rupert Wyatt.\\" Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter stated that the film \\"manages to do at least three things exceptionally well that are hard enough to pull off individually: Maintain a simmering level of tension without let-up for two hours, seriously improve on a very good first entry in a franchise and produce a powerful humanistic statement using a significantly simian cast of characters. In the annals of sequels, Dawn is to Rise of the Planet of the Apes what The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars‚Äîit's that much better.\\" Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said, \\"There's evident patience and intelligence to the filmmaking all over, as well as an engagement with genuine ideas about diplomacy, deterrence, law and leadership. However often it risks monkey-mad silliness, it's impressively un-stupid.\\" Drew McWeeny of HitFix awarded the film an \\"A+\\" grade and said \\"Dawn is not just a good genre movie or a good summer movie. It's a great science-fiction film, full-stop, and one of the year's very best movies so far.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"in bearing, speech, and agonized expressiveness, Serkis's Caesar conveys the conflicts of a king with almost Shakespearean grandeur.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times praised the film for being able to balance out the action sequences and special effects with strong storytelling, writing that \\"Dawn is more than a bunch of occasionally thrilling action sequences, emotional gut punches and throwaway jokes arranged in predictable sequence. It is technically impressive and viscerally exciting, for sure, but it also gives you a lot to think, and even to care, about.\\" Less favorable reviews included Andrew O'Hehir at Salon.com who wrote, \\"Here's a rule that has gradually become clear to me: Any film that begins with one of those fake-news montages, where snippets of genuine CNN footage are stitched together to concoct a feeling of semi-urgency around its hackneyed apocalypse, already sucks even before it gets started. This one makes a dutiful attempt to struggle back from that suckage, but it all ends in yelling.\\" Home media Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, and DVD on December 2, 2014. According to Nielsen VideoScan, it subsequently became the best-selling home video release for the week. Accolades=Sequel After seeing his cut of Dawn, 20th Century Fox and Chernin Entertainment signed Matt Reeves to return as director for a third installment of the reboot series. On January 6, 2014, Fox announced Reeves to direct as well as co-write along with Bomback, with a planned July 2016 release. Peter Chernin, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver will produce.

History  The site was inhabited by Coast Salish people beginning at least 4,000 years ago, until about 200 years ago, with the arrival of smallpox on the Northwest Coast. During that time it was a village known as cÃì…ôsna î…ôm. According to BC Heritage Industry Canada site, the Marpole Culture Type dates between 2400 BP and 1600 years BP. In 1884 the midden was unearthed during the upgrading of Garypie Farm Road, and was the site of archaeological excavation throughout the subsequent decades. In 1892, Charles Hill-Tout did extensive excavations at the site for the Art, Historical, and Scientific Association of Vancouver, stimulating study of other middens in the region.Marpole Midden National Historic Site, CanadaHistory.ca website page American Museum of Natural History archaeologist, Harlan Ingersoll Smith, participating in the Jessup North Pacific Expedition from 1897 to 1899, mined the Marpole site for skeletal remains. In the 1950s and 1960s UBC professor Charles Edward Borden undertook salvage archaeology projects at the site. Borden \\"was the first to draw links between contemporary Musqueam peoples and excavated remains.\\" The construction of the Fraser Arms Hotel in the 1950s destroyed much of the site. On May 25, 1933, the Marpole Midden was recognized as a National Historic Site of Canada, although the historic marker is located in nearby Marpole Park, while the midden itself is located a few blocks away, between Montcalm and Milton streets, south of Marine Drive.  Condo development controversy and protests  In December 2011, a development permit was issued for the construction of a 108-unit condominium project. Intact remains were found in January 2012 during an archaeological dig as required by the permit. In March 2012, members disrupted planned digging, claiming there was no consultation prior to the permit being issued in December, and in protest over the continued lack of dialogue. There was a cooling-off period while waiting for negotiations to occur, but protesters returned to the site because, in their opinion, there had been no meaningful progress. Musqueam Band members and the supporters of the Musqueam band staged a series of protests to raise awareness about the site in May 2012. These included a rally at Mountain View Cemetery on May 29, and a blockade of the Arthur Laing Bridge between Richmond and Vancouver on May 31. On September 27, 2012 Musqueam received the Province of B.C.‚Äôs decision regarding the permits issued by the Province under the Heritage Conservation Act to permit a 5 story condominium development at cÃì…ôsna î…ôm, also known as the Musqueam Marpole Village Site. As recognized in the decision, this site was declared to be a National Historic Site in 1933 as one of the largest pre-contact middens in Western Canada and has special significance for Musqueam. Musqueam is pleased that the proposed development is no longer authorized by the permits issued by the Province and that the ancestral remains are to be restored to their original condition. Their disturbance caused great anguish to the community and the proposed development would have desecrated an ancient and sacred burial place and destroyed a site precious to the Musqueam as representing one of the few links to our heritage extending back thousands of years. It would also have destroyed a Canadian historic site and a heritage site that should be protected for all British Columbians. Musqueam looks forward to being actively involved in the steps to be taken to restore the ancestral remains in accordance with Musqueam customs and beliefs, steps that must be taken immediately to prevent further deterioration. The Musqueam people have purchased the property.

His father was al-HƒÅƒüƒü Habƒ´b, the son of Ba≈°ƒ´r, a native of W√§lqayet in T…ôgray, who migrated to Qallu ‚Äúseeking knowledge‚Äù (talab al-‚Äòilm). Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´‚Äôs mother was W√§yz√§ro FƒÅtuma Malik. When Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ was four years old, his father went to T…ôgray and then to Asm√§ra where he stayed for more than twenty years. Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ married KubrƒÅ bt. Sheikh Sa‚Äòƒ´d Mans≈´r of W√§rr√§ Him√§no who bore him six sons: Muhammad N≈´r, ‚ÄòAbd al-RahmƒÅn, Husayn, Ba≈°ƒ´r, Ahmad and Hasan, and two daughters, Maryam and Rahma.  Biography = Islamic Education  Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´‚Äôs first Qur‚ÄôƒÅn teachers were Sheikh Muftƒ´ b. IbrƒÅhƒ´m of W√§rr√§ Babbo and Ahmad Mahallƒ´ of Ala≈°≈°a in W√§rr√§ Him√§no, who were then the students of al-HƒÅƒüƒü Ahmad b. Ba≈°ƒ´r of Qallu (d.9 June 1948). He studied the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn, fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), tafsƒ´r (exegesis), mantiq (logic), us≈´l (fundamentals [of jurisprudence]), hadƒ´t and balƒÅƒ°a (rhetoric) under several ‚ÄòulamƒÅ‚Äô. At the age of 23, after completing the study of Alfiyya (KitƒÅb alkhulƒÅsa al-alfiya, a r√©sum√© of al-kƒÅfiya by Muhammad ibn MƒÅlik [1203/3-1274], he went to Asm√§ra in search of his father and returned with him after a year. It was in the same year that he set out for the pilgrimage. After completing his religious education in 1937 (1944/45), he taught for many years at mosques and Islamic schools first in Dessie, W√§llo and then in Massawa in Eritrea. The Arabic version of the account of his life partly confirms and partly contradicts some facts in the Amharic one as well as providing pieces of additional information in the latter: at the age of seven, he studied the Qur'an under Muftƒ´ b. IbrƒÅhƒ´m and Ahmad LƒÅ≈°ƒ´ for four years. He also studied other subjects, especially fiqh according to the Hanafƒ´ madhab, under al-HƒÅƒüƒü Ahmad of Qallu, and nahw (Arabic grammar and syntax) and sarf (morphology) under Sheikh K√§mm√§l√§w b. Muhammad (d. A.H.13 D≈´‚ÄôlHiƒüƒüa 1367/6 Teqemt 1941 E.C./18 October 1948).  Journey to Mecca  In A.H. 1357/1938-39 he left for Mecca to perform the pilgrimage. However, on his way to Mecca, he (and his colleague, Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅƒüaddƒ´n) stopped at Harqiqo near Massawa where the Muslim elders of the town, in recognition of his erudition and piety, offered him the position of imƒÅm of the Mƒ´rƒ°anƒ´ Mosque which he accepted. He served in that capacity for several years. Subsequently, he traveled to Mecca and performed the haƒüƒü. On his return to W√§llo, Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ studied ‚ÄòƒÄlƒÅ‚Äô al-Dƒ´n al-Haskafƒ´'s Durr al-MuhtƒÅr ≈°arh tanwƒ´r al- absƒÅr (a textbook of Hanafƒ´ fiqh) under al-HƒÅƒüƒü Ahmad of Qallu. This was the second time for him to be tutored by the renowned master of fiqh. On the completion of his studies, he received an iƒüƒÅza. Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ and his lifelong colleague traveled to Albukko to pursue their higher Islamic studies under Sheikh Ahmad Nure, and mastered six subjects: tafsƒ´r, balƒÅƒ°a, mantiq, ‚Äòar≈´d, tawhƒ´d and us≈´l al-fiqh. Sheikh Ahmad also granted Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ iƒüƒÅza. From 1951 (1958/59) to 1967 (1974/75), he taught a basic course on Islam to Muslim students at the W√§yz√§ro Sehin Comprehensive Secondary School in Dessie, and was selected as one of the co-translators of the Holy Qur'an on the orders of Emperor Haile Sellassie I. In 1967 E.C. he moved to the capital to start work on the translation of the Qur'an. From 1969 (1976/78) to 1971 (1978/79) he taught at the D√§ƒüƒüazmaƒç ‚ÄòUmar S√§m√§t√§r School located within the premises of the Anwar Mosque and became deputy imƒÅm, (and in 1971 imƒÅm and hatƒ´b [deliverer of the Friday sermon] of the mosque]). He also privately taught hadƒ´t, balƒÅƒ°a, tafsƒ´r and mantiq to advanced students at his home.  Key Roles for the Muslim Community  After the outbreak of the revolution, Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ became the founding chairman of the Maƒülis (Ethiopian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs), a member of the central committee of the national literacy campaign, the relief coordination committee and several other national committees. In early M√§sk√§r√§m 1967, he led a Muslim delegation to, and had an audience with, Lt. Colonel Aman Mika‚Äô√©l Andom, chairman of the D√§rg, and on behalf of Ethiopian Muslims, he expressed support for the ongoing changes. On the occasion of the first official celebration of ‚Äòƒ™d al-Fitr, he reiterated such support and made a reference to the fact that in the past, a delegation representing the Muslim residents of Addis Ababa used to go to the imperial palace twice annually after the two ‚Äòƒ™d prayers in order to express their good wishes to the emperor on the occasion of the celebration of the Islamic festivals. He noted that after the revolution, they were allowed to celebrate the festival within the premises of the principal mosque in the presence of senior government officials. He also alluded to the fact that Ethiopian Muslims had long been prevented from taking part in national affairs and discriminated against in education, administration and the army. Finally, he called upon the government to grant land for the construction of a new mosque in the capital. In the succeeding years he was elected as a member of the national ≈†√§ngo (parliament). He attended many international conferences (including one on world peace and disarmament/d√©tente held the USSR), Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Libya, Algeria and other countries. He also took part in an interreligious seminar organized by the government and held from 28 to 30 March 1978 at which he ‚Äú...expressed appreciation of the fact that Islam had been placed on an equal footing with other religions in Ethiopia.‚Äù Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ played a crucial role in facilitating the construction of mosques in and outside Addis Ab√§ba, and the establishment and expansion of orphanages by personally endorsing applications for financial and material assistance submitted to him, and approaching Ethiopian Muslim and foreign philanthropists and organizations. Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´‚Äôs contribution to public and community service was as impressive and outstanding as his accomplishments in Islamic religious scholarship and preaching. He played an active role in transforming the Anwar Mosque from a venue for only formal ritual services into a centre of a vigorous, organized and vibrant social, intellectual and spiritual life and of theological and legal discourse based on consensus, tolerance and legitimacy of diversity and dissent, thereby setting a trend for, and impacting, the wider Muslim community in the country at large. orphanages by personally endorsing applications for financial and material assistance submitted to him, and approaching Ethiopian Muslim and foreign philanthropists and organizations.  Publications  Besides co- translating the Qur‚ÄôƒÅn (with Sheikh Sayed Muhammad Sadiq), Sheikh al-HƒÅƒüƒü Muhamamd TƒÅnƒ´ was the author of the first full-length Amharic biography of the Prophet Muhammad as well as a short introduction (in the form of questions and answers) to the rituals of the greater pilgrimage (haƒüƒü) and the lesser pilgrimage (‚Äòumra), the latter published posthumously. He also contributed an article in Amharic entitled ‚ÄúM√§lkam Ar‚Äôaya‚Äù to the W√§yz√§ro Sehin Secondary School magazine, M√§sk√§r√§m (1956 E.C.). An analysis of the contents of the article clearly reveals his grasp of the crucial importance of modern education. He noted that the awareness of the people about the value and benefits of education was limited and that in the past parents had to be persuaded through various incentives to send their children to school. However, after it was realized that ‚Äúeducation was as essential as food and air,‚Äù the public demand for the establishment of schools increased. Besides, the government was unable to meet the growing demand. The author then analyzed the situation in the town of Dessie by pointing out that there were only one secondary and three elementary schools, and an Islamic school financed by the Muslim community, in addition to some schools run by the Ethiopian Orthodox church and the Catholic missionaries. But in relation to the public demand and the size of the student population, the number of the existing schools is far from adequate. Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ then discussed the problems that students from the rural areas faced in towns one of which was insufficient government stipends which were given only to students who scored high marks (those from the countryside could not achieve this). As a result, many poor students attended classes in conditions of hardship. Since all students of grades seven and eight went to the high school, those coming from remote districts such as Tita, Q√§l√§m Meda, S√§yyo, G√§rado and Ruga had to leave their homes very early in the morning, often without taking breakfast, and arrived at school late. At the end of the morning shift, they stayed in the school compound with no lunch. In the afternoon, while the other students living in the town returned to school after relaxing in their homes, those from the countryside, attended classes on empty stomach, and trekked back to their villages where they reached after dark. In order to solve this problem, the teachers of the high school contributed money to prepare lunch for the students from the countryside. The coordinator was an American called Kilhefner. In 1955 E.C. (1962/63) a committee was set up for that purpose. That year (1956 E.C.), between 70 and 80 students were assisted by the committee. They were engaged in the work of cleaning up the school compound and gardening, fetching firewood and washing of utensils. Finally, the writer made a strong appeal to people and organizations to assist the poor students.  Death  Following a long illness, Sheikh Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ was admitted into the Black Lion hospital on A.H. 01 RamadƒÅn 1409/6 April 1989). After three weeks of treatment, he died at 2:15 p.m. on Friday 23 RamadƒÅn/10 Miyazya 1981 E.C./ 28 April 1989. His funeral was attended by an estimated crowd of 300,000 people including the patriarch, Abun√§ M√§rqor√©wos, T√§f√§rra W√§nd√©, deputy prime minister and member of the central committee of the Workers Party of Ethiopia (WPE), and other senior Ethiopian government officials, leaders of other religious communities, ambassadors, representatives of international organizations, colleagues, friends and family members. He was buried at the Kolfe Muslim cemetery in Addis Ab√§ba. Both at the time of his death and after the end of the period of mourning, many people openly admitted that Sheikh al-HƒÅƒüƒü Muhammad TƒÅnƒ´ was irreplaceable, but they soon reconciled themselves to that eventuality as readily as they had accepted the reality of his demise. The author of his brief Arabic biography composed the following lines about the symbolic significance and actual impact of his life and death: laqad mƒÅta tawd al-‚Äòilm wa‚Äôl-hilm wa‚Äôl-tuqƒÅ wa azlama arƒüƒÅ‚Äô al-nawƒÅhƒ´ bifaqdihi wasƒÅlat dumu‚Äò al-≈°a‚Äòb ka‚Äôl-ƒ°ayt al-hƒÅtil imƒÅm usiba al-qawm tarran bimawtihi liyabkƒ´h masƒüid fƒ´ yawm wa fƒ´‚Äôl-layl litabkƒ´h jum‚Äòat wahutbatuhu al-ahlƒÅ liyabkƒ´h tafsƒ´r bidam‚Äòihi al- hƒÅtil watabkƒ´h ƒ°urfat wamaktab maƒülis walaƒünat da‚Äòwat fƒ´ kulli al-asƒÅ‚Äôil Indeed, died the mountain of knowledge, forbearance and devoutness His absence darkened all the directions of the horizon The tears of people poured down like heavy rain [He] was the imƒÅm by whose death people were much aggrieved Let the mosque weep day and night Let Friday and his sweet sermon weep Let the exegesis shed its tears Let the room and office of the Maƒülis weep And the committee of the da‚Äòwa in every place He concluded: ‚Äúwa ammƒÅ dakƒÅ‚Äôihi wa ‚Äòilmihi fahuwa bahr qa‚Äòruhu ‚Äòamƒ´q.‚Äù (As for his intelligence, cleverness and knowledge, it is [like] a sea whose depth is profound.‚Äù)  References  *Addis Z√§m√§n. 22 Miyazya 1981 E.C.

He was the son of a farmer Arnt L√∏vset (1873‚Äì1938) and Helle Hove (1870‚Äì1911), married Selma Margaret Nilsen (1894‚Äì1986) in 1924, divorced 1950, and married again in 1951 with the nurse Aslaug Tordis Gil (1921‚Äì1976). Education L√∏vset graduated with examen artium in 1916, then studied medicine at the University of Christiania and was MD in 1924. After some years in private practice and many years as a hospital doctor, he defended dr.med. degree work Somatische Konstitutionsz√ºge und Ihre Beziehungen zur Geburt des Kinder in 1940. Career After the candidate service L√∏vset came to Orkanger as practitioner for four years. He started his hospital career in 1929, and visited several specialized departments before concentrating on obstetrics and gynecology, with education positions at three of the largest Norwegian institutions in the subject: Rikshospitalets Kvinneklinikk in Oslo, Oslo Municipal Kvinneklinikk and the Kvinneklinikken at Haukeland sykehus. In 1931 he returned to Bergen as a registrar at Kvinneklinikken. L√∏vset was at Haukeland sykehus in barely four years before for more education side of Oslo was reserve physician at Women's Clinic, National Hospital, in the years 1936-1940.In 1940 he became physician at the Kvinneklinikken, Haukeland sykehus, the same year he defended dr.med. degree. L√∏vset wrote several books, including a textbook for midwives. The last internationally known law book published was in 1968, a health teaching for pregnant women and mothers and a monograph on vaginal delivery. When the University of Bergen was opened in 1946, L√∏vset became professor there. In 1950 he encouraged Astrid Kruse Andersen to work at Kvinneklinikken in Bergen to start up with pregnancy and postnatal exercise as they were the first institution in Norway that offered. He was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Bergen from 1952 to 1957 and the university's vice rector from 1954 to 1957. L√∏vset was one of the pioneers of gynecology and obstetrics, and after Christian Kielland (1871‚Äì1941), the best-known Norwegian gynecologist internationally. He constructed new and improved old instruments and developed techniques to safer delivery in difficult situations, especially for fetuses that were born in the breech. He was involved in the changes in obstetrics where it went from being primarily a subject og fetal delivery with emphasis on the mechanics of birth, to be more similar to other medical disciplines. It was possible to bypass the narrow pelvis and birth obstructions by caesarean section, as in sing time as chief of Bergen no longer always a dangerous choice. Still rare, but increasingly became the first choice. Birth Council was to change the character. The technique in difficult vaginal delivery was through the centuries continually enhanced with new manual and instrumental methods. Christian Kielland's birth in 1915, Rod was a Norwegian contributions that were spread around the world. J√∏rgen Act continued this tradition. He never settled down with the existing methods were good enough. With thorough knowledge of the dynamics of birth and great constructive imagination he made instruments and describe techniques that have been left. His name is known worldwide for a new way to release the child's shoulders at the breech birth (L√∏vset's manoeuvre), which he published in 1936.L√∏vset (1936) The method is described in all textbooks and remains the standard method in Norway at the vaginal birth of children in the breech. In 1932 L√∏vset designed an umbilical clamp made of aluminum, complete with seaweed, which later was used for all births in Norway for at least 50 years. Now use a rubber band, which is cheaper, but hardly better. 1933 he made an instrument to the gradual enlargement of the cervix before the abortion, to prevent damage during the procedure. This was used in nearly 40 years, until it was drugs (prostaglandins) that had the same effect. L√∏vset did pioneering work in artificial insemination of infertility. In 1939 he started the insemination of donor sperm to women who were married to infertile men. He presented the results of this in an international journal in 1951 and a Norwegian publication, 1952.L√∏vset (1951) The author Aksel Sandemose criticized such anonymous insemination in a harsh article in his magazine, √Örstidene (the seasons), but L√∏vset defended his method in 1953. Many Norwegian gynecologists received special education under L√∏vsets management at the Kvinneklinikken in Bergen. There are many testimonies from the time of positive influences and the L√∏vset as set by his calm, determination and skill. He also wrote textbooks on obstetrics and health teaching for pregnant women.

Longfellow with the title The Gleaner of Sapri. Mercantini is also known for writing the lyrics of the patriotic hymn Canzone Italiana, better known as the Garibaldi Hymn, since it was commissioned in 1858 by Garibaldi himself to the poet, as the official battle song of his \\"Cacciatori delle Alpi\\" volunteer corps who joined in the Second Italian War of Independence the following year. The hymn's music was composed by his musician friend Alessio Olivieri, and proved hugely popular among Italians at home and abroad, famously being recorded by Enrico Caruso around the outbreak of World War I and again used as battle hymn of some brigades of the Italian resistance movement during World War II.

Zombies!!) is a 2007 zombie comedy film directed by Matthew Kohnen and starring Matthew Davis, Julianna Robinson, and Michael Grant Terry.Distributor's site with background information The events of the plot take place from the zombies' point of view. The film uses color footage to show the action from the zombies point of view in which they see themselves as normal humans and occasionally switches to black-and-white footage to show the zombies from the point of view of normal humans.  Plot  In a recording, a military experiment tests Serum XT1258 on a soldier, only to have him turn into a zombie and attack the surgeons. The remainder of the serum is transported away for disposal. However, the soldiers become lost and while they fight over the map, they accidentally run over somebody that had been following them. One of the serum barrels falls out, rolls away, and leaks behind a bowling arcade, contaminating ice cream. Tim, an employee, eats it with his friends: Mike, his crush Cindy, and Vanessa, Mike's ex-girlfriend. All pass out and reanimate into zombies; however they still see themselves as humans. Cindy gets a stomachache, and Vanessa and Tim are unable to call an ambulance because the phone operator speaks and hangs up too fast ‚Äì everything in the normal world is sped up to zombies ‚Äì but they simply dismiss it as faulty connections. When they go outside to look for help, they bump into Nick, a military private who joins them to look for a working phone. When they stumble into a bar and are attacked by its patrons, they exhibit abnormal symptoms, such as increased strength and endurance. Nick then tells them about the serum, and he reveals he was also exposed to it. Nick suspects it has infected most of the population and the five of them are immune because all of them were infected while consuming dairy products, which might have neutralized the serum's toxins. Convinced the military will hunt them down to cover up the incident, Nick proposes they stay together to ensure their safety. Nick unsuccessfully spies on Colonel South and Dr. Richter, the people responsible for the experiment, and later goes off to steal information about the serum. Cindy and Tim check on Cindy's family while Vanessa and Mike hurry for Vanessa's job interview. Tim accidentally kills Cindy's parents when they throw dynamite at him while he asks for their permission to see her, only for him to throw it back before it explodes. Vanessa presumably kills her would-be employer when she unintentionally scares him into his bedroom and catches him hiding under the bed. Meanwhile, Nick is captured and has his brain waves sped up to understand humans again. Colonel South then reveals the military is planning to eradicate the infected people. After he shows Nick his zombie self, Nick becomes enraged and escapes. Tim, Cindy, Mike, and Vanessa reunite at the bowling arcade, only to be challenged to a bowling match by Tim's rival Danny and his team, who are all drunk; only drunken people see zombies as humans. Mike and Tim compete against them while Cindy and Vanessa keep them drunk to disorient them. All is well until they run out of beer and Danny's team sees they are truly zombies. A fight breaks out, and Mike is decapitated in the chaos, but his head remains alive. They kill Danny and his teammates when Nick shows up and assists them. He then reveals the truth to them, and Mike comes up with a plan to defeat the military by infecting most of the soldiers at the headquarters. They gain extra allies by resurrecting the dead bowling teammates with the contaminated ice cream and pose as corpses in a disposal truck on its way to the headquarters. They are almost caught by Colonel South's containment unit, but Mike sacrifices himself to kill them by activating a grenade with his mouth. Once the zombies reach the headquarters, Nick offers himself to Colonel South as a diversion while the others infect the rest of the soldiers present. Furious, Colonel South has Nick taken in alive. Tim, Cindy, Vanessa and the other zombies populate \\"Zombie Town\\", which is erected in memory of Mike and Nick. Colonel South and Dr. Richter plan to torture Nick for treason as a soldier, which he responds to by saying, \\"I'm not a soldier. I'm a zombie.\\"  Cast  * Matthew Davis as Mike * Julianna Robinson as Vanessa * Michael Grant Terry as Tim * Betsy Beutler as Cindy * Colby French as Nick Steele * Richard Riehle as Colonel South * Jack Orend as Dr. Richter * Joel McCrary as Mark Kanan * Tracey Walter as Mr. Whicks * Oren Skoog as Danny * Will Stiles as Chad * Michael Cornacchia as Ronald Rupert Eschelon III * Larry Weissman as The Drunk  Release  Wasting Away premiered on October 16, 2007, at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival. It was released on DVD on October 19, 2010.  Reception  Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that although zombie comedies have grown old, the film is \\"amusing and ingratiating\\". Allan Hunter of Screen Daily wrote, \\"Matthew Kohnen's inventive, well-acted romp has cult potential written all over it.\\" J.C. De Leon of Brutal as Hell wrote that the film has \\"moments of amusing comedy\\", though it focuses too much on silly humor over horror. Jodie Bass of Beyond Hollywood wrote, \\"This one really is destined to become a cult classic and rightly so.\\" Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict wrote that the film has a great gimmick but fails to live up to its promise, in part due to its budget. Writing in The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2, academic Peter Dendle said, \\"Though decidedly risk-averse, Aaah! Zombies!! pursues a conceptually innovative angle with satisfying detail and persistence.\\"  References  External links  2007 films 2000s comedy horror films American films Parodies of horror American comedy horror films American zombie comedy films English-language films 2007 comedy films ","title":"Wasting Away"},{"id":"36024613","text":"Plaisance is a village in Guyana between Better Hope and Goedverwagting.

It is a local non-profit conservation organization based in Julimes, Chihuahua, Mexico. Its mission is to conserve and protect the Natural Heritage of the people of Julimes, Chihuahua, with special emphasis on the micro-endemic aquatic fauna which distribution range is restricted to ‚ÄúEl Pande√±o‚Äù hotspring. Through its Technical Council, Amigos del Pande√±o supports scientific research and a Vital Signs Monitoring Program that informs management decision making processes that are related to the natural resources of Julimes. El Pande√±o hotspring in Julimes, Chihuahua, Mexico Conservation approach With support from partner NGOs including Biodesert, A.C., Pronatura Noreste, A.C., Profauna, A.C. and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF); Academic Institutions including UACH, UACJ, UANL, UNAM and UNM; Federal, State and Municipal governments; and the private sector including The Coca-Cola Company; Amigos del Pande√±o promotes Sustainable Development mainly within the municipality of Julimes. The organization seeks to develop and implement Adaptive Natural Resources Management Strategies; enhance local capacities; promote environmental education among the inhabitants of Julimes; and to develop public outreach. Amigos del Pande√±o also intervenes in water policy advocating for implementation of an environmental flow regime for the Rio Conchos Basin. Projects In 2012, in partnership with Pronatura Noreste, the WWF and SEMARNAT, Amigos del Pande√±o began implementing a water saving project which includes monitoring and upgrading of the Julimes irrigation network. In 2010, in partnership with Rotary International of Camargo, Chihuahua, the WWF- Chihuahuan Desert Program and the Municipality of Julimes, Amigos del Pande√±o built a biofilter which treats raw sewage from 50 homes in Julimes. The water treatment system was designed as a primary treatment plant that avoids untreated sewage to flow into the Rio Conchos. Thanks to the use of earth worms as part of the treatment process the resulting sludge can be used as fertilizer, and effluent will be used for irrigation. On September 28, 2010, the National Water Commission (CONAGUA) issued positive response to a request made by \\"Amigos del Pande√±o\\", to allow them to hold the custody, for the use and management of the federal lands surrounding \\"El Pande√±o\\" -officially known as \\"San Jose de Pandos\\"- thermal spring, for environmental purposes, for a ten years term.
