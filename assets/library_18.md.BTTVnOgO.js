The Corniche is 8 km long, and includes children's play areas, separate cycle and pedestrian pathways, restaurants, cafés and the Corniche Beach. It forms a sweeping curve on the western side of the main Abu Dhabi island and is replete with cycle paths, fountains and park areas. Between 2002 and 2003, land was reclaimed from the sea and the Corniche was extended. Some of the earlier landmarks were demolished in the process. Certain parts of the Corniche have significant deposition of sand, with people using the area as a public beach. Prior to the 1970s, the current area occupied by the Corniche was a beach, where dhows and ships used to anchor and transfer cargo or people; at the time, the Mina Zayed area was not yet constructed. Marina Mall is located across from the Corniche and can be accessed using a narrow breakwater road. At Marina Mall, the UAE flag is hoisted and holds the record for being one of the tallest flagpoles in the world.

It is believed that it was originally a Visigoth monastery dedicated to St. Deodata. Until the late 10th century, it was dedicated to St. Peter. In the 11th century, it became a Benedictine monastery but in 1216, it was transferred to the Augustinians. By 1723, after a gradual decline, it had only one prior and a lay brother. Becoming part of the deanery of Anheu, it served as a pilgrimage center for the entire region. During the Spanish Civil War in 1936, it was burned and later replaced by a replica. The sanctuary is dedicated to the Mare d'Àneu. Architecture and fittings Construction occurred in the first half of the 11th century. It consists of three naves with a central apse center and two side apses with cross vaults. It has a small bell tower with belfry. The facade was completely renovated in the 20th century. Highlights include the murals that decorated parts of the sanctuary, dedicated to the Epiphany and the Adoration of the Magi. The polychrome paintings are attributed to Master of Pedret, but may be later. The paintings can be seen at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.

The band consists of Theo Mindell (vocals, synthesizer, percussion), Mark Thomas Baker (guitar), Keith Nickel (bass guitar) and Tommy Rickard (drums). They are named after the Black Sabbath song of the same name. History Orchid formed in 2007 with a lineup of Mindell, Baker, Nickel and drummer Carter Kennedy. The group released their first EP, Through the Devil's Doorway, in 2009. It was followed by their debut studio album, Capricorn, released in 2011. Both of those initial releases on the Church Within label were later reissued together on the Nuclear Blast compilation album The Zodiac Sessions in 2013. Orchid's second studio album, The Mouths of Madness, was released via Nuclear Blast in 2013. In November of that year, the band embarked on a European tour, alongside Scorpion Child and Blues Pills. The band's next EP, Sign of the Witch, was released by Nuclear Blast on July 17, 2015. On April 21, 2016, Orchid announced that Kennedy had left the band the previous July, that Ted \\"TJ\\" Cox had joined as their new drummer that August, and that they were writing and demoing new material for a third full-length album due out in 2017. Later in 2016, Tommy Rickard joined as the band's new drummer replacing Cox. Musical style Rooted in blues rock and heavy metal, Orchid are highly praised by rock critics for their dark, riff-based doom metal sound, influenced by pioneering metal band Black Sabbath. British heavy metal magazine Metal Hammer said of the band, \\"Thought Sabbath had already written all the best riffs? Think again – these guys have some monsters\\".\\"Orchid\\" at Metal Hammer They have also been described as occult rock.

Faith Tech moved out in 1979, and the building was vacant for years until being opened as a retail outlet in the 1990s. That closed in 1996, and it sat vacant again until 2012, when it was purchased by John Wilton, who began refurbishing it. Description The Scottville School is a large brick structure, originally constructed in 1888 but with multiple later additions that altered its footprint. An additional single story frame building, measuring by , is also part of the complex. The main brick building is a symmetrical cross-shaped structure with hipped roof projecting center and wings, and a pyramid-roofed central square tower. Three gabled dormers project from the front.

In his decision, Judge Keogh described the town on the day of polling as 'more like a place besieged than one where a free election was going on' and criticised the behaviour and language of the clergy.

The development program is part of the PITVANT program and is funded by the Portuguese National Defense Ministry until 2015. The objective of the ANTEX-M is not to develop a fully operational UAV system to execute PoAF missions but to demonstrate aeronautical technology and support research and development projects of the Portuguese Air Force Academy and other academic and industrial partners.  History  The first program for the development of the ANTEX M was created by the Portuguese Air Force in 2002. This program had the objective of jointly researching and developing an experimental military UAV with the Portuguese Air Force Academy's Investigation Center () and several national and international institutes, universities, and industry partners (EDISOFT). The program's cost was estimated to be €2 million and was canceled before starting due to lack of funding. Another program, under the same name, was established in partnership with the Technical Institute (IST) of the University of Lisbon for the development of a remotely controlled vehicle for flight testing new aeronautical composites and materials. During this program the ANTEX-M models X00, X01 and X02 were developed and participated in the European projects Active Aeroelastic Aircraft Structures (3AS) and Aircraft Reliability Through Intelligent Materials Application (ARTIMA). From 2006 to 2008, the Air Force Academy and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) collaborated in developing an autonomous flight control system for unmanned aircraft. In 2007, the Portuguese Air Force created the PITVANT (, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Investigation and Technology Project), and presented it as a proposal to the National Defense Ministry for the allocation of €2 million in funding to be distributed during the seven years in which the project would be active. The project focus on the design, construction and testing of small and medium UAV platforms, interoperability of unmanned systems, data fusion, navigation systems. Included is also the testing of the systems in military scenarios, such as: maritime patrol, search and rescue, coastal surveillance, sea pollution control, and reconnaissance. The development of the ANTEX-M as part of PITVANT involves the FEUP (AsasF Project), IST, Institute of Geodesy and Navigation at the University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich, and the University of Victoria.

After the death of Cesari, the Abbot Oliva tried to annex the monastery, but met with opposition from the monks of the community. The monastery served as a place of refuge for pilgrims traveling to Montserrat. In the 15th century, it began to decline and in 1539, it was attached to Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey. The building was looted and burned by French troops in 1811 and 1812. The Abbot of Montserrat, Miquel Muntadas, ordered its reconstruction in 1862. Until in 1940, it served a community of Benedictine nuns; it was associated with the monastery of Sant Pere de les Puelles. In 1954 the nuns moved to a new monastery, Sant Benet, and since then the building has operated as a refuge for hikers and as a meeting center. Architecture and fittings The old monastery was of Romanesque style. There are three apses and two semicircular arches. There have been several renovations, the last carried out between 1928–31 to a design by the architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch.

Lloyd Preacher of Atlanta, Georgia. The hotel was the site of a tryst between John F. Kennedy and a Danish woman with connection to the Nazis. On February 6, 1942, just after Kennedy arrived in Charleston for service with naval intelligence, he spent three nights at the Fort Sumter Hotel with a former Miss Denmark, Inga Arvad. The FBI was monitoring Arvad and taped the encounters. The information was then passed to Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy, who, in an effort to separate his son from Arvad, had him reassigned to a PT boat in the Pacific, the now famous PT-109. John F. Kennedy remarked, \\"They shipped my ass out of town to break us up.\\" Starting on July 22, 1942, the hotel was used as the headquarters for the sixth naval district for $80,000 per year. It was refurbished and reopened as a hotel in 1946.

He was one of the notable federal officials in the State of Florida. Captain Horr was a Civil War veteran, enlisting as a Union soldier in 1861 with the 2nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry. After the reorganization of the regiment in Camp Dennison, he was elected to the rank of Second Lieutenant. After the Battle of Perryville in 1862 he was promoted to First Lieutenant and soon after the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863, he was promoted to the rank of Captain. After the end of the Civil War, Captain Horr moved to Nashville, Tennessee and was involved in the brokerage business. Shortly after, Captain Horr relocated to Kansas City, Missouri and purchased coal mines in Lexington, Missouri. As he grew his coal business, he built the Steamer J. F. Fraser to move his product through points along the Missouri River. Captain Horr eventually sold his mining interests and spent the next 5 years transporting products along the Red River and Ouachita River before eventually settling in Florida. In 1876, Captain Horr was appointed to the Office of the Collector of Customs as a clerk in Key West. After about 4 years, he became a bookkeeper at the John White Bank of Key West. While working in Key West, Captain Horr had purchased an island (later named Horr's Island) in northern Monroe County (now Collier County) and established a prosperous pineapple plantation and packing business on the island to supply his wholesale grocery business in Key West. With the island's growing pineapple business, a residence was built for the Captain in 1877 along with a school to accommodate the growing number of residents. In 1889, Captain Horr was appointed by President Harrison to be Collector of Customs for Key West. During these years, Key West witnessed its most prosperous years as a port. In February 1898, he was appointed as a Federal Marshall by President McKinley for the Jacksonville to Key West district of Florida and re-appointed again by President Roosevelt in 1902. During the election of 1900, Captain Horr was selected to be the Republican nominee as Secretary of State for the State of Florida. In 1920, he retired to Ohio and eventually sold Horr's Island in 1923 for the sum of $10,000. Captain John Foley Horr died in Jacksonville, Florida, on February 13, 1926.

It aired on Fox in the United States and Canada on December 8, 2013, and is written by Julius Sharpe and directed by Brian Iles. This episode is notable for being the first of the series where Brian Griffin is absent (as a result of his death in the previous episode, \\"Life of Brian\\"). He was replaced by Vinny in the episode and in the credits. This episode continues a three-episode arc depicting Brian's death, replacement and resurrection. Plot Quagmire asks to stay at the Griffin home after he makes eye contact with a transvestite at a bar. While hanging out with Peter, a bee makes them discover by accident that they can share a tone in harmony. After sitting down to write some songs, they go to Mort's pharmacy to get some paper and after Mort tells about his past career in music, becomes their manager and invites them to sing at the library during open mic. During their performance, the audience leaves. They despair that they are not a success until Mort reveals that he put their show on JewTube (a Jewish version of YouTube) and scoring them an invitation to perform at a music festival. Their performance is a hit and they get an offer for a new manager named Ricky, dumping Mort and going on tour over Lois' objections that she needs Peter to be with the family on Thanksgiving. Their life on the road begins to affect Peter, causing him to arbitrarily make decisions for the two of them and causes life to become stressful for Quagmire. During a performance on Conan, Quagmire finally has enough when Peter accidentally drops his plectrum into the sound hole. Quagmire smashes Peter's guitar and walks offstage, dissolving the partnership mid-performance. On Thanksgiving, Peter is forced to return to the family and beg forgiveness by pledging for the family to forgive him. They managed to forgive him. Quagmire shows up and asks for forgiveness as well. Peter forgives Quagmire. Despite things returning to normal, Peter's regret at giving up fame prompts him to shoot himself in the tour bus while claiming to get his things. Reception Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B–, saying \\"The end of the episode offers a timely reminder of just how insanely elastic Family Guy’s reality can be. The show has long since passed the point where the sudden reveal of a pseudo-stepfather like Larry could be considered surprising—although that doesn’t detract from its funniness as a throwaway gag—but this episode does end with Peter mulling over what it means to return to his normal, post-fame life, then promptly shooting himself. There’s only the most infinitesimal of chances that his apparent suicide will have any impact beyond its place here as a final dark punchline, but it’s still remarkable to think this is the same show that dealt with Brian’s death so seriously just two weeks prior. Family Guy is very far from perfect, but it’s still weirdly impressive that its format can stretch to include such diametrically opposite character deaths in the space of just two episodes.\\" The episode received a 2.7 rating and was watched by a total of 5.36 million people.

Although Mark E. Gold has shown that not every regular language can be learned this way (see language identification in the limit), approaches have been investigated for a variety of subclasses. They are sketched in this article. For learning of more general grammars, see Grammar induction. Example A regular language is defined as a (finite or infinite) set of strings that can be described by one of the mathematical formalisms called \\"finite automaton\\", \\"regular grammar\\", or \\"regular expression\\", all of which have the same expressive power. Since the latter formalism leads to shortest notations, it shall be introduced and used here. Given a set Σ of symbols (a.k.a. alphabet), a regular expression can be any of * ∅ (denoting the empty set of strings), * ε (denoting the singleton set containing just the empty string), * a (where a is any character in Σ; denoting the singleton set just containing the single-character string a), * r+s (where r and s are, in turn, simpler regular expressions; denoting their set's union) * r⋅s (denoting the set of all possible concatenations of strings from r 's and s 's set), * r+ (denoting the set of n-fold repetitions of strings from r 's set, for any n≥1), or * r* (similarly denoting the set of n-fold repetitions, but also including the empty string, seen as 0-fold repetition). For example, using Σ = { 0,1 }, the regular expression (0+1+ε)⋅(0+1) denotes the set of all binary numbers with one or two digits (leading zero allowed), while 1⋅(0+1)*⋅0 denotes the (infinite) set of all even binary numbers (no leading zeroes). Given a set of strings (also called \\"positive examples\\"), the task of regular language induction is to come up with a regular expression that denotes a set containing all of them. As an example, given { 1, 10, 100 }, a \\"natural\\" description could be the regular expression 1⋅0*, corresponding to the informal characterization \\"a 1 followed by arbitrarily many (maybe even none) 0es\\". However, (0+1)* and 1+(1⋅0)+(1⋅0⋅0) is another regular expression, denoting the largest (assuming Σ={0,1}) and the smallest set containing the given strings, and called the trivial overgeneralization and undergeneralization, respectively. Some approaches work in an extended setting where also a set of \\"negative example\\" strings is given; then, a regular expression is to be found that generates all of the positive, but none of the negative examples. Lattice of automata { style=\\"float:right\\"  Partial order of automata generating the strings 1, 10, and 100 (positive examples). For each of the negative example strings 11, 1001, 101, and 0, the upper set of automata generating it is shown. The only automata that generate all of { 1, 10, 100 }, but none of { 11, 1001, 101, 0 } are the trivial bottom automaton and the one corresponding to the regular expression 1⋅0*. } Dupont et al. have shown that the set of all structurally complete finite automatai.e. finite automata without unnecessary states and transitions, with respect to the given input set of strings generating a given input set of example strings forms a lattice, with the trivial undergeneralized and the trivial overgeneralized automaton as bottom and top element, respectively. Each member of this lattice can be obtained by factoring the undergeneralized automaton by an appropriate equivalence relation. For the above example string set { 1, 10, 100 }, the picture show at its bottom the undergeneralized automaton Aa,b,c,d in , consisting of states , , , and . On the state set { a,b,c,d }, a total of 15 equivalence relations exist, forming a lattice. MappingThis mapping is not a lattice homomorphism, but only a monotonic mapping. each equivalence E to the corresponding quotient automaton language L(Aa,b,c,d / E) obtains the partially ordered set shown in the picture. Each node's language is denoted by a regular expression. The language may be recognized by quotient automata w.r.t. different equivalence relations, all of which are shown below the node. An arrow between two nodes indicates that the lower node's language is a proper subset of the higher node's. If both positive and negative example strings are given, Dupont et al. build the lattice from the positive examples, and then investigate the separation border between automata that generate some negative example and such that do not. Most interesting are those automata immediately below the border. In the picture, separation borders are shown for the negative example strings 11 (), 1001 (, 101 (), and 0 (). Coste and Nicolas present an own search method within the lattice, which they relate to Mitchell's version space paradigm. To find the separation border, they use a graph coloring algorithm on the state inequality relation induced by the negative examples. Later, they investigate several ordering relations on the set of all possible state fusions. Kudo and Shimbo use the representation by automaton factorizations to give a unique framework for the following approaches (sketched below): * k-reversible languages and the \\"tail clustering\\" follow-up approach, * Successor automata and the predecessor-successor method, and * pumping-based approaches (framework-integration challenged by Luzeaux, however). Each of these approaches is shown to correspond to a particular kind of equivalence relations used for factorization. Approaches =k-reversible languages= Angluin considers so-called \\"k-reversible\\" regular automata, that is, deterministic automata in which each state can be reached from at most one state by following a transition chain of length k. Formally, if Σ, Q, and δ denote the input alphabet, the state set, and the transition function of an automaton A, respectively, then A is called k-reversible if : ∀a0,...,ak ∈ Σ ∀s1, s2 ∈ Q: δ*(s1,a0...ak) = δ*(s2,a0...ak) ⇒ s1 = s2, where δ* means the homomorphic extension of δ to arbitrary words. Angluin gives a cubic algorithm for learning of the smallest k-reversible language from a given set of input words; for k=0, the algorithm has even almost linear complexity. The required state uniqueness after k+1 given symbols forces unifying automaton states, thus leading to a proper generalization different from the trivial undergeneralized automaton. This algorithm has been used to learn simple parts of English syntax; later, an incremental version has been provided. Another approach based on k-reversible automata is the tail clustering method. =Successor automata= From a given set of input strings, Vernadat and Richetin build a so-called successor automaton, consisting of one state for each distinct character and a transition between each two adjacent characters' states. For example, the singleton input set { ' } leads to an automaton corresponding to the regular expression (a+⋅b+)*. An extension of this approach is the predecessor- successor method which generalizes each character repetition immediately to a Kleene + and then includes for each character the set of its possible predecessors in its state. Successor automata can learn exactly the class of local languages. Since each regular language is the homomorphic image of a local language, grammars from the former class can be learned by lifting, if an appropriate (depending on the intended application) homomorphism is provided. In particular, there is such a homomorphism for the class of languages learnable by the predecessor-successor method. The learnability of local languages can be reduced to that of k-reversible languages. { style=\\"float:right\\"  Brzozowski derivative (on red background) of a dictionary string set with respect to \\"con\\" } { style=\\"float:right\\"  Illustration of the pumping lemma for regular automata } =Early approaches= Chomsky and Miller (1957) used the pumping lemma: they guess a part v of an input string uvw and try to build a corresponding cycle into the automaton to be learned; using membership queries they ask, for appropriate k, which of the strings uw, uvvw, uvvvw, ..., uvkw also belongs to the language to be learned, thereby refining the structure of their automaton. In 1959, Solomonoff generalized this approach to context-free languages, which also obey a pumping lemma. =Cover automata= Câmpeanu et al. learn a finite automaton as a compact representation of a large finite language. Given such a language F, they search a so-called cover automaton A such that its language L(A) covers F in the following sense: , where is the length of the longest string in F, and denotes the set of all strings not longer than . If such a cover automaton exists, F is uniquely determined by A and . For example, F = { ad, read, reread } has and a cover automaton corresponding to the regular expression (r⋅e)*⋅a⋅d. For two strings x and y, Câmpeanu et al. define x ~ y if xz∈F ⇔ yz∈F for all strings z of a length such that both xz and yz are not longer than .This relation generalizes the relation RF from the Myhill-Nerode theorem. It has been investigated in more detail in sect.3 of: Based on this relation, whose lack of transitivityFor example, F = { aab, baa, aabb } leads to aab ~ aabb (only z=ε needs to be considered to check this) and aabb ~ baa (similarly), but not aab ~ baa (due to the case z=b). According to Câmpeanu et al. (2001, Lemma 1, p.5), however x ~ y ∧ y ~ z → x ~ z holds for strings x, y, z with x ≤ y ≤ z. causes considerable technical problems, they give an O(n4)where n is the number of states of a DFA AF such that L(AF) = F algorithm to construct from F a cover automaton A of minimal state count. Moreover, for union, intersection, and difference of two finite languages they provide corresponding operations on their cover automata. Păun et al. improve the time complexity to O(n2). =Residual automata= For a set S of strings and a string u, the Brzozowski derivative u−1S is defined as the set of all rest-strings obtainable from a string in S by cutting off its prefix u (if possible), formally: u−1S = { v ∈ Σ*: uv ∈ S }, cf. picture. Denis et al. define a residual automaton to be a nondeterministic finite automaton A where each state q corresponds to a Brzozowski derivative of its accepted language L(A), formally: ∀q∈Q ∃u∈Σ*: L(A,q) = u−1L(A), where L(A,q) denotes the language accepted from q as start state. They show that each regular language is generated by a uniquely determined minimal residual automaton. Its states are ∪-indecomposable Brzozowski derivatives, and it may be exponentially smaller than the minimal deterministic automaton. Moreover, they show that residual automata for regular languages cannot be learned in polynomial time, even assuming optimal sample inputs. They give a learning algorithm for residual automata and prove that it learns the automaton from its characteristic sample of positive and negative input strings. =Query Learning= Regular languages cannot be learned in polynomial time using only membership queries or using only equivalence queries. However, Angluin has shown that regular languages can be learned in polynomial time using membership queries and equivalence queries, and has provided a learning algorithm termed L* that does exactly that. The L* algorithm was later generalised to output an NFA (non-deterministic finite automata) rather than a DFA (deterministic finite automata), via an algorithm termed NL*. This result was further generalised, and an algorithm that outputs an AFA (alternating finite automata) termed AL* was devised. It is noted that NFA can be exponentially more succinct than DFAs, and that AFAs can be exponentially more succinct than NFAs and doubly-exponentially more succinct than DFAs. =Reduced regular expressions= Brill defines a reduced regular expression to be any of * a (where a is any character in Σ; denoting the singleton set just containing the single-character string a), * ¬a (denoting any other single character in Σ except a), * • (denoting any single character in Σ) * a*, (¬a)*, or •* (denoting arbitrarily many, possibly zero, repetitions of characters from the set of a, ¬a, or •, respectively), or * r⋅s (where r and s are, in turn, simpler reduced regular expressions; denoting the set of all possible concatenations of strings from r 's and s 's set). Given an input set of strings, he builds step by step a tree with each branch labelled by a reduced regular expression accepting a prefix of some input strings, and each node labelled with the set of lengths of accepted prefixes. He aims at learning correction rules for English spelling errors,For example: Replace \\"past\\" by \\"passed\\" in the context \\"(¬t⋅o)*⋅SINGULAR_NOUN⋅past\\" rather than at theoretical considerations about learnability of language classes. Consequently, he uses heuristics to prune the tree-buildup, leading to a considerable improvement in run time.

It was declared as a Bé Cultural d'Interès Nacional landmark in 1973. The monastery was founded before 812. History Cloister The monastery was founded before 812. The first record of a document written in the monastery is dated 822 by the abbot, Bonitus. Bonitus' successor was Abbot Mercoral. The first inhabitants of Banyoles settled around the monastery and remained for centuries under the feudal power of the abbot. The buildings of the monastery were destroyed several times throughout its history. The architectural group that has survived is a mixture of styles, the product of different construction period. In the 10th century, the first church of the monastery was destroyed after being attacked by Saracen troops. In 957, the bishop of Girona, Arnulf, dedicated a new temple, with three apses. In the 11th century, Sant Esteve was again destroyed, and then rebuilt, with a new consecration in 1086. The whole building was also affected by the earthquake that devastated the area in 1427 and 1428. In 1655, the bell tower and the cloister were destroyed. In the 17th century, restoration work occurred. Between 1692-99, a new steeple was built. Architecture and fittings The building's first documented cloister is dated 1086 and was in Romanesque style. The nave includes a triple apse. The front entrance, built in the 16th century, is in late Gothic style, while the rest of the building is of 17th-century Neoclassical style. Other buildings mentioned are the refectory, dormitory, chapter house, monks' housing, cellar, barn, and kitchen. During the cloister restoration, completed in 2003, remains of Romanesque capitals were found. They are valued for their historical importance, dated to the 11th century, with paintings of the late Gothic period. Arqueta de Sant Martirià Arqueta de Sant Martirià (Casket of Saint Martirià) is considered one of the most prominent goldsmithing elements of Girona. It is 15th-century Gothic and contains the remains of Sant Martirià, patron of the city. The cypress wood box is coated with silver and shaped as a Gothic church, surrounded by seven figures which are also silver-coated. Altar of Our Lady of Scale is a preserved mid-15th-century piece attributed to teacher Joan Antigó. In the center of the altar, there is a 15th-century Gothic sculpture, Verge de l'Escala. The Baroque organ, built in the 18th century, is located in the lobby. Bibliography Elisabeth Oliva, et alt. 2005. El patrimoni del Pla de l'Estany. Inventari històric i arquitectònic de la comarca.

According to Catherine A. Sanderson (2010) “Sociocultural perspective: A perspective describing people’s behavior and mental processes as shaped in part by their social and/or cultural contact, including race, gender, and nationality.” Sociocultural perspective theory is a broad yet significant aspect in our being. It applies to every sector of our daily lives. How we communicate, understand, relate and cope with one another is partially based on this theory. Our spiritual, mental, physical, emotional, physiological being are all influenced by factors studied by sociocultural perspective theory. Ideology Various studies examine topics using the sociocultural perspective in order to account for variability from person to person and acknowledge that social and cultural differences affect these individuals. One example comes from the journal European Psychologist: Investigating Motivation in Context: Developing Sociocultural Perspectives by Richard A. Walker, Kimberley Pressick-kilborn, Bert M. Lancaster, and Erica J. Sainsbury (2004). Recently, however, a renewed interest in the contextual nature of motivation has come about for several reasons. First, the relatively recent influence of the ideas of Vygotsky and his followers (John-Steiner & Mahn, 1996; Greeno & The Middle School Through Applications Project, 1998) in educational psychology has led writers in the field (Goodenow, 1992; Pintrich, 1994; Anderman & Anderman, 2000) to acknowledge the importance of context and to call for its greater recognition in educational psychology, and more particularly in motivational research. As both Goodenow (1992) and Hickey (1997) note, in sociocultural theories deriving from Vygotsky, human activities, events, and actions cannot be separated from the context in which they occur so that context becomes an important issue in sociocultural research. Second, researchers concerned with learning and cognition (e.g., Greeno et al., 1998) have come to see these processes also as being situated in particular contexts. While this view, with its emphasis on the distributed nature of learning and cognition, has origins in sociocultural theories\\". This theory or perspective is examined in The Modern Language Journal “A Sociocultural Perspective on Language Learning Strategies: The Role of Mediation” by Richard Donato and Dawn McCormick. According to Donato and McCormick (1994) “Sociocultural theory maintains that social interaction and cultural institutions, such as schools, classrooms, etc., have important roles to play in an individual’s cognitive growth and development.” “We believe that this perspective goes beyond current cognitive and social psychological conceptions of strategic language learning, both of which assume that language tasks and contexts are generalizable. The sociocultural perspective, on the other hand, views language learning tasks and contexts as situated activities that are continually under development (22) and that are influential upon individuals’ strategic orientations to classroom learning.”Modern Language Journal, Vol 78(4), Win, 1994. Special issue: Sociocultural theory and second language learning. pp. 453-464. Health factors The sociocultural perspective is also used here in order to assess use of mental health services for immigrants: “From a sociocultural perspective, this article reviews causes of mental health service under use among Chinese immigrants and discusses practice implications. Factors explaining service under use among Chinese immigrants are multifaceted, extending across individual, family, cultural and system domains. The first of these is cultural explanation of mental illness. Cultural beliefs, regarding the cause of mental disorders greatly affect service use. The perceived causes of mental illness include moral, religious, or cosmological, physiological, psychological, social and genetic factors”. From Canadian Social Work, “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, (2010).Canadian Social Work: “A Sociocultural Perspective of Mental Health Services Use by Chinese Immigrants” by Lin Fang, Autumn 2010, Vol. 12 Issue 1, p152-160, 9p Coping According to Asian American Journal of Psychology, \\"Coping with perceived racial and gender discrimination experiences among 11 Asian/Asian American female faculty at various Christian universities\\" have been examined in this theory. After the study was conducted the results revealed that \\"ten of the 11 women described experiences where they perceived being treated differently due to race and/or gender. Qualitative analyses of interview data revealed four themes related to coping: Proactive Coping, External Support, Personal Resources, and Spiritual Coping. The resulting themes are discussed in light of existing research, with an emphasis on the importance of understanding cultural and religious values to the study of coping\\". Kim, C. L., Hall, M., Anderson, T. L., & Willingham, M. M. (2011). Coping with discrimination in academia: Asian-American and Christian perspectives. Asian American Journal of Psychology, 2(4), 291-305. Language Another instance of the sociocultural perspective can be found in language learning literature: “By adopting a sociocultural perspective that highlights the critical role of the social context in cognitive and social development (Vygotsky, 1978), we propose that learners’ actions to facilitate or sometimes constrain their language learning cannot be fully understood without considering the situated contexts in which strategies emerge and develop, as well as the kinds of hierarchies within which studies from diverse backgrounds find themselves in U.S. classrooms (Bourdieu, 1991).

It was constructed between 1846 and 1847, on the east side of Cheetham Hill Road. The parish functions under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Salford. Origins St Chad's is the Catholic mother-church of Manchester, tracing its origins back to the 1770s. With the legacy of £200 from the will of the Revd Edward Helme (the first resident Catholic priest since the Reformation) a chapel dedicated to St Chad was built on Rook Street off Market Street in 1776 (now lost under new buildings). The Revd Roland Broomhead became the first Rector 1776-1820, and built new chapels of St Mary Mulberry Street and St Augustine, Granby Row. He died shortly after the opening of the latter, after which St Chad's became chapel-of-ease to the new church. However, due to a growing need, it became an independent mission again in 1835 when Fr William Turner, who would later become the first Bishop of Salford, was appointed to take charge. He was succeeded in 1842 by Fr Robert Croskell, later to be the second Provost and Vicar General of the Diocese. The Rook Street chapel was sold in 1846 to be converted into a warehouse. For a short time there was a chapel-of-ease served from St Chad's; St William's on Simpson Street in Angel Meadow (1865-1905). Construction The new church was designed by Weightman and Hadfield in the Gothic Revival style for Fr Robert Croskell. Building work commenced in April 1846 and the new church was opened 4 August 1847 by Bishop George Hilary Brown. Clergy The church was served by clergy of the Salford Diocese until 2003 when the last resident Parish Priest, Fr Bernard McGarry retired. The church was then served for a period from St Anne, Crumpsall. In 2007, the Premonstratensians took up residence following the closure of Corpus Christi Priory, Miles Platting, however they only stayed for a short period. St Chad's then served as the residence for the Strangeways Prison chaplain. In 2013, the Oratorian community from the Church of the Holy Name of Jesus, Manchester took over St Chad's with permission to establish the Manchester Oratory of St Philip Neri there.

It was first referenced around the year 961, and was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural landmark in 1931. The Romanesque building is an excellent example of the town's medieval architecture and has been remodeled several times. It includes the Porta Ferrada, the symbol of the town, as well as two towers. It houses a history museum. On the basis of available records, the foundation of the Benedictine monastery can be traced back to the first half of the 10th century. The bay of Guixols was chosen due to its good natural harbour and the proximity to the coast of the nearby range of hills, which would make it easier to flee and would give a certain degree of protection in cases of attack from the sea. The decision was no doubt also influenced by the martyrdom of Saint Felix of Africa and the opportunity to take advantage of existing buildings dating from the Roman period. The monastery's role was to control the agricultural exploitation and production of the surrounding region, and also to provide protection to its inhabitants in return. It was thus a fortified coastal monastery exercising its feudal dominion over the territory. At its foundation, the monastery was dedicated to Saint Felix and the name of Sant Feliu (in its Catalan form) was thereafter forever associated with that of Guíxols, thus giving the present-day name of the town (used from the 10th century onwards).

It is a colonial species and forms aggregations on the lower shore near low-water mark. It is native to South Africa.  Description  Dendropoma corallinaceus is a gregarious species which forms clusters of white, irregular tubes up to in diameter and in length, often embedded into the thin layer of coralline algae covering the rocks. The tubes are tangled together and cemented to a hard surface. Each tube has a reddish-brown flat operculum with a raised central bulge. Distribution and habitat Dendropoma corallinaceus is native to the western Indian Ocean and the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and occurs round the coasts of South Africa and Mozambique. It is found attached to rocks on shallow reefs and is often encrusted by coralline algae. It may form large sheets near low tide mark on exposed rocky shores. Biology Dendropoma corallinaceus breeds between July and December. A single embryo is brooded in a capsule in the mantle cavity of the snail. When sufficiently mature, the protoconch crawls out of the tube and uses a sticky trail of mucus to avoid being swept away. It moves towards light and settles after between one and five days, whenever it finds a suitable position in which to anchor itself. About two days later it undergoes metamorphosis. It prefers to settle on the coralline alga Lithothamnion in which it can easily cut a groove with its radula. This helps it to attach itself firmly to the substrate and avoid being swept away by the waves. This worm snail is a suspension feeder. It secretes a mucus net which ensnares food particles from the surrounding water and is periodically wound up and swallowed by the snail. The nets of nearby snails overlap each other and coalesce. Parts may get hauled in by a snail other than the one that secreting that part.

Only one example flew as the type proved to be unsuccessful and was abandoned. Design and development Following the outbreak of the First World War, the Sunbeam Motor Car Company became a major supplier of licence-built aircraft for the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS), in addition to its existing work as a designer and builder of aero-engines and motor vehicles.Bruce 1957, p. 637.Mason 1994, p. 83. In November 1916, a requirement for a single-engined, single-seat bomber was issued on behalf of the RNAS,Bruce 2001, p. 4. and when Sunbeam decided to design an aircraft to respond to this specification, it received an order for two prototypes from the Admiralty. Sunbeam's design was a two-bay biplane of conventional tractor configuration. It was powered by one of Sunbeam's own Arab V8 engines rated at and driving a two-bladed propeller. The aircraft's fuel tanks were located in the fuselage at the aircraft's centre of gravity, which resulted in the pilot's cockpit being well behind the wings (and behind the nose). Racks for three 100 lb (45 kg) bombs were fitted under the wings, while a single forward-firing synchronized Vickers machine gun was mounted above the aircraft's engine.Bruce 1957, pp. 637–638. The first prototype, serial number N515 first flew at Castle Bromwich in late 1917, but exhibited a number of problems. The Puma engine, despite being ordered in large numbers, was unreliable and suffered from severe vibration, which considerably delayed service testing. The aircraft's layout, with the pilot sitting so far aft, gave him a poor view, and sitting away from the Vickers gun, could no nothing to resolve any gun stoppage. When eventually formally tested, in August 1918, it proved to be heavier and carry fewer bombs than the private venture Sopwith B.1 of similar concept. The second prototype was abandoned before it was completed, and no orders were placed either for the Sunbeam or the Sopwith,Mason 1994, pp. 82–83. which were incapable of defending themselves against attacking enemy fightersBruce 2001, p.5.

The portrayal of women in the visual arts depend on the context on how Philippine society perceives women and their roles in human communities, such as their own. Women in paintings In the field of painting, Filipino visual artists depicted women in their painting as women who are influential and with authority, women who are engaged in domestic activities, and women who are shown to be under the control of influential men in the Philippines or foreign men. =Amorsolo's women= In painting the faces and figures of Filipino women, Philippine National Artist Fernando Amorsolo (1892-1972) was able to develop his own template on how to paint and create Filipino women in his art: women with rounded faces but not oval, with \\"exceptionally lively eyes\\" (not dreamy or sleepy), with \\"firm and strongly marked\\" noses (not blunt in form), with clear skin and fresh color, not necessarily of white complexion nor of dark brown Malayan color. Amorsolo painted Filipino women that is similar to the stature of a \\"blushing\\" girl.Paras-Perez, Rodriguez. Amorsolo Drawings (excerpt available online) (1992), . =Luna's women= España y Filipinas (1886) by Juan Luna In contrast, Filipino painter, sculptor, ilustrado, propagandist, political activist and revolutionary hero Juan Luna (1857–1899) painted women in a different light. In his painting known as España y Filipinas (\\"Spain and the Philippines\\", 1886), Luna used symbolism and allegory by rendering a taller and strong-shouldered maternal Spaniard woman (representing Spain and colonialism) guiding a shorter, graceful and \\"humbly dressed\\" Filipino woman (representing the Philippines) towards the way to progress.Ocampo, Ambeth. Juan Luna’s works, Looking Back, Inquirer Opinion/Columns, Inquirer, opinion.inquirer.net, October 24, 2007Arrizón, Alicia.

Acceptance, satire, rebellion – the Philippine and Mexican exhibitions at the Singapore Art Museum show us the many ways artists deal with the powers that be, clarissa-tan.com Prolific in his career as a painter, Luna produced scenes that depict Philippine and European life. Luna's portrayal of European women can be seen in his Las Damas Romanas (Roman Women, 1882), the Odalisque (1885), La Madrileña (The Woman from Madrid, c. 1880s), En el Balcon (At the Balcony, 1884), Picnic in Normany (c. 1880s), The Parisian Life (1892), Despues del Baile (After the Dance, c. 1880s), Street Flower Vendor (c. 1880s), Ensueños de Amor (Dreams of Love, c. 1890s), Mi Novia (My Girlfriend) and La Marquesa de Monte Bolivar (The Marchioness of Monte Olivar, 1881). Luna's depiction of Filipino women can be viewed in Tampuhan (1895), La Bulaqueña (The Woman from Bulacan, 1895), Nena y Tinita (Nena and Tinita, c. 1880s). Luna also painted a scene depicting Egyptian women in his La Muerte de Cleopatra (The Death of Cleopatra, 1881). =Hidalgo's women= A Lady in the Moonlight (undated) by Félix Resurrección Hidalgo Félix Resurrección Hidalgo (1855-1913), one of the great Filipino painters of the late 19th century, has his fair share of artistic contribution in painting historical female characters through the visual arts during his time. Hidalgo's Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Mob, 1884) recounting the suffering that women has experienced during the period in ancient Roman history when the persecution of Christians in Ancient Rome occurred.Ocampo, Ambeth R. Las virgenes Cristianas expuestas al populacho, Jovenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho, Christian Maidens Exposed to the Populace), Looking Back, Philippine Daily Inquirer, page 9, March 15, 2000. Presented in the masterpiece were two almost nude female slaves (symbolizing Filipino women), helpless and stripped of dignity, being auctioned to boorish and sexually-hungry Roman male onlookers.Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho by Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, Appreciating Luna and Hidalgo, Looking Back, Philippine Daily Inquirer, page 9, February 14, 2001 Hidalgo also has a painting of a caucasian woman titled A lady in the Moonlight (undated). =Other painters= Fabián de la Rosa, the mentor and uncle of Fernando Amorsolo and his brother Pablo Amorsolo (1898–1945) had his own technique of painting women. De la Rosa painted a group of Women Working in a Rice Field in 1902 and his portrait of a Young Filipina in 1928. Pablo Amorsolo himself painted his own rendition of a female Fruit Vendor (undated). Women in sculptures =Rizal's women= The Triumph of Science over Death (1890) by José Rizal Painter, sculptor, writer, revolutionary and Philippine national hero José Rizal (1861-1896) also used the theme of a woman of power in his sculptures. His clay sculpture known as The Triumph of Science over Death (also known as Scientia, 1890) was a rendering of a naked and young woman with overflowing hair standing and trampling a skull while bearing a torch held high. The sculpture symbolized the ignorance of humankind durings the Dark Ages. The torch being held by the woman signified the victory and enlightenment that humankind has received by vanquishing death through science., pp. 181-183 and 191. In another sculpture known as the Victory of Death over Life (1890), Rizal portrayed a woman that was limp and lifeless against the hold and embrace of a cloaked figure of a standing skeleton (the symbol of death). Rizal also sculpted another figure of a woman known as the Reclining Nude (1890). Rizal's technique of molding women into sculptures involved the rendering of the young female body as a representation of vitality and virtue. Rizal's \\"sculptured women\\", as described by Raquel A. G. Reyes in her book Love, Passion and Patriotism: Sexuality and the Philippine Propaganda Movement, 1882 - 1892 were smooth, young, with unblemished condition, with traditional signs of long abundant and flowing hair on the head, with rounded conical breasts, and with absence of pubic hair on the genital area. This overall softness and fluidity were a contrasting effect against the hardness of the escayola material used by Rizal in sculpting these women. Rizal had drawn a sketch, using crayons, of his former girlfriend Leonor Rivera. Women and sexuality in Philippine art As one example of women in Philippine art, Rizal's three sculptures (as discussed above) were described by Raquel A. G. Reyes as a \\"rare representation of the insatiable female sexuality that Rizal (...) attributed to the non-Filipino woman\\". Reyes further explained that Rizal did not want women in the Philippines to \\"imitate or to emulate\\" the foreign women, such as the European women of his time, who were the basis of his sculptures.

He was a lifelong advocate for open government and gained national fame for his efforts to defend and define First Amendment rights of the press. Biography =Early life= Howard H \\"Tim\\" Hays Jr. was born in Chicago on June 2, 1917. His parents, Howard H Hays Sr. and Margaret Mauger Hays, moved Tim and his brothers Dan and William H. Hays with them first to Yellowstone National Park and then Glacier National Park, where his father ran the Red Bus tours. The Hays family eventually moved to Riverside in 1924. He attended Riverside Polytechnic High School, where he showed an early interest in journalism. He was editor of the school newspaper, Poly Spotlight, his senior year. Following his graduation from Riverside Polytechnic, he attended Stanford University, graduating in 1939 with a bachelor of science in social science. He went on to get a law degree from Harvard Law School in 1942. =Publishing career= During World War II, Hays was a special agent of the FBI. Following the War, Hays left the FBI and briefly worked for the San Bernardino Sun as reporter. He then joined the Press-Enterprise in 1946 as an assistant editor under his father, Howard H. Hays, Sr, who was editor and co- owner of the paper. Tim Hays spent the next 51 years at the Press-Enterprise. Though he never practiced law, Hays took and passed the bar in the same year. Over the years, he rose from assistant editor to editor in 1949, then co- publisher, then publisher, and finally chairman, a role which he held until 1997. As publisher, Hays took on a number of stories which elicited strong legal opposition from government officials. In 1967, he supervised the publication of a series of more than 100 articles exposing abuse of authority by a judge who served as the conservator for the Agua Caliente Indians in Palm Springs. The judge in question attempted to use his judicial authority to have Hays arrested to end the series of articles. Hays refused to be silenced and successfully avoided being jailed. For these stories the Press-Enterprise received the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1968. His subsequent efforts to fight restrictions on the freedom of the press that local government officials and judges attempted to impose resulted in the Press-Enterprise taking two open-government cases all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The newspaper won both cases. Lawyers working in the area of First Amendment rights routinely refer to the precedents set by these two cases as \\"Press- Enterprise One\\" and \\"Press-Enterprise Two\\". These cases established the right of the public (and the press) (1) to attend jury selection in criminal trial proceedings and (2) to attend pre-trial hearings in criminal cases with few exceptions in January 1984 and in 1986 respectively. Hays was on the boards of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the Pulitzer Prize, and the Associated Press. Hays stepped down as chairman when the Press-Enterprise was bought by the A.H. Belo Co. from the Hays family. Following the sale of the paper, Hays retired to St. Louis, Missouri. Despite his retirement, he remained active in civic affairs for a number of years. =University of California advocacy efforts= Hays played an active role in advocating for the establishment of a campus of the University of California in Riverside. The efforts of Hays and his fellow Riverside-area civic leaders lead to the opening of the University of California, Riverside in 1954. Hays established the Hays Press-Enterprise Lecture at the University of California, Riverside, in 1966. After selling the Press-Enterprise in 1998, he created a $100,000 endowment to sustain the yearly lectures into perpetuity. A few of the keynote speakers who have given lectures since the inception of the series include: retired Washington Post Executive Editor Ben Bradlee; former New York Times managing editor Gene Roberts; CNN president, W. Thomas Johnson. =Mission Inn advocacy= Hays championed the preservation of the Mission Inn, which he and other civic leaders fought to preserve during a seven-year period when it was shut down and surrounded by a chain link fence. Several attempts to reopen the Mission Inn, a state and national historic monument, ended in failure. There was a threat that the Inn would be demolished and a new municipal parking lot built in its place. Hays and the other civic leaders advocacy ultimately resulted in Duane Roberts, a local businessman, buying the hotel in 1992 and investing millions of dollars to restore and reopen it. =Marriage and children= Hays' first wife, Helen Hays Yeager, predeceased him by two years to the day. After he and his first wife divorced, Tim Hays married Susan Gudermath Hays. Hays had two sons, Tom Hays, a writer for the Associated Press, and Bill Hays. =Death and legacy= Hays, who had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease later in life, died at the age of 94 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Press-Enterprise office building was named the Howard H \\"Tim\\" Hays Media Center when it was dedicated in 2006.

Biography  Yitzhak Katz was born in Mykolaiv in the southwest Russia Empire (today Ukraine) to a religious Jewish family. His father, Abraham Katz, was an ordained rabbi. His mother was Reisel Kosowski. In 1906, Katz moved to Alexandria, Egypt, where his father opened a sewing shop and founded the Yiddish Theater Association. In 1912 the family moved to Cairo, but Yitzhak remained in Alexandria with his married sister. He studied at a high school run by Baron de Menashe Elijah Antebi (brother of Albert Antebi). Another famous student in school was Aaron Rosenfeld, who later became a pioneer of shipping in the Land of Israel. In the evenings, Katz studied painting. After graduation, he moved to Cairo and earned a living writing plays for the Green Theater. Katz planned to study literature and art history in Paris, but in December 1919 he met Batsheva Charlap from Rehovot, daughter of Ephraim Zvi Charlap. When she returned to Palestine in the spring of 1920, he followed her. Katz settled in Jerusalem, where he worked as a government clerk. A few months later, he married Batsheva and began working for the Palestine Express travel agency. He developed ties at this time with the owner of Tarbut publishing house, Joshua Chachik, and other local intellectuals and artists, among them the painter Reuven Rubin. At the end of 1923, he moved with his wife, daughter and sister-in-law to Tel Aviv. They lived on Ahad Ha'am Street, and the house became a meeting place for the Tel–Aviv bohemia of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1924, Katz left his job at the travel agency. In April 1925, he became secretary of the Regional Chamber of Jaffa (later the Tel Aviv Chamber of Commerce), a position he filled until 1952. In 1928, Meir Dizengoff appointed Katz honorary Consul of Belgium. He served in this capacity until 1936. Art criticism Alongside his work in the public sector, Katz published reviews and art criticism in journals and Hebrew newspapers. Yigal Zalmona described Katz as “a man of culture who fought the first war for modern art” in Israel. In 1925, in the publication \\"Theater and Art\\", Katz wrote that he sought to establish a new national art that would be \\"an antithesis to art of the exile which was based on biblical iconography” but would rather \\"find inspiration from the contemporary Eastern and Western cultures\\".Zalmona , Yigal , 100 Years of Israeli Art , The Israel Museum , Jerusalem, 2013 Archive When Katz died in 1991, his archive was transferred to the Information Center for Israeli Art in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

Lucavsala is a popular swimming place, with a relaxation and sports centre, as well as a rowing centre named after Ivans Klementjevs.  History  Lucavsala was created in the 18th century by merging a lot of small islands into the long and narrow Jumpravsala. This occurred because of the building of a dam that was created to control the waters of Daugava. The dam also merged Vīberta island into the mainland and made Zvirgzdu island a peninsula, or half-island. In the former territory of the dam that merged many islands, Dienvidu bridge was built.

The space in the cave reaches heights between 3 and 5 meters and has a width of 5 meters. The filling material has been used to create and protect the space within the cave.  Human presence  Since ancient times, the cave was used as a place of worship. According to the writings of ancient Greek historian Herodotus, human presence in the cave (as well as the old city of Physkos, today called Marmaris), dates back to 3,000 BC. However, excavations carried out by the Municipality of Marmaris in 2007 extended this period to almost 12,000 years back. The research conducted in this place has revealed the existence of a cult of Mother Goddess Leto, believed to be the mother of God Apollo and Goddess Artemis, in the ancient city of Physkos. The cave is located at the highest point of Heaven Island and was used as a place of worship by the ancient residents of the town of Nimara. By the fifth century BC, the place had become a prominent place of worship with no further modifications in the cave and the worshipping took place pretty much around the main rock that exists even today. This main rock is surrounded by stone altars in a semi-circle raised at about 30 cm from the ground. Offerings to the Mother Goddess Leto were placed on these elevated stones. The offerings were made in the form of cremations, glass beads, terracotta, and sculptures of Leto. The cave was also in use during the Roman period. The recent excavations in the cave (2007) have proved that Muğla’s earliest human settlements were in and around Marmaris. The cave has become a popular tourist destination since then.

It is situated on top of La Mola, the summit of the rocky mountain massif, Sant Llorenç del Munt, within Parc Natural de Sant Llorenç del Munt i l'Obac. It was declared a Bien de Interés Cultural landmark in 1931. History The first record that indicates there was a religious community here governed by an abbot corresponds to the year 986. In 1014, the word monastery appeared in a document associated with Count Ramon Borrell and his wife regarding a land swap with the abbey of San Llorenç. There is mention in 1018 regarding an abbot at Sant Llorenç del Munt. During this time period, the area was invaded several times by the Saracens, but there is no record of any attacks against buildings that were in the top of Sant Llorenç del Munt. Construction of the Romanesque building which currently stands began in 1045 and was consecrated in 1064 by the Bishop and the Counts of Barcelona. Its decline began the early 12th century, although it continued to be inhabited by a Benedictine monk until 1608. By 1637, there was no evidence of a priest in charge of the monastery, and it was later known to abandoned. On March 30, 1809 the troops of Napoleon's army destroyed what was left of the monastery, even desecrating the abbots' graves. Architecture and fittings Interior view The current building, constructed between the late 19th century and mid-20th centuries, respects the original structure built in the mid-11th century. It is a good example of the religious Catalan Romanesque style, one of the few existing monasteries of this time. The structure of the church has not undergone any change that alter its original design. It is an exact replica, but half the size of the Monastery of Sant Cugat, which promoted Sant Llorenç del Munt construction. The church has three naves and a bell tower raised with local stones, characterized as being of modest size, redness and unpolished. It has a transept in the center holding the dome on arches.

Early life Calmes was born in Corregidor, an island in Manila Bay that is legally part of Cavite City, in 1940; however, her family returned to the United States the same year she was born. Her father, a graduate of West Point military academy, was killed in 1944 while fighting in World War II, leaving her mother to raise three children. Calmes and her two brothers all suffered from polio at a young age, which served as her inspiration for going into a medical career. She attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, where she was encouraged to further her education instead of settling down and starting a family. She applied to Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas and was one of three women accepted to a class of 84 students. Adult life and career Previously Selma Harrison, she married one of her classmates the summer after her freshman year at Baylor College of Medicine and became Selma Harrison Calmes in 1958. She graduated from Baylor in 1965 and initially began an internship in pediatrics, which was the most common specialty for female physicians at the time. However, she read an essay by Dr. Virginia Apgar that promoted anesthesiology as a specialty for women physicians with children and began a residency in anesthesiology in 1966 at the University of Pennsylvania. She was the only female resident in the program, which was leading in anesthesiology training during this time. The same year she gave birth to her first child and during the second year of her residency she became pregnant again. After completing her residency in 1969, Calmes became a staff anesthesiologist and instructor in Pennsylvania until 1970, when she moved to California, which remains her current place of residence. There, she took a position as staff anesthesiologist at Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno. Calmes was greatly inspired by her peers, other women physicians, and wrote various articles on Dr. Virginia Apgar, who had originally inspired her to pursue anesthesiology, as well as articles about women's history in anesthesiology. In 1982 she co-founded the Anesthesia History Association.

Marbury, \\"The High Court of Chancery and the Chancellors of Maryland\\", Report of the Tenth Annual Meeting of the Maryland State Bar Association, (1905), p. 137-155. According to the author, much of the material in this report was taken from a manuscript dated \\"Winter of 1851-3\\", written by Charles W. Hanson, son of Senator Alexander Contee Hanson, and grandson of Chancellor Hanson. Early life Alexander Contee Hanson was born in Maryland on October 22, 1749. He was the eldest son of John Hanson and Jane (née Contee) Hanson. His father was a Revolutionary War financier and statesman, who was a signer of the Articles of Confederation and first President of the Congress created by those Articles. Alexander Hanson was educated at the College of Philadelphia and read law in Annapolis. His brother, Peter Contee Hanson, died in the battle of Fort Washington during the War. His paternal grandparents were Samuel Hanson and Elizabeth (née Storey) Hanson. Career After his legal education, he planned to travel to England to be ordained for the ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, but his voyage ended in a shipwreck. He was rescued and taken to Philadelphia, where he became the Assistant Private Secretary to General George Washington. Hanson's cousin, and the future appointee to the Chancellorship, Colonel Robert Hanson Harrison was Washington's Chief Secretary. In 1776, Hanson fell ill, and after two months service, had to leave General Washington's service. Hanson visited headquarters just after the battle of Brandywine, and was present when the two armies, just on the eve of battle, were separated by a violent rain. Still very ill, Hanson accompanied Washington to a farmer's house, where Washington offered him his bed. Alexander Hamilton lay down on the floor in the corner, and afterwards Colonel Hanson would good-humoredly remark that he \\"never saw a man look so like a cat\\". On February 12, 1778, Hanson returned to Annapolis with Governor William Paca and Nicholas Thomas. Hanson was then appointed Judge of the General Court under the Constitution of 1776. In 1784, with Samuel Chase, he was appointed to digest Laws of Maryland from 1763. This work was done by himself and is known as \\"Hanson's Laws.\\" =Pamphlet writings= During this period, Hanson took great interest in public affairs, and wrote a number of valuable pamphlets on both State and Federal questions, which attracted much notice. These pamphlets, which have been collected by the Maryland Historical Society, are as follows: *Political Schemes and Calculations, 1784, on public credit; *Considerations on the Proposed Removal of the Seat of Government, February 1786, what he considered to be his masterpiece in this field of literature; *Remarks on the Proposed Plan of an Emission of Paper and on the Means of Effecting it, December 1786; *Remarks on the Proposed Plan of a Federal Government, 1787, which, as the preceding, was written over the signature of \\"Aristides\\"; *Address of the Visitors and Governors of St. John's College to the Senate of Maryland, 1794. These papers have been collected in the original prints and bound together by the Maryland Historical Society. All of them contain notes made by Chancellor Hanson in his own handwriting, from time to time up to his death. These throw a great deal of light upon public questions and the character of the public men of that day. In this same volume is a valuable manuscript from the hand of Charles W. Hanson, son of Senator Alexander Contee Hanson, and grandson of the Chancellor, giving a sketch of his life and much information about his family. =Court Judge= Hanson's reputation as a Judge rests principally upon his services upon the General Court Bench, because, although he was for nearly 18 years Chancellor of the State, there is no report of his decisions. The only record of his labors is what is given in the Court of Appeals' Reports when cases were taken from the High Court of Chancery to that Court on appeal. Here sometimes an opinion will be found, but more generally a short statement of his decree. He delivered many opinions in the General Court, which are reported in Harris & McHenry's Reports, and these have been said to \\"amply attest his learning and ability\\". Marbury writes: > \\"I will call especial attention to the case of Calvert vs. Eden, 2 H. & > McH., 334, as being of great interest. From the report of this case I should > suppose that it must have been one of the greatest legal battles in the > history of our courts. This case raised many interesting questions in the > law of real property, as a glance at the head notes will show, and gave a > magnificent opportunity for the famous lawyers engaged in the case to > display their erudition and eloquence. Cook & Jennings were for the > plaintiff and J. T. Chase and Luther Martin for the defendants. A number of > opinions by Daniel Dulany were filed in the case, and an opinion by the > famous Francis Hargrave, of Lincoln's Inn (author of notes upon Coke > Littleton) and John Hall, all of which are published in the report of the > case. Judge Hanson delivered the opinion in this case and an appeal from the > General Court to the Court of Appeals he was affirmed without any other > opinion being rendered. This case involved many points of interest and > importance, but as they are succinctly stated in the head notes of the case, > I will not attempt to state them here. As an illustration of the regard in > which the opinions of Chancellor Hanson were held I may refer to the case of > Damarest vs. Wynkoop. The opinion in this case was delivered by > Chancellor Kent, and the question was one similar to Lamar vs. Clarke, 3 H. > & McH., 338, a question of limitations. The decree of Chancellor Hanson was > reversed by the Court of Appeals in the latter case. Chancellor Kent, in the > case first mentioned, adopted the view of Hanson instead of that of the > Court of Appeals, and in doing so used this language: \\"This is clear > judicial sanction to the doctrine of Lord Talbot, and, therefore, as well > upon authority as upon the reason and policy of the rule I conclude that the > Court of Appeals of Maryland was in this instance mistaken; and with respect > to the learned Chancellor's opinion, notwithstanding the reversal, I trust I > may without offense be permitted to say 'Scaevolve assentior.' \\" This case > and Chancellor Hanson's opinion were afterwards adopted by the Court of > Appeals in Hertie vs. Schwartze, 3 Md., 383, where its former decision was > overruled.\\" =Chancellor of Maryland= On October 3, 1789, Hanson was appointed to succeed John Rogers, deceased, Chancellor of the State of Maryland. This appointment was made after the place had been offered to Robert Hanson Harrison, who was at that time Judge of the General Court, but had been offered a seat on the Supreme Court of the United States. Harrison was strongly urged by Alexander Hamilton to accept the appointment, and finally declined the Chancellorship for this reason, but died on his way to take his seat. Hanson was about this time himself offered a United States district court judgeship, but declined. While serving as Chancellor, Hanson was a member of the Convention called to consider the proposed Constitution of the United States. He was a strong advocate of its adoption. In 1789, he was appointed to digest the Testamentary Laws of the State. He was a Presidential Elector in both of the elections of General Washington to the Presidency. He was a visitor of St. John's College and a great friend of that institution. In 1803, he was appointed to a committee to defend it against its adversaries. Personal life Chancellor Hanson was married to Rebecca Howard (1759–1806) of Annapolis. Together, they were the parents of three children: * Charles Wallace Hanson (1783–1853), a judge who married Rebecca Dorsey Ridgely (1786–1837) of Hampton, the eldest daughter of Charles Ridgely, governor of Maryland from 1815 to 1818. * Alexander Contee Hanson (1786–1819), who became a U.S. Senator and who married Priscilla Dorsey (1789–1849), daughter of Edward Dorsey and inheritor of the Belmont Estate. * Mary Jane Hanson (1791–1815), who married Thomas Peabody Grosvenor (1778–1817), a U.S. Representative from New York. Hanson seems to have been a religious man and of the kindest disposition. He was charitable, and many acts of kindness are related by his grandson. He took several young men under his care and treated them with a fatherly kindness. He died by a stroke of apoplexy January 16, 1806. =Honors= Chancellor Hanson received the degree of LL.D. from one of the Universities, but the identity of the institution is not known.

Much like her pioneering work The Dirty Girls Social Club, Make Him Look Good falls under the category of Chica lit and explores the p.o.v. of several Latina women as they seek success in their personal and professional lives. Summary The novel revolves loosely around Ricky Biscayne, a Miami based Latin pop-star who is on the verge of releasing his English-language cross-over album, and the women and men whose lives are connected to him. Milan Gotay, a 24-year-old laxative publicist and obsessive Ricky fan, forces her mother and sister to watch him perform on The Tonight Show prompting her successful older sister, Geneva, to pursue him as a sponsor for her new nightclub. The same performance causes Jill Sanchez, a famous singer and actress, to decide to dump her fiancé and re-establish her relationship with Ricky, despite the fact that he is newly married to a Serbian model, Jasminka. The performance also triggers Ricky, energized by his success to finally agree to impregnate Jasminka who is desperate to start a family to help her get over her eating disorder and the loss of her own family who were murdered in the Croatian War of Independence. Matthew Baker, Ricky's producer and friend who is responsible for writing and performing most of Ricky’s songs also watches the performance and is conflicted over Ricky's rising fame. During Geneva’s meeting with Ricky she realizes that he is being poorly managed and has him immediately sign a deal with her. She also suggests that he hire Milan after she learns his current publicist is going to jail. Ricky does hire Milan and decides to seduce her, especially when he realizes that his friend Matthew is infatuated with her. He tells Milan that he and his wife Jasminka have a sham marriage when in reality they are growing apart because she is gaining weight due to her pregnancy and the fact that his addiction to cocaine is making him increasingly paranoid and violent. As Ricky becomes more famous he draws the attention of Sophia, the 13-year-old daughter of single-mother Irene Gallagher. Irene, who works as a fire-fighter in a hostile work environment and struggles with money, tries to deny that Ricky is Sophia’s father, but Sophia convinced of her resemblance to the man, manages to sneak into his private compound where Jasminka lets her into the house. Ricky denies he is her father and, when Sophia talks to the press, convinces Milan to destroy both Irene and her daughter by portraying them as poor, money-hungry gold diggers who are desperate to steal his money. Jasminka goes to Ricky’s mother Alma who reveals that Irene and Ricky were childhood sweethearts and the child is his. Matthew also tells Jasminka that he is responsible for nearly the entirety of Ricky’s discography prompting her to leave him. He also tries to tell the same thing to Milan who thinks he is lying until she walks in on a recording session and realizes that he was telling the truth about singing and writing Ricky’s songs. At the opening night of Club G, Milan’s new club, Jill and Ricky perform terribly using their live vocals. Geneva and Milan also reveal to the journalists at Club G that Ricky is Sophia’s biological father after having a DNA test done to prove it. They decide to rename the club Club Sophia and follow up this revelation with a performance by Matt where he reveals he is the true artist behind Ricky’s image. In the aftermath Jasminka, Sophia and Alma grow close allowing Jasminka to finally have the family she’s longed for since her own was murdered. Irene’s image, now rebuilt by the fact that Ricky is Sophia’s father, is able to settle with her fire-department for sexual-discrimination and is offered a new job at a fire department with a woman chief. Milan struggles to manage Matthew’s career while working for her sister Geneva whom she has finally grown close to. Jill and Ricky, finally having left their partners to be with one another rebuild their careers with Jill advising Ricky to come clean about his drug addiction and past behaviour and claim he has found God. After Jasminka gives birth and invites everyone to celebrate her daughter with her at the hospital they see Ricky giving an interview claiming to have found Jesus and announcing plans for a country music album. The novel ends with Milan and Geneva on their way to their parents’ house to introduce them to their respective boyfriends whom they are sure their parents will disapprove of. They nevertheless promise to support one another. Characters * Milan Gotay a 24-year-old publicist who still lives at home and is obsessed with Ricky Biscane.

She made two voyages transporting convicts from England and Ireland to Australia. She plied between England, India, and Sierra Leone before being lost with all hands in 1823. Construction Hadlow was built for W. Parker & Co.; she was a two-deck full-rigged ship with a coppered hull, she was assessed at around 374 tons (bm). History A letter dated 28 April 1815 reported that she had re-registered at London.Library and Archives Canada Item: 30381: HADLOW. Having left London under the command of one Captain Davison on 27 May 1815, Hadlow sailed from Cromarty, Scotland, to the Hudson Bay in June with 34 colonists from Stromness and possibly Loch Eriboll. She arrived in York Factory on 26 August 1815 and left again on 7 September to winter at Strutton Sound. Hadlow arrived back in London on 4 November the following year. Described as \\"new built\\", Hadlow sailed from London for Bengal, India via Madeira, Portugal in February 1817 under the command of Captain Edward Lamb. During the return voyage from Calcutta, Captain Lamb died on 31 December 1817. Command of the ship was taken by Captain Anderson. Hadlow collided with the transport ship Wyton in the English Channel in April 1818. Hadlow appears in Lloyd's Register for 1818 with master Lamb, changing to J. Craigie, and trade London—India, changing to London—Botany Bay. In July 1818, Hadlow was fitted for the transportation of convicts at Deptford Dockyard, Kent. Her guard of a lieutenant and 32 troops of the 48th Regiment of Foot embarked on 17 July, along with six women and four children. She sailed to Woolwich, Kent on 30 July and took 50 male convicts from the prison hulk Justitia on 1 August. The next day, she sailed for Sheerness, Kent where she took 97 convicts from the prison hulks and Retribution. Hadlow departed from Sheerness for New South Wales on 22 August under the command of Captain John Craigie.Captain Craigie's surname also appears as \\"Craige\\" and \\"Cragie\\" in sources. The spelling \\"Craigie\\" has been adopted for this article. Having called in at the Cape of Good Hope en route, she arrived at Port Jackson on 23 December, and her cargo of 149 male convicts were turned over to the authorities there, one having died en route. A woman who had been taken on board at the Cape of Good Hope gave birth to a stillborn child shortly after arrival at Port Jackson and subsequently died. The convicts were disembarked on 4 January 1819 for inspection by Governor Macquarie. Hadlow departed from Sydney, New South Wales for Calcutta, India on or about 20 January 1819. She departed from Calcutta in late May 1819 for London, where she arrived in early December. Hadlow departed from Deptford on 20 February 1820 for Gravesend, where, on 23 February, she embarked a captain, sergeant and 32 privates of the 48th Regiment. She then sailed to Cobh, County Cork, to collect 150 male convicts, who were embarked on 23 March. Hadlow sailed on 2 April and arrived at Port Jackson on 5 August 1820. Two of her 150 convicts died en route. The convicts were disembarked on 15 August. Hadlow departed from Sydney on 15 September for Batavia, Netherlands East Indies. She returned from Batavia in October 1820 in company with Earl St. Vincent, Mangles and Neptune; between them the four ships had brought 603 convicts to Port Jackson. Hadlow sailed from London for Bombay, India on or about 10 October 1821. She arrived in April 1822. Hadlow departed from Bombay on 2 June 1822 and arrived in The Downs in mid-October. In 1823 she underwent a small repair. The Register of Shipping (1824), gave her master's name as Pounder, and her trade as London—Sierra Leone.Register of Shipping (1824), Seq.№14. Hadlow, Pounder, master, sailed from Gravesend for Sierra Leone on 14 March 1823. While she was at Sierra Leone, yellow fever broke out on Hadlow, killing four of her crew. The disease was brought to Sierra Leone either by the merchant ship Caroline or by . At the time, Hadlow was under the command of Captain Praguel, or Prangnell. Fate Hadlow departed for London on 31 August, but subsequently foundered with the loss of all hands. There was a report of her arriving in The Downs on 4 September 1823, but this is clearly an error.

The plan called for a storming party of volunteers to build a bridge across a moat and plant scaling ladders against the enemy embankment in advance of the main attack. This was diversionary charge on the Confederate position known as the Stockade Redan – a charge that was intended to draw fire away from the real planned attack. The volunteers knew the odds were against survival and the mission was called, in nineteenth century vernacular, a \\"forlorn hope\\". Only single men were accepted as volunteers and even then, twice as many men as needed came forward and were turned away. The assault began in the early morning following a naval bombardment.

It is a Microsoft Windows- based operating system using the Hyper-V virtual machine monitor and contains separate operating systems for games and applications that can run on the console. It is located on the internal HDD for day-to-day usage, while also being duplicated on the internal NAND storage of the console for recovery purposes and factory reset functionality. The Xbox One allows users to download applications that add to the functionality of the dashboard. From June 2014 onwards, entertainment apps no longer required the user to be signed into a valid Xbox Live Gold account in order to use the features advertised for the given app. Since launch, Microsoft has been updating the OS monthly, with updates downloaded from the Xbox Live service directly to the Xbox One and subsequently installed, or by using offline recovery images downloaded via a PC. In November 2015, a major system update known as the New Xbox One Experience was released, which brought very significant changes to the design and functionality of the system.Xbox One's New Update Possibly Most Significant in Console History, Microsoft Says The Windows 10-based Core had replaced the Windows 8-based one in this update, and the new system is sometimes referred to as \\"Windows 10 on Xbox One\\".Xbox One Is \\"Literally a Windows Device\\"New Xbox One Update Will Make Some Functionality 50 Percent Faster Technology =System= The Xbox One console runs on an operating system that includes the Windows 10 core, although initially it included the Windows 8 core at the Xbox One's release. The Xbox One system software contains a heavily modified Hyper-V hypervisor (known as NanoVisor) as its host OS and two partitions. One of the partitions, the \\"Exclusive\\" partition is a custom virtual machine (VM) for games; the other partition, the \\"Shared\\" partition is a custom VM for running multiple apps. The Shared Partition contained the Windows 8 Core at launch until November 2015, where via a system update known as the \\"New Xbox One Experience\\", it was upgraded to the Windows 10 Core. With Windows 10, Universal Windows Platform apps became available on Xbox One. According to the current head of Microsoft's Gaming division, Phil Spencer, \\"The importance of entertainment and games to the Windows ecosystem has become really prevalent to the company\\".PHIL SPENCER IS OBLITERATING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN XBOX AND PC, AND HE'S JUST GETTING STARTED The program that Microsoft launched allows developers to build a single app that can run on a wide variety of devices, including personal computers and Xbox One video game consoles.Windows 10 bringing universal Windows apps to Xbox One According to Polygon, Microsoft removed the distinction between Xbox One and Windows PC. Starting in February 2014, Microsoft invited select users to join a preview program that enables them to receive early builds of upcoming system updates and experiment with the features prior to the public launch of the software. Once registered for the Xbox One Preview Program, participants can test the early features included in the update, provide feedback on a private forum and can opt out of future waves. Through its Xbox Feedback website, Microsoft has been soliciting input from consumers on its features and taking requests for future additions to the console. Low battery notifications and Blu-ray 3D support are two examples of ideas that have been among the top vote-getters on the site. =User interface= The Xbox One system software's interface uses a geometrical placement of squares and rectangular items that scrolls as a continuous vertical line, using the Metro design language that is also seen in Windows 8, Windows 10, and other Microsoft products.The Xbox One Proves Microsoft Needs to Reign In Metro By default, the dashboard is divided into \\"Home\\", \\"Community\\", \\"Mixer\\", \\"Game Pass\\" and \\"Store\\" sections; the \\"Home\\" section contains a recent apps and games list. The \\"Community\\" section allows users to view their friends' in-game activities and captures, post status updates, as well as view trending content. The \\"Mixer\\" section shows an overview on streams on Microsoft's own Mixer service, while the \\"Store\\" section serves as a portal to the games, video, music, and app marketplaces. In general, the top level menu of the Xbox One feels a lot less cluttered than the Xbox 360's dashboard. For example, the friends tab has been removed and replaced with a dedicated app that users can load up to see what their connections are doing. There are a couple of columns for settings options and an area for \\"pinned\\" favorites, a \\"main\\" screen showing current and recent apps and games that the user played or used, and a small \\"What's New\\" section highlighting some recently added content. In total, the interface is very clean and sparse.Xbox One interface a clean slate inspired by Windows 8 Microsoft also introduced a new way to multitask called Snap, which allows Xbox One users to open multiple panes in a single window. When Microsoft upgraded the Windows 8-based Core to a Windows 10-based one, they made a tour of the new user interface up on Xbox Wire, promising faster, easier navigation, improved community features and, the return of Xbox Avatars. The main feature on the home screen is a list of the most recently played games. Selecting any given title will give users more information about announcements, achievements, social activity and so forth. It is also more focused on the actual games they are playing, which is part and parcel of the company's new direction under Phil Spencer, the current head of Microsoft's Xbox division.Microsoft Is Totally Redesigning The Xbox One User Interface =Multimedia features= While like other video game consoles the Xbox One is primarily designed for playing games, it is more than a game console. It is an entertainment hub for games, television, music, and videos. Mainly the console focuses on functionality and entertainment as a whole. At Gamescom 2014 Microsoft unveiled a new plan to remedy this and make earnest on the Xbox One's label as the \\"all-in-one entertainment\\" solution by way of expanding its media support. The Xbox One's media player is quite similar to the Xbox 360's playback suite in terms of form and function, however the newer console now supports more than 30 formats including the MKV container and GIF files. The Xbox One console also does some unique things. For example, its owners can control their television broadcasts using the device, as well as use it as a functioning DVR.PLAYSTATION 4 VS XBOX ONE: GAMING OR MULTIMEDIA? Apart from streaming music and videos via Play (Charms > Devices > Play), there is also a networked approach. There are two primary ways to do this. The first is to stream media from a computer or tablet, and the second is to play it directly off of a USB flash drive. The advantage of this method over the Play system is that users can do it all from wherever they sit via the Xbox One, instead of sending the video from a PC to their console.How to stream your video collection from a PC to the Xbox One Aside from multimedia files, Xbox One plays CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, and it also comes with DLNA and MKV support, which means that downloaded video files can be streamed via the PC or transported via external hard drive and USBs. Meanwhile, the interactive TV Guide allows users to turn on and control a television with their voice. Furthermore, the system comes with a comprehensive range of applications related to multimedia features. In the United States, video channels include for example the Amazon Instant Video, Crackle, Hulu Plus and Netflix. Microsoft had announced that the Xbox One was awarded for its multimedia capabilities at the 66th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards in early 2015, and the prize was given for the Xbox One's television-on-demand functions.Xbox One Wins Emmy For Media Capabilities =Backward compatibility= The Xbox One was not backward compatible with either the original Xbox or the Xbox 360 console at launch, and Microsoft had admitted that attempts to use cloud streaming to allow Xbox 360 games to be played on Xbox One proved to be \\"problematic\\". However, during its E3 press conference on June 15, 2015, Microsoft announced plans to introduce Xbox 360 backward compatibility using the software method on the Xbox One. Supported Xbox 360 games are supposed to run within a software emulator provided by the updated system software, implementing both the hardware and software of the Xbox 360. Xbox One recording and broadcasting features are supported along with Xbox 360 multiplayer, achievements and cloud save access. Unlike Xbox 360's emulation of the original Xbox, games do not have to be specifically patched but need to be repackaged in the Xbox One format. Users' digitally-purchased games will automatically appear in their library for download once available. Games on physical media are not executed directly from disc; inserting the disc initiates a download of a repackaged version. As with Xbox One titles, the disc must be inserted during play for validation purposes. At least 100 Xbox 360 games are officially supported and available for the feature's public launch alongside the November 2015 \\"New Xbox One Experience\\" system update, and Xbox One preview program members received early access with a limited number of titles upon the announcement. Microsoft expected the number of supported games to increase significantly over time, but not all Xbox 360 games will be supported—this explicitly includes any games that require Kinect or access to USB peripherals. Xbox division head Phil Spencer has stated that the idea of possibly adding support for games from the original Xbox was not \\"silly\\", but that the Xbox division is focusing on Xbox 360 compatibility first. On June 11, 2017, Microsoft announced that there would be backwards compatibility for the original Xbox. On June 10, 2019, Microsoft announced that it had wound down the addition of new titles to the program, in order to focus on backward compatibility efforts for the Xbox Series X. =Development= At the 2016 Build conference, it was announced that all Xbox One consoles could be updated to include a development kit for universal Windows applications on Xbox One, with official support for the platform and Cortana coming in summer 2016. History of updates Along with introducing improvements and fixes for native console apps and software, the monthly updates to the Xbox One system software introduce major features that are voted on or requested by the community, though some months have included more than one update. Starting in February 2014, beta releases of updates are tested before going live to check for unwanted bugs and stability. On the day of the console's launch in 2013, a system update was released to remove the controversial always-online DRM announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013. This DRM would have required the Xbox One to connect to the Internet at least once every twenty-four hours, or else games would cease to function. After a wave of backlash from gamers and the press alike, Microsoft was forced to reverse its policies regarding this, but early users had to go online at least once to receive this patch. The February 2014 update introduced the ability to see how much hard disk space is available. It also introduced support for USB keyboards, enabling users to plug a keyboard into their console, thus eliminating the need to use the on-screen keyboard. Over a year later, in July 2015, Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox team, vowed that mouse support would be added sometime in the future as part of cross-platform gameplay between Windows 10 devices and the Xbox One console. The March 2014 update added support for video output at 50 frames per second rather than 60, allowing smoother video on 50 Hz displays common in Europe. In the United States, refresh rates on screens are higher (60 Hz) than in Europe. In June 2014, support was added for external hard drives of 256 gigabytes or more, allowing two to be connected to the console at a time via USB 3.0. As part of the July 2014 update, consoles could better understand voice commands spoken in different accents and dialects of English and German. A month later, purchases from the official Xbox website and the SmartGlass app were enabled, allowing for easier content purchasing. In the October 2014 update, a media player app was added with support for many formats and codecs, including the Matroska container, as well as DLNA streaming from other networked devices. In March 2015, a new screenshot feature was added to the console along with tile transparency, allowing owners to share game screenshots online or use one as a menu background. In April 2015, due to criticisms of the power consumption needed for the Instant-On feature, a system update prompted users to select between Instant-On and an energy saving mode. Instant-On had been enabled by default in the U.S., drawing criticism from the Natural Resources Defense Council. During the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 in June, Microsoft discussed three major features that later came to Xbox One consoles in November 2015: Windows 10 streaming, Xbox 360 backward compatibility, and an interface redesign known as the New Xbox One Experience. In advance of the public release of Windows 10, a July 2015 update let users stream games from their Xbox One to any device running Windows 10, a feature announced in January 2015. The service streams only to one device at a time. In the February 2016 update, a slew of new features became available. For example, global leaderboards for each game and the ability to hide unused or expired beta games, and demos from a user's game collection. The February 2016 update allowed users to rearrange their customized 'pins' via the controller, whereas previously users had to use the Xbox One SmartGlass application to use this feature. The March 2016 update builds on the features that were introduced in the February 2016 update. New features that were included in the March 2016 update were the ability to purchase Xbox 360 compatible games on the Xbox One, party chat while broadcasting Twitch streams, and customizable DVR recording lengths, which means that owners can now record a clip that is up to 5 minutes long. Other improvements included the ability to track achievement progress from the Xbox One guide, video playback from the Xbox One activity feed, the ability to have 16 people in a party chat, and the ability to track Xbox 360 achievements on the Xbox One activity feed. Further improvements in the March 2016 update include the ability to launch web links and YouTube videos directly from the Game Hubs and the ability for a user to compare their avatars to their friends. Additionally, the update also introduces the ability to factory reset the console without deleting installed games and applications. On June 6, 2016, the first preview update of the Windows 10 Anniversary update was made available to participants of the preview program. This included many new features and enhancements to the software. Build 14352 was one of the first builds to introduce Cortana. The main aim of this was to help users undertake certain tasks, such as setting up a party using voice commands. Unlike the older Kinect voice commands, Cortana gives users audio feedback to the commands, similar to the PC and Windows Mobile versions. The update also included a refreshed design of the Xbox store, further cementing the relationship between Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs, as well as a redesigned 'My Games & Apps' interface, which includes a vertical design rather than the older horizontal design. The 'My Games & Apps' interface in build 14352 also gives the user more information when downloading games and apps such as the percentage completed, the current download size, total download size and the current download speed. The June 2016 update also includes a new 'Facebook Friend Finder', which allows users to find and add friends on Facebook on Xbox Live. The final release to the public was published on July 30, 2016 to coincide with the release of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, which was released a few days later on August 2, 2016. The final release introduced the newly redesigned universal store, as well as further integration of the Universal Windows Platform. On March 29, 2017, an update was released to the public. Known as the Creators Update to coincide with the PC version, released a few weeks later on April 6, 2017. It was released to Xbox Insiders in late February 2017 for testing and evaluation. The Creators Update featured a number of updates, including a refreshed homepage design, a new guide design, new video and screenshot capture controls as well as a new game streaming service called Beam. Accessibility was also improved by a new feature called Microsoft Co-Pilot that allows users with physical impairments to 'hook' up a second controller to allow a friend to assist them with controls. Tapping the Xbox Guide button no longer takes the user back to their home screen, but instead opens the guide. This represents a significant design paradigm shift compared to older releases. On October 16, 2017, the Fall Update was released. Major changes include a UI overhaul using Microsoft's Fluent Design System, a modular Home menu, a faster dashboard, a content transfer feature, support for USB webcams, a new Guide menu, improvements to the game DVR, and several other miscellaneous functionality and interface tweaks. On April 24, 2018, the April Xbox Update was released. Changes include new video features Auto Low-Latency Mode, support for a variable refresh rate output to AMD Radeon FreeSync and FreeSync 2 compatible displays. In addition, Xbox One X and Xbox One S now support output at 2560 x 1440 (1440p) resolution for games and media, improvements to Mixer with Share Controller and the option to start Mixer broadcasts from anywhere on Xbox One, share captured screenshots and clips directly to Twitter, several audio improvements, Community tournaments are now available directly in Game Hubs for supported games and Club feeds have also gained new filters.https://majornelson.com/2018/04/24/the-april-xbox-update- begins-rolling-out-today/ On May 18, 2018, the May Xbox Update was released. Changes include support for a 120 Hz refresh rate, a powerful new enhancement to Pins called \\"Groups\\", with which users can create multiple collections of content made up of anything from within My games & apps, trim their recent game captures directly from the Guide, improved Family Settings, improvements to the Xbox Accessories app and several other changes to some of the button commands throughout the dashboard.https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/04/20/may- xbox-update/ Additionally, an update added captive portal support to the console, allowing users to connect to wireless networks requiring authentication, commonly used in colleges, hotels as well as wireless hotspots provided by internet service providers.https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/xbox-one-insider-build-party- overlay/ Microsoft aims to release frequent updates to the Xbox One console, mainly containing new or improved features and faster installation and loading times for games and apps. The largest of which was in November 2015, named the New Xbox Experience update. On June 13, 2020, a Tweet was published by Tom Warren from the Verge stating that Microsoft will use the same operating system on the Xbox Series X with a \\"few additional changes\\". These changes included a 40% reduction of memory in various features that help to speed up the UI. Additional changes will include rounded UI interface elements, a more readable font, and improved sharing interactions. These improvements will be added not only for the Xbox Series X system software but will also be incorporated into the Xbox One software and into the Xbox Game Bar for Windows and the Xbox mobile app. On 19 August 2020, Microsoft provided a glimpse into what Microsoft dubs the \\"New Xbox Experience\\", further refining its console dashboard, new rebuilt Store and its much-welcomed visual refinements employing Microsoft's Fluent Design System. Changes include animated background images, font overhauls, guide changes and a tile design refresh. Microsoft also provided a glimpse into a new Xbox store design refresh to complement the \\"New Xbox Experience\\".

Topics range from the work of specific authors to major trends in feminism and science fiction. Through all of these different topics, Russ underlines the importance of celebrating the work of female authors and turning a critical eye on the commentaries and work produced by men. The collection is split up into two sections. Part One focuses on the critique of masculinist writing and male authorship, while Part Two focuses on the work of female authors and their relationship to writing.

History  Ruben Costas, governor of Santa Cruz department, announced the party's formation in March 2013. Twenty leaders gathered to launch the party in April 2013, including Costas, Beni governor Carmelo Lens and his predecessor Ernesto Suarez, Senator Bernard Gutierrez (PPB-Cochabamba), and Cochabamba council member Ninoska Lazarte. The launch was hosted by Savina Cuéllar, the former prefect of Chuquisaca Department, who as of April 2013, was under house arrest facing charges for the May 24, 2008, violence in Sucre. After a failed petition to legally merge the registration of Costas' Truth and Social Democracy (VERDES) party, Renewing Freedom and Democracy (Libertad y Democracia Renovadora; Líder), and Popular Consensus in June, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal authorized Popular Consensus to rename itself the Democrat Social Movement in August 2013. MDS participated in the 2014 election in alliance with the National Unity Front (UN), supporting the presidential candidacy of Samuel Doria Medina, electing 4 Deputies and one senator. In the 2019 election, MDS broke its alliance with Unidad Nacional and supported the presidential candidacy of Oscar Ortiz, while UN supported Carlos Mesa. Party member and opposition Senator Jeanine Áñez became interim president of Bolivia in November 2019, following the Evo Morales government resignation. This move was contested by senators for the Movement for Socialism (MAS), Morales's party, who were majority in the assembly and were not in attendance, and thus stated that the vote for interim president took place without a quorum. However, the move was upheld by the Plurinational Constitutional Court, which stated that it followed the succession mechanism stated in the Constitution of Bolivia.

The church's formal address is 448 East 116th Street, although the entrance to the church building is on East 115th Street, just off Pleasant Avenue. The parish enshrines a vested statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, widely venerated by its devotees. Pope Leo XIII granted the image a Canonical Coronation on 12 May 1903. Pope Pius X carried over the Pontifical decree and donated a gemstone for the crown to which the ceremony occurred on 10 July 1904. It is one of the four canonically crowned images authorized by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in the United States of America. History The church itself was constructed in 1884 by Reverend Emil Kirner of the Pallottine Fathers and Brothers. At the time, the parishioners held mass at East 111th street until the completion of the shrine in 1885. The church at the time cost $40,000 USD though did not formally open until 7 August 1887. The former shrine became populated with incoming Italian and Bohemian congregants and Our Lady of Mount Carmel was the second Italian parish in New York City and the first Southern Italian parish. Since the first feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel on 16 July 1881, its annual feast has been a major event in East Harlem, at one time attended by more than 100,000. The church cornerstone was laid on September 20, 1884. A new school and gymnasium were added to the church on September 1, 1965. The parish shrine of the Virgin Mary was crowned by in the name of the Pope on 10 July 1904. Our Lady of Mount Carmel image The parish church enshrines an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary venerated under the title of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, brought by an Italian immigrant and saloon owner, Antonio Petrucci from Polla, in Salerno, Italy. The statue replaces a poster image used by Italian immigrants devotees who first settled in the area. The image, garnering devotion was authorised to crown by Pope Leo XIII by a pontifical decree dated 12 May 1903. Pope Pius X approved the Canonical coronation under his pontificate by granting an Emerald gemstone on 10 July 1904 via Archbishop John Murphy Farley, which was held in Thomas Jefferson Park to accommodate the large number of pilgrims. The image is widely venerated by its faithful, who sometimes refer to the image as the Madonna of East Harlem. Today Every year on the second weekend of August, the Giglio Society of East Harlem holds an Italian festival on the streets around the Our Lady of Mt Carmel Church. The festival or \\"feast\\" includes the Society performing the \\"Dancing Giglio\\". The dancing of the Giglio is an Italian tradition which began over 125 years ago on the streets of East Harlem. In 2013, the parish was placed under the care of the Polish Pallottine fathers. The church currently offers masses in English, Spanish, Polish and Latin. Since 2015 the pastor of the parish is Rev. Marian Wierzchowski.

He had obtained £10,000 from New Zealand investors, and borrowed taonga or cherished tribal artifacts from the Māori cast. He had fired Alfred Hill who was to write the music, and Ted Coubray the original cameraman, but sold Coubray's camera to his rivals the Welsh brothers.

She was one of the first woman who rode for the United States Equestrian Team (USET), the first licensed female jockey, and the first American woman to win an Olympic medal in equestrian competition.  Early life  Kathryn \\"Kathy\\" Kusner was born in Gainesville, Florida, on March 21, 1940. Her mother was a teacher and her father was a pilot in the Air Force. She grew up with a natural affinity for horses, searching for them in fields throughout her childhood days. When she first saw a horse show, she immediately knew that she wanted to ride horses for the rest of her life. However, because she did not come from a well- connected or wealthy family, she could not buy her own horse. Instead, Kusner spent her time working at the stables for $2 an afternoon. More importantly though, Kusner could ride horses and take lessons. Her riding and jumping skills quickly grew, and soon Kusner was being noticed by horse dealers. She spent much of her high school years completely immersed in the world of horses, riding and performing in shows and ring events as well as showing horses for horse dealers. Although she began by riding \\"their most raggedy rough horses,\\" getting any and every experience she could, she rose to ride better horses, even riding the best jumper in the United States at the time. Since the age of 16, Kusner also participated in unrecognized flat and timber races, where she often won.  Equestrian career  In 1958, when Kusner was 18, she was invited to the United States Equestrian Team trials. Two years later, she was named \\"Horsewoman of the Year\\" by the American Horse Shows Association. In 1961 at age 21, Kusner officially joined the United States Equestrian Team as the first woman member in 10 years. She helped win a team gold medal for the 1963 Pan-Am Games in San Paulo and represented the United States in the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. In 1967, she brought a team silver medal at the Pan-Am Games in Winnipeg and in 1968, she represented the United States for the Olympics in Mexico. 1967 also marked the year when Kusner applied for a jockey license through the Maryland Racing Commission but was denied because she was a woman. In an interview with Makers, Kusner noted that \\"I never, ever thought about being a woman until it was time to get a jock's license.\\" At this time, Kusner was an internationally acclaimed equestrian but could not legally compete in American races without a jockey license. Kusner and her lawyer took her case to court, and in 1968 Judge Ernest A. Loveless of the Circuit Court of Prince Georges County ordered her to be granted the license.https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/laurel/ph-ll-female- jockey-0523-story.html Kusner thus became the first licensed female jockey in the United States in October of 1968.https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/laurel/ph-ll-female- jockey-0523-story.html After taking time off in 1969 from a broken leg, Kusner won a silver medal in the 1972 Munich Olympics and became the first American woman to win an Olympic medal in equestrian competition. Now a licensed jockey, she competed in races from Canada to Mexico, Germany, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Panama, South Africa, and what was then Rhodesia. She was also the first woman to ride in the Maryland Hunt Cup, the toughest timber race in the world. In 1990, Kusner was inducted into The Show Jumping Hall of Fame.  Horses in the Hood  In 1990, Kusner founded the organization, Horses in the Hood (HHLA), which brought at-risk inner-city children in the Los Angeles area to a five-day horse and riding camp. By the end of October 2014, it was recorded that over 928 at risk children and adults have taken part in 91 horse camps through HHLA. The camps allowed children to work with horses and develop emotional and personal bonds through learning the care and riding of horses.  Later life  Although Kusner no longer competes, she continues to leave her legacy as a renowned equestrian by giving riding clinics all over the world. Beyond the show ring, she has worked as an expert witness concerning horse-related issues since 1983, a course designer both nationally and internationally, a television commentator for Grand Prix show jumping events and a writer for well-known equestrian journals. Her impact and work has had her featured in a variety of television shows, books, articles and a 2005 Library of Congress publication, Women Who Dare. She was even featured in the Disney movie, The Horse in the Grey Flannel Suit, for long riding shots. Outside of the horse world, Kusner is a licensed pilot with commercial, multi- engine, instrument, seaplane, and commercial glider ratings. She obtained a Lear Jet-type rating, for the Lear 23 and 24, and became the first woman to work as a Lear Jet pilot for Executive Jet Aviation, which was the largest jet charter company in the world at that time. She is also a skilled flying acrobat, an experienced scuba, and an active marathon runner. She has completed 122 marathons as of September 2014 and 73 ultramarathons, including 20 races of 50 miles or longer.

Career  Kim Myhr (born 1981) is an active voice of the creative music scene in Norway, both as a composer and as a guitarist, with frequent performances throughout Europe, Australia, Asia and North- as well as South-America. As a composer, Myhr wrote \\"stems and cages\\" for the Trondheim Jazz Orchestra in 2009, a large ensemble including Sidsel Endresen, Christian Wallumrød, Jim Denley among others. The music was released on the CD \\"stems and cages\\" in 2010. Kim wrote a second piece for the orchestra for the 2012 Ultima festival called \\"In the end his voice will be the sound of paper\\", this time featuring the voice of Jenny Hval. Myhr works frequently with dance, notably writing music for productions by Italian choreographer Francesco Scavetta, and in 2014 a new collaboration with dancer Orfee Schuijt. Myhr's first solo record \\"All your limbs singing\\" was released March 2014. His solo music explores the acoustic possibilities of the 12-string guitar, and can remind the listener of early music of Ligeti and of Morton Feldman, but it also contains an energy and simplicity similar to American folk music. Myhr is also one third of MURAL, a trio with Australian wind player Jim Denley and percussionist Ingar Zach.

After showing promise as a two-year-old in 1979, Cairn Rouge improved to become one of the best three-year-old fillies in Europe in the following year. She won the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the Coronation Stakes against horses of her own age and sex, before defeating strong weight-for-age competition in the Champion Stakes. She failed to win in five starts as a four-year-old, but showed good form when finishing second in a controversial race for the Champion Stakes. After a brief, unsuccessful period racing in North America she was retired to stud, where she had some success as a broodmare. Background Cairn Rouge was a small, lightly built, dark-coated bay mare with a white star bred in Ireland by Janet Brady. She was one of the second crop of foals sired by the Goodwood Mile winner Pitcairn, who also sired Ela-Mana-Mou before being exported to Japan in 1978. She was the first foal of dam Little Hills, who won on the flat and over hurdles. Little Hills' grand-dam Stone Crop was a half-sister of the Ascot Gold Cup winner Zarathustra. As a yearling, Cairn Rouge was sent to the sales, but was bought back by her breeders for 3000 guineas. She was sent into training with Michael Cunningham, who was best known for his successes in National Hunt races. Racing career =1979: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced in a one-mile race on her debut, Cairn Rouge won a maiden race over eight and a half furlongs at Galway Racecourse in September, beating Cassia by four lengths. In October she was sent to England to contest the Malton Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse. She accelerated into the lead a furlong from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Miss Taymore and Louise Moulton. =1980: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Cairn Rouge finished unplaced in a race over seven furlongs on very heavy ground on 17 March. In April she won the Mulcahy Stakes over seven furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse, beating the highly regarded Monroe by three lengths. Cairn Rouge was then moved up in class for the Irish 1,000 Guineas at the Curragh on 26 May in which she was matched against the leading English fillies Mrs Penny and Millingdale Lillie. Ridden by Tony Murray, she started at odds of 5/1 in a field of eighteen fillies. Cairn Rouge took the lead inside the final quarter mile and accelerated clear of the field to win decisively by two and a half lengths from Millingdale Lillie. In June, the filly was sent to England for the Coronation Stakes (then a Group Two race) over one mile at Royal Ascot in which she faced the 1000 Guineas winner Quick As Lightning at level weights. Ridden by Murray, Cairn Rouge started the 6/5 favourite and produced a strong late run on the inside to win by a neck from Quick As Lightning. At York on 19 August, Cairn Rouge was matched against colts and older horses for the first time in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs. The filly took the lead in the last quarter mile but was overtaken in the final strides and was beaten half a length by Master Willie. She was then sent to France and moved up in distance for the Prix Vermeille over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in September. Racing on ground which was firmer than she had previously encountered she fifth in a very strong field behind Mrs Penny, Little Bonny, Detroit and Gold River. Cairn Rouge's final appearance of the season came in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse in October when she started at odds of 6/1. Murray restrained the filly before producing her with a strong late run in the final quarter mile. She took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three-quarters of a length from Master Willie, with Nadjar in third and Rankin in fourth place. =1981: four- year-old season= In April 1981, Cairn Rouge was bought for $1.5 million by Craig Singer of Lewisville, Texas. Cairn Rouge began her three-year-old season at Royal Ascot in June, when she started favourite for the Prince of Wales's Stakes but finished fifth behind Hard Fought. The filly returned from the race with a minor injury which kept her off the racecourse for three months. She returned in the Desmond Stakes at the Curragh over one mile in which she was beaten a short head by the three-year-old colt Belted Earl. In October Cairn Rouge attempted to repeat her 1980 win in the Champion Stakes in a field which included To-Agori-Mou, Master Willie, Madam Gay and The Wonder. She ran on strongly in the last quarter mile to finish second, two lengths behind the French-trained three-year-old Vayrann. The winner failed a post-race drug test, but was allowed to keep the race following a private session of the Jockey Club's disciplinary committee on 7 June 1982. Cairn Rouge was sent to race in the United States in late 1981, where she was trained by George Getz. On 7 November she finished fourth behind Providential, April Run and Galaxy Libra in the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. In December she finished sixth behind Super Moment in the Bay Meadows Handicap. Assessment In 1979, the independent Timeform organisation gave Cairn Rouge a rating of 99, twenty- one pounds below the top-rated two-year-old filly Aryenne. In 1980 she was rated 127 by Timeform, four pounds below the top-rated three-year-old filly Detroit. In the official International Classification she was rated the fourth best three-year-old filly in Europe behind Detroit, Mrs Penny and Shoot A Line. She was also the highest-rated Irish three-year-old of either sex. In the following year she was rated 126 by Timeform and was officially rated the third-best older female horse in Europe behind Gold River and Detroit. Breeding record Cairn Rouge produced at least nine foals between 1983 and 1998, five of whom won races: *Tikanova (bay filly, foaled 1983, sired by Northern Dancer), unraced.

Early years Facade of the Church of San Clemente Little is known of Cominelli's youth. He was probably born in Venice in the first half of the 17th century into a family from Bergamo. In 1652 Francesco and Tommaso Morosini commissioned Cominelli to restore the facade of the Church of San Clemente on the Isola di San Clemente. He included busts of Morosini family members above the portal, and their coat of arms. He also added statues of Saint Benedict and Saint Romuald, and a Madonna and cherub. The facade includes reliefs of scenes from battles commemorating the Morosini's victories in the war against the Turks. He is thought to have himself made the sculptures of the two brothers Morosini and of the two saints. Carmelite convent Cominelli is recorded on a bill of payment dated 4 April 1653 for implementation of an altar in the church of the new Venetian convent of the Carmelites of St. Theresa. He was engaged in this work until the end of 1654. He supervised construction of the convent and church of San Palo between 1682 and 1683, said by Brandolese in 1795 to have \\"some elegance, that would be greater if it were not encrusted with stucco\\". In 1679 he was in charge of the arrangement of the organ, with the work done by Eugenio Gasparini. On 7 April 1682 he signed an agreement for the partial reconstruction and beautification of the altar of the Blessed Virgin of Carmel. The church and convent of St. Teresa were built by Cominelli for the Sisters of Saint Theresa and consecrated in 1688. The church has a tall, square and simple design. Other work The Palazzo Labia in Venice on the Cannaregio canal While working almost continuously for the Carmelites, Cominelli undertook other works. He made the altar of Baldassarre Longhena's St. Mary the Virgin in 1674-1677. He participated in the competition for design of the \\"Dogana da Mar\\" customs house (1676-1677). There are no records of activity after 1688. However, he was credited with the design of the Palazzo Labia, built for private clients. Cominelli designed the water facades of the building. The building was completed in 1696. Later the ballroom was decorated by the perspective artist Gerolamo Mengozzi Colonna and the fresco painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The paintings tell the story of Anthony and Cleopatra. In the mid-18th century Alessandro Tremignon designed the campo facade of the palace.

Home of Polish Crown Jewels and National Art Collection Between 1939 and 1941 objects of fine and decorative art deemed to be of exceptional artistic or historical value, which became known collectively as Polish National Treasures (, ), were evacuated out of Poland at the onset of World War II in September 1939 and transported via Romania, France, and Britain to Canada. The bulk of them came from the Wawel Castle in Kraków and included a rich collection of Jagiellonian tapestries, as well as Szczerbiec, the medieval coronation sword of Polish kings; these came to be known as Wawel Treasures (), an appellation sometimes erroneously extended to all of the evacuated items. Most of the rest of the salvaged objects were manuscripts from the National Library in Warsaw, including the earliest documents in the Polish language and Frédéric Chopin's autograph sheet music. The treasures were complemented by works of art from the Royal Castle of Warsaw and a Gutenberg Bible from the library of the Catholic Higher Seminary of Pelplin. After the end of the war, the treasures remained in Canada for nearly two decades due to competing claims made by the new communist government of Poland and the London-based Polish government-in-exile. Negotiations spanned over fifteen years before they were eventually returned to Poland in 1961. The treasures Szczerbiec, the Coronation Sword. This collection consists of hundreds of pieces, some of which are globally notable. =The Coronation Sword= Szczerbiec, commonly referred to as Poland’s Coronation Sword, is a two-handed antique battle weapon that had been used to crown Polish kings for generations. Its popularity is derived, in part, from a myth attached to the blade in which legend dictated that any king that did not use this sword at coronation would endanger the borders of his country, putting his kingdom at risk of invasion. It possesses a bejewelled hilt, encapsulating a number of Polish engravings. It is the only preserved piece of the Polish Crown Jewels still in existence today. =The Gutenberg Bible= A Gutenberg Bible from the Diocesan Museum in Pelplin Created by Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor credited with bringing the practice of printing to Europe, this Bible represents one of the first major works printed with movable type in 1455. It is beloved, among many reasons, because it is considered to be a piece of exceptional quality largely due to Gutenberg’s choice of ink, binding, and printing materials in its construction. Approximately 180 copies were originally produced, with each surviving copy now worth upwards of $100 million. =Jagiellonian Tapestries= Noah's Conversation with God, a Flemish tapestry from King Sigismund Augustus's collection Originally commissioned by King Sigismund II Augustus, these tapestries came into existence to commemorate the commencement of his third marriage.They can be described as fairly large pieces of silk, often stretching across meters of space, with lengths of gold and silver thread woven into the fabric. Every piece is unique in that they depict different settings or scenes in history, often possessing religious connotations (like Noah’s Ark). The collection consisted of over 300 original pieces. However, over half of them were pawned by a later king at a time when Poland was in great financial debt. Afterwards, only 137 pieces remained. As a whole, though, they compose the largest collection of tapestries ever commissioned by a single ruler. They are widely considered to be masterpieces of art and Europe’s greatest tapestry collection. Journey abroad Concern grew for the safety of the treasures at the Castle when Poland faced the imminent invasion of Nazi soldiers in 1939. Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich was moving eastward across Europe, and had already issues multiple threats to the nation. The Polish government was determined to protect their most ancient and valuable historical pieces from the Nazi party, so they made the decision to move them across Europe until they had found the treasures a safe place to hide. They began constructing large cases and cylinders for the relics, closing off the Castle from public access in order to prepare them for transport in secret. =Across Europe= The treasures took longer to prepare than expected, leaving the Castle two days after Germany had already invaded Poland. Fortunately, Hans Frank (the Nazi Governor-General in charge of Poland’s takeover) and his men did not storm the Castle and seize it for themselves until after the treasures had already departed. They were secretly loaded onto barges, wagons, buses, and trucks. To ensure their safe transport they were accompanied by Stanislaw Zaleski and Jozef Polkowski, two curators from Wawel Castle familiar with the treasures. The treasures and the curators travelled to the border of Poland, where they mixed with a group of refugees fleeing the country and heading for Romania. From there, they made their way to the embassy in Bucharest to seek temporary shelter. At this point, Zaleski and Polkowski had no idea where they were going to hide the treasures. They explored various options at this time, attempting to secure storage in Switzerland or Vatican City. However, both endeavors proved to be fruitless. They again moved locations, this time to Malta where they resided for approximately two weeks while they continued to strategize. There, they learned of France’s efforts to hide the French State Collection in various factories while the Nazis roamed Eastern Europe. Upon hearing this, they travelled to Aubusson where they hid the Wawel Treasures in a vacant factory, as well. However, this hiding place only lasted for six months until the Nazis breached Western Europe, forcing Zaleski and Polkowski to move once again. The MS Batory At this point, the curators believed that the only way to keep the treasures from being seized by the Nazis was to send them across the Atlantic Ocean. They journeyed to the Polish embassy in London, with the intention of arranging for the pieces to be transported to Canada. The collection was secretly placed aboard the MS Batory, which was destined for North America. In order to further ensure the treasures’ safety, the ship joined a larger fleet travelling under the name Operation Fish, in which an unprecedented amount of European valuables were secretly being transported by boat to Canada for safekeeping. They embarked on their journey on July 4, 1940. =In Canada= The Batory docked in Halifax, Nova Scotia on July 12, 1940. The treasures were allowed to enter Canada duty-free since they were considered to be private property of the Polish government. They were then transferred via train to Ottawa, Ontario with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police serving as their escorts. After being temporarily stored at the Polish consulate, the treasures were moved to a storage building at the Experimental Farm after Zaleski and Polkowski were informed of its fireproof and temperature-controlled environment. The search =After the war= In 1945, the Soviet Union had taken over and established a new regime in Poland, much to the dismay of the Polish natives who had been chased out of their home country by the Nazis. This did not sit well with Polkowski, who argued with Zaleski that returning the treasures to Poland after the war as planned would place them in the hands of the Soviets. The original Polish government, in exile in London, sent Wacław Babiński to Ottawa. There, he plotted with the curators to move the Wawel collection from their current location in order to keep them from the new Polish government when their representatives eventually came looking for them. Thus, the men began to redistribute the works across Central Canada. They packed the antiquities into large trunks and quietly removed them from the storage building at the Experimental Farm. They sent two trunks nearby to the Bank of Montreal in Ottawa to be secretly stored in one of their vaults. Among its contents were the Coronation Sword and the Gutenberg Bible, two of the collection’s most valuable pieces. Eight trunks of Polish military pieces were also shipped to a nearby location, having been moved to the Convent of the Precious Blood in Ottawa. The remaining twenty-four trunks were sent to a monastery in Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupre near Quebec City. However, they left a small portion of the collection behind at the Experimental Farm in the hopes of fooling the Soviets into believing that the entire collection still remained there. =Canadian involvement= Dr. Fiderkiewicz, a representative from the new Polish regime, arrived in Canada in 1946 to make a formal request for the return of the Wawel treasures. It did not take him long to discover the near-vacant state of the storage building at the Experimental Farm. He placed a call to Canada’s Department of External Affairs, which alerted the government to the disappearance of the treasures nearly a year after they had been moved. Fiderkiwicz quickly surmised that the Canadian government had no idea that the Polish works had been moved, let alone where they were hiding now. Canadian officials feigned ignorance, asserting that the curators who accompanied the collection to Canada possessed full legal responsibility over it. Still, they offered to retrace the steps of the treasures in the hopes of maintaining good international relations. They were eventually successful in this endeavor, locating each place in which the curators had sent the Polish pieces. However, verifying this information proved difficult since most of these locations were places of religious worship, which the government had no legal right to search without cause. To make matters more difficult, each location admitted to their culpability in storing the treasures but vehemently insisted that they had already been removed from their care; they lied. Polkowski had instructed them to do so in the hopes of determining the loyalty of his partner, Zaleski. Once word got back to Fiderkiewicz that they treasures had to still be at the disclosed locations, Polkowski knew that Zaleski had switched allegiances and so he secretly arranged to have the entire collection moved again. =Legal issues= Polkowski’s efforts proved almost to be almost successful. Unfortunately for him, Fiderkiewicz called a press conference to divulge to the world that he had discovered the two trunks stored in the vaults at the Bank of Montreal in Ottawa and was negotiating for their safe return. This drew international attention to the matter, since the world had been unaware of the harrowing journey the Wawel treasures had been on. Canada, which at this point had remained silent on the matter, was forced to make a statement due to the global scrutiny they were now receiving. William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Prime Minister at the time, asserted that since the treasures entered Canada as private property of the Polish government, they had no right to get involved in the management of their possessions. In what he described as a show of good faith, he offered the Polish government a deal – the RCMP would be enlisted to track down and retrieve the entire collection on the condition that they could be put in display in Canada for a period of five years before being sent back to Poland. Perceiving this as act of disrespect, Poland profusely refused this offer. Mackenzie King went on to suggest that, since Canada had no legal parameters to extradite the curators or export the treasures, the Polish government could seek legal action as a private individual in the Canadian court system against those they believed were responsible for wrongfully moving Polish property from their designated location (i.e. Zaleski and Polkowski). Again, Poland refused this suggestion. =Stalemate= Maurice Duplessis Despite Poland’s anger towards Canada over the matter, the RCMP was still enlisted to search Central Canada for the remainder of the missing relics. Some officers eventually discovered that the majority of the trunks had been hidden at L’Hôtel-Dieu Hospital in Quebec City. Before the Canadian government could negotiate with the appropriate parties to come to a peaceful resolution, the Polish government intervened and issued a flurry of threats to the hospital demanding their cooperation. A group of nuns residing at L’Hôtel-Dieu sent a letter to Maurice Duplessis, the Premier of Quebec, asking for his immediate assistance in the matter. As a result, he moved the entire collection to the Provincial Museum before the RCMP could act. Duplessis refused to return the collection to Poland, citing that the communist government now in office had no right to them. He believed the true owners of the treasures were still in exile, residing in London as a separate faction. He acknowledged that the Canadian government had no legal right to remove the Wawel pieces from his province’s museum. Furthermore, if the RCMP stormed the Provincial Museum illegally and forcibly removed the works from his possession, the Canadian government would appear to be supporting a communist government, which would harm their international relationships with other sovereign nations. Duplessis had both nations exactly where he wanted them – unable to act – for the next five years. Journey home The death of Joseph Stalin, the premier of the Soviet Union, in 1953 triggered a series of events that started to move things along. The newly elected government in Poland appeared to be independent of the Soviet Union’s influence, and so the Bank of Montreal completed negotiations with Polish officials to release the two trunks in their possession to Poland’s custody. A group of delegates arrived to accompany the pieces back home. They travelled from Montreal to Toronto through Ottawa and then to New York to avoid Duplessis’ government. Eventually, they made their way across the ocean to Poland where they were quickly put back on display at Wawel Castle. Among these pieces were the Coronation Sword and Gutenberg Bible, two of Poland’s most valuable treasures. The death of Duplessis in 1959 was the last piece of the puzzle Poland needed to retrieve their cultural property. The new party that took over Quebec’s government wanted to repair its image in the international community, so in 1960 it agreed to return all of the treasures to Poland. The only stipulation was that neither the Provincial Museum nor the provincial government could be held legally accountable for what had transpired over the last decade. Upon Poland’s agreement to these terms, the remaining trunks were loaded into trucks and driven to Boston. There, they boarded a ship bound for Gdynia, Poland. A large winter storm slightly delayed their voyage, but eventually the relics reached their homeland. They boarded a train to Warsaw for inspection, and then were promptly shipped to Kraków to be put back on display at Wawel Castle. Aftermath After two decades abroad, the Wawel Treasures had finally returned to their original location. While their journey was tumultuous, the ordeal appears to have strengthened the political bond between Canada and Poland. Polish officials bestowed a reproduction of the Gutenberg Bible to the Canadian government to show their government’s appreciation for Canada’s efforts in retrieving the treasures. Their recovery contributed to the restoration of Wawel Castle as one of Poland’s national museums. They are now on display as a major component of the Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection.

Jordal Stadion was built between 1930 and 1936. It is currently used for recreational football and American football, although it has previously also been used for speed skating. Jordal Amfi was built for ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics and opened in 1951. The Vålerenga Trolls play American football at the stadium and Vålerenga Ishockey play in the amphitheater. The track around the football stadium was formerly used for track and field. It was especially prominent in the Workers' Confederation of Sports (AIF), where it was used for national championships for AIF clubs, like Jordal IF. It also hosted the national Workers' Championships in race walking, 5000 metres, in 1937 and 1938. Since 1926, the road race walking events had also been staged from Jordal. After the Workers' Confederation of Sports became defunct, Jordal was also used as a national venue by the Norwegian Walking Association. The local multi-sports club was named Jordal IF.

It was eventually replaced in 1894 by Aberdare Urban District Council. The challenges facing a rapidly developing urban community were a concern to the relatively small middle class of Aberdare as well as the more communbity-spirited of the industrialists. One of the leading figures in persuading the community to adopt the Health of Town Acts was the nonconformist minister, Thomas Price. The first board, elected in 1854, included David Davis, Blaengwawr, Crawshay Bailey, Thomas Price and Richard Fothergill who became its first chairman. 'We hope', reflected a local newspaper, 'after so much delay, that active measures will now be taken immediately, as a very wide field for exertion is open to the board'. Cholera was the main concern and although, at that stage, there had been no cases at Aberdare, there had been an outbreak at nearby Hirwaun. The main challenge in the early years was dealing with cholera outbreaks and the rapidly developing industrial community. At the end of its first year, four members of the Board were to retire and seek re-election and it was proposed by Thomas Price, and agreed by the other members, that they would seek to secure their return. Fothergill was re-elected chairman in August 1855. In 1866, Thomas Price, after an absence of some years, resumed his membership of the Board, heading the poll ahead of David Davis. William Thomas Lewis, later Lord Merthyr, was also elected to the Board for the first time. Board of Health Elections =1854 Election= Elected: David Davies; Thomas Joseph; Rev.

It is named for their son Fred Baldwin (1881-1905). Its architect was H. L. Kerr, who had earlier designed the Old Wailuku Courthouse. In 2011, it was restored by Xorin Balbes to operate as an educational retreat named Lumeria Maui. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 1 December 2011. History Fred Chambers Baldwin, one of eight children of Emily and Henry P. Baldwin, had graduated from Yale University in 1903, then returned to Maui and to manage Ha‘ikū and Grove ranches. He died at age 24 while visiting relatives in New York, after falling ill and undergoing surgery for appendicitis. Fred was \\"handsome and charismatic,\\" the most popular of his siblings, and had aspired to manage Haleakala Ranch. Many people lined the roads as his coffin was carried from Kahului Harbor up to the family home at Olinda. Many of the early residents were veterans of World War I and are buried in nearby Makawao Cemetery. During World War II, they were moved to the Pioneer Inn in Lahaina and the facility was converted to a military hospital until war's end. For most of its existence, from 1911 to 1958, the home was run by Ethel Baldwin, the wife of Fred's brother Henry Alexander Baldwin, and their daughter Frances, who married J. Walter Cameron of Maui Pineapple Company. After 1958, the buildings provided dormitory space for Maunaolu Seminary. Then Maui Land & Pineapple Company bought the property and housed summer workers there from 1982 until the 1990s. After that, the buildings remained unused until 2009, when they were purchased by SoulSpace Ranch, who undertook the renovation. Architecture In 1910-1911, Kahului Railroad Company construction crews built the original five buildings in a U-shaped plan around a central lawn and landscape garden. The wooden buildings reflect a primarily American Craftsman style, but with some Neo-classical and vernacular Japanese details. Although the buildings had fallen into disuse, the 2010-2011 renovation was able to preserve much of the original structure and detail.

Taracena was born in Mexico City in 1925, to a family which was interested in culture. Her father was a Mexican senator and friend of Carlos Chávez, the director of the Palacio de Bellas Artes. This allowed her to earn a quality education, receiving a bachelor's and master's degree in Mexican history from the Universidad Nacional de México. Her master's thesis was done on the work of Jesús Reyes Ferreira, whom she knew personally. She also studied and worked under academics such as Francisco de la Maza and Justino Fernández. She began her writing career young, publishing about two articles a week, generally reviewing current trends in art, along with art news. She also began doing research work, writing and editing books, along with museum curating. She has worked with other notables in Mexico’s art world such as Fernando Gamboa. Her specialty is Mexican visual art, having written hundreds of essays, articles and books as well as appearing at conferences. She focuses on the continuity of Mexican art from its pre-Hispanic roots to the present. She has published notable books on artists such as Diego Rivera, Manuel Rodríguez Lozano, Vladimir Cora, Leopoldo Flores and Antonio Ramírez, as well as Estética del arte mexicano en el tiempo in 2006. She has stated that Mexican art “constitutes a singular and unique phenomenon, owing to a mixture of traces and elements that bring together an idea of an original cohesion, created by the qualities of monument, and rich imagination. Form, line, color, fantasy and meaning are woven to define an idea of art with particular traits.” In 2009, the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México held a tribute to her life's work.

The long-lived storm began developing in the last hours of 1995, and slowly consolidated over the open waters of the South-West Indian Ocean. Tracking generally toward the west-southwest, the disturbance received its name from Météo-France on January 5. Ultimately peaking as an intense tropical cyclone, Bonita bypassed Mauritius and Réunion to the north before striking northeastern Madagascar late on January 10. There, the storm affected up to 150,000 people, flooded wide tracts of croplands, and killed 25 people. In the aftermath, disaster relief came from both the government of Madagascar and the international community, as well as non-governmental organizations (NGOs); the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs assisted in the distribution of about $450,000 in monetary donations. Bonita emerged into the Mozambique Channel as a significantly diminished storm, though it quickly regained some of its previous intensity. Three days after its initial landfall, the cyclone moved ashore over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique. Throughout northern parts of the country, Bonita triggered extensive flooding that damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings and reportedly killed 17 individuals. Swollen rivers submerged roads and bridges, isolating some locations. A meteorological rarity, Bonita continued inland for several days, persisting as a distinct tropical low; the system traversed southern Africa and ultimately entered the South Atlantic Ocean. In the process, it dropped unseasonably heavy rainfall over Zimbabwe and Zamibia. A paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department asserted that Bonita was the first storm confirmed to have tracked across the African continent from the South-West Indian Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean. Meteorological history Cyclone Bonita originated from a weak area of disturbed weather observed about to the east of Diego Garcia, in the Chagos Archipelago, on December 31, 1995. The system was marked by a distinct low-level circulation and curved banding features,Le Goff, et al., p. 24 and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) promptly began monitoring it. A hostile upper-air pattern prevented further organization over the following several days as the disturbance drifted generally toward the southwest. On January 3, the low pressure center showed initial signs of strengthening, prompting Météo-France to declare it a tropical disturbance, the lowest of seven distinct intensity categories used by the agency. The surrounding environment became more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with increased upper-level divergence, and consequently, the system further matured; it was upgraded to a depression early on January 5, and to a moderate tropical storm 12 hours later. At that time, it was named Bonita.Le Goff, et al., p. 25 The JTWC upgraded 06S (its internal designation for Bonita) to a tropical storm equivalent early the next day. Continuing to intensify, the storm accelerated toward the west-southwest, heading nearly due west for a short time as it encountered a subtropical ridge of high pressure. The cyclone's inner structure steadily improved in organization, adhering well to the model of a well-developed tropical system. Transcending the severe tropical cyclone stage, Bonita achieved tropical cyclone status at 1200 UTC on January 8. Passing just south of St. Brandon, the system exhibited a broad and ill- defined eye about 50 km (30 mi) across. The cyclone quickly strengthened over the course of January 8, with a consolidating eye and a formidable central dense overcast. Tracking about north of Mauritius, Bonita reached its peak intensity--as assessed by Météo-France--with maximum sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a central barometric air pressure of . This ranked the storm as an intense tropical cyclone, the second-highest category on the regional scale. The JTWC lists 06S as having peaked at 1200 UTC the next day, with 1-minute peak winds of 250 km/h (155 mph) (coinciding with strong Category 4 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale). According to Météo-France, Bonita began to weaken slightly by early on January 9, the eye becoming asymmetric and poorly defined. The ridge to the south prevented the storm from progressing to the south, and after passing about 270 km (170 mi) north of Réunion, Bonita shifted due west and later roughly west-by-north, apparently steered by a building mid-to-upper-level anticyclone south of Madagascar.Le Goff, et al., pp. 25–26 It remained a strong tropical cyclone as it approached the eastern coast of Madagascar, making landfall near Mahavelona on the night of January 10 local time, or about 2130 UTC. At the time of landfall, a clear eye was visible on satellite imagery.Le Goff, et al., p. 28 It crossed the island nation over the course of about a day, weakening significantly to a moderate tropical storm as it reemerged into the Mozambique Channel. Once over water, favorable conditions prompted quick reintensification of the cyclone, as it proceeded west-southwestward toward mainland Africa.Le Goff, et al., p. 26 At 1200 UTC on January 13, Bonita reattained severe tropical storm status, marking its secondary peak intensity with 10-minute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). With an expansive circulation and a good structure, the cyclone made its second and final landfall over the Zambezia Province of Mozambique, between Quelimane and Pebane District, on the night of January 13 local time. Bonita meandered inland, weakening only gradually and nearly tracking back over open water. The remnants of Bonita at midday on 19 January 1996, off the coast of Angola Although the cyclone's \\"best track\\" listings by both Météo-France and the JTWC end at 0600 UTC on January 15, its residual tropical low remained distinct and active as it continued generally westward across the southern African continent. Where nearly all landfalling tropical cyclones in the area recurve toward the south or dissipate quickly on moving ashore, a rare synoptic pattern allowed the remnants of Bonita to persist, moving over northern Zimbabwe on January 16. For the next two days, the weakening storm remained prominent on satellite imagery, ultimately moving off the coast of Angola and entering the South Atlantic Ocean on January 19. By the next day, the system had succumbed to cold waters and days of land interaction, dissipating completely. According to a paper published by the Zambia Meteorological Department, Bonita was the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South- West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic. Impact and aftermath =Madagascar= A recording station at Toamasina recorded of rain in 24 hours, accompanied by sustained winds of 150 km/h (95 mph). Stronger winds were observed on the offshore island of Île Sainte-Marie, where gusts exceeded on January 10.Le Goff, et al., p. 27 Extensive freshwater flooding penetrated far inland, inundating of rice crops in one area alone near Antananarivo. Damage was heaviest along the northeastern coastline of Madagascar, particularly around Mahavelona, Fenoarivo Atsinanana, and Mahambo. where both infrastructure and crops took a heavy beating. In its seasonal tropical cyclone report, Météo-France confirmed that 25 people in the country were either killed, or unaccounted for and presumed dead. Overall, the storm impacted as many as 150,000 individuals, of whom 5,000 were left homeless. However, coverage of the disaster was scarce. Following the storm, a government-endorsed disaster relief program was initiated to mitigate the developing humanitarian crisis in the three hardest-hit communes. The program was to distribute emergency food rations to 40,000 affected individuals, with special supplies intended to reach 1,500 malnourished children. A malnutrition rehabilitation center was established in Mahavelona as part of the program, which cost approximately $1.2 million (1996 USD) in total, and funded partially by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA). At the end of February, the Government of Madagascar requested international aid; by March 6, France and Germany had donated a combined $100,000 in assistance funds, as well as emergency supplies worth nearly $80,000. Overall, the DHA handled roughly $450,000 in foreign donations, mostly from Europe. United States Ambassador to Madagascar, Vicki J. Huddleston, authorized the allocation of $25,000 to distribute tarps, while the United States Agency for International Development sent $17,000 for medical treatment. Immediately following the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that the storm was either too early in the season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies. =Africa= Bonita also proved destructive in northern Mozambique, notably in the provinces of Zambezia, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado. The storm extensively damaged about 400 houses in the city of Quelimane, which was left with severely impaired electric facilities. Subsequently, international entities distributed emergency food supplies to storm victims. Substantial rainfall caused damaging floods throughout inland portions of country, reportedly killing as many as 17 people. Floodwaters destroyed of crops and demolished many buildings, including about 12 schools. The Buzi River swelled beyond its banks, sweeping away nearby houses and rendering roadways impassable in the Buzi District. Local officials were unable to reach the hardest-hit places, prompting fears of heavier destruction than what had been reported. Significant flooding was also reported in the Pungwe River watershed; bridges over two of its tributaries were submerged. The remnants of Bonita dropped significant precipitation, described as the heaviest in 80 years, over drought-stricken eastern Zimbabwe. A long-standing two-day rainfall total was broken at Rusape, which recorded of precipitation between January 15 and 16. Unsettled weather extended into Zambia, which endured relatively strong winds and noteworthy precipitation that contributed to above-normal seasonal rainfall totals in many areas; by comparison, rainfall remained average or even trended slightly below-average across northern and eastern sections of the nation. Daily rainfall totals in Zambia peaked at at Choma on January 16.

She was bombed twice and torpedoed twice as a World War II troopship before being abandoned at Manila in 1944. History Noshiro Maru was completed at Nagasaki in 1934 by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding for the (NYK) Line. Its maiden voyage was to New York City in 1935. Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July, the IJA requisitioned Noshiro Maru as transport No. 226 on 8 August 1937 for moving Japanese infantry to Wusong. Noshiro Maru was part of convoys landing the 18th Infantry Regiment on 2 September and the 36th Infantry Regiment on 26 September. Noshiro Maru resumed commercial service for the NYK line on 7 January 1939, but was requisitioned by the IJN on 1 May 1941 for conversion to a seaplane tender. Priorities were revised, and Noshiro Maru emerged from the conversion process on 14 October 1941 as an armed merchant cruiser.

His life is unremarkable save for the court case centered on him at the tail-end of the 17th century. His wife was on trial for his murder, though he reappeared during the case, with multiple people confirming his identity. It was an early example of the cause célèbres that would dominate the end of the 18th century, and it raised new questions about nobility and social status in Old Regime France. Early life Berry relative to the rest of France. Pivardière was born in the Berry on November 15, 1661, to Antoine de la Pivardière and his second wife, Marie de Berthoulat.Ravel, p. 1 He was not in a position to take advantage of his inherited nobility, and the first two decades of his life are marked by attempts to make a name for himself in the military. The reigning Louis XIV's territorial ambitions gave him many chances to do so. He served in the Franco- Dutch War and, several years later, fought in the Battle of Chiny. Regardless, he was unable to advance in the military. In 1687, he married Marguerite Chauvelin and became seigneur de Narbonne, the Chauvelin family estate.Ravel, p. 17 He and his wife had a daughter in 1688, but soon after the Nine Years War began and Pivardière again served in the military. The war went catastrophically for France and Pivardière yet again could not advance in the military, despite years of trying. By 1697, his ambition had nearly emptied his coffers.Ravel, p. 29 Alleged murder and initial investigations On August 15, 1697, Pivardière unexpectedly returned to Narbonne.Ravel, p. 30-31 Amidst rumors of his possible infidelity in Auxerre, he returned from his military duties with no escort and a lame horse. He and Chauvelin had a falling out and slept in separate rooms. By the next morning, Pivardière had disappeared and the front gate to the estate was open. During the ensuing weeks, when Pivardière did not reappear, rumors began to spread that Chauvelin had murdered her husband, and François Morin and Jean Bonnet, judges from Châtillon, launched a criminal investigation.Ravel, p. 35-36 The investigation resulted in little hard evidence against Chauvelin, likely because of the nearly two-month delay in an actual crime scene investigation. Most notably, they had not discovered a body. All Morin and Bonnet had to show for their efforts were several transcripts and two maidservants, Catherine Lemoyne and Marguerite Mercier, in their custody as witnesses. Chauvelin and the prior Charost, an alleged conspirator in the murder, had disappeared as well. The following months resulted in Lemoyne and Mercier's testimony of the events of August 15 changing wildly, perhaps due to influence from Morin and Bonnet.Ravel, p. 60 In January 1698, Pivardière allegedly reappeared, exonerating Chauvelin and Charost. Multiple witnesses confirmed his identity, but the momentum stalled when Lemoyne and Mercier asserted that the man was not Pivardière. The momentum took another drastic shift when the main claiming to be Pivardière disappeared again, and even more in February with the arrest and imprisonment of the prior Charost. In May, Chauvelin voluntarily imprisoned herself in a Parisian prison. Due to this as well as the swelling tide of publicity surrounding the case, the court venue shifted to the Parlement of Paris.Ravel, p. 63 Trial at the Parlement of Paris King Louis XIV, depicted in 1701. The first hearing in Paris of the Pivardière case was on May 10, 1698.Ravel, p. 71 The biggest question the defense had to answer was this: If Pivardière was still alive, why would he not come to Paris to exonerate his wife and the prior? Chauvelin and Charost's attorneys argued that it was because Pivardière feared an arrest for bigamy, a crime that was punishable by death in Old Regime France. They asserted that in 1695, Pivardière had taken the name Louis Dubouchet, moved to Auxerre, and married Marie-Elisabeth Pillard, the daughter of a deceased innkeeper. They further asserted that Pivardière had kept up fake correspondence with his first wife that gave the impression that he was still in the military. Upon his return to Narbonne on August 15, 1697, he discovered that Chauvelin suspected his infidelity and deemed it unwise to remain there.Ravel, p. 74-80 Logically, according to Chauvelin and Charost's attorneys, Pivardière did not want to travel to Paris without being granted a safe conduct that would protect him from being arrested on bigamy charges. The safe conduct was not granted, however, and the man claiming to be Pivardière did not show up in court. On July 23, the Parlement of Paris rendered its verdict, which ordered a transferral of the witnesses, suspects (save for Chauvelin), and evidence to Chartres, where a new investigation would begin. The court also ordered the arrest of the man claiming to be Pivardière.Ravel, p. 91-92 In August, King Louis XIV granted the safe conduct, and Pivardière traveled to Paris. In September, he voluntarily imprisoned himself and issued an appeal of the July ruling that he was an imposter. By December, the king had upheld the appeal and ordered a retrial. The court, now able to interrogate the man claiming to be Pivardière, put the case to rest in July 1699. Pivardière's identity was confirmed, which exonerated Chauvelin and Charost. The fates of the maidservants were less ideal—Lemoyne died in prison and Mercier was found guilty of giving false testimony. Her punishment was to be publicly humiliated, branded with the fleur-de-lis, and banished from the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Paris.Ravel, p. 207 Significance No record of Pivardière exists after the court confirmed his identity. It is unknown where and when he died. The court case surrounding his supposed murder, however, gained considerable public attention and, at the turn of the 18th century, raised questions about judicial corruption and nobility. It also served as one of Henri François d'Aguesseau's most notable court cases as the king's Attorney General. Pivardière willingly gave up his noble title and identity to marry an undistinguished young woman in Auxerre. Nobility was typically seen as desirable, but Pivardière's experiences highlighted a less glamorous side of nobility. His military ambitions fell flat, his holdings were inconsequential, and he held little to no influence in the workings of the world around him..Though the scandal surrounding his supposed murder was bizarre, the reason for his disappearance was almost even more bizarre. The harsh verdict against the maidservant Mercier also highlighted the awkward workings of the judicial system in late 17th-century France. She was found guilty of giving false testimony, but it was likely that Morin and Bonnet coerced her into giving them testimony that would work in their favor. With Lemoyne dead, Mercier took the fall for the failures of the court system. Legacy The sensational story of Louis de la Pivardière seemed like it was written for the stage. In fact, it was: French dramatist Florent Carton Dancourt adapted Pivardière's story for the stage in Le Mari retrouvé (The Husband Returned), which was staged in Paris in late 1698 to massive audiences.Ravel, p. 124-125 More recently, in 1972 a French made-for-TV dramatization of the case entitled L'Etrange trépas de Monsieur de la Pivardière (The Strange Death of Monsieur de la Pivardière) aired on the French National Broadcasting system. In 1990 director Antonín Moskalyk (Czechoslovakia) made an episode Písmo of the TV serial named Dobrodružství kriminalistiky inspired by the case. References * Ravel, Jeffrey S.

The original two-story building was constructed in 1902 by Nels Roney as a dry goods store owned by former Eugene mayor J. H. McClung. The building was expanded to four stories in 1913. History John H. McClung arrived in Oregon and began farming in 1856. With his uncle, he established the first drug store in Eugene in 1859. In 1902 he built the two-story McClung Building at Eighth and Willamette, operating a dry goods store under the name, Cockerline and Fraley. The building featured elements of what came to be known as Chicago commercial style, with large display windows and reduced ornamentation. George H. McMorran and Carl G. Washburne became business partners, opening a dry goods store in 1909. The two had worked as store clerks for Samuel H. Friendly in Eugene. In 1913 McMorran and Washburne purchased and renovated the McClung building, adding two floors. McMorran and Washburne became Eugene's premiere dry goods store, and in 1927 the store outgrew its location and was moved to a new building at the corner of Broadway and Willamette.McMorran and Washburne occupied the new building until 1939, when J.C.

Anti-government protests took place between November 2013 and May 2014, organised by the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), a political pressure group led by former Democrat Party parliamentary representative (MP) Suthep Thaugsuban. The crisis eventually resulted in the removal of incumbent Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, a coup d'état, and the establishment of a military junta. The primary aim of the protests was removing the influence of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the brother of Yingluck, on Thai politics and the creation of an unelected \\"people's council\\" to oversee reforms of the political system. Protesters viewed Thaksin as corrupt and damaging to Thailand's democracy, although he enjoyed strong support in many areas of Thailand, particularly the poorer north and northeast, due to his reforming social programs and economic policies. Political parties allied to Thaksin had won a majority in every election since 2001. Other issues, such as the royal succession, a rural-urban or north-south divide, social inequality, over- centralised bureaucracy, royal and military influence in politics and class conflict were suggested as factors behind the crisis by analysts and commentators. Protests were first triggered by a proposed amnesty bill which would have pardoned politicians from various charges from the period following the 2006 coup d'état. Anti-government protestors argued the bill, and a simultaneous government attempt to alter the 2007 constitution, favoured Thaksin and would potentially allow him to return from self-imposed exile due to a corruption conviction. The pro-government Red Shirt movement also opposed the amnesty due to its inclusion of murder charges related to the 2010 military crackdown on pro-Thaksin protests, in which 91 were killed. Opposition from across the political spectrum caused the bill to be rejected unanimously by the Senate of Thailand. Anti-government protests continued however, with demonstrators occupying government offices, blocking major road intersections and holding mass rallies in Bangkok to call for the resignation of Yingluck and her Pheu Thai government. On 8 December 2013, all 153 opposition Democrat Party MPs resigned and Yingluck dissolved the House of Representatives, calling a snap general election for 2 February. Voting was disrupted in areas of Bangkok and southern Thailand by PDRC protesters blocking entry to polling stations, leading to an annulment of the result by the Constitutional Court. Sporadic violence, including shootings, bomb attempts and grenades thrown at protesters led to 28 deaths and over 800 injuries during the course of the protests. On 21 January, Yingluck's government declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding areas, to little effect. Yingluck and nine ministers were removed from office by the Constitutional Court on 7 May 2014 over the controversial transfer of a senior security officer in 2011. Supporters of Yingluck and critics argued that the move was politically motivated and an abuse of judicial power. On 20 May, the Royal Thai Army declared martial law throughout the nation, followed two days later by a coup which removed the government and named General Prayut Chan-o- cha as acting prime minister. Background The government of Yingluck came to power in the 2011 elections, in which her Pheu Thai Party won an outright majority. Yingluck is a sister of former prime minister Thaksin, and the Pheu Thai Party was closely aligned with him. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup d'état, was living in self-imposed exile to avoid a 2008 corruption conviction and still commanded popular support across much of the country, especially among rural Thais and the urban poor. The Shinawatra family was especially revered in the rural northeast due to the economic and social gains from Thaksinomics: between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area soared from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000. Several amnesty proposals and amendments to the constitution had been debated by the House of Representatives during Yingluck's premiership. Most of these were popularly perceived as benefiting Thaksin, and were opposed by the Democrat Party. In August 2013, the Pheu Thai-majority House approved a first reading of a draft amnesty bill. Street protests leading up to the parliamentary session were held by an anti-Thaksin group calling itself the \\"People's Democratic Force to Overthrow Thaksinism\\" (PEFOT), as well as by the Democrat Party, but these failed to gain momentum. The amnesty bill was handed over to a 35-member scrutinising committee, after which it would be returned to the House for second and third readings. The committee passed a revised draft of the bill on 18 October 2013. The bill, which in its original form was aimed to absolve civilian protesters, excluding protest and government leaders and the military, was drastically expanded into a \\"blanket amnesty\\", covering the period from 2004 to 2013. This would have included the corruption charges laid against Thaksin following the 2006 coup, as well as the murder charges against then Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva and Deputy PM Suthep Thaugsuban related to their conduct during the 2010 mass protests in support of Thaksin. Timeline of the events =Protests against amnesty bill= Protesters near the Democracy Monument in Bangkok, November 2013 The bill was passed by the Pheu Thai Party–dominated House of Representatives on 1 November 2013 at around 04:00. The final draft of the bill would have pardoned protesters involved in various incidents of political unrest since 2004, dismissed Thaksin's corruption convictions, and annulled murder charges against Abhisit and Suthep. The bill sparked opposition from both the Democrat Party and the pro-government Red Shirt movement. Criticism was levelled at the government for passing the vote in the unusual pre-dawn session to prevent opposition. Thaksin's opponents protested against absolving Thaksin of his convictions. Thaksin supporters criticised the bill for absolving those responsible for the crackdown on the 2010 protests. On 4 November 2013, several protests took place in Bangkok, as well as in several provincial cities. Several universities and organisations issued statements condemning the bill. However, an independent poll conducted between 11–13 November reported that the majority of surveyed Thai people wanted the protests to end. Faced with strong opposition, Yingluck issued a statement, urging the Senate to contemplate the bill with the interests of the people in mind. (Procedurally, the House could not recall the bill after voting; the decision lay with the Senate.) Pheu Thai Party leaders also promised not to revive the bill, or any other amnesty bills, if it was rejected by the Senate. The Senate subsequently voted on the bill on 11 November 2013, unanimously rejecting it. At the same time, the International Court of Justice confirmed Cambodia's sovereignty over disputed territory near the Preah Vihear Temple, prompting fears of further political tension from analysts, although the border remained calm. Despite the amnesty bill being dropped, protests in Bangkok continued. Suthep and eight other Democrat members of parliament resigned from their positions to lead demonstrations, calling for the general populace to strike and undertake civil disobedience. The protests gradually shifted towards an anti-government agenda, criticising Yingluck and her government for being proxies for Thaksin and being an elective dictatorship. Several groups protested, including Suthep's Civil Movement for Democracy, the Green Politics group, the Network of Students and People for Reform of Thailand (NSPRT), PEFOT, the Dhamma Army, and the State Enterprises Workers' Relations Confederation. Whistle blowing became a symbol of the protests. = Constitutional amendment = The first and last pages of the Constitutional Court's decision with the signatures of the judges On 20 November 2013, the Constitutional Court invalidated a government-proposed amendment to the 2007 constitution, which would have restored elements of the 1997 \\"People's\\" constitution. The major alteration would have been the restoration of a fully elected Senate. The court found that both the proceedings of the amendment and the contents of the new version were unconstitutional. The court ruled that the final draft voted on by the National Assembly was not the same as the one originally considered, and the new draft was brought to the sessions without an introductory motion. The court also decided that the time limit for amending the draft (which left only one day for the filing of amendments) was unlawful, and many MPs were found to have voted on behalf of absent MPs. With regard to the contents, the court said the amendment would have allowed the relatives of the representatives to become senators, weakening the ability of the Senate to scrutinise the House of Representatives. The 1997 constitution did not prohibit relatives of representatives becoming senators and resulted in the National Assembly gaining the infamous nickname \\"Assembly of Husbands and Wives\\" (สภาผัวเมีย). The court also held that the conversion of the Senate into a fully elected chamber would destroy the bicameral system. In its decision, the court stated: > The constitutional amendment pursuant to the petitions is a return to the > former defects which are perilous and likely to bring an end to the faith > and harmony of the majority of the Thai people. It is an attempt to draw the > Nation back into the canal, as it would bring the Senate back to the state > of being an assembly of relatives, assembly of family members and assembly > of husbands and wives. In consequence, the Senate would lose its status and > vigour as the source of wisdom for the House of Representatives, but would > merely be an echo of the people from the same group. The principles of the > bicameral system would be debased, leading to the monopoly of state powers > and the exclusion of the participation of the members of various sectors and > professions. The amendment is thus an effort of its initiators to regain the > national government power by the means not recognised by the Constitution > [...] Chulalongkorn University Dean of Law Nantawat Boramanand viewed the statement as an expression of disapproval towards the Pheu Thai-dominated House. The court held that it was competent to deal with the case to provide checks and balances to the principles of separation of powers. Some legal scholars argued that the court could not interfere with the constitutional amendment, as the National Assembly was not exercising the legislative power, but the constituent power which is not subject to the system of checks and balances between the three branches. The Pheu Thai Party rejected the decision, claiming that the court had no jurisdiction over the case, earning the Constitutional Court the nickname \\"San Khrai Fang\\" (ศาลใครฟัง; \\"court heeded by no one\\"). Although her party ignored the court decision and asserted the legality of the draft amendment, Yingluck withdrew the draft from King Bhumibol Adulyadej on 8 December 2013 before the King signed it into law. The Pheu Thai Party's denial of the court decision resulted in anti-government protest numbers swelling over the following weekend of 23–24 November 2013, with at least 100,000 protesters gathering at the Democracy Monument on Ratchadamnoen Avenue. Protest leaders claimed up to a million people joined the rally. The UDD-led Red Shirts, who had reconciled with the government after the amnesty bill was dropped and had been rallying its supporters at Rajamangala Stadium prior to the court decision, also resumed their counter- protest, with about 40,000 supporters arriving on 24 November. The National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) ruled on 7 January 2014 that it cleared 73 politicians, including Yingluck, in relation to the unsuccessful bid to create a fully elected senate. However, 308 others from the upper and lower houses were found to be in violation of Thai law. The announcement was only based on a preliminary investigation, but if the 308 members were officially found guilty by the commission, they could be banned from politics for five years by the upper house of the National Assembly, which would make the final decision on their cases. =Seizure of government buildings= Protesters mobilising on 1 December Demonstration at the Ministry of Labour, Bangkok On 25 November 2013, anti-government protesters from the People's Democratic Reform Committee led by Suthep began marched to several government offices and forced their way inside the Ministry of Finance, the Budget Bureau, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Public Relations Department, forcing their closure without police intervention, due to government fears that this could result in a repeat 2006 military coup. Yingluck invoked the Internal Security Act (ISA) in all districts of Bangkok and Nonthaburi Province, and the Bang Phli and Lat Lum Kaeo Districts of Samut Prakan and Pathum Thani Provinces respectively. (This was in addition to the central districts of Bangkok, where the ISA had been in effect since the previous month.) However, no direct confrontations between the protesters and security authorities occurred. The protesters continued on 27 November by rallying outside another ten ministry offices, cutting off electricity and forcing the evacuation of the Department of Special Investigation's headquarters, and staging a sit-in at the Chaeng Watthana Government Complex. Protesters also rallied at twenty-four provincial halls, mainly in the south, a traditional Democrat Party base of support. Protesters broke into the offices of state-owned telecommunications companies CAT and TOT on 30 November, disrupting internet services for several hours. The protests had been peaceful before short violent clashes on 30 November and 1 December 2013. On the night of 1 December, violence erupted between anti- government Ramkhamhaeng University students and Red Shirt government supporters near Rajamangala Stadium. University students attacked a taxi containing a red shirt supporter. Gunshots were fired at the students, resulting in four deaths and fifty-seven people wounded. The gunman was identified by an eyewitness as a Red Shirt protester, while PDRC core member Sathit Wongnongtoey claimed that \\"police officers had taken off their uniforms and donned red shirts to attack Ramkhamhaeng students in front of the university\\". UDD leaders subsequently ended their rally the following morning. Police guarding a barricade, Ministry of Education, 1 December Suthep, representing the newly created People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC; literal translation of the Thai name: \\"People's Committee for Complete Democracy with the King as Head of State\\"), had vowed to further escalate the protests on 1 December in a \\"people's coup\\" attempt. That day protesters tried to force their way into Government House and the Metropolitan Police headquarters, but were halted by police using barricades, tear gas, and water cannons. About 2,700 unarmed soldiers were called in to support the police. That afternoon, Yingluck cancelled planned media interviews and moved to an undisclosed location when the building she was in was surrounded by protesters. Protesters also entered several television stations, including the Thai Public Broadcasting Service, forcing them to broadcast a public address by Suthep, an act condemned by three media organisations. In a televised address, Suthep said that protesters had occupied twelve government buildings, but this claim was denied by the national security chief Paradorn Pattanathabutr. Suthep later unilaterally announced that he had met with Prime Minister Yingluck to deliver an ultimatum \\"to return power to people\\" within two days. He reaffirmed his stance that Yingluck's resignation or the dissolution of the House of Representatives was not acceptable, and repeated his calls to replace elected officials with an unelected \\"People's Council\\" that would choose leaders. Yingluck had rejected the demands on the basis that suspending the democratic process would be unconstitutional. On 3 December 2013, the police removed barricades and allowed protesters to enter the site, reducing tensions to allow both sides to celebrate King Bhumibol Adulyadej's birthday. =Electronic attacks= The Digital Attack Map website recorded relatively large scale distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks against internet services in Thailand corresponding almost directly to the period of demonstrations, 27 November through 20 December 2013. = Government dissolution = After the King's Birthday, Suthep called for protesters to take to the streets and march to Government House on 9 December in a \\"final battle\\". The protest was attended by 160,000 people. On 8 December, all 153 minority Democrat MPs jointly resigned in a move seen as trying to pressure further the government. In response to the intensive protests, Yingluck dissolved the House of Representatives on 9 December 2013 and proposed a general election for 2 February 2014, a date that was later approved by the election commission. The PDRC insisted that the prime minister stand down within 24 hours, regardless of her actions. Yingluck insisted that she would continue her duties until the scheduled election in February 2014, urging the protesters to accept her proposal: \\"Now that the government has dissolved parliament, I ask that you stop protesting and that all sides work towards elections. I have backed down to the point where I don't know how to back down any further.\\" Yingluck survived a no-confidence vote in the House of Representatives on 28 November 2013. Meanwhile, supporters of the NSPRT claimed the seizure of army headquarters, demanding that the military join the protests. In response, on 29 November Army Commander Prayut Chan-o-cha urged protest groups not to involve the military and called on rival sides to resolve the crisis peacefully. The government abstained from the use of excessive force, relying on batons, water cannons, and tear gas instead. Anti- government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, centre, with his wife Srisakul Promphan, in white, arrive at the Democracy Monument, Bangkok, 15 December 2013. =Post-government dissolution= On 17 December 2013, PDRC secretary Suthep called for rallies with slogans demanding: * Reform before election * Immediate resignation of Yingluck and the cabinet * Establishment of a non- elected People's Council to start a reform process for 12 to 18 months. On 21 December 2013, the Democrat Party announced that it would boycott the February elections. In response to the EC's registration process for party-list candidates for the scheduled election in February 2014, anti-government protesters marched to the Thai-Japanese sports stadium, the venue of the registration process, on 22 December 2013. Suthep and the PDRC led the protest, with the former declaring, \\"If the government and the EC still insist on the election, they are challenging the will of the people\\". Anti-government protests at Rajaprasong Intersection, Bangkok, 22 December 2013The PDRC estimated that 3.5 million people participated in the march on 22 December, while security forces claimed that approximately 270,000 protesters joined the rally. According to international sources, tens of thousands of protesters attended. Yingluck and the Pheu Thai Party reiterated their election plan and anticipated presenting a list of 125 party-list candidates to the EC. On 26 December 2013, protesters at the Thai-Japanese sports stadium clashed with police. Two persons, one of them a police officer, were killed. Protesters armed themselves with sling shots and wore gas masks to fight with police, and around 200 people were injured overall. Due to the escalation in violence, the election commission released a statement in which it urged the government to consider postponing the elections. Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana responded to the statement on behalf of the government, \\"February 2, 2014, was set as the election date in the royal decree dissolving Parliament, and there is nothing within the constitution or the law that gives the government the authority to change this date.\\" He explained further that the government remained open to discussions with protesters. On 27 December 2013, Thailand's army chief General Prayut Chan-o-cha released a statement to the media in which he did not rule out the possibility of a military coup, stating: \\"Whether it is going to happen, time will tell. We don't want to overstep the bounds of our authority. We don't want to use force. We try to use peaceful means, talks and meetings to solve the problem.\\" During the same period, an arrest warrant was issued for Suthep for insurrection, but police did not act on the order for fear of further disruption. =Occupation of Bangkok= Demonstrator mans a road block near the Ministry of Labour in Bangkok. As of 28 December 2013, 58 political parties were registered for the 2 February general election, after the EC concluded a five-day registration process on 27 December 2013. On the evening of 27 December, Suthep announced in a speech at the Democracy Monument in Bangkok that the anti-government protesters planned to shut down the Bangkok on 13 January 2014: > Bring your clothes, food and necessities for our victory may take months. > Bangkok residents should clear their work before the New Year. We will shut > down and occupy Bangkok a few days after the New Year. We won't leave even a > single inch to let people in the Thaksin regime to abuse us. Bangkok people > who feel uncomfortable will have time to manoeuvre, leaving those with the > hearts to fight to join hands in wiping out the Thaksin regime. As part of the speech, Suthep informed the public that the PDRC emptied its bank account before it was frozen at the order of the Department of Special Investigation (DSI), thereby allowing for the compensation of anyone who incurred damage as a result of the protests. Suthep stated that the relatives of the police officer murdered in the clash on 26 December would be given one million baht and that this sum would apply to any other deaths. Owners of damaged vehicles and motorcycles would also receive financial aid. On 2 January 2014, Suthep made a speech at the Rajadamnoen boxing stadium. In this speech he explained the plan for the protest action on 13 January, in which he said that he does not \\"...want Thailand to become a failed state.\\" According to Suthep, in addition to the closure of major intersections—Pathumwan, Suan Lumpini Park, Asoke, Lardprao and Ratchaprasong—all government offices would be disconnected from electricity and water, and government vehicles would be unable to use emergency lanes (left open for ambulances, people needing medical attention and public buses) on those roads that were occupied. At a press conference held on the same day, pro-government leader Jatuporn Promphan launched a new campaign to defend Bangkok against the protesters, whom he called \\"the elite's network\\". Jatuporn explained that pro-government forces will \\"fight under peaceful principles\\" and that further announcements would be made. On 4 January 2014, the head of the Center for the Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO), Surapong Tovichakchaikul, announced on live television that anyone who joined the protest movement would be in violation of the Thai Criminal Code. Surapong described Operation Occupy Bangkok as a serious threat to the stability of the nation and revealed that the government will enact a \\"capital protection\\" plan, involving the simultaneous use of combined forces, to cope with the shutdown. The involvement of the military was not mentioned in the telecast, but Surapong assured viewers that the government's plan complied with international standards. In a speech at the Democracy Monument on the evening of 4 January, Suthep announced that all of Yingluck's assets would be seized following the defeat of the \\"Thaksin regime\\". On 5 January 2014, Suthep led thousands of protesters through western Bangkok in a pre- shutdown march. According to PDRC spokesman Akanat Promphan, two further pre- shutdown marches were scheduled for 7 and 9 January. On the same day, caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck stated on her Facebook page that an election is the best way for the political conflict to be resolved, \\"If you don't want the government to return to power, you have to fight us in the election.\\" A clash between supporters from both political factions also occurred on 5 January in Thailand's northern city of Chiang Mai. On 6 January 2014, Yingluck's secretary general, Suranand Vejjajiva, informed the media that the government might implement an emergency decree in the event of violence during protest actions. To date, the military had maintained its neutrality and the secretary general explained that the government continued to respect this stance. In a second press conference, Caretaker Information and Communications Technology Minister, Anudith Nakornthap, spoke specifically of the possibility of violence, \\"The government is concerned for the safety of the people. If the demonstration is peaceful and lawful, it can go ahead. But several earlier rallies saw a number of groups violate the law—including the rights of others—by stirring up violence. The government would therefore like to implore those intent on using violence to think again.\\" Also on 6 January, Yingluck confirmed that an emergency decree was a last resort. She remained at her family home to monitor the political situation while police officers guarded her residence. Yingluck also explained that the Internal Security Act (ISA) will be used by the caretaker government to handle the mass protest. On the same day, Credit Suisse analysts, in a document titled \\"Thailand Market Strategy\\", stated: \\"Our worst-case scenario envisions a multi-year continuation of the events of the past eight years—frequent changes of government, raucous street protests and ever-present tensions—but no serious escalation of violence.\\" In relation to the Thai financial situation, analysts Dan Fineman and Siriporn Sothikul further explained: \\"For the broader market, a rebound is unlikely until investors are comfortable that the situation will not deteriorate further. We do not believe that we are yet at that point\\". Also on the same day, a Red Shirt conference was held in Nakhon Ratchasima Province to discuss the political crisis, including campaigns in response to a possible military coup. Over 5,000 coordinators and activists under the leadership of the United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) heard speeches by UDD chairwoman Thida Thawornseth, who spoke of preparations in the event that the military took power from the Yingluck government. Conference participants also discussed the response of the UDD to Operation Occupy Bangkok. On 9 January 2014, Yingluck expressed concern about the possibility of third-party involvement on 13 January, explaining that the CAPO will be monitoring the situation from the National Police Bureau office. Yingluck further explained, \\"violence is sometimes the work of a third party which is a concern...The answer to a resolution for the country does not rest with me. It's a matter of how we can cooperate so that Thailand moves forward and protesters are satisfied. I'm ready to co-operate.\\" Students from three universities demonstrated against the anti-government movement. Students of Kasetsart University, Silpakorn University, and Srinakharinwirot University lit \\"candles for peace\\" at their Bangkok campuses as part of their political action. At Kasetsart University, 1,000 citizens and students were cited: > We, Thai citizens who trust in peace and democracy, would like to use our > votes according to the constitution and request the all groups to discuss > and compromise to prevent violence. We support all political expressions as > soon as they are under the law and do not violate other's rights and > freedom. Election by citizens! At 02:30 on 13 January 2014, the Democrat Party headquarters was struck by bullets fired from a Toyota sedan. No injuries resulted. While the party had not yet joined the shutdown protest, it announced that it would join in boycotting the 2 February election. Plastic whistles in the shape of Thailand on sale by anti-government protest groups. Fashion accessories in the colours of the Thai flag are signature of anti-government protesters during Bangkok shutdown in January 2014. On the evening of 14 January 2014, another attack was made against the Democrat Party. The attackers attempted to bomb the home of Democrat Party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva. The attack failed and an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team discovered a US-manufactured M26 hand grenade pin. EOD team members inferred the hurling of a hand grenade onto the roof of the room where Abhisit's father normally stayed. The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration assisted police investigators in their review through the provision of surveillance tapes. Three men and a woman with four grenades, a gun, and ammunition were arrested at a Sukhumvit Road checkpoint on the same evening. The political situation became more complicated, with the National Anti-Corruption Commission investigating allegations that Yingluck was criminally negligent in her handling of a surplus rice deal with China. The commission had already implicated Yingluck's former commerce minister and more than a dozen other officials. Were the commission to deliver a guilty verdict, Yingluck would be impeached and forced to stand down. On 17 January 2014, PDRC security guards reported that two or three explosions were heard at Chaeng Wattana Road, Lumphini Park, Lard Prao intersection, and Suan Pakkad Palace. It was also reported that shots were fired from a black Honda Accord sedan with no injuries. The explosion and gunshots forced activities on the stage of the PDRC to halt temporarily. A hand grenade was also thrown at the Bangkok governor's home but no injury was sustained. On the same day, another grenade attack near the Lotus Charoenphol shopping mall injured thirty-eight protesters and killed one during a procession led by Suthep. PDRC security officers report that the grenade was launched from a partially demolished three-storey building. At 20:00 that evening, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's Erawan Emergency Medical Services Centre reported that thirty-eight casualties had been received. The following morning the report was updated to reflect that one person died, the ninth person killed since the 2013 crisis. The Metropolitan Police Bureau said that video clips examined by police showed two men acting in a suspicious manner. On 19 January 2014, a security guard based at the rally site of the Network of Students and People for Reform of Thailand (NSPRT) on Ratchadamnoen Nok Avenue was hospitalised by a gunshot from an unknown shooter. Journalist Andrew MacGregor Marshall expressed his belief that, \\"They [PDRC] know that they cannot win the February elections, so they will do all they can to prevent the polls from taking place\\", concluding that, \\"the prognosis for Thailand is depressingly bleak.\\" That afternoon, another bombing attack occurred in which 28 people were injured at the Victory Monument anti-government protest rally site. According to Thaworn Senneam, a former Democrat MP at the rally who believed that he was the target of the bomb, an unidentified man threw an explosive device near a press centre tent behind the rally stage and fled at 13:30. Dr Suphan Srithamma, Director-General of the Health Department, revealed on the day after the incident that four people had been killed and 238 injured in the anti-government protests thus far. On 19 January 2014, the armed forces remained in neutral. The army's Supreme Commander, General Thanasak Patimaprakorn, urged a peaceful outcome with the interests of the Thai nation of the utmost importance and that any further discussions should be undertaken with an independent mediator present. The general explained, \\"Both the government and the protesters may lose but the nation will gain. If they don't talk, we won't see the way,...\\" Niran Pitakwatchara, commissioner of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), stated on 19 January that the Yingluck administration needed to exercise caution in its interactions with PDRC leaders, as arrests may inflame the situation. Niran explained that, as the government would be held responsible for the loss of lives and injuries during the protest actions, government representatives and agents needed to be circumspect in all of their dealings with the protesters to reduce tension. The commissioner stated: > What must be urgently done is to reduce the stance of wanting to arrest PDRC > leaders because if such a strong stance continues, the problem would reach a > dead end. What's more, do not think of the protesters as the enemy of the > government and speed up clarifications and dialogue in a bid to reduce > violence. On 20 January 2014, National Security Council chief Paradorn Pattantabutr informed the Reuters news agency: \\"We're prepared to use the emergency decree...Everyone involved including the police, the military and the government is considering this option very seriously but has not yet come to an agreement\\", further explaining, \\"if their [anti-government protesters] tactics change and they close banks or government offices permanently then the chance for unrest increases and we will have to invoke this law.\\" On Monday, 3 February 2014, PDRC protesters allowed the re-opening of Lat Phrao and Democracy Monument areas to traffic after protesters dismantled their rally stages at the two locations and moved to strengthen their occupation in and around Lumphini Park. =State of emergency= Anti-government protesters gather at the intersection of Si Lom and Rama 4 Roads the day before the scheduled elections On 21 January 2014, a 60-day state of emergency was declared, providing the government with the authority to invoke curfews, censor the media, disperse gatherings, use military force to \\"secure order\\", detain suspects without charge, ban political gatherings of more than five persons and declare parts of the country inaccessible. According to Foreign Minister Surapong Tovichakchaikul, protesters had triggered the decision by blocking government offices and banks, and obstructing government officials from being able to conduct their business and lead their lives in a secure fashion. On 22 January 2014, Kwanchai Praipana, a leading figure of a pro- government faction, was shot in Udon Thani Province. Police concluded that the attack was politically motivated and used closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage as part of the investigation and reported the involvement of a \\"bronze pickup truck\\". Prior to the incident in Udon Thani, three grenade attacks killed one person and resulted in several injuries, but led to no arrests. Following news of the shooting, Suthep remained adamant regarding Operation Occupy Bangkok, stating \\"We will keep fighting until we win\\". He threatened to shut down Thailand's air traffic control. On the same day, the New York Times published an article containing interviews with a number of former and current EC members. EC member Somchai Srisutthiyakorn expressed a belief that the elections needed to be held at a suitable date to ensure that the \\"election benefits society\\". Somachai said, \\"I am afraid that if the election goes ahead, there will be violence and it may lead to a coup\\". The government had started impeachment proceedings against Somchai during the week of 13 January. The commissioner was accused of \\"dishonestly exercising or omitting to exercise any of his duties\\". According to the news article the charges were primarily symbolic, as the duration of the trial would be protracted, lasting many months, with the verdict to be announced well after the elections. On 24 January 2014, the Thai Constitutional Court declared that the postponement of 2 February election date was the prerogative of its members. At the time of the decision, the original amnesty bill proposal that triggered the first round of protests in late-2013 was no longer up for consideration. A nationwide Bangkok University poll of 1,018 voters revealed that four out of five Thais would cast a ballot on 2 February and more than two million voters had registered for the advance polls, according to an EC statement released on 24 January. On 26 January 2014, caretaker Labour Minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, (also the CMPO director), publicly announced the impending arrest of Suthep on the charge of leading an insurrection. Chalerm warned that if any loss of life occurred during the arrest, the police should not be blamed. A joint meeting involving the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) and the CMPO held on the same day announced that arrest warrants for 58 protest leaders had been processed. Under the conditions of the emergency decree, those who were arrested could be detained for 30 days before further legal action. DSI Director-General Tarit Pengdith informed the media that negotiations would commence between the CMPO and PDRC leaders to regain government control over occupied state agency offices. On the same day, Suthin Taratin, a Thai protest leader, was speaking on top of a truck as part of a rally at a polling station where advanced voting was to take place. He was struck by gunfire and later died of his injuries. Three others were injured and PDRC spokesman Akanat Promphan, stepson of Suthep, delivered a public announcement in which he stated: \\"Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, as the head of the government and the person who declared the state of emergency, must take responsibility for today's incidents, or else the public will revolt and call for justice.\\" On 27 January 2014, the caretaker Labour Minister (who was also the Director of the CMPO), Chalerm Yoobamrung, announced that protesters hindering access to government buildings would be arrested if they did not leave their positions within 72 hours. Chalerm stated that he will take full responsibility for the process and clarified that only those protesters at government buildings would be affected. The same day, Yingluck met with the EC to discuss the possibility of postponing the election due to the latter's fear of election day violence. Following a three-hour meeting at the Army Club, caretaker Deputy Prime Minister Pongthep Thepkanchana informed the media that the polling date remained unchanged. Election commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn stated that the EC would organise the 2 February vote to the best of its ability, including the enactment of measures to prevent violence and the staging of a second round of elections to accommodate voters hindered during the inaugural voting stage. Labor Minister Chalerm Yubamrung, recently appointed as the head of the government's crisis response agency, explained that 10,000 police officers would be mobilised to ensure the safety of voters during the election. During the meeting at the Army Club, violence broke out when a PDRC protester was shot in the abdomen. After the shooting, protesters attacked the suspected gunman who turned out to be a police officer. Police claimed that the undercover policeman only fired in self-defence after being attacked by PDRC protesters. Suthep Thaugsuban speaks on general election day at the Silom anti-government protest site. On 30 January 2014, further protests were held as part of the anti-election campaign. Protest leader Suthep led protesters through a section of the capital's commercial area, encouraging others to join election day actions to prevent voting. The police announced that a further 190,000 officers would be deployed throughout the nation, with an emphasis on Bangkok and Thailand's ten southern provinces. On the morning of 31 January, Chalerm was managing affairs at the civil court in Bangkok in response to the PDRC's bid for a court ruling to revoke the emergency decree. A petition was submitted to the court by PDRC core leader Thaworn Senneam and a decision was expected in the afternoon. Chalerm stated that the caretaker government's handling of the election situation would remain the same despite the PDRC submission. However, a new CMPO director would need to be appointed if the civil court sided with the PDRC petition. Chalerm stated, \\"I plead the premier to allow me to continue the job as I’m ready to work.\\" Chalerm threatened to arrest Suthep following the election. In Thaksin's hometown of San Kamphaeng, a reporter for the South China Morning Post spoke with pro-government supporters who stated that they were \\"willing to sacrifice\\" their lives in support of the ruling Puea Thai Party. Supporters said that they were prepared for Yingluck to relocate the capital to Chiang Mai, with Supon Fumuljaroen, vice-chairman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD) in Chiang Mai Province, stating, \\"The majority of red-shirts really like the idea of a separate state. If they stage a coup, we can live without Bangkok.\\" Pichit Tamoon, Chiang Mai general secretary for the UDD, said: \\"We have police forces on our side and together with the northeast we have the backing of 37 [out of 77] provinces. Yingluck will win.\\" Tamoon also responded to claims that the UDD was stockpiling weapons: \\"We have no arms but we have the police force on our side.\\" Suthep explained on the evening of 31 January that a confrontation and violence was not his intention. Suthep declared that polling places would be able to function normally. However, sources also stated that Suthep believed that the election date will be nullified because of various legal problems that would emerge afterwards. =February 2014 election= Despite an announcement by the PDRC that they would not hinder the election process, advance voting did not take place in 87 constituencies, mostly in Bangkok and the south of Thailand. Disruptions occurred in 10 of Thailand's 76 provinces. Protesters attempted to disrupt advance voting for the scheduled elections, with most gathering in Bangkok. According to EC Secretary-General Puchong Nutrawong, advance voting in the north and northeast had been accomplished with the exception of Surin Province. Of a total of 2.16 million people registered for advance voting nationwide, 916,210 of them in Bangkok, around 440,000 people were prevented from voting. Sunai Phasuk, a Human Rights Watch senior researcher said, > It's a sad day for democracy when the right to vote[...]is assaulted by a > political movement that claims to be striving for reform and people's > empowerment. Everything that happened today shows they are striving for the > opposite. In total, 48.7 million Thai citizens were eligible to vote for 500 seats in the lower house of parliament that represented 375 constituencies. In the polling booths, voters chose both one candidate and a single political party, while in the 22 constituencies that consisted of only a single candidate, more than 20 percent of the eligible votes must be received to achieve success. The smooth completion of 2 February election did not resolve Thailand's problematic political situation, as issues of remained: first, due to protester blockades, 28 constituencies across eight provinces—Chumphon, Surat Thani, Songkhla, Phuket, Phatthalung, Trang, Krabi, and Nakhon Si Thammarat—failed to register candidates. Second, the constitution required at least 475 filled seats, or 95 percent of the total number of seats, and disruptions caused by protesters meant that this target could not be reached. The EC, which believed that the final result would fall three seats short, explained that it would be necessary to hold by-elections over several months in problematic constituencies until all 500 members of the parliament's lower house were selected. In the 2011 elections, a 75 percent voter turnout rate was registered. The lawful distribution of ballots has been hindered by anti- government protesters. Although Lieutenant General Amnart confirmed that police would ensure the safety of those responsible for delivering the ballots, as of 1 January ballot papers stuck at post offices in Chumphon, Nakhon Si Thammarat's Thung Song District, and Songkhla's Hat Yai District were unable to reach southern polling stations. On 29 January, the Thai army announced is support of the CMPO operation to protect the election. Deputy army spokesman Winthai Suvari provided details of the deployment of military personnel in areas of particular concern and a joint operation with the CMPO to ensure the safety of state officials and others. The army's other key responsibilities involved providing medical aid in areas close to protest sites, as well as traffic co-ordination duties. Assistant national police chief Amnart Unartngarm stated that its 200,000 police officers, plus 1,450 rapid-deployment units, would guard 93,535 polling stations in 76 provinces plus Bangkok. On 31 January 2014, the EC realised that 44,000 more election officials would be needed on polling day, including 4,000 people to oversee voting booths in the Thai capital. An EC commissioner explained to the media that a total of 93,305 polling stations were being set up nationwide, but staff shortages were worst in the southern provinces, where 90 percent of polling stations were insufficiently staffed. In addition to the staffing problems, ballots for 14 southern provinces remained undelivered at central post offices in the provinces of Chumphon, Nakhon Si Thammarat, and Songkhla. The EC stated that the election should proceed legitimately in more than 66 provinces, with a second opportunity offered on 2 March for those constituencies that were unable to vote. An army spokesman stated that soldiers would protect all polling stations, but explained that force would not be employed to end conflict between voters and anti-government protesters. Also on 31 January, the EC consulted with a legal team to discuss the issue of the 28 constituencies in the southern provinces where candidate registration did not occur in late-December due to protests. The consultation was in anticipation of the possibility that opponents of the election might file lawsuits to invalidate the election based on the constitutional condition that voting must occur nationwide on a single day. EC chairman Supachai Somcharoen stated that the EC and its legal advisers would carefully examine the constitution to handle the matter, but also explained, \\"There are several factors that could invalidate the poll. But the EC has no authority to decide. It is the Constitution Court that has the authority to rule on the matter if petitions are lodged.\\" On the eve of the election date, violence erupted again in Bangkok after PDRC demonstrators blocked the delivery of ballot boxes from the Lak Si District office in northern Bangkok. A group of armed PDRC supporters started a gunfight and numerous gunshots were exchanged, leaving at least six people injured. As a consequence of the violence, the EC suspended Sunday voting in the Lak Si District. Voting was also cancelled in the provinces of Krabi, Chumphon, Trang, Phangnga, Phatthalung, Phuket, Ranong, Songkhla, and Surat Thani due to a shortage of ballots. Although Suthep repeatedly claimed that his cause is peaceful and \\"without weapons\\", photos and videos of the clash clearly showed protesters wearing the green armband of the PDRC guard with assault rifles. Suthep's statement, affirming that the demonstrations would not obstruct voting, was belied, as anti-government protesters blocked delivery of ballot boxes in addition to preventing people from voting. According to the EC, the final turnout for 2 February elections—counted from 68 provinces and excluding the nine provinces where voting was cancelled—was 47.72 percent, or 20,530,359 voters (voting was closed prior to the 15:00 cut-off time in some areas of these provinces). The highest participation rate was in Chiang Mai, where 827,808 voters, or 75.05 percent, participated from a total 1,103,069 eligible voters. Of the total ballots cast in Chiang Mai, 530,427, or 64.08 percent, were valid; 129,983, or 15.7 percent, were invalid; and 167,398, or 20.22 per cent, were no-vote ballots. For Bangkok metropolis, a total of 1,133,296 voters, or 25.94 percent, from a total of 4,369,120 eligible voters, cast their votes: 775,821, or 68.46 percent, were valid; 90,923, or 8.02 percent, were invalid; and 266,552, or 23.52 per cent, were no-vote ballots. The EC announced that as many as 20.1 million out of 43.024 million eligible voters voted in 68 provinces where voting was not disrupted by protests, with 71.38 percent of those ballots valid, 12.05 percent invalid and 16.57 percent \\"no-vote\\". The EC vowed to discuss the 28 constituencies where candidates were prevented from registering prior to the polls and stated that it would consult with legal experts before arriving at a decision. = Arrest warrants for protest leaders = Warrants for arrest were approved by the Thai Criminal Court on 5 February 2014 for protest leaders, who insisted that the decision would not affect their campaign even though the Court found sufficient evidence that the leaders had violated the emergency decree imposed in Bangkok, Nonthaburi, and parts of Pathum Thani and Samut Prakan Provinces. According to the warrants, the police could arrest the 19 persons and detain them at Region 1 Border Patrol Police Headquarters at Khlong 5 in Pathum Thani's Thanyaburi District for no more than seven days. The warrants were valid for one year. The court was to be notified of any arrest within 48 hours. DSI director-general Tarit Pengdith said that the CMPO had sent a team to negotiate with PDRC leaders for the opening of the Interior Ministry. The CMPO would then arrest the PDRC leaders if co-operation was not achieved by 15:00 on 5 February. As of 6 February, the PDRC leaders remained free. On 6 February, Suthep attempted to postpone his indictment on charges of premeditated and attempted murder for ordering, alongside former prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES) to take action against UDD members in 2010, resulting in more than 90 deaths. The PDRC protest leader had been ordered to report to the prosecution office by 13 February 2014. CMPO head Chalerm informed the media on 6 February that he planned to disguise himself with a moustache, sun glasses, and a hat to arrest Suthep. Chalerm explained that Suthep's hideout was at the Dusit Thani Hotel. On 7 February, Chalerm warned protesters who were at the Interior Ministry that if they did not leave within four days, 1,000 police officers and defence volunteers would redress the situation. The leading protester at the ministry, Khomsan Thongsri, responded with a commitment to allow workers to carry out their business while the demonstrators remained present at the site. Furthermore, as part of a case that was filed by PDRC co-leader Thaworn Senneam regarding the validity of the emergency decree, the Civil Court provided a 10 February 2014 deadline for the submission of statements by Yingluck, Chalerm, and police chief Adul Saengsingkaew. A ruling was expected on 12 February 2014. Additionally, National Security Council (NSC) Secretary Lieutenant General Paradon Patanatabutr informed the media that 12 teams were formed to enforce the arrest warrants for the 19 PDRC core leaders. He expressed confidence regarding the successful finalisation of the arrests. The Thai Criminal Court rejected the DSI's submission to obtain warrants for the arrest of 13 PDRC leaders—Somkiat Pongpaiboon, Somsak Kosaisuk, Jitrapat Kridakorn, Sakonthi Pattiyakul, Sombat Thamrongthanyawong, Seri Wongmontha, Thanom Onketphol, Luang Pu Buddha Issara or Suvit Thongprasert, Sawit Kaewwan, Komsan Thongsiri, Suchart Srisang, Dr Rawi Matchamadol and Nopporn Muangthaen—on 24 February 2014. A PDRC lawyer explained that the court dismissed the DSI's request because the facts surrounding the PDRC protests had changed. = Compensatory voting = On 7 February 2014, a six-hour EC meeting was convened and EC member Somchai explained afterwards that if elections were to be held in the 28 constituencies in which candidates were not able to register for polls, a written royal decree from the government would be necessary. The meeting unanimously decided to seek such a decree. The EC believed that it could hold new elections in the five provinces of Rayong, Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat and Petchaburi without difficulty. However, Somchai stated: \\"We are not quite sure if new elections could be successfully held in Prachuap Khiri Khan and Satun which have 222 and 300 polling stations, respectively\\", but added that the EC would reassess the situation again on 11 February 2014. EC Secretary-General Puchong Nutrawong said the EC had scheduled candidacy registration for 4–8 March, 23 March for the advance election, and 30 March for the Senate election. New election dates were announced by the EC on 12 February 2014 to create voting opportunities for those citizens who were unable to vote during the February elections. Advance voting was to be held on 20 April, while 27 April was the date for constituencies where elections could not take place on 2 February. Somchai, appointed the Election Commissioner, stated that the 27 April date applied to 28 constituencies in the south, and several in Bangkok. The PDRC disapproved of the new election dates. According to the Wall Street Journal on 13 February 2014, the number of protesters dwindled since December 2013, from 150,000 to around 5,000 people. In his briefing with the media, Chalerm proposed that, following the next round of elections, the government should carry out changes within 18 months to allow for a new election process. Chalerm's statements followed a post by Yingluck on her Facebook page that indicated an openness to the involvement of a third-party broker to help resolve the political conflict. = Democrat Party's unsuccessful request for election invalidation = On 4 February 2014, the Democrat Party forwarded a request to the Constitutional Court for the invalidation of the election, as well as the dissolution of the Puea Thai Party and the disfranchisement of its executives. As part of their request, the Democrats identified the election as an attempt by the government to acquire administrative power by unconstitutional means, in accordance with section 68 of the constitution, the same section the Democrats had successfully invoked to request the invalidation of the constitutional amendment in November 2013. Section 68 prohibits an attempt to undermine the \\"democratic regime of government with the King as Head of State\\", or to acquire administrative power by constitutional means, and empowers the Constitutional Court to stop such an attempt, to dissolve any political party guilty of it and to disfranchise the executives of the dissolved party for five years. The Puea Thai Party filed a counter-request in response to the Democrat Party on 5 February, seeking the dissolution and disfranchisement of the latter's executives on the grounds of section 68. The Puea Thai Party spokesperson said that the Democrat Party's request to invalidate the election is an attempt to topple the government outside the rule of democracy. On 12 February 2014, the Constitutional Court dismissed the requests of the two political parties, citing both sets of claims as ill-grounded. In an interview with the Bloomberg media company on 7 February 2014, Abhisit stated that he did not vote, explaining: \\"We are not saying no to elections, we are saying free and fair elections, and we have to build the circumstances to make sure that happens.\\" The former prime minister further explained that he does not support all of the positions that the PDRC takes, but he does \\"understand the anger and frustration of people over corruption that is taking place, and the anger at intimidation of political opponents which has been going on for I don't know how many years now.\\" In response to the reporter's question, \\"But why must the government step down when it was legitimately elected with the votes of 16 million people?\\", Abhisit replied: > They had that mandate, they ran the country for two years and then they > betrayed the mandate, betrayed the trust of the people by trying to push > through the amnesty bill, which they said they campaigned on during the > election, but did not. And that led to mass protests. They dissolved the > House and announced a caretaker government. The caretakers cannot pursue > policy, so if the people are demanding somebody they can trust to oversee > the election after some initial reforms take place, why can't the government > make some sacrifices to ensure the country moves forward? = Retaking of public space = Operation Valentine was enacted on 14 February 2014, a traditional Buddhist holiday in Thailand, as police attempted to reclaim public space from the Students and People Network for Thailand's Reform protest group. Police first assembled at the Royal Plaza before moving onto the Misakawan Intersection to begin the operation. Tents were removed from Rachadamnoen Road on the Makkhawan Bridge, but the protesters had already relocated by the time the police arrived, so no violence occurred. Riot police also cleared a protest site that had been established at a major intersection near Government House and faced no resistance from protesters. Chalerm Yubamrung, chief of the government's special security operations, explained to the media that the operation is an indication of the caretaker government's response to the protest movement. Chalerm explained: \\"We urge the protesters to go home. If they don't listen, we will have to take further action. We can't let this happen. Our country can't function like this.\\" Police refrained from taking action after a group of demonstrators returned to an intact protest site near Government House. About 1,000 protesters then gathered outside Bangkok police headquarters following the operation. On the evening of 14 February, Suthep said in a speech that he refused to engage in a discussion with Yingluck, regardless of the presence of a neutral third party, citing previous experience that undermined his confidence in the caretaker prime minister's ability to think for herself. \\"I am not that crazy to talk with a puppet with someone [Thaksin] pulling the strings from behind.\\" On the morning of 18 February, nine police companies succeeded in retaking the Energy Ministry site and arrested more than 140 protesters after the protest group refused to leave the area. As the police continued to reclaim five protest sites, the situation deteriorated into violence at the Phan Fah Bridge protest site on Ratchadamnoen Klang Avenue. Protesters resisted police orders by sitting down on the road and praying. Police advanced with little violence and later commenced knocking down a stage and tents. The situation worsened when a growing numbers of protesters obstructed the officers. Police deployed tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse them. As the police moved forward, they were attacked by bombs and gunshots. Police responded with live ammunition, then retreated. A BBC video clip clearly showed a grenade was thrown at police lines from the group of protesters. As of 19 February 2014, five deaths were registered—one police officer and four civilians—and at least 64 people were injured from the Phan Fah Bridge conflict. A BBC report, published on 18 February, stated that the government announced its intent to reclaim all occupied sites by the end of 23 February 2014. The Southeast Asian Regional Office for the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) denounced the protest violence in an official press statement that was released on 21 February 2014: > OHCHR calls on anti and pro-government sides to disassociate themselves from > armed groups, and refrain from any form of violence. OHCHR calls on leaders > of both sides and security forces to ensure the safety of those genuinely > engaging in peaceful demonstrations, and to make sure that all sides > strictly comply with the law. OHCHR further calls upon the authorities to > carry out a prompt, full and impartial investigation to establish the facts > and to ensure accountability for this and other similar violence incidents > that have occurred over the past months. Further violence, deaths, and injuries occurred on 22 and 23 February 2014 at two separate PDRC protest sites in Bangkok and the town of Trat, about 300 km (186 mi) southeast of the Thai capital. In Bangkok, a rally on 23 February occurred outside a large shopping mall on Ratchadamri Road and it was reported that the explosion of a 40mm grenade caused the death of three people, two children and a woman. A male tuk-tuk driver was arrested following the incident. Gunfire and grenades were responsible for one death and 34 injuries in Trat on the evening of 22 February. Following the incidents of 22 and 23 February 2014, PDRC protesters in Bangkok attempted to hinder the activity of the Shinawatra family's businesses on 24 February, at the Customs Department in Khlong Toey, the Voice TV station, and various ministries. = Closure of rally sites = On the evening of 28 February, Suthep announced the closure of the rally sites at Prathum Wan, Ratchaprasong, Silom, and Asoke on 2 March 2014, and apologised to those people inconvenienced by the Bangkok occupation. The PDRC relocated to Lumphini Park, marking the end of the \\"Bangkok Shutdown\\", where the PDRC rally stage was established. Chaeng Watthana is the only other remaining rally stage, overseen by a senior monk who said: \\"I will not dismantle or move it [the stage] anywhere\\" following Suthep's announcement. According to Suthep, from 3 March onwards, boycotts and disruption of the Shinawatra family's business interests will be the primary focus of the anti-government protest movement. A new leader of the pro- government Red Shirt movement was appointed on 15 March 2014 to replace Tida Tawornseth, at a rally of 10,000 supporters in Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok. Former MP Jatuporn Prompan, who remained involved with legal proceedings that date back to the 2010 political crisis, assumed the leadership position and spoke with the AFP news agency on the following day. The new leader declared that a \\"big fight\\" is required in the future, but any Red Shirt action will be \\"peaceful\\". Jatuporn referenced the failed anti-government actions in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and stated that the Suthep-led movement \\"cannot achieve success\\". On 20 March 2014, the president of the Thai Farmers body informed the media that farmers from numerous provinces will convene at the Ministry of Commerce to implore the government to stand down. President Ravi Roongreung explained that the government's inefficient handling of farming issues was the primary reason for the protest action. = Ombudsman's request for election invalidation = Phahurat Road. The ombudsman also sought to have the general election of 2 February 2014 invalidated following advice from Thammasat University journalism law lecturer Kittipong Kamolthammawong. The ombudsman's authority concerns constitutionality of law, rather than election- related matters. In light of the limitation of his authority, the ombudsman then filed a request on 6 March 2014 for the Constitutional Court to decide if the royal decree, whereby the House of Representatives was dissolved, was unconstitutional. On 21 March 2014, the Constitutional Court, by six votes to three, ruled that the royal decree was contrary to the constitution—insofar as it affected the election—when the general election, scheduled for 2 February 2014, could not be completed on that day throughout Thailand. The constitution stipulates that only a royal decree can dissolve the House of Representatives and it must also order a general election to be held on the same day nationwide, within 45 days of the dissolution. According to the court, at the point that the royal decree was deemed unconstitutional, the election also became unconstitutional as a consequence. The Constitutional Court decision received heavy criticism from academic sectors and the Pheu Thai Party. Thammasat University public law lecturer Piyabutr Saengkanokkul commented that nothing in the royal decree was contrary to the constitution, as it did not fail to comply with the requirements of the constitution mentioned by the court. Chulalongkorn University constitutional law lecturer Kanin Boonsuwan questioned the logic of the decision, because the activity that the constitution required of the decree could not be completed due to hindrance from the anti-government protesters. Chulalongkorn University political science lecturer Pornson Liengboonlertchai added that a law is deemed unconstitutional when its contents are contrary to the constitution, not when it is prevented from being implemented according to the constitution. Legal scholar Verapat Pariyawong noted that the court invalidated the election because it was not completed within one day, but the court refrained from considering why it could not be completed. Political analyst Kan Yuenyong said, \\"independent agencies are being quite obvious that they want to remove her [Yingluck] and her entire cabinet to create a power vacuum, claim that elections can't be held and then nominate a prime minister of their choice\\". Chiang Mai University law lecturer Somchai Preecha-silapakul said he was grieved by the decision and described it as a \\"constitutional coup\\". Former judge and former EC member Sodsri Sattayatham criticised the court for freezing the country and encouraged people to vote in the new election to \\"bring back democracy\\". The Pheu Thai Party lamented the decision, stating that the country had lost an opportunity to move on and that the court had established an \\"infamous standard\\" by which an entire election can be overturned because of disruptions at some polling stations. Opposition MP Chuwit Kamolvisit issued a similar statement: \\"[The court has set] a standard that if you want to overturn an election, you just find someones to block a few polling stations....Just do this and you can make the whole election void.\\" On 21 March, a group of students using the slogan \\"Respect My Future\\" gathered at the Democracy Monument and covered it with black cloth to mourn for democracy. Another group launched a campaign called \\"Respect My Vote\\" in front of Lord Rattanathibet's Mansion, the Constitutional Court's former seat, with a view to demanding the resignation of the Constitutional Court judges on the grounds that they \\"devalued the people's votes\\". Ceremonies were held in Benchasiri Park, Bangkok, featuring floating black balloons and black candles, to bid farewell to democracy and deplore the court. Pheu Thai Party members said they would dress in black for six days in mourning for the six judges who resolved to invalidate the election, while medical officers in Chiang Mai Province also donned black clothing. The Democrat Party's Ongart Clampaiboon that Pheu Thai should respect the court ruling, and that the next election should not be too early or it might be invalid again. One of the PDRC's co- speakers, Ekkanut, stated immediately after the ruling that PDRC respected the ruling and that Yingluck's government was \\"stubborn\\" about finishing the election process while it was not yet ready. He added that this might be a good chance for everyone to co-operate on reform before election. Suthep declined to make any comment on the ruling. Anti-government protesters applauded the decision and vowed to disrupt new elections until an unelected people's council is achieved. = Continued protests and violence = Cases of intimidation, violence and criminal activities, committed by PDRC guards and supporters, continued. Police arrested in Surat Thani, Suthep's hometown, a man who confessed to being paid by the PDRC to shoot at pro-government Red Shirt protesters the day before the election at Lak Si, leading to seven people injured and one man paralysed. The \\"popcorn gunman\\", who fired a M16 rifle, also admitted that a PDRC guard leader provided him with the weapon. Warrants were issued by the court for the arrest of Issara Somchai, a former Democrat MP from Ubon Ratchathani and PDRC leader, and five PDRC security guards. Issara was accused of ordering his guards to detain, beat, and kill a civilian after they found him with Red Shirt supporters cards. The man was allegedly detained for five days, beaten, tied up and thrown into the Bang Pakong River by anti-government protest guards. A PDRC supporter known as \\"little Saddam\\", who was photographed trying to strangle a man who had tried to vote, was also sought. Pro-government demonstrators from the People's Radio for Democracy Group (PRDG), a faction of the UDD, rallied at the National Anti-Corruption Commission office on 24 March 2014. Four members of the PRDG proceeded to assault a Buddhist monk named Phra Prat, who received minor injuries. According to Phra Prat, he saw protesters assaulting another man, so he complained to the protesters. One of the PRDG attackers claimed that Phra Prat was not a real monk and was going to attack her with his cane. She also blamed the monk for scolding them in the first place. On 29 March 2014, a group of anti-government protesters from the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) were led by Suthep on a march around Bangkok streets, from Lumpini Park to the Royal Plaza and parliament. The march eventually returned to Lumpini Park to affirm its stance that reforms must be carried out before a general election is undertaken. While 53 political parties called for a fresh election to be held within 45–60 days, the Democrat Party echoed Suthep's position: the ruling Pheu Thai Party would use the power it won in a fresh election to pass illegitimate laws. The party did not elaborate on its planned involvement in the next election. At the PDRC rally at Lumpini Park on 5 April 2014, Suthep outlined his strategies in the campaign to remove Yingluck from her role as caretaker. He called on all PDRC local networks to gather lists of their members throughout Thailand and \\"wait for the day of battle\\", further explaining that he would lead \\"a prolonged fight\\" that will last \\"for at least 15 days\\". The outcome of two events were presented as critical to the course of Suthep's future actions: the NACC's ruling on Yingluck and the verdict by the Constitutional Court on whether Yinluck violated the 2007 Constitution. In the event of a guilty finding by the NACC, Suthep asked his supporters to await further instructions. However, if the Constitutional Court ruled against Yinluck, Suthep called for an immediate mass mobilisation so that he could assume the role of \\"sovereign body\\" to enact a new charter, akin to the military dictators of the 1960s. Suthep stated as a reassurance: \\"[I] will be able to order anyone to be executed by firing squad, but I will only freeze assets\\". If he assumed a ruling position, Suthep stated that he planned to appoint a prime minister and cabinet members at his discretion, followed by a request for approval from Thailand's king, so that he might appoint a National Legislative Assembly and \\"People's Council\\"—two unelected legislative bodies—to engage in national \\"reforms\\". Suthep expressed a commitment to return power to the Thai people following the implementation of the reforms, but spoke of further street-based protests if his appointed government failed to implement the reforms dictated by the PDRC. On 25 April 2014 a soldier was removing a barrier placed near the anti-government protest site on Chaeng Watthana when protest guards opened fire at him. The attack ended after the guards viewed his military identification card. = Request for removal of Yingluck from office = Over two years prior, on 30 September 2011, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) transferred Thawin Pliansri from the office of Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) to the office of Prime Minister Advisor. Police General Wichian Photphosri, then Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police (RTP), was appointed as the NSC Secretary General instead, and Police General Priewpan Damapong, elder brother of Thaksin's former wife Potjaman Shinawatra, was appointed as the new RTP Commissioner General. Thawin requested an administrative court to revoke the transfer. The Supreme Administrative Court delivered a final judgment on 7 March 2014 that the transfer was legal, but was unreasonable because it did not appear that Thawin had carried out his duties ineffectively or failed to abide by the policy of the government. The court ordered the OPM to transfer Thawin back to his former office within 45 days. The OPM announced the transfer on 28 April 2014, retroactive to 30 September 2011. Appointed Senator Paiboon Nititawan then requested the Constitutional Court to remove Yingluck from office, citing that the transfer of Thawin was the exercise of power to interfere with governmental affairs in favour of Yingluck's family or the Pheu Thai Party. The constitution prohibits a representative, senator or minister from, for his or her own sake or for the sake of his or her political party, interfering with regular government affairs, including the transfer, appointment, promotion, demotion, or removal of governmental officers. On 3 April 2014, the Constitutional Court agreed to address the case and ordered Yingluck to reply within 15 days. Yingluck replied: # The transfer was not interference, but the usual exercise of authority which she is legally empowered to exercise. # The transfer was not done for the purpose of allowing Priewpan to become the new RTP Commissioner General. The candidates to the office were not selected by her. # Even though Priewpan is the elder brother of Potjaman, Potjaman and Thaksin had already divorced. # She cannot be removed from office any longer because she had already vacated it when the House of Representatives was dissolved. The constitution prescribes that the council of ministers vacates office upon dissolution of the House of Representatives, but it shall continue to function until a new council is formed. The final hearing was held on 6 May 2014. The court rendered its decision on 7 May 2014, stating that Yingluck could still be removed from office as her office exists until a new council of ministers is formed. The court decided that the transfer of Thawin involved her personal interest, saying: > [Since] Police General Priewpan is the maternal [great] uncle of the > grandchildren of the Respondent, he could be deemed a relative of the > Respondent. It is therefore reasonable to believe that the acts of the > Respondent were not for the sake of the Nation and its people, but were done > with a concealed or hidden intention to favour the Respondent herself or her > partisans. The court then unanimously removed her from office. It also removed nine other ministers voting in favour of the transfer. These ministers were Anudith Nakornthap (Minister of Information and Communication Technology), Chalerm Yubamrung (Minister of Labour), Kittiratt Na-Ranong (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance), Plodprasop Suraswadi (Deputy Prime Minister), Police General Pracha Promnok (Minister of Justice), Santi Prompat (Minister attached to the OPM), Siriwat Kajornprasart (Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives), Surapong Tovichakchaikul (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs) and General Yuttasak Sasiprapa (Deputy Minister of Defence). The remaining ministers selected Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister Commerce) to act as caretaker prime minister in place of Yingluck. Tight security was placed around court precincts during the televised pronouncement of the decision and the judges left the court immediately after the pronouncement. The court appeared to overturn its own precedent. On 5 February 2014, it dismissed a similar petition against Abhisit Vejjajiva, citing that he had already vacated office upon dissolution of the House of Representatives. The New York Times also noted that the court reached the decision with \\"unusual speed\\" as it was delivered just one day after Yingluck gave evidence to the court, while The Wall Street Journal reported that the grounds for which Yingluck was removed were \\"relatively obscure\\". After hearing the decision, Yingluck held a press conference during which she denied all the accusations. The pro-government Red Shirt faction leaders described the decision as a \\"judicial coup\\" and said they will hold a mass rally to protest her removal on 10 May 2014, prompting the Constitutional Court to order its own holiday from 8–13 May 2014. = Post Yingluck's removal = PDRC leader Suthep launched his \\"final battle\\" with media intimidation. On 9 May at 09:09, protesters marched to the buildings of Channels 3, 5, 7, 9 and NBT, where they stayed overnight to make sure the stations did not deviate from PDRC-approved coverage. According to Suthep, these media agencies are \\"mouthpieces\\" of the government and must be convinced to refrain from broadcasting any more pro-government \\"propaganda\\". They must not report the news on behalf of the tyrants any longer, because it distorts the truth, adding that he intended to ask for co-operation from these stations to broadcast his speech once \\"victory\\" is achieved. The Thai Journalists Association, the Thai Broadcast Journalists Association, and human rights groups condemned the PDRC move. The intimidation campaign occurred previously during the Bangkok Shutdown campaign. Meanwhile, those led by Luang Phu Buddha Issara went to CMPO headquarters, where violence erupted between protesters and police. Protesters dismantled barricades and demanded that CMPO send out a representative to talk to them within five minutes. When the five minutes had passed, the protesters broke in, causing police to fire tear gas and water cannons at them. The protesters withdrew. The violence resulted in four protesters injured, included the leader himself. The following day, after negotiations with Col Sombat Thanyawan, deputy commander of the Cavalry Centre who supervised security at Government House, Suthep and the PDRC were granted permission to enter the Santi Maitree building. The Santi Maitree is the building at Government House where the cabinet ministers' offices are located. The building was to be used as an office and meeting place for the PDRC.http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/pdrc-protests/409110/government-house- new-pdrc-base The UDD staged a rally at Aksa Road on 10 May to show support for the recently removed Yingluck and other cabinet members. \\"I plead with the president of the Supreme Court, which is one of the three pillars of democracy, to reconsider thoroughly the demands by Mr Suthep and the subsequent proposal made by the not-yet-validly nominated Senate speaker to hold a meeting and appoint a new prime minister,\\" said Jatuporn Prompan, leader of the UDD. The Red Shirt leader warned that any attempt by the Supreme Court and the Senate to discuss \\"unlawful\\" demands for an interim government could steer Thailand toward a civil war. The PDRC relocated their main rally site from Lumphini Park to Ratchadamnoen Nok Avenue, not far from Government House on 11 May. A clean up operation took place in Lumphini Park two days later. = Coup d'état = On 20 May 2014, the Royal Thai Army intervened by declaring martial law nationwide and establishing a military command to resolve the situation. The caretaker government stated that the army never sought its opinion on the martial law declaration. The army insisted that the move was not a coup d'état and the government remained in office. On the evening of 22 May 2014, the army formally staged a coup against the caretaker government and formed a junta called National Peace and Order Maintaining Council (NPOMC) to govern the country. On 21 August 2014 army chief General Prayut Chan-o-cha was appointed prime minister by a legislature he had handpicked. Rice-pledge scheme crisis Concurrent to the 2013–2014 political crisis in Thailand, the rice-pledge scheme has been a significant issue for the caretaker government. Following the dissolution of parliament on 9 December 2013, Yingluck and her Cabinet neglected to approve a renewed budget for the rice pledge. As of 31 January 2014, the caretaker government had not only defaulted on the payments that are owed to the nation's rice farmers as part of the scheme, but caretaker Finance Minister Kittiratt Na Ranong does not have access to the Bt130 billion that is required to resolve the situation. In its reduced \\"caretaker\\" capacity, the Finance Ministry is constitutionally barred from borrowing money that would create obligations for the next government. The sum of Bt130 billion has been owed to the nation's rice farmers since October 2013 and, as of 31 January 2014, more than 200 farmers have sought the help of the Lawyers' Council with representation in a class action against the government. While the rice farmers of Thailand are the lowest class in the Thai social hierarchy, they are also traditionally a key component of the Pheu Thai Party's political base. As of 31 January 2014, rice farmers, predominantly from the North and Central regions, have blocked highways to protest against the government and have also stated that they may travel to Bangkok to join the anti-government protest. Many farmers are bankrupt as a result of the outstanding payments and at least three farmers under the scheme have committed suicide. The Thai Ministry of Commerce announced on 4 February 2014 that China cancelled a contract to purchase more than a million tonnes of rice due to a continuing investigation of the Anti- Corruption Commission into a rice purchase policy administered by Yingluck. The protesting farmers announced that they would intensify their protest on 6 February 2014 by blocking all of Thailand's major roads, even though many farmers from the north of the country could not afford to participate. The protesting rice farmers—1.4 million farmers in total have been affected—are seeking compensation from the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Co- operatives (BAAC), as they believe that the bank can recoup the payment from the government at a later time; however, the BAAC has stated that it relies upon the government for funds. Additionally, a number of farmers from the Central provinces might travel to Bangkok and demand payment in front of the Commerce Ministry on 6 February. Suthep announced to supporters in Silom on 6 February that one potential solution to the rice farmers predicament is to sell the government's 8 million-tonne stock of pledged rice; however, PDRC- organized protesters would need to forcibly enter secured warehouses to retrieve the rice. One of the PDRC core leaders stated that Suthep would embark on a public walk on 7 February to collect donations for the rice farmers. According to Rangsan Srivorasart, Permanent Secretary for Finance, on 7 February, a confidential plan involving Thailand's banks will ensure that the rice farmers will be paid through a Bt130 billion loan. Rangsan stated that several options existed to obtain the necessary funds. In a statement to the media on 11 February, Yingluck stated that the government possessed the financial means to pay all outstanding debts to the nation's rice farmers and was adamant that the payments will be honoured at the stipulated prices. However, a Bangkok Post report, published on 12 February 2014, states that the National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) is expected to bring formal charges against Yingluck following the collation of evidence to substantiate a case regarding the rice scheme. NACC deputy secretary-general Witthaya Akhompitak said on 11 February that the NACC expects to press charges against the caretaker Prime Minister. Witthaya explained that if the NACC panel accumulates enough evidence, Yingluck, who is also chairwoman of the National Rice Policy Committee, would be in violation of Section 157 of the Criminal Code for dereliction of duty and, if charged, will be permitted to present her case to the panel—the panel will then decide if the indictment of Yingluck is justified. The case dates back to mid-January 2014 and, if the case is taken to court, Yingluck would be required to step down from all official roles. Meanwhile, caretaker Commerce Minister Niwatthamrong Bunsongphaisan stated that a cabinet meeting held on 11 February approved a central budget of Bt712 million to pay a total of 3,921 undocumented farmers under the rice scheme and the budget will be forwarded to the EC for endorsement between 11 and 14 February 2014. On the evening of 12 February, Thai Rice Association president Prasit Boonchoey warned that around 50,000 rice farmers to oust the caretaker government due to the outstanding payments. Prasit spoke on one of the PDRC protest stages, confirming that he had spoken with other farmer leaders from the western, lower northern, and upper central regions in regard to escalating the protest action. On the morning of 13 February, another group of farmers were escorted by lawyers from the Lawyers Association of Thailand to file legal charges against the caretaker government for fraudulent conduct. On the evening of 14 February, farmer leader Dhaicharn Mata warned Yingluck that the consequences will be \\"unpredictable and uncontrollable\\" if the farmers demands are not met. Rice farmers used a truck to overcome razor wire barricades at one of Yingluck's temporary offices in the Chaeng Wattana area. The caretaker prime minister refused to meet with the farmers, but government officials identified the dissolution of parliament in December 2013 as the cause of the payment delay. Caretaker Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-Ranong informed the media that Bt2 billion had already been paid and a further Bt3.39 billion is owed to the farmers. He said the government will pay the remainder of the debt through the state-owned agricultural bank: \\"Considering the (bank's) capacity in handling daily payments, it is expected that all payments will be made within six to eight weeks.\\" On 18 February 2014, Yingluck delivered a speech to respond to the desperation of the rice farmers and detailed how the issue will be resolved. Yingluck also explained that the anti-government protest movement has acted as an obstacle to the successful continuation of the scheme, which she claimed had been functional during its first two years of existence prior to the 2013–2014 political crisis. Yinluck affirmed that, regardless of the obstacles, she would \\"persist in fighting for the farmers\\"; however, the caretaker prime minister called upon the co-operation of Thailand's banks, whereby loans would be granted to the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC) for the payment of rice farmers: > With a solid guarantee under the law, there are no reasons for the banks and > their unions to fear that their money would be used in the wrong way. The > government is responsible for every baht. Moreover, the country's financial > institutions are very strong with high liquidity. They can comfortably > provide loans to help farmers without taking too much risk. Yingluck further stated that the BAAC will extend the debt repayment time by six months due to the hardships endured by the farmers, in addition to increasing the loan limit for the upcoming crop season. The speech was telecast nationwide by the Television Pool of Thailand. However, also on 18 February, the National Anti-Corruption Commission released a statement charging Yingluck with improperly handling the government's rice subsidy scheme. The Commission states that the scheme involved the government's purchase of farmers' crops for prices up to 50 per cent higher than global prices over a two-year period. The caretaker prime minister received a summons to face the Commission's charges on 27 February 2014, and her impeachment and removal from official duties is one potential outcome. EC member Somchai Srisutthiyakorn announced on 4 March 2014 that the caretaker government received the approval of the EC to pay the rice farmers who joined the rice- pledging scheme with Bt20 billion from the nation's central fund. The money will be dispensed as a loan to the government, which will use the revenue from rice sales to repay the amount by 31 May 2014. Led by monk Phra Buddha Issara, a group of farmers dumped rice at the Government Lottery Office (GLO) on 22 March 2014, leading to the closure of the office for the day. The monk demanded that the GLO use lottery sale funds to purchase 100 tonnes of rice from farmers and stated that the Office needs to pay the farmers at least THB12,000 for each tonne of rice. Impact of political crisis On 23 December 2013, the Thai baht dropped to a three-year low due to the political unrest in the preceding months. According to Bloomberg News, the Thai currency lost 4.6 percent over November and December, while the main stock index also dropped (9.1 percent). A chief Japanese trader on emerging Asian markets told Bloomberg News: \\"There is no reason to buy the baht or Thai assets while the protests continue.\\" In terms of tourism, Thailand's Association of Domestic Travel reported a decrease of US$125 million worth of tourist revenue around Christmas and New Year compared to the same period in 2012. The Thai-Chinese Tourism Alliance Association has projected that, for Q1 2014, Chinese arrivals are expected to drop 60 per cent from 900,000 compared with the same period in 2013 (in 2013, Chinese nationals were responsible for the highest level of tourism in Thailand). On 6 January, Singapore Airlines stated that it will cancel 19 flights due to the political situation in Bangkok, while travel agencies have experienced a decline in patronage. The Bank of Thailand reported on the second day of the anti-government Operation, 14 January 2014, that 135 different bank branches had been affected. It said 36 branches announced full day closure, including three Bangkok Bank branches, 17 Krungthai branches and five Siam Commercial branches, while 99 others closed ahead of regular business hours, including 72 Thai Military branches and 10 CIMB branches. According to data compiled by Thailand's Financial Ministry, Bloomberg L.P. and the Stock Exchange of Thailand, foreign investors have withdrawn US$3 billion (nearly THB100 billion) from Thai stocks since protests began on 31 October 2013. Analysts are commenting on the benefits being reaped by Thailand's neighbouring countries and the Thai Stock Exchange has traced approximately THB6.3 billion that has moved to Indonesian shares. On 23 January 2014, Tourism and Sports Minister Somsak Phurisisak stated that the total number of visitors to Thailand will drop to one million in January 2014, half of the usual tourist population for the month. A representative from Barclay's, a UK multinational banking and financial services company, reiterated the repetitive history of the protest movement and further explained: \\"It's not the first time this has happened. What's damaging is perceptions, investment and tourism. It's all reversible at the moment, but as time goes by some of it will become permanent.\\" On 27 January 2014, the Erawan Center, an emergency medical service unit of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), announced that 10 deaths had occurred during the anti- government protests, while 571 injuries had been documented. An increase in tension has been identified in the lead-up to 2 February elections. According to a 12 February media report, Bangkok businesses were hopeful for a resolution to the political unrest, as the financial impact had become more problematic. CentralWorld, one of Southeast Asia's largest shopping plazas, reported that customer traffic was down 20 per cent from 2013, Japanese department store operator Isetan's Bangkok location had been closing an hour earlier, the Ratchaprasong district's accommodation venues experienced a 60 per cent decline in patronage, and only 5,000 tourists were frequenting popular foreign backpacker destination Khaosan Road on a daily basis, representing a 50 per cent drop. On the same date, the central Bank of Thailand downgraded its GDP growth projection for 2014 from 4 per cent to 3 per cent. An economic data report published on 17 February stated that GDP increased 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2013, the country's lowest level of growth since the first quarter of 2012. The data also showed that the nation's currency has weakened by 4 per cent since the commencement of the protests. Bank of Thailand spokeswoman Roong Mallikamas stated that the monetary policy as of 17 February is sufficient to accommodate the nation's needs. On 13 April 2014, Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai academic based at Chulalongkorn University's Institute of Security and International Studies in Bangkok, assessed the 2014 political crisis for the East Asia Forum, a joint initiative of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research (EABER) and the South Asian Bureau of Economic Research (SABER). Thitinan writes that \\"Yingluck’s days are numbered\\" and foresees two potential outcomes for Thailand: \\"If it is a government that includes both sides of the divide, Thailand may be able to navigate a way out. But if it is a partisan anti-Thaksin interim government, more tumult and turmoil can be expected.\\" The academic expresses his support for a democratic process, as he concludes with the statement, \\"Thais must realise that the starting point for any democracy is the will of the majority and that autocratic rule in Thailand ultimately cannot last.\\" The private Thai think tank Kasikorn Research Center (KResearch) reported in mid-April 2014 that Thailand was at risk of entering into a recessionary period due to the ongoing political turmoil in the nation. The Center presented data that indicated an absence of growth in Thai exports during the first quarter of 2014, similar to the final quarter of 2013, while a minus growth of 1.8 percent continued beyond this period. The think tank predicted about 1.8 percent growth for Thailand's economy over 2014; however, Bangkok Bank executive vice-president Kobsak Pootrakool estimated an annual growth of around 2 to 3 percent, as well as an expansion of 5 to 7 percent in exports as a result of a recovering global economy. The political crisis initially raised fears of a violent response from supporters of Thaksin, who felt disenfranchised after the governments they had elected in the prior five general elections were removed before completing their terms. =Legal sanctions = In 2016, Vivat Yodprasit, better known as the popcorn gunman, was sentenced to 37 years in prison for a murder that was linked to the crisis.

Education and early career  Guppy graduated in Geology from Bedford College, London in around 1925. For the next two years she worked as a research assistant to Prof Leonard Hawkes at Bedford College and published the paper A Composite Dyke from Eastern Iceland in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London. Geological Survey career In 1927 Eileen Guppy was one of two women with geology degrees to be appointed as technical assistants at the Geological Survey of Great Britain. Guppy was appointed to the Petrological Department. She spent many years working in roles subordinate to senior male staff due to her gender and despite her qualifications. By 1935 she was regarded of sufficient status to be given the task of organising the move of the Petrology rock and thin section collections from the old Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street to the new Geological Museum in Exhibition Road (this is now part of the Natural History Museum). Due to World War II in 1943 Guppy was promoted to the rank of assistant geologist, therefore, becoming the first female geology graduate to be appointed to the scientific staff of the Survey. After the war ended, she reverted to her earlier position of Senior Experimental Officer because it was deemed that she had fulfilled her wartime role. She continued to work as a scientific assistant to the survey's Directors Sir William Pugh and Sir James Stubblefield. Guppy later became a secretary for the new Atomic Energy Division, and finally worked with the inspectors from the Public Record Office between 1963 and 1965 evaluating older records from the Geological survey and museum. Upon her retirement in 1966, Guppy was awarded an MBE for her loyal service over 39 years. She was the first female member of staff to be recognized in this way. Even though she had a 43-year career, she was only officially recognized as a geologist for three of them. Most of her contributions to different British Geological Survey publications and reports are rarely credited to her.http://trowelblazers.com/eileen-guppy-the-first-woman-geologist-in-the- british-geological-survey/ Publications Guppy had released her field work in 1924 under the title of A Composite Dyke from Eastern Iceland, which she formed, while partnered with the geologist Leonard Hawkes. She published two editions of Chemical analysis of Igneous Rocks, Metamorphic Rocks and Minerals during 1931 and in 1956. While working for the Director Sir John Flett she made a significant contribution to the book The First Hundred years of the Geological Survey of Great Britain for the British Geological Survey published in 1937. Her work listed the contributing staff on the BGS from 1835-1935. She published a book Rock Wool with James Phemister in 1945 and a second edition came out in 1949. =A Composite Dyke from Eastern Iceland= Guppy, as well as her scientific partner, Leonard Hawkes, composed a case study on the composite dykes of eastern Iceland in the year of 1924. Although Hawkes conducted the field work himself, Guppy played a crucial role in assisting and co-operating with deciphering the commonly occurring composite dykes in the tertiary plateau-basalt series of the respective area studied. The over-ruling findings are as follows: the exposed dyke is seen to be composed of basic and acidic rocks, as well as seven members- the dolerites alternating in the quartz-porphyries. The studied dyke is exposed in cliff-section, which is 2400 feet in vertical height at Hokulvikurgil, Breithdal. Guppy and Hawkes were also able to correctively decipher the sequence of intrusions in the composite dyke. As well, analysis of the origin of quartz and felspar-xenocrysts in the dolerites were made, and in addition, the origins of the basic inclusions in the acidic rocks. Personal life Guppy was unmarried whilst working for the Geological Survey. Up until 1975, when the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 was introduced, female survey staff were required to resign on marriage.

They have continued to participate as art creators after World War II through modern times by either following the traditional way of making art or by departing from such tradition by embracing modernism and other modes of expressing themselves through art. Spanish era (1521–1898) =Sculpting= The first Filipino woman to achieve a level of prominence in the art world, while the Philippines was under the management of Spain, was sculptor Pelagia Mendoza y Gotianquin (1867-1939). The first female student at the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura (Academy of Drawing and Painting), Mendoza studied sculpting under the mentorship of Agustin Saez and Lorenzo Rocha. Her bust of Christopher Columbus won an award during the quattrocentenial celebration of the Discovery of the Americas. =Painting= In the field of painting in the Philippines, the works of art of Carmen Zaragoza y Rojas became notable. Zaragoza was the painter of the masterpiece known as Dos Inteligentias (literally “Two Intellectuals”, 1892), a painting that won Zaragoza a prize during the 1892 anniversary of Christopher Columbus and his discovery of the Americas. Two years later, during the 1895 Exposicion Regional de Filipinas (1895 Regional Exposition in the Philippines), Zaragoza would be awarded a copper medal for creating two landscapes. Other notable Filipino women painters during the time of Zaragoza were Concha Paterno, Adele Paterno, Conception de Montilla, Patricia Reyes, Ana Garcia Plana, Josefa Majo, Concepcion Ortiz, Olimpia Teran de Abella, Rafaella Calanta, and Femina David. Another woman painter who excelled in the field of art in the Philippines was Paz Paterno. Her important painting known as Still Life was decorated with native fruits such as lanzones (Lansium domesticum), bananas, mabolos (velvet apple, Diospyros blancoi), atis (sugar-apple, the fruit of Annona squamosa), balimbings (carambola or starfruit, fruit of Averrhoa carambola), pili nuts, and coconuts. After World War II (1946-present) After World War II, new female artists emerged carrying the modernistic themes in their art. Among these artists were painters such as Anita Magsaysay-Ho, the first Filipino woman abstractionist Nena Saguil, and Philippine Art Gallery owner Lyd Arguilla. During the 1970s and the 1980s, women printmakers and graphic artists began contributing their works of imagery to the Philippine art scene, such as Brenda Fajardo, Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, and Imelda Cajipe-Endaya. This period also saw the emergence of women art collectives in the Philippines such as Kasibulan, for which these artists where members of. Women sculptors like Agnes Arellano, Julie Lluch, Genera Banzon, and Francesca Enriquez also made their noteworthy impressions to the field of sculpting by creating non-traditional statues. Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, a pioneer in the print-making industry, created a notable printed portrait of a widow standing next to the casket of her dead husband. The casket in the image was draped with a Philippine flag, while the widow was standing and holding vigil next to the coffin. Gelvezon-Tequi also produced works made of acrylic-on-paper in 1995. Her masterpieces later focused on portraits of Filipino women such former Philippine President Corazon Aquino, the assassins of her husband Benigno Aquino, Jr., and about plotters of coup d'etats. As a mixed-media artist, Brenda Fajardo used art to describe folk magic and folklore of the Sulod people (part of the Aeta ethnic group) of Panay province. Fajardo is a member of Faculty of Arts at the University of the Philippines in Diliman, Quezon City. She was also the curator of the Vargas Museum of Art located inside the Diliman campus of the University of the Philippines. She was a visiting professor at the St. Norbert College in the United States. On the other hand, Nena Saguil (died in 1994) expressed her artistry through the use of pen and ink to draw abstract images employing dots, bubble, vortices, and rays, including an imagery of an \\"enlarged hymen\\" and \\"a woman cleaning a toilet bowl splattered with human excrement\\". Saguil moved to France to live in Paris. Imelda Cajipe-Endaya ventured in making fragmented artistic scenes by recycling materials found in the household to depict the life and responsibilities of the Filipina domestic helper working in the Philippines and abroad, to integrate their unseen roles as the working wife, mother, and daughter while being miles away from their motherland or from their hometowns in the Philippines. Paulina Constancia is considered one of the most prolific and inspiring female artists in Cebu, Philippines. She is a multifaceted artist best known for her bright colored, whimsical narratives painted on quilts and tiles that are also reflected in her writing. Paulina has exhibited her art in the Philippines, Indonesia, the Netherlands, Mexico & in various cities in the United States & Canada. In 1997, she was presented by the Philippine Centennial Coordinating Council of Northeast USA in a show called \\"Here's to Sunny!\\" at the Philippine Center in New York City. In 2000, her collection of painted quilts called \\"Kleur en ik in de geheime tuin /Hue & I in a Secret Garden\\" was presented by the VHC-Vereniging Haarlemmermeer-Cebu (sister cities organization of Haarlemmermeer and Cebu) at the Centrum voor Kunst en Cultuur in Hoofddrop and Kunst 2001 Gallery in Badhoevedorp. Another noteworthy Filipino woman artist was painter and sculptor Elsie \\"Inday\\" Cadapan whose 1997 sculpture was unveiled for display by former Philippine President Corazon Aquino on October 30, 1997 at the front lobby of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) building. Art as rehabilitation tool On April 21, 2012, the Thomson Reuters Foundation reported that Alma Quinto launched the \\"House of Comfort Art Project\\", a program of the House of Comfort Art Network (ARTHOC), a non-governmental organization that uses art to help sexually abused Filipino women and girls through their rehabilitation. The project employs the use of scrap materials to teach women how to create miniature houses, as a means of expressing their feelings long after the occurrence of abuse and build positive experiences in their minds and to once again become in control of their bodies.

In Peter C. van Welzen's 1992 genus review scientific paper and 1994 Flora Malesiana treatment only L. xylocarpum has the NE. Australia distribution record. the Australian Plant Name Index implies the accepted name of L. xylocarpum for Australian plants and the name L. subdichotomum as misapplied to them, but the Australian Plant Census has not explicitly recorded that current accepted name; the previous current accepted name L. fructoglabrum no longer appears listed. The Queensland Herbarium's 2013 Census of the Queensland Flora, the 2004 Fruits of the Australian Tropical Rainforest major book and the Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants information system (Dec 2010) record L. fructoglabrum as the accepted name.

Pitorro is usually much stronger than commercial rum. At times its alcohol content surpasses the common 80- or 90-proof (40% or 45% alcohol per volume) mark. Some raids have led to confiscation of rum that is up to 80% alcohol per volume (160 proof).

Puerto Rico is known for its production of legal rum, and since it is a major revenue-generating operation, the Puerto Rican police force, as well as agents from the local Departamento de Hacienda (Treasury Department) tend to pursue moonshine producers fervently, particularly around the Christmas season. A town famous (or infamous) for its pitorro production is Añasco, Puerto Rico.

She was a pathologist noted for establishing cancer prevention clinics in New York. She founded two clinics: the Strang Tumor Clinic in 1932 and the Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic in 1937, which operated out of the New York Infirmary. In 1940, L'Esperance opened a second branch of the Strang Cancer Prevention Clinic at the Memorial Center for Cancer and Allied Diseases. During her medical career, L'Esperance published her research prolifically, credited for approximately 30 articles in medical journals. Early life and education Elise L'Esperance was born in Yorktown, New York to Albert Strang, a physician, and Kate Depew Strang. Inspired by her father, she pursued a career in medicine and attended the Woman's Medical College of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, earning her M.D. there in 1900. Interested in pediatrics, L'Esperance spent a year working at Babies Hospital in New York. She then worked for two years at a private pediatric practice in Detroit, Michigan. Career In 1908, she turned to medical research. In 1920, she became professor of pathology at Cornell University Medical College. In 1948–1949, she was president of the American Medical Women's Association. In 1946, she was the first editor of the Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.

A non- profit, non-denominational cemetery established in 1853, the still operational cemetery has a physical footprint of approximately 44 acres and features the attributes typical of the mid-19th century garden cemetery or rural cemetery, including rolling hills, copious trees, curving roads, and an overall asymmetrical design. The cemetery is regulated by the New York State Department of State NYS Division of Cemeteries and as such has the special designation of 501(c)(13) reserved by independent, non-profit cemeteries in New York. It is managed by a volunteer Board of Trustees and funds its operations with a combination of revenues from operations such as burial fees, plot sales income, and marker foundation installation fees, ongoing donations from Cortland Rural Cemetery Foundation, and donations received from individual donors, other foundations, and in-kind assistance from the City of Cortland. Adjacent to the State University of New York at Cortland, located at 110 Tompkins Street, and an included in the Tompkins Street-Main Street Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places, the cemetery has over 19,000 individual graves on its grounds, including those of many notable figures in Cortland's history. The cemetery's grounds also include noteworthy historical architectural structures, including the Gibson Memorial Chapel designed (circa 1922) by noted architect George W. Conable and an office/garage and superintendent's mansion designed by Carl Wesley Clark (circa 1928). The cemetery has dedicated Veterans sections and is also home to a decades-old Jewish Cemetery associated with Cortland's Temple Brith Sholom.

In antiquity, the river formed the border between \\"Rugged Cilicia\\" (Kilikia Tracheia) in the west and \\"Flat Cilicia\\" (Kilikia Pedias) in the east.  Description  Right pilaster with symbols and candelabrum The relief is carved in the living rock at a height of some 1.5 metres above the ground. It has a total height of 1.3 metres. In a niche finished with a conch- shaped top, the image of a woman is found, who can be identified as the goddess Athena thanks to the inscription, among other things. On both sides the niche is formed from blocky pilasters, topped by wide capitals. The goddess is dressed in a peplos, the apoptygma, or upper layer, of which is bound by a girdle at the waist. On the lower part, the robe is tightly fitted to her body, such that her calves are clearly visible underneath. The material covers up her ankles and feet, at the sides of it wrinkle lines go from it to the ground. Inscription The right arm of the figure is raised and holds a lance. Her left, pointing down to the ground, holds a shield on edge. The lance rests on a column, which connects directly to the left pilaster. A snake winds around the lance and column, with its lower end reaching along the ground to Athena's feet. The head and mane of a bridled horse can be seen above the shield and left arm of the goddess and its hindquarters disappear behind her right arm. On the right pilaster there is a star, a crescent moon and a thunderbolt to be seen. Between the moon and the thunderbolt, traces of a servered head can be made out. Similar traces are found to the left of the left pilaster, which is itself undecorated. To the right of the righthand limit of the image, a symbol has been engraved, consisting of a stand with two crescent moons on top and a ball with star. Serra Durugönül, who investigated the Cilician rock reliefs in the 1980s, thought this was a candelabrum, that is a cult object, to be interpreted as a simplified depiction of a Jewish menorah. Between the lance on the left and the female figure an inscription of 13 lines is engraved in a narrow field. In it the goddess is referred to as ΑΘΗΝΑ ΚΡΙΣΟΑ (Athena Krisoa);. The epithet ΚΡΙΣΟΑ, derived from a place name, indicates a local variant of the divinity, but the place connected with the epithet cannot yet be located. It would certainly have been found in the north of Rough Cilica, however. The same epithet shows up in another inscription in the area and in both inscriptions Athena is also referred to as ΟΡΕΙΑ (Oreia, meaning \\"mountaindweller\\")On the cult of Athena Oreia, which is attested only in Cilicia, see Emanuela Borgia: Il culto di Athena Oreia in Cilicia. In: Michel Mazoyer (Hrsg.): La campagne antique: espace sauvage, terre domestiquée. Paris 2003, , S. 73–89.  Interpretation and Dating  The depiction of the goddess corresponds to the Athena Parthenos type, modelled on Phidias' free-standing statue in the Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis. Numerous imitations of this statue were made even in ancient times - another one has also been found in Cilicia. Similarities with Phidias' original include, above all, the clothing, the shield and the column standing on the left. In the original statue, this was a support of the right hand, in which Athena held Nike. Even though this no longer has a function, since this statue is carved in relief and doesn't hold Nike, the artist was unwilling to omit this characteristic attribute. Particularly on account of the type of clam- shell vault of the relief, Durugönül identified two possible dates for the creation of the relief. The first would be the time of the Emperors Claudius and Nero in the 1st century, the second would be the period after Hadrian in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. She inclines to the second, dating the relief to the 2nd century, on the basis of comparison with other rock reliefs of Asia Minor, among which is that of a moongod at Sumatar Harabesi in Osrhoene, which an inscription dates after 165.

Early life and education  Gaskell's mother was an evangelical Christian who brought Anna and her brother along on \\"wild pilgrimages throughout the Midwest,\\" where they would witness miracles being performed, acts of healing, people speaking in tongues, and other Charismatic Christian practices. She claims that she does not remember anything strange about these acts, \\"but more a feeling of excitement and a security in the faith that [she] felt from everyone there.\\" Gaskell says that her work revolves around a similar idea of faith, believing the possibility of the impossible and suspension of disbelief. After studying for two years at Bennington College, she received her BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1992.\\"Gaskell, Anna.\\" Benezit Dictionary of Artists. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 17 Mar. 2014. In 1995, she received her MFA from Yale School of Art, studying under Gregory Crewdson. Career Gaskell stages all of her scenes, using the style of \\"narrative photography,\\" wherein each scene exists only to be photographed. Gaskell pioneers a new discourse of contemporary photography where within each of her series, the narrative of her photographs is disrupted, \\"its fragments functioning like film stills excised from their context but suggesting a missing whole.\\" There are gaps of space and time left between each photograph, evoking a \\"vivid and dreamlike world.\\" In a 2002 interview with curator Matthew Drutt of the Menil Collection, Gaskell describes her creative process and the inspiration she draws from other sources in the following way: \\"The stories and events that I choose to use as jumping-off points are simply that. They are only a part of what goes into the work, and perhaps a useful reference for viewers. [...] Trying to combine fiction, fact, and my own personal mishmash of life into something new is how I make my work. Into all of this, I try to insert a degree of mystery that ensures that the dots may not connect in the same way every time.\\" =1990s= 1996 In haunting photographic scenes of preadolescent girls, Gaskell alludes to well-known children's literature, such as Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which can be found in two of her series: wonder (1996–97) and override (1997). Gaskell made her international debut with the twenty photograph series, wonder (1996–97), the first series Gaskell created after receiving her MFA at Yale University School of Art. wonder, which draws the viewer in with stained-glass coloration intensified by lamination, features two identically dressed Alices photographed together and separately and at oblique angles that recall the disorienting experiences of Alice in Wonderland. For example, in Untitled #1 of wonder, one of the Alices is pictured treading in a pool of her tears, \\"her body grotesquely distorted by the refraction of light on the water\\" and in Untitled #2, one Alice leans over the other, plugging her nose, seemingly about to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. These two photographs also demonstrate how Gaskell takes on the role of \\"unreliable narrator\\" within her series by her \\"use of photography as a format which invites the suspension of disbelief, with her codings and fragmentations of the frames exposing the viewer to the inconsistencies and assumptions that are held in place by realist photographic as well as narrative conventions.” Through the use of different sized photographs, Gaskell displays an instability in Alice by referring to the character's growth spurts and shrinking spells. 1997 In the series override, allusions to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland are made again, as in wonder, but in this series, the scenarios are drawn from Gaskell's own imagination. override features seven versions of Alice which alternate between roles of victim and aggressor. A description about the series written by Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum curators states, \\"[The seven versions of Alice] try to control the changes to her body by literally, physically holding her in place — a potent metaphor for the anxiety and confusion experienced by children on the verge of adolescence.\\" Color and chiaroscuro play a large role in Gaskell's work as they lead the viewer to the main source of action in each piece. While the wonder series features cool blue tones, the photographs featured in override were captured in the \\"golden hues of Twilight.\\" The constantly changing scale of the photographs, the physical stretching and pulling actions performed by the models, and the range of size of the photographs themselves (6 x 7 1/4 inches to 60 x 90 inches) all relate to the central metaphor of Alice in Wonderland: change. Gaskell's film Floater repeats in a backwards sequence a scene of an Ophelia-like young woman in a pool of water, trying to decide whether she should drown or save herself. The theme of this cycle of indecision is seen again in her series half life in 2002. 1998 In her photographic series, hide, Gaskell references a lesser-known Brothers Grimm tale, \\"The Magic Donkey.\\" This series features young girls alone in a gothic mansion, creating a sense of dread and underlying sexual intrigue that takes its impetus from the tale of a young woman forced to hide beneath animal skins to hide from the matrimonial desires of her father.Nancy Spector, \\"The Fiction of Fiction: An Exquisite Unease,\\" in Anna Gaskell (NY: powerHouse Books: 2001) . The name of the series is drawn from the children's game hide-and-seek, the dual personality of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and the literal skin, or hide, that creates a boundary between the inside and the outside, the self and the other. 1999 In 1999, Gaskell produced two series, Sally Salt says and by proxy, both of which featured Sally Salt, the female protagonist in The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, a 1988 British comedy film based on the tall tales told about 18th-century German baron Karl Friedrich Hieronymus von Munchausen. by proxy takes on a darker tone by combining the fictional, gullible, and lovable Sally Salt character with a real-life serial killer, Genene Jones, a pediatric nurse who, in the early 1980s, was found guilty of the murder of several children in Texas. Gaskell's models in by proxy wear white nurse's outfits. The girls in the photographs represent Genene Jones at different stages in her life, battling with her own tormented mind. The title of the series draws from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a type of child abuse in which a caregiver purposefully makes a child under their care ill, usually to attract the attention or sympathy of others upon themselves. Though all of her series are imbued with a sense of darkness, compared to the fictional stories depicted in her previous series such as override and wonder, by proxy is all the more unsettling in that it highlights real-life and disturbing subjects such as Munchausen syndrome by proxy and the Jones murders. =2000s= 2002 Gaskell's half life—drawn from stories such as Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, Elizabeth Gaskell's (no relation) \\"The Old Nurse's Story,\\" and Henry James' The Turn of the Screw—began as an idea for a film installation and evolved into an exhibition combining still and moving images with ten photographs and a film installation. The unnamed central character of Rebecca, a tale from 1938 about an ingénue who goes abroad, marries a middle- aged patrician, and follows him back to his ancestral estate in Cornwall. There the young woman finds the house filled with the memory of the man's dead first wife, Rebecca, which torments the heroine to the brink of suicide. half life draws from the idea of Rebecca's presence in the estate and the heroine's mind. This series explores the human psyche, including the experiences of fear, isolation, and uncertainty. As seen in her previous works, the protagonist of half life is a young woman who finds herself between \\"the purity of youth and the gradual loss of innocence that comes with maturity.\\" Differing itself from previous series, the question of identity is pushed to a new level in half life by the almost total exclusion of the main figure. When shown, the woman often has her back to the camera or remains hidden behind her hair. Gaskell uses dynamic camera angles and elaborately decorated interiors in her photographs in half life creating a sense of vertigo or claustrophobia. The accompanying 21-minute film, similar to her piece, Floater (1997), features a woman floating under water in a state of non-being, neither fully dead or alive. 2007 In her video, Acting Lessons, Gaskell plays the protagonist, an actress who is performing a monologue and is continuously interrupted by an acting coach off screen. In this piece, Gaskell adopts \\"a mundane living room as the setting for her portrayal of emotional power struggles.\\"  Exhibitions  = Solo Exhibitions = 1997 * wonder, Casey Kaplan Gallery, New York 1999 * by proxy, Casey Kaplan Gallery, New York * Sally Salt says…, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne * Hide, White Cube, London * Anna Gaskell, Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami; Museum of Modern Art, Oxford; Astrup Fearnley Museet, Oslo; Hasselblad Center, Gothenburg, Sweden 2000 * by proxy, Aspen Art Museum, Colorado 2001 * Des Moines Art Center, Iowa * Castello di Rivoli, Turin, Italy * Resemblance, Casey Kaplan Gallery, New York * Remarkable Places, Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne * Future's Eve, New Langton Arts, San Francisco 2002 * Half Life, The Menil Collection, Houston; White Cube, London * Addison Gallery of American Art, Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts * Le studio, Yvon Lambert, Paris 2003 * Anagram, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne * How Some Children Play at Slaughtering, Project Room, Chicago 2004 * Casey Kaplan Gallery, New York * At Sixes and Sevens, Yvon Lambert, Paris 2005 * 1991, Galleria Massimo De Carlo, Milan * Erasers, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne 2006 * Everything That Rises, Second Street Gallery, Charlottesville, Virginia 2007 * Paint Your Own Pictures, Yvon Lambert, New York * Still Life, Vizcaya Museum and Garden, Miami * Erasers, The Box, Wexner Center for the Arts, Columbus, Ohio 2009 * Replayground, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne 2010 * Turns Gravity, Yvon Lambert, New York 2013 * Penguin, Yvon Lambert, Paris * The Romantic Exiles, Galerie Gisela Capitain, Cologne 2014 * Vampyr (with Douglas Gordon), Yvon Lambert, Paris = Select Group Exhibitions = 1998 * Sightings, Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London 2002 * Photography Past/Forward.

In Glueck's view, Gaskell's method is \\"to create a narrative expectation without fulfilling it\\", each picture hinting at a situation or story, provoking the viewer to speculate. Glueck does not necessarily approve of this, calling the process of challenging the viewer to make a story \\"do[ing] the artist's work\\". Robert Mahoney, reviewing Gaskell's first exhibition of color photographs in 1997, calls the show a \\"masquerade\\" with a pair of \\"pretty twins\\" playing at Alice in Wonderland in blue pinafores, white tights and \\"black Mary Jane shoes\\". Mahoney calls this an intense search for identity, observing that the use of twins brings out the \\"mirror-like clarity\\" of Alice's dream journey. In his view, the blue and white coloration recalls the Virgin Mary, while the use of young women to represent \\"prepubescent girls\\" brings sexuality into the images. Christopher Mooney, writing for ArtReview in 2014, reviews an exhibition in Paris of Gaskell's photographs alongside her ex-partner Douglas Gordon's \\"wall, floor, and corner works\\". Mooney calls it a swan song, the exhibition featuring swan taxidermy in \\"many\\" of Gordon's works, and a Bolshoi ballet prima ballerina, Svetlana Lunkina, who \\"danc[es] across Gaskell's screens\\". Mooney finds Lunkina the strongest element in the show, Gaskell's photographs displaying her as both graceful and \\"affecting\\".

More recently, Boismard proposed a structurally similar theory, which was further developed by Rolland and Burkett.

This proto-gospel underwent two independent revisions, A and B. Mark was formed by recombining these two revisions. Matthew built upon A and Luke upon B.

The plan has been both hailed and criticized as either the new dawn of education or the beginning of the end of public education in America. History In 2011 the initial school voucher program in Indiana passed while Mitch Daniels was governor. In 2013 the Indiana General Assembly passed HB 1003, which amended the school voucher program by creating tax credits for those already enrolled in private school and expanding voucher eligibility.Mike Pence was governor and supported the changes.http://indianapublicmedia.org/stateimpact/2016/08/19/years-indianas- voucher-program-functions-differently/ Proponents of Vouchers Those who support the voucher program point to the exponential growth of the program.

He served as the Governor of Banská Bystrica Region from 2013 to 2017. He was a presidential candidate in the 2019 election, in which he finished fourth.  Early life and education  Born in Banská Bystrica in what was then Czechoslovakia, Kotleba attended the local Jozef Murgas High School. After finishing the Grammar School he enrolled at the Matej Bel University receiving a Master's Degree in Pedagogics, later he once again enrolled at the Economics faculty at the same university and graduated with a master's degree in Economics. Ater studies he taught at the Sports Grammar School () specialising in sports. https://sk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marian_Kotleba#Vzdelanie_a_za%C4%8Diatky_kari%C3%A9ry  Political views  Banner at the Banská Bystrica administration building put up by Kotleba, ‘Yankees go home! Stop NATO!’ Kotleba supports of Jozef Tiso and the First Slovak Republic, and he is openly against Roma people, Slovak National Uprising, NATO, the United States and the European Union. According to Hospodárske noviny, his position on the Holocaust is unclear. The BBC and The Economist have described him as a neo-Nazi. Kotleba has promoted the Zionist Occupation Government conspiracy theory and described Jews as \\"devils in human skin\\". Kotleba has received a negative reception from the Slovak and foreign media due to his political views. Outlets such as Pravda, Denník SME, and Aktuality have characterized him as \\"extremist\\", \\"fascist\\", and \\"neo-Nazi\\". Kotleba has been charged with demonstrating sympathy for a movement directed at suppression of fundamental rights and freedoms by donating the amount of €1,488 to charity, which is alleged to carry a white supremacist and Neo-Nazi message. On 12 October 2020, a first-degree court found him guilty of a more serious crime than he was charged with (supporting and propagating a movement whose aim is the repression of human rights and freedoms, and doing so publicly). He was sentenced to four years and four months in a lowest-security prison. Kotleba appealed against the verdict.  Political career  In 2003, Kotleba founded the far-right political party Slovak Togetherness (). In 2007 the Slovak interior ministry banned the party from running and campaigning in elections, however it still functioned as a civic organisation. In 2009 he ran for the post of Governor of the Banská Bystrica region and received 10% of the votes. In the 2013 local elections he ran again and this time received approximately 20% of the votes, thereby securing a run-off against favourite Vladimír Maňka. Kotleba won the run-off by receiving 55% of the votes. Kotleba's win was described as a \\"shock\\" by political analysts, who attributed it to deep anti-Romani sentiments in the region. Observers originally had said that they saw almost no chance for Kotleba to succeed in the second round against Maňka, but nonetheless found his strong showing \\"disturbing\\". Prior to the 2016 elections to the National Council, he renamed his party Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko (English: People's Party Our Slovakia) to Kotleba – Ľudová strana Naše Slovensko. Despite the polls suggesting the 1.5–3.5% gain of votes, the party rocketed to the parliament with a gain of over 8% of the vote. Despite elements of Neo-Nazism, the post-electoral polls suggest that his success was a result of dissatisfaction with the running of Slovakia and was seen as a protest vote against the ruling Smer – Sociálna demokracia and the fractured right. It was also linked to the fall of the Christian Democratic Movement, the Christian conservative party, and the European migrant crisis. He was defeated in the Slovak regional elections of 2017 by an independent candidate, Ján Lunter.  International views  = Russia and Syria = Kotleba is known for his sympathy towards Russian Federation and Syrian Arab Republic, having slogans during presidential campaign in 2019 such as \\"For Slavic unity, against war with Russia\\" or declaring on national television that \\"Bashar Al-Assad is a hero of the Middle-East\\". Kotleba also made trips to Syria, having met with Syrian House Speaker and Foreign Minister of Syria. It was revealed upon his departure from Banská Bystrica governorship from the documents found there, that he wanted to send a letter to Russian ambassador, in which he asked for assistance and profoundly wrote about his intention to buy a Russian car. He also spoke critically of American intervention in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yugoslavia, Libya, and Syria, once reading all of United States involvement in regime change in the Slovak Parliament.

Overview During the reign of King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321) the Serbian court hierarchy was: stavilac, čelnik, kaznac, tepčija and vojvoda, the supreme title. In the Dečani chrysobulls, King Stefan Dečanski (r. 1321–1331) mentioned that the court dignitaries present at the Dečani assembly were the kaznac, tepčija, vojvoda, sluga and stavilac. In the periods of the Serbian Kingdom and Serbian Empire, several Byzantine titles and honorifics were adopted, such as sevast, protosevast and sevastokrator. After the crowning of Stefan Dušan as Emperor (1346), there was a further increase in the Byzantinization of the Serbian court, especially in court ceremonies and titles. From his new position, Dušan could grant titles only possible for an emperor to grant, such as despot, sevastokrator, and ćesar.; ; The higher nobility – magnates ( velikaši or velmože) were signified with such titles, along the traditional vojvoda, veliki župan, etc. Titles ;Court titles * župan (жупан). The Serbs in the Early Middle Ages were organized into administrative divisions, župa ( župe), a confederation of village communities (roughly the equivalent of a county), headed by a local župan (a magistrate or governor, župani). According to Fine, the governorship was hereditary, and the župan reported to the Serbian prince, whom they were obliged to aid in war. This title later evolved into veliki župan. * veliki župan (велики жупан). The title signifies overlordship, as the leader of lesser chieftains titled župan. It was originally used by the Serb rulers in the 11th and 12th centuries. Afterwards, it was a high rank with notable holders such as Altoman Vojinović ( 1335–59). * vojvoda (војвода, \\"war-leader\\", belli dux). A senior official, both a military rank (equivalent of general) and gubernatorial title (equivalent of dux, \\"duke\\"), and the highest court title during the time of Stefan Milutin (1282–1321). Later, the title of veliki vojvoda was introduced. * knez (кнез) or knjaz (књаз). Translated as \\"duke\\" or \\"prince\\". * kefalija (кефалија). The earlier župan title was abolished and replaced with the Greek- derived kefalija (kephale, \\"head, master\\") during the reign of Emperor Stefan Dušan. * kaznac (казнац, \\"penalty inflicter\\"). In charge of the treasury in the territory under his jurisdiction, kaznačina, derived from kazna (\\"penalty\\"). It was the equivalent of camerarius (chamberlain). * tepčija (тепчија). * gospodar (господар) or gospodin (господин, \\"lord\\"). * čelnik (челник, \\"head\\"). During the reign of Stefan Milutin (1282–1321), the title holder was entrusted with the security of property belonging to the Church from the aristocrats, so the holder appeared in the role of a judge or executor of the ruler's decisions, in disputes between the church and the nobility. It is unclear if there was one or several with that title at the court at that time. During King Stefan Dečanski's reign (1321–31) there was two or three title holders at the same time. During Stefan Dušan's reign, the title of veliki čelnik (велики челник) is first mentioned. After Jovan Oliver and Dimitrije, it seems that the title was not given at the court of Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–55). * stavilac (ставилац, \\"placer\\"). It was similar to the Byzantine court offices of domestikos and cup-bearer (pinkernes, known in Serbian as peharnik). It had a role in the ceremony at the royal table, though the holder could be entrusted with jobs that had nothing to do with court ritual. According to studies of Rade Mihaljčić, the holder was in charge of acquiring, preparing and serving food at the royal table. It was a confidant duty, given to the highest and most notable nobility, in which the ruler relied on in all occasions. Its oldest mention is from the court of King Stefan Milutin (r. 1282–1321), when Đuraš Vrančić had the title. The title of stavilac ranked as the last in the hierarchy of the Serbian court, behind čelnik, kaznac, tepčija and vojvoda, the supreme title. It was, nevertheless, quite prestigious as it enabled its holder to be very close to the ruler. There is not much information on the title-holders at the court of King Stefan Dečanski, there is however much information on those at the court of King and Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1355). * protovestijar (протовестијар) or veliki kaznac (велики казнац). From Byzantine protovestiarios, minister of finance, holders include Nikola, Petar, Ivan, Marin * despot (деспот). From Byzantine despotes. * kesar (кесар). From Byzantine kaísar (καῖσαρ), in turn derived from Latin caesar, holders include Grgur Golubić, * domestik (доместик). From Byzantine domestikos. Later, the title veliki domestik was introduced. * logotet (логотет). Financial, from Byzantine logothetes. Later, the title veliki logotet was introduced. * čauš (чауш) and veliki čauš (велики чауш). * sluga (слуга). A special court office, similar to stavilac. Later elevated into veliki sluga (велики слуга), an equivalent of megas domestikos. * komornik (коморник) * dijak (дијак) * peharnik (пехарник) ;Honorifics * vitez (витез, \\"knight\\"). The title was held by Palman, a Styrian nobleman that served Stefan Dušan (1331–55) as a bodyguard and mercenary commander, and possibly also Đuraš Ilijić. * sevast (севаст). Honorific. From Byzantine sebastos, meaning \\"venerable\\" (equivalent to Roman augustus). * protosevast (протосеваст). Honorific. From Byzantine protosebastos. Notable holders include Hrelja. * sevastokrator (севастократор). Honorific. From Byzantine sevastokrator.

Teaching  He began his teaching career at the Detroit Institute of Arts, Detroit, Michigan (1955-1956). He was Visiting Professor of Life Drawing at the University of Iowa, Iowa City (1962-1963) and taught at San Francisco State University Art Department (1964-1965). He then taught at the University of Hawaii at Hilo (1965-1967) and University of Hawaii at Manoa School of Art in Honolulu (1966). He occupied the Ames Walker Professorship Chair in the School of Art at the University of Washington, Seattle (1968-1969).  Awards and honors  Thomas received residence fellowships at Yaddo Foundation (1954) and Huntington Hartford Foundation, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California (1957 and 1962), a National Endowment for the Arts grant (1975), and commissions from the Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts and Delta Air Lines.

Significant series of paintings  Thomas often did series of paintings centering on one subject. The first significant series was on the subject of allegorical figures, reaching an early high point with the oil painting \\"Triptych with Predella – the Seasons\\" (1959) (collection of the Orange County Museum of Art), and continuing throughout his life culminating in the oil \\"The Tempest\\" (1997).Jerré Tanner (Fall 2007). On the Origins and Application of the Grid in the Art of John Paul Thomas. UNIversitas, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa; online publication; Volume 3, Issue 1. It included paintings of deities from Hawaiian mythology including Hina (goddess of the moon), Kamapua'a (pig demigod) and the volcano goddess Pele. His \\"Homage to Gaea\\", which occupied the last fifteen years of his life, combined bold color-shapes of tropical foliage with a technique of painting that reflected back to his abstract expressionist youth. His \\"Orchids of Hawaii\\" watercolor series covers the entire time he lived in Kona and resulted in over two hundred paintings of numerous species of orchids, culminating in the triptych \\"Hilo Garden\\", 40 by 54 inches (1987).Hess, Harvey and Thomas, John (1982). Orchid Art and the Orchid Isle. Hoag McGlynn, Betty in Foreword; Malama Arts, Honolulu, Hawaii. His best-known series is \\"Boy with Goldfish\\" comprising seven large oil paintings and smaller oil studies, and a suite of seventeen pencil drawings titled \\"The Battle\\". This series inspired Hawaiian folk singing duo Leon Siu and Malia Elliott to create a series of songs which were later developed into a large concert work for soloists, chorus, orchestra and organ by composer Jerre Tanner. The paintings and drawings were exhibited at The Contemporary Museum [now part of the Honolulu Museum of Art] as part of the Honolulu Symphony Orchestra's premiere of the music in October, 1976.Roster, Laila (1976).

Scholarly studies  Even though Thomas has early roots in Abstract Expressionism, through Baziotes at New York University, critics early on saw him as a maverick, unconcerned with contemporary trends in the arts environment.Wilson, William (11 September 1974). … Hard Italian Sherbet. Los Angeles Times. While his peers were throwing off the trappings of previous conventions, Thomas was developing a system of grids to control the interplay between the two- dimensional surface of a painting and a symbolic third dimension within. He traced the source of the concept to his early studies of Italian Renaissance painters and the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, several of whose students were close personal friends. He named his personal application of the grid to the construction of his painting \\"Symbolic Stereometry\\". All his work from the end of his first year teaching at the University of Hawaii, Hilo Campus (1966) on, come under the influence of the grid. Concurrently, his response to the quality of light in Hawaii and the tropical vegetation resulted in a parallel study of color, particularly the manner in which the eye perceives color in relation to the colors surrounding it. Over forty years’ of studies on these two subjects are housed at Rod Library Special Collections, University of Northern Iowa, Cedar Falls, Iowa.

In some European cultures it was customary to place the dried or desiccated body of a cat inside the walls of a newly built home to ward off evil spirits or as a good luck charm. It was believed that the cats had a sixth sense and that putting a cat in the wall was a blood sacrifice so the animal could use psychic abilities to find and ward off unwanted spirits. Although some accounts claim the cats were walled in alive, examination of recovered specimens indicates post-mortem concealment in most cases. Origins In the British Isles, as well as in northern Europe and North America, the dried or mummified bodies of cats are frequently found concealed within structures and are believed to have been placed there to bring good luck or to protect the building and its occupants from harm. The North American instances are strongly associated with European households and are most often found in buildings where shoes and witch bottles are also concealed. In some cases, the animals are found deliberately posed as if in the midst of attack. In other cases, they are accompanied by dried rats, mice, or birds. Historian Ian Evans stated in an interview that this was part of a secret folk magic practice that may have come from the Romans to the British and then to Australia as well. Evans has also launched the Tasmanian Magic Project in an effort to understand the history of this practice in Australia. Sometimes when the animals are discovered, as in the case of a mummified cat and kittens, it might be assumed that the animal was just accidentally there and got stuck. However, there are times when the animals are found in locations that it would have been impossible for them to have gotten into accidentally such as being encased in a brick cavity. Mummification of cats in ancient Egypt Cats in ancient Egypt were represented in social and religious practices of Ancient Egypt for more than 30 centuries. Several Ancient Egyptian deities were depicted and sculptured with cat-like heads such as Mafdet, Bastet and Sekhmet, representing justice, fertility and power. The deity Mut was also depicted as a cat and in the company of a cat. Cats were praised for killing venomous snakes and protecting the Pharaoh since at least the First Dynasty of Egypt. Skeletal remains of cats were found among funerary goods dating to the 12th Dynasty. The protective function of cats is indicated in the Book of the Dead, where a cat represents Ra and the benefits of the sun for life on Earth. Cat- shaped decorations used during the New Kingdom of Egypt indicate that the cat cult became more popular in daily life. Cats were depicted in association with the name of Bastet. Cat cemeteries at the archaeological sites Speos Artemidos, Bubastis and Saqqara were used for several centuries. They contained vast numbers of cat mummies and cat statues that are exhibited in museum collections worldwide. Among the mummified animals excavated in Gizeh, the African wildcat (Felis lybica) is the most common cat followed by the jungle cat (Felis chaus). In view of the huge number of cat mummies found in Egypt, the cat cult was certainly important for the country's economy, as it required breeding of cats and a trading network for the supply of food, oils and resins for embalming them.

History Stemco was founded on March 1, 1951, by Ben Cook and Tom Davidson in St. Charles, Missouri, and originally manufactured mufflers and oil reservoirs for commercial trucks. The company moved to Longview, Texas, in 1958 to expand the company and began manufacturing new truck parts, including dual wheel adapters, hub hose carriers, drum check gauges and exhaust accessories. This move led to an increase in production and employee growth. In 1964, Stemco was purchased by Garlock Inc, an industrial sealing company. In the following decades, Stemco began designing and manufacturing new products for use in the commercial trucking industry, such as hub oil seals, hubodometers and other products which have become standard additions to OEM truck component manufacturers. In 2007, Stemco began acquiring and partnering with other trucking equipment manufacturers. Stemco acquired V.W.

The film gained notoriety in America for having scenes of nudity cut in various states. Markey directed and produced the film, also writing the screenplay and the \\"native melodies\\". His girlfriend Zoe Varney was credited as associate producer. Alfred Hill, the original composer, and Ted Coubray, the original cameraman, were both fired and not credited; Coubray also lost his camera to Markey. The film also used unpaid Māori extras, and taonga, their cherished tribal artefacts, were lent by the cast; Markey took the artefacts when he returned to America, leaving unpaid bills behind him. Local investors had invested £10,000 in the film. The film was shot in Waihi. The film was released in America with sound added; a symphonic score by Oscar Potoker was added using the RCA Photophone System and \\"voice-over\\" narration, which avoided the problems of synchronisation. It is one of four films (with The Devil's Pit, Down on the Farm, and On the Friendly Road) which claim to be the first \\"New Zealand talkie\\", although the claim is dubious in this case as the sound was added in America.

The 1800s factory was in continuous operation until 2003. Factory History The factory resided at 201 River Road in Catonsville, Maryland, on 106 acres of land in both Baltimore County and Howard County along the Patapsco river on River road. The site was known as the \\"Thistle Factory\\" or \\"Thistle Cotton Mill\\". Alexander Fridge, George and William Morris founded the Thistle Manufacturing Company in 1824 with the purchase of the property from the Ellicott brothers. The Ellicotts stipulated that the new factory as well as the Dismal Mill downstream would not operate as a competing flour mill, and in turn, the Ellicott's could not sell liquor on their land, Ellicott's Mills. In 1825 Fridge had sold his assets and the Morris brothers petitioned to build a road from the Thistle factory to the turnpike followed in 1832 with a state appropriation of $600 to build a bridge across the Patapsco at Thistle Mills. In 1837 they built a cotton mill and silk production facility on property purchased from the Ellicott brothers. The 100 employee mill building was built of locally quarried stone along with at least five stone buildings to support laborers and a general store. The company expanded production with the purchase of the Ilchester flour mill in 1882, but lost the facility in receivership in 1892. In 1895, the current owner and operator of the mill W.H. Kerr drowned when attempting to rescue his son who fell off his yacht in Annapolis. In 1919 Edward A.A. Blakeney purchased the plant for cotton duck production, and electrified operations in 1925, but shifted to tire fabric manufacturing. In 1928 The Bartgis Brothers Company purchased the factory and refitted it through August 1929 for paper production. Bartigis was purchased by E.H. Lupton, and was sold to the New Haven Board and Carton Co. in July 1957 and later, Simkins Industries, Inc. The 250 employee factory produced recycled paper products with printing operations from 1919 to 1964. Most of 1964 operations were interrupted by a labor strike. In 1952, a dump was created on the steep slopes that was in operation until the mid-1980s. In 1971 sewer service was added, stopping direct drainage of titanium dioxide into the Patapsco river. In 1972, the factory was devastated by Hurricane Agnes and then again by a four-alarm fire just four months later, though did recover back into operations within the ruins. The last factory configuration included the mill, powerplant, scalehouse, and a dump. A historic mill village is on the wooded site. Modern developments In 1991, Thistle was the last remaining company town in Baltimore County, with 110 remaining workers at the Simkins Industries Inc. paper mill that processed recycled wastepaper into box board. On the site were the remains of what might have been the village's church and school, with a graveyard above the ridge, though many other buildings and the company houses for employees on Hilltop Road had been destroyed by flooding or demolished over the years. In June 2003, a four alarm fire broke out and forced the facility to close after 46 years of operation as a paper recycling plant. In August 2003, a complaint was filed against the facility for violations in hazardous materials and solid waste dumping. The company entered a voluntary cleanup program with the Maryland Department of the Environment. It then started dismantling the historic mill town buildings and industrial tanks. The building was burned again in 2009 and December 2011. Simkins Industries announced in 2012 that it would sell the historic factory and 55 acres of property to a land developer or the State of Maryland. The complex was demolished in 2013. The Simkins plant was one of many historical buildings in the region with valuable real estate that was lost to arson, including Troy Hill (1990), Avondale Mill (1991), St. Mary's College (directly across the river from the Thistle plant (1997), and Ammendale Normal Institute (1998), and Henryton State Hospital (2007).

The generator could be in the form of a computer program, a chart with multiple columns, a book composed of panels that flip independently of one another, or a set of several adjacent reels that spin independently of one another, allowing a user to select elements of a narrative plot. The tool may allow the user to select elements for the narrative, or it may combine them randomly, a specific variation known as a random plot generator. Such tools can be created for virtually any genre, although they tend to produce formulaic and hackneyed situations.  History  Plot generators were described as early as the late 1920s, with Plotto; a new method of plot suggestion for writers of creative fiction, by William Wallace Cook, appearing in 1928. Plotto is a non-random plot generator; the reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.Eger, Markus, Colin M. Potts, Camille Barot, and R. Michael Young. 2015. “Plotter: Operationalizing the Master Book of All Plots.” In Eleventh Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference, 30–33. Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, Robert J. Hogan described a book-based device called the Plot Genie which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices such as The 36 Dramatic Situations and Plotto (see above). The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an artificial intelligence program developed in the 1970s. More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the Mexica people. Using an approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to Russian folklore. There are a large number of \\"random plot generators\\" available on the internet—generic and relating to specific fandoms, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject. Plot generators have also been portrayed in fiction, as in Fritz Leiber's The Silver Egghead.  Story generator algorithm  The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.

Initial field observations indicate it is a subsocial spider. It lives in low elevation environments, including beachfront mangrove forests. It was identified by Ingi Agnarsson in 2012, who named the species after Terry Pratchett, whom Agnarsson described as \\"a comic genius.\\"  Description  The total length of the spider is approximately , with females slightly larger than the males. The coloration pattern is similar to others in its genus: the prosoma is light yellow with grey lines, while the abdomen is lighter in color with spots clustering off the midline. Its primary diagnostic characteristic is the shape of the genitals. In males, the embolus is corkscrew-shaped. A similar shape is found in Anelosimus luckyi, although the embolus is longer in A. pratchetti. The female can be distinguished from others in the genus by the shape of the copulatory ducts and a unique triangular epigynal plate.  Distribution and genetics  The holotype specimen was collected from Berowra Valley Regional Park, at an elevation of approximately . Additional specimens have been collected from Toolijooa at elevations of approximately . The species has only been found in Australia. The holotype and several paratypes were curated by the National Museum of Natural History. The species uniqueness and placement in the genus has been confirmed by analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a closer link between Anelosimus pratchetti and two Madagascar species, Anelosimus sallee and Anelosimus may, than several geographically closer species within the same genus. The species on Madagascar have previously been identified as arriving in multiple migration events. The finding further illustrates the complexity of migration within the genus.  Sociality  Spiders within the genus Anelosimus have been studied due to their social structure. Most of the species within the genus are social or subsocial, with solitary species in the genus occurring within a single clade. Not all species within the clade are solitary, however, indicating a reversal within the clade. Two species closely related to A. pratchetti, A. may and A. sallee, have both been identified as subsocial. Preliminary observations on A. pratchetti indicate it is subsocial as well.

He wrote the national anthem of Afghanistan. Early life and education Jahani was born in Ahmad Shahyee area of Kandahar city, in southern Afghanistan. Jahani often recalls his old good days of childhood in Kandahar where he spent most of his teenage years and talks about how Kandahar was once a melting pot and a common home for all ideologies and beliefs. In his Raazo-Niyaaz book Jahani talks about how he grew up playing in Kandahar as a kid and how peaceful Kandahar was during his high school time. Jahani is from the Lodin tribe, a sub-tribe of Ghilzai, one of the two main tribes of Pashtuns. He considers the ethnic diversity of Afghanistan, with its various tribes and ethnic groups, as constituting the country's strength, and thinks that Afghans have shown throughout the history of their country that they are united and one hand. Their unity is better portrayed when they face an outside threat as a nation or when their country is celebrating a national victory. Jahani completed his primary, secondary and high school in Mirwais Nika high school of Kandahar city--- a well -known public school in the south. Kandahar University was not yet built when Jahani finished his high school. Upon completing his high school at Mirwais Nika, Jahani only had two options for his higher education. He could either move to Kabul to study what he wanted to study which was history and literature or move to Nangarhar province—home to the second Afghan university at the time in the country. He chose the former one because unlike Kabul University where students had the option to pursue various majors, Nangarhar University only offered education in the field of medicine. Jahani graduated from Kabul University in 1972 with a BA in Pashto literature and history. Upon his graduation from Kabul University, Jahani joined the Pashto Tolana which is a very prestigious literature body in Afghanistan whose members have been prominent Afghan philosophers, historians, poets and writers. Getting into Pashto Tolana is the equivalent of getting into Harvard Law Review if someone was pursuing legal education in the U.S. Pashto Tolana approves the entrance of new terminologies into Pashto language and is tasked to develop Pashto language to be richer in terms of new vocabulary. Jahani had tremendous contribution to the development of Pashto language while at Pashto Tolana Career Jahani has just been given parliamentary vote of approval to serve as a minister in the cabinet of Afghan unity government 2015 for the ministry of information and culture. Besides being a member of the Pashto Tolana (Pashto Society), Jahani served as the Managing-Editor of a well-known Afghan magazine, Kabul Magazine. Under his leadership, Kabul Magazine witnessed considerable increase in its readership. In his capacity as the Managing Editor of the Magazine, Jahani oversaw the flow of hundreds of informative and educative social, economic and political articles aimed at keeping the Afghan public aware of the state of affairs of their country. Subsequently, Jahani served in the Afghan Ministry of Education (MoE) for two years before he was forced to leave the country during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Jahani's mission from the very beginning was to inspire Afghan society to walk towards knowledge and education and for that noble goal he join the Afghan government's education sector. Communists and leftists feared voices of prominent figures like Jahani and began a government planned campaign against influential and intellectual figures. Jahani migrated to Pakistan as a refugee and after two years of living as a refugee there, Jahani was offered a job with the Voice of America in Washington DC. Jahani accepted the offer and joined the Voice of America's Pashto service in 1983 as an International broadcaster. He has contributed extensively to Pashto language programing of the Radio. Jahani hosted political talk shows, news hour shows and poetry shows at the Voice of America. His poetry show of late 11PM called “Da Ashnayaano Adabi dera” had listeners in the entire South Asian region and the Middle East. His poetry show had listeners from different age groups including youths and elders. One of his most famous poem which had a huge demand and continues to have, was the story of “three cows and one wolf” that was written in the language of poetry. The moral of the poem is unity. Like most of his other poetry, in his “three cow one wolf” poem Jahani speaks to his audiences in a plain, natural and understandable language. He warns them of what is at stake if Afghans remain divided and what could be achieved if Afghans leave behind their differences and get united behind a common goal of building a prosperous, stable and peaceful Afghanistan. Jahani continued to use his able mind and pen and VOA provided him the platform to convey his message of enlightenment to various parts of Afghanistan. With Jahani's contribution and dedication to excellence and his prominence and popularity amongst Afghans, VOA's Pashto service ratings and listeners have soared. Jahani's career as a journalist with the Voice of America has earned him several recognitions and medals from the leadership of the Voice of America. He retired from the Voice of America in 2010, but never ceased to end his advocacy for Afghan unity, Afghan education and Afghan prosperity. He regularly gets offers to speak at various Afghan events held in Afghanistan, Middle East, Europe and the United States and regularly gets interview request by various Afghan TV and Radio stations in Afghanistan and around the world. Not only that Jahani's articles about social, political and economic situation of Afghanistan are well received by various public and private print and online media outlets in Afghanistan and around the world. Jahani regularly visits Afghanistan and speak at various events including seminars discussing Pashto literature and education. =Refugee status and its impact on Jahani’s poetry= Jahani often refers to the hardships of leaving behind the place where he was born and learned how to walk. His obsession with his homeland, Afghanistan and his constant commendation of all parts of Afghanistan in his poetry has earned him a special place in the hearts of all Afghans from all walks of life and from all ethnic groups. Through his poetry, he commends the beautiful rivers, mountains, ranches and deserts of Afghanistan and how expresses pride in them. In his Wraka Mena ( lost home) poetry collection, Jahani expresses his deep love and compassion for his homeland Afghanistan. The title of the book means lost homeland. In Jahani's words this book is dedicated to those who have been convicted by fate, whose mouths have been forcibly shut by the unjust rulers and whose pens have been limited by the people of the time. =Pashto literature= Jahani is a prominent Pashtun poet of the 21st century. He is considered to be the contemporary Rahman Baba and Khushal Khan Khattak who are two prominent Afghan warrior poets of the 17th century. Jahani's poetry has various themes including epic, romance, patriotism, bravery and a message of enlightenment. He has published dozens of books in poetry and has translated several Persian poetry books from Persian into Pashto in the language of poetry which is a difficult task to undertake. Besides that Jahani has translated several English books into Pashto. His main poetry books include: *The Moshko Karwaan (د مشکو کاروان) *Wraka Mayna (ورکه مېنه) *Razo-Niyaaz (رازو نیاز) *Da Sabawoon Pa tama (د سباوون په تمه) *Shpelai (شپېلۍ) *Paikob (پایکوب) *Koi toor (کوه طور) *Kawsar (کوثر) Jahani's novels and history books include: *Da Pashto pa soor aw taal ki da gharbee sandaro shrang ( د پښتو په سور او تال کي د غربي سندرو شړنګ) *Herat, Pashtana aw Stara Loba ( هرات، پښتانه، ستره لوبه) *Da Khiyam Robayat da Pashto Pa Taal ki ( د خیام ربایات د پښتو په تال کي) =National anthem and Constitution= Jahani is considered the most prominent Pashtun poet of the contemporary era. Because of his prominence in Pashto literature and poetry, he was officially requested by the President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai to write the Afghan national anthem in 2006. Prior to that, Jahani also advised the Afghan commission tasked with writing the new constitution in 2004. Jahani's lyrics were adopted as the national anthem (Pashto: ملي سرود - Milli Surood; Dari: سرود ملی - \\"Surud-e Milli\\") and officially announced at a meeting of the Loya Jirga in May 2006. The English translation and the Pashto transliteration of the Afghan National Anthem are as follows: = Other translations = His poem Wyaar (Pride) has been translated into English by Dawood Azami and the Poetry Translation Centre. =Popular support and politics= Jahani is considered a very influential person in Afghanistan and politicians often rely on his influence over all Afghans particularly Pashtuns in the South and East of the country. Presidential hopefuls during both 2005 and 2009 elections have tried to get Jahani to back their bids for presidency to attract more voters from the south and the east of Afghanistan. Jahani is believed to be in favor of politicians who work for all Afghans regardless of their ethnicity and political affiliations. Jahani believes in a united Afghanistan and often backed leaders who represent all Afghans from all ethnic groups. Jahani backed Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai in the 2009 Afghan presidential elections; Ashraf Ghani became the president of Afghanistan in the April 2014 presidential elections. Jahani was supported by a large number of Afghans, particularly youths to run for president himself in the 2014 elections, but he chose not to and his favorite candidate for the presidency is yet to be determined. Whomever Jahani sides with will have a better chance of victory in the southern region of Afghanistan. If one person could unite Pashtuns of the south in the contemporary era, it will be Jahani because there is a lot respect in Afghanistan particularly in the south for his sense of patriotism, his pride in Afghan history and his intellectual abilities. Jahani is a strong critic and opponent of corruption in Afghanistan and his intellectual crusade against the rampant corruption of the Afghan government has impacted his relationships with President Karzai who has a long-standing friendship with Jahani. Their friendship witnessed further rift when Jahani backed the bid of Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai for president in the 2009 elections of Afghanistan in which Hamid Karzai won a second term in office. Criticism Jahani is criticized by some for basing some of his poetry on an epic theme which according to critics invites people to war and violence, but his proponents not only defend his epic poetry and his efforts to depict Afghan history in the language of poems, but also claim that Jahani's poetry invites Afghans to unity, solidarity, peace, education and progress. His recent poem that sparked a national debate amongst scholars about what role intellectuals could play in conflict resolution efforts was about a suicide bomber and his mother in which he depicted good through the role of a desperate mother and bad through the role of a brainwashed son who wanted to carry out a suicide attack for a quest to earn heaven and salvation. Some critics viewed the poem as recognition of suicide attacks as a legit and glorifying act while others viewed the poem as informative and educative for those people who fall victims of terrorists and extremists. The poem lets mother mercy and humanity win over the hatred, violence and evil of the to-be suicide bomber son. The poem is written in a dialogue form between a mother and a son. The poem is set to music by Afghan singer Bashir Maidani with the title \\"Nasihat\\" available on YouTube and Maidani's 2011 album Afsoz; the song is very popular amongst Pashtoons in the world because of Jahani's excellent poetry. Singers Jahani's poems have been picked by well-known Afghan singers such as Dr. Fetrat Nashnas, Farhaad Darya, Waheed Qasemi, Waheed Saberi, Bashir Maidani and other Afghan singers.

The novel won the Jomo Kenyatta Prize for Literature in 1974. Plot The story follows Meja and Maina, two young boys who move to the city after obtaining their secondary school diplomas. They hope to find jobs in order to support their families back home. Initially unsuccessful, the pair live in dumpsters, eating rotten fruit and stale cakes, unable to return home as failures. Eventually, they obtain jobs at a farm working for a very rich family. Maina causes problems in the house while blaming Meja, who suffers the consequences. Meja is put on half rations, moved from job to job, then has his rations almost completely revoked. After Maina's biggest episode, the pair lose their jobs. Mania and Meja split after Mania steals from a store and gets Meja in trouble. Meja flees home only to return to the city and work in a coal mine. Maina joins a gang in \\"shanty land,\\" led by a boy named Razor who claims they went to school together. Here, Maina attempts to run a scheme selling milk to clients in the area, which he has stolen from the rich neighborhood. Eventually, he is caught. The pair meet up again in prison, but soon go their separate ways. Meja continues to go in and out of prison, and Maina ends up on trial for murder. Themes Treatment of women Like many other postcolonial Kenyan novels, women are depicted as objects for sexual pleasure, or as Nici Nelson puts it, only there as \\"screws for the main characters.\\" Sara, Razor's girlfriend, is there for the sole purpose of allowing him to obtain pleasure in front of his gang. Maina's girlfriend Dehliah is mentioned briefly, and she works as a \\"barmaid,\\" also known as a prostitute. Disillusionment with Independence Ayo Kenhinde remarks that Kill Me Quick' \\"presents a harsh account of urban life in postcolonial Kenya.\\" The novel opens with the lines: :Meja sat by the ditch swinging his legs this way and that. A few people passed by engrossed in their daily problems and none of them gave the lanky youth a thought. But the searching eyes of Meja missed nothing. They scrutinized the ragged beggars who floated ghostly past him as closely as they watched the smart pot-bellied executives wrinkling their noses at the foul stench of backyards. And between these two types of beings, Meja made comparison...\\" Kenhinde remarks that this is what Mwangi sees every day, and that \\"he has a vision of life as hell.\\" Meja illustrates how what he sees is so much less than what he was anticipating, which is a general discourse among the genre. Arlene Elder echoes this idea of disillusionment, coining what she terms the 'pursuit of the Kenyan Dream.\\" Within the novel, the protagonists are \\"Frustrated again and again by a hypocritical society that pays lip service to the value of formal education, but fails to reward those who believe it promises.\\" Like the American Dream, the Kenyan Dream is unable to be achieved, and Meja and Mania are left to suffer. Urban Geography Sarah Smiley uses Kill Me Quick and the rest of Mwangi's \\"urban novels\\" to illustrate the pitfalls of the urban centers. Smiley uses them as a teaching tool for students, believing that these fictional accounts are accurate representations of real urban experiences. Passages are selected and used to create a geography for a Kenyan urban center, which is then used to teach students the similarities between other cities. The novel's urban landscape serves to highlight the corruption and crime of the plot, but it is also a place where people live and move about in their daily lives, a concept few scholars address.

He undertook work for Venetian churches such as San Pantalon and San Martino. The San Clemente Church on the Isola di San Clemente has one of his paintings.

It is typically the primary murti or devotional image in Hindu temples dedicated to Shiva, also found in smaller shrines, or as self-manifested natural objects. The lingam is often represented within a disc-shaped platform. Lingayats wear a lingam inside a necklace, called Ishtalinga. \\"Lingam\\" is additionally found in Sanskrit texts with the meaning of \\"evidence, proof\\" of God and God's existence. Lingam iconography found at archaeological sites of the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia includes simple cylinders set inside a yoni, mukhalinga rounded pillars with carvings such as of one or more mukha (faces), and anatomically realistic representations of a phallus such as at Gudimallam. In the Shaiva traditions, the lingam is regarded as a form of spiritual iconography.  Nomenclature and significance Lingam as interpreted in Shaiva Siddhanta tradition which is a major school of Shaivism. Upper and lower part represents Parashiva and Parashakti perfections of Lord Shiva. Lingam, states Monier Monier-Williams, appears in the Upanishads and epic literature, where it means a \\"mark, sign, emblem, characteristic\\".Linga, Monier Monier-Williams, Harvard University Archives, pp. 901-902 Other contextual meanings of the term include \\"evidence, proof, symptom\\" of God and God's power. The term also appears in early Indian texts on logic, where an inference is based on a sign (linga), such as \\"if there is smoke, there is fire\\" where the linga is the smoke. It is a religious symbol in Hinduism representing Shiva as the generative power, all of existence, all creativity and fertility at every cosmic level. The lingam of the Shaivism tradition is a short cylindrical pillar-like symbol of Shiva, made of stone, metal, gem, wood, clay or disposable material. According to Encyclopædia Britannica, the lingam is a votary aniconic object found in the sanctum of Shiva temples and private shrines that symbolizes Shiva and is \\"revered as an emblem of generative power\\". It often is found within a lipped, disked structure that is an emblem of goddess Shakti and this is called the yoni. Together they symbolize the union of the feminine and the masculine principles, and \\"the totality of all existence\\", states Encyclopædia Britannica. According to Wendy Doniger, for many Hindus, the lingam is not a \\"male sexual organ\\" but of a spiritual icon and their faith, just like for the Christians the cross is not an \\"instrument of execution\\" but a symbol of Christ and the Christian faith. According to Alex Wayman, given the Shaiva philosophical texts and spiritual interpretations, various works on Shaivism by some Indian authors \\"deny that the linga is a phallus\\"., Quote: \\"That is why today one will read in various works by Indian on Saivism a denial that the linga is a phallus; and the late Dr. Basham once told the present writer that in all the years of his India contacts he never found any Saivite admitting that the linga is a phallus.\\" To the Shaivites, a linga is neither a phallus nor do they practice the worship of erotic penis-vulva, rather the linga-yoni is a symbol of cosmic mysteries, the creative powers and the metaphor for the spiritual truths of their faith. According to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, the lingam signifies three perfections of Shiva. The upper oval part of the Shivalingam represent Parashiva and lower part of the Shivalingam called the pitha represents Parashakti. In Parashiva perfection, Shiva is the absolute reality, the timeless, formless and spaceless. In Parashakti perfection, Shiva is all-pervasive, pure consciousness, power and primal substance of all that exists and it has form unlike Parashiva which is formless. According to Rohit Dasgupta, the lingam symbolizes Shiva in Hinduism, and it is also a phallic symbol. Since the 19th- century, states Dasgupta, the popular literature has represented the lingam as the male sex organ. This view contrasts with the traditional abstract values they represent in Shaivism wherein the lingam-yoni connote the masculine and feminine principles in the entirety of creation and all existence. History According to Nagendra Singh, some believe linga-worship was a feature of indigenous Indian religion. = Archaeology and Indus valley= According to Chakrabarti, \\"some of the stones found in Mohenjodaro are unmistakably phallic stones\\". These are dated to some time before 2300 BCE. Similarly, states Chakrabarti, the Kalibangan site of Harappa has a small terracotta representation that \\"would undoubtedly be considered the replica of a modern Shivlinga [a tubular stone].\\" According to Encyclopædia Britannica, while Harappan discoveries include \\"short cylindrical pillars with rounded tops\\", there is no evidence that the people of Indus Valley Civilization worshipped these artifacts as lingams. A Buddhist Stupa (above) may have influenced the later iconography of the Hindu Shiva-linga, according to Swami Vivekananda. The colonial era archaeologists John Marshall and Ernest Mackay proposed that certain artifacts found at Harappan sites may be evidence of yoni-linga worship in Indus Valley Civilization. Scholars such as Arthur Llewellyn Basham dispute whether such artifacts discovered at the archaeological sites of Indus Valley sites are yoni., Quote: \\"It has been suggested that certain large ring- shaped stones are formalized representations of the female regenerative organ and were symbols of the Mother Goddess, but this is most doubtful.\\" For example, Jones and Ryan state that lingam/yoni shapes have been recovered from the archaeological sites at Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, part of the Indus Valley Civilisation. In contrast, Indologist Wendy Doniger states that this relatively rare artifact can be interpreted in many ways and has unduly been used for wild speculations such as being a linga. Another postage stamp sized item found and called the Pashupati seal, states Doniger, has an image with a general resemblance with Shiva and \\"the Indus people may well have created the symbolism of the divine phallus\\", but given the available evidence we cannot be certain, nor do we know that it had the same meaning as some currently project them to might have meant. According to the Indologist Asko Parpola, \\"it is true that Marshall's and Mackay's hypotheses of linga and yoni worship by the Harappans has rested on rather slender grounds, and that for instance the interpretation of the so-called ring-stones as yonis seems untenable\\". He quotes Dales 1984 paper, which states \\"with the single exception of the unidentified photography of a realistic phallic object in Marshall's report, there is no archaeological evidence to support claims of special sexually- oriented aspects of Harappan religion\\". However, adds Parpola, a re- examination at Indus Valley sites suggest that the Mackay's hypothesis cannot be ruled out because erotic and sexual scenes such as ithyphallic males, naked females, a human couple having intercourse and trefoil imprints have now been identified at the Harappan sites. The \\"finely polished circular stand\\" found by Mackay may be yoni although it was found without the linga. The absence of linga, states Parpola, maybe because it was made from wood which did not survive. =Vedic literature= The word lingam is not found in the Rigveda, or the other Vedas. However, Rudra (proto-Shiva) is found in the Vedic literature. The word lingam appears in early Upanishads, but the context suggests that it simply means \\"sign\\" such as \\"smoke is a sign of fire\\", states Doniger. There is a hymn in the Atharvaveda that praises a pillar (Sanskrit: stambha), and this is one possible origin of linga worship. According to Swami Vivekananda, the Shiva-linga had origins in the idea of Yupa-Stambha or Skambha of the Vedic rituals, where the term meant the sacrificial post which was then idealized as the eternal Brahman. The Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga, quite possibly with influence from Buddhism's stupa shaped like the top of a stone linga, according to Vivekananda. =Early iconography and temples= Gudimallam lingam (Parashurameshwara temple, Andhra Pradesh) has been dated to between the 3rd and 1st century BCE. The phallic pillar is anatomically accurate and depicts Shiva with an antelope and axe in his hands standing over a dwarf demon. One of the oldest examples of a lingam is still in worship in the Parashurameshwara temple, Gudimallam, in a hilly forest about east of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. It has been dated to the 3rd-century BCE, or to the 2ndcentury BCE, and is mostly accepted to be from the 3rd- to 1st-century BCE, though some later dates have been proposed. The stone lingam is clearly a detailed representation of an erect phallus, with a figure of Shiva carved on the front, holding an antelope and axe in his hands. He stands on top of a rakshasha (demon) dwarf. The Bhita linga – now at the Lucknow museum – is also dated to about the 2nd century BCE, and has four directional faces on the pillar and a Brahmi script inscription at the bottom. Above the four faces, the Bhita linga has the bust of a male with his left hand holding a vase and the right hand in the abhaya (no-fear) mudra. The pillar itself is, once again, a realistic depiction of human phallus. Angkor period. Discovered in Battambang Province (Cambodia) and is made of Bronze, Quartz and Silver. On display at the National Museum of Cambodia. The Mathura archaeological site has revealed similar lingams with a standing Shiva in front (2nd century CE) and with one or four faces around the pillar (1st to 3rd century CE). Numerous stone and cave temples from the mid to late 1st-millennium feature lingams. The Bhumara Temple near Satna Madhya Pradesh, for example, is generally dated to late 5th-century Gupta Empire era, and it features an Ekamukha Lingam. =Mahabharata= According to Doniger, the Mahabharata is the first ancient Hindu text where the lingam is \\"unequivocally designating the sexual organ of Shiva\\". Chapter 10.17 of the Mahabharata also refers to the word sthanu in the sense of an \\"inanimate pillar\\" as well as a \\"name of Shiva, signifying the immobile, ascetic, sexualized form of the lingam\\", as it recites the legend involving Shiva, Brahma and Prajapati. This mythology weaves two polarities, one where the lingam represents the potentially procreative phallus (fertile lingam) and its opposite \\"a pillar-like renouncer of sexuality\\" (ascetic lingam), states Doniger. =Puranas= The Shiva Purana describes the origin of the lingam, known as Shiva-linga, as the beginning-less and endless cosmic pillar (Stambha) of fire, the cause of all causes. Lord Shiva is pictured as emerging from the lingamthe cosmic pillar of fireproving his superiority over the gods Brahma and Vishnu. This is known as Lingodbhava. The Linga Purana also supports this interpretation of lingam as a cosmic pillar, symbolizing the infinite nature of Shiva. According to the Linga Purana, the lingam is a complete symbolic representation of the formless Universe Bearerthe oval- shaped stone is the symbol of the Universe, and the bottom base represents the Supreme Power that holds the entire Universe in it. A similar interpretation is also found in the Skanda Purana: \\"The endless sky (that great void which contains the entire universe) is the Linga, the Earth is its base. At the end of time the entire universe and all the Gods finally merge in the Linga itself.\\" In the Linga Purana, an Atharvaveda hymn is expanded with stories about the great Stambha and the supreme nature of Mahâdeva (the Great God, Shiva). =Other literature= A linga-yoni in Nepal carved with four seated Buddhas. In early Sanskrit medical texts, linga means \\"symptom, signs\\" and plays a key role in the diagnosis of a sickness, the disease., Quote: \\"Linga or Symptomatology: Linga acquires the second position in the Tri Sutra. It includes entire signs and symptoms of the diseases and health also. Only the knowledge of Hetu is not sufficient for the diagnosis of Aaturavastha. Hence Linga or the symptomatology is very useful tool in the diagnosis of a disease.\\" The author of classical Sanskrit grammar treatise, Panini, states that the verbal root ling which means \\"paint, variegate\\", has the sense \\"that which paints, variegates, characterizes\\". Panini as well as Patanjali additionally mention lingam with the contextual meaning of the \\"gender\\". In the Vaisheshika Sutras, it means \\"proof or evidence\\", as a conditionally sufficient mark or sign. This Vaisheshika theory is adopted in the early Sanskrit medical literature. Like the Upanishads, where linga means \\"mark, sign, characteristic\\", the texts of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy use linga in the same sense. In the Samkhya sutras, and in Gaudapada's commentary on Samkhyakarika, the term linga has many contextual meanings such as in verses 1.124.136, 3.9.16 and 5.21.61, as it develops its theory of the nature of atman (soul) and sarira (body, prakriti) and its proposed mechanism of rebirth. In the Purva Mimamsa Sutra and the Vedanta sutra, as well as the commentaries on them, the term linga appears quite often, particularly in the form of \\"lingadarsanac ca\\" as a form of citing or referencing prior Hindu literature. This phrase connotes \\"[we have found an] indicative sign\\", such as the \\"indicative sign is in a Vedic passage\\". There is persuasive evidence in later Sanskrit literature, according to Doniger, that the early Indians associated the lingam icon with the male sexual organ. For example, the 11th- century Kashmir text Narmamala by Kshemendra on satire and fiction writing explains his ideas on parallelism with divine lingam and human lingam in a sexual context. Various Shaiva texts, such as the Skanda Purana in section 1.8 states that all creatures have the signs of Shiva or Shakti through their lingam (male sexual organ) or pindi (female sexual organ). However, the Sanskrit literature corpus is not consistent. A part of the literature corpus regards lingam to be sexual and the phallus of Shiva, while another group of texts does not. Sexuality in the former is inherently sacred and spiritual, while the latter emphasizes the ascetic nature of Shiva and renunciation to be spiritual symbolism of lingam. This tension between the pursuit of spirituality through householder lifestyle and the pursuit of renunciate sannyasi lifestyle is historic, reflects the different interpretations of the lingam and what lingam worship means to its devotees. It remains a continuing debate within Hinduism to this day, states Doniger. To one group, it is a part of Shiva's body and symbolically saguna Shiva (he in a physical form with attributes). To the other group, it is an abstract symbol of nirguna Shiva (he in the universal Absolute Reality, formless, without attributes). In Tamil Shaiva tradition, for example, the common term for lingam is kuRi or \\"sign, mark\\" which is asexual. Similarly, in Lingayatism tradition, the lingam is a spiritual symbol and \\"was never said to have any sexual connotations\\", according to Doniger. To some Shaivites, it symbolizes the axis of the universe. In the Dṛg-Dṛśya-Viveka (Seer & Seen), an Advaita text attributed to Adi Shankara and others and translated by Swami Nikhilananda, the Subtle body is referred to as \\"lingam, because it enables the Jiva or the embodied being to realise Brahman.\\" (p. 17)Nikhalananda, Swami (1931), Drg-Drsya-Viveka. An inquiry into the nature of the 'seer' and the 'seen.', Sri Ramakrishna Asrama https://archive.org/details/drgdrsyaviveka030903mbp The term Linga also appears in Buddhist and Jaina literature, where it means \\"sign, evidence\\" in one context, or \\"subtle body\\" with sexual connotations in another. =Muslim rule= After the 11th-century invasion of the subcontinent by Islamic armies, the iconoclast Muslims considered the lingam to be idolatrous representations of the male sexual organ. They took pride in destroying as many lingams and Shiva temples as they could, reusing them to build steps for mosques, in a region stretching from Somanath (Gujarat) to Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) to Chidambaram (Tamil Nadu), states Doniger. =Orientalist literature= The colonial era Orientalists and Christian missionaries, raised in the Victorian mold where sex and sexual imagery were a taboo subject, were shocked by and were hostile to the lingam-yoni iconography and reverence they witnessed. The 19th and early 20th-century colonial and missionary literature described lingam-yoni, and related theology as obscene, corrupt, licentious, hyper- sexualized, puerile, impure, demonic and a culture that had become too feminine and dissolute. To the Hindus, particularly the Shaivites, these icons and ideas were the abstract, a symbol of the entirety of creation and spirituality. The colonial disparagement in part triggered the opposite reaction from Bengali nationalists, who more explicitly valorised the feminine. Vivekananda called for the revival of the Mother Goddess as a feminine force, inviting his countrymen to \\"proclaim her to all the world with the voice of peace and benediction\\". According to Wendy Doniger, the terms lingam and yoni became explicitly associated with human sexual organs in the western imagination after the widely popular first Kamasutra translation by Sir Richard Burton in 1883. In his translation, even though the original Sanskrit text does not use the words lingam or yoni for sexual organs, and almost always uses other terms, Burton adroitly avoided being viewed as obscene to the Victorian mindset by avoiding the use of words such as penis, vulva, vagina and other direct or indirect sexual terms in the Sanskrit text to discuss sex, sexual relationships and human sexual positions. Burton used the terms lingam and yoni instead throughout the translation. This conscious and incorrect word substitution, states Doniger, thus served as an Orientalist means to \\"anthropologize sex, distance it, make it safe for English readers by assuring them, or pretending to assure them, that the text was not about real sexual organs, their sexual organs, but merely about the appendages of weird, dark people far away.\\" Similar Orientalist literature of the Christian missionaries and the British era, states Doniger, stripped all spiritual meanings and insisted on the Victorian vulgar interpretation only, which had \\"a negative effect on the self-perception that Hindus had of their own bodies\\" and they became \\"ashamed of the more sensual aspects of their own religious literature\\". Some contemporary Hindus, states Doniger, in their passion to spiritualize Hinduism and for their Hindutva campaign have sought to sanitize the historic earthly sexual meanings, and insist on the abstract spiritual meaning only. Iconography and worship The traditional lingam rituals in major Shiva temples includes offerings of flowers, grass, dried rice, fruits, leaves, water and a milk bath. Priests chant hymns, while the devotees go the sanctum for a darshana followed by a clockwise circumambulation of the sanctum. On the sanctum walls, typically are reliefs of Dakshinamurti, Brahma and Vishnu. Often, near the sanctum are other shrines, particularly for Shakti (Durga), Ganesha and Murugan (Kartikeya). In the Hindu tradition, special pilgrimage sites include those where natural lingams are found in the form of cylindrical rocks or ice or rocky hill. These are called Svayambhuva lingam, and about 70 of these are known on the Indian subcontinent, the most significant being one in Kashi (Varanasi) followed by Prayaga, Naimisha and Gaya. The historic lingam iconography has included: *Mukhalingam, where the lingam has the face of Shiva carved on it. An Ekmukha lingam has just one face, Chaturmukha lingam has four faces in the cardinal directions, while a Panchamukha lingam has a total of five (the fifth is on the top) and represents Sadashiva. Among the mukha-lingam varieties, the four face version are more common. *Ashtottara-sata linga, where 108 miniature lingas are carved on the pujabhaga (main linga) following certain geometric principles. *Sahasra linga, where 1001 miniature lingas are carved on the pujabhaga (main linga) following certain geometric principles (set in 99 vertical lines, 11 horizontal). *Dhara linga, where lingas have five to sixty four fluted facets, with prime numbers and multiples of four particularly favored. *Lingodbhavamurti, where Shiva is seen as emerging from within a fiery lingam. On top of this icon is sometimes a relief of a swan or goose representing Brahma, and a boar at the bottom representing the Varaha avatar of Vishnu. This reflects the Shaiva legend describing a competition between Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu, as to who has priority and superiority. A lingam may be made of clay (mrinmaya), metal (lohaja), precious stone (ratnaja), wood (daruja), stone (sailaja, most common), or a disposal material (kshanika). The construction method, proportions and design is described in Shaiva Agama texts. The lingam is typically set in the center of a pindika (also called yoni or pithas, symbolizing Shakti). A pindika may be circular, square, octagonal, hexagonal, duodecagonal, sixteen sided, alliptical, triangular or another shape. Some lingams are miniaturized and they are carried on one's person, such as by Lingayats in a necklace. These are called chala-lingams. The Hindu temple design manuals recommend geometric ratios for the linga, the sanctum and the various architectural features of the temple according to certain mathematical rules it considers perfect and sacred. Anthropologist Christopher John Fuller states that although most sculpted images (murtis) are anthropomorphic or theriomorphic, the aniconic Shiva Linga is an important exception. According to Shaiva Siddhanta, the linga is the ideal substrate in which the worshipper should install and worship the five-faced and ten-armed Sadāśiva, the form of Shiva who is the focal divinity of that school of Shaivism.Dominic Goodall, Nibedita Rout, R.

The various styles of lingam iconography are found on the Indian subcontinent and southeast Asia.  Lingayatism  A necklace with linga-containing pendant is constantly worn by the Lingayats. Lingayats, a sect of the Shaivite religious tradition in India, wear a miniaturized linga called the istalinga. Initially known as Veerashaivas (heroic worshippers of Shiva), since the 18th century adherents of this faith are known as Lingayats. This tradition originated in Karnataka around the 12th-century. Lingayatism is derived from the term linga and suffix ayta. The term Lingayat is based on the practice of both genders of Lingayats wearing an iṣṭaliṅga (also called karasthala-linga) contained inside a box with a necklace all the time. The istalinga is a personalized and miniature oval-shaped linga and an emblem of their faith symbolising Parashiva, the absolute reality and their spirituality. It is viewed as a \\"living, moving\\" divinity within the Lingayat devotee. Everyday, the devotee removes this personal linga from its box, places it in left palm, offers puja and then meditates about becoming one with the linga, in his or her journey towards the atma-linga.  Pilgrimage sites  An ice lingam at Amarnath in the western Himalayas forms every winter from ice dripping on the floor of a cave and freezing like a stalagmite. It is very popular with pilgrims. In Kadavul Temple, a 700-pound, 3-foot-tall, naturally formed Spatika(quartz) lingam is installed. In future this crystal lingam will be housed in the Iraivan Temple. it is claimed as among the largest known spatika self formed (Swayambhu) lingams. Hindu scripture rates crystal as the highest form of Siva lingam. Shivling, , is a mountain in Uttarakhand (the Garhwal region of Himalayas). It arises as a sheer pyramid above the snout of the Gangotri Glacier. The mountain resembles a Shiva lingam when viewed from certain angles, especially when travelling or trekking from Gangotri to Gomukh as part of a traditional Hindu pilgrimage. A lingam is also the basis for the formation legend (and name) of the Borra Caves in Andhra Pradesh. Banalinga are the lingam which are found on the bed of the Narmada river. Lesser known Bhooteshwarnath Mahadeva in Gariaband district of Chhattisgarh is a rock Shivlinga and said to be the Largest Natural Shivlinga in the world. , whose height is increasing with each passing year.

Formed in the early 2010s, Google Brain combines open-ended machine learning research with information systems and large-scale computing resources. Machine Learning Algorithms and Techniques Research at Google. Retrieved May 18, 2017 History The so-called \\"Google Brain\\" project began in 2011 as a part-time research collaboration between Google Fellow Jeff Dean, Google Researcher Greg Corrado, and Stanford University professor Andrew Ng. Ng had been interested in using deep learning techniques to crack the problem of artificial intelligence since 2006, and in 2011 began collaborating with Dean and Corrado to build a large-scale deep learning software system, DistBelief, on top of Google's cloud computing infrastructure. Google Brain started as a Google X project and became so successful that it was graduated back to Google: Astro Teller has said that Google Brain paid for the entire cost of Google X. In June 2012, the New York Times reported that a cluster of 16,000 computers dedicated to mimicking some aspects of human brain activity had successfully trained itself to recognize a cat based on 10 million digital images taken from YouTube videos. The story was also covered by National Public Radio and SmartPlanet. In March 2013, Google hired Geoffrey Hinton, a leading researcher in the deep learning field, and acquired the company DNNResearch Inc. headed by Hinton. Hinton said that he would be dividing his future time between his university research and his work at Google. Projects =Artificial-intelligence-devised encryption system= In October 2016, the Google Brain ran an experiment concerning the encrypting of communications. In it, two sets of AI's devised their own cryptographic algorithms to protect their communications from another AI, which at the same time aimed at evolving its own system to crack the AI-generated encryption. The study proved to be successful, with the two initial AIs being able to learn and further develop their communications from scratch. In this experiment, three AIs were created: Alice, Bob and Eve. The goal of the experiment was for Alice to send a message to Bob, which would decrypt it, while in the meantime Eve would try to intercept the message. In it, the AIs were not given specific instructions on how to encrypt their messages, they were solely given a loss function. The consequence was that during the experiment, if communications between Alice and Bob were not successful, with Bob misinterpreting Alice's message or Eve intercepting the communications, the following rounds would show an evolution in the cryptography so that Alice and Bob could communicate safely. Indeed, this study allowed for concluding that it is possible for AIs to devise their own encryption system without having any cryptographic algorithms prescribed beforehand, which would . =Image enhancement= In February 2017, Google Brain announced an image enhancement system using neural networks to fill in details in very low resolution pictures. The examples provided would transform pictures with an 8x8 resolution into 32x32 ones. The software utilizes two different neural networks to generate the images. The first, called a \\"conditioning network,\\" maps the pixels of the low-resolution picture to a similar high-resolution one, lowering the resolution of the latter to 8×8 and trying to make a match. The second is a \\"prior network\\", which analyzes the pixelated image and tries to add details based on a large number of high resolution pictures. Then, upon upscaling of the original 8×8 picture, the system adds pixels based on its knowledge of what the picture should be. Lastly, the outputs from the two networks are combined to create the final image. This represents a breakthrough in the enhancement of low resolution pictures. Despite the fact that the added details are not part of the real image, but only best guesses, the technology has shown impressive results when facing real-world testing. Upon being shown the enhanced picture and the real one, humans were fooled 10% of the time in case of celebrity faces, and 28% in case of bedroom pictures. This compares to previous disappointing results from normal bicubic scaling, which did not fool any human. = Google Translate = The Google Brain project contributed to Google Translate. In September 2016, Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) was launched, an end-to-end learning framework, able to learn from a large number of examples. While its introduction has increased the quality of Google Translate's translations for the pilot languages, it was very difficult to create such improvements for all of its 103 languages. Addressing this problem, the Google Brain Team was able to develop a Multilingual GNMT system, which extended the previous one by enabling translations between multiple languages. Furthermore, it allows for Zero-Shot Translations, which are translations between two languages that the system has never explicitly seen before. Google announced that Google Translate can now also translate without transcribing, using neural networks. This means that it is possible to translate speech in one language directly into text in another language, without first transcribing it to text. According to the Researchers at Google Brain, this intermediate step can be avoided using neural networks. In order for the system to learn this, they exposed it to many hours of Spanish audio together with the corresponding English text. The different layers of neural networks, replicating the human brain, were able to link the corresponding parts and subsequently manipulate the audio waveform until it was transformed to English text. = Robotics = Different from the traditional robotics, robotics researched by the Google Brain Team could automatically learn to acquire new skills by machine learning. In 2016, the Google Brain Team collaborated with researchers at Google X to demonstrate how robots could use their experiences to teach themselves more efficiently. Robots made about 800,000 grasping attempts during research. Later in 2017, the team explored three approaches for learning new skills: through reinforcement learning, through their own interaction with objects, and through human demonstration. To build on the goal of the Google Brain Team, they would continue making robots that are able to learn new tasks through learning and practice, as well as deal with compound tasks. In Google products The project's technology is currently used in the Android Operating System's speech recognition system, photo search for Google+ and video recommendations in YouTube.

It operated from 1940 to 1958. Unlike the similarly named Rebels, the Gulf Coast Rebel used conventional locomotive-pulled equipment. The train was the last GM&O; service south of St. Louis, Missouri when it was discontinued in 1958.  History  In 1935 the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad (GM&N;), a predecessor of the GM&O;, introduced the Rebel between New Orleans, Louisiana and Jackson, Tennessee. It was the first lightweight streamliner in the Southern United States. In the fashion of mid-1930s streamliners each consist was built as a cohesive set with streamlined power car, although the cars were not articulated. Even before its merger with the Mobile and Ohio Railroad in September 1940 the GM&N; had begun assembling equipment for a new Rebel. The new Gulf Coast Rebel began operation on October 29, 1940, using streamlined heavyweight cars. New ALCO DL-105 diesel locomotives pulled the train which gained the nickname \\"Big Rebel\\", differentiating it from the \\"Little Rebels\\" which remained in service. The new train was painted in the same red-and-silver paint scheme as the Little Rebels and included hostess service, another innovation from the original service. The trains operated on an overnight schedule between St. Louis and Mobile, using the former M&O; main line via Meridian, Mississippi. The GM&O;'s merger with the Alton Railroad in 1947 brought several changes to the Gulf Coast Rebel. The most obvious was the change in appearance as the train received the Alton's maroon-and-red paint scheme. In addition, the train received new lightweight cars built by American Car and Foundry. Both the Little and Big Rebels were the victim of the worsening passenger market in the 1950s. The GM&O; discontinued the original Rebels in 1954 and the Gulf Coast Rebel, its last passenger train south of St. Louis, in 1958.  Equipment  The original Gulf Coast Rebel used a heavyweight consist which received some streamlining and other cosmetic enhancements. Two consists were necessary to protect the service. Each had a mail car, baggage car, coach, buffet-coach, and sleeping car (Tower-series 8-section 1-drawing room 3-double bedroom cars Show Me and Deep South). As mentioned above, American Car and Foundry delivered new lightweight cars to the GM&O; in 1947–1948 which were used throughout the system. These included 68-seat coaches, 31-seat parlor cars, and four 4-section 8-roomette 1-compartment 3-double bedroom sleeping cars. Originally ALCO DL-105s (styled by Otto Kuhler) handled the Gulf Coast Rebel. Later motive power included the ALCO PA-1 and the uncommon Baldwin DR-6.

Plot On Saturday at 5pm, 25 hours before the wedding, Marshall and his son, Marvin, are taking the bus in the final leg of their journey to Farhampton. In an effort to get Marvin to sleep, Marshall constantly uses rhymes (the entire episode is worded with rhymes), and begins telling stories of his friends. The episode also features Lin-Manuel Miranda as a rhyming and rapping bus passenger named Gus. =\\"Mosby at the Bat\\"= The first story concerns Ted while he was still a professor. Lisa, a young physics professor, introduces herself to Ted and asks him out to dinner to learn more about his inspiring lectures. Ted is at first excited, but then wonders if Lisa will view the dinner as a date or as just a meeting between coworkers. Throughout the dinner, Ted receives mixed signals on whether it is a date or not, and Lisa eventually reveals she had once dated a New York Yankees player. Ted is so intrigued he urges her to tell who; she reveals him to be Derek Jeter just as she casually describes their meeting as \\"a lovely date\\", but when Lisa shows him a picture, Ted is annoyed to find out it is actually Barney. =\\"Robin Takes the Cake\\"= The next story begins with Robin having recently broken up with one of her ex-boyfriends (Marshall is unable to remember who), and is unashamedly shoveling down sweets at a bakery. She then runs into Simon and is surprised to see he is more clean-shaven and professional than before, but quickly becomes dejected when he reveals he's engaged to be married. In anger, Robin steals Simon's wedding cake and begins eating it at Ted's apartment, much to Ted's scolding and bewilderment. When Robin has finished nearly half the cake, Lily arrives, and Robin feels remorse for her actions and decides to stop. Lily, however, convinces Robin to be strong and finish the cake. Her struggle to finish soon draws others to the apartment to cheer her on, including Barney who brings a keg of beer. She eventually finishes, then proceeds to do a keg stand (Marshall adds that afterwards they had to get her stomach pumped). =\\"Barney Stinson, Player King of New York City\\"= The final story has the gang at McLaren's, where Barney has his sights set on a girl who just walked into the bar. Lily says the girl is out of Barney's league, but Barney claims no girl is unworthy as he is the \\"Player King of New York City\\". Barney relates a story of how, after bedding Lisa, he was called before the High Council of Players, a group of pickup artists of differing social backgrounds each with a specific borough of New York City in which they can seduce women (the members are all played by Neil Patrick Harris): hipster Pickle Jar Bob in Brooklyn, guido Staten Island Lou in Staten Island, airline pilot impersonator Captain Bill in Queens, New York Yankee impersonator Bronx Donnie in the Bronx, and upper class Tuxedo Charlie with whom Barney shares Manhattan, using Fifth Avenue as the boundary; Charlie gets the eastern side, Barney the western side. Because Lisa lives on East 22nd Street and Barney had impersonated Derek Jeter to bed her, Barney must offer Robin and Lily to Charlie and Donnie respectively as recompense for using Donnie's methods in Charlie's territory. Barney agrees, then offers a toast of champagne to everyone. They all drink except Barney, who reveals he had poisoned the drink, and laughs as the other members die. In the present, the others sarcastically applaud Barney's story, but reveal Ted to be making out with the girl to punish Barney for sleeping with Lisa, leaving Barney annoyed and jealous. The scene is an allusion to a similar meeting scene in The Godfather in which the leaders of the five crime families of New York meet to settle a dispute. Marshall nearly gets Marvin to sleep when the bus suffers a flat tire, and Marshall and the other riders step outside to view a fireworks display. Marshall tells Marvin he will be with his mother soon, but dreads the impending fallout he would face from Lily finding out about his judgeship. Marshall hopes Marvin is too young to remember the day's events, but Future Ted remarks the fireworks would be the first memory Marvin would remember. Gus, another passenger on the bus, informs Marshall that the Farhampton Inn is only five miles away, and Marshall decides to walk there, a decision Future Ted explains Marshall would later regret. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology praised the episode's rhyming scheme on a creative level, but nevertheless called it \\"just another filler episode\\". Kuchman singled out Marshall's line, \\"I'm so sorry this journey has been a bummer,\\" asking, \\"Is there a line that sums up this season more perfectly?\\" The A.V. Clubs Donna Bowman graded the episode an A−, praising the writing, performances and the tight editing. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 5.5/10, stating that while he commended the writers for following through on having an all-rhyming episode, he felt that the gimmick ended up falling flat. Nicholson noted that this episode, which does almost nothing to advance the plot, should have been used in another season rather than the final one.

Plot On Saturday at 8pm, 22 hours before the wedding, Barney is handcuffed to a pipe in a security office begging a guard to push a button on a novelty toy. Robin orders the guard not to, furious as the rehearsal dinner started ten minutes earlier and she is now in a laser tag security office waiting for the police to arrive. They then tell the story of how they ended up there. A few months earlier, Barney hit upon the idea of a rehearsal dinner at a laser tag arena. The gang hates the idea and Robin reminds him that their marriage will be about compromise such as when she agreed to hold the wedding in New York City rather than Canada like she wanted to when they first got engaged. Barney agrees they'll have a normal rehearsal dinner, but it is obvious he isn't going to drop the idea. As a wedding present, Ted tells Robin and Barney that he's willing to take up piano lessons again and play at the dinner, which they refuse until Ted offers to dress like Liberace while doing it. A few days after Robin surprised Barney with his bachelor party, he tearfully declares that the wedding is off and asks her to move out of his apartment. Robin, convinced by Barney's tearful performance, is shocked and ready to pack only to see her suitcase with puppies inside, prompting her to force Barney to stop pulling pranks. Later at the bar, the gang try to convince Barney that Robin has a point, only for Barney to adamantly insist that Robin is trying to pull off a surprise laser tag rehearsal dinner by claiming that the rehearsal dinner at the Farhampton Inn was a fake. Though the rehearsal dinner is about to begin, Barney continues to insist that Robin is planning the actual dinner as a surprise at a laser tag arena. When Robin reveals the ice dispenser has broken, Barney volunteers to go get more ice, believing that he is playing into Robin's supposed plan. She has him promise not to leave, but Barney immediately leaves anyway and heads straight to the laser tag arena, despite promising Robin he would not. Meanwhile, Lily is distraught that she is not privy to details about the rehearsal dinner because of her inability to keep secrets. She reminds Ted that she has been able to keep mum about his move to Chicago and points out that he has broken his promise to play piano at the wedding rehearsal dinner dressed as Liberace as his piano lessons had not gone well. Lily tells Ted and Robin about her plan to Italy being in shambles because Marshall took up a judgeship without asking her and that they cannot return to their apartment, as it has already been sublet. Ted is angry with Marshall for his selfishness, but Lily knows that her husband would never intentionally hurt her. Robin must deal with Barney after learning that he went to the laser tag arena and is currently awaiting arrest after threatening one of the staff after realizing there was no surprise rehearsal dinner. As Robin leaves to pick up Barney, Ted comforts Lily by telling her he knows she can keep a secret and offers to tell her one. He whispers it in her ear, and allows her to announce to the guests that there's going to be a change of venue. Back in the present, Barney is still convinced this is one massive surprise and wants to just head to the laser tag rehearsal dinner despite Robin insisting there isn't one. He insists that marriage isn't just about playing pranks as Robin notices that Barney has freed himself from the handcuffs before he hands her a pair of ice skates. Barney admits that he may lie in the future if it means an amazing surprise; snow begins to fall in the office. When the security guard presses the button on the novelty toy, Robin is surprised to see the office's walls suddenly lift up, revealing that the \\"office\\" is in the middle of an ice rink surrounded by their family and friends. Barney reveals that because they couldn't have the wedding in Canada, he organized a Canadian-themed rehearsal dinner instead and gives Robin a signed picture of Wayne Gretzky as his wedding gift. The security guard turns out to be Legendary Canadian figure skater Toller Cranston. As Alan Thicke and James sing, Lily thanks Ted for letting her in late on the secret; Ted admits that the piano lessons were a cover for taking figure skating lessons, only to fall over almost straight away (Future Ted notes that it takes a lot longer than two months to learn how to figure skate). Robin tells Barney how much she loves him, and promises to get him back for this as Ted limps back over. In the final scene, Barney admits that he loves Canada as he lists several amazing things the country has given the world including Robin and one-quarter of himself. She thanks him and the two skate off as Ted goes by playing the piano as promised. Critical reception Bill Kuchman of Popculturology called the episode \\"impressive\\", remarking that even with Cristin Milioti missing again, \\"HIMYM still found a way to reconnect with what makes the show special.\\" Kuchman criticized the decision to keep Marshall separate from the group, noting that he would normally do whatever he needed to make it to such an important event in his friends lives. The A.V. Clubs Donna Bowman graded the episode an A−, admitting that the conclusion of the episode caught her by surprise having expected Robin to have genuinely set up a laser tag rehearsal dinner. Max Nicholson of IGN gave the episode 7.9/10, saying it delivered a strong rehearsal outing for Barney and Robin.

When Stuntz was young, his immediate and extended family moved from Ohio to Seattle. He had a sister named Alice Stuntz Marionneaux, whom he frequently visited in the later years. Stuntz's father, Chauncey Richards Stuntz, who worked in the sugarcane business, would be absent to work for most of the time. In 1920s, he was promoted as the general manager of a sugar mill, 'Jobabo' in Oriente Province in Cuba. During his father's absence, Stuntz' mother, Evelyn Elliot Stuntz, managed the family and arranged the children's summer vacations. Education Stuntz was born in Milford, Ohio, United States. Before he went to college, he studied in Queen Anne High School, Seattle. In autumn 1931, he enrolled at the University of Washington and received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1935. Stuntz began his undergraduate study as a forestry major. After taking a general mycology course offered by J. W. Hotson in the Botany Department, he developed an interest in fungi. Hence, he decided to change his major to Botany. After he finished his bachelor's degree study, he began his master's degree with Dr. Hotson while working on Inocybe. (Stuntz and Hotson 1938) He did not finish his master's degree; instead, he went to Yale University for his doctoral degree. His transfer was encouraged by Professor T. C. Frye, who viewed Stuntz as a potential replacement of Dr. Hotson, whose health was becoming problematic. Amazingly, John S. Boyce accepted Stuntz as a student and allowed him continue to do Inocybe research, which is not Dr. Boyce's expertise. Stunz finished his doctoral degree at Yale in 1940. Career The earliest record of Stuntz's research activities can be traced back to March 30, 1934, when he was a junior in college. By that time, he began to collect, photograph and describe agarics as well as other fungi. Later, Stuntz was influenced by Dr. Hotson to begin working on the agaric taxonomy. In addition, Alexander H. Smith was another person who had a great impact on Daniel's choice of profession. They met each other on the Olympic Mountains during collections and after that, they began a long friendship. Alex kept encouraging Stuntz to continue his work on Inocybe and other agaric genera, which laid the fundamental basis for Stuntz's taxonomy works in the future. Stuntz kept working on Inocybe during his master's and doctoral degree. In 1940, after he finished his doctoral degree from Yale, he was hired as an instructor at the University of Washington. He retained this title until 1945 when he was promoted as an assistant professor and, later, in 1950 he became an associate professor. In 1958, he became a professor in Botany department and kept this title until he retired. At the beginning of his professional journey as a fungal taxonomist, he collected almost every agaric he could find. Later, due to teaching commitments, his collection was mainly limited to Pluteus, Hebeloma and Inocybe. Eventually, he spent all his efforts concentrating on Inocybe classification. During his teaching process, Stuntz would collect almost every group of fungi he could find and try to identify it. He would write his own keys to his collections and a few of them were eventually published. One of his important publications was a book named How to identify mushrooms to Genus IV: keys to families and Genera, published in 1977. (Stuntz 1977) During his last several years, he developed an interest in the resupinate, nonporoid Aphyllophorales and enrolled several students working on those. (Libonati-Barnes 1981) Throughout his professional career, he had served as mentor for 39 graduate students and published 40 papers. Contributions Stuntz has a wide interest in the fungi collection and identification. His personal collection number had over 20,000 specimens. Besides his personal interest and collections, he also developed an excellent fungal herbarium at the University of Washington, in which most of the materials were identified to genus and species. Some of the specimens were exchanged from other sources and this directly led to the wide diversity of fungal group collection of the herbarium though Stuntz was mainly focused on certain group studies. Stuntz was a talented linguist, which offered him the potentiality to be a bibliophile of the first order. Benefiting from different literature resources such as University of Washington Libraries, Yale University Library, and Michigan mycological library, he deeply understood the importance of an extensive library to researchers, and decided to put both money and time into building a mycological library, which was later called the superb mycological library in the University of Washington. Stuntz purchased all the library items using his own money and many of them were fairly expensive relative to Stuntz's salary. Among the approximately 1300 books in his mycological library were also expensive and rare volumes. After he died, he donated his book collections to both the Department of Botany and Suzzallo Library. According to his intention, these books and papers are available to researchers and others.(Ammirati and Libonati-Barnes 1986) One of the most noticeable gifts of Stuntz was his teaching ability. He could efficiently deliver the scientific information to a wide variety of people: from the mycological researchers to the amateurs. His lecture was described as well organized, beautifully illustrated, and appropriately-paced. In 1951, His evaluation was ranked fourth among all of the teachers in the University of Washington. In 1974, he received the Alumni Distinguished Teaching Award, which indicated the recognition to him by the public.(Information from winners of UW's distinguished teaching awards) For years, Stuntz was a 'public servant.' Not only did he help with the identification of fungi, but he also spent considerable amount of time giving lectures to amateur mycologists. One of his major contributions to the amateur mycology is that he and the members of Pacific Northwest mushroom societies established the Pacific Northwest Key Council. In addition, Stuntz's most important tribute to the public service is the establishment of the Daniel Elliot Stuntz Memorial foundation by the amateur and professional mycologists in the Pacific Northwest. This foundation is aimed to provide financial support to students pursuing advanced degree in the fungal systematics and to provide financial support for travel expenses of amateur and professional mycologists in the Pacific Northwest. In the past 7 years, the Foundation has contributed over $68,000 in grants to support the mycological studies.(Information from website of Puget Sound Mycological Society) Other personal interests Stuntz had interest not only in science, but also in arts. He played the piano well and had a great love on classic chamber music. However, Stuntz's father did not think the art is a practical field, so the lack of encouragement from his family may have directly lead him to give up his musical interest. Besides the love of music, Stuntz also loved outdoor recreations such as hiking. In addition, he played badminton for several years and was known as an excellent player. Bibliography *Ammirati, J.

It is located at the intersection of Farm to Market Roads 611 and 1614, about east of Snyder. It lies within the physiographic region known as the Rolling Plains in the valley of the Clear Fork Brazos River. History A number of homesteaders moved into the area to form the nucleus of a community in the mid-1880s. A post office was opened May 26, 1888, and residents chose the name Hobbs for Vachel Hobbs Anderson, a local settler. Unfortunately, the post office was discontinued February 15, 1910. By 1914, the community had a general store, telephone service, and a population of 45. Hobbs received electricity in 1939, and in 1940, the community had three businesses, a school, a Baptist church, a number of scattered dwellings, and a population of 70. The Hobbs Co-op Cotton Gin was organized in the 1940s. From 1970 through 2000, the population of the community remained steady at an estimated 91. Education Robert Martin, a Baptist preacher, held camp meetings and opened a school in the community in 1887, using a tent until a combination school and church building was erected the following year. The church-school was called Buffalo, for its location on Buffalo Creek, a tributary of the Clear Fork Brazos River. A new school building was erected in 1908, and the name of the school was changed to Hobbs. The new school gradually became the center of this dispersed community. In 1925, a number of small schools consolidated to form the Hobbs Rural High School District, and a two-story brick high school was constructed. Hobbs High School was replaced with a new building in 1956, but was closed in 1989, and pupils are now bused to Rotan, Roby, or Snyder.

Bored with the idea of a traditional guest room, Storschen decided to create four uniquely themed rooms for his guests: the Symbol room, the Orange room, the Castle room, and the Mirrors room. He named the hotel Propeller Island City Lodge, based on the pseudonym he had adapted from the Jules Verne novel of the same name. As the hotel's popularity grew, Strochen purchased vacant space in the same building and in 1998 began designing 27 new guest rooms. Floors 1 and 2 were opened in 2001, and the hotel's 3rd floor was completed in August 2002. As of 2013, the hotel consists of thirty rooms, including an art gallery, reception area, and Frühstücksraum (breakfast room).

Before that, he was a Superior Court judge for Riverside County, California. Biography =Early life= Gabbert was born in Oxnard, California on June 20, 1909. In 1912, when he was three years old, he moved with his parents to Riverside, California. His father, J. R. Gabbert, purchased the Riverside Enterprise newspaper and worked as both editor and publisher. Gabbert grew up working with the metal type in his father's print shop at the press. =Education= Gabbert attended public grade schools and Poly High School in Riverside. After graduating from South Pasadena High School in 1927, he attended Riverside Junior College, where he was the Student Body President in 1929, and then Occidental College where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1931. He then attended Duke University School of Law from 1931 to 1932, but transferred to Boalt School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley in 1933. He completed his LL.B. at Boalt in 1934. It was during his time at Riverside Junior College that Gabbert met fellow student Rupert Costo, a Native American activist, who became a lifelong friend and fellow advocate for the establishment of a campus of the University of California in Riverside. During World War II, he enlisted in the United States Army and in 1944 served with the Criminal Investigation Division in New Guinea and the Philippines. =Legal career= Following his graduation from Boalt Law School, Gabbert was admitted to the California Bar on October 16, 1934 and to the Philippine Islands Bar in 1945. Gabbert served as Deputy District Attorney for Riverside County from 1935 to 1938. He next went into private practice with the father and son legal team of Best & Best in Riverside, thus forming the new firm of Best, Best & Gabbert in 1938, where he practiced law until 1943 and then from 1945 to 1949. He also served as a City Court Judge for Riverside County from 1941 to 1943. In 1949, he was appointed by Governor Earl Warren as a Judge in the Superior Court of Riverside County, a position he held from 1949 to 1970. (It was at this time that his name was removed from the law firm that eventually became known as Best, Best, & Krieger.) In May 1970, Governor Ronald Reagan appointed him as a Presiding Justice of the California Appellate Court, Fourth Appellate District, Division Two, a position which he held until his retirement on June 1, 1974. =Civic involvement= Gabbert served as a school board member for the Riverside Unified School District from 1946 to 1949. He is a former president of the Riverside County Bar Association as well as the Lions Club, the Present Day Club, and the Citizens University Committee. He also served on a variety of civic and charitable organizations both in a membership as well as a leadership capacity and was a member of the Executive Committee of University of La Verne College of Law. =University of California, Riverside advocacy= In his role as President of the Citizens University Committee, Gabbert worked with Rupert Costo and other civic leaders to lobby the University of California system to establish a campus in Riverside. =Marriage and children= Gabbert married Katherine Jeanette Fuller in Tulare, California on June 11, 1938. The couple had three children: * Sarah Gabbert (June 29, 1940 - present) * Katherine Gabbert (December 24, 1942 - present) * Scott Gabbert (January 28, 1946 - present) Political views Gabbert was registered as a Republican.

Statik Link writes songs in the jazz fusion subgenre of jazz music. His music has been classified as a combination of jazz, hip-hop, soul music, and electro- funk sounds. STATIK LNK's music is centered around his work as a solo producer, instrumentalist, and DJ. As an electronic act, he defies genre norms by fusing together the sounds of jazz, soul, funk, electronic music, and hip- hop. STATIK LNK lists his primary influences as the music of Robert Glasper, John Coltrane, J Dilla, Madlib, Miles Davis, BadBadNotGood, and Kanye West. STATIK LNK was once an electronic duo. On December 2, 2016, STATIK LNK announced via their Facebook page that a long-time member, Dan Dwyer, was leaving the group. Biography = Early life = Joshua Andres was born in Zanesville, Ohio on January 3, 1987. He is the eldest of three children, including a sister, Kalee, and a brother, Matt. His parents, Tim and Kris, had no musical backgrounds. From the age of 3 until 18, Josh would live in the small city of Sandusky, Ohio. He attended Sandusky City Schools where he would learn to read and write music. At the age of 5, Josh's dad, Tim, enrolled him into guitar lessons at Musician's Alley music store. He would then learn to read and write music. He attended guitar lessons until the age of 12, where he then switched to Trumpet. It is during his studying of the Trumpet, while at Sandusky City Schools, that he would learn Jazz Music. After his graduation in 2005, Statik Link would move to Toledo, Ohio and attend the University of Toledo. At the University of Toledo, Josh would study Music Theory and Music Technology. During his studies, he was introduced to recording software, Pro Tools, which allowed him to arrange and compose music. = Early career = After his graduation from the University of Toledo in 2009, Josh, pursued a career in hip-hop. While in Toledo, he met and began to produce records for Big J Tha White Wonder. While working with Big J, he placed his first major release with notable artists Emilio Rojas, and D-Black. During this time he began to travel to New York City frequently. During one of his trips to New York, Josh met EDM DJ/Producer MING (DIM MAK/Mau5trap/Hood Famous) through a mutual producer while working on a project at New York City recording studio Stadium Red. Following their meeting, Josh developed a business partnership with Ming (DJ), which involved shopping musical works to commercial television companies. It was during a meeting in 2011 that MING introduced Josh to EDM Bass Music. In an interview with Urban Hit Promotions Magazine Josh is quoted “I thought Electronic Music was only Techno and House, which I respected, but was never a big fan of.” [2] Josh goes on to say that MING's introduction to Dubstep was the moment that Josh made the switch from hip-hop production to EDM resulting in the creation of Statik Link. = Career in EDM = In 2012 during a tour stop in Chicago promoting “Statik Link The EP,” Josh was introduced to trap music. Trap music, primarily known for its hip-hop roots, consists of Electro sounding instruments, vocal samples, and hip-hop drums. Fascinated with the sound of trap music, Josh began work on Statik Link's new project concentrating primarily on the growing EDM trend of trap music. Using the hip-hop sound that he was well respected for during his hip-hop days, Josh would string together a hit of trap music remixes leading up to his debut release. While working on Statik Link's debut Trap EP, Josh released tracks that experienced major success. His first trap remix of Zomboy’s “Here To Stay” was critically acclaimed. The remix resulted in a top Trap Remix title being award to Statik Link for May 2013 by DJCity.com, the most popular DJ Pool in the USA [4]. The remix of \\"Here To Stay\\" was followed up with the success of Statik Link's remix of Kaskade's single \\"Atmosphere\\" which went viral over the internet resulting in a top hit among Kaskade Trap Remixes across the Internet. Josh continued to work on Statik Link's debut Trap EP while touring the US. While working on his debut EP, Josh stayed in contact with MING. Upon completion of the EP, Josh submitted the work to Hood Famous Music, MING's label imprint. During this time, MING had been experiencing major success with his debut release on DIM MAK, King Kong The EP. MING had also begun production in trap music. His work resulted in two Top 10 Beatport charting singles (“Rock”, by Paul Mendez at #2 and “Colossal” by Fortune Cookie at #5 on the Beatport Hip Hop charts). Impressed by one of the productions on the album Josh had submitted, MING partnered with Statik Link to produce the anthem “Block Party” ft Moxiie. The critically acclaimed single experienced much success resulting in a Top 100 post on iTunes and a top 10 post on Beatport. Following the success of \\"Block Party\\", Statik Link released their 1st major label remix of Australian recording artist Bonny Anderson for Sony Music in 2014 [8]. The remix was featured on Australian artist Bonnie Anderson (singer)'s EP \\"Blackout.\\" In August 2014, Statik Link signed with Bass Music label \\"Dirty Duck Audio.\\" Dirty Duck Audio, known for their work with UK Trap artist Gold Top, released Statik Link's 3 track EP on September 8, 2014, via Beatport exclusive. The EP contains 3 new original works titled \\"Clap When She Walkin,\\" \\"Get Down (Dat Azz),\\" and \\"Xposed Ft Big J Tha White Wonder.\\" The EP featured Big J Tha White Wonder who also frequents Statik Link's original productions. The EP was critically acclaimed and received support from EDM.com (9). The EP debuted at number 22 on the Beatport hip-hop charts (10). On January 12, 2015, Statik Link and Dirty Duck Audio partnered to release the \\"100HRTZ (The Remixes)\\" EP on Beatport (11). The EP featured remixes from Grammy-nominated producer Ming (DJ), Haterade (DJ), Instant Party! (DJ), Trentino (DJ), Jelo (DJ), Stuart Software (DJ), and a special VIP Mix from Statik Link. The EP was critically acclaimed and received support from EDM.com, Trapsounds, YourEDM, and many other prominent EDM sites and blogs. After a 5 year career in dance music, Statik Link announced Dan Dwyer was leaving the group. In a Facebook post made by Statik Link (14), the group explains that Dan was leaving due to personal reasons, and Josh was taking control of Statik Link. In the same announcement, Josh explained that he was returning to live instrumentation and changing the direction of the music to focus more on funk, soul, and jazz sounds. = Current career = Following the announcement, Josh took two years off to focus on rebranding the sound of Statik Link. During this time he would release some remixes and music on his Audiomack and Soundcloud page. However, it wasn't until January 2019, that he released a full-length album titled \\"Into The Inferno, Vol.1\\". The project featured eight, short, jazz, ambient, and electronic-infused tracks. Following the release of \\"Into The Inferno, Vol 1\\", he would release the \\"Shapes Of Music, Vol 1\\", in February 2019, pulling from a pallet of Jazz, funk and soul instrumentation, with hip-hop inspired percussion. His most recent project, an EP titled \\"808s and Soul\\", was released on March 2019 features rappers Machine Gun Kelly, Vyle, Ian Kelly, OG Maco, Keysha Freshh, Freddie Black, and Big J Tha White Wonder. The EP is characterized by heavy soul samples and sounds from the 1970s. In addition to his releases, Statik Link partnered with Tracklib to release his projects for producers to sample and use to recreate into original works. = Formation Of Onza Records = In late 2018, Statik Link formed his boutique label, \\"Onza Records\\", to release music that he describes as \\"forward-thinking music.\\" The label releases music that is primarily created with live instrumentation. = Shapes Of Music, Vol. 2 Release = On June 24, 2019, Statik Link released his 4th full-length studio album, \\"Shapes Of Music, Vol. 2.\\" The album was received with critic praise with the album reaching number 1 on the iTunes Jazz Charts and the lead single, \\"Summertime Magic\\" also reaching number 4 on the Jazz single charts (15). = Name Change = On January 6, 2020, Statik Link announced via Facebook post that he was changing his name from Statik Link to STATIK LNK. His reason for doing so is to \\"separate my old style (EDM, Trap, Dance) from new style (Jazzy, Soulful, Live Instrumentation) on Spotify, Apple Music, and Tidal. I'd like to remove a lot of my older music, but it's owned by smaller labels and am unable to take it off of my current Statik Link profile hence the new name.

The facility was completed and entered operation in 1949. The facility is named after Lieutenant W. Garfield Thomas Jr., a Penn State journalism graduate who was killed in World War II. For a long time, the Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel was the largest circulating water tunnel in the world. It has been declared a historic mechanical engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. Today, in addition to many of its Navy projects, the facility tunnel-based research has expanded into pumps for the Space Shuttle, advanced propulsors for ships, heating and cooling systems, artificial heart valves, vacuum cleaner fans, and other pumps and propulsors related products. History After the end of WW II, the US military started investing heavily in higher education nationwide. At the same time, Harvard terminated its Underwater Sound Laboratory (USL) which invented the first acoustical homing torpedo (FIDO); consequently Penn State hired Eric Walker, USL's assistant director to head its electrical engineering department, and the Navy transferred USL's torpedo division to Penn State - where it became the Ordnance Research Laboratory (ORL). The ORL eventually became the Applied Research Laboratory. The Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel was built at Penn State in cooperation with ORL by the ARL for further torpedo research. Construction completed on October 7, 1949, and began operating six months later. Since then, the facility has expanded into viscosity, sound, wave, and wind research. In 1992, the facility underwent a complete overhaul. Capabilities The main water tunnel can be seen from the outside through the glass windows. The facility consists of a number of closed circuit, closed jet and open jet facilities. =Water Tunnels= The facility operates four water tunnels. Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel The Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel is the facility's largest water tunnel. The 100 feet long, 32 feet high, 100,000 gallons tunnel is a closed-circuit, closed-jet. The system is powered by 1,491 kW (2,000-hp) pump, with a 4-blade adjustable pitch impeller and can produce a maximum water velocity of 18.29 m/s (40.91 mph). The system is capable of producing pressures between 413.7 and 20.7 kPa. The tunnel is equipped with an array of instruments including: Propeller dynamometers, Five- hole pressure probe, Pitot probes, lasers, pressure sensors, hydrophones, planar motion mechanism (PMM), force balances, accelerometers, and acoustics arrays. Smaller Water Tunnels The facility operates two additional smaller water tunnels with diameters of 12 inches and 6 inches. Both are closed-circuit, closed-jet. The 12-incher is a 150 horsepower (111.8 kW) system capable of producing maximum water velocity of 24.38 m/s (54.53 mph). The 6-incher is a 25 hp (18.64 kW) system that can deliver a max velocity of 21.34 m/s (47.74 mph). Both tunnels are equipped with lasers, pressure sensors, pressure transducers, and hydrophones Ultra-High Speed Cavitation Tunnel The facility also has a 1.5 inch closed-circuit, closed-jet cavitation tunnel capable of producing a maximum velocity of 83.8 m/s (187 mph). The stainless steel tunnel, 75 hp (55.9 kW) tunnel supports pressures as high as 41.4 kPa and temperatures of 16 °C to 176 °C. =Other facilities= Water tunnel main entrance. In addition to the water tunnels, the facility operates an array of wind tunnels, glycerin tunnels, and anechoic chamber for used in many physics problems. The Boundary Layer Research Facility (BLRF) operates a 12-inch turbulent pipe flow of glycerine. Additionally, the facility operates a 20 hp (14.91 kW), open-jet, 1,750 rpm Axial-Flow Fan with a 36.58 m/s (81.83 mph) maximum velocity used for basic engineering research in turbomachinery blading. Another 2.75 meter diameter, 100 hp (74.6 kW) closed-circuit used specifically for research in viscous sublayer and in modeling of turbulent flow of fluids next to a wall at large scale.

He was the favorite pupil of Bronner and in 1934 the winner of the Dutch Prix de Rome. With the annuity of the Prix de Rome, he lived with his wife, the artist Annetje Meijs, three years in Rome and in Paris. After his return again in the Netherlands he settled in Amsterdam, where he lived his entire life. In 1938 his application for membership of the Dutch Society of Sculptors in Amsterdam was first rejected. After the so-called \\"Bolhuis incident\\" in which seven members (among others John Rädecker and Han Wezelaar) quit the organisation, Bolhuis finally was accepted as a member. After World War II he made resistance and liberation monuments in the Dutch municipalities Winterswijk, Epe, Beverwijk and Amsterdam. Bolhuis died in 1975 and was buried in Amsterdam.

This concept is mostly associated with religious skepticism, secular humanism and atheism. Unconsciousness and nonexistence after death is also believed by some religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses. https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/bible-teach/where-are-the-dead/ However they do not believe that death is necessarily the end since they believe in the resurrection. https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/bible-teach/hope- resurrection-of-dead-loved-ones/ According to contemporary scientific theories of consciousness, the brain is the basis of subjective experience, agency, self-awareness, and awareness of the surrounding natural world. When brain death occurs, all brain function permanently ceases. Many people who believe that death is a permanent cessation of consciousness also believe that consciousness is dependent upon the functioning of the brain. Scientific research has discovered that some areas of the brain, like the reticular activating system or the thalamus, appear to be necessary for consciousness, because damage to these structures or their lack of function causes a loss of consciousness. Through a naturalist analysis of the mind (an approach adopted by many philosophers of mind and neuroscientists), it is regarded as being dependent on the brain, as shown from the various effects of brain damage. Quoting neuroscientist Sam Harris (video ).  In philosophy  In the Apology of Socrates (written by Plato), after Socrates is sentenced to death, he addresses the court. He ponders the nature of death, and summarizes that there are basically two opinions about it. The first is that it is a migration of the soul or consciousness from this existence into another, and that the souls of all previously deceased people will also be there. This excites Socrates, because he will be able to conduct his dialectic inquiries with all of the great Greek heroes and thinkers of the past. The other opinion about death is that it is oblivion, the complete cessation of consciousness, not only unable to feel but a complete lack of awareness, like a person in a deep, dreamless sleep. Socrates says that even this oblivion does not frighten him very much, because while he would be unaware, he would correspondingly be free from any pain or suffering. Indeed, Socrates says, not even the great King of Persia could say that he ever rested so soundly and peacefully as he did in a dreamless sleep. Cicero, writing three centuries later in his treatise On Old Age, in the voice of Cato the Elder, similarly discussed the prospects of death, frequently referring to the works of earlier Greek writers. Cicero also concluded that death was either a continuation of consciousness or cessation of it, and that if consciousness continues in some form, there is no reason to fear death; while if it is in fact eternal oblivion, he will be free of all worldly miseries, in which case he should also not be deeply troubled by death. Similar thoughts about death were expressed by the Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius in his first-century BC didactic poem De rerum natura and by the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus in his Letter to Menoeceus, in which he writes; : \\"Accustom yourself to believing that death is nothing to us, for good and evil imply the capacity for sensation, and death is the privation of all sentience; therefore, a correct understanding that death is nothing to us makes the mortality of life enjoyable, not by adding to life a limitless time, but by taking away the yearning after immortality. For life has no terrors for him who has thoroughly understood that there are no terrors for him in ceasing to live. Foolish, therefore, is the man who says that he fears death, not because it will pain when it comes, but because it pains in the prospect. Whatever causes no annoyance when it is present causes only a groundless pain in the expectation. Death, therefore, the most awful of evils, is nothing to us, seeing that, when we are, death is not come, and when death is come, we are not. It is nothing, then, either to the living or to the dead, for with the living it is not and the dead exist no longer.\\" Paraphrasing philosopher Paul Edwards, Keith Augustine and Yonatan I. Fishman note that \\"the greater the damage to the brain, the greater the corresponding damage to the mind. The natural extrapolation from this pattern is all too clear — obliterate brain functioning altogether, and mental functioning too will cease\\".books.google.com , Augustine & Fishman, 2015, p. 206. Contemporary atheist scientists Steven Pinker and Sean Carroll assert that death is equivalent to eternal oblivion, as physical theories based on scientific materialism allow for no mechanism to continue consciousness after death. Legal use The term \\"eternal Oblivion\\" has been used in international treaties, such as in Article II of the Treaty of Westphalia 1648. It has also been used in legislation such as in the English Indemnity and Oblivion Act 1660, where the phrase used is \\"perpetual Oblivion\\" (it appears in several of the articles in the act).An act of free and general pardon, indemnity and oblivion Oblivion and subjectivity Thomas W. Clark, founder of Center for Naturalism, wrote a paper titled \\"Death, Nothingness, and Subjectivity\\" (1994). He critiqued what he saw as a flawed description of eternal oblivion as a \\"plunge into darkness\\". When some imagine their deaths (including the non-religious), they project themselves into a future self which experiences an eternal silent darkness. This is wrong, because without consciousness, there is no awareness of space and no basis for time. For Clark, in oblivion there is not even an absence of experience, as we can only speak of experience when a subjective self exists. According to neuroscientist Giulio Tononi, consciousness is \\"all we are and all we have: lose consciousness and, as far as you are concerned, your own self and the entire world dissolve into nothingness.\\" See also * Annihilationism * Anatta * Consciousness after death * Information-theoretic death * Neural correlates of consciousness * Nirvana References Further reading *Martin, Michael; Augustine, Keith.

Complex phenotypes often require multiple traits working together in order to function properly. Phenotypic integration is significant because it provides an explanation as to how phenotypes are sustained by relationships between traits. Every organism's phenotype is integrated, organized, and a functional whole. Integration is also associated with functional modules. Modules are complex character units that are tightly associated, such as a flower.Wagner, Günter P. \\"Homologues, natural kinds and the evolution of modularity.\\" American Zoologist 36.1 (1996): 36-43. It is hypothesized that organisms with high correlations between traits in a module have the most efficient functions.Brock, Marcus T., and Cynthia Weinig. \\"PLASTICITY AND ENVIRONMENT‐SPECIFIC COVARIANCES: AN INVESTIGATION OF FLORAL–VEGETATIVE AND WITHIN FLOWER CORRELATIONS.\\" Evolution 61.12 (2007): 2913-2924. The fitness of a particular value for one phenotypic trait frequently depends on the value of the other phenotypic traits, making it important for those traits evolve together. One trait can have a direct effect on fitness, and it has been shown that the correlations among traits can also change fitness, causing these correlations to be adaptive, rather than solely genetic.Schlichting, Carl D., and Massimo Pigliucci. Phenotypic evolution: a reaction norm perspective. Sinauer Associates Incorporated, 1998. Integration can be involved in multiple aspects of life, not just at the genetic level, but during development, or simply at a functional level. Integration can be caused by genetic, developmental, environmental, or physiological relationships among characters.Wagner, Gunter P., and Lee Altenberg. \\"Perspective: Complex adaptations and the evolution of evolvability.\\" Evolution (1996): 967-976. Environmental conditions can alter or cause integration, i.e. they may be plastic.Schlichting, Carl D. \\"The evolution of phenotypic plasticity in plants.\\" Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 17 (1986): 667-693. Correlational selection, a form of natural selection can also produce integration. At the genetic level, integration can be caused by pleiotropy, close linkage, or linkage disequilibrium among unlinked genes.Murren, C. J., and P. X. Kover. \\"QTL mapping: a first step toward an understanding of molecular genetic mechanisms behind phenotypic complexity/integration.\\" Phenotypic integration: studying the ecology and evolution of complex phenotypes (M. Pigliucci and K. Preston, eds.). Oxford University Press, New York (2004): 195-212. At the developmental level it can be due to cell-cell signaling such as in the development of the ectopic eyes in Drosophila. It is believed that the patterns of genetic covariance helped distinguish certain species.Murren, Courtney J., Nicole Pendleton, and Massimo Pigliucci. \\"Evolution of phenotypic integration in Brassica (Brassicaceae).\\" American Journal of Botany 89.4 (2002): 655-663. It can create variation among certain phenotypes, and can facilitate efficiency. This is significant because integration may play a huge role in phenotypic evolution. Phenotypic integration and its evolution can not only create large amounts of variety among phenotypes which can cause variation among species. For example, the color patterns on Garter snakes range widely and are caused by the covariance among multiple phenotypes. Phenotypic Integration is important for many traits. One specifically is the development of fewer bones in the neurocranium. Origins Shortly after the structure of DNA was uncovered, Olson and Miller (1958) wrote the first book regarding the topic of phenotypic integration.Olson E.C. & Miller R.L. (1958) Morphological Integration. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. The term integration was first used in reference to genetics by Olson and Miller, referring to correlations among characters that are influenced by selection.Olson, Everett C., and Robert L. Miller. Morphological integration. University of Chicago Press, 1999. Following Olson and Miller, botanical studies on coherence between characters were done spanning over many years.Clausen, J. & Hiesey, W.M. (1960). The balance between coherence and variation in evolution. Proc. Natl Acad Sci U S A, 46, 494–506. Its first expansion was in the construction of a morphological integration genetic model constructed by Lande (1980). However, the term \\"Phenotypic Integration\\" was first coined by Pigliucci and Preston, in their book, Phenotypic Integration, which helped elucidate the observed laws of correlation and some theoretical issues regarding the topic.Pigliucci, Massimo, and Katherine (Katherine A.) Preston. Phenotypic integration. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. Natural Selection and Phenotypic Integration Phenotypic Integration can be favorable or unfavorable with respect to natural selection. It has been shown that certain combinations of correlated traits can be unfavorable to an organism. In an ontogenetic study of laboratory rats, certain covariances among developmental characters which produced differing functions in the skull and limb were less favorable than another set that contributed to skull and limb structure.Zelditch, Miriam Leah. \\"Ontogenetic variation in patterns of phenotypic integration in the laboratory rat.\\" Evolution (1988): 28-41. The most common form of selection on phenotypic integration is correlational selection. Correlational selection is a form of natural selection that favors certain combinations of traits (phenotypic integration). It can promote both genetic correlations and high levels of genetic variation. It has even been found that correlational selection may be the most common form of natural selection.Schluter, Dolph, and Douglas Nychka. \\"Exploring fitness surfaces.\\" American Naturalist (1994): 597-616. Occasionally, this form of selection will favor a group of traits at the expense of others and if it does favor a particular set of traits it will include the most used traits whose functional effectiveness is essential for their ability to work together, and whose successful interaction is needed for the fitness of the individual.Herrera, Carlos M. \\"Deconstructing a floral phenotype: do pollinators select for corolla integration in Lavandula latifolia?.\\" Journal of Evolutionary Biology 14.4 (2001): 574-584.Endler, John A. \\"Multiple-trait coevolution and environmental gradients in guppies.\\" Trends in Ecology & Evolution 10.1 (1995): 22-29. Phenotypic integration may be the adaptive product of correlational selection. An example of natural selection favoring integration is in the color patterns and escape mechanisms of the Garter snake, Thamnophis Ordinoides.Brodie III, Edmund D. \\"Correlational selection for color pattern and antipredator behavior in the garter snake Thamnophis ordinoides.\\" Evolution (1992): 1284-1298. Another example is in plants that have highly-specific pollinators, natural selection favors plants that have highly specialized flowering to pair with the specific pollinators, and therefore high floral integration.Fornoni, Juan, et al. \\"How little is too little? The adaptive value of floral integration.\\" Communicative & integrative biology 1.1 (2008): 56-58. Northwestern Garter Snake's color patterns and escape mechanisms are integrated. Evolution of Phenotypic Integration Integration can be found at the genetic level due to gene linkage. Gene linkage involves multiple genes being inherited together during meiosis because they are close to each other on the same chromosome. Alleles at different loci can be inherited together if they are tightly linked. Large genetic correlations can only be upheld if the loci that influence different characters are tightly linked, or if high levels of inbreeding in the population occur. Even if selection favors the correlations, it will not be maintained unless those conditions are met. Selection will favor tight linkage because it is maintained better. Poorly linked genetic correlations will not last.Lande, Russell. \\"The genetic correlation between characters maintained by selection, linkage and inbreeding.\\" Genetical research 44.03 (1984): 309-320. Transposition allows the loci at different locations on the chromosome to move so that they can become close to each other and be inherited together. This is significant to understanding the relationship between phenotypic integration and evolution because it is one of the mechanisms of how multiple traits that are connected to each other to evolve and change together. For instance, the Papilio dardanus butterflies come in three different forms, each mimicking a different distasteful butterfly species.Nijhout, H. Frederik. \\"Polymorphic mimicry in Papilio dardanus: mosaic dominance, big effects, and origins.\\" Evolution & development 5.6 (2003): 579-592. Multiple loci contribute to these different forms, and a butterfly with alleles for form A at one locus and B at another locus would have poor fitness. However, the multiple loci are tightly linked, so they are inherited together as a single allele. Through transposition, these multiple loci ended up close to each other.Clarke, C. A., and P. M. Sheppard. \\"The genetics of some mimetic forms of Papilio dardanus, Brown, and Papilio glaucus, Linn.\\" Journal of genetics 56 (1959): 236-260. Mutations among these linked genes are the nonadaptive fuel which can create evolution. Evolution may also occur because the integration may have an adaptive advantage in a particular environment for an organism. It is also important to recognize that not only can the traits be inherited together, but inherited separately and selected together. Another important example of phenotypic integration evolving over time is the relationship between the neurocranium and the brain. Over the last 150 million years the number of bones in the brain has decreased while the size of the brain in mammals has changed. Integration between the brain and the skull has evolved over this time period to reduce the number of bones in the cranium, while increasing the size of the brain. This relationship between correlated traits has played an important role in the evolution of mammalian cranium structure and brain size.Richtsmeier, Joan T., et al. \\"Phenotypic integration of neurocranium and brain.\\" Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution 306.4 (2006): 360-378. Finally, development is another crucial cause of phenotypic integration that has evolved over time. Cell-signaling pathways which utilize integration in the form of complex interactions among specific cells in the pathway are crucial to proper development in many organisms. The interactions among the cells in the pathway, and the interaction of the pathways with other pathways have evolved over time to create complex structures.Artavanis-Tsakonas, Spyros, Matthew D. Rand, and Robert J. Lake. \\"Notch signaling: cell fate control and signal integration in development.\\" Science 284.5415 (1999): 770-776. Examples Aposematism in poison frogs has also shown that phenotypic integration may be involved. Aposematism is the use of warning colors to deter predators because it often conveys the organism being poisonous, and this study found that diet specialization, and chemical defense are integrated and help affect aposematism.Santos, Juan C., and David C. Cannatella. \\"Phenotypic integration emerges from aposematism and scale in poison frogs.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 108.15 (2011): 6175-6180. The Poison Dart Frog is an example of a species that illustrates phenotypic integration. In another study regarding the relationship of sexual ornaments and phenotypic integration, there seems to be a paradox where sexual traits are expected to be both less integrated for greater expression, and more integrated to better indicate physiological quality. However, in the case of the house finch, the female house finches select for males based on their likelihood to be a good parent. The females base their choice of male parental behaviors on the elaboration of the male’s sexual ornamentation. Thus, female choice favors hormonally controlled integration of male sexual behaviors and male sexual ornamentation.Pigliucci, Massimo. \\"Phenotypic integration: studying the ecology and evolution of complex phenotypes.\\" Ecology Letters 6.3 (2003): 265-272. Phylogenetically consistent patterns of phenotypic integration have also been recently reported in leaves, floral morphology, and dry fruits as well as in the morphology of some animal organs.Pérez‐Barrales, Rocío, Juan Arroyo, and W. Scott Armbruster. \\"Differences in pollinator faunas may generate geographic differences in floral morphology and integration in Narcissus papyraceus (Amaryllidaceae).\\" Oikos 116.11 (2007): 1904-1918.Pigliucci, Massimo. \\"Phenotypic integration: studying the ecology and evolution of complex phenotypes.\\" Ecology Letters 6.3 (2003): 265-272. Future work Understanding phenotypic integration will continue as more research and understanding is done with regards to genetic, developmental, and physiological mechanisms, and learn more about the relationship of selection and complex phenotypes.Murren, Courtney J. \\"Phenotypic integration in plants.\\" Plant Species Biology 17.2‐3 (2002): 89-99. Research of this topic can even be beneficial to modern biomedicine.Richtsmeier, Joan T., et al. \\"Phenotypic integration of neurocranium and brain.\\" Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution 306.4 (2006): 360-378.

The stories have a wide range in page length and in severity of crimes, but all follow themes of class inequality, justice, and, entitlement. For instance, in the story of \\"The Taker\\" the main character feels entitled to everything. He feels that those in society who have something he doesn't owe him that thing. So, he takes it. The criminals usually feel justified in their own actions and treat things such as murder as things that have to be done. In the stories \\"Night Drive\\" and \\"The Other\\" the main character seems to commit his crime or crimes for the sake of his own sanity. Christopher Ballantyne remarks on Fonseca's inclination to examine order in a world of violence. Even though his publication came out before this collection of short stories was released, his point holds true for this piece of Fonseca's work as well as his older ones. He notes that, above all, this is what Fonseca's work excels at doing. \\"The Taker and Other Stories\\" also presents many different worlds caught between violence and order. Publication The books was published by Open Letter in Rochester, New York in 2008; it has an ISBN of 9781934824023. The stories were translated from the Portuguese by Clifford E Landers Reception Dan Bevacqua of Words Without Borders gave the collection a positive review that praises Rubem Fonseca's ability to convey class inequalities in an interesting way and his style that makes the stories seem like they are confessions from their characters. He does however note that the collection lacks something in subtlety and can be improved in that front. The review given by Publishers Weekly is complementary to the individual stories but has a negative view on the collection as a whole. It notes that the constant barrage of grimness leaves the reader weary, and gets a bit too repetitive when read all together. Still it finds that Fonesca's style is entertaining and will please many fans of South American fiction in the world.

He studied the symbiotic relationships of fungi and beetles focusing on ambrosia beetles and fungi, bio-systematics of hemiascomycetes and discomycetes and fungal diseases.  Early life and education  Batra was born in Nawan Jandanwala, a village near the Thar Desert in Western Punjab, British India. His immediate family included two sisters and two brothers. Batra was the first member of his family to receive schooling, and he attended high school in Lahore, Pakistan. However, in the ethnic violence following the partition of British India in 1947, he lost all of his relatives on his mother's side, and his penniless family moved to Punjab, India. There, he began his interest in mycology as he hunted the hills for edible mushrooms to feed his family. After arriving in India, he went on to earn his Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees with Honours in Botany from Panjab University, Chandigarh as a President of India scholar. In 1956, he moved to the United States of America to study at Cornell University under the mycologist Richard P. Korf, receiving his Doctorate in Botany in 1958.  Career  Batra served as a lecturer for one year at the Deshbandhu College in Delhi before moving to the US. He also served in the Indian army. After completing his doctorate at Cornell University, he started teaching botany at Swarthmore College near Philadelphia where he met Suzanne W. Tubby, his future wife. He briefly worked for the Indian government in 1960s. He returned to the United States and joined the University of Kansas as a research associate while his wife was working on her doctorate in entomology there. Batra later became an assistant and associate professor, working on the symbiotic relationship of ambrosia fungi and beetles. In 1963, he became a US citizen. After his wife graduated in 1967, they moved to Beltsville, Maryland where he joined federal government's Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and became a senior scientist and research leader. In 1986, he served as science advisor to the director of Beltsville. He retired in 1994. After his retirement, he served as coordinator of the International Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems, a UNESCO project aimed at providing information regarding food and agriculture for developing countries.  Personal life  Batra married Suzanne W. Tubby in a Hindu wedding ceremony on 12 June 1960 in Delhi, India, and they had two children, daughter Mira and son Persa. He was a man of diverse interests, famous for his excellent sense of humor. Once, he dressed up in a plaid shirt, jeans and a straw hat and entered the Greenbelt Labor Day parade, with 13 piglets and a sow that he had borrowed from the research station. He was also actively involved in the community activities and affairs in Beltsville, taking part in the opposition to sale of the research station's land to developers. Batra was a noted linguist, fluent in six Indian languages, as well as a master in English, Hindi, Urdu, French and German. He additionally knew some Arabic and Russian, and was reported to have translated Khruschev's famous 1956 speech, \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\", from Russian to both English and Arabic for others as he listened to the speech on television. According to his former Beltsville colleague, Marie Tousignant, he also combined his interests in linguistics and mycology and \\"... once translated all of the Latin scientific terms into Japanese\\". Batra died following a cerebral hemorrhage in Washington D.C. on 20 May 1999. His funeral followed a traditional Indian reception where, in reference to his field of study, mourners were served with truffles, morels, oyster and shiitake mushrooms. He featured among the 10 people selected by the Washington Post for their annual in memoriam article, \\"Passings 1999\\".  Publications  During his career, Batra published more than 130 articles and reviews, and authored four monographs including World Species of Monilinia. He served as an editor and edited four books and two volumes of a journal. He traveled the world before retirement in search of unknown fungi, discovering 38 new fungal species and 7 fungal diseases. He collaborated with wife Suzanne in studying fungus-cultivating insects, with their overview appearing in Scientific American in 1967. They also published on the mummy-berry disease of blueberries and huckleberries caused by Monilinia species, with their work published in Science in 1985. Batra was writing an autobiography, with a focus on his Indus Valley boyhood, but this was not complete when he died in 1999.

Early life Cani was born at Castel Bolognese, Province of Ravenna, Italy, and educated in his native province and at the Sapienza University of Rome, where he graduated D.D. and LL.D. Religious life He was ordained a priest in 1859, and accompanied the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, Dr. James Quinn, to Queensland. He was appointed parish priest at Warwick, Queensland in the same year, and went to Brisbane in 1868. Ten years later Dr. Cani was made Pro-Vicar Apostolic of Northern Queensland. On the death of Bishop Quinn, the diocese of Brisbane was divided into two and Dr. Cani was appointed, by papal brief, Bishop of Rockhampton, and was consecrated in St. Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, by Archbishop Roger Vaughan, on 21 May 1882. He commenced construction of St Josephs Cathedral in Rockhampton in 1893 but did not live to see it completed. Later life Cani contracted dengue fever in November 1897. While he recovered from the fever, he remained in poor health and died from heart failure at his residence in Rockhampton on Thursday 3 March 1898 aged 62. On Saturday 5 March 1898, a Solemn Requiem Mass was held at St Joseph's Pro-Cathedral after which he was buried in South Rockhampton Cemetery. As it was the custom of the Roman Catholic Church to bury a bishop within his cathedral, the burial in the local cemetery was intended as a temporary measure with the intention to inter him permanently within the cathedral once completed.

Personal life Robert Val Guthrie was born in Chicago on February 14, 1932, but moved to Lexington, Kentucky when his father became the principal at Dunbar High School. Living in segregated Kentucky, Guthrie went to Black schools, Black churches, and had friends only in the Black community. In this environment, Guthrie was exposed to limited number of career paths, and intended to be a public school teacher, as other options seemed out of reach. While stationed at Sampson Air Force Base during his military service in the 1950s, Guthrie met his wife, Elodia Sexton, a nursing student from Guatemala. They married, and went on to have one daughter and five sons together. Guthrie died on November 6, 2005 from brain cancer. Education and career To pursue his undergraduate studies, Guthrie attended Florida A&M; on a scholarship to play clarinet in the school's band. He was introduced to Psychology for the first time in his early undergraduate courses and he grew passionate about the discipline. Prof. Joseph Awkard, an African American faculty member, exposed Guthrie and his peers to the racial inequities espoused in much of the psychological research of the time; Awkard inspired Guthrie to broaden his horizons and consider becoming a psychologist. From 1950-1953, Guthrie's schooling was interrupted when he was drafted and served in the Korean War. In the military, he was exposed to a semblance of racial equality for the first time in his life, as the military was desegregated and had many policies discouraging racism. Guthrie was later quoted saying, “it is no secret that the military has done more to level the racial playing field in America than any other environment.” After the war, Guthrie returned to school to earn a master's degree from University of Kentucky, which had been newly desegregated in 1954. He was the only black student in the program, and felt unwelcome in the environment, lacking support from the faculty and fellow students. He felt his best option was to \\"get my education, then get the hell off campus.\\" After receiving his master's, he served in the Air Force until the early 1960s, at which point he moved to San Diego and taught in high schools before becoming the first Black professor at San Diego Mesa College. In 1968 at an American Psychological Association conference in San Francisco, Guthrie and his colleagues founded the Association of Black Psychologists, a major step for the Black psychology movement. Guthrie then earned his PhD in 1970 at the United States International University in San Diego. The following year, he was hired as an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, where he taught until 1973, when he was hired as a Research Psychologist at the National Institute of Education in Washington, D.C, where he studied multicultural issues. In 1976, he returned to San Diego to work at the Navy Personnel Research and Development Center, improving working conditions and personnel interactions in the Navy. He left this post in the 1980s, starting a private practice called Psychiatric Associates of South Bay, which focused on the needs of minorities in San Diego. He became a tenured professor at Southern Illinois University from 1990-1998, drawn by the opportunity to mentor students and expand their horizons the same way he had been inspired by his professors early in his career. After retiring from this post, he taught psychology of the black experience at San Diego State University for one class per semester, and spent time putting his stories and milestones in his life together for a memoir. Even the Rat was White In 1976, Guthrie published his most famous work, Even the Rat Was White: A Historical View of Psychology, which exposed a long history of racist work in psychology used to legitimize oppression of African Americans and promote the idea of black inferiority. The 2nd Edition of the book was published in 1998, with responses to new developments in the field, such as The Bell Curve which suggested racial differences in IQ and intelligence between races. Even more crucial than the examination of racist academic work was the book's work cataloging the work and triumphs of early Black psychologists. While he studied for his master's at the University of Kentucky, one of Guthrie's professors expressed doubts about the importance of contributions by Black psychologists such as Kenneth and Mamie Clark, which inspired Guthrie to begin researching the work of Black psychologists that preceded him. In Even the Rat Was White, Guthrie profiled pioneering Black psychologists and social scientists such as Francis Cecil Sumner, Kenneth and Mamie Clark, Allison Davis, Inez Beverly Prosser, Herman George Canady, Oran Wendle Eagleson, and Ruth Winifred Howard, as well as mentors of Black psychologists like G. Stanley Hall at Clark University who helped create a pipeline for African Americans to earn PhDs in psychology and join university faculties. Legacy In the spring of 2001, Guthrie became the first African- American to have his papers included in the National Archives of American Psychology in Akron, OH. The archive's director, David Baker, PhD, said about Guthrie: \\"We know almost nothing about the development of psychology at historically black colleges and universities, and only Bob Guthrie's work examines this in detail.\\" Regarding Even the Rat Was White, he stated that the book is \\"an excellent piece of historiography that offers a good, hard look at racism in the development of psychology,\\" and that without it, many of the profiled Black psychologists might have been forgotten. The American Psychological Association described Guthrie as \\"one of the most influential and multifaceted African-American scholars of the century.\\" In a tribute written after his passing, the American Psychological Association credited him as a valuable mentor in academia and a caring clinician, going on to say that through his work, \\"the possibility of a truly inclusive psychology was brought closer to realization,\\" and that his work was key to \\"helping psychology to recognize its shortcomings, and in moving it toward becoming a more open, diverse, and relevant discipline for all.\\" References External links *Even the Rat Was White Pearson Higher Education African-American academics African-American social scientists American social scientists 20th-century American educators 1932 births 2005 deaths ","title":"Robert V.

Taxonomies of entities are tree structures whose nodes are labelled with entities likely to occur in a web search query. Searches use these trees to match keywords from a search query to keywords from answers (or snippets). Taxonomies, thesauri and concept hierarchies are crucial components for many applications of information retrieval, natural language processing and knowledge management. Building, tuning and managing taxonomies and ontologies are costly since a lot of manual operations are required. A number of studies proposed the automated building of taxonomies based on linguistic resources and/or statistical machine learning . A number of tools using SKOS standard (including UnilexiconMalina F., Piper I. Visual vocabulary suite, A vocabulary editor and content tagging extension https://unilexicon.com/docs, PoolParty and Lexaurus editor to name a few) are also available to streamline work with taxonomies. Web mining is one approach to build a search engine taxonomy. The taxonomy construction process starts from seed entities, and mines available source domains for new entities associated with these seed entities. The process forms new entities by applying machine learning to current web search results for existing entities to identify commonalities between them. These commonality expressions then form parameters of existing entities, and turn into new entities at the next learning iteration.

The facilities include complete instrumentation for measuring and calibrating transducers and transducer arrays. The Acoustic Test Tank is equipped with the instrumentation required for determining the acoustic characteristics of sonar devices designed for frequency response calibrations, radiation pattern plots, and impedance and admittance characterizations. Additionally, ARL operates a Large Anechoic Chamber with the \\"mission is to increase the knowledge and understanding of applied electromagnetics in key areas of defense and commercial systems utilizing communications, navigation, and sensor-based systems such as direction finding, for example.\\" The facility is stationed in Warminster, Pennsylvania at the former Naval Air Warfare Center. Fluid dynamics research The Garfield Thomas Water Tunnel was constructed shortly after the establishment of the ARL at Penn State in cooperation with the U.S. Navy for further torpedo research. The facility operates one of the largest circulating water tunnel in the world. It also operates an array of wind tunnels, glycerin tunnels, and anechoic chamber for used in many physics problems and experiments. Nuclear research ARL operates the Advanced Nuclear Fuel Test Facility (ANFTF) which is a Westinghouse-funded facility to test advanced power reactors and fuel component designs. The facility entered operation in 1996 with a fully functional 600 MWe nuclear power plant, the Westinghouse AP600. The facility's objective is to characterize the effect of different fuel grid spacers on the onset of the departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) phenomenon and to quantify the critical heat flux (CHF) as the DNB event occurs. Space research In September 4, 2013 an agreement has been reached between the Applied Research Laboratory and NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The laboratory created the Space Systems Initiative which would allow the space center to provide bipropellant rockets and liquid methane/liquid oxygen control engines with the university to enabling students to gain a better understanding of rocket performance. Data and results would be shared with NASA. =Lunar Lion= The Penn State Lunar Lion is a team within the Applied Research Laboratory as part of the Space Systems Initiative which has joined the Google Lunar X Prize.

DrugMode specializes in 3D cell culture, and is based out of the University of Southern Denmark at Odense. Zadec focuses on Diabetes and nutrition, and has developed an oral anti-diabetes drug, RX-1, which is currently in clinical trials. Drug Delivery Solutions works in the field of dermatology and ophthalmology, developing topical drugs such as a cream to treat psoriasis. Technology Drug Delivery Solutions Limited, the Leatherhead daughter company of MC2 biotech, has developed a new method for drug formulation and delivery. This biliquid foam technology was patented as polyaphron dispersions (PAD) containing a complex internal phase, which are made as droplets of oil or multiphase liquid in an aqueous (or other hydrogen- bonding liquid) phase.Wheeler, D. A., Steele, D. F. (2008). WO2009001099. Great Britain. World Intellectual Property Organization Oil-soluble drug molecules can be dissolved within the oil phase, and drug delivery can be influenced by modifying the materials used in each phase.Childs, A., Alfred, D. (2011). EP171804 B1. Great Britain. European Patent Register A 2008 PAD patent claims that this foam-like emulsion is stable with up to at least 70% dispersed oil phase and at most 3% surfactant. This PAD drug delivery system can allow for extended release drug delivery in enteral route of administration, or it can be formulated to be administered as a wound dressing. Manufacturing using this technology is simple and low cost compared to gastroretentive dosage forms (GRDF) in the prior art. MC2 Biotek’s PAD technology has been applied commercially in dermatology and ophthalmology.http://www.scandinavianlifesciences.com/scan/db/detail.php?c=6086651k$SnIwjnCXFFLQ m MC2 Biotek is collaborating with a group of South African researchers led by Dr. Johan Louw at the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Professor Lizette Joubert at the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to research traditional rooibos and honeybush teas for their anti-diabetic and anti-obesity properties.http://www.sod- jpn.org/en/pdf/Khoisan%20Tea%20-%20Rooibos%20diabetes%20201202.pdf One collaborative study showed that aqueous hot water honeybush extract, when administered orally to type-2 diabetes rat models, promoted normoglycemia and improved other type-2 diabetes associated problems.

Ravindra and produced by Rockline Venkatesh under the banner Rockline Entertainments, both marking their debut in Telugu cinema. The film features Ravi Teja as the male lead with Hansika Motwani and Regina Cassandra playing the female leads. S. Thaman composed the music while Gautham Raju edited the film. Arthur A. Wilson and Jayanan Vincent handled the film's cinematography. The film was a \\"super hit\\" at the box office. The film revolves around two similar looking people, Baldev Sahay - a corrupt ACP in Kolkata and Tirupathi - a person aspiring to become a police officer in Hyderabad. The home minister of Bengal recruits Tirupathi to play Baldev to catch a gangster rescued by Baldev. Rest of the story is all about why Baldev became corrupt and how Tirupathi executed the unfinished mission of Baldev. Production began on 11 December 2013. The film's talkie part was shot in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Chennai and Bangkok while two songs were shot in Bulgaria marking it the first Telugu film to be shot there. Principal photography ended on 14 August 2014. The film was released on 12 September 2014. This film was remade into Bengali with the same title in 2016 starring Jeet, Sayantika Banerjee, and Nusrat Jahan. The film was dubbed in Hindi as Power Unlimited. Plot Baldev Sahay (Ravi Teja) is shown to be a corrupt yet valiant police officer working as an Assistant Commissioner of police in Kolkata. In an attempt to save a dreaded gangster named Ganguly Bhai (Sampath Raj), he loses his life and Ganguly is kidnapped by Baldev's allies Kundan (Ajay) and Rajeev (Subbaraju). The Home Minister Jayavardhan (Mukesh Rishi) is concerned about Ganguly being apprehended. Upon hearing the news of Baldev's death, his mother loses consciousness and is admitted to the hospital. Jayavardhan promises to the people that he will apprehend Ganguly Bhai and offer his resignation if he is not successfully doing the same. The media and the people comment on how an honest man like Jayavardhan had a really bad brother. Meanwhile, in Hyderabad, Tirupathi, a look-a-like of Baldev Sahay, is a happy-go-lucky guy whose sole aim in life is to become a police officer. He lives with his brother-in-law Animutyam (Brahmanandam) who is a circle inspector and every now and then, he steps into Animutyam's shoes to live his dream, albeit for a short period of time. To change his fortunes, he approaches Nirupama (Hansika Motwani) who claims to be a trader in gemstones relating to astrology, which can change a person's fortune but in reality she is just a con-woman. She gives him a ring that actually has no powers. Tirupathi ends up helping his brother-in-law to apprehend a dangerous criminal. However, Animutyam takes all the credit at the press meet which Tirupathi also attends. Animutyam later reveals that he had rejected Tirupathi's application to the police academy and that he resents him. By chance, Jayavardhan notices Tirupathi on the news. Just when it looks like his dream will never come true, Tirupathi is approached by Jayavardhan to take the place of Baldev and pretends as a person with noble intentions to put Ganguly in Jail. Tirupathi accepts it and visits Kolkata. He is posted to Kalighat and impersonating as Baldev, frees Ganguly from Kundan and Rajeev. He takes Ganguly to Jayavardhan. Jayavardhan stabs Tirupathi, severely injuring him. Jayavardhan reveals to Tirupathi (and the audience) that Ganguly is his actual brother and not Baldev as he had made him believe. He leaves Tirupathi to his fate. Kundan and Rajeev later track him down and treat him. When he recovers, they narrate the story of Baldev to Tirupathi. Kundan and Rajeev were appointed as Baldev's assistants by the commissioner of Anti-Corruption Bureau A. K. Mishra (Prakash Raj) to acquire proofs of Baldev's corruption. Baldev is always accompanied by Venkat (Brahmaji), a corrupt police officer along with Kundan and Rajeev everywhere he goes. He meets Ganguly and makes a deal with him for a huge ransom to handover Tiwari (Uttej), the only witness in the murder case of ACP Gautham (Aditya Menon) and his family who were killed by Jayavardhan's brothers Ganguly and Chotu on the former's order. In the meantime, he falls in love with Vaishnavi (Regina Cassandra), a philanthropist who too reciprocates it later. To get the proofs of Baldev's corruption, Kundan and Rajeev conduct a raid on his house where Vaishnavi is also present, who is livid on Baldev for maligning the goodwill of Aasha Foundation managed by her. There Kundan and Rajeev find a flash drive with a list of many police officers whom they suspect of being involved with Baldev in his corruption scam. However, they are surprised that even they are on the same list. Baldev's uncle then reveals the truth behind Baldev. Baldev's mother (Vinaya Prasad) wants to see him as a police officer and is admitted in a hospital for an important surgery. Baldev pays 1 million as fees for the surgery but at the selection, he is asked to pay a bribe of 1 million which is most common for all candidates according to the seniors. Baldev returns dejected but lies to his mother that he is selected to make her happy. The next morning, Baldev receives posting orders and he rushes to the hospital to show the same to his mother and uncle. But his mother is announced dead as she wished to forego the surgery to make Baldev a police officer. Baldev then vows to turn a corrupt police officer to pay the money on behalf of the honest candidates who are about to join the police force without their knowledge because of which they would not resort to corruption, which was the reason for his mother's death. After this incident, Baldev and Vaishnavi get engaged. Meanwhile, Baldev kills Chotu and arrests Ganguly for the murder case of ACP Gautham, with Tiwari serving as the chief witness. When he is about to present Ganguly and Tiwari in the high court, Venkat sells the evidence documents for a huge bribe along with the information regarding Tiwari and Baldev. Acting upon this information, Ganguly's goons kill Baldev's uncle and then proceed to attack Baldev and Tiwari at the court. However, Vaishnavi and Tiwari are killed in the hit while Baldev escapes. Baldev then retaliates and kidnaps Ganguly from Venkat's custody with the help of Kundan and Rajeev. In the process, he meets with a car accident in a hilly area and his car explodes, killing him. Tirupathi, now realizing the truth, decides to set things right. Jayavardhan, meanwhile, provides falsified evidence against the incumbent Chief Minister by claiming him to be the one who was backing Ganguly Bhai the whole time. After this incident, the Chief Minister is forced to step down and subsequently is arrested. Jayavardhan then gives his nomination for the post. Meanwhile, Ganguly Bhai despite being imprisoned starts operating his crime regime from within. Tirupathi rejoins the force and goes to Jayavardhan's house and makes a deal with him so as to keep his post provided that he, Tirupathi, turns a blind eye to all the activities of Ganguly Bhai. Tirupathi then becomes close to Jayavardhan's PA, Raja (Posani Krishna Murali) who gets agitated after he is insulted by Jayavardhan at a particular incident. Tirupathi introduces him to Nirupama and gets her to give him a ring to change his fortunes. However, it is, in fact, a camera embedded inside the fake gemstone with a microchip to capture audio. With the help of this ring, Tirupathi exposes Jayavardhan's corruption and evil designs to the media. Jayavardhan gets cornered and runs away \\"underground\\" along with his brother. In the process, he kidnaps Nirupama, Rajeev, Kundan, and Animutyam's Family. Meanwhile, A K Mishra, who has been following up this case with close interest unearths the fact that Baldev and Tirupathi are one and the same. Right before the car explosion, Baldev is thrown off the car and falls onto a freight carrier, rendering him unconscious. The truck carries him to Hyderabad and he is taken to the hospital. Animutyam is given the case. Animutyam's wife had lost her brother, named Tirupathi, long back in her childhood and has been searching for him ever since. Animutyam, realizing that the person in front of him is suffering from amnesia, decides to pass him off as his wife's brother to keep her happy but mainly to ensure that he wouldn't have to spend huge amounts of money for her search. Mishra reveals this fact to Jayavardhan and Ganguly and warns them that if Tirupathi comes to know of the truth, the consequences will be even deadlier. Tirupathi crashes into the stronghold of Ganguly Bhai and kills him and arrests Jayavardhan. Kundan, Rajeev, and everyone else decides not to reveal the truth to Tirupathi/Baldev and thus spare him the anguish over his uncle's and fiancé's death. Tirupathi later marries Nirupama and lives happily ever after in Kolkata while still posing as Baldev Sahay.

S. Ravindra, one of the writers of Balupu and finalized the film as his next project. Director cum producer Y.V.S. Chowdary, who produced Ravi Teja's Nippu in the past was announced as the producer of the film. The film was launched on 1 September 2013 at Y.V.S. Chowdary's office in Hyderabad. But because of financial problem, Y.V.S. Chowdary walked out of the project. Later prominent Kannada producer Rockline Venkatesh agreed to produce the film. The film had a second opening ceremony on 11 December 2013 at Filmnagar in Hyderabad. Kona Venkat, S. Thaman, Allan Amin and Gautham Raju were roped in as the dialogue writer, music director, fights choreographer and editor of the film respectively and coincidentally they all were a part of Ravi Teja's Balupu. Apart from them, Arthur A. Wilson, Brahma Kadali and A. Kumar Varma were roped in as the cinematographer, art director and production executive of the film respectively. The film's launch made headlines on 11 December 2013 (i.e. 11/12/13), a special calendar date that comes once in every 100 years. The film's title Power was declared on 24 January 2013. Incidentally, it was the title for Ravi Teja’s film under Meher Ramesh’s direction which never took off. =Casting= After Ravi Teja was signed to play the lead role, Hansika Motwani was roped in to play the female lead opposite Ravi Teja marking her first collaboration with him. She confirmed the news in her Twitter. She added \\"I can't reveal much about the character as it's premature to comment on it. But all I can say is that my role would be very unique and something that the audience have not seen so far. All this while, I've been playing bubbly and chirpy roles. But this time, my role is a performance-oriented one and I'm looking forward to it.\\" Apart from them, Prakash Raj, Brahmanandam, Kota Srinivasa Rao, Brahmaji, Posani Krishna Murali, Mukesh Rishi, Ajay, Sampath Raj, Subbaraju, Sapthagiri, Surekha Vani and Jogi Brothers were said to be the other vital cast in the film during the press meet held on the second opening ceremony of the film. It was also reported that Ravi Teja would play the role of a police officer in this film. Soon after the launch of the film, reports emerged that the team is searching for an actress for the role of the second heroine and few actresses names were shortlisted. It was also reported that the makers recruited popular Hindi Television actress Ragini Khanna as the second heroine which marks her South Indian debut. But Regina Cassandra was selected as the second heroine which she confirmed later. In an interview to The Times of India in early March 2014, Regina, about her role in the film, spoke \\"It's a big project for me and I'm quite excited about it. I like experimenting with my looks in films and I got a chance to do something radically different in terms of my appearance in Power. Besides, I have a strong characterization in the film. I hope I can pull off the role and get the audience in tune with the emotion in the film. It's going to be a challenging task for sure\\". After watching Suseenthiran's Pandiya Naadu, Harish Uthaman was selected for a negative role in the film by K. S. Ravindra. About his role, Harish said to the IANS that he would be playing the role of Sampath Raj's brother in this film. This marked his debut in Telugu cinema. It was revealed later that Ravi Teja's character is named ACP Bal Dev while Regina's character is named Vaishnavi. =Filming= The principal photography was planned for a start from 5 November 2013. However it couldn't start then due to unknown reasons. It was said during the film's opening ceremony that the film would be extensively shot in Hyderabad and Kolkata from 11 December 2013. After much silent shoot, it was reported that a song was shot on Ravi Teja and Hansika at Orion Mall, Rajajinagar at Bangalore. The song was said to be a mix of Telugu and Hindi words in which the main phrase is Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. It was choreographed by Vishnu Deva and the song was shot for five days. Later the film's shoot continued in Kolkata and Nagpur for a month. After shooting for a couple of weeks in Hyderabad and Bangalore, it was reported that the unit would proceed to Bangkok to shoot some action sequences. Meanwhile, the film's shoot continued in Hyderabad till Mid March and the next schedule started in Chennai from 17 March.

After completing shoot in locales of Hyderabad, the unit proceeded to Kolkata to start its next schedule of shoot from 6 April. It continued later at a house set in Annapurna Studios where Manam was shot. In the end of April, it was reported that the film's shoot would proceed later to Bangkok in the first week of May to shoot a fight sequence. There, a heavy chase sequence was planned to be shot in the supervision of Allan Amin which was said to have costed around 2 crores. In the second week of May, the shooting continued at a police station set in Ramoji Film City where some crucial scenes were shot. Ravi Teja, Brahmaji, Ajay and Kota Srinivasa Rao along with few other fighters were involved in that shoot which lasted for 3 days. Days later, some of the crucial scenes of the film was shot at Tagore House in Ramoji Film City on the lead pair. By that time, it was said that the film is in its final stages of principal photography and may end soon. In the fourth week of May, some key drama and sentimental sequences were shot at Hyderabad in which the lead star cast took part. The next schedule started on 23 June at Hyderabad. After a silent shoot at Hyderabad, the song Nuvvu Nenu Janta was shot on Ravi Teja and Hansika at Bulgaria in the second week of July 2014. The pre-planned Bangkok chase schedule started on 22 July 2014 and lasted for 10 days. On 28 July 2014 a car blast happened in the film's sets while shooting an action sequence at a forest area situated 100 kilometers away from Pattaya. Luckily, none were injured and the shooting schedule completed on that day. Hansika cut short her vacation to join the film's sets for commencement of new schedule. A song shoot was planned on Ravi Teja and Hansika at Ramoji Film City from 6 August to 10 August. The song Notanki Notanki was shot there which completed on 14 August with which the principal photography came to an end.  Soundtrack  S. Thaman was roped in to compose the music and background score for this film. It was reported that he began working on this film since 25 November 2013. The music sittings were held in Chennai and Thaman completed composing the songs of the film on 20 May 2014, which he confirmed in his Twitter by posting an image featuring himself, Ravi Teja and K. S. Ravindra in Thaman's studio. In the end of May 2014, Ravi Teja crooned for the number Notanki Notanki whose lyrics were penned by Bhaskarabhatla which was recorded in Chennai. On 25 July 2014, Thaman posted in his Twitter page that prominent music director Chakri sang a song in the film's soundtrack. On 4 August 2014, a press release stated that the film's soundtrack would be launched on 8 August 2014, by hosting a promotional event at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad. Times Music South, also known as Junglee Music acquired the audio rights of the film. The track list without details of singers, lyricists and duration was released on 6 August 2014, which featured 5 songs which were available later at Raaga.com. The soundtrack disc's back cover was released by Junglee Music on the next day which in addition contained the details of singers and the lyricists. The cast and crew of the film were present at the audio launch event at Shilpakala Vedika where V. V. Vinayak, Dil Raju and Karnataka MP Muniratna Naidu were invited as the chief guests. V. V. Vinayak presented the audio CD of the film to Muniratna Naidu amidst thundering applause from the audience. Reviewing the soundtrack, IndiaGlitz wrote \\"The very title must have got Thaman give foot-tapping numbers. Added to the title, Ravi Teja is the one doing the 'power' role. So, don't expect anything less than a sure-short mass album. And this one is exactly that. With lyrics coming from Bhaskarabhatla to Yadgiri to Sirivennela to Krishna Chaitanya, the lyrics are bound to be nothing less than eclectic. The vocals are alright, with none other than Ravi Teja and Chakri leading the pack. Adnan Sami and Karthik deliver a dekko as well. The album is a package for the fans of Mass Maharaja, who wouldn't demand musical richness when it is their favourite hero who is jiving.\\" Release In the end of March 2014, it was reported that the film would release worldwide in June 2014. Though the makers planned to release the film on 28 June 2014 which marks the completion of one year of Ravi Teja's comeback film Balupu, the film's release was postponed to August 2014 because of delay in shooting schedules. CineGalaxy, Inc. & Asian Movies together acquired overseas distribution rights of this film which they confirmed in a press release on 12 July 2014. In late July 2014, it was reported that the makers planned to release the film in October 2014. On 5 August 2014 it was confirmed that the film would release worldwide on 29 August 2014. However, it was postponed to 5 September 2014 to enjoy a solo release thus avoiding clash with Rabhasa which was scheduled for a release on 29 August. The film was awarded an 'A' certificate by Central Board of Film Certification and due to delay in those formalities, the film's release was postponed to 12 September 2014. Advance booking started on 8 September 2014, and it was reported that the film will be releasing in around 900 screens worldwide with the expected screen count being around 750 from India, 100 from United States and Canada and more than 25 from other overseas markets. =Marketing= The first look poster was released on 24 January 2014. The first poster showed Ravi Teja atop a Royal Enfield bike with the number AP 09 CM 9999 and he was shown wearing a police uniform and that first look poster received superb response from all the movie lovers. On 26 January 2014, the teaser of 43 seconds was released on the occasions of Republic Day as well as Ravi Teja's birthday. The teaser received high positive response and turned a grand hit in the social media just after its release and received more than 0.4 million views in a short span of time marking a record for Ravi Teja in YouTube. The audio release poster of the film was released on 4 August 2014. The second teaser of 37 seconds was released on 6 August 2014. The film's theatrical trailer was released on 26 August 2014. The trailer received positive response from critics as well as audience.  Reception  =Critical reception= Sify wrote \\"There is nothing novel about the movie. We have seen each scene before. It is a concoction of several movies. Power doesn’t come with the expected punch. Ravi Teja and some comedy scenes are plus points. The second half of the film is a let down. Overall, a regular commercial potboiler.\\" Hemanth Kumar of The Times of India rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"Directed by K S Ravindra, the film gives ample scope to Ravi Teja to flex his muscles, besides bring the roof down with his gags. For most part of the film, the seriousness with which he approaches both his characters keeps the proceedings going. And truth be told, it's a treat to watch him play the role of a serious cop, just like he did in Vikramarkudu\\" and added \\"It would seem that Ravi Teja cannot go wrong when he's in great form and his exuberance more than makes up for all that might have gone for a toss in the film. However, when it comes to his latest film, Power, there's a catch. The film is a fine example to show what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force. And the immovable object in this context is quite clearly the story, which is bogged down by the burden of multiple subplots it tries to carry\\". Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"He chooses a script which is an old formula, but he comes up with loads of entertainment. Though some of the scenes are typical film kind of, like wearing somebody’s khakhi uniform and solving cases like a police, but in the end it’s all entertainment. There are a few loopholes, but finally, ‘Power’ is a mass masala film with action, entertainment and glamour. It’s a typical Ravi Teja film.\\" Shekhar of Oneindia Entertainment rated the film 3 out of 5 and stated \\"Power is a powerful entertainer made to impress the fans of Ravi Teja. The film lacks freshness in story, but Bobby's amazing screenplay keeps you engrossed in the film. Apart from Mass Maharaja, Brahmanandam and Saptagiri will also rock the viewers. It is a paisa vasool entertainer for Ravi Teja fans.\\" IndiaGlitz rated the film 3 out of 5 and summarized \\"A promising film that has borrowed ideas from here and there. But the Kona effect and Ravi Teja's powerhouse act deliver the film. Comparisons with other films can harm the movie's prospects a bit, though one is sure to like it more than any of RT's movies in recent times\\". In contrast, Sridhar Vivan of Bangalore Mirror rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and wrote \\"To sum up; logically, the movie looks 'powerless', while comedy-wise, it is definitely 'powerful'. So, for those planning to watch a movie without any logic and purely for entertainment, then this may just be the right choice.\\" Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu wrote \\"It takes a special kind of nonchalance to package a film with a string of sequences, one illogical than the other, and lull the audience into believing that they are being entertained. Power tries hard to amuse and has a hangover of Kick and Vikramarkudu. Ravi Teja does his part well but the film itself offers nothing new\\" and remarked \\"Absurd fun, repackaged. ‘Power’ is only in the title.\\" Behindwoods rated the film 1.75 out of 5 and stated \\"Astute editing, lustrous cinematography and Ravi's screen presence come as a relief to an easily predictable story with a slow screenplay. Brahmanandham's gimmicks, Ravi Teja's cute expressions and a relatively long story to narrate with a pacifying twist towards the end do grab our attention, but, it's too late.\\" Filmyflavour rated the film 3 out of 5 and wrote \\"Power movie is a routine Telugu commercial film which has all the entertaining elements that you can try for this weekend\\" http://www.filmyflavour.com/ravi-teja-power-telugu-movie-review/ =Box office= The film collected a share of at the AP/Nizam Box office on its first day making it the biggest ever opener in Ravi Teja's career. The film collected a share of on its second day. The film earned a share of by the end of its first weekend at the worldwide Box office out of which was earned at AP/Nizam Box office. The film's trade was affected on 19 September 2014 due to the release of Aagadu but it picked up from the next day.

Trumpet lessons commenced in the early 1930s after receiving his first trumpet, made by Regent, bought at Werlein's a fixture in New Orleans music at that time. With that trumpet came 8 free lessons at All State Band on St. Charles Avenue, a local music venue owned by noted cornetist Johnny Wiggs. Later, lessons were taken with a local black Creole trumpeter, Manuel Manetta. The charge was 50 cents per lesson and it is recalled that when the assignment was completed the lesson was over, no time limit. The family owned a grocery and seafood market, as was common for many Italian immigrant families of the time.http://aifed.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/11/Contessa-Entellina-125th-Anniversary- Celebration1.pdfhttp://aifed.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Contessa- Entellina-126th-Anniversary-Celebration-2012-Program.pdf  Education  File:JOE - 8TH GRADE BEHRMAN HI BAND @1940.jpgTrumpeter Joseph Nicholas Macaluso Sr. circa 1940, Martin Behrman School Band, Algiers, Louisiana He attended local schools in (ALGIERS) New Orleans, including Martin Behrman School (Alice Harte, Principal) and Belleville Elementary (Edna Karr, Principal) in Algiers and later St. Aloysius High School in New Orleans (Bro.

Khapra kodinya 2. Baba pyare 3. Upper cot )The so-called \\"Buddhist Caves\\" are not actually caves, but three separate sites of rooms carved out of stone to be used as monks' quarters. These caves were carved from Emperor Ashoka's period up to 1st-4th century AD. Khapra Kodiya Caves The oldest, the Khapara Kodia caves, on the basis of scribbles and short cursive letters on the wall, are dated to 3rd-4th century BC during the Emperor Ashoka’s rule and are plainest of all cave groups. These caves are also known as Khangar Mahal. They were carved into living rock during the reign of Emperor Ashoka and are considered the earliest monastic settlement in the area. These caves are along the edge of the ancient Sudarshan Lake and little outside Uparkot fort, Northerly. They are carved out in an east-west longitudinal ridge. Caves are small in area. But, it has unique architecture of the water tanks design on western side and 'L' shaped residence. Caves were used by bhikkus during vassa period. After many years of use, they were abandoned because cracks within that let water seep into living quarters, rendering them unusable. Many accounts say that after this, the monks left for Maharashtra, where they went on to carve many similar and more elaborate structures. Khapara Kodia was damaged by later quarrying, and now only the highest story remains. Baba Pyare Caves Plan of Bava Pyara Caves Bava Pyara caves The Bava Pyara Caves are located near Modhimath, little outside Uparkot fort complex, southernly. These are much more intact than the Khapara Kodia caves. The caves were constructed during the Satavahana regime in 1st–2nd century A.D. According to the Xuanzang's travel account they were constricted in 1st century A.D. Northern group has four caves. South eastern group has chaitya and spacious court. Group has 13 caves modelled in three floors, carved in 45 m. (150 ft.) long, influenced by Buddhist architecture. Bava Pyara caves contains artworks of both Buddhism and Jainism. Uperkot Caves left Upper floor of the Uperkot caves These caves located at Uperkot beyond the 300 feet deep moat, close to Adi Kadi vav, were carved in 2nd–3rd century A.D. These caves have influence of Satvahana architecture with combination of Graeco- Scythian style. According to ASI \\"The cave group is in three tiers, with all members of each galleries shown in semi-relief, but only two storeys having regular floors. The upper floor has a deep tank, covered on three sides with verandahs and Kakshasana on west and north- west side. Lower floor has with corridor and pillars. The lower floor has exquisitely carved pillars whose base, shaft and capital carry unique decorative design.\\" These caves are gilded with beautiful pillars and entrances, water cisterns, horseshoe shaped chaitya windows, an assembly hall and cell for meditation.

A notable feature on the river within Forestmill is a horseshoe weir. This was built in 1711 by George Sorocold to direct water from the river through a sluice into the mill lade that fed the Gartmorn Dam reservoir. The weir was added to the schedule of British listed monuments in 1972. The Scottish poet Michael Bruce taught at the primary school for several months before his death in 1767. The Clackmannanshire Council website shows the hamlet with a population of 55 in 2009, making it the smallest settlement in the county.

Sexual misconduct and resignation On December 4, 2017, Pamela Lopez, a Sacramento lobbyist, alleged that Dababneh sexually assaulted her. According to Lopez, in 2016 Dababneh pushed her into a Las Vegas hotel bathroom, masturbated in front of her and urged her to touch him. \\"I felt the weight of a body push me into the restroom.\\" Dababneh has strongly denied the allegation, and his attorney Patricia L. Glaser, who also represents embattled film producer Harvey Weinstein, threatened to sue Lopez for defamation. \\"I affirmatively deny that this event ever happened,\\" said Dababneh. \\"I am saddened by this lobbyist's effort... for her own self-promotion.\\" Jessica Y. Barker, who was Dababneh's subordinate when they both worked in US Congressman Brad Sherman's District Office, also came forward and accused Dababneh of sexual harassment. According to Barker, Dababneh regularly spoke about his sexual exploits and made degrading comments about women. She said his behavior was the main factor in her decision to leave her job as a field representative for the congressman after 18 months. She said over the course of her tenure there that Dababneh frequently made inappropriate comments at work, including talking about his sexual habits and the attire of female staffers. Two friends confirmed to The Los Angeles Times that Barker regularly told them about Dababneh's behavior and that she said it made her feel uncomfortable. According to Barker, \\"Pamela and I aren't the only women that Matt has harassed. There are others and I have spoken to them.\\" On December 5, Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon announced that the Assembly Rules Committee would hire an outside law firm to investigate the incident described by Pamela Lopez, and Dababneh would temporarily step down as chair of the Assembly Banking and Finance Committee. On December 8, Dababneh announced that he would resign at the end of the month. He said he didn't feel pressure to resign because of the allegations, for which he maintains his innocence, but he said he simply no longer felt passionate about lawmaking and was ready for a change. After hearing of Dababneh's resignation, Lopez said this was only the beginning if he wanted to truly atone for his actions. She called on him to donate his 2018 campaign money (reported to be over a million dollars) to a rape crisis or trauma center. Lopez also announced that day she'd heard from several other women with allegations against Dababneh that ranged from sexual harassment to assault. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"Preliminary findings by an independent investigator hired by the Assembly Rules Committee substantiated Lopez’s allegation in June {2018}. The conclusion was based on interviews with Lopez and more than 50 witnesses. Dababneh also participated in the investigation.\\" Career Prior to being elected to the state assembly, for eight years he was the district chief of staff and senior aide to United States Congressman Brad Sherman of the 30th U.S. Congressional district. =2014 California State Assembly = Dababneh took office in January 2014, after winning the November 2013 election to complete the remaining 2014 term vacated by the 2013 resignation of Bob Blumenfield to represent Los Angeles City Council District 3.

He won a full term in 2014, and secured a spot in the general election of 2016 finishing as the top vote getter in June primary with 49.24% of the vote. This came after Dababneh received more than $350,000 in outside money in support of his re- election bid. Prior to the June 2016 primary he faced criticism from local Democratic activists for positions he had taken while in office.

Gypsum waste definition and types  Gypsum waste primarily consists of waste from gypsum boards, which are wall or ceiling panels made of a gypsum core between paper lining. Such boards are also referred to as sheetrock, plasterboards, drywall, wallboards and gyprock. Gypsum waste in some countries also consists of gypsum blocks and plaster, among others. Three main types of gypsum waste based on their origin can be distinguished:European Commission. http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n;_proj_id=4191 Retrieved 3 October 2013 * Gypsum waste from the manufacturing of gypsum products. :This waste, which arises at the industrial gypsum production sites, consists of rejects and non-spec materials generated during the manufacturing of gypsum products. The recycling of this waste stream is usually part of the waste avoidance activity of the gypsum plants. The waste is referred to as gypsum manufacturing or production waste and the recycled gypsum obtained from the recycling of this is known as “production waste derived recycled gypsum”.WRAP, Technical Report. Life Cycle Assessment of Plasterboard. 2008. http://www2.wrap.org.uk/downloads/Life_Cycle_Assessment_of_Plasterboard.2a99ccc6.5313.pdf Retrieved 26 September 2013. : * Gypsum waste from new construction. :Gypsum waste from new construction activities is typically a clean waste, and primarily consists of off-cuts of plasterboard (drywall, wallboard or gyprock) when the boards have been cut to fit the dimensions of the wall or ceiling. The waste may constitute 15% of the gypsum materials used on the site. Such waste is generally referred to as new construction gypsum waste, and can be reduced by ordering boards “made-to-measure”, but in most markets less than 10% of all orders are “made-to-measure”. * Gypsum waste from demolition and reconstruction :This waste arises when already installed plasterboards (drywalls, wallboards or gyprock boards), that usually have been installed many years ago, are taken out in connection with that the building is demolished or renovated. For this reason some refer to this waste as “old gypsum waste”, whereas the trade usually refer to this waste as “demolition waste”. Different from the two other types of gypsum waste described above, this type of gypsum waste from renovation, refurbishment and demolition works is more likely to present a certain degree of contamination, which can be in the form of nails, screws, wood, insulation, wall coverings etc. For this waste to be recyclable it is required that the equipment processing the waste is capable of separating such contamination from the gypsum to arrive at a pure recycled gypsum. New construction and demolition gypsum waste is both arising after the gypsum products have left the manufacturing sites, and together these two waste types are referred to as post consumer gypsum waste. The recycled gypsum obtained from this is known as post-consumer recycled gypsum.  Gypsum recycling process  Gypsum waste can be turned into recycled gypsum by processing the gypsum waste in such a way that the contaminants are removed and the paper facing of the plasterboard is separated from the gypsum core through mechanical processes including grinding and sieving in specialised equipment. Gypsum waste such as gypsum blocks and plaster do not require the removal of paper, as they are not made with paper from the beginning. It is typical for the gypsum recyclers to accept up to 3 per cent of contamination from other materials. The professional recyclers are capable of handling gypsum waste with nails and screws, wall coverings etc.  Why should gypsum waste be recycled?  Gypsum materials consist of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O). Sulfate-reducing bacteria convert sulfates to toxic hydrogen sulphide gas; they are killed by exposure to air, but the moist, airless, carbon-containing environment in a landfill is a good habitat for them. So gypsum put into landfill will decompose, releasing up to a quarter its weight in hydrogen sulfide.Recycling Council of British Columbia. Why can't I put my leftover gyproc/drywall in the garbage? Retrieved from Moreover, methanogenic bacteria also thrive in such an environment, and convert the paper in the plasterboard to methane gas which is a potent greenhouse gas.Environmental Protection Agency. State of Ohio. Fact Sheet: Methane and Hydrogen Sulfide Gases at Cⅅ Landfills. Retrieved from M.A.K. Khalil. Non- greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Annual Review of Energy and the Environment. Vol. 24: 645-661 (Volume publication date November 1999) Recycling gypsum waste also reduces the need for the quarrying and production of virgin gypsum raw materials. Recycling one ton of the ordinary gypsum will save 1,000 pounds of black alkali, 1 ton of lactic acid and 500 kwh of energy. Recycling one metric ton of gypsum will save 28 kwh of energy and 4 pounds of aluminium.  Rationale for choosing closed loop recycling  Gypsum is fully and eternally recyclable EUROGYPSUM, Environmental and Raw Material Committee. Factsheet on: What is gypsum? http://www.eurogypsum.org/_uploads/dbsattachedfiles/whatisgypsum.pdf Retrieved 26 September 2013. and, as a consequence, gypsum waste is one of the few construction materials for which closed loop recycling is possible. Closed loop recycling of gypsum products involves the collection and processing of the gypsum waste, and the delivery of the obtained recycled gypsum to the manufacturer of gypsum products. It is therefore essential that the recycled gypsum achieves a pre-determined quality suitable for the manufacturing of new gypsum products. Presently there is no European or American standard pre- determining the recycled gypsum's quality and the criteria vary from plant to plant. By choosing closed loop recycling the need for manufacturers to acquire virgin gypsum is reduced, contributing therefore to promote a sustainable manufacturing process. The most advanced plants, and most of these are found in the Nordic countries in Europe, have substituted up to 30 per cent of virgin gypsum raw materials with recycled gypsum.Saint-Gobain Gyproc Finland. Letter written by the Plant Director. June 2013  Gypsum recycling in Europe  Gypsum recycling in Europe was started by the Danish company Gypsum Recycling International A/S in Denmark, in 2001. After a few years the recycling system received waste from approximately 85 per cent of all public civic amenity/recycling centres and a recycling rate of 60 per cent of all gypsum waste was achieved.WRAP. Plasterboard Case Study. International practice in plasterboard recycling: Denmark. Gypsum Recycling International A/S. The system has been exported to cover other European countries. Today also new recyclers have emerged and gypsum recycling systems have been introduced in more countries, like the UK, France and in the Benelux, but the highest recycling rates for gypsum waste are still found in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

One of the drivers for the project is the target set by the European Union to achieve that 70 per cent of construction and demolition waste is recycled by 2020.The European Parliament and The Council of the European Union.

Gypsum recycling in North America  Urban Gypsum Recycling Urban Gypsum is a division of Laneco, Inc. and provides gypsum wallboard recycling services for the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This recovered gypsum is then distributed to agricultural and industrial customers in the region keeping the wallboard from ending up in the landfill. New West Gypsum Recycling began recycling of wallboard waste in Canada in 1985. The recycled material is a blend of pre- and post-consumer, wet and dry gypsum waste that is a source of raw material for use in the manufacture of new drywall products. Gypsum Agri-cycle is one of the first companies to recycle drywall in the USA. Gypsum Agri-cycle is another North American recycler of new construction drywall located in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania does not allow Gypsum Agri-cycle to recycle demolition drywall. Zanker Recycling began recycling gypsum in the form of sheetrock in 1999. In the recycling process, materials such as wood, metals, and trash are removed on-site where a dozer is used to crush the materials. American Gypsum Recycling American Gypsum Recycling was founded in 2018 by Chris Stapleton.

He was born Anthony Lee to Philomena Lee in Ireland, and spent his first years of life in a convent before being adopted by Marge and Doc Hess of St. Louis, Missouri. The issues surrounding his adoption are controversial, as part of a program of forced adoptions practised by some Catholic religious orders in Ireland at the time, and the story of that early part of his life was later told in British journalist Martin Sixsmith's book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee and in the film Philomena. Personal life Hess's birth mother became pregnant at age 18 at a local carnival by a man named John who worked for the post office. She was disowned by her father and sent to Sean Ross Abbey, a refuge for unwed mothers, which was operated by the Sisters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary in Roscrea, County Tipperary, Ireland. After she gave birth to Hess, she was able to be with her child until she was 22 and he was three while living in the abbey. As was common practice in Ireland at the time, the nuns sold him to a Catholic family from the United States. Lee did not know where her son was sent by the nuns after she left the Abbey after being pressured into signing the adoption papers. Hess grew up in the Midwest and was raised in a Catholic family. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1974 and earned a J.D. degree at George Washington University. Hess made three visits to Ireland to try to find his mother but was unsuccessful in persuading the nuns to divulge any information. He requested that his ashes be buried at Roscrea in the hope that his mother would be able to find his grave. Hess never learned who his mother was. He died from complications of AIDS, although this was not mentioned at the memorial service held for him. Hess's male lover for the last 15 years of his life was Steve Dahllof. Dahllof credited the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee with \\"about a three out of 10, in terms of accuracy\\", while the movie Philomena, \\"in accuracy of spirit, is 10 out of 10.\\" Career Hess became deputy chief legal counsel to the Republican National Committee, eventually rising to chief legal counsel. He was an important figure in the redistricting battles of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and was admired for his integrity and pursuit of justice on this issue. Controversy The programme of forced adoptions by some ecclesiastical authorities in Ireland and elsewhere during the 1950s has raised considerable debate, and the Michael Hess case has further highlighted this. Much of the paperwork relating to this programme was later destroyed and access to adoption archives has been cut off. Film A film portraying Hess's adoption and his mother's later search for him was released in 2013. Philomena, directed by Stephen Frears and based on the book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee, starred Judi Dench as his mother; Sean Mahon as Hess, and Steve Coogan as Martin Sixsmith, the journalist who helped Philomena Lee identify her son. Although Philomena never actually went to the USA (as she is shown to do in the film), the 'disclaimer' at the end of the movie (\\"no similarity is to be inferred between characters depicted and real persons\\") makes clear that 'dramatic licence' was employed to give the (true) story more impact for audiences.

In the original species description by Asa Gray in 1883, Aquilegia longissima is distinguished from the shorter-spurred golden columbine Aquilegia chrysantha based on the extremely long spur over 10 cm long, narrow spatulate petals, and very slender spurs that usually hang straight down. The plants typically flower in the fall after monsoon rains and are found in oak-pine-juniper woodlands in shaded canyons near intermittent streams or on talus slopes. William Trelease hypothesized in 1883 that the most likely pollinator of A. longissima would be the giant sphinx moth, Cocytius antaeus. The giant sphinx moth is a rare stray in west Texas and has been collected in Big Bend National Park near long-spur columbine populations; however, the common pollinators are likely large hawkmoths in the genera Manduca and Agrius with tongue lengths from 9–14 cm long. Hybridization is common in the genus Aquilegia and populations with intermediate spur lengths from 7–9 cm are found near some long-spur columbine populations. In a multivariate analyses of floral characteristics, the intermediate plants with spurs 7–9 cm long cluster with the more common golden columbine. One population with intermediate spur lengths is found at Cattail Falls in Big Bend National Park.

In 1699 a new Polish king Augustus II disbanded the Cossack militia and signed a peace treaty with Ottoman Turkey. Cossacks were angered by this situation, and in 1702 colonel (polkovnyk) Paliy started an open rebellion against the crown, the last of the major Cossack uprisings against the Commonwealth. Together with a number of other Cossack polkovnyks, Paliy and his rebels captured Bila Tserkva, Fastiv, Nemirov and a few other towns. Rebellious Cossacks massacred their traditional enemies - Polish szlachta, Catholic priests and Jews - in the area they controlled. On October 17, 1702 Paliy and his Cossacks were defeated by the Polish army under hetman Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski near the town of Berdychiv and later at Nemirov and at Webricze in February 1703. Paliy's last stand was at Bila Tserkva. Russian Tsar Peter I and left-bank Ukraine ataman Ivan Mazepa, who were allied with Poland against Sweden at the time, intervened diplomatically, arranging a ceasefire, and ordered Paliy to surrender Bila Tserkva, but he and his men refused. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar Peter I to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of right-bank Ukraine. Fearing the popularity of Paliy, Mazepa had him exiled to Siberia in 1705.

The Castle  thumb Bánffy Castle (or Bonţida Bánffy Castle) is an architectonic Baroque monument situated in Bonţida, a village in the vicinity of Cluj-Napoca, Romania. It was built during the 15th century and was owned by the Bánffy family (of which Miklós Bánffy was a member). The owner is Katalin Banffy. The castle was desecrated during World War II by German troops and neglected by the communist regime in Romania; it is currently being restored by the Transylvania Trust as a cultural center. Through the presence of the Transylvania Trust and the Institute of Historic Building Conservation, who are the organizers of the International Built Heritage Conservation Training Centre set up within the Castle, the high quality restoration and long term protection can be ensured. Electric Castle Festival is supporting the restoration process by donating an amount of the money earned from the tickets sale.  Impact  The festival generates revenue for the Bonțida community as a large number of locals convert their homes into hostels to provide accommodation for the festival goers. Also, some locals provide parking spaces for the participants' cars and cheap alternatives for food and drinks. The organisers have raised money for the Bánffy Castle's restoration, and managed to restore the roof and build flooring, through the ongoing Give me a Brick campaign, encouraging festival goers to donate \\"bricks\\" or \\"mortar\\" through the festival bars. The \\"bricks\\" and \\"mortar\\" are sums of money equivalent to an actual brick and an actual bucket of mortar. Through the continued implication of festival sponsors, the sports ground for the local school was restored and furniture was bought for classrooms.  Awards  2013 - After the first edition in 2013, the festival was nominated by European Festivals Awards for the Best New Festival and Best Medium Size Festival titles, later on being shortlisted at the Best Medium Size Festival among festivals such as Melt!, Balaton Sound, I Love Techno or Volt. 2014 - The festival was again shortlisted among the best European festivals by European Festivals Awards 2015 - Electric Castle was shortlisted for the third time for the Best Medium Sized Festival by European Festivals Awards 2017 - Electric Castle was shortlisted for the fourth time for the Best Medium Sized Festival by European Festivals Awards 2017 - Electric Castle has received the award for Best Camping Award, by European Festivals Awards 2018 - Electric Castle was shortlisted for the fifth time for the Best Medium Sized Festival by European Festivals Awards 2018 - Electric Castle has received the award for Best Food & Drinks Award, by European Festivals Awards 2019 - Electric Castle was shortlisted for Green Operations, by European Festivals Awards 2019 - Electric Castle received the award for Best Medium Sized Festival by European Festivals Awards See also *List of electronic music festivals  References   External links  * Electric Castle Festival Official Website *Electric Castle 2015 - Official After Movie * Electric Castle 2014 - After Movie * Electric Castle 2013 - After Movie * Electric Castle 2015 Review Music festivals established in 2013 2013 establishments in Romania Tourist attractions in Cluj County Electronic music festivals in Romania Summer events in Romania ","title":"Electric Castle"},{"id":"41186350","text":"The Romance of Maoriland was a 1930 New Zealand film, intended to be New Zealand's first \\"talkie\\" film with Ted Coubray’s Coubraytone sound system, though also having intertitles.

It is found on the lower shore as part of a diverse community in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Description Spongites yendoi is a hard, encrusting species of coralline algae. Like other species it contains chlorophyll and uses photosynthesis to synthesize carbohydrates. The cell walls of the algae contain deposits of calcium carbonate which give it its firm consistency. The thallus of Spongites yendoi is relatively thin and is mainly composed of filaments of small, squarish cells. The lowermost layer is up to eight filaments thick and these cells are mostly elongate. The cells are often fused. The tetrasporangial conceptacles are elliptical and have a single pore. Old conceptacles do not become buried as the thallus grows. The colour varies but may be some shade of grey or chalky white. Its range in South Africa extends further north than that of the pear limpet Scutellastra cochlear and when ungrazed by this limpet it is thicker and more knobbly. Distribution and habitat Spongites yendoi is found in the southeastern Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific. Its range includes South Africa, Réunion, the Comoroes, Mayotte and Mauritius, and extends to China, Indonesia and Australia. It is also found on the coasts of the North, South and Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It grows on rocks and on benthic organisms in the lower parts of the intertidal zone. Ecology On the rocky coasts of South Africa, Spongites yendoi is the main algal component of a community of organisms commonly found in the low intertidal zone. A thin layer of this alga tends to cover rock surfaces and seaweeds grow as epiphytes on top. Both the coralline alga and the seaweeds are grazed by the pear limpet and other herbivores. Twice a year, Spongites yendoi sloughs off its upper layers but nevertheless seaweeds soon grow again on the exposed surface which is usually kept clean by the feeding activities of the herbivores. Sloughing is probably a means of eliminating old reproductive structures and damaged surface cells, and reducing the risk of surface penetration by burrowing organisms. The relationship between the pear limpet and Spongites yendoi could be considered a form of mutualism. The limpet gets 85% of its nutritional needs by grazing on the coralline alga and leaves it in thin sheets with a damaged surface. The limpet is not present in the north of its range and in these areas the algal sheets are much thicker and flabbier, and develop protuberances. It has been observed that the thin form of the alga grows laterally five times as fast as the thick form and is less likely to be attacked by burrowing organisms, so the association between the two organisms may be mutually beneficial. The pear limpet tends to be covered with a marine lichen Pyrenocollema spp., and Spongites yendoi often grows on top of this. It also grows on the shells of Scutellastra argenvillei, Patella granatina, Oxystele sinensis and Turbo spp., and around the colonial mollusc Dendropoma corallinaceum. A thin layer of this alga may also line tidal pools higher up the shore.

The team hopes to develop and land their spacecraft, the Lunar Lion on the Moon. The team is student run under the direction of Dr. Alexander Rattner, a mechanical engineering professor at Penn State's Multiscale Thermal Fluids and Energy. The team, which is privately funded, secured its first $2.5 million, most of which was internal funding, to get the project started. The team was formerly a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize competition, but has since withdrawn.http://news.psu.edu/story/367698/2015/08/31/academics/penn-state- lunar-lion-keeps-eyes-moon Spacecraft The Lunar Lion is the spacecraft currently being developed to reach the Moon. The craft is planned to be sent on a commercial launch vehicle which will send it into space and place it on a trajectory to the Moon. It is then expected to make a controlled descent to the lunar surface where it will transmit high-resolution photographic images and video to the mission operations center at Penn State. The craft will then take off and fly a short distance to a second landing site while streaming the event live. Testing and Development =Phase 0= At the end of October 2013, the team successfully finished Phase 0, a series of tests that validated the rocket-testing procedure. The phase included the development of contingency plans, safety plans, and thorough rocket testing procedure. As part of this phase, full rocket firing was simulated and investigated. Test plans must meet the Environmental Health and Safety Standards. =Phase 1= Phase 1 included testing of combustible liquid fuel, a NASA-provided pencil thruster, and custom thrusters developed at Penn State. =Phase 2= The initial liquid bipropellant part of this phase was completed towards the end of summer 2014. The team characterized and tested hydrogen peroxide monopropellant thrusters. These were used on the first flight vehicle the team constructed, a prototype called Puma. Each of the four 100 lbf engines were characterized to generate a thrust profile which was used for Puma's flight testing. Puma was developed for constrained vertical flight, with guide cables restricting motion to a single axis. Static testing of Puma began during the summer of 2016, and a constrained flight test was conducted on October 22, 2016.

Early life and family Helder was born Emma Jane Holder in 1890 in the Easton district of Bristol. Her father, Thomas, a dairyman at the time, became landlord of a nearby public house where a young Helder would sing to entertain the regulars. Helder's musical range—from C3 to C5—attracted attention from an early age. She soon began formal music lessons, at which point she changed her name to avoid confusion with a classmate. Her aunt, who was housekeeper to the music hall star Harry Lauder, made arrangements for Helder to train at the Guildhall School of Music with Charles Tinney. Helder also later trained with Charles Santley. Santley described her voice as a \\"natural, pure tenor voice of great beauty and power.\\"Patricia O'Toole, \\"Why Don't I Feel Included in these Musics, or Matters\\" in Praxial Music Education : Reflections and Dialogues: Reflections and Dialogues, p. 302. Singing career and later life By 1908, Helder was recording for Pathé, and in 1909 made her first appearance in an opera at the Queen's Hall, London. In 1911, she signed a recording contract with HMV, and by 1913 her international fame was such that she is said to have travelled to the United States in order to sing at a millionaire's private party.\\"GIRL TENOR TO SING HERE.; Ruby Helder Makes the Trip Especially for Mrs. August Belmont\\" in The New York Times, April 2, 1913. She sang at venues across the United States, and between 1916 and 1917 pursued music studies at Grinnell College. Helder later toured the United States and Canada with John Philip Sousa and his band. On July 12, 1920, Helder married the American architect and artist Chesley Bonestell. The married couple then undertook a tour of Italy. At this point, however, Helder's popularity was in decline, and there were no recordings made of her after 1921. They returned to the United States in 1927, settling in Berkeley, California. She worked there as a music teacher for some years.Berkeley Daily Gazette, March 16, 1932, p. 7. Helder retired from singing in 1935, and died on November 21, 1938, aged just 48, at the Highland Hotel, Hollywood, after a long battle with alcoholism.

History NSET was founded on June 18, 1993 and registered at the District Administration Office, Kathmandu on April 28, 1994 and at the Social Welfare Council on August 10, 1998. Purpose NSET was founded with the vision of \\"Earthquake Safe Communities in Nepal by 2020\\". Activities In order to combat the growing risks posed by a devastating earthquake in Nepal in the near future, NSET seeks to make builders and citizens aware of affordable construction techniques that can significantly reduce seismic risk. Currently, 80 per cent of new buildings in Nepal are built informally, without engineering expertise. NSET's activities target the informal builders of such edifices: the organisation conducts demonstrations using a 'Shake Table', a tool that shows the effects of an earthquake on scale models of two buildings, one built using traditional methods and one incorporating earthquake engineering. The Shake Table demonstration has been given to builders, masons, engineers, policy makers and health and disaster response personnel and is now being used in India, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan as well. NSET also retrofits schools and other buildings in Nepal to make them more earthquake proof and runs earthquake drills for organisations such as hospitals, to allow them to perfect their disaster response techniques. Association Memberships NSET is a founding member of the following associations: *Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network (ADRRN) *Coalition for Global School Safety (COGSS) *Disaster Preparedness Network Nepal (DPNet) *International Live Lessons Transfer Network (TeLLNet) NSET is also a member of the following associations: *International Association for Earthquake Engineering (IAEE) *World Seismic Safety Initiative (WSSI) *Kirtipur Volunteer Society See also * 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake * 1988 Nepal earthquake * Disaster risk reduction * Earthquake engineering * Seismic retrofit * Seismic risk * Society of Nepali Architects References Further reading Bothara, J.

He has been sentenced to 15.5 years in the Czech Republic and 35 years in South Africa. He became rich through criminal activity during the 1990s and was considered one of the richest people in the Czech Republic. Krejčíř fled from the country shortly after being arrested in June 2005 and resided in the Seychelles. In 2012, he was sentenced in absentia to eight years of imprisonment for fraud totalling CZK 108,000,000. In November, 2013, he was arrested and charged with kidnapping and attempted murder in South Africa. The trial started in May 2014.http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Krejcir-trial-starts-20140508 In August 2015, he was found guilty of attempted murder, assault and kidnapping, among other things. Other trials are still in progress. In Johannesburg, on 23 February 2016, Radovan Krejčíř has been sentenced to 35-years in jail.http://zpravy.aktualne.cz/zahranici/vinen-jihoafricky-soud-vynesl-prvni- rozsudek-nad-krejcirem/r~67c3deb24a4911e5b286002590604f2e/  Biography  His criminal activities began in the early 1990s, following the Velvet Revolution. He co-founded the company Corado and amassed great wealth during the Czech voucher privatization. His activities and companies were monitored by the police since the mid-1990s, due to suspicion of illegal money transfers. In June 2005, the police raided his luxury villa in Černošice and arrested him in association with a planned murder of a customs officer, fraud and criminal conspiracy. Krejčíř fled the house during the police intervention, which later led to the resignation of the Czech Police President Jiří Kolář. In September, 2005, Interpol traced him and his family in the Seychelles. In April 2007, he moved to South Africa under the false name Egbert Jules Savy. He was arrested and taken into custody at O. R. Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. The Czech Republic started negotiations about his extradition with the South African authorities, however, South Africa did not allow the extradition, as it was alleged he had paid bribes to the necessary judge. He is wanted for tax fraud and conspiracy to murder in the Czech Republic. In South Africa, Krejčíř established contacts with the local criminal scene. He himself became a target of an attack in July 2013, when his car was hit by a remote-control gun. He figured in the murder investigation of crime boss Cyril Beeka, who was killed in Cape Town in 2011. The South African media associate him with several other murders in the local underworld, and also the luring, abduction and murder of Stuttgart-based Gemballa automobile tuning factory's founder Uwe Gemballa. According to one report, Krejčíř was allegedly bringing money into South Africa in Gemballa cars. Krejčíř was convicted for drug dealing and serves his sentence in Gauteng's Kgosi Mampuru Prison. On 31 March 2017, his Seychellois citizenship was revoked.http://www.statehouse.gov.sc/news.php?news_id=3387  Attempted prison escape  A number of illegal items were discovered on 26 September 2015 in an apparent raid of a number of prison cells including that of Krejčíř. Amongst the items found were a pistol, ammunition, a knife, an item that appeared to be a Taser, a pepper spray gun, screwdriver steel blade, ten cellphones, a memory stick, a diary which contained the names of witnesses and investigators in his cases and a sketch showing a detailed map of the prison building. The escape was to take place at his next court appearance in October 2015. It was revealed that a staggering R246 million ($18 million USD) had been made available to ensure the smooth escape of Krejčíř from prison. Three prison warders were paid R1.5 million to help expedite the prison break. Impeccable sources close to the investigation revealed that the three warders have already been identified and their arrest is imminent. Krejčíř has been moved to an underground isolation cell after it has been established that a helicopter was going to be used in the daring raid to free him. Some of the R246 million was used to pay for this helicopter to spirit Krejčíř away once he had escaped. A part of the money was also to be used to pay all the people, including the police, who were involved in the plan to spring him out of jail and some would have been used to pay for the landing rights for a chartered plane to fly him out of the country. Judge of Tribunal in Johannesburg Colin Lamont, condemned him on 23 February, 2016 to 35 years in jail. In popular culture Gangster Ka a Czech film directed by Jan Pachl, is inspired by the story of Radovan Krejčíř. The movie premiered in 2015.

Newberry. In the early 1970s, the mall was expanded with a new wing ending in Sears. The addition of this wing required the demolition of the Edgewater Gulf Hotel. Sears opened in July 1972. J. J. Newberry closed in 1979 and became JCPenney the same year. McCrory Stores operated a dime store in the mall until 1996. A year later, the mall underwent a major expansion and renovation program that included the addition of McRae's (now Belk) as an anchor, along with the expansion of the JCPenney and Sears stores. A second story was added to the Sears, while the JCPenney store was expanded into a space previously occupied by a Jitney Jungle supermarket. The Gayfers chain was sold to Dillard's in 1998. The mall was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Sears was the first store to reopen after the hurricane. Dillard's, which suffered the most damage from the hurricane, was rebuilt and did not reopen until 2008. In June 2017, Sears announced that its store at the mall would close in September 2017, dropping the number of anchors from 4 to 3.

By 1903 the homestead had been built using Cypress-pine and a herd of 40,000 cattle were supported on the property. Ivan Egoriffe, a Russian, was appointed as station manager at about the same time. Known as Ivan the Terrible he treated Aboriginal workers cruelly and many left the property. Eventually a few returned and tried to assassinate Egoriffe, but instead killed another man. Egoriffe had the man accused of the killing hung outside the homestead. Both Frederick Bradshaw and Egoriffe were murdered by Aborigines near Port Keats in 1905 when two men boarded their ship and killed them along with five of their companions in a revenge attack. The bodies of the men were buried on the run atop an escarpment known as The Tombs. Joseph Bradshaw spent his last years on the property which entered a period of decline and was deserted by his backers. He hired another manager, named Byres, who replaced the old homestead which had become riddled with white ants. The property was acquired by Patrick Quilty, the son of Tom Quilty, in 1937. Quilty Snr. owned Glenore Station and Euroka Springs Station, both of which were passed onto his sons. Prior to his death in 1938 Patrick Quilty and his brother Tom acquired Bradshaw, Coolibah and Bedford Downs Station. Much of the property was acquired by the Department of Defence in 1995 to form the Bradshaw Field Training Area used by the Australian Army and the US Army. The training area occupies an area of .

Early life As she stated in her interview (http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/her-plays-go- places/article5092888.ece) in The Hindu dated 14 September 2013, playwriting came naturally to her at a very young age. Her first tryst with writing was in school when she won a national short story writing competition. In her high school in Vellore, Ida Scudder School, she wrote a musical for the annual play production, finding it easier to write one than to find an appropriate play in the library as her principal had initially suggested. She graduated from Women's Christian College, Chennai. It was here that she began to explore this gift further…being an all women's college, they had no male actors and so she wrote a play titled Seven for a Secret that had an all-women cast. It went on to win the Best Script prize and the Best Audience Response at an inter- collegiate theatre festival. She worked as a reporter in Bangalore doing food and play reviews. She then did an MA in English Literature at the University of Madras. She worked as a copywriter and then as a technical writer. Life as a playwright When she scribbled her first script on the back of a notebook in school, it was simply her idea of what she thought a play should look like. Yet, she says, the form came naturally. She wrote her second full length script while studying at Women's Christian College. But she learnt the fundamentals of playwriting during a workshop by Mahesh Dattani and was later trained by the Royal Court Theatre in London.She says about her experience in her interview with 'The Hindu' \\"I learnt how drama is action. Cause and effect. Your left brain and right brain have to work together.” In WCC she had to write a play with no male actors in it. So she wrote a play with 7 girls in it titled \\"Seven for a Secret \\"and it was this play that got her into a workshop with the Royal Court Theatre, London. The play was performed in Chennai and it won the Best Script prize and Best Audience Response prize. She participated in a playwriting workshop by Mahesh Dattani and the play she wrote at the end of this titled 'Only Women' had a rehearsed reading at the British Council. She also wrote a monologue titled 'We are Water' that was aired on BBC radio in Sept 2003. After taking up various other jobs, she realised that her passion was in theatre, especially writing scripts. So she approached the Royal Court Theatre again. This time she sent them a play that she had been working on. It was the original draft of 'The Long Way Home'. 'The Long Way Home', found its way to the country's most prestigious stages, from NCPA and Prithvi in Mumbai to the Museum Theatre in Chennai, last year. She had become a mother by then, and so she explored the dynamics between a mother and daughter.\\" The play evolved as she realised her strength was dialogue. The play 'The Long Way Home' was produced and staged by Evam entertainment and directed by Karthik Kumar. It starred the talented dancer- actor Anita Ratnam. The role was so authentic that every performance ended with people walking up to her and saying, \\"You're just like my mom\\". The play was shown in Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore. Shekinah says, \\"I realized that even if I'm writing about the small world I know, a domineering south Indian mother isn't too different from a mother at the other end of the world. As playwrights we have to fall in love with creating believable characters.\\" Her biggest and most acclaimed work till date has been the hugely successful \\"Ali J\\". Ali J began with a real story. Her brother is a lawyer who works with a human rights organisation in Mumbai. He told her about a young man who was imprisoned because drugs were planted in his bag. The man spent 10 years in a Mauritius prison, and then was moved to Mumbai. He's still in prison. Around the same time, evam asked her to write them a monologue for 'The Fringe'. \\"They originally wanted one on Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and realizing how little Indian history she knew, she began to read extensively on the subject.\\" After six months of reading, she decided to morph the two subjects. \\"The actual writing took just as long as it took her to type.” Ali J, produced by evam entertainment premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews and a four star review from The Scotsman. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country. The story works on two levels. It's about a guy in his 30s imprisoned in a cell in Chennai who is on death row for a crime he did not commit. It's about how circumstances and people shape his vision. She adds, \\"The point is to capture the idea that a single event can change the course of your life. All of us are acted on by so many influences – childhood, love, jealousy…. Great historical figures were no different. Their decisions are so influenced by personal egos, ambitions, and little distractions. Ali J by evam premiered at the recent Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and ran for 25 days garnering rave reviews. It will open the NCPA Centrestage Festival in Mumbai next, after which it will tour the country. Talking about her inspiration in her interview with \\"The Indian Express\\" on 25 October 2013 Jacob says, \\"I read as widely as possible– my favorite playwrights include Alan Bennet for the brilliant way in which he captures miniature shifts of mood and the textured dynamics of relationships, also Tom Stoppard and David Mamet. And of course the immortal Shakespeare,\\" she says. According to Jacob, good theatre is like a good democracy, 'by the people, of the people, and for the people'. She writes what she would like to watch as an audience. She enjoys watching plays that are rooted in her world. Theatre should be like an ongoing dialogue between the audience and the actors. Shekinah Jacob began her own theatre group called Open House Productions, mainly to combine her two loves- entertaining, thought-provoking theatre that also generates income for charitable causes. The uniqueness of this theatre company is that operates on a Robin Hood model, funded by corporates and well-wishers, while most of the revenue from ticket sales go to deserving local NGOs in every locality that they perform in. Open House Productions feel that artists should be rewarded for their time and talent and they try to pay every performer as generously as possible. In an interview in 2015, playwright Naren Weiss told India-West that his play Censored came to him after Jacob's Ali J had been banned in multiple cities across India. The play was later shot as a sketch by the Stray Factory and went viral in India. Two years ago Shekinah Jacob won the Charles Wallace Scholarship and acquired a Masters in Writing for Performance with a Distinction at Goldsmiths, University of London. Her course and exposure to cutting-edge theatre on London's stages was a huge learning experience and she has brought all of that back to the second innings of Open House Theatre Productions that was on a brief break during her years in the U.K. They are now back with The Christmas Shootout, a comedy for the festive season, beginning a national tour in December 2016 in all the four metros. They are also going international this year with an eighth show in Dubai, to reach a total audience of over 5500 people. =Play Ali J= Part Bollywood romance, part social commentary on the after-effects of the partitioning of India, this perfectly pitched play by Shekinah Jacob, produced by Evam Theatre, never lets the weighty issues it tackles overshadow a heartfelt personal story. The writing is rich with humour and humanity, and TK Karthik's engaging performance brings Ali's warm and welcoming character to life.The Scotsman – http://www.edinburgh-festivals.com/blog/2013/08/08/theatre-review-ali-j/ – \\"Hot show pick...\\" 4 stars The Scotsman – \\"Hot show pick...\\" 4 stars The play is both heartfelt and cerebral as it paints a picture of an India still living in the wake of brutal partition following independence, simultaneously telling the story of one man and millions of people.
