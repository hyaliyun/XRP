P39 The Society's aim was to gain and spread knowledge related to science and history and they built a large collection for this purpose. The geologist John Phillips was employed as the Society's first keeper of its museum. In 1828 the Society was given, by royal grant, some of the grounds of St Mary's Abbey including the ruins of the abbey.P176 On this land the Society constructed a number of buildings including the Yorkshire Museum built to house the Society's geological and archaeological collections and opened in 1830.

Due to the harm done to the animal subjects, this testing is opposed by animal rights activists and others. Cosmetic animal testing is banned in Colombia, the European Union, United Kingdom, India, Israel, and Norway. Definition Using animal testing in the development of cosmetics may involve testing either a finished product or the individual ingredients of a finished product on animals, often rabbits, as well as mice, rats, and other animals. Cosmetics can be defined as products applied to the body in various ways in order to enhance the body's appearance or to cleanse the body. This includes all hair products, makeup, nail products and soaps. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) continues to endorse animal testing methods. Re-using existing test data obtained from previous animal testing is generally not considered to be cosmetic testing on animals; however, the acceptability of this to opponents of testing is inversely proportional to how recent the data is. Methods Methods of testing cosmetics on animals include many different tests that are categorized differently based on which areas the cosmetics will be used for. One new ingredient in any cosmetic product used in these tests could lead to the deaths of at least 1,400 animals. Dermal penetration: Rats are mostly used in this method that analyzes moment of a chemical, and the penetration of the chemical in the bloodstream. Dermal penetration is a method that creates a better understanding of skin absorption. Skin sensitisation: This is a method that determines if a chemical causes an allergic reaction. The chemical adjuvant is injected to boost the immune system. In the past it was performed on guinea pigs, and applied on a shaved patch of skin. Substances are assessed based on appearance of skin. Acute toxicity: This test is used to determine danger of exposure to a chemical by mouth, skin, or inflammation. Rats and mice are injected in lethal dose 50% (LD50). This test can cause animal convulsions, loss of motor function, and seizures. Draize test: This is a method of testing that may cause irritation or corrosion to the skin or eye on animals, dermal sensitization, airway sensitization, endocrine disruption, and (which refers to the lethal dose which kills 50% of the treated animals). Skin corrosivity or irritation: This method of test assesses the potential of a substance causing irreversible damage to the skin. It is typically performed on rabbits and involves putting chemicals on a shaved patch of skin. This determines the level of damage to the skin that includes itching, inflammation, swelling, etc. Alternatives Cosmetics manufacturers who do not test on animals may now use in vitro screens to test for endpoints which can determine potential risk to humans with a very high sensitivity and specificity. Companies such as CeeTox in the USA, recently acquired by Cyprotex, specialize in such testing and organizations like the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing (CAAT), PETA and many other organizations advocate the use of in vitro and other non-animal tests in the development of consumer products. By using safe ingredients from a list of 5,000 which have already been tested in conjunction with modern methods of cosmetics testing, the need for tests using animals are negated. EpiSkin‚Ñ¢, EpiDerm‚Ñ¢, and SkinEthic are each composed of artificial human skin as an option for alternative testing. Artificial skin can imitate the reaction actual human skin will have to a product and the chemicals it contains and can be altered to mimic different skin types and ages. For example, using UV light on EpiSkin can cause it to resemble older skin and adding melanocytes will turn the skin a darker color. This helped create a spectrum of different skin colors that are then used to compare the results of sunblock on a different variety of people. To address potential issues with other parts of the human body, research companies such as NOTOX have developed a synthetic model of the human liver, which is the main organ to detox the body, in order to test harmful ingredients and chemicals to see if the liver can detox those elements. Research companies can also use body parts and organs taken from animals slaughtered for the meat industry to perform tests such as the Bovine Corneal Opacity and Permeability Test and Isolated Chicken Eye Test. Lab-grown tissues are now being used to test chemicals in makeup products. MatTek is one of the companies that do this. It sells small amounts of skin cells to companies to test their products on them. Some of these companies are those that make laundry detergent, makeup, toilet bowl cleaner, anti-aging creams, and tanning lotion. Without these tissues, companies would be testing their products on living animals. Lab-grown tissues are a great alternative to testing harmful products on animals. One lab was able to grow 11 different types of tissues in a petri dish. The downfall was that the tissues were not fully functional on their own, in fact, many of these tissues only resembled tiny parts of an actual sized human organ, most of which were too small to transplant into humans. The bright side is that they were a great learning experience for many of the students researching there. This technology could potentially be great, but it was a major downfall, 'Ministomachs that took about nine weeks to cultivate in a petri dish formed \\"oval-shaped, hollow structures\\". Many companies have not made the switch to cruelty-free yet for many reasons, one of them being the time it takes for lab-grown tissues to be useable. Animals on the other hand, can mature quickly. Rats, for example, have a much quicker growth rate \\"From birth to adult, rats take about three weeks to mature and begin fending for themselves. The rodents reach sexual maturity in about five weeks and begin mating soon after to produce the next generation to start the rat life cycle over again\\". On top of the extremely short time it takes a rat to mature, they can provide us with a complete set of organ systems, not just a paper-thin sheet of cells. Rats can also reproduce, and they do so at a very fast pace \\"In general, rats produce about seven offspring per litter and can reach up to 14 at times. Typical gestation periods last only a few weeks, allowing each female rat to produce around five litters a year\\". History Animal testing has been going on for centuries. In fact, animal testing has had an extremely long history. The first known tests on animals were done as early as 300 BC. \\"Writings of ancient civilizations all document the use of animal testing. These civilizations, led by men like Aristotle and Erasistratus, used live animals to test various medical procedures\\". This testing was important because it led to new discoveries such as how blood circulated and the fact that living beings needed air to survive. The idea of taking an animal and comparing it to how human beings survived was a completely new idea. It would not have existed (at least not as quickly as it did) without our ancestors studying animals and how their bodies worked. \\"Proving the germ theory of disease was the crowning achievement of the French scientist Louis Pasteur. He was not the first to propose that diseases were caused by microscopic organisms, but the view was controversial in the 19th century and opposed the accepted theory of 'spontaneous generation'\\". The idea of germs and other microscopic organisms was a completely new idea and wouldn't have come to be without the use of animals. In 1665, scientists Robert Hooke and Antoni van Leeuwenhoek discovered and studied how germs worked. They published a book about their discovery, which was not accepted by very many people, including the science community, at first. After some time, scientists were able to give animals diseases from microbes and realized that microbes really did exist. From there they were able to use animals to understand how the disease worked, and the effects it could potentially have on the human body. All of this has led up to something a bit more recent, the use of animals to test beauty products. This has become a very controversial topic in recent years. There are many people who are extremely against the use of animals for this purpose, and for a good reason. \\"Typically, animal tests for cosmetics include skin and eye irritation tests where chemicals are rubbed onto the shaved skin or dripped into the eyes of rabbits; repeated oral force-feeding studies lasting weeks or months to look for signs of general illness or specific health hazards, such as cancer or birth defects; and even widely condemned \\"lethal dose\\" tests, in which animals are forced to swallow massive amounts of a test chemical to determine the dose that causes death\\". This kind of testing can be vital in finding important information about products but can be harmful to the animals it is tested on. In 1937, a mistake was made that ended up changing the pharmaceutical industry drastically. A company created a medicine (Elixir sulfanilamide) \\"to treat streptococcal infections\\", and without any scientific research the medicine was out on shelves. This medicine turned out to be extremely poisonous to people, leading to large poisoning outbreaks followed by over 100 deaths. This epidemic led to a law being passed in 1938, called the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, enforcing more rigorous guidelines on cosmetic products. After this law was passed companies looked to animals to test their products, in turn, creating the first encounters of cosmetic animal testing.  Non-profit organizations  This \\"Leaping Bunny\\" indicates that cosmetic products with this logo have not been tested on animals. *Cruelty Free International: Cruelty Free International and its partners manage the certification of all the companies across the world looking to be cruelty free. Companies producing beauty and household products which do not test their products on animals for any market can request membership of The Leaping Bunny Program, which allows that company to feature Cruelty Free International's Leaping Bunny logo on their products. This program sets global standard of operations and sales. Companies headquartered internationally can obtain certification from Cruelty Free International. Companies headquartered in the United States and Canada can obtain certification from The Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics (CCIC) In 2013, over 500 companies were certified. However, some company's certifications were revoked after it was discovered they continued to test on animals in Asia. *Humane Society International: This is a global animal protection organization that works to help all animals‚Äîincluding animals in laboratories. Procedures of animal testing There is a strategy used in animal testing laboratories titled the 'Three R's:' Reduction, refinement, and replacement' (Doke, \\"Alternatives to Animal Testing: A Review\\"). *Reduction: This approach is built upon the ethics to have a minimal number of animal subjects being tested on for current and later tests. *Refinement: This suggests that the planned distress and pain caused to an animal subject to be as little as possible. This approach focuses on making a home for the animals before entering testing grounds in order to elongate the life of laboratory animals. Discomfort to animals causes an imbalance in hormonal levels which create fluctuating results during testing. *Replacement: This provides the opportunity to study the response of cellular models, but in other words, replacement searches for alternatives that could be done rather than testing on animal subjects. Legal requirements and status Due to the strong public backlash against cosmetic testing on animals, most cosmetic manufacturers say their products are not tested on animals. However, they are still required by trading standards and consumer protection laws in most countries to show their products are not toxic and not dangerous to public health, and that the ingredients are not dangerous in large quantities, such as when in transport or in the manufacturing plant. In some countries, it is possible to meet these requirements without any further tests on animals. In other countries, it may require animal testing to meet legal requirements. The United States and Japan are frequently criticized for their insistence on stringent safety measures, which often requires animal testing. Some retailers distinguish themselves in the marketplace by their stance on animal testing. = Legal requirements in Japan = Although Japanese law doesn't require non-medicated cosmetics to be tested on animals, it doesn't prohibit it either, leaving the decision to individual companies. Animal testing is required mainly when the product contains newly-developed tar colors, ultraviolet ray protective ingredients or preservatives, and when the amount of any ingredient regulated in terms of how much can be added is increased. Japanese Brands such as Shiseido and Mandom have ended much, but not all, of their animal testing. However, most other leading cosmetics companies in Japan still test on animals. = Jurisdictions with bans =  Brazil, S√£o Paulo  S√£o Paulo in Brazil, banned cosmetic animal testing in 2014.  Colombia  In June 2020, the Senate of the Republic of Colombia approved a resolution banning the commercialization and testing of cosmetics on animals. In August 2020, presidential assent was granted to the resolution thus effectively banning the testing of cosmetics on animals in Colombia.  European Union  The European Union (EU) followed suit, after it agreed to phase in a near-total ban on the sale of animal-tested cosmetics throughout the EU from 2009, and to ban cosmetics-related animal testing. Animal testing is regulated in EC Regulation 1223/2009 on cosmetics. Imported cosmetics ingredients tested on animals were phased out for EU consumer markets in 2013 by the ban, but can still be sold to outside of the EU. Norway banned cosmetics animal testing the same time as the EU. In May 2018 the European Parliament voted for the EU and its Member States to work towards a UN convention against the use of animal testing for cosmetics.  European Free Trade Association  The rest of the EFTA, including Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, and Iceland also banned cosmetic testing.  Guatemala  In 2017, Guatemala banned cosmetic animal testing.  India  In early 2014, India announced a ban on testing cosmetics on animals in the country, thereby becoming the second country in Asia to do so. Later India banned import of cosmetics tested on animals in November 2014.  Israel  Israel banned \\"the import and marketing of cosmetics, toiletries or detergents that were tested on animals\\" in 2013.  New Zealand  In 2015, New Zealand also banned animal testing.  Turkey  Turkey \\"banned any animal testing for cosmetic products that have already been introduced to the market.\\"  UK  Animal testing on cosmetics or their ingredients was banned in the UK in 1998. = Jurisdictions where prohibitions are considered =  Association of Southeast Asian Nations  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is potentially \\"making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals.\\"  Australia  In Australia, the End Cruel Cosmetics Bill was introduced to Parliament in March 2014, which would ban local testing, which generally doesn't happen there, and importation of cosmetics tested on animals. In 2016 a bill was passed to ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals, which came into effect in July 2017.  Brazil  Brazil's legislation will vote on a nationwide animal testing for cosmetics ban by the end of March 2014.  Canada  The animal experimentation industry is largely unregulated and allowed to operate in near secrecy. No one knows exactly how many animals are used because many private-sector experimenters are unregulated and not required to disclose the numbers of animals used, species, or the types of tests they perform. The number of private facilities conducting animal experiments in Canada is unknown.  United States  In March 2014, the Humane Cosmetics Act was introduced to the U.S. congress which would ban cosmetic testing on animals and eventually would ban the sale of cosmetics tested on animals. The bill did not advance.  Mexico  On March 19, 2020, the Mexican Senate unanimously passed legislation banning testing cosmetics on animals. The proposed ban now awaits approval from the lower house of the Mexican Congress, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies.  South Korea  South Korea is also potentially \\"making strides toward ending cosmetics testing on animals.\\"  Taiwan  In 2015, Taiwan launched a bill proposing a ban on cosmetic testing on animals. It passed in 2016 and went into effect in 2019. Shortly before the ban went into effect on November 9, 2019, however, it was noted that most Taiwan cosmetic companies already did not experiment with animals. = Other statuses =  China  China passed a law on 30 June 2014 to eliminate the requirement for animal testing of cosmetics. Though domestically-produced ordinary cosmetic goods do not require testing, animal testing is still mandated by law for Chinese-made \\"cosmeceuticals\\" (cosmetic goods which make a functional claim) which are available for sale in China. Cosmetics intended solely for export are exempt from the animal testing requirement. As of March 2019, post-market testing (i.e. tests on cosmetics after they hit the market) for finished imported and domestically produced cosmetic products will no longer require animal testing. Chinese law was further amended in April 2020, fully dropping all remaining mandatory animal testing requirements for all cosmetics - both locally produced and imported, instead creating a regulatory 'preference' for non- animal based testing methods in the safety certification of cosmetic products.  Russia  In 2013, the Russian Ministry of Health stated \\"Toxicological testing is performed by means of testing for skin allergic reaction or test on mucous tissue/eye area (with use of lab animals) or by use of alternative general toxicology methods (IN VITRO). In this manner the technical regulations include measures which provide an alternative to animal testing\\".

In the general sense, it refers to the internal application of stress to certain mechanical systems. Fastener preload '''' The most common usage is to describe the load applied to a fastener as a result of its being installed, i.e., before any external loads are applied (e.g., tightening the nut on a bolt). Preload in such cases is important for several reasons. First, a tightened bolt experiences only a small fraction of any external load that will be applied later, so that a fully tightened bolt can (depending on the exact application) sustain a much greater load than a loosely tightened bolt. Second, a nut that is correctly tightened will resist becoming loose under the influence of vibration, temperature cycling, etc. Bearing preload Internal stress to a bearing through application of negative clearance is known as bearing preloading. Advantages of preloading include the following: maintain axial and radial position for accurate displacements of angular movements; increase bearing rigidity; prevent sliding or gyroscope-like movements, especially with high acceleration or rotation rates; maintain relative position of bearing elements. Preloading methods include position preload and constant pressure preload. Testing preload It is also used in testing a specimen, for a process where the crosshead moves to load the specimen to a specified value before a test starts. Data is not captured during the preload segment. When tensile specimens are initially placed into testing grips, they can be subjected to small compressive forces. These forces can cause specimens to bend imperceptibly, causing inaccurate and inconsistent results. Establishing a small preload as a part of the test method eliminates those compressive forces on specimens and improves the repeatability of results. Applications Preload becomes very important for large mechanical and high performance system such as large Telescopes., p. 207-8 In the general sense, it refers to the internal application of stress to certain mechanical systems. By tensioning, preloading increases the natural frequency of a structure, avoiding resonance due to external disturbances. It also prevents buckling if stresses change depending on position in certain systems. In the particular case for bearings and fasteners, preload reduces or cancels backlash or dead zones. In addition, preload aids to limit applied loads to a system.

The notable John Anderson chose to portray McNaught in this play before retiring from the stage. Background The play is based on her 1937 novel Death on the Nile which in itself started off as a play which Christie called Moon on the Nile. Once written, she decided it would do better as a book and she only resurrected the play version in 1942 when she was in the middle of writing the theatrical version of And Then There Were None and her actor friend Francis L. Sullivan was looking for a play in which Hercule Poirot might feature. Discussions took place until October as Christie was tired of the character of Poirot and wanted to exclude him from the drama altogether. She managed to persuade Sullivan of this plan when she promised to write into the play the part of a church canon for him to play.Morgan, Janet. Agatha Christie, A Biography. (pp. 239‚Äì240) Collins, 1984 Once backing had been found, rehearsals for the play began in January 1944 in Dundee in which Christie enthusiastically joined in, now that she was thoroughly enamoured of the theatre and its people. It premiered there on 17 January at the Dundee Repertory TheatreUniversity of Glasgow page on play and the title of the play had also been changed to Hidden Horizon. For reasons not specified in her biography, these rehearsals and the plans to stage the play appear to have suffered delays to find a London theatre to take the show, once it had been tried out in the provinces. Matters were not helped by the lukewarm critical reaction to Appointment with Death when that play opened in March 1945. A further issue was the objection of an official from the Ministry of Labour to the presence of a maid in the cast of characters. The play, with the name Murder on the Nile finally opened in the West End on 19 March 1946 at the Ambassadors Theatre, where six years later The Mousetrap would open. By this time, Sullivan was no longer in the cast.Morgan. (p. 245) The play features fewer characters who were derived from multiple of the book's characters; Marie Van Schuyler and Mrs. Allerton are merged into the character of Helen Ffoliot-ffoulkes while Cornelia Robson and Miss Bowers become Christina Grant. William Smith is a combination of Mr. Fanthorp and Mr. Ferguson and the three characters of Hercule Poirot, Colonel Race, Andrew Pennington become Canon Ambrose Pennefather. In addition, Simon Doyle's surname changes to Mostyn, Linnet Ridgeway is now Kay, and Jacqueline de Bellefort becomes Jacqueline de Severac. Characters taken out completely are Salome and Rosalie Otterbourne, Signor Richetti, Mrs. and Tim Allerton, Fleetwood, and Joanna Southwood. Lord Windelsham's character does not appear but he is mentioned by Helen as Lord Edgbaston. Scenes Act 1: On the palace steamer Lotus in late afternoon. Act 2 Scene 1: The same; three days later. Scene 2: The same; five minutes later. Act 3: The same; the following morning.

But Egypt offers the scene-painter a better chance (nicely taken by Danae Gaylen) and the off-stage tattoo of African percussion-music. The piece has the proper excitements of its hard-worked kind; a weakness lies in its blending of the usual mystery-mechanism with unusual human emotion. We have come to take our murders lightly in this kind of theatre; consequently a serious ending, with the guilty party nobly declining an obvious suicide at sacerdotal urgence, the better to find salvation via the scaffold, is too momentous a finale for so light a morsel of play-making. The previous and familiar appurtenance of clue and counter-clue one contentedly accepts: all this is apt enough ‚Äì but must there be heaven, too? We leave with a sense of conflict. Has not the Oo-dun-it or Egyptian Butcher-bird been devoured in the last minute, by an 'Allegory on the Banks of the Nile'?\\"The Observer 24 March 1946 (p. 2) The play was reviewed in the Daily Mirror of 21 March 1946 by Bernard Buckham who said, \\"An Agatha Christie play, but a poor one. Various acts of violence on a pleasure steamer and it becomes a question of 'who murdered the bride?' At this time of day such a set-ups needs to have character interest, ingenuity of plot, and excitement. This piece falls down on them all. Most of the acting fireworks fall to the lot if Vivienne Bennett, and she touches them off very cleverly.\\"Daily Mirror 21 March 1946 (p. 7) =Credits of London production= Director: Claude GurneyAgatha Christie ‚Äì Official Centenary Celebration (p. 79). 1990.

Smoak also ordered the school to notify, in writing, all high school and middle school students that they possess this right. In Brayshaw v. City of Tallahassee, Fla. Smoak struck down a Florida statute which made it a crime to \\"publish or disseminate the residence address or telephone number of any law enforcement officer while designating the officer as such...\\" Brayshaw had posted, online, the name of a Tallahassee police officer, along with her home address, cell phone number and age, and also criticized the officer, stating that she was verbally abusive, rude and unprofessional. Brayshaw challenged the constitutionality of the Florida statute, claiming a right to free speech under the First Amendment. On April 30, 2010, Judge Smoak struck down the 1972 Florida law, finding that the statute was \\"unconstitutional on its face\\". Reassignment of cases On May 29, 2015, all of Smoak's cases were reassigned to other judges by an administrative order issued by Chief Judge Margaret Catharine Rodgers.

Plot Years ago, opera singer Lorraine Sedgewick (Vicki Marentette) was killed in her dressing room at an opera house, supposedly by Lorenzo Orsini (Jonathan Barrett), one of the lead actors in a performance of Pagliacci. When Orsini was thought to have fled to Europe afterwards, the opera house closed down. Years later, high school student Kate (Sarah Lassez) is plagued with nightmares after discovering she is Lorraine's daughter. Kate's best friend Monica (Tatyana Ali) convinces Kate to help restore the opera house, and when they arrive they meet the rest of the group including nerdy Cheryl \\"Walnut\\" Webber (Melissa Galianos), flamboyant Marty (J. P. Grimard), rebel George (James Duvall), vindictive Ashley (Liz Crawford) and her jock boyfriend Taylor (Ryan Bittle). The group are lectured by their teacher Ms. Gibby (Margot Kidder), however a stage light falls and nearly hits her, drawing the attention of the owner of the opera house Mr. Caruthers (Christopher Plummer). The group deduces it was an accident, however Mr. Caruthers insists the opera house is haunted by Lorraine, upsetting Kate who is comforted by Ms. Gibby. Soon after, Ms. Gibby leaves, allowing the teenagers to lock up, who instead engage in pizza and beers, before investigating Lorraine's murder scene. They find a patch of fresh blood, that causes Kate to have a vivid vision of her mother's death. While everyone else leaves, Monica consoles Kate, before the pair discover Lorenzo is Kate's father. Ms. Gibby arrives the following morning, but is swiftly murdered with an axe by the killer, who is dressed like the clown that killed Lorraine. When the group arrive they begin cleaning, despite Ms. Gibby's absence. Ashley and Taylor sneak off to have sex, however Taylor ditches Ashley when they get into an argument, before the killer attacks Ashley and strangles her to death. Hearing the attack, Monica begins to investigate, only to find the clown who chases her until she reaches the rest of the group, where it is revealed that George dressed up as the clown to scare her. The group decide to try to locate the missing Ashley and Ms. Gibby, but while in the basement Monica is attacked by the clown who chases her and finally stabs her with a spear. Meanwhile, Kate attempts to phone the school but the phone is cut dead before she discovers they have become locked in the opera house. The group begin to panic and soon after find Ashley hung on the stage. Marty falls through a stage door, and Kate and George rush to save him, however he is electrocuted to death. Meanwhile, Taylor and Cheryl reach the roof to escape, but the clown grabs Taylor and throws him off the roof, killing him while Cheryl flees, however she is soon decapitated. Kate and George decide Lorenzo is not the killer, before they are split up. Kate runs to the auditorium and is chased by the clown onto a catwalk where she runs into Mr. Caruthers. Mr. Caruthers sends the clown over the catwalk, killing him, but Mr. Caruthers then turns on Kate and knocks her out. Kate awakes tied up in the auditorium with the victims bodies propped up on the seats. It is revealed Mr. Caruthers killed Lorraine because she denied him love, before another clown arrives and attacks him. In the panic, the clown is knocked out, but Kate breaks free and manages to kill Mr. Caruthers. The clown is revealed to be George, who was told by Kate's father, who had been living in the opera house, all about Mr. Caruthers before he had been killed on the catwalk. Kate and George then break free from the opera house. Cast Production The movie was filmed in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada at the Walker Theatre in downtown Winnipeg. In one scene near the end of the film taking place on the rooftop, the Richardson Building and 201 Portage at Portage and Main can be seen. Home media The film was released on VHS on August 31, 1999. The film was released as a double feature alongside Phantom Racer on October 5, 2010.

A fan is a powered machine used to create a flow of air. A fan consists of a rotating arrangement of vanes or blades, which act on the air. The rotating assembly of blades and hub is known as an impeller, rotor, or runner. Usually, it is contained within some form of housing, or case. This may direct the airflow, or increase safety by preventing objects from contacting the fan blades. Most fans are powered by electric motors, but other sources of power may be used, including hydraulic motors, handcranks, and internal combustion engines. Mechanically, a fan can be any revolving vane, or vanes used for producing currents of air. Fans produce air flows with high volume and low pressure (although higher than ambient pressure), as opposed to compressors which produce high pressures at a comparatively low volume. A fan blade will often rotate when exposed to an air-fluid stream, and devices that take advantage of this, such as anemometers and wind turbines, often have designs similar to that of a fan. Typical applications include climate control and personal thermal comfort (e.g., an electric table or floor fan), vehicle engine cooling systems (e.g., in front of a radiator), machinery cooling systems (e.g., inside computers and audio power amplifiers), ventilation, fume extraction, winnowing (e.g., separating chaff of cereal grains), removing dust (e.g. sucking as in a vacuum cleaner), drying (usually in combination with a heat source) and providing draft for a fire. While fans are often used to cool people, they do not cool air (electric fans may warm it slightly due to the warming of their motors), but work by evaporative cooling of sweat and increased heat convection into the surrounding air, due to the airflow from the fans. Thus, fans may become ineffective at cooling the body if the surrounding air is near body temperature and contains high humidity. A fan blade is generally made of wood, plastic, or metal. Fans have several applications in the industries. Some fans directly cool the machine and process, and may be indirectly used for cooling in the case of industrial heat exchangers. These are critical machines and responsible for operating the entire plant, which may shut down without the proper fan. In mine and tunnel, it also used as safety equipment.  History  Patent drawing for a Fan Moved by Mechanism, November 27, 1830 The punkah fan was used in India about 500 BCE. It was a handheld fan made from bamboo strips or other plant fiber, that could be rotated or fanned to move air. During British rule, the word came to be used by Anglo-Indians to mean a large swinging flat fan, fixed to the ceiling and pulled by a servant called the punkawallah. For purposes of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 CE) invented a manually operated rotary fan with seven wheels that measured 3 m (10 ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618‚Äì907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the rotary fan became even more common during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279).Needham (1986), Volume 4, Part 2, 99, 134, 151, 233.Day & McNeil (1996), 210. In the 17th century, the experiments of scientists including Otto von Guericke, Robert Hooke and Robert Boyle, established the basic principles of vacuum and airflow. The English architect Sir Christopher Wren applied an early ventilation system in the Houses of Parliament that used bellows to circulate air. Wren's design would be the catalyst for much later improvement and innovation. The first rotary fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by Georg Agricola (1494‚Äì1555).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 154. John Theophilus Desaguliers, a British engineer, demonstrated the successful use of a fan system to draw out stagnant air from coal mines in 1727 and soon afterward he installed a similar apparatus in Parliament. Good ventilation was particularly important in coal mines to reduce casualties from asphyxiation. The civil engineer John Smeaton, and later John Buddle installed reciprocating air pumps in the mines in the North of England. However, this arrangement was not as ideal as the machinery was liable to breaking down. = Steam = With the advent of practical steam power, fans could finally be used for ventilation. In 1837 William Fourness of England installed a steam-driven fan at Leeds.Collieries of Wales: Engineering and Architecture, By Stephen R. Hughes, Page 97 In 1849 a 6m radius steam- driven fan, designed by William Brunton, was made operational in the Gelly Gaer Colliery of South Wales. The model was exhibited at the Great Exhibition of 1851. Also in 1851 David Boswell Reid, a Scottish doctor, installed four steam-powered fans in the ceiling of St George's Hospital in Liverpool, so that the pressure produced by the fans would force the incoming air upward and through vents in the ceiling.HISTORIC BUILDING ENGINEERING SYSTEMS & EQUIPMENT HEATING & VENTILATION, By Brian Roberts, CIBSE Heritage Group Improvements in the technology were made by James Nasmyth, Frenchman Theophile Guibal and J. R. Waddle. = Electrical = Two c. 1980 box fans Between 1882 and 1886 Schuyler Wheeler invented a fan powered by electricity. It was commercially marketed by the American firm Crocker & Curtis electric motor company. In 1882, Philip Diehl developed the world's first electric ceiling fan. During this intense period of innovation, fans powered by alcohol, oil, or kerosene were common around the turn of the 20th century. In 1909, KDK of Japan pioneered the invention of mass-produced electric fans for home use. In the 1920s, industrial advances allowed steel fans to be mass-produced in different shapes, bringing fan prices down and allowing more homeowners to afford them. In the 1930s, the first art deco fan (the \\"Silver Swan\\") was designed by Emerson. By the 1940s, Crompton Greaves of India became the world's largest manufacturer of electric ceiling fans mainly for sale in India, Asia, and the Middle East. By the 1950s, table and stand fans were manufactured in bright colors and eye-catching. Window and central air conditioning in the 1960s caused many companies to discontinue production of fans.Fancollectors.org ‚Äì A Brief History of Fans Information Provided by Steve Cunningham ‚Äì retrieved July 5, 2010. But in the mid-1970s, with an increasing awareness of the cost of electricity and the amount of energy used to heat and cool homes, turn-of- the-century styled ceiling fans became immensely popular again as both decorative and energy-efficient units. In 1998 William Fairbank and Walter K. Boyd invented the high-volume low-speed (HVLS) ceiling fan, designed to reduce energy consumption by using long fan blades rotating at low speed to move a relatively large volume of air.Industrial Fan Designer Finds Niche in Energy Efficiency ‚Äì Automation and Control, By David Greenfield, December 20, 2010, Blog on Design News, Information provided by Dianna Huff ‚Äì retrieved May 18, 2011.  Types  Ceiling fan with a lamp Mechanical revolving blade fans are made in a wide range of designs. They are used on the floor, table, desk, or hung from the ceiling (ceiling fan). They can also be built into a window, wall, roof, chimney, etc. Most electronic systems such as computers include fans to cool the circuits inside, and in appliances such as hair dryers and portable space heaters and mounted/installed wall heaters. They are also used for moving air in air-conditioning systems, and in automotive engines, where they are driven by belts or by a direct motor. Fans used for comfort create a wind chill by increasing the heat transfer coefficient but do not lower temperatures directly. Fans used to cool electrical equipment or in engines or other machines do cool the equipment directly by forcing hot air into the cooler environment outside of the machine. There are three main types of fans used for moving air, axial, centrifugal (also called radial) and cross flow (also called tangential). The American Society of Mechanical Engineers Performance Testing Code 11 (PTC)ASME PTC 11 ‚Äì Fans. provides standard procedures for conducting and reporting tests on fans, including those of the centrifugal, axial, and mixed flows. = Axial-flow = An axial box fan for cooling electrical equipment Axial-flow fans have blades that force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. This type of fan is used in a wide variety of applications, ranging from small cooling fans for electronics to the giant fans used in wind tunnels. Axial flow fans are applied in air conditioning and industrial process applications. Standard axial flow fans have diameters of 300‚Äì400 mm or 1,800‚Äì2,000 mm and work under pressures up to 800 Pa. Special types of fans are used as low-pressure compressor stages in aircraft engines. Examples of axial fans are: * Table fan: Basic elements of a typical table fan include the fan blade, base, armature, and lead wires, motor, blade guard, motor housing, oscillator gearbox, and oscillator shaft. The oscillator is a mechanism that motions the fan from side to side. The armature axle shaft comes out on both ends of the motor, one end of the shaft is attached to the blade and the other is attached to the oscillator gearbox. The motor case joins to the gearbox to contain the rotor and stator. The oscillator shaft combines the weighted base and the gearbox. A motor housing covers the oscillator mechanism. The blade guard joins to the motor case for safety. * Domestic Extractor Fan: Wall or ceiling mounted, the domestic extractor fan is employed to remove moisture and stale air from domestic dwellings. Bathroom extractor fans typically utilize a four- inch (100 mm) impeller, whilst kitchen extractor fans typically use a six-inch (150 mm) impeller as the room itself is often bigger. Axial fans with five- inch (125 mm) impellers are also used in larger bathrooms though are much less common. Domestic axial extractor fans are not suitable for duct runs over 3 m or 4 m, depending on the number of bends in the run, as the increased air pressure in longer pipework inhibits the performance of the fan. * Electro- mechanical fans: Among collectors, are rated according to their condition, size, age, and several blades. Four-blade designs are the most common. Five- blade or six-blade designs are rare. The materials from which the components are made, such as brass, are important factors in fan desirability. * Ceiling fan: A fan suspended from the ceiling of a room is a ceiling fan. Most ceiling fans rotate at relatively low speeds and do not have blade guards. Ceiling fans can be found in both residential and industrial/commercial settings. * In automobiles, a mechanical fan provides engine cooling and prevents the engine from overheating by blowing or drawing air through a coolant-filled radiator. The fan may be driven with a belt and pulley off the engine's crankshaft or an electric motor switched on or off by a thermostatic switch. * Computer fan for cooling electrical components and in laptop coolers * Fans inside audio power amplifiers help to draw heat away from the electrical components. * variable- pitch fan: A variable-pitch fan is used where precise control of static pressure within supply ducts is required. The blades are arranged to rotate upon a control-pitch hub. The fan wheel will spin at a constant speed. The blades follow the control pitch hub. As the hub moves toward the rotor, the blades increase their angle of attack and an increase in flow results.

File:Joy Axial Variable Pitch Fan.JPG80 hp variable-pitch supply fan = Centrifugal = Often called a \\"squirrel cage\\" (because of its general similarity in appearance to exercise wheels for pet rodents) or \\"scroll fan\\", the centrifugal fan has a moving component (called an impeller) that consists of a central shaft about which a set of blades that form a spiral, or ribs, are positioned. Centrifugal fans blow air at right angles to the intake of the fan and spin the air outwards to the outlet (by deflection and centrifugal force). The impeller rotates, causing air to enter the fan near the shaft and move perpendicularly from the shaft to the opening in the scroll-shaped fan casing. A centrifugal fan produces more pressure for a given air volume, and is used where this is desirable such as in leaf blowers, blowdryers, air mattress inflators, inflatable structures, climate control in air handling units and various industrial purposes. They are typically noisier than comparable axial fans (although some types of centrifugal fans are quieter such as in air handling units). Centrifugal fan.pngA diagram of a centrifugal fan, with a top view to show airflow CentrifugalFan.pngTypical centrifugal fan = Cross-flow fan = Cross-section of a cross-flow fan, from the 1893 patent. The rotation is clockwise. The stream guide F is usually not present in modern implementations. Cross-flow fan The cross-flow or tangential fan, sometimes known as a tubular fan, was patented in 1893 by Paul Mortier,Paul Mortier. Fan or Blowing apparatus. US Pat. No. 507,445 and is used extensively in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), especially in ductless split air conditioners. The fan is usually long concerning the diameter, so the flow remains approximately two-dimensional away from the ends. The cross-flow fan uses an impeller with forward-curved blades, placed in a housing consisting of a rear wall and a vortex wall. Unlike radial machines, the main flow moves transversely across the impeller, passing the blading twice. The flow within a cross-flow fan may be broken up into three distinct regions: a vortex region near the fan discharge, called an eccentric vortex, the through-flow region, and a paddling region directly opposite. Both the vortex and paddling regions are dissipative, and as a result, only a portion of the impeller imparts usable work on the flow. The cross-flow fan, or transverse fan, is thus a two-stage partial admission machine. The popularity of the crossflow fan in HVAC comes from its compactness, shape, quiet operation, and ability to provide a high pressure coefficient. Effectively a rectangular fan in terms of inlet and outlet geometry, the diameter readily scales to fit the available space, and the length is adjustable to meet flow rate requirements for the particular application. Common household tower fans are also cross-flow fans. Much of the early work focused on developing the cross-flow fan for both high- and low- flow-rate conditions and resulted in numerous patents. Key contributions were made by Coester, Ilberg and Sadeh, Porter and Markland, and Eck. One interesting phenomenon particular to the cross-flow fan is that, as the blades rotate, the local air incidence angle changes. The result is that in certain positions the blades act as compressors (pressure increase), while at other azimuthal locations the blades act as turbines (pressure decrease). Since the flow both enters and exits the impeller radially, the crossflow fan is well suited for aircraft applications. Due to the two-dimensional nature of the flow, the fan readily integrates into a wing for use in both thrust production and boundary-layer control. A configuration that utilizes a crossflow fan is located at the wing leading edge is the fanwing. This design creates lift by deflecting the wake downward due to the rotational direction of the fan, causing large Magnus force, similar to a spinning leading-edge cylinder. Another configuration utilizing a crossflow fan for thrust and flow control is the propulsive wing. In this design, the crossflow fan is placed near the trailing edge of a thick wing and draws the air of the wing's suction (top) surface. By doing this, the propulsive wing is nearly stall-free, even at extremely high angles of attack, producing very high lift. The external links section provides links to these concepts. A cross-flow fan is a centrifugal fan in which the air flows straight through the fan instead of at a right angle. The rotor of a cross-flow fan is covered to create a pressure differential. Cross-flow fans are made to have a double circular arc rear wall with a thick vortex wall that decreases in radial gap. The gap decreases in the direction of the fans impeller rotation. The rear wall has a log-spiral profile while the vortex stabilizer is a horizontal thin wall with rounded edge. The resultant pressure difference allows air to flow straight through the fan, even though the fan blades counter the flow of air on one side of the rotation. Cross-flow fans give airflow along the entire width of the fan; however, they are noisier than ordinary centrifugal fans, presumably because the fan blades fight the flow of air on one side of the rotation, unlike typical centrifugal fans. Cross-flow fans are often used in ductless air conditioners, air doors, in some types of laptop coolers, in automobile ventilation systems, and for cooling in medium-sized equipment such as photocopiers.  Uncommon types  Punkah wooden panel fan in Melrose antebellum house, (Natchez, Mississippi) = Bellows = Diagram of a single- acting hand bellows Bellows are also used to move air, although not generally considered fans. A hand-operated bellows is essentially a bag with a nozzle and handles, which can be filled with air by one movement, and the air expelled by another. Typically it would comprise two rigid flat surfaces hinged at one end, where a nozzle is fitted, and with handles at the other. The sides of the surfaces are joined by a flexible and air-proof material such as leather; the surfaces and joining material comprise a bag sealed everywhere but at the nozzle. (The joining material typically has a characteristic pleated construction that is so common that similar expanding fabric arrangements not used for moving air, such as on a folding camera, are called bellows.) Separating the handles expands the bag, which fills with air; squeezing them together expels the air. A simple valve (e.g., a flap) may be fitted so that air enters without having to come from the nozzle, which may be close to a fire. Bellows produce a directed pressurized stream of air; the airflow volume is typically low with moderate pressure. They are an older technology, used mainly to produce a strong and directed airflow, unlike non- electric bladed mechanical fans, before the introduction of electricity. * A single-acting bellows will only produce airflow during the exhaust stroke. * A double-acting bellows is a pair of bellows capable of blowing out air from one while inhaling air into the other, but airflow still temporarily ceases when the stroke direction is reversed. * Combining multiple bellows at third-cycle or quarter-cycle arrangements on a crank arm allows for nearly continuous airflow from several bellows at once; each is in a different phase of inhaling and exhausting during the cycle. = CoandƒÉ effect = An open-face supermarket freezer with an air curtain. Cooling air circulates across the food through the dark slot seen at the rear of the freezer, and through another grille not visible along the front. The Dyson Air Multiplier fans, and the Imperial C2000 series range hood fans, have no exposed fan blades or other visibly moving parts except their oscillating and tilting head. The airflow is generated using the CoandƒÉ effect; a small quantity of air from a high- pressure-bladed impeller fan, contained in the base rather than exposed, drives a large airmass via a low-pressure area created by the airfoil.Dyson Air Multiplier Review: Making a $300 Fan Takes CojonesVideo Review: The Dyson Air Multiplier, Posted October 12, 2009, by John Biggs, TechCrunch The US Patent & Trademark Office initially ruled that Dyson's patent was not an improvement on the Toshiba patent on a nearly identical bladeless desktop fan granted in 1981. Air curtains and air doors also utilize this effect to help retain warm or cool air within an otherwise exposed area that lacks a cover or door. Air curtains are commonly used on open-face dairy, freezer, and vegetable displays to help retain chilled air within the cabinet using a laminar airflow circulated across the display opening. The airflow is typically generated by a mechanical fan of any type described in this article hidden in the base of the display cabinet. = Convective = Differences in air temperature will affect the density of air and can be used to induce air circulation through the mere act of heating or cooling an air mass. This effect is so subtle and works at such low air pressures that it does not appear to fit the definition of fan technology. However, before the development of electricity, convective airflow was the primary method of inducing airflow in living spaces. Old fashioned oil and coal furnaces were not electric and operated simply on the principle of convection to move the warm air. Very large volume air ducts were sloped upwards away from the top of the furnace towards floor and wall registers above the furnace. Cool air was returned through similar large ducts leading to the bottom of the furnace. Older houses from before electrification often had open duct grilles leading from the ceiling of a lower level to the floor of an upper level, to allow convective airflow to slowly raise the building from one floor to the next. Outhouses commonly rely on a simple enclosed air channel in a corner of the structure to exhaust offensive odors. Exposed to sunlight, the channel is warmed and slow convective air current is vented out the top of the building, while fresh air enters the pit through the seat hole. = Electrostatic = An electrostatic fluid accelerator propels airflow by inducing motion in airborne charged particles. A high voltage electric field (commonly 25,000 to 50,000 volts) formed between exposed charged anode and cathode surfaces is capable of inducing airflow through a principle referred to as ionic wind. The airflow pressure is typically very low but the air volume can be large. However, a sufficiently high voltage potential can also cause the formation of ozone and nitrogen oxides, which are reactive and irritating to mucous membranes.  Noise  Fans generate noise from the rapid flow of air around blades and obstacles causing vortexes, and from the motor. Fan noise is roughly proportional to the fifth power of fan speed; halving speed reduces noise by about 15 dB.UK Health and Safetey Executive: Top 10 noise control techniques The perceived loudness of fan noise also depends on the frequency distribution of the noise. This in turn depends on the shape and distribution of moving parts, especially of the blades, and of stationary parts, struts in particular. Like with tire treads, and similar to the principle of acoustic diffusors, an irregular shape and distribution can flatten the noise spectrum, making the noise sound less disturbing. Tae Kim. \\"Reduction of Tonal Propeller Noise by Means of Uneven Blade Spacing\\". p. 4 M. Boltezar; M. Mesaric; A. Kuhelj. \\"The influence of uneven blade spacing on the SPL and noise spectra radiated from radial fans\\". The inlet shape of the fan can also influence on the noise levels generated by the fan.https://www.nidec.com/en/technology/casestudy/pc/  Fan motor drive methods  Building heating and cooling systems commonly use a squirrel cage fan driven by a belt from a separate electric motor. Standalone fans are usually powered by an electric motors, often attached directly to the motor's output, with no gears or belts. The motor is either hidden in the fan's center hub or extends behind it. For big industrial fans, three-phase asynchronous motors are commonly used, placed near the fan, and driving it through a belt and pulleys. Smaller fans are often powered by shaded pole AC motors, or brushed or brushless DC motors. AC-powered fans usually use mains voltage, while DC-powered fans use low voltage, typically 24V, 12V, or 5 V. In machines with a rotating part, the fan is often connected to it rather than being powered separately. This is commonly seen in motor vehicles with internal combustion engines, large cooling systems, locomotives, and winnowing machines, where the fan is connected to the drive shaft or through a belt and pulleys. Another common configuration is a dual-shaft motor, where one end of the shaft drives a mechanism, while the other has a fan mounted on it to cool the motor itself. Window air conditioners commonly use a dual-shaft fan to operate separate blowers for the interior and exterior parts of the device. Where electrical power or rotating parts are not readily available, fans may be driven by other methods. High-pressure gases such as steam can be used to drive a small turbine, and high-pressure liquids can be used to drive a pelton wheel, either which can provide the rotational drive for a fan. Large, slow- moving energy sources such as a flowing river can also power a fan using a water wheel and a series of step-down gears or pulleys to increase the rotational speed to that which is required for efficient fan operation. 1989 Toyota 1HD-T Type engine front.jpgInternal combustion engines sometimes drive an engine cooling fan directly or may use a separate electric motor. Silniki by Zureks.jpgLarge electric motors may have a cooling fan either on the back or inside the case. (Shown with the black rear cover removed.) Air conditioning unit-en.svgDual shaft fan motor in a window air conditioner  Solar powered fan  Electric fans used for ventilation may be powered by solar panels instead of mains current. This is an attractive option because once the capital costs of the solar panel have been covered, the resulting electricity is free. Also, electricity is always available when the sun is shining and the fan needs to run. A typical example uses a detached 10-watt, solar panel and is supplied with appropriate brackets, cables, and connectors. It can be used to ventilate up to of area and can move air at up to .

Unilateral policy is a form of resale price maintenance that enables a manufacturer to influence the price at which its distributors and dealers resell its products without a formal contract regarding the resale price. The policy was first identified in United States v. Colgate & Co., . Development Beginning with the Sherman Act in 1890 which banned, \\"every contract, combination ‚Ä¶, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade\\" price fixing by the manufacturer was held to be illegal. In Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park and Sons, , the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's holding that a massive minimum resale price maintenance scheme was unreasonable and thus offended Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The decision rested on the assertion that minimum resale price maintenance is indistinguishable in economic effect from naked horizontal price fixing by a cartel. Subsequent decisions characterized Dr Miles as holding that minimum resale price maintenance is unlawful per se - that is, without regard to its impact on the marketplace or consumers. While vertical price agreements remained taboo, in 1919 the Supreme Court in United States v. Colgate & Co., recognized the manufacturer's right to deal with whomever it wanted, and as importantly, its right to refuse to deal. This distinction allowed manufacturers to announce terms under which they would deal with their resellers and then refuse to deal with those who failed to comply. Colgate's progeny in 1984 further built upon this right in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., stating that, \\"under Colgate, the manufacturer can announce its re-sale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply, and a distributor is free to acquiesce to the manufacturer's demand in order to avoid termination\\". \\"Colgate policies\\" are independently adopted and announced by the manufacturer. The manufacturer, without any agreement with the reseller, announces a minimum resale price and refuses to make further sales to any reseller that fails to sell at or above the announced price. There is no contract and the parties do not agree on the price. Aside from suggesting retail prices or having the reseller act as an agent of the manufacturer and sell the goods on consignment, until the 2007 Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS, Inc. decision a Unilateral Policy was the only way that a manufacturer could directly influence a reseller's retail price without subjecting itself to per se liability for price fixing.

In the past, it was treated in a wider sense, including plants from Wales now split off as Cotoneaster cambricus and plants from Scandinavia now treated as Cotoneaster scandinavicus, but differs from these in genetic profile and detail of foliage and fruit. It is a deciduous shrub growing to tall. The leaves are oval to oval-acute, long, green and thinly pubescent above at first, later glabrous, and densely pubescent below and on the leaf margin, with pale grey hairs. The flowers are produced in corymbs of one to four (occasionally up to seven) together in mid spring, each flower diameter, with five white to pale pink petals. The fruit is a dark red pome diameter, containing two or three seeds. It occurs on limestone soils, at altitudes of up to altitude. Nomenclature The genus name Cotoneaster comes from Latin cotone, quince, and the suffix -aster, meaning resembling. Cotone is a masculine noun, though in some older works it was wrongly treated as feminine, resulting in different name endings for many of the species, such as Cotoneaster integerrima instead of Cotoneaster integerrimus.

According to Gregory of Tours, Aphrodisius was an Egyptian who was martyred in Languedoc along with his followers Caralippus (Caralampus), Agapius, and Eusebius.In French, their names are Caralippe, Agape et Eus√®be. Legend A Christian tradition states that he was a prefect or high priest of Heliopolis who sheltered the Holy Family at Hermopolis when they fled into Egypt. Aphrodisius learned of the miracles of Jesus from Alexandrian Jews returning from a pilgrimage in Jerusalem. According to Christian legend, Aphrodisius went to Palestine to meet Jesus and became one of his disciples. After the Resurrection, Aphrodisius received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. He accompanied Sergius Paulus to Provence. They evangelized Narbonensis: Sergius settled in Narbonne. The legend continues that Aphrodisius arrived at B√©ziers mounted on a camel and became a hermit in a cave near the city. He lived in it a long time before becoming a bishop. Local traditions assign Aphrodisius as the first Bishop of B√©ziers and state that he was decapitated by a group of pagans, along with his companions, on the street now known as Place Saint-Cyr, the site of a Roman circus used for gladiators' fights. Aphrodisius was executed by beheading. The head was kicked into a well, but the water gushed out and the decapitated Aphrodisius picked up his own head, and carried it through the city. Townspeople spilled snails on the road and Aphrodisius stepped on them without breaking one. Several stonemasons began to mock him, calling him a madman. They were miraculously punished by being turned into stones (visitors still point out their seven stone heads on the Rue des T√™tes, \\"the street of the heads\\"). Aphrodisius left his head at the cave that he had previously occupied. This was a spot on which later stood a chapel dedicated to Saint Peter, later a basilica named after Aphrodisius (Saint-Aphrodise). This martyrdom is supposed to have occurred on April 28, 65 AD, during the reign of Nero. According to the story, after the death of his master, the camel was taken care of by a compassionate family of potters. When Aphrodisius was recognized as a saint, the city's leaders considered as an honor to take charge of all the expenses associated with the animal‚Äôs maintenance. They offered it a house at the beginning of a street and this road, after the camel‚Äôs death, took the name of \\"rue du Chameau\\" (\\"Camel Street\\"), afterwards rue Malbec.Lou Camel This is considered the origin of the local \\"f√™tes de Caritach\\" (feasts of charity). Historicity According to the Br√©viaire de B√©ziers, during the 14th and 15th centuries, he was presented as bishop and confessor who died of natural causes. It is only during the 16th century that new legends of his beheading were created. At the same time, the legend of the camel was also devised. Aphrodisius was probably a figure of the 3rd century. There are several saints with the name of Aphrodisius. The old martyrologies bear five saints with this name: the bishop of B√©ziers; a martyr of Tarsus in Cilicia celebrated on June 21; another martyr killed in Cilicia with 170 companions on April 28 c. 86 AD; another killed at Scythopolis, honored on May 4; and a martyr of Alexandria killed with several companions, honored on May 13. There is also a bishop of Hellespont with this name who at the beginning of the 4th century defended the Resurrection against a sect led by a man named Hierax. The first literary account of the life of Saint Aphrodisius of B√©ziers is probably that of Ado, the Carolingian author, who introduces the mission of Aphrodisius into the acts of Saint Paul de Narbonne. Gregory of Tours, in his History of Franks, mentions Aphrodisius. The first mention of the sanctuary dedicated to Aphrodisius is made by Usuard, who undertook a voyage in 858 to bring back from Spain relics for his abbey. In his relation of the voyage, he says to us that after \\"having left Cordoba, he returned by Girona, Narbonne and B√©ziers, a city famed for its relics of blessed Aphrodisius\\". Veneration There was a custom of leading a camel in the procession at B√©ziers on the feast of the saint. The \\"camel\\" was actually a mechanical camel of wood with a moving head and jaws, covered with a painted fabric on which the armorial bearings of the city and two inscriptions were inscribed: the Latin ex antiquitate renascor (\\"I'm reborn from Antiquity\\") and the local Occitan sen fosso (\\"we are numerous\\"). This machine, which did not really resemble a camel, concealed in its sides a few operators who made its head and jaws and teeth move. This camel was utilized during all local, religious, and political festivals. This mechanical camel was led during the processions by a costumed figure named Papari,Possibly a variation of Papalin/Papalino, a soldier of the Pope. See http://www.sunnyfrance.net/histoiredebeziers/camel.htm who was escorted by other men disguised as wild men of the woods, whose heads were decorated with leaves. They danced to the sound of a bagpipe. Around the camel, herdsmen fought a mock battle. The camel was burned during the Wars of Religion and again during the French Revolution. The custom was revived in 1803 only to be discontinued during the Revolution of 1830, when it was considered a symbol of feudalism and religious fanaticism. Today, it continues to run through the city's streets during local holidays. The current head dates from the eighteenth century. In the 1970s, it was proposed that the camel be remade to give it a real camel's appearance. However, the townspeople protested and the camel retained its traditional appearance. The roots of this particular tradition are possibly to be found in the pre-Christian festivities dedicated to Bacchus, imported by the Phocaeans to southern France; Bacchus was sometimes depicted riding a camel.

Coast Guard history On permanent transfer the ship was renamed and reclassified Kukui (WAK-186) as the needed large cargo vessel to supply the equipment and personnel for the construction and logistical support of the Pacific Loran-A and Loran-C systems. Her name was changed to Kukui, a name taken from a buoy tender that had just been decommissioned, and was given the designation WAK-186. She was converted to Coast Guard specifications at the Coast Guard Yard in Curtis Bay, Maryland. During her Coast Guard career she was based out of Honolulu, Hawaii. Construction, major maintenance and supply of the systems was done by sailors of Kukui. Their dual role as seamen and construction workers was one of the most unique assignments in the armed forces. She carried on her decks two LCMs to ferry men and equipment to shore and also had three bulldozers, several trucks and a few jeeps stashed in her holds. Seven months a year she was underway providing necessary logistic support to members of the Coast Guard LORAN chain throughout the western Pacific. During this time she delivered \\"everything from toothpicks to antenna poles; from a can of pepper to a Quonset hut.\\" She also carried the complex electronic equipment necessary to set up the LORAN system. As a Coast Guard public affairs release noted: \\"The men and officers of the black-hulled cutter were a versatile group. They not only sailed the ship but they operated bulldozers, landing craft, trucks and jeeps.\\" A typical voyage would cover over and Kukui would deliver of cargo to the many Coast Guard operated LORAN stations throughout the western Pacific. In all she would make over 20 stops at various stations and ports, including Yokosuka, Japan and Manila Harbor in the Republic of the Philippines. On 15 June 1953 she rendered medical assistance to a civilian workman injured at Batan LORAN station. In 1957 the crew of the Kukui observed a lack of books in the Philippine school districts they visited. The following year they got up a collection of 400 books to give to needy schoolchildren. Through hard work and perseverance they increased the total to 45,000 books within the next three years. She also delivered relief supplies to the island of Batan after it was hit by Typhoon Elaine. On 1 December 1969, French Frigate Shoals LORAN Station was hit by a tidal wave, forcing the crew to evacuate and destroying much of the station. Kukui was sent to the island the following month and was responsible for her reconstruction and rehabilitation. On 24 June 1970 she collided with the M/V Myoriki Maru No. 25 six miles from Yokosuka, Japan, with both vessels receiving minor damage. In January 1972, the Kukui received word that as part of a move to reduce Coast Guard spending, she would be decommissioned. She later received word that upon her decommissioning in Honolulu on 1 March 1972, she would be turned over to the Navy who in turn would give her to the Philippine Navy.

MVP National is presented in partnership by the Center for the Study of Sport in Society (CSSS). * The Teamwork Leadership Institute (TLI) helps college senior administrators and athletic department staffs, through the provision of diversity training services, apply the principles of teamwork to all areas of athletic departments. * The Alcohol Response-Ability: Foundations for Student- Athletes program is a 90-minute, internet-based alcohol education and life skills program designed specifically for student-athletes and those who work with them in the college and university setting. * National STUDENT-Athlete Day (NSAD), celebrated annually on April 6, honors student-athletes who have achieved excellence in academics and athletics, while making significant contributions to their communities. * Community Service and Outreach Program, arranges for professional and college student-athletes to assist in the coordination of after-school programs on topics related to decreasing violence, avoiding substance abuse, understanding diversity, balancing academics and athletics, goal-setting, sportsmanship, citizenship and conflict resolution. * Degree Completion Program allows former student-athletes to complete their education in exchange for community service. Student-athletes who entered the member institution on an athletic scholarship, in a revenue or non-revenue producing sport are eligible to be readmitted, if academically eligible. Tuition is provided by the institution in the same proportion as it was during the student‚Äôs last year of eligibility. Student-athletes are able to continue their education as long as they are making progress toward their degree. In exchange for their tuition, student-athletes participate in the school‚Äôs community service and outreach program,.

Education Ungaro was born in 1951 in Miami Beach, Florida. She graduated from the University of Miami with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973 and from the University of Florida College of Law with a Juris Doctor in 1975. Career Ungaro was in private practice in Miami from 1976 to 1987. Ungaro practiced at Frates Floyd Pearson Stewart Richman & Greer from 1976 to 1978, Blackwell Walker Gray Powers Flick & Hoelhl from 1978 to 1980, Finley Kumble Heine Underberg Manley & Casey from 1980 to 1985, and was a shareholder at Sparber Shap & Heilbronner, P.A. from 1985 to 1987. Ungaro was a judge of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit of Florida from 1987 to 1992. Federal judicial service President George H. W. Bush nominated Ungaro- Benages to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 26, 1991, to the new seat created by 104 Stat. 5089. Confirmed by the Senate on October 8, 1992, she received commission on October 9, 1992. Notable cases On April 26, 2012, Ungaro ruled that an order issued by Florida Governor Rick Scott to randomly drug test 80,000 Florida state workers was unconstitutional. Ungaro found that Scott had not demonstrated that there was a compelling reason for the tests and that, as a result, they were an unreasonable search in violation of the Constitution. On December 19, 2018, Ungaro ruled, in Gubarev v. Buzzfeed, that Buzzfeed had not committed defamation in printing, in full, the Steele dossier. The claim was brought by Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian internet entrepreneur, who claimed to have been defamed by the publishing of the dossier by the media company, Buzzfeed. In part, Ungaro ruled the law of defamation does not equally apply to media institutions and does not require institutions to spend considerable resources to go line by line and determine the veracity of every claim in news reports. Ruling \\"Such a line-by-line review would curtail the scope of the privilege and thus restrict the press‚Äôs ability to serve its basic function.\\" For Buzzfeed, the use of a hyperlink citing a CNN article which contained a two-page synopsis of the report was sufficient to allow Buzzfeed to publish the report. The lawyers for Gubarev vowed to appeal the decision to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and specifically intend to argue the hyperlink to the original CNN article was insufficient. Buzzfeed's counsel praised the ruling \\"We are extremely pleased that Judge Ungaro affirmed our client‚Äôs First Amendment rights in this matter. Fighting against restraints on reporting and maintaining public confidence in the constitutionally-mandated right to a free and unfettered press is vitally important, perhaps more so now than ever. The ruling is a strong affirmation of the First Amendment. It‚Äôs more important that the public know what is being discussed at the highest levels of government than anything else. If BuzzFeed had not published, citizens would not understand the current conflict between the president and the other branches of government, as well as the conflict between the president and the special counsel.\\" On May 9, 2018, Judge Ungaro was assigned an FDA Case (US Vs US Stem Cells). The FDA is attempting to stop stem cell clinics from operating and selling an adipose tissue derived product called Stromal Vascular Fraction. Customers would undergo a minor liposuction to harvest stem cells which would then be used to treat various health issues. US Stem Cells Inc. had a permanent injunction granted against them on June 3 of 2019 to stop performing Stromal Vascular Fraction procedures. With this motion, Judge Ungaro created an order to destroy thousand of banked stem cells within 31 days that were now considered a drug by the State of Florida.https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1388319/000118518518000705/usstemcell10k123117.htm Legal experts believe this ruling was illegal because the banked stem cells are considered the property of each individual according to the contract of the banking agreement. In the United States, that means each person who has had their stem cells banked, has a right to due process before the destruction of their biological property if the contracting agreement deems that the cellular product being stored belongs to the customers, and not the banking facility. Judge Ungaro, the FDA, and the State of Florida did not give notice or provide legal proceeding to the individual who banked their stem cells. Nor did these parties give notice that their biological property would be destroyed. Judge Ungaro released a stay order on July 19, 2019 to delay the destruction of the banked cells.https://rickjaffeesq.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/07/staydestructionorder.pdf References Sources * 1951 births American women judges Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida Living people People from Miami Beach, Florida United States district court judges appointed by George H.

Andersson left GM in 2009 and became an advisor to Oleg Deripaska (a Russian industrial tycoon) and a head of Board of Directors of GAZ Group - the oldest car plant in Russia and the largest manufacturer of light commercial vehicles, buses and off-road heavy trucks. = GAZ Group = Andersson became the president of GAZ Group on August 7, 2009 with objective to combine development of company's strategy with running current operations. Main goal was to return the company to profitability. During five years at GAZ, he managed to turn-around the business from losses of $1 Billion to consistent EBIT profits: 7,6% (2010), 8,8% (2011), 10,3% (2012). In the Russian currency net profit changed from 30,5 bln RUR loss in 2008 to 8,8 bln RUR net profit for 2012.

It is situated in the ≈†abac municipality, in the Maƒçva District. The village has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbering 1,308 people (2002 census). History Sevarice is a very old village and there is not any reliable evidence of when it was founded. However, traces of the Roman civilization have been discovered in many places in today's village Sevarice. It is well known that this village was mentioned in ‚ÄúMonastery Ravanica's praise of Duke Lazar‚Äù in 1381, but with another name. The names of residents were changed with starting and finishing their migration to and from the village. In written historic recourses which have been saved up to the present, this village has been mentioned for the first time in a census completed in 1548, but it was named Orasac. The village was located on the place of today's estate. In the next census from 1718, which was done by an Australian colonel Nipert, the village consisted of 19 households. In a census from 1788 as a part of Macva duchy, it was mentioned as Orasac, too. According to these reviews it can be understood how the village developed. On the first sight it seems that development of the village was slow. However, in the whole history not only of the village but of Serbia too, there were always different kinds of wars and migrations. It can't be reliably claimed when the village changed its name and the location. By all accounts the location must have been changed before the name. For instance, the village Orasac was situated on the main road from Mitrovica to Sabacand, at the same time on the waterway of the small river Bitva. That was very inconvenient for the people of the village, concerning the permanent changes of conquerors, especially the Turkish ones. That is why the citizens of the village and the latter settlers left the location and moved to the southeastern parts of the country, towards the area covered with the forests and bushes. In that way they were hidden from the main road and the possible danger. People cut the trees down and then built their houses there. That is the reason why the village got its name Sevarice (\\"bushes\\" in English). That was a long-term process and it is not known when it ended. Making squares and straight streets in Macva was started during the reign of Duke Milos ( the ruler ) and his brother Jevrem, who made strong pressure on the people of Macva, especially in the villages around the roads to build their houses in strict rows. Macva's villages look like villages in Srem ( Voivodina ) ‚Äì two streets make the main square in a shape like the cros. There were four squares that older residents still remember: Arlovica, Djunis, Skolski sor, Preki sor. Beside these squares as the main roads, there were smaller narrow streets. Sevarice got its Municipality in 1839, soon after setting the municipal law from 1839. Uzvece, a small village near Sevarice, also belonged to the Municipality of Sevarice. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Sevarice was headquarters of Macva1s area. The first chairman was captain Great from Drenovac. The church of the ‚ÄúHoly Mother of God ‚Äú (Velike Gospojine), built in 1936, still remains and people can visit it every day on masses etc. There has been a school in Sevarice since the first half of 19th century, actually since 1928. It was the first village school in Macva and was located on Djuricici's hill. The school also was attended by the pupils from the villages nearby: Drenovac, Pricinovic, Tabanovic and Uzvece. There were 17 teachers in Sevarice since its foundation until World War I started. The first teacher was Novak Popovic. After World War II, in 1952 ‚ÄúZadruzni Dom‚Äù was built which is a one-storey-high building in the centre of the village, according to typical projects in Serbia. There is a local government office, a big and a small auditorium, a few business premises and a couple of rooms on the first floor. The first Collective farm in Sevarice was founded in 1926. It was one of the first associations in Macva. During its foundation collective farm consisted of 12 members and the first president was Zivan Sainovic. It had a purchasing type. According to the census of 2002 the number of citizens changed in this way: 1948 ‚Äì 1648, 1953-1668, 1961-1640, 1971-1582, 1981-1452, 1991-1295. Today there are 1308 citizens living in Sevarice and about 370-380 households.

Notable direct causes of hyperuricosuria are dissolution of uric acid crystals in the kidneys or urinary bladder, and hyperuricemia. Notable indirect causes include uricosuric drugs, rapid breakdown of bodily tissues containing large quantities of DNA and RNA, and a diet high in purine. Medications that may contribute to the cure or amelioration of hyperuricosuria include allopurinol which acts by inhibiting xanthine oxidase and reducing uric acid production.Hyperuricosuria may be a medical sign of: *Gout (very common) *Kidney stones of uric acid (uric acid nephrolithiasis) *Acute uric acid nephropathy *Acute kidney failure *Tumor lysis syndrome *Fanconi syndrome *Dent's disease (very rare) Classification Acute hyperuricosuria is a common complication of tumor lysis syndrome.

Chronic hyperuricosuria is associated with gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis. However, both conditions can occur in the absence of hyperuricosuria. Treatment of gout with uricosuric drugs can lead to uric acid nephrolithiasis. Treatment If neither hyperuricemia nor gout is present, then the risk of uric acid nephrolithiasis can be reduced by the use of antiuricosuric drugs.

The film premiered August 19, 2007 on Lifetime Television. The film is distributed by Believe Pictures and stars Lisa Pepper, Elliott Gould, Tess Harper, Soren Fulton, Danielle Chuchran, Abigail Mason, Tanner Maguire, Bailee Madison, and Jennifer O'Dell. The film was directed by Michael Landon Jr.  Plot  Sarah Cain (Lisa Pepper), a thirty-something columnist at the fictional Portland Times in Portland, Oregon, has seen better days in her career. When her boss Bill (Elliott Gould) rejects her latest column, he reminds her that she once wrote great stuff about life, instead of the puff-pieces she's been writing, and if she doesn't produce good writing again, she's heading back to the news-writing department. Sarah's cellphone rings while she's out to dinner with her boyfriend Bryan (Tom Tate), who is planning to propose to her. On the phone is Sarah's 16-year-old niece Lyddie (Abigail Mason), whom she has never met. Lyddie tells Sarah that her mother, Sarah's older sister Ivy, has just died of heart failure. Sarah hurries to Lancaster County, Pennsylvania for the funeral. Many years prior, Ivy married a man who was a member of an Amish community; her choice to join that community made Sarah feel abandoned and caused ill feelings between the sisters. Prior to Ivy's passing, her husband was hit by a car and killed. The court insists that as Ivy's sole surviving relative, Sarah is the legal guardian of Ivy's five children, and if she doesn't take responsibility for them, they'll be put into the state's foster- care system. Members of the community protest: they want no outsiders to raise the children. Lyddie and Miriam (Tess Harper), an elder and friend of Ivy's, convince Sarah to stay overnight to figure out what to do. As the deadline for her column is that night, Sarah writes about her day's events while she's there and e-mails that to Bill as a last-resort column. While at the hearing the next day, Sarah receives a reply e-mail about her piece: The readers loved it and want more. Sarah realizes an opportunity in the making, and decides to take the children back to Portland. While Lyddie stays in Sarah's apartment and does the housework, the four younger children try to fit in at school but are labeled freaks for their Amish garb. Caleb (Soren Fulton) quickly becomes a star on the wrestling team; Anna Mae (Danielle Chuchran) gains attention from boys after borrowing Sarah's clothing; and young Josiah (Tanner Maguire) hates it there. Only 6-year-old Hannah (Bailee Madison) is accepted on her first day of kindergarten. Bill likes the attention that the stories about the Amish children have produced, but Sarah rejects further offers of having the column being solely about them, feeling bad about using the kids. Meanwhile, Madison (Jennifer O'Dell), Sarah's rival at the paper, discovers where the children attend school and sends a TV news team to one of Caleb's wrestling matches. The children discover what Sarah has been doing and feel betrayed, because they had believed she was truly concerned for them. Sarah admits to them that the situation has spun out of control, and the kids go off to bed upset. Bryan also expresses disappointment in her. Sarah realizes what she has done and takes the kids back to the Amish settlement in Pennsylvania to assign them to the elders. As she's leaving the community, the children rush to catch up to her. When Sarah stops, Lyddie hands her a letter Ivy had written which contains her last wishes. Only then is the truth revealed: Ivy wanted Sarah to have the kids as an apology for breaking her heart, saying that they'd be \\"blessings to [her] as they were to me\\". Sarah changes her mind and decides to stay at the community with her nieces and nephews. The ending shows Sarah writing a book titled My Redemption. Bryan visits while on a business trip and brings her a piece of her favorite cheesecake as a reconciliation gesture, and they hug.

The art deco tower, designed by architect John Torrey Windrim as an annex for Wanamaker's department store, was completed in 1932. Wanamaker's Men's Store opened in the first seven floors of the building, which is located a block from Wanamaker's main store, and was intended to rival European department stores with its size and selection. In 1952, the Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) bought the building and converted it into offices and banking space. Until 2014, the building's bell tower was decorated on all four sides with PNB's initials in stainless steel tall. Wells Fargo is the main tenant, occupying almost half the building. The former banking space at street level was converted to retail and restaurant space in 2000. Containing of space, One South Broad features a three-story gallery lobby that connects to the Widener Building, adjacent to the south. The 24th and 25th floors originally featured a luxurious penthouse designed for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife; it was converted to office use in 2000 by independent advertising agency Red Tettemer O'Connell + Partners. The tower houses the 17-ton Founder's Bell, one of the largest in the world, a tribute to John Wanamaker by his son Rodman; listed on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, the bell is rung hourly, except for Sundays. History Philadelphia National Bank placed its initials on the bell tower in the 1950s. In the late 1920s, numerous high-rises were being built in Center City Philadelphia. Among the businesses constructing their own skyscrapers was Wanamaker's department store. Under direction of Wanamaker President William L. Nevin, Wanamaker's decided to expand its Philadelphia store by constructing a new building that would contain a store catering to the \\"Philadelphia gentleman\\". Nevin directed Wanamaker's to buy property on South Broad Street across the street from Philadelphia City Hall. The land was the site of two late-19th-century 13-story high-rises. On the corner of Broad and Penn Square stood the Lincoln Building, originally called the Betz Building. South of that stood the Liberty Building on the corner of Broad and Chestnut Streets. Both buildings were demolished in 1926 to make way for the Lincoln-Liberty Building. The Lincoln-Liberty Building, completed in 1932, was intended to partly house a large men's department store and offices. The building's cornerstone was set on October 1, 1932 with a ceremony attended by William L. Nevin and Wanamaker executives from New York City, Paris and London. The Wanamaker Men's Store opened on October 12, 1932, with four Wanamaker buglers blowing a reveille and the ringing of the building's Founders Bell. Opening during the Great Depression, Nevin said the new building was a sign of the store's faith that the economy would improve. Intended to rival European department stores in size and selection, the men's store ordered US$2 million worth of merchandise and was the largest store of its kind in the world. As early as 1939 there were rumors the men's store would close, but Wanamaker's would not close the store unless a replacement tenant would agree to rent the space. When a new tenant was ready to take the store's place in the 1950s, the men's store was relocated to the Wanamaker Building down the street. In the early 1950s, the Philadelphia National Bank (PNB) needed to expand into a larger space than it currently occupied. On November 3, 1952, the bank bought the Lincoln-Liberty Building for US$8.75 million. PNB president Frederic A. Potts said, \\"The purchase of this building will enable the Philadelphia National Bank more adequately and efficiently to support the large-scale industrial and commercial expansion under way in this city.\\" The bank spent millions of dollars modernizing the building and converting the former department store floors to banking space. Among the changes was the addition of a sign with the bank's initials in 1955. The bank officially opened in what was now called the PNB Building on January 16, 1956. The opening included turning on a rooftop weather indicator and celebration of the 250th anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's birth. View from LOVE Park with City Hall in front of One South Broad. The building was owned by the PNB and later its parent company CoreStates until it was sold to the JPMorgan Strategic Property Fund in 1996 for almost US$28.5 million. In 1998 the building's second-largest tenant, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, left for One Logan Square. The resulting vacancy prompted the owners to renovate the building, renamed One South Broad, at a cost of US$10 million. Renovations included modernizing the elevators, security and safety systems and converting the lower floors to retail and restaurant space. The renovations took eighteen months and One South Broad was officially rededicated on May 3, 2000. In April 2003 JPMorgan sold One South Broad to real-estate investor David Werner for US$48 million. Ninety-percent occupied in 2003, One Broad Street's largest tenant was Wachovia. Wachovia had gained office space in the tower after merging with First Union Corporation, which had merged with CoreStates in 1998. In 2006 Wachovia re-negotiated its lease, which was set to expire in 2010. After looking at other potential space in Center City, Wachovia made a deal to stay in One South Broad and three nearby properties, the Witherspoon Building, Wells Fargo Building, and the neighboring Widener Building, until the 2020s. Architecture One South Broad is a 28-story art deco office tower on south Broad Street in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Designed by architect John Torrey Windrim, the skyscraper contains of space. One South Broad originally had an ornate lower facade with a lot of detail and fluting that was removed in the 1950s renovation. Philadelphia National Bank's renovations included the addition of granite black slabs on the street level facade. These were removed in the 2000 renovation and replaced with imported Italian granite to better match the skyscraper's original architecture. The 2000 renovation also created a new entrance on the building's Broad Street front, which leads to a three-story gallery lobby. The lobby was expanded by demolishing a wall and connecting it to the lobby of the neighboring Widener Building. Containing each, the 24th and 25th floors were used as a penthouse apartment for Rodman Wanamaker, consisting of five bedrooms, six baths, and outdoor terraces. The rooms featured hardwood floors, marble fireplaces, and detailed cast-plaster crown molding. Originally the penthouse apartment was to be for Rodman Wanamaker and his wife but Wanamaker died in 1928 before the building was completed. Rodman Wanamaker's wife lived there only briefly, as she did not like the ringing bell in the tower overhead. The penthouse floors were converted to office use in 2000 by creative agency Red Tettemer + Partners. The firm Agoos/Lovera Architects modernized the basic office space on the 24th floor while preserving the ornate molding and materials that decorate the rest of the former penthouse space. The Philadelphia National Bank's initials adorned the top of the building, surrounding the top of the structure's bell tower, until 2014. The letters, which were made of stainless steel, each weighed . Until the 1970s, PNB used the sign to forecast weather by lighting the letters in red to indicate a warming trend, or green to predict the opposite. Wachovia considered removing the PNB sign in 2003 to replace it with its own signage, but, in response, some Philadelphians expressed nostalgia for the name of the former Philadelphia institution and hoped the sign would stay. The Philadelphia Historical Commission stated that the sign was not an integral part of the building's design or as significant to the city as the nearby PSFS Building's sign. On August 17, 2014, three of the PNB letters were removed from the building by helicopter, and the remaining nine were removed the following November 16. =Founder's Bell = The Founder's Bell. Within the bell tower is the 15-ton (34,776 lbs) Founder's Bell. The bell was cast in 1925 under a commission by Rodman WanamakerSee also: to honor his father John Wanamaker, founder of the department store. Cast by Gillett & Johnston in Croydon, England, the bell is at the rim and high and is one of the largest bells in the world. The bell was brought in 1926 by the Cunard liner Ascania to New York City, from which it was conveyed to Philadelphia by rail. The bell was carried on a flatcar and had clearance of only in some of the tunnels the train passed through. Tuned to a low D bass clef, the bell's original home was the Wanamaker Building, a block from One South Broad. It hung above the street in a specially built tower on the building's roof. Hung on December 23, 1926, the bell was first rung on New Year's Eve of that year. The bell is rung every hour, except on Sundays. The bell was originally intended to swing in the tower on top of One South Broad, but the swinging of the bell shook the building. A hammer driven by a 230-volt electric motor was later installed and currently rings the bell. The ringing of the bell, which can be heard for , is often mistakenly assumed to come from City Hall's clock tower across the street. Philadelphia Orchestra conductor Leopold Stokowski wrote in 1962 that the bell had \\"one of the finest sounds I have heard anywhere in America, Europe or Russia\\". In June 2000 the Founder's Bell was added to the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places by the Philadelphia Historical Commission. Tenants The Wanamaker's Men's Store occupied the first seven floors of the skyscraper until 1952 when the Philadelphia National Bank moved into the building. Over the years PNB became CoreStates, First Union Corp, Wachovia and finally Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo, which bought Wachovia in 2008, is One Broad Street's main tenant, occupying about half the building. Other tenants include various law firms, advertising firm Nitrogen US, public relations firm Tonic Life Communications, consulting company Electronic Ink, and the advertising agency Red Tettemer O'Connell + Partners. Past tenants have included Sylvania Electric Products, law firm Drinker Biddle & Reath, and advertising and public relations firm Earle Palmer Brown. The street-level space was converted into a bank once PNB bought the building. The bank branch closed in the 1990s and was converted into two roughly areas intended for retail or restaurant use. A McCormick & Schmick's restaurant opened in the Broad-Street‚ÄìPenn-Square corner in 2001. In late 2002, the Broad and Chestnut Streets corner was occupied by a Borders bookstore, which moved into the two-story-plus-mezzanine space after vacating the 1727 Walnut Street location it had occupied since 1990. Borders closed its store in 2011. A three-story Walgreens presently occupies the site (2014) and areas of the exceptionally beautiful Wanamaker Men's Store plasterwork ceiling are visible at the upper stories.

He played for the Seattle Mariners, Atlanta Braves, New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers. Early life and career Born in Kaneohe, Hawaii, Diaz was the thirteenth native Hawaiian to have played in the major leagues. He was originally drafted out of Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria, California by the Seattle Mariners in the third round of the 1981 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign. Seattle then drafted him again in the first round of the June secondary phase of the draft, and were able to sign him. After two seasons in the Mariners' organization, Diaz was traded to the Atlanta Braves for Jeff Burroughs. Despite a career earned run average of 4.22 in the M's farm system, in , he managed to bring that down to a far more respectable 2.81 his first season with the Richmond Braves. He earned a call to the major leagues the following season, and made his major league debut on June 30, against the Houston Astros. With the Braves trailing 3-1, Diaz entered the game in relief of Phil Niekro in the ninth inning. Diaz gave up one earned run to increase the Astros' lead to 4-1. The Braves, who won the National League West that season, came back to score four runs in the bottom of the inning to give Diaz his first career win. Diaz went 3-2 with a 4.03 ERA for the Braves in 1982. One of those three wins came against the New York Mets, the team that subsequently acquired him, on September 10, for Tom Hausman. Diaz had a career year in , his only full season with the Mets. He pitched in a career high 54 games, and had a 3-1 record with two saves and a 2.05 ERA. Following the season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers with Bob Bailor for Sid Fernandez and Ross Jones. As Fernandez was from Honolulu, this trade was unique in that it involved two Hawaiians. The trade was initially unpopular with Mets fans, however, it turned out to favor the Mets in the end, as Fernandez went on to be a staple of the Mets rotation for ten years. Diaz, meanwhile, lasted only two and a half seasons with the Dodgers before injuries cut short his career. He signed with the Oakland Athletics following the season, but was cut during Spring training . Diaz had a perfect career fielding percentage until the 12th inning of a fourteen-inning marathon against the San Diego Padres on June 21, . He misplayed a Tim Flannery ground ball for his only career error. Death Diaz died on September 28, 2015 in Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii. The cause of death was reportedly a heart attack. http://www.pressreader.com/ References External links * Baseball Almanac Major League Baseball pitchers Los Angeles Dodgers players New York Mets players Atlanta Braves players Richmond Braves players Baseball players from Hawaii Allan Hancock Bulldogs baseball players 1958 births 2015 deaths Bellingham Mariners players San Jose Missions players Spokane Indians players Albuquerque Dukes players ","title":"Carlos Diaz (pitcher)"},{"id":"12878005","text":"Geniostoma uninervium is a species of flowering plant in the Loganiaceae family.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Mueller originally signed as an infielder with the St. Louis Cardinals‚Äô organization. Before reaching the major leagues, Mueller played with Springfield in the Western Association and in 1935 and 1936 with Houston. In December 1937, the Cardinals sold Mueller to the Philadelphia Phillies. Mueller became the Phillies starting second baseman in 1938. In his major league debut on Opening Day, April 19, he became the first player in history to hit a leadoff home run in his first major league at-bat. No other Phillie would hit a leadoff homer on Opening Day until C√©sar Hern√°ndez in 2017. In four seasons with the Phillies, Mueller was primarily a second baseman (225 of his 441 games), but he also appeared as a pinch hitter, third baseman, outfielder, first baseman, and shortstop. In 441 major league games, Mueller collected 324 hits, scored 144 runs, knocked in 127 runs, walked 156 times, and stole 10 bases. He compiled a career batting average of .253 and a .337 on-base percentage. Mueller joined the U.S. Army shortly after Pearl Harbor. He was stationed at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, where he played baseball for the Reception Center Missions. A highlight at the time was playing for military all-star team which defeated an American League all-star team, 5‚Äì0, on July 7, 1942, at Cleveland‚Äôs Municipal Stadium before a crowd of 62,059. After the war, Mueller attended the Phillies spring training in 1946. Having missed four seasons to military service, Mueller did not make the cut and was released by the Phillies on April 22, 1946. He continued to play in the minor leagues and later became a minor league player-manager, including a stint with the Muskogee Reds in the Western Association in 1949. Mueller died in Orlando, Florida at age 74 in 1986. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Winter Garden, Florida.

Career A diminutive figure, standing just 5' 4\\" with size 6.5 boots although there was a myth that he wore size 3 boots, Hancocks played in the Wrekin Schools team before making his debut for hometown club Oakengates Town in the Birmingham League, aged just 15. In October 1938, he turned professional with Walsall of the Third Division South and played a full season of league football there. The outbreak of World War II halted his football career, as he joined the army in 1940 and became a physical training instructor. He did, however, manage to make several appearances for the army in representative games and also guested for Wrexham and Shrewsbury Town. With the resumption of league football, Hancocks was signed by First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers on 11 May 1946 for ¬£4,000, making his debut on 31 August 1946 in a 6-1 thrashing of Arsenal. He claimed his first goal for the club in another 6‚Äì1 victory on 12 October, against Huddersfield Town, and added 9 more in his debut season. The following season, he was even more prolific, finishing as joint top scorer (alongside Jesse Pye) with 16. Such form won him a call-up to the England team. He made his international debut on 2 December 1948 in a 6-0 hammering of Switzerland at Highbury, during which Hancocks scored twice. Despite his goalscoring debut, the likes of Stanley Matthews and Tom Finney saw him overlooked until October 1949 for his next cap (vs Wales), and he subsequently managed only one more cap (vs Yugoslavia in November 1950). Although international acclaim eluded him, Hancocks enjoyed success at club level as his goals helped fire Wolves to their first league title in 1953‚Äì54. Months later, he famously scored a penalty in a friendly against Budapest Honv√©d. He also collected an FA Cup winners medal in 1949, playing in the 3-1 final win over Leicester City, and later scored in the subsequent Charity Shield draw with Portsmouth. He finished as top goalscorer for the club in the 1954‚Äì55 and 1955‚Äì56 seasons. In total, Hancocks scored 168 goals for Wolves in 378 appearances, making him the fourth highest goalscorer in the club's history. His tally of 158 top- flight goals is still a club record. Despite his goals, he fell out of favour with manager Stan Cullis, and after the signing of Harry Hooper in 1956, he was relegated to the reserves. After a season out in the cold, he left the Molineux club to become player/manager of non-league Wellington Town in 1957. He took up the managerial reins in September 1959, and left the club later that year. He finished the 1959‚Äì60 season with Cambridge United. The following season, he spent spells at Oswestry Town then GKN Sankeys, before retiring in 1961, aged 42. After his playing career ended, he worked at the ironfounders Maddock & Sons in his native Oakengates, until taking retirement on his 60th birthday in 1979. He died on 19 February 1994 aged 74.

It is no longer an independent diocese, and is part of the Diocese of Montpellier. Traditionally, the first Bishop of B√©ziers is considered to be the Egyptian saint, Aphrodisius, said to have sheltered the Holy Family at Hermopolis and to have become a disciple of Christ, also to have accompanied Sergius Paulus to Gaul when the latter went thither to found the Church of Narbonne, and to have died a martyr at B√©ziers. Local traditions made St. Aphrodisius arrive at B√©ziers mounted on a camel. Hence the custom of leading a camel in the procession at B√©ziers on the feast of the saint; this lasted until the French Revolution but was revived in the late 20th century. The first historically known bishop is Paulinus mentioned in 418; St. Guiraud was Bishop of B√©ziers from 1121 to 1123; St. Dominic refused the See of B√©ziers to devote himself to the crusade against the Albigenses. Among the fifteen synods held at B√©ziers was that of 356 held by Saturninus of Arles, an Arian archbishop, which condemned Hilary of Poitiers. Later synods of 1233, 1246 and 1255 condemned the Cathars. A Papal Brief of 16 June 1877, authorized the bishops of Montpellier to call themselves bishops of Montpellier, B√©ziers, Agde, Lod√®ve and Saint-Pons, in memory of the different dioceses united in the present Diocese of Montpellier.

It first aired in the United States on Fox on November 16, 2008. This story centers around Hayley, who goes on a rampage shortly after Jeff breaks up with her. Stan and Francine try to help their daughter get through the grief, and Hayley begins dating Bill, Stan's body-double and doppelg√§nger. Meanwhile, Roger and Steve get summer jobs determining the sex of baby chicks in a factory, but Steve steals several specimens to rear in safety after learning their fate. Angered at their ruined summer, Roger steals the chickens to make money off of chicken fights. This episode was written by Brian Boyle and directed by John Aoshima. It received mixed reception from television critics upon its release, with much of the praise going on to the delivery of the main storyline. It features guest appearances from Mike Barker, Leslie Bega, Chris Diamantopoulos, Michael Dunn, Erik Durbin, Jon Fener, Jeff Fischer, Josh Gad, Steve Hely, Patrick Stewart, John Viener, Gedde Watanabe, and Keone Young. Plot Hayley and Jeff announce they are going to the mall. At the mall, Hayley goes on a destructive rampage after Jeff ends their relationship. Stan rushes to the mall and reprimands Jeff, explaining Hayley goes on a rampage every time a boyfriend breaks up with her. Stan eventually incapacitates her with tranquilizer darts and brings her home. He informs Francine that Hayley will go to jail if she goes on another rampage. To prevent this, he starts to dictate whom Hayley gets to date, airlifting guys she is interested in. Back home, Stan excuses himself to \\"feed Klaus\\". Realizing Klaus is supposed to fast for a blood test, Francine tries to stop him. On the way she sees Hayley and (apparently) Stan making out in Hayley's room. Downstairs she confronts Stan about this, who was actually sneaking off to steal cookie dough. Hayley appears with Bill, Stan's CIA body double, whom she was in fact making out with earlier. Hayley explains that ‚Äì angry at her father for his continued interference in her love life ‚Äì she threw a salad at Bill's face at the CIA cafeteria, mistaking him for Stan. After realizing her mistake, they started dating. Stan decides Bill is perfect for Hayley. While the four of them are at the beach, Stan brags to Bill about how hot Francine is. This leads Bill ‚Äì posing as Stan ‚Äì to later attempt to sleep with her in the bedroom. Angered, Stan defenestrates him and threatens to kill him if he ever sees Hayley again. They are then unable to explain Bill's sudden absence to Hayley, as if she knows Bill attempted to sleep with her mother, or thinks he dumped her, she will go on a rampage. Stan disguises himself as Bill for a romantic weekend getaway with Hayley. He tells Francine that if \\"Bill\\" annoys her enough, Hayley will dump him. At the hotel, Stan attempts to convince her to break up with him, such as by making her carry all the bags, but this excites her, much to his fear as she wants to go \\"all the way\\" with him. He takes her to the middle of a forest, where she complains that her father never says he loves her. Still acting as Bill, Stan assures her that her father loves her. Relieved, Hayley calls Stan, ringing his cell phone and revealing the ruse. Enraged, she burns down the forest. Meanwhile, Roger convinces Steve to go to Chinatown for their \\"summer of exotic adventure\\". The latter acquires a summer job of determining the sex of baby chicks and takes the former with him. But Roger is disappointed because he wanted a memorable summer vacation with him rather than working. When he learns the male chicks are being made into slurry, Steve rescues as many as he can, confines them in a tool shed, and raises them to adulthood. However, Roger kidnaps the chickens and holds a cockfight as way to earn extra money, much to Steve's anger. Steve makes a deal with Roger that the winner of the fight gets to keep the chickens. After a brief skirmish, Steve frees the whole brood, who all run into the street, where they are fatally struck by oncoming cars. Roger proceeds to clock Steve with a folding chair when he mourns. Reception \\"Pulling Double Booty\\" was met with mixed response from television critics and fans alike. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave it a positive review, going on to write, \\"I never thought I'd be writing the following words: I‚Ä¶thought they did an okay job with the whole \\"incest\\" thing. Yeah, Hayley falls for a guy who's Stan's exact double, but Francine's reenactment of prison shanking [...], Stan and Hayley's uncomfortable dinner and even Stan's momentary excitement that Hayley had found someone of whom he [...] approved worked in the episode's favor. They didn't hammer us with the Stan-lookalike aspect, only played it for maximum [...] comedic effect.\\" Heisler also praised the subplot of the episode, saying, \\"I enjoyed Steve's momentary career as a chicken sexer, complete with Roger's cock-fighting hijack‚Äìwow, I guess I never thought I'd be writing those words either.\\" He went on to give the episode a B-, the lowest grade of the night, tying with King of the Hill episode \\"A Bill Full of Dollars\\", but scoring lower than The Simpsons episode \\"Homer and Lisa Exchange Cross Words\\" and Family Guy episode \\"Tales of a Third Grade Nothing\\". The Parents Television Council, a conservative media watchdog group that are frequent critics of American Dad, as well as all other television programs produced by Seth MacFarlane - including Family Guy and The Cleveland Show - named \\"Pulling Double Booty\\" the \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" for the week of November 22, 2008. In a negative review for the episode, the group criticized the episode for \\"sexually explicit dialogue and a nauseating incestuous plot\\", and went on to write, \\"So far, nothing has been more disturbing than the repugnant plot of the November 16th [...] episode of American Dad.\\" In conclusion of their review, they wrote, \\"Thankfully, Stan never sleeps with his own daughter. And technically, sleeping with Bill wouldn‚Äôt have been incest. Yet, no amount of hair-splitting will make this episode any less cringe-inducing.\\" References External links  2008 American television episodes American Dad!

It consists of clayey, silty, very shelly, glauconitic sand. Fossil records indicate that this stratigraphic unit was created during the Paleocene. The Aquia formation was named for Aquia Creek where it is exposed in cliff faces along the banks. Geology =Lithology= When uncovered, it appears dark green to gray- green, argillaceous, with well sorted fine- to medium-grained sand and locally indurated shell beds. It occurs between 0 and 100 feet thick. Quartz and phosphatic pebbles and/or very coarse glauconitic quartz sand mark the base of the unit. A few hard streaks of shells or thin \\"rock\\" layers are often reported but appear to be more abundant in the sections south of the James River. =Stratigraphy= The Aquia formation is overlain by the Nanjemoy Formation and overlies the Brightseat Formation.

The three-episode series, directed by Nadia Tass, was an international coproduction between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. It starred Ben Elton and Jacqueline McKenzie. Production The budget for the series was A$7 million, with most of the money coming from the BBC. Elton wrote the script adapted from his own novel, as well as taking the starring role as \\"whinging Pom\\" CD.An Interview with Ben Elton, Stark DVD, July 2007. =Cast= * Ben Elton as CD (Colin Dobson) * Jacqueline McKenzie as Rachel O'Donoghue * Colin Friels as Sly Morgan * Deborra-Lee Furness as Chrissie * Derrick O'Connor as Zimmerman * Bill Wallis as Walter * Bill Hunter as Ocker Tyron * John Neville as Lord De Quincey =Locations= Although Stark is primarily set in Western Australia, the series was filmed in two other Australian states: Victoria and South Australia. Desert scenes, which make up much of the later episodes, were filmed in and around Coober Pedy. Broadcast Stark was first aired by the ABC in Australia over two nights on 11 and 12 August (the first and second episodes were edited together into one movie-length episode; the third episode aired as the second and final episode in Australia). The series did not air in the United Kingdom until it appeared on BBC2 on Wednesday nights from 8‚Äì22 December. Differences between the series and the novel The main changes from the plot of the novel were the extent of the Stark Consipiracy's plan, and the ending. In the novel, Rachel escapes from Stark just prior to the launch, the Star Arks land at their moonbase and the conspirators are quickly consumed by their own greed, selfishness and hatred, with Sly eventually committing suicide. In the series, Lord de Quincy intends to scuttle a fleet of 'leper ships' carrying toxic waste, to actually hasten the extinction of the human species. Sly boards the rocket with Rachel, who has fallen in love with him, and the pair stage a mutiny, although they are killed when the Star Arks are shot down by the United States Air Force. In an interview included on the DVD edition, Elton states that this change was suggested by producer Michael Wearing, who was concerned that the novel lacked a \\"jeopardy point\\". Several of the main characters' names are also changed in the series: Sly Moorcock was renamed Sly Morgan, and Lord Playing is renamed Lord De Quincey.

The 60th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 5, 2008. In the episode, Roger's credit card is maxed out and he is certain it is identity theft. He vows revenge and discovers that a man named Sidney Huffman is responsible. When he is about to burn down Sidney's apartment, he realizes that Sidney is not who he seems to be. Meanwhile, the rest of the Smith family gets sucked into a game of Simon. The episode was written by Chris and Matt McKenna and directed by Tim Parsons. It was the first episode to have a Roger-centric main story. The episode's story came from the writer's obsession with The Big Lebowski, and the original concept would include Jeff Lebowski being Roger's alter ego. \\"The One That Got Away\\" received positive reviews from critics and was viewed by 6.85 million viewers in its original airing. The episode features guest performances of Diane Delano, John DiMaggio and J.K. Simmons. Plot The episode begins with the family staging an intervention with Roger about his alcoholism. They also express concern that he may have an inferiority complex because he spends so much time in disguises. Roger dismisses their concerns, but shortly afterwards discovers that someone has maxed out his credit card. Vowing revenge, he discovers that someone named Sidney Huffman is responsible. Roger begins to destroy Sidney's life by ruining his employment and telling lies to Huffman's girlfriend Judy Panawits, resulting in her breaking off the relationship. He then sneaks into Sidney's apartment one night, and begins pouring fuel everywhere, intending to burn the apartment to the ground. However, just as he lights a match, Roger sees a photograph of Sidney and Judy, which shows that Sidney and Roger are the same person and Roger is shocked at the thought of one of his personas has taken on a life of his own. In a flashback from four days earlier, Sidney wakes up in bed feeling hungover, despite refraining from alcohol. He is shown to be a humble and polite Bible salesman, soon to be proposing to Judy. However over the next few days he discovers the trail of destruction that Roger has set for him. Calling Roger to beg him to stop, Sidney only encounters an abusive message, and realizes that Roger is not going to stop until he is done with Sidney. The scene then returns to the point where Roger realized that he and Sidney were the same person. At this point a hitman, hired by Sidney, enters and attempts to kill Roger. Desperate, Roger locates Judy at her department store workplace, and admits to her that he is both Roger and Sidney together. While trying to determine what the password was to call off the hit, the hitman enters the store and takes aim at Roger again. Roger hides in a dressing room while the hitman threatens Judy. Glad of the distraction, Roger attempts to make an escape but is stopped when he is confronted by his Sidney personality in the mirror. The Sidney persona is adamant that his feelings are just as valid as Rogers, despite Roger's attempts to convince him otherwise by using a pair of black leather gloves they each had one part of. When Sidney points out that he bought those gloves the same day he met Judy, Roger suddenly remembers how this split-personality came about - it was part of a convoluted scheme to steal the gloves from Judy's department store. He spent $700 to buy a necklace as part of the plan to get the $10 pair of gloves. To do this he took out a credit card in the name of Sidney, which was the name the employees at the store knew him by. But after the theft was discovered and Judy was fired for it, Roger's guilt forced the personality split, causing him to live as \\"clean\\" Sidney through the daytime, and his normal self at night-times. Admitting all of this to Sidney, Roger accepts Sidney's suggestion that together they can bring out the best in each other. They embrace, and Sidney calls out the correct password (which was password1) to the hitman, stopping the hit. Roger then stabs Sidney in the back with a dagger, causing the death of his persona as Sidney disappears (along with the dagger on his back). He confronts Judy, and decides to resume his relationship with her, but as Roger this time. The episode ends with them walking off together, hand in hand with Judy revealing she is a hermaphrodite. Meanwhile, the rest of the family becomes obsessed with playing a game of Simon. Unable to move, even to eat or relieve themselves, Klaus rescues them by setting off a smoke bomb, causing both the Simon game and Klaus himself to disappear. Seconds later Klaus re-appears, fighting and killing a monster from another dimension. Klaus then says that he was gone for sixty years to him and asks how long it had been back at home. Production \\"The One That Got Away\\" was written by Chris and Matt McKenna and directed by Tim Parsons. Jennifer Graves served as the assistant director. Co-creator Mike Barker considered it \\"maybe our most ambiguous episode to date\\", being the first episode to feature just Roger in the A-story. It was also the first nonlinear episode they had done, with Chris McKenna noting that the second act takes place in the same place as the first. Chris and Matt McKenna came up with the storyline via their \\"obsession\\" with The Big Lebowski, imagining how funny it would be if someone urinated on Roger's rug and then he had to figure out who had come after him. Jeff Lebowski would turn out to be an alter ego of Roger, and that got them thinking of storylines involving Roger and his multiple personas, and if \\"one of them got away.\\" The original story for the episode was that Roger would wake up in Shanghai and in trouble, caused by an evil persona. Chris and Matt McKenna pitched it to Barker, who declined it. They later rewrote it, this time making his persona \\"the good guy\\", and the opposite of Roger. Director Tim Parsons tried to make a difference between Roger's world and his alter ego Sidney's world, making the colors in Sidney's world \\"pastelly\\" and the backgrounds softer. Co-creator Seth MacFarlane, who provides the voice of Roger, also provided the voice of Sidney. MacFarlane is often very busy and does not have time to read the script before the table read. However, before voicing Sidney, the producers asked him if he could read the script the night before, to come up with a voice that sounded like an \\"old-fashioned Dick Powell.\\" Rachael MacFarlane provided the voice of Judy Panawits. Diane Delano, John DiMaggio and J.K. Simmons guest starred in the episode. Reception In its original broadcast on October 5, 2008, \\"The One That Got Away\\" was viewed by 6.85 million viewers, according to the Nielsen ratings. It finished first in its timeslot, acquiring a 3.5 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The episode finished third in total viewership among the shows in the \\"Animation Domination\\" lineup on Fox. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club enjoyed the Roger story, but criticized the B-story involving the Smiths and Klaus, saying that it \\"didn't fit with what was going on, and thus distracted from the story.\\" However, he praised the episode for being \\"great, albeit slightly imperfect\\" and \\"surprisingly solid\\" to be a Roger-centric story. He gave the episode a B rating, the best grade of the night, beating the Family Guy, King of the Hill and The Simpsons. While reviewing the American Dad! Volume 4 DVD set, Thomas Spurlin of DVD Talk, wrote that the episode, alongside \\"Spring Break-Up\\" and \\"Escape from Pearl Bailey\\", \\"deliver[s] laughs [...] along with offering bizarrely compelling stories in their compact time.\\" Also reviewing the DVD set, Clark Douglas of DVD Verdict deemed the episode to be one of the highlights.

On July 1, 1948, the Konan line was electrified at 600 VDC. The line was extended to Kuroishi Station by July 1, 1950. On July 25, 1949 the was established, and connected ≈åwani Station with Chuo-Hirosaki Station by January 26, 1952. Voltage on the line was raised from 600 VDC to 750 VDC on April 1, 1954 and to 1500 VDC on September 1, 1961. On October 1, 1970, the Hirosaki Electric Railway was acquired by the K≈çnan Railway Company, and its line became the K≈çnan Railway ≈åwani Line. On November 1, 1984 the former Japan National Railway Kuroshi Line was privatized by the government and acquired by the K≈çnan Railway Company, becoming the K≈çnan Railway Kuroishi Line, but was subsequently closed in 1998.

A rocca (literally: \\"rock\\") is a type of Italian fortified stronghold or fortress, typically located on a hilltop, beneath or on which the inhabitants of a historically clustered village or town might take refuge at times of trouble. Generally under its owners' patronage, the settlement might hope to find prosperity in better times. A rocca might in reality be no grander than a fortified farmhouse. A more extensive rocca would be referred to as a castello. The rocca in Roman times would more likely be a site of a venerable cult than a dwelling, like the high place of Athens, its Acropolis. Though the earliest documentation is not earlier than the eleventh century, it was during the Lombard times that farming communities, which had presented a Roman pattern of loosely distributed farmsteads or self-sufficient Roman villa, moved from their traditional places on the fringes of the best arable lands in river valleys, where they were dangerously vulnerable from the Roman roads, to defensive positions, such as had once been occupied by Etruscan settlements, before the settled conditions of the Pax Romana. Historian J.B. Ward-Perkins made the following observation regarding the rocca at the town of Falerii.J.B. Ward-Perkins, \\"Etruscan Towns, Roman Roads and Medieval Villages: The Historical Geography of Southern Etruria\\" The Geographical Journal 128.4 (December 1962:389-404) pp 399ff. Ward-Perkins notes the establishment of a villa of Roman pattern as late as ca 780, Pope Hadrian I's recently rediscovered Domusculta Capracorum near Veii, which Ward-Perkins does not take as exceptional but as evidence \\"that the system of land tenure operating in the territory of Veii at the end of the eighth century was still one of villas and large, open estates on the late Roman model\\" (Ward-Perkins 1962:402); villages were carved out of the former estate in the tenth century. Similarly, in Greek-speaking Campania, the inhabitants of Paestum finally abandoned their town after raids by Saracens and moved a few miles to the top of a cliff, calling the new settlement Agropoli (i.e., \\"acropolis\\"). Where such fortress villages were sited at the end of a ridge, protected on three sides by steep, cliff-like escarpments, the rocca was often sited to control the narrow access along the crest of the spur. Locally the term la rocca simply designates the local fortified high place. Examples Specific examples show the range of structures that may be called a rocca: *Rocca Sanvitale, began in the 13th century, mostly completed by the 15th century, is a remarkable fortress house in the town of Fontanellato, near Parma. *Rocca Flea is a fortified palazzo in Gualdo Tadino, Umbria. *In Valletta, Malta, Casa Rocca Piccola is one of the last remaining unconverted palazzi, that is still lived in today by a noble family. *In Sardinia, the Rocca Doria, a stronghold of the Doria of Genoa, gives its name to the commune Monteleone Rocca Doria. From the earliest stage, when church and rocca were the only stone structuresWard-Perkins 1962:401 points out that the familiar \\"medieval\\" character of surviving villages, with their cobbled streets and stone houses washed with colorful intonaco, upon examination are invariably structures built in the sixteenth century and later. \\"the distinction between 'castles' and 'villages' is already one of degree rather than kind.\\" (Ward-Perkins 1962:401) Their protective rocca has extended its name to many other small communities: *Roccacasale is located in the Province of L'Aquila in the Abruzzo. *Rocca di Papa in the region called Castelli Romani in the hills surrounding Lazio has given its name to its comune. Twelfth-century documents name the Castrum Rocce de Papa (\\"Rock Castle of the Pope\\"), because here lived Pope Eugene III. *Rocca Sinibalda, a comune in the Province of Rieti in Lazio, is located about 50 km northeast of Rome. *Rocca Canterano, Rocca Priora, Rocca Massima, Rocca di Cave, Rocca Santo Stefano, Rocca d'Arce are also in Lazio. *Rocca Grimalda in the Province of Alessandria, Piedmont was a nest of bandits in the eighteenth century.

Biography Miksha was born in a farm house in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, one of ten children in a poor rural family living along the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. The family survived by growing potatoes, corn, cabbage, and by keeping bees and selling honey. Miksha learned beekeeping from his parents and older brothers. In 1975, at age twenty-one, he moved to Saskatchewan, Canada to keep bees. His popular book, Bad Beekeeping, describes the ten years Miksha lived and farmed in Val Marie, Saskatchewan, a remote prairie village surrounded by badlands and large cattle ranches. The area, part of the Palliser Triangle, is prone to extreme drought as depicted in Miksha's book. But Bad Beekeeping is more than a beekeeping narrative. It espouses a strong libertarian '\\"small government\\" philosophy and has been both condemned and praised by readers on opposite ends of that discussion. In Hivelights Magazine, Grant Hicks, Alberta representative to the Canadian Honey Council, claims \\"Bad Beekeeping is the most impressive piece of beekeeping information that has come my way.\\"Hivelights, Grant Hicks, November 2005. The book has been influential abroad - the Norwegian heavy metal band Miksha (Half the Battle) derived its name from the book and its author.http://www.miksha.net Official Website of the Band Miksha Following ten years of Saskatchewan beekeeping, Ron Miksha studied at the University of Saskatchewan, graduating with high honours in geophysics. His undergraduate research work, sponsored by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, investigated the atmosphere's effects on the Earth's inner core vibrations.Geophysical Journal International, June 1992, Vol. 109 Issue 3, Page 488, Atmospheric pressure and gravity, J. B. Merriam. His research work and studies led to a business in Calgary, where Miksha now lives. In 1998, Ron Miksha began The Beekeeper's Home Pages, one of the first, and according to Google, the most popular website for beekeeping. Dr. Tom Sanford, apiculture specialist for the University of Florida wrote \\"this web site gets a grade A for its effort to be the definitive web site for beekeeping.\\"Bee Culture Magazine, January 2000, Tom Sanford. Miksha is also a contributor to Bee Culture, American Bee Journal, and Hivelights. In 2005, with his brother Don and other family members, Ron Miksha formed Summit Gardens Honey Farms Ltd., Canada's largest producer of comb honey. Summit Gardens is located near Milo, Alberta. In addition to beekeeping, Miksha also works in Earth Science. In 2007, he made two trips to Lima, Peru, South America, for the Canadian International Development Agency to teach aspects of geophysics and wrote The Mountain Mystery, a history of plate tectonics theory, in 2014.

Most animal testing involves invertebrates, especially Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, and Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode. These animals offer scientists many advantages over vertebrates, including their short life cycle, simple anatomy and the ease with which large numbers of individuals may be studied. Invertebrates are often cost-effective,Andre, RG, RA Wirtz, and YT Das (1989). \\"Insect Models for Biomedical Research\\" .

Retrieved November 13, 2008. as thousands of flies or nematodes can be housed in a single room. With the exception of some cephalopods, invertebrate species are not protected under most animal research legislation, and therefore the total number of invertebrates used remains unknown. Main uses Research on invertebrates is the foundation for current understanding of the genetics of animal development. C. elegans is especially valuable as the precise lineage of all the organism's 959 somatic cells is known, giving a complete picture of how this organism goes from a single cell in a fertilized egg, to an adult animal. The genome of this nematode has also been fully sequenced and any one of these genes can easily be inactivated through RNA interference, by feeding the worms antisense RNA. A major success in the work on C. elegans was the discovery that particular cells are programmed to die during development, leading to the discovery that programmed cell death is an active process under genetic control. The simple nervous system of this nematode allows the effects of genetics on the development of nerves to be studied in detail. However, the lack of an adaptive immune system and the simplicity of its organs prevent C. elegans from being used in medical research such as vaccine development. The fly D. melanogaster is the most widely used animal in genetic studies. This comes from the simplicity of breeding and housing the flies, which allows large numbers to be used in experiments. Molecular biology is relatively simple in these organisms and a huge variety of mutant and genetically modified flies have been developed. Fly genetics has been vital in the study of development, the cell cycle, behavior, and neuroscience. The similarities in the basic biochemistry of all animals allows flies to be used as simple systems to investigate the genetics of conditions such as heart disease and neurodegenerative disease. However, like nematodes, D. melanogaster is not widely used in applied medical research, as the fly immune system differs greatly from that found in humans, and diseases in flies can be very different from diseases in humans. Other uses of invertebrates include studies on social behavior.

The Matis are commonly named as the Jaguar people. They live in two separate villages with total population of roughly 290. They live in the far west of Brazil, in the Vale do Javari Indigenous Territory, an area covering . They practice both hunting and agriculture. Language The Matis language belongs to the Panoan family from the Amazonian area of Brazil. Recent history Before contact, the Matis assumed passenger airplanes were xokeke, the spirits of their ancestors. They also assumed bush planes were binkeke, a kind of strange demon-bird. This tribe saw the two kinds of airplanes as distinct phenomena, since passenger planes would appear to be smaller than the bush planes (which fly closer to the ground).The Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon's Lost Tribes, First Edition, Crown Publishers, United States, 2011, p. 229 The Matis tribe were first contacted by the Brazilian agency FUNAI during 1975-1976, although it was not until two years later in 1978 that FUNAI employees began visiting the then-five Matis villages, after Matis men overcame their fears about visiting the FUNAI station. The 1980s proved difficult for the tribe, with the arrival of Western disease killing roughly a third of their population, devoid of natural immunity or any remedies for them. In 1981, over 50 Matis people died of disease, so the survivors moved to the Itu√≠ River. By 1983, only 87 Matis people survived. The decade also saw the loss of three of their villages which now, completely abandoned, are occasionally visited by the Matis to harvest fruit trees. Time has probably given the Matis a better understanding of events surrounding and following their first contact over 30 years ago. Whereas elder Matis traditionalists are keen to retain and in some cases readopt their old way of life, the younger Matis have been influenced by the modern outside world and want closer ties with modern Brazil, particularly for education. On October 31, 2009, members of the Matis tribe located nine survivors of a plane crash near the Itu√≠ River and then contacted the Brazilian Air Force.

It was intended as a safe haven for Jewish children under the Holocaust, yet all the children eventually had to flee to avoid deportation when Norway itself was occupied by Nazi Germany. The first director, Nina Hasvold (n√©e Hackel), was recruited by Norwegian psychiatrist Nic Waal after they had become acquainted in Berlin while attending the Kinderseminar (Seminar on Children) run by Wilhelm Reich. Nansenhjelpen board member Sigrid Helliesen Lund was also active in establishing the home. The first inhabitants of the home were Jewish refugees from Vienna (known as Wienerbarna, \\"the Vienna children\\"), who had arrived in June 1938 on the pretext of a summer vacation with the Norwegian Jewish community. After some time at the Jewish community's cabin at Skui in B√¶rum and in foster care, they moved into rented facilities in Industrigaten and finally into a building the Jewish community had acquired at Holbergsgate 21 in Oslo. Through the work of recently arrived psychiatrist Leo Eitinger and Nora Lustig (who was later detained and deported, and immediately murdered in Auschwitz) from Brno, Nansenhjelpen applied on humanitarian grounds to admit 100 Czech Jewish children who otherwise faced a grim future under the Nazi regime. The ministry of justice only reluctantly approved the application for a few (among them the noted psychiatrist Berthold Gr√ºnfeld), on the grounds that it would be \\"difficult to get rid of them.\\" When Norway was occupied by Nazi Germany, conditions progressively worsened for the Norwegian Jewish community in general and also for the inhabitants of the Jewish children's home. Though Sigrid Helliesen Lund had the foresight to burn the entire list of Czech Jewish refugees on April 9, 1940, German and Quisling authorities eventually caught up with the home. Seven children were sent back to their families in Austria; all of these perished in the Holocaust. In addition, one boy who moved out of the home in October 1942 was murdered in Auschwitz. By the time the Nazi authorities ordered the detention and deportation of all Jews in Norway in November 1942, there were nine boys and five girls in the home. The staff at the home, individuals affiliated with Nansenhjelpen, and other helpful people with contacts within the generally unhelpful Norwegian resistance movement planned, improvised, and successfully carried out a complicated and daring escape. All the children in the home were able to evade capture and found their way to Sweden. All 14 children survived the Holocaust and subsequently found new homes in Norway, Sweden, Argentina, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In the summer of 2007, all were still alive. Recognition  Of those who participated in the rescue effort, seven were honored as being among the Righteous among the Nations through Yad Vashem in 2006: * Caroline (Nic) Waal, who orchestrated the escape, relying on her personal network of friends and family. * Nina Hasvold, the director of the orphanage. * Gerda Tanberg, who hid the children in her second floor apartment in Ullern. * Martin Solvang, a taxi driver who was very active in the underground railroad to Sweden, and drove the children to Elverum. * Ola Rauken, a border guide, who took the children into his farm and walked them 17 kilometers toward the border. * Ola Breisj√∏berget, who took them across the border. * Sigrid Helliesen Lund, a member of Sivorg who dedicated herself from the outset to saving the children's lives, planning the escape and arranging for provisions.

It is a web application ‚Äì a so-called Learning Management System that supports any kind of online learning, teaching, and tutoring with few educational restrictions. OLAT is free software and is open-source. Its development started in 1999 at the University of Z√ºrich and OLAT won the MeDiDa-Prix prize in 2000. With version 3.0, the system was completely rebuilt and is now available as a component- oriented application developed in the Java programming language. OLAT has support for various E-learning standards such as IMS (IMS Content Packaging, IMS QTI), and SCORM. With version 4.0, many add-ons have been introduced to the system, which makes it very easy to extend the LMS functionality. With version 5.0, new features like Wiki, Calendar, AJAX Beta Mode, and Fulltext Search have been implemented. Version 6.0 comprised a new and improved layout based on a usability evaluation. A subsequent version provides full scalability, meaning OLAT can be run on a cluster of servers. OLAT 7.0 adds many new features, a course wizard plus the implementation of important standards like REST API, IMS Basic LTI and IMS QTI 2.1. In autumn 2011 some of the core community contributors left the OLAT community because of strategic differences and started an alternative fork which is named OpenOLAT.  Features  OLAT has many features typical for e-learning platforms: * Content managing * Forums * File discussions * Quizzes with different kinds of questions * Wikis * Blogs * Podcast * Surveys * Chat * Submission module (for exercises) * Grading module * Time marker for video data * Scalability: OLAT can be run as a cluster * Multi-language support (OLAT is multilingual and available in many languages; full support for UTF-8) * OLAT integrates the instant messaging system XMPP to support the synchronous communication processes and to extend the users' awareness.  Current status and future development  As the strategic LMS of the University of Z√ºrich, OLAT is continuously being developed. In the meantime, OLAT gains increasingly more attention, especially within the European higher education market. OLAT and the Sakai Project have very similar goals, but compared to the American initiative, OLAT has a much longer development phase and has been successfully in production for several years. OLAT has been developed from the beginning to support campus-wide E-learning and can be compared to commercial tools like WebCT Vista. OLAT is a mature LMS, used to support universities with thousands of users, e.g. University of Zurich with approx. 50,000, Bildungsportal Sachsen (under the name of OPAL) with approx. 40,000, University of Hamburg with approx. 30,000 and, as of the summer semester 2011, Goethe University Frankfurt with approx. 50,000 users.http://www.checkpoint- elearning.de/article/6450.html By the end of 2011 the OpenOLAT fork has been started as an alternative development line by the largest community contributor who by this initiative left the original OLAT community due to strategic differences. The common base of OLAT and OpenOLAT is the 7.1 release. From that point the two systems are heading into different directions. The first OpenOLAT release was published in February 2012 with the number 8.0.  Recognitions  *OLAT won the MedidaPrix 2000, which is the most important e-learning award in the German language area (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland). * OLAT won the Swiss Open Source Award 2008. * OLAT won in 2009 the IMS Learning Impact 'Leadership Award' 2009 for OLAT for best open source learning platform.http://www.imsglobal.org/pressreleases/pr090514.html  Specification  OLAT runs without modification on Unix, Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Windows, and Mac OS X.

It is a type of inland island. Lake islands may form a lake archipelago.  Formation  Lake islands may form in numerous ways. They may occur through a build-up of sedimentation as shoals, and become true islands through changes in the level of the lake. They may have been originally part of the lake's shore, and been separated from it by erosion, or they may have been left as pinnacles when the lake formed through a raising in the level of a river or other waterway (either naturally, or artificially through the damming of a river or lake). On creation of a glacial lake a moraine can form an island. They may also have formed through earthquake, meteor, or volcanic activity. In the latter case, crater or caldera islands exist, with new volcanic prominences in lakes formed in the craters of larger volcanoes. Other lake islands include ephemeral beds of floating vegetation, and islands artificially formed by human activity. =Volcanic crater and caldera lake islands= Caldera of Cuicocha in Ecuador Lakes may sometimes form in the circular depressions of volcanic craters. These craters are typically circular or oval basins around the vent or vents from which magma erupts. A large volcanic eruption sometimes results in the formation of a caldera, caused by the collapse of the magma chamber under the volcano. If enough magma is ejected, the emptied chamber is unable to support the weight of the volcano, and a roughly circular fracture, the ring fault, develops around the edge of the chamber. The centre of the volcano within the ring fracture collapses, creating a ring-shaped depression. Long after the eruption, this caldera may fill with water to become a lake. If volcanic activity continues or restarts, the centre of the caldera may be uplifted in the form of a resurgent dome, to become a crater lake island. Though typically calderas are larger and deeper than craters and form in different ways, a distinction between the two is often ignored in non-technical circumstances and the term crater lake is widely used for the lakes formed in both craters and calderas. The following is a list of large or notable crater lake islands: * Teodoro Wolf and Yerovi Islands in Cuicocha Lake, Ecuador * Teopan Island in Lake Coatepeque, El Salvador * Islas Quemadas in Lake Ilopango, El Salvador * Samosir Island in Lake Toba, Sumatra, Indonesia * Bisentina and Martana Islands in Lake Bolsena, Italy * Kamuishu Island in Lake Mash≈´, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan * Nakano Island in Lake T≈çya, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan * Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua, North Island, New Zealand * Motutaiko Island in Lake Taupo, North Island, New Zealand * Two islands in Lake Dakataua, in the caldera of Dakataua, West New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea * Volcano Island in Taal Lake, Luzon, Philippines (and Vulcan Point in Crater Lake on Volcano Island) * Samang, Chayachy, Serdtse (Heart), Nizkii (Low), and Glinyanii (Clay) Islands in Kurile Lake, Kamchatka, Russia * Lahi, Molemole, Si'i, and A'ali Islands in Lake Vai Lahi, Niuafo'ou, Tonga * Meke Daƒüƒ± Island in Meke Golu crater lake, Turkey * Horseshoe Island (now submerged) in Mount Katmai's crater lake, Alaska, United States * Wizard Island and Phantom Ship in Crater Lake, Oregon, United States =Impact crater islands= Impact craters, formed by the collision of large meteorites or comets with the Earth, are relatively uncommon, and those which do exist are frequently heavily eroded or deeply buried. Several, however, do contain lakes. Where the impact crater is complex, a central peak emerges from the floor of the crater. If a lake is present, this central peak may break the water's surface as an island. In other cases, other geological processes may have caused only a ring-shaped annular lake to remain from an impact, with a large central island taking up the remaining area of the crater. The world's largest impact crater island (and the world's second-largest lake island of any kind) is Ren√©-Levasseur Island, in Lake Manicouagan, Canada. The Sanshan Islands of Lake Tai, China, are also examples of impact crater islands, as are the islands in Canada's Clearwater Lakes, and the Slate Islands of Lake Superior, also in Canada. Soller√∂n Island in Siljan Lake, Sweden, and an unnamed island in Lake Karakul, Tajikistan, was also formed by meteor impact. =Floating islands= The Uru people have lived on the Uros floating islands on Lake Titicaca for centuries The term floating island is sometimes used for accumulations of vegetation free-floating within a body of water. Due to the lack of currents and tides, these are more frequently found in lakes than in rivers or the open sea. Peaty masses of vegetable matter from shallow lake floors may rise due to the accumulation of gases during decomposition, and will often float for a considerable time, becoming ephemeral islands until the gas has dissipated enough for the vegetation to return to the lake floor. =Artificial islands= Artificial or man-made islands are islands constructed by human activity rather than formed by natural means. They may be totally created by humans, enlarged from existing islands or reefs, formed by joining small existing islands, or cut from a mainland (for example, by cutting through the isthmus of a peninsula). Artificial islands have a long history, dating back to the crannogs of prehistoric Britain and Ireland, and the traditional floating Uru islands of Lake Titicaca in South America. Notable early artificial islands include the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, at the site of modern Mexico City. Though technically caused by human activity, islands formed from hilltops by the deliberate flooding of valleys (such as in the creation of hydroelectricity projects and reservoirs) are not normally regarded as artificial islands. The artificial island of IJburg, Amsterdam, Netherlands Artificial islands are built for numerous uses, ranging from flood protection to immigration or quarantine stations. Other uses for reclaimed artificial islands include expansion of living space or transportation centres in densely populated regions. Agricultural land has also been developed through reclamation of polders in the Netherlands and other low lying countries. Notable modern examples of artificial lake islands include the Dutch polder of Flevopolder in Flevoland, the island of IJburg in Amsterdam, and Flamingo Island in Kamfers Dam, South Africa. At , Flevopolder, in the now-freshwater lake IJsselmeer, is the largest man-made island in the world.  Lists of lake islands  = Naturally occurring lake islands, by area = There are few naturally occurring lake islands with an area in excess of . Of these, five are located in the large Great Lakes of North America, three are located in the large African Great Lakes, one is located in the largest lake in Central America, one was formed by the world's fourth largest meteorite impact, and one is located in the largest (by volume) lake in the world.Coast of Olkhon Island on Lake Baikal # Manitoulin Island in Lake Huron, Canada ‚Äì # Ren√©-Levasseur Island in the Manicouagan Reservoir, Quebec, Canada ‚Äì .

Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species, due to their availability, size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. __TOC__ Statistics In the UK in 2015, there were 3.33 million procedures on rodents (80% of total procedures that year). The most common species used were mice (3.03 million procedures, or 73% of total) and rats (268,522, or 6.5%). Other rodents species included guinea pigs (21,831 / 0.7%), hamsters (1,500 / 0.04%) and gerbils (278 / 0.01%).\\"Annual Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals, Great Britain, 2015 Home Office In the U.S., the numbers of rats and mice used are not reported, but estimates range from around 11 millionUS Statistics, 2014 - Speaking of Research to approximately 100 million. In 2000, the Federal Research Division, Library of Congress, published the results of an analysis of its Rats/Mice/and Birds Database: Researchers, Breeders, Transporters, and Exhibitors. Rodent types =Mice= Mice are the most commonly used vertebrate species, popular because of their availability, size, low cost, ease of handling, and fast reproduction rate. Mice are quick to reach sexual maturity, as well as quick to gestate, where labs can have a new generation every three weeks as well as a relatively short lifespan of two years. They are widely considered to be the prime model of inherited human disease and share 99% of their genes with humans.The Measure Of Man, Sanger Institute Press Release, 5 December 2002 With the advent of genetic engineering technology, genetically modified mice can be generated to order and can cost hundreds of dollars each. Transgenic animal production consists of injecting each construct into 300‚Äì350 eggs, typically representing three days' work. Twenty to fifty mice will normally be born from this number of injected eggs. These animals are screened for the presence of the transgene by a polymerase chain reaction genotyping assay. The number of transgenic animals typically varies from two to eight. Chimeric mouse production consists of injecting embryonic stem cells provided by the investigator into 150‚Äì175 blastocysts, representing three days of work. Thirty to fifty live mice are normally born from this number of injected blastocysts. Normally, the skin color of the mice from which the host blastocysts are derived is different from that of the strain used to produce the embryonic stem cells. Typically two to six mice will have skin and hair with greater than seventy percent ES cell contribution, indicating a good chance for embryonic stem cell contribution to the germline. =Syrian hamsters= Syrian hamsters are used to model the human medical conditions including various cancers, metabolic diseases, non- cancer respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, infectious diseases, and general health concerns. In 2006-07, Syrian hamsters accounted for 19% of the total animal research participants in the United States. =Rats= Limitations While mice, rats and other rodents are by far the most widely used animals in biomedical research, recent studies have highlighted their limitations. For example, the utility of the use of rodents in testing for sepsis, burns, inflammation, stroke, ALS, Alzheimer‚Äôs, diabetes, cancer, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson‚Äôs disease and other illnesses has been called into question by a number of researchers. Regarding experiments on mice in particular, some researchers have complained that ‚Äúyears and billions of dollars have been wasted following false leads‚Äù as a result of a preoccupation with the use of these animals in studies. Mice differ from humans in several immune properties: mice are more resistant to some toxins than humans; have a lower total neutrophil fraction in the blood, a lower neutrophil enzymatic capacity, lower activity of the complement system, and a different set of pentraxins involved in the inflammatory process; and lack genes for important components of the immune system, such as IL-8, IL-37, TLR10, ICAM-3, etc. Laboratory mice reared in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions usually have a rather immature immune system with a deficit of memory T cells. These mice may have limited diversity of the microbiota, which directly affects the immune system and the development of pathological conditions. Moreover, persistent virus infections (for example, herpesviruses) are activated in humans, but not in SPF mice, with septic complications and may change the resistance to bacterial coinfections. ‚ÄúDirty‚Äù mice are possibly better suitable for mimicking human pathologies. In addition, inbred mouse strains are used in the overwhelming majority of studies, while the human population is heterogeneous, pointing to the importance of studies in interstrain hybrid, outbred, and nonlinear mice. An article in The Scientist notes, ‚ÄúThe difficulties associated with using animal models for human disease result from the metabolic, anatomic, and cellular differences between humans and other creatures, but the problems go even deeper than that‚Äù including issues with the design and execution of the tests themselves. For example, researchers have found that many rats and mice in laboratories are obese from excess food and minimal exercise which alters their physiology and drug metabolism. Many laboratory animals, including mice and rats, are chronically stressed which can also negatively affect research outcomes and the ability to accurately extrapolate findings to humans. Researchers have also noted that many studies involving mice, rats and other rodents are poorly designed, leading to questionable findings. One explanation for deficiencies in studies of rodents housed in laboratory cages is that they lack access to environmental agency and thus the ongoing freedom to make decisions and experience their consequences. By housing rodents under extreme impoverished conditions, these captive animals bear diminished resemblance to humans or their wild conspecifics.Lahvis, Garet (June 29, 2017). \\"Unbridle biomedical research from the laboratory cage\\". eLife: 1‚Äì10. doi:10.7554/eLife.27438. Some studies suggests that inadequate published data in animal testing may result in irreproducible research, with missing details about how experiments are done are omitted from published papers or differences in testing that may introduce bias. Examples of hidden bias include a 2014 study from McGill University in Montreal, Canada which suggests that mice handled by men rather than women showed higher stress levels. Another study in 2016 suggested that gut microbiomes in mice may have an impact upon scientific research.

Buck‚Äîshe was raised in Japan and writes novels that are set there, but lives in Manhattan surrounded by Japanese customs, art and furnishings. She is engaged to marry world-famous cancer researcher Dr. John MacClure. One day, the doctor's daughter, Eva, finds Karen with her throat cut in the writer's Greenwich Village home. Eva herself has no motive to kill Karen, but the evidence she finds at the scene suggests‚Äîeven in her own mind‚Äîthat no one else could have done it. The investigation by Ellery Queen confronts this puzzle and also turns up startling information about a long-vanished relative of Karen Leith. Queen pierces the veil of circumstantial evidence and finds out not only the method of the crime but, most importantly, its motivation. Literary significance and criticism After ten popular mystery novels and the first of many movies, the character of Ellery Queen was at this point firmly established. This period in the Ellery Queen canon signals a change in the type of story told, moving away from the intricate puzzle mystery format which had been a hallmark of nine previous novels, each with a nationality in their title and a \\"Challenge to the Reader\\" immediately before the solution was revealed. Both the \\"nationality title\\" and the \\"Challenge to the Reader\\" have disappeared from the novels at this point. \\"(Ellery Queen) gave up the Challenge and the close analysis of clues, and made Ellery a less omniscient and more human figure, in search of a wider significance and more interesting characterization. ... (The) first ten books represent a peak point in the history of the detective story between the wars.\\"Symons, Julian (revised edition, 1974).

It is used for total parenteral nutrition (feeding directly into a venous catheter), e.g. in short bowel syndrome. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It has gained popularity in children in preference to the more commonly used Intralipid after case reports that it reduced the risk of liver damage. A 2007 study indicated that the use of Omegaven may be an appropriate intervention strategy for newborns with a very low birth weight, gastrochisis, and jejunal atresia. It is currently undergoing a clinical trial at National Taiwan University Hospital. Although the use of fish oil triglycerides in children in the United States is experimental, the use of it in adults in Europe is less controversial.A Doctor's Push For Drug Pits Him Against Its Maker at The Wall Street Journal In European studies, fish oil triglycerides have been associated with a reduction in psoriasis, when contrasted to administration of omega-6 fatty acid Lipoven.

Mills High School is a public high school in Burlington, Connecticut. The school is part of Connecticut Regional School District 10 and serves the two towns of Burlington and Harwinton, which border one another. Until the opening of Lewis S. Mills High School, high school students in Burlington and Harwinton attended high school in neighboring towns, such as Farmington.  Name  After the completion of the school's construction in November 1960, a contest was held to determine a name for the newly built regional high school. Some of the proposed names for the school attempted to combine the names of the two towns that it served, which included \\"Har-Bur\\", a name latter adopted by the middle school. The name eventually decided upon for the school in the contest was \\"Lewis S. Mills High School\\", taking its name from Lewis S. Mills, a local educator and author who had managed schools in both Burlington and Harwinton during the 1910s and 1920s. A few weeks after the announcement of the school's naming, a dedication ceremony was held which featured the school's namesake.  Controversy  Lewis S. Mills High School was named in Doninger v. Niehoff, a civil rights lawsuit brought by (former student) Avery Doninger, against Principal Karissa Niehoff (now retired) and Superintendent (now retired) Paula Schwartz. In spring 2007, Doninger posted a blog entry criticizing the administration and encouraging students to email or call the school regarding the scheduling of Jamfest (a school event). She also referred to the administration as \\"douchebags\\". When the blog was discovered some weeks later by the superintendent's 36-year-old son, the administration banned Doninger from running for a class officer position. Doninger won by write-in, but the write-in votes were not recognized. Doninger lost a hearing for injunctive relief when district court Judge Mark Kravitz ruled that there was not a substantial likelihood that Doninger would win her case against the school and thus declined to grant the injunction. On May 29, 2008, a US Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that the administration had acted within the bounds of their authority. The court made the ruling not so much because of the \\"douchebags\\" comment, but because her encouragement of students to contact the administration could cause a \\"foreseeable risk of substantial disruption to the work and discipline of the school.\\" She had said on her blog that students could contact the Superintendent \\"to piss her off more\\". The court stressed that their decision was not an endorsement of schools regulating off-campus speech. Thomas Gerarde, representing the school district, was quick to assert that \\"any speech that is likely to come to the attention of administrators on campus, even though it‚Äôs off campus, will be subject to discipline if it‚Äôs disruptive.\\" Doninger and her mother have said that they will attempt to bring the case to jury trial. She graduated on June 20, 2008. On April 25, 2011, the US Second Circuit Court of Appeals (based in NYC) \\"ruled 3-0 that school administrators did not violate ‚Äúclearly established‚Äù First Amendment precedent.\\"  References  Burlington, Connecticut Schools in Hartford County, Connecticut Public high schools in Connecticut ","title":"Lewis S.

He played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the major leagues, and with the Chunichi Dragons and Kintetsu Buffaloes in Nippon Professional Baseball. He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and played outfield for most of his career. Career Born in Fort Gaines, Georgia, Bryant studied at Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College. He was drafted in the first round of the 1981 amateur draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, having previously been drafted by the Dodgers and Minnesota Twins, but did not sign with either team that year. Bryant was promoted to the major leagues for the first time in , but was unable to establish himself as a regular outfielder, and spent the next three years traveling back and forth between the major and minor leagues. In , the Chunichi Dragons of the Japanese Central League showed interest in Bryant, and he was shipped to Japan in May, 1988. On June 7, 1988, Dick Davis, the cleanup batter of the Kintetsu Buffaloes, was arrested on drug charges, and the Buffaloes were forced to let go of one of their best hitters mid-season. Unable to fill the offensive void left by Davis, the Buffaloes found Bryant, who was playing on the Dragons minor league team. After seeing Bryant blast a home run in a minor league game, the Buffaloes offered to purchase his contract. The Dragons minor league staff was opposed to the trade, but regulations allowed for only two non-Japanese players per team, and the Dragons already had Taiwanese baseball star Genji Kaku and slugger Gary Rajsich on their roster, leaving no room for Bryant. The purchase was finalized on June 28, giving birth to one of the best left-handed power hitters in Japanese baseball history. Bryant quickly established his presence with the Buffaloes, hitting 34 home runs in only 74 games to contribute to their huge comeback which put the team in a close second place to the Seibu Lions in 1988. Ironically, many Buffaloes home games that year were held in the Nagoya Baseball Stadium, the home field of the Chunichi Dragons. Bryant played his best season in , where his 49 home runs led the Buffaloes to their third Pacific League championship. He won the season MVP award that year, and also tied Sadaharu Oh's career record for hitting 3 home runs in a game 5 times. He continued his success in subsequent seasons, and retired in after missing most of that year due to injuries. He was invited back to Japan in by manager Akira Ogi as a hitting coach for the Orix Buffaloes. He left this job after only one year, but blasted three home runs in an inter-league home run contest during the season. Though he hit a large number of home runs throughout his career, he also struck out countless times, and holds the top four spots on the single-season strikeout records in Nippon Professional Baseball. Bryant was also the first player with MLB experience to strike out more than 200 times per season in both the Central League and Pacific League.

Early years Malcolm was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1940. He was educated in Canada and Australia (Sydney Church of England Grammar School), and then attended Wellington College and Victoria University of Wellington. He was the son of Joseph Anthony Malcolm, a New Zealand government official serving overseas. Malcolm's early career was as a social worker with the Child Welfare Division of the Department of Education in Wellington and Palmerston North but by the mid 1970s he was owner of Malcolm & Hansard Ltd, an accredited advertising agency in Auckland. Member of Parliament Malcolm became the member of parliament for the Eden electorate in 1975, defeating Mike Moore, remaining there until he was in turn defeated in 1984 by Richard Northey. =Cabinet Minister= Malcolm was a Cabinet Minister during the third term of the Muldoon National government, serving at various times as Associate Minister of Transport, Civil Aviation and Railways, Minister of Health, and Minister of Immigration. Rail As Associate to Colin McLachlan, Malcolm's focus was on New Zealand Railways. He managed the transition from government department to corporation, upgraded Wellington's commuter services with Hungarian built Ganz-Marvag electric units, electrified commuter services to Paraparaumu and commenced electrification of the main trunk line. Immigration Malcolm became involved with Immigration as Parliamentary Under Secretary to Jim Bolger in 1977 and continued, as Minister, until 1984. Malcolm made wide use of his ministerial discretion to stop dawn raid deportations when children or other exceptional circumstances were involved, laying the foundation for many Pacifica families now well settled in New Zealand. His response to the Indo- Chinese refugee crisis was the foundation for New Zealand refugee policies that persist to the present and are still well regarded internationally. For both approaches he received criticism from the political right. Later, by issuing visas to the 1981 Springboks, he received criticism from the political left. Malcolm was highly interventionist, making many individual case decisions and instituting policies some regarded as \\"quirky\\", at the time; such as permitting restaurants to employ ethnic chefs to improve cuisine; Chinese market gardeners to employ family members to replace their own children who were moving into the professions; the entry of skilled musicians and artists; and the first \\"entrepreneur\\" policy. Malcolm's liberalism saw an increase in non-white migration, especially as \\"special cases\\", but he persisted with the Eurocentric policy of only accepting mainstream occupational migrants from \\"traditional source\\" countries. After widespread review and submissions his new Immigration Bill was to undertake its second reading the night Muldoon announced the snap election in 1984. That legislation re-emerged later as the Labour-sponsored Immigration Act of 1987. Tobacco As the Minister of Health during the 1981‚Äì84 National government, Malcolm features in a 1985 tobacco industry document, a report written by a Tobacco Institute of America official who had visited New Zealand. The official was accompanied by Donald Hoel, a lawyer in the US law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon, who worked for the tobacco industry.

The alkali hydroxides are: *Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) *Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) *Potassium hydroxide (KOH) *Rubidium hydroxide (RbOH) *Caesium hydroxide (CsOH)  Production  Alkali hydroxides are formed in the reaction between alkali metals and water. A typical school demonstration demonstrates what happens when a piece of an alkali metal is introduced to a bowl of water. A vigorous reaction occurs, producing hydrogen gas and the specific alkali hydroxide. For example, if sodium is the alkali metal: :Sodium + water ‚Üí sodium hydroxide + hydrogen gas :2 Na + 2 H2O ‚Üí 2 NaOH + H2 Sodium hydroxide is an important industrial chemical, where it is produced by the chloralkali process.  Properties and uses  The alkali metal hydroxides form white crystals that are hygroscopic and readily soluble in water, generating large amounts of heat upon dissolution. The solubility increases down the column as the alkali metal ions become larger and the lattice enthalpies decrease. All alkali metal hydroxides are strong bases, meaning that they dissociate completely in solution to give ions. As strong bases, alkali hydroxides are highly corrosive and are used in cleaning products. Sodium hydroxide is readily available in most hardware stores in products such as a drain cleaner. Similarly, potassium hydroxide is available as a solution used for cleaning terraces and other areas made out of wood. Both NaOH and KOH are also used in the production of soap and detergents (saponification). Due to their hygroscopic properties, alkali hydroxides are used as desiccants. They also readily absorb carbon dioxide and are therefore used in carbon dioxide scrubbers.

In the southern front of the nationalist dominated region bordering the communist base in Shaanxi ‚Äì Gansu ‚Äì Ningxia, the communist controlled region in Guanzhong had formed a bulge that the nationalists had long planned to eliminate. The communist base in Guanzhong posed a serious threat to both Guanzhong and eastern Gansu, and also threatened the flank of the nationalist force in their planned attack on the communist capital, Yan'an. Nationalists had a total of two divisions, totaling six brigades in the region and decided to eliminate the communist base in Guanzhong first. Order of battle *Nationalist (8,100 total) 48th Brigade of the Reorganized 17th Division 123rd Brigade of the Reorganized 36th Division 135th Brigade of the Reorganized 15th Division Two security regiments *Communist (3,700 total) Newly Organized 4th Brigade 3rd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade 7th Regiment of the 3rd Garrison Brigade On December 31, 1946, nationalist forces consisting of the 48th Brigade of the Reorganized 17th Division, the 123rd Brigade of the Reorganized 36th Division, the 135th Brigade of the Reorganized 15th Division and two security regiments launched their offensive against the communist base in Guanzhong, succeeding in taking regions including Xipodian (Ë•øÂù°Â∫ó), Gongjiaxie (Â∑©ÂÆ∂Êñú), Changshetou (ÈïøËàåÂ§¥), and Wuwangshan (Ê≠¶ÁéãÂ±±). The communists, in response, decided to counterattack with their Newly Organized 4th Brigade, the 3rd Regiment of the 1st Garrison Brigade and the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Garrison Brigade. On January 17, 1947, the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade took the town of Yunyi (Êó¨ÈÇë), badly mauling the nationalist defenders in the process. The 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division was immediately dispatched to retake the town, but the communists had already abandoned the town and retreated with the captured supplies. Replenished with the newly captured supplies from the nationalists, the 3rd Regiment of the communist 1st Garrison Brigade and the communist Newly Organized 4th Brigade launched another round of assaults on nationalist positions aimed to neutralize the nationalist blockade line. On January 26, 1947, nationalist forts including Liangzhuang (Ê¢ÅÂ∫Ñ), Huangpu (ÈªÑÁî´), Baizitou (ÁôΩÂ≠êÂ§¥), Jinchi (ÈáëÊ±†), and Longao (ÈæôÈ´ò) fell into enemy hands and over 35 km of nationalist blockade line on the enemy were neutralized by their communist enemy. The nationalists planned a counterattack in order to restore the blockade. The 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 36th Division at Chunhua (Ê∑≥Âåñ) and the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division retook Yunyi (Êó¨ÈÇë) were order to attack the enemy in a pincer movement. On January 29, 1947, the 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 36th Division reached the region of Tongrun (ÈÄöÊ∂¶), while the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division reached the regions of Jinchi (ÈáëÊ±†), and Longao (ÈæôÈ´ò). The communists decided to concentrate their force to annihilate the 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 36th Division near the region of Liangzhuang (Ê¢ÅÂ∫Ñ), and the 7th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade was tasked to lure the intended nationalist victim into the trap from the region of Weijia (È≠èÂÆ∂). The 771st Regiment of the communist Newly Organized 4th Brigade was asked to outflank the intended nationalist victim and to seal off the escaping route of the nationalists. The 16th Regiment of the communist Newly Organized 4th Brigade would fight a blocking action at Huangpu (ÈªÑÁî´), and Yaoli (ËÖ∞Èáå) regions to prevent the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division from reinforcing the intended nationalist victim. On January 30, 1947, the nationalists renewed their attack on their communist enemy, but the advanced of the 143rd Regiment of the 48th Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 17th Division were checked by the enemy at Huangpu (ÈªÑÁî´), and Yaoli (ËÖ∞Èáå) regions just as the communists had planned. After successfully taking the region of Weijia (È≠èÂÆ∂) in a pincer movement, the 368th Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 36th Division continued their push toward the Liangzhuang (Ê¢ÅÂ∫Ñ). The 7th Regiment of the communist 3rd Garrison Brigade lured the 368 Regiment of the 123rd Brigade of the nationalist Reorganized 36th Division near Liangzhuang (Ê¢ÅÂ∫Ñ), with the 771st Regiment of the communist Newly Organized 4th Brigade outflanking the nationalist regiment, which was consequently besieged in the communist trap between the region of Ningjia (ÂÆÅÂÆ∂) and Liangzhuang (Ê¢ÅÂ∫Ñ). After a fierce battle, the besieged nationalist force was completely annihilated, suffering over 930 fatalities, and this nationalist defeat marked the end of the battle of Guanzhong. Although the communists had managed to score a victory over their nationalist adversaries and managed to keep their base in Guanzhong for the time being, it would not be long before they were forced to give it up once the nationalists were able to muster enough strength later on. The communists simply did not have the numbers necessary to defend the area. The nationalist defeat was only a temporary setback which caused the delay of their original plan to take the communist capital.

Grossman Joseph Grossman (10 October 1888 ‚Äì 18 January 1949) was a pioneer of the British film industry, most famous as the charismatic Studio Manager of Elstree Studios. Born in Dartford, Kent, the son of Myer Grossman and Rosa Morris, who belonged to Jewish families originally from Germany and Poland, he was always known as \\"Joe\\" and was famous for his nervous twitches and his Cockney humour. Joe Grossman was a contemporary of Oscar Deutsch and Michael Balcon, both of whom lived near his grandparents in Birmingham. He is mentioned in Michael Balcon's autobiography. Joe Grossman worked his whole life in the entertainment industry, first appearing on stage aged 4 in his father's theatre in Brentford, Middlesex. Joe and his identical twin brother, William, performed as a double-act and toured (as 'The Filberts') with magicians and illusionists Nevil Maskelyne and David Devant until the outbreak of war in 1914. (William is said to have died as an indirect result of copying Harry Houdini's famous illusion featuring an escape from a tank of water.) After serving with distinction in the Royal Army Medical Corps during The Great War, Joe Grossman entered the film industry in 1920, when Oswald Stoll gave him the post of Studio Manager at the Stoll Studios at Surbiton and, a year later, at the new Studios at Cricklewood. (Joe married Oswald Stoll's secretary, Esther Josephs, in 1922.) In 1927, John Maxwell, manager of British International Pictures (later Associated British Picture Corporation), offered him the Studio Manager job at Elstree, where he remained until his death. He worked with Alfred Hitchcock on his early films, including Blackmail, Britain's first talkie, and is credited as screenwriter with The Guns of Loos (1928) and The Lady From the Sea (1929). Joe Grossman was a Commander of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem and won many awards for meritorious service to the Order of St. John, the Fire Brigade (he was chief of the Elstree Fire Brigade) and Royal National Life Boat Service.

After witnessing the separate enemy offensives at regions including Northern Ticket (Beipiao, ÂåóÁ•®), Black Mountain (Heshan, ÈªëÂ±±), Greater Tiger Mountain, (Â§ßËôéÂ±±), Tai'an (Âè∞ÂÆâ) in late December, 1947, and learning that the communist 1st column and the 2nd column remained at Zhangwu in the second stage of the Winter Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China, Chen Cheng believed that the communist force was no longer concentrated together and thus he had an opportunity to launch a counterattack. The five nationalist armies deployed at Shenyang, Xinmin and Tieling were ordered to attack westward from Shenyang, hoping to relieve Faku (Ê≥ïÂ∫ì) by destroying the communist 1st column, 6th column, and the 10th column.

Not willing to risk losing any territory, Chen Cheng divided his force into half: have of the force would relieve the besieged southern front, while the remaining half would continue the push to Faku (Ê≥ïÂ∫ì). The communist resistance was much greater than nationalists had expected, resulting in neither half had the enough strength needed to complete their missions. On January 2, 1948, the nationalist Newly Organized 5th Army was stopped at the Princess Village (Gongzhutun, ÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ±Ø) by the communist 6th Column, and on the same day, communist 2nd Column, 3rd Column and 7th Column had also reached and encircled the nationalist army in at the Princess Village and surrounding regions including Yellow Family's Ridge, (Huangjialing, ÈªÑÂÆ∂Â≤≠), Xin Family's Hotel, (Xinjiadian, ËæõÂÆ∂Â∫ó), Anfu Village (Anfutun, ÂÆâÁ¶èÂ±Ø), and Chuanxin Hotel (Chuanxindian, Â∑ùÂøÉÂ∫ó). In the afternoon on January 5, 1948, the communist trap was completed and a full-scale assault on the besieged enemy was launched. The communist 3rd Column attacked from east and south, the communist 7th Column attacked from west and southwest, the communist 6th Column and 2nd Column attacked from north and northwest. After fierce battle, most of nationalist positions outside the Princess Village (Gongzhutun, ÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ±Ø) had lost, and by dawn of January 6, 1948, the survivors only held a 10 square kilometer region centered at Princess Village (Gongzhutun, ÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ±Ø). On January 5, 1948, the nationalist forces on the other two fronts attempted to reinforce their comrades-in-arms by their advances were checked by the communist 10th Column and 1st Column respectively at Liao River 20 km away. In the morning of January 6, 1948, the relentless assaults on the surviving nationalists at Princess Village (Gongzhutun, ÂÖ¨‰∏ªÂ±Ø) resumed under intense artillery shelling. The 7th Division of the communist 3rd Column concentrated over 50 artilleries to bombard Anfu Village (Anfutun, ÂÆâÁ¶èÂ±Ø), and annihilated the nationalist defenders from the 195th Division of the Newly Organized 5th Army. Immediately afterward, the communist 2nd Column and 7th Column besieged the 585th Regiment of the 195th Division of the nationalist Newly Organized 5th Army at Taoist Priest Wang's Village (Wangjiatun, ÁéãÈÅìÂ£´Â±Ø), and after numerous futile attempts to counterattack, the nationalist 585 Regiment was forced to surrender. The 584th Regiment and other units of the 195th Division of the nationalist Newly Organized 5th Army lost the willing to continue to wait for the reinforcement and attempted to break northeastward to the region of Rear Wen Family's Platform (Houwenjiatai, ÂêéÊñáÂÆ∂Âè∞), but they were completely annihilated in the knee-deep snow by the communist 2nd Column and 6th Column when they were bogged down. In the morning of January 7, 1948, the 5th Division of the communist 2nd Column and the 9th Division of the communist 3rd Column jointly launched the assault on the army headquarter of the nationalist Newly Reorganized 5th Army, and the divisional headquarter of the 43rd Division of the nationalist Newly Reorganized 5th Army, and another nationalist regiment at the region of Frontal Wen Family's Platform (Qianwenjiatai, ÂâçÊñáÂÆ∂Âè∞). Under the cover of intense artillery bombardment, the battle was over within an hour and the nationalist survivors were completely annihilated. In the evening of January 7, 1948, the communist 6th Column and two divisions of the communist 2nd Column jointly launched the assault on the two regiments of the 43rd Division of the nationalist Newly Reorganized 5th Army at the Yellow Family's Ridge, (Huangjialing, ÈªÑÂÆ∂Â≤≠), and the nationalist southern front was completely devastated, with the commander of the Newly Organized 5th Army and the commanders the 43rd division and the 195th division captured alive by the communists. Learning the news of the defeat of the southern front, the nationalist reinforcements to Faku (Ê≥ïÂ∫ì) and the southern front both withdrew back to Shenyang and Tieling, after suffering over 4,000 fatalities in their futile attempt to relief their besieged comrades-in-arms. During this campaign, the communists had succeeded in totally annihilating the nationalist Newly Organized 5th Army numbering more than 20,000, capturing the army commander and the nationalist divisional commanders of both the 195th Division and the 43rd Division. The communists also captured 261 artillery pieces, 6,880 guns, 137 motor vehicles, and 1,409 horses and mules. Gongzhutun Campaign was a decisive campaign in the Winter Offensive of 1947 in Northeast China in that it helped to determine the outcome of the offensive.

The campaign was part of the Huaihai campaign. Strategies After the Battle of Nianzhuang, in which the nationalist commander Huang Baitao's (:zh:ÈªÉÁôæÈüú) 7th Army was completely annihilated, the communists were divided on deciding the next target. After a heated debate, it was finally decided on November 22, 1948, that the next target should be the nationalist 12th Army commanded by Lieutenant General Huang Wei (:zh:ÈªÉÁ∂≠). A total of 7 columns (the equivalent of a corps) of the communist Central China Field Army (the equivalent of an army group) and 2 columns of the communist Eastern China Field Army would be tasked to annihilate the nationalist 12th Army in the region to the south of Kuai River(:zh:ÊæÆÊ≤≥), while the main force of the communist Eastern China Field Army would be tasked to prevent any nationalist troops in Xuzhou and Bangbu (:zh:ËöåÂü†) from reinforcing the nationalist 12th Army. The nationalists, on the other hand, had a much more solid objective of reestablishing the line of communication and transportation between Xuzhou and Bangbu by eradicating the communist forces in the region. To achieve this, the nationalists would launch a pincer movement from both south and north, with Lieutenant General Qiu Qingquan's (:zh:ÈÇ±Ê∏ÖÊ≥â) 2nd Army and General Sun Yuanliang's (:zh:Â≠´ÂÖÉËâØ) 16th Army in the north, and Lieutenant General Li Yannian's (:zh:ÊùéÂª∂Âπ¥) 6th Army and 12th Army in the south, with 12th Army attacking toward Xiu County(:zh:ÂÆøÁ∏£) from Mengcheng. Order of battle Nationalists * The 12th Army commanded by Huang Wei (:zh:ÈªÉÁ∂≠) 10th Corps 14th Corps 18th Corps 85th Corps Communists *Central China Field Army commanded by Liu Bocheng 1st Column 2nd Column 3rd Column 4th Column 6th Column 9th Column 11th Column *Eastern China Field Army commanded by Su Yu 3rd Column 7th Column 13th Column Artillery units *Independent Brigade of the Henan ‚Äì Anhui ‚Äì Jiangsu Military District *12th Brigade of the Southern Shaanxi Military District Initial deployment On November 23, 1948, the nationalist 12th Army began its attack on Nanping Village (Nanpingji, ÂçóÂù™ÈõÜ) on the southern bank of the Kuai River(ÊæÆÊ≤≥) by deploying the 10th Corps to the left, the 14th Corps to the right, the 18th Corps in the center and the 85th Corps behind the 18th Corps. The 4th Column of the communist Central China Field Army engaged the advancing nationalists, retreating gradually to lure the nationalists toward the communist trap by eventually abandoning Nanping Village in the evening of November 23, 1948. On the morning of November 24, 1948, the nationalist 12th Army crossed the Kuai River, and entered the trap the communists had set up in the regions of Dongpine Village (Dongpingji, Êù±Âù™ÈõÜ), Ren Family's Village (Renjiaji, ‰ªªÂÆ∂ÈõÜ), Seven Miles Bridge, (Qiliqiao, ‰∏ÉÈáåÊ©ã), Red Mouth (Zhukou, Êú±Âè£). Realizing that his forces were trapped, Huang Wei ordered his troops to retreat southward, planning to join another nationalist 6th Army commanded by Lieutenant General Li Yannian (:zh:ÊùéÂª∂Âπ¥) in Hu's Ditch Village (Hugouji, ËÉ°Ê∫ùÈõÜ) and Solid Town (Gujeng, Âõ∫ÈéÆ) by traveling along the southern shore of the Kuai River. Once the two nationalist armies, the 6th and the 12th, had joined together, they would travel northward along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. At dusk on November 24, 1948, the communists launched their full-scale attack in three fronts. In the western front, the 3rd Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from Sunding Village (Sundingji, Â≠´Áî∫ÈõÜ), the 1st Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from Five Ditch Village (Wugouji, ‰∫îÊ∫ùÈõÜ), the 2nd Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from White Sand Village (Baishaji, ÁôΩÊ≤ôÈõÜ), and the 6th Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from Cao's Market Village (Caoshiji, ÊõπÂ∏ÇÈõÜ). In the eastern front, the 11th Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from Jin County Village (Jinxianji, Èù≥Á∏£ÈõÜ). In the northern front, the 4th Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from the region of Wu Family's Lake (Wujiahu, ‰ºçÂÆ∂Êπñ), and the 9th Column of the communist Central China Field Army attacked from the region of Shao's House with Roof Tiles (Shaowafang, ÈÇµÁì¶Êàø). By the early morning of November 25, 1948, the nationalist 12th Army was surrounded in a 7.5 km wide region centered at Shuangdui Village (Shuangduiji, ÈõôÂ†ÜÈõÜ). Breakout attempt On November 26, 1948, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek gave permission to break out toward the southeast before the enemy's encirclement was fully completed. Huang Wei ordered four divisions ‚Äì the 11th Division and the 118th Division of the nationalist 18th Corps, the 18th Division of the nationalist 10th Corps and the 110th Division of the nationalist 85th Corps ‚Äì to attack the enemy position held by the communist 12th Brigade of the Southern Shaanxi Military District and the 6th Column of communist Central China Field Army. Despite support by tanks and air cover, the nationalists were repeatedly beaten back by the stubborn enemy resistance. The commander of the 110th Division of the nationalist 85th Corps, Major General Liao Yunzhou (ÂªñÈÅãÂë®), suggested to Huang Wei that four divisions going together would create too big a target that was obvious for the enemy to converge on. Since the enemy had not mustered enough forces to complete the encirclement and must deploy their force as a mobile strike force, it would be unlikely for the enemy to bother to stop smaller nationalist forces attempting to break out. Therefore, the breakout attempt should be led by a single division instead, so that the enemy would be fooled into believing such breakout was only attempted by a small unit as a decoy, and would not bother to waste their strength, saving their efforts to stop the perceived large-scale breakout attempt. Once the single division had slipped through the opening, other units would follow, and when the enemy had finally realized the consecutive attempts of smaller nationalist forces were the breakdown of a larger attempt, hopefully it would be probably too late and most of the nationalists would have succeeded in breaking out. Facing with previous setbacks, Huang Wei felt that Liao's suggestion appeared to be possible and granted this proposal, and Liao Yunzhou volunteered to lead his 110th Division of the nationalist 85th Corps as the vanguard of such attempt. However, unknown to Huang Wei, Liao Yunzhou was actually a secret member of the Chinese Communist Party, and led his 110th Division to defect to the communist side after the latter allowed his division to pass through safely. Witnessing what they believed to be a successful breakthrough, other nationalist divisions followed, but they were immediately ambushed by the waiting enemy and were forced to turn back. Redeployment After the failed attempt to break out, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek ordered Huang Wei to hold his position and wait for reinforcement. Huang Wei made the following new plans to consolidate his positions: the nationalist 18th Corps was deployed to guard the regions of Gudui (Ë∞∑Â†Ü) and Jiangu (Â∞ñË∞∑Â†Ü), the nationalist 85th Corps was deployed in the west to guard the region from Yaozhouwei (ËÖ∞Âë®Âúç) to Lizhuang (ÊùéËéä), the nationalist 14th Corps was deployed in the east to guard the regions of Zhanweizi (ÂºµÂúçÂ≠ê) and Yangsimazi (Ê•äÂõõÈ∫ªÂ≠ê), and the nationalist 10th Corps was deployed in the south to guard the region from Maweizi (È¶¨ÂúçÂ≠ê) to Yangzhuang (Ê•äËéä) and Lizhuang (ÊùéËéä). Huang's 12th Army headquarters was set up in Xiaomazhuang (Â∞èÈ¶¨Ëéä) to the north of Shuangduiji (ÈõôÂ†ÜÈõÜ). To counter the nationalist defense tactic that depended on bunkers and other fortifications, the communists adopted what they called the „Äåbunkers to bunkers and trenches to trenches„Äç tactic to breach the nationalist defense: the communists would build their own bunkers and trenches to protect themselves as they approached the nationalist positions and fight the defenders in close-quarter combat. By early December 1948, the nationalist defense sector was further shrunk, and with the exception of only seven or eight regiments that were still capable of fighting, all other nationalist units were only capable of static defense. End At 4:30 PM on December 6, 1948, the communist Central China Field Army launched its final assault on the besieged nationalists in three fronts: the eastern front consisted of the 4th Column, the 9th Column, and the 11th Column of communist Central China Field Army, augmented by most of the artillery units of communist Eastern China Field Army and the Independent Brigade of the communist Henan ‚Äì Anhui ‚Äì Jiangsu Military District. The western front consisted of the 1st Column and the 3rd Column of the communist Central China Field Army, augmented by the 13th Column and the remaining artillery units of communist Eastern China Field Army. The southern front consisted of the 6th Column of communist Central China Field Army, augmented by the 7th Column communist Eastern China Field Army and the 12th Brigade of communist Southern Shaanxi Military District. The fighting was extremely brutal and bloody, and the communists were able to gradually gain more ground. By December 13, 1948, nationalist forces under the command of Huang Wei held a small area of 1.5 km across. Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi issued an ultimatum to Huang Wei, demanding his immediate surrender, but Huang Wei refused and organized the last but futile attempt to break out. The nationalists put up a gallant fight which was not expected by their enemy, and as a result, the communists had to reinforce their southern front by deploying additional troops of the 3rd Column and 13th Column of the communist Eastern China Field Army. However, the end was inevitable and luck was not on the nationalist side: as Huang Wei attempted to break out, his tank broke down and he was captured alive, and his 12th Army was totally annihilated by dusk on December 15, 1948. Only his deputy commander Hu Lien was able to break out with eight thousand soldiers and escape back to Nanjing. Outcome The communist victory of the Shuangduiji campaign (ÈõôÂ†ÜÈõÜÊà∞ÂΩπ) further ensured their victory in the Huaihai campaign, and the victory at Shuangdui Village (Shuangduiji, ÈõôÂ†ÜÈõÜ) resulted in killing more than 46,000 nationalists and capturing over 50,000, including Huang Wei, the commanding general officer of the nationalist 12th Army. A huge quantity of hardware was also captured by the communists, including 870 pieces of artillery, 15 tanks, and over 300 motor vehicles, and large amounts of munitions, all of which were immediately used against their former nationalist owners. The communists suffered 36,000 casualties, with the 4th Column of the Central China Field Army suffering the most casualties: 6,827 wounded and 1,853 killed. This campaign was very significant for the Chinese communists, particularly the communist Central China Field Army which faced absolute technical inferiority due to the lack of artillery and other heavy weapons. The communist victory in the Shuangduiji campaign not only annihilated a significant portion of nationalist troops deployed in the Huaihai campaign, thus ensuring final victory, but also provided the communist Central China Field Army with much needed heavy weapons.

The campaign was part of Guangxi Campaign. Order of battle * Nationalists:  III Corps * 7th Army * 48th Army * 126th Army * Communists:  43rd Army  14th Army  15th Army After the nationalist offensive in the southern front had been defeated by the advance communist, Bai Chongxi ordered the nationalist III Corps and XI Corps to immediately retreat. The communist forces at the southern front consisted of units of the communist II Field Army and Fourth Field Army begun the pursuit on November 27, 1949. To boost morale, the nationalist commander-in-chief Zhang Gan (Âº†Ê∑¶) decided to be the last to retreat and his III Corps headquarters remained behind in the town of Bobai (ÂçöÁôΩ), but this was detected by the attack communists in the afternoon of December 30, 1949. Two regiments of the communist 43rd Army was immediately dispatched to attack the town and reached the town by 8:00 PM on the same day. After breaching the defense of the town at the northern and eastern gates, the attacking communists managed to besiege the surviving nationalists at their corps headquarters located in the library building. After fierce street fights, the battle ended on 10:30 PM on December 30, 1949 with communist victory, and Zhang Gan (Âº†Ê∑¶), the nationalist commander-in-chief of the III Corps was captured alive with most of his staff. Meantime, the forces of the communist IV Corps from regions of Hua (Âåñ) county, and Zhangjiang (Êº≥Ê±ü) had badly mauled the 48th Army of the nationalist III Corps and then also approached the town of Bobai (ÂçöÁôΩ). While the communists were attacking the besieged the town of Bobai (ÂçöÁôΩ), the nationalist commander-in-chief Zhang Gan (Âº†Ê∑¶) ordered the 7th Army, 48th Army and 126th Army of the III Corps to counterattack toward the town. In the early morning of December 1, 1949, the three nationalist armies had approached the town of Bobai (ÂçöÁôΩ), but as the nationalists learned that their corps headquarters had been annihilated and their commander-in-chief was captured alive by the enemy, the nationalist morale collapsed. Taking the advantage of the situation, the communist 43rd Army, 14th Army and 15th Army immediately launched an offensive against the three nationalist armies, and by 3:00 pm, the campaign concluded with the most of nationalists killed or captured. The communist victory of Bobai Campaign (ÂçöÁôΩÊàòÂΩπ) resulted in the near total annihilation of the nationalist III Corps, with the exception of a portion of nationalist 126th Army successfully retreating westward. The loss of the nationalist III Corps resulted in the further weakening of the nationalist defense in Guangxi while the communist victory of Guangxi Campaign was further guaranteed.

Order of battle: *Nationalists: Temporarily Organized 1st Army (4,000+) *Communists: 141st Division of the communist 47th Army (7000+) Bamianshan (ÂÖ´Èù¢Â±±), meaning Eight Sided Mountain literally, is located 10 km to the north of the town of Liye (ÈáåËÄ∂) in the border region of Hunan, Sichuan and Hubei. The difficult terrain made it ideal as a hideout for bandits, who had plagued the local region for more than a century. By the end of 1949 the bandits were led by Shi Xingzhou (Â∏àÂÖ¥Âë®). In late December 1949 the Nationalist Temporarily Organized 1st Army led by its commander Chen Zixian (ÈôàÂ≠êË¥§) withdrew to the mountains and convinced the local bandits to join them, fighting the communists together. The Nationalists planned to use the mountain as a guerilla base to launch operations against their Communist enemy. In mid- January 1950 the 141st Division of the communist 47th Army was tasked with the extermination of the Nationalist guerrillas and the division began its intensive training in mountain warfare. Two regiments of the 141st Division of the 47th Army were deployed in the regions of Neixipeng (ÂÜÖÂ§ïÊ£ö), Greater Rocky Gate (Dayanmen, Â∞èÂ≤©Èó®) and Lesser Rocky Gate (Xiaoyanmen, Â∞èÂ≤©Èó®), thus completing the encirclement of the Eight Sided Mountain (Bamianshan, ÂÖ´Èù¢Â±±). The battle erupted on January 19, 1950, when a detachment of Communist troops secretly climbed up the southern cliff of the mountain and dispersed the Nationalist guerrillas in a surprise attack. The defenders were overwhelmed by the rapid and decisive surprise attack and were completely demoralized; they abandoned their posts and began to flee. The commanders were unable to rally their troops for an effective counterattack and the guerrilla headquarters located in the Swallow Cave (Yanzidong, ÁáïÂ≠êÊ¥û) fell, with a huge amount of weapons captured by the attacking enemy. After the main engagement the Communists began to eradicate the surviving Nationalist guerrillas by fighting in small teams, and by the end of January 1950 the battle concluded with over 3,000 Nationalist guerrillas killed or captured. The Nationalist plan of long-term guerrilla and insurgency warfare had been crushed. The Communist victory, however, was incomplete: around 1,000 Nationalist guerrilla fighters successfully escaped to fight for another day at different locations, including their commander Chen Zixian (ÈôàÂ≠êË¥§). Most of the escaped Nationalist guerrillas retreated to Sichuan.

She was responsible for delivering and disbursing goods and equipment to locations in the war zone. Castor (AKS-1) was launched as SS Challenger on 20 May 1939 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Kearny, New Jersey, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. T. M. Woodward; acquired by the Navy 23 October 1940 and renamed Castor six days later; and commissioned 12 March 1941, Commander F. Johnson in command.  World War II Pacific Theatre operations  Clearing Norfolk, Virginia, 6 May 1941, Castor arrived at San Diego, California, 20 May to begin a series of cargo voyages to Pearl Harbor. In October, she carried U.S. Marine reinforcements to Johnston Island and Wake Island. = Strafed at Pearl Harbor = Returning to San Francisco, California, to load explosives, Castor arrived in Pearl Harbor three days before the Japanese attack of 7 December 1941. Her guns were quickly brought into action, and while she was repeatedly strafed by enemy planes, she suffered little damage and no casualties in the attack.http://www.history.navy.mil/docs/wwii/pearl/ph31.htm USS Castor, Report of Pearl Harbor Attack = Transporting emergency material after start of war = Until 7 February 1942, Castor carried cargo from the U.S. West Coast to aid in the buildup of Pearl Harbor as the nerve center for the Pacific Ocean, then aided in the opening of operations in the critical South Pacific area with cargo runs from San Francisco to bases in New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Fiji Islands, and New Zealand. A cargo voyage to Funafuti and Espiritu Santo in November and December 1943 found her carrying essential supplies for the Gilbert Islands invasion. = Invasion forces support = From January 1944, her voyages from the west coast were to bases in the Marshall Islands, and after a brief overhaul at Seattle, Washington, Castor reported at Manus 18 September for duty with famed task force TF 58. Operating primarily from Manus and Ulithi, she replenished the fast carrier task force at sea thus helping to expedite the smashing series of raids which pushed the Japanese ever westward. The final phase of these operations found the cargo ship acting in support of the assault on Okinawa, off which she operated through May and June 1945. Unscathed by the inferno which kamikaze attacks made of duty off Okinawa, Castor sailed for overhaul at San Francisco on 10 July. = End-of-war activity = Between December 1945 and February 1947, Castor supplied occupation forces in the Far East, calling at Guam, Saipan, Tsingtao, Hong Kong, and Japanese ports. She was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Francisco 30 June 1947.  Reactivated during Korean War  With the outbreak of war in Korea, Castor was recommissioned 24 November 1950, and cleared San Francisco 11 March 1951 for training at Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Sasebo 14 May and from this base supplied ships in the harbors of Inchon and Pusan, Korea, as well as replenishing ships of task force TF 77 at sea. = Dead in the water during a bad storm = Leaving Yokosuka astern 18 March 1952, Castor ran into a fierce storm which damaged her engines and left her dead in the water for 22 hours until she could be towed back to Japan for emergency repairs. She arrived at San Francisco 25 April for overhaul and permanent repairs. = Home port at Yokosuka = On 9 September 1952, Castor returned to Yokosuka, now to be her home port. Since that date and through 1962 she has operated from Yokosuka and occasionally from Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, supporting the ever more important operations of U.S. 7th Fleet, as it carries out its assignment to keep the Taiwan Patrol Force at sea, and in September 1954 took part in the Vietnamese evacuation, Operation Passage to Freedom, off Indo-China. An overhaul at San Francisco early in 1955 fitted her to carry both technical and general stores.  Rescuing typhoon survivors  While bound for Subic Bay on 19 October 1956, Castor fought her way unscathed through a furious typhoon, and next day received a distress message from the Philippine merchantman SS Lepus. With the aid of search planes, Castor located and rescued 11 survivors of the stricken ship. This rescue won a citation and plaque for Castor from Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay.  Vietnam War operations  Castor was homeported in Sasebo, Japan during the mid sixties. She made runs to Vietnam, picking up stores in Sasebo, Subic Bay, Philippines and Kaoshung, Taiwan. She and and Castor's sister ship which was home ported in Yokosuka, Japan were the only commissioned U.S. Naval supply ships serving the Vietnam units until Castors decommissioning. Pollux was also decommissioned during the Vietnam War (1968).  Military awards and honors  Castor received three battle stars for World War II service: * Pearl Harbor * Gilbert Islands operation * Okinawa Gunto operation She received two for Korean War service: * Communist China Spring Offensive * UN Summer-Fall Offensive During the Vietnam War she earned the following campaign stars: * Vietnam Defense * Vietnamese Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase II * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase III * Tet Counteroffensive * Vietnamese Counteroffensive - Phase IV Her crew was eligible for the following medals and campaign ribbons: * Combat Action Ribbon (retroactive) * China Service Medal (extended) * American Defense Campaign Medal * American Campaign Medal * Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (3) * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp) * National Defense Service Medal (2) * Korean Service Medal (2) * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2 Taiwan Straits, 32 Quemoy-Matsu, 11 Vietnam) * Vietnam Service Medal (6) * United Nations Service Medal * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal * Republic of Korea War Service Medal (retroactive)  References   External links  * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AKS-1 Castor Type C2 ships Ships built in Kearny, New Jersey 1939 ships Merchant ships of the United States Castor-class general stores issue ships Type C2 ships of the United States Navy World War II auxiliary ships of the United States ","title":"USS Castor (AKS-1)"},{"id":"12879282","text":"Harry Wayne Comer (born February 3, 1944) is a former Major League Baseball outfielder.

While Temple Shalom is an affiliate of the Union for Reform Judaism, as the only Jewish congregation in Fayetteville, Temple Shalom supports a variety of activities and services for Jews of all backgrounds. Breaking ground for the new building Temple Shalom Religious School Early history On January 21, 1981 about 30 people attended a meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas with Rabbi Lawrence Jackofsky of the Southwest Council, Union of American Hebrew Congregations of Dallas. An overwhelming majority of those present favored the establishment of a Jewish congregation. On February 23, 1981 the congregation was formed and named Temple Shalom.ISJL : Digital Archive: Fayetteville, Arkansas In March 1981, Rabbi Norbert L. Rosenthal, emeritus rabbi of Temple Israel in Tulsa, Oklahoma was invited to serve as the first rabbi. At the consecration ceremony on April 25, 1981, the new board officers were installed. Temple Shalom arranged to use the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship hall for monthly services. Weekly Religious School, organized and conducted by parent volunteers took place at the Sam Barg Hillel House at 607 Storer. Lay leaders conducted weekly Friday night services. Building history In 1999, the University of Arkansas Hillel began leasing a building from the University at 608 N. Storer Avenue in Fayetteville. Temple Shalom leased space in this larger building. Larger gatherings continued to take place at the neighboring Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. Religious School was held every Sunday morning. In 2004, when Temple Shalom was growing out of that building, some members from the Rogers and Bentonville area decided to form a new congregation in Bentonville, Congregation Etz Chaim,Congregation Etz Chaim - Building a Jewish Community in Northwest Arkansas temporarily easing the need for Temple Shalom to move again to a bigger facility. By 2005, Temple Shalom had again grown enough to need its own building. The membership included nearly 60 families. There were about 30 children attending Religious School, several of whom became Bar and Bat Mitzvah each year. The project to acquire a building for Fayetteville's first synagogue was launched headed by the synagogue's president. Certain members proposed donating seed money for the project. The temple briefly considered buying and renovating an E. Fay Jones house, but those plans fell through. In 2006, local builder, Fadil Bayyari, a Palestinian Muslim from Springdale, Arkansas proposed to build a new building for Temple Shalom at his cost, a savings of an estimated 20% of the total cost of the project. Mr. Bayyari's offer spurred much interest in the local and national press.In Brief - washingtonpost.comNWAnews.com :: Northwest Arkansas' News Source Here and Now : Building Synagogue Builds Bridges - 16 October 2007Boston Jew and West Bank Muslim Build a Temple, and Bridges, in Arkansas - New York Times In 2007 Temple Shalom purchased a little less than an acre of land at the corner of Sang Avenue and Cleveland Street to create a combined Temple Shalom and University of Arkansas Hillel home and to house a multicultural library.

History The presence of Greeks and Phoenicians presuppose the Roman occupation in the territory, but it was in 1166 that the first reference Angeja appeared, in the form of ANSEGIA. Angeja obtained a foral from King D. Manuel I on 15 August 1514, that included the lands of Assequins, Bemposta, Branca, Canelas, Casais de Grij√≥, Casais do Ribeiro, Contumil, Devesa, Fermel√£, Figueiredo, Fonte Ch√£, Pinheiro, Salreu and Santi√£es. Initially, this territory was part of the Terras de Santa Maria (Lands of Santa Maria), commonly known as Terras da Feira (Lands of the Fair), which were incorporated into coat-of-arms. By 1853 Angeja was the municipal seat, but this lasted until the end of the year, when the municipality became extinct and integrated into the much larger municipality of Albergaria-a- Velha. The old town of Angeja and parish of Nossa Senhora das Neves was a curia of the vicarage of S√£o Miguel de Fermel√£, later rectory and priory. The marquesses of Angeja, who never lived in the parish, had a procurator that received the land rents. During the Napoleonic Wars the French razed many of the homes in the parish, which were followed by national revolts during the Restoration and Liberal Wars. During the Liberal Constitution, the reorganization of the civil government and administration had resulted in annexation of several other parishes: Canelas, Fermel√£ and Frossos. In 1849 its population had surpassed 5124 inhabitants After this period of political instability, the small parish was elevated to the status of municipality in 1853, before its administrative charter was extinguish and re-integrated (along with Frossos) into the municipality of Albergaria-a-Velha. On 20 June 1991, following pressure from the local population and a petition motivated in the Assembly of the Republic, Angeja was elevated to the status of vila (comparable to a town). Geography Located from the municipal seat, Angeja is also from the district capital, Aveiro. It is bounded in the north by the parish of Fermel√¢, the municipalities of Estarreja and Murtosa, to the west by the parish of Cacia in the municipality of Aveiro, the east by the parish of Albergaria-a-Velha, and to the south the parish of Frossos. The narrow administrative boundary crosses diagonally from northwest to southeast on the eastern border of Albergaria-a-Velha, following portions of the Vouga River (southwest) and Aveiro River (northwest). The communities of Angeja and Font√£o occupy the southeast corner of the parish, with smaller settlement of Font√£o nestled within a river valley closer to the parish border with Albergaria-a- Velha. Economy The parish follows the Vouga River valley, its residents concentrated along the margins and occupied with agriculture. The waters of the Vouga also allows the existence of an active fishing industry, especially after industrial effluentes were redirected, that includes species of threadfin, carp, eel, ray-fins and lampreys.

Her arms, with those of her husband, Duke Arnold of Guelders, are in the bottom center; the arms of her ancestors are in each corner. Another page The Hours of Catherine of Cleves (Morgan Library and Museum, now divided in two parts, M. 917 and M. 945, the latter sometimes called the Guennol Hours or, less commonly, the Arenberg Hours) is an ornately illuminated manuscript in the Gothic art style, produced in about 1440 by the anonymous Dutch artist known as the Master of Catherine of Cleves. It is one of the most lavishly illuminated manuscripts to survive from the 15th century and has been described as one of the masterpieces of Northern European illumination.Plummer, John. The Hours of Catherine of Cleves. New York, George Braziller, 1966. Rouse, Richard. Book Review of The Book of Hours of Catherine of Cleves by John Plummer. Speculum, v. 40, n. 3, 1965. (538-540). This book of hours contains the usual offices, prayers and litanies in Latin, along with supplemental texts, decorated with 157 colorful and gilded illuminations. Today, both parts of the manuscript that forms this book are housed at the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City.Morgan History =Origin= The Hours of Catherine of Cleves (The Hours) was commissioned for Catherine, Duchess of Guelders and Countess of Zutphen, upon the occasion of her marriage to Arnold, Duke of Guelders, on 26 January 1430. Dr. John Plummer, Curator of Medieval Manuscripts at the Morgan Library, suggested that this Horae was commissioned for the wedding in 1430, but it required time to complete. The Hours was produced in Utrecht and not completed until after 1434, probably around 1440. The earlier date is based on the picture of a coin, minted in 1434 by Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, shown in the border of M. 917, p. 240; Plummer, Plate 117. Wieck, Roger S. Painted Prayers: the Book of Hours in Medieval and Renaissance Art. NY: George Braziller, 1997. Patrons The Hours was commissioned for Catherine of Cleves by either her fatherPlummer, John.

Since the 11th century, the town of Cleves had been the home of the venerable and wealthy Counts of Cleves. The Counts were elevated to a ducal house in 1417, the year Catherine was born. The Cleves family seat is the Schwanenburg, the Swan Castle, with its massive square tower, the Schwanenturm, the Tower of the Knights of the Swan, which is immortalized in Richard Wagner's opera, Lohengrin. The first two full page miniatures celebrate her illustrious lineage. The first page shows Catherine of Cleves kneeling before the Virgin and the Christ Child, who take a personal interest in her salvation. Catherine is identified by her arms, in the center bottom, shown with those of her husband, Duke Arnold of Guelders. The borders of both pages are decorated with an heraldic display of the Arms of her eight great-great grandfathers: :::Count Diderik of Cleves, :::Count Engelbert of Mark, :::Duke Ludwig of Bavaria, :::Duke Ludwig of Liegnitz, :::King Jean the Good of France, :::Duke Lodewijk of Flanders, :::Duke Wilhelm of J√ºlich, and :::Duke Otto of Ravensberg.Morgan Catherine of Cleves is shown kneeling before The Virgin and the Christ Child, M. 945, folio 1 verso; Plummer, Plate 1. She is shown giving alms in Piety, the sixth gift of the Holy Spirit, M. 917, p. 65; Plummer, Plate 57. Catherine is also shown kneeling, with the Virgin, before Christ, in The Crucifixion, M. 917, p. 160; Plummer, Plate 96. Her husband, Arnold, Duke of Guelders, may be the lord shown kneeling before Christ in Fear of the Lord, the seventh gift of the Holy Spirit, M. 917, p. 58; Plummer, Plate 58. In the reconstructed book, his portrait follows that of Catherine‚Äôs in Piety. And, some of his coinage is shown in the border of M. 917, p. 240; Plummer, Plate 117. Artist The Master of Catherine of Cleves was the anonymous illuminator, who is named after this masterpiece of Netherlandish illumination. The Cleves Master might have been a member of the van Aken family of painters. A study of the miniatures indicates that the Cleves Master designed and painted over 157 miniatures, as well as the principal border decorations, with minimal assistance from two workshop assistants.Walther, Ingo F. and Norbert Wolf. Codices Illustres: The world's most famous illuminated manuscripts, 400 to 1600. K√∂ln, TASCHEN, 2005. Hours of Catherine of Cleves. The Hours have several anomalies. Hell was usually not depicted in Books of Hours, though normal in the Last Judgements in churches, because the sight was thought unwelcome to the often female patrons. The Master‚Äôs Mouth of Hell at the beginning of the Office of the Dead actually shows three animal mouths: an uppermost stone-like portal, framed by souls boiling in pots, screams in agony; a lower mouth grimaces, its lips drawn apart by demons; and within that lower mouth, a fire-red creature opens its own jaws.Morgan image The surrounding tableau of demons tormenting the souls of the dead was painted nearly 50 yrs before Hieronymus Bosch painted his. Marginal genre scenes clearly relate to the religious scenes in the main miniatures above. Details of the book, such as traps and nets in borders, relate very closely to details in the Merode Altarpiece by Robert Campin (or a follower), and suggest strongly that the master knew works by Campin.JSTOR, Art Bulletin reprinted in: Meyer Schapiro, Selected Papers, volume 3, Late Antique, Early Christian and Mediaeval Art, 1980, Chatto & Windus, London, , and: Lane, Barbara G,The Altar and the Altarpiece, Sacramental Themes in Early Netherlandish Painting, pp. 42‚Äì47 Stories flow through successive pictures: a woman watches a man die, weeps, then goes on a pilgrimage; souls within Hell dine upon the Host, and are rescued by an angel. There is little repetition, and the miniatures form a harmonious whole. Antithesis and unusual iconography conveys irony and humor. Saint James the Less was known for his abstinence, so the border depicts men drinking wine. Saint Gregory, the great Church administrator, is shown with a border of gold and silver coins. Saint Peter is painted with the key of the Church, standing above a triskelion (a reference to the Trinity) of fresh fish as the fisher of men. Saint Lawrence is shown with the grill of his martyrdom, and the alms purse attribute as the patron of the poor. His border shows fresh fish ready for grilling, and the big fish eating the little fish, representing the rich devouring the poor, a common literary and pictorial theme of the 15th and 16th centuries. These fantastic trompe l‚Äôoeil borders were to influence the work of the Master of Mary of Burgundy 30 years later. The Cleves Master was a superb realist who showed scenes of 15th-century Utrecht, especially in the small bas-de-page pictures. The Holy Family at dinner shows Saint Joseph wearing clogs and spooning gruel, while reclining in a barrel chair in front of a lively fire.Image The Virgin is seated on the other side of the fire, suckling Jesus in her neat, orderly kitchen. By reconstructing The Hours from the two principal manuscripts, one can see the Master grow as an artist over the several years it took to illuminate The Hours. The early miniatures and iconography are comparable to the contemporary panel paintings of Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck, and share many close similarities. The later miniatures are painted with the imagination, originality, and vibrant colors that characterize Early Netherlandish painting and the later developments of that tradition. This originality of technique and awareness of everyday life prompted Delaiss√© to call the Cleves Master \\"the ancestor of the 17th century Dutch school of painting.\\" =Modern period= After disappearing from view for some 400 years, the Hours of Catherine of Cleves surfaced in 1856. Jacques Joseph Techener, a Parisian book dealer, offered The Hours for sale at 15,000 francs. At some time before 1896, Prince Charles d‚ÄôArenberg purchased The Hours (M 945); or rather, he bought half of The Hours. In 1963, Frederick Adams was offered another Cleves Master Horae (M 917) by an unnamed European owner. A comparison of this discovered book with the Guennol Hours (M 945) revealed that not only were they by the same artist, and from the same workshop, but both Horae were incomplete and complemented each other. This observation suggested that they were once a single volume, which had been deliberately disassembled into two separate liturgical books. Scholars believe that sometime in the 1850s, The Hours was separated into two volumes, and several leaves were removed. Microscopic examination revealed that some of the rubrics had been deliberately erased, so the leaves could be reassembled without a tell-tale break in the text. The two volumes have been recovered; but, the 9-12 missing leaves are presumed lost. In 1970, the Guennol Hours (M.945) was purchased by the Pierpont Morgan Library through the Belle da Costa Greene Foundation, with additional assistance of various Library Fellows. By studying the text, the iconography, and the physical makeup of the two volumes, Dr John Plummer, Morgan Library Curator of Medieval Manuscripts, reconstructed the original sequence of the original, single volume of the Hours of Catherine of Cleves. In connection with a 2010 exhibition entitled ‚ÄúDemons and Devotion: The Hours of Catherine of Cleves,‚Äù the Morgan Library disbound the two volumes to display 93 of the illuminations in their original order. After the show which ends on May 2, 2010, the library will rebind the book with the leaves in their proper order.Roberta Smith, Miniature Visions of Life, Faith and Purgatory‚Äôs Gaping Maw, New York Times, Jan. 21, 2010 Provenance :::Catherine, Duchess of Guelders, for whom it was made, 1440‚Äì1445 (single volume) :::Ermengard of Lochhorst, who allegedly received it from Catherine :::Disappeared for 400 years :::Jacques Techener, Parisian Book dealer, 1856 (divided into 2 volumes: M 945, M 917; and missing leaves) ::M 917 :::Baron Maurice de Rothschild, 1936 (M 917) :::Frederick Adams, Bookseller, discovers another Cleves Master Horae, 1963 (M 917) :::Morgan Library and Museum, purchased 1963 (M 917) ::M945 :::Prince Charles d‚ÄôArenberg, purchased before 1896 (M 945) :::Duchess Julie d‚ÄôArenberg (M 945) :::Duke Engelbert d‚ÄôArenberg (M 945) :::Duke Engelbert-Marie d‚ÄôArenberg exhibited as the Arenberg Hours in D√ºsseldorf, 1904 (M 945) :::Hans P.

Saint Quirinus, Saint Margaret and two other saints are missing; at least five to eight other leaves are missing, too. The text is Latin in a Gothic script with black and red ink, by a single scribe; there are catchwords and rubricator‚Äôs notes in other hands. =Contents= Books of hours were extremely popular in the late medieval times, and by the date of these hours the most common vehicle for lavish illumination. The books were intended for regular use, by lay people, who wished to structure their devotional life. Observing the canonical hours centered upon the recitation, or singing, of a number of psalms, which are accompanied by prayers, specified by the eight hours of the liturgical day. The core text of a Book of Hours is the Little Office of the Virgin, illustrated by scenes from the Life of the Virgin. This series of hourly prayers were prayed to the Mother of God, who co-mediates and sanctifies the prayers to God. The Penitential Psalms were recited to help one resist temptation of committing any of the Seven Deadly Sins. The prayers in the Office of the Dead were prayed to shorten the time a loved one spent in Purgatory. Supplementary texts were added to celebrate any personal patron, family saint, special circumstances, or a fortuitous event. This standard pattern of daily prayer provided the framework for the artists' efforts.Froehlich, Karlfried, Princeton Theological Seminary link This book contains: :::A Calendar of feast days, :::The Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, :::The Hours of the Cross, :::The Hours of Eternal Wisdom, :::The Office for the Dead, :::The Seven Penitential Psalms, :::Various Litanies and Prayers, :::A series of seven Offices for each day, with an accompanying Mass; and :::The Suffrages, a Memorial of the Saints. =Decoration= Saint Laurence with a border of fishes. These volumes come from a period when luxury books of hours for the wealthy were produced for their artistic and decorative effect. The artist chose an unusually wide variety of subject matter for his border illuminations. He decorated his borders with beautiful trompe l‚Äôoeil depictions of nature: mussels, fruit, birds, fish, and more.Seafood border The Master also depicts man-made beauty, such as jewelry, tiles, coins, and furniture. These border decorations would greatly influence the Master of Mary of Burgundy. The Cleves Master was familiar with the details of humble tasks such as milking a cow, selling wine, and baking bread. In spite of the humble occupations depicted in the miniatures and borders, the luxurious details of wealth and elegance dominate the miniatures, to emphasize that this book was made for an aristocratic client. Ingenious theological links between the subjects of the main images and the objects in the borders have been suggested by some scholars, though many of these are not generally accepted. The Cleves Master's originality is in the trompe l'oeil effects, and in the still life borders. For example, a border of pretzels and wafers encircles Saint Bartholomew, mussels enclose Saint Ambrose, and a rosary frames the Adoration of the Magi. Meiss observed that these pages are constructed so that the reader views the border through a magnifying glass and the miniature through a telescope. The Hours uses framing as a means to encourage viewers to think of themselves as participants with God in creating sacred time.Williams, Rita. Patterns in the Framing: Patience and The Hours of Catherine of Cleves http://www.publications.villanova.edu/Concept/2005/Patterns.pdf The human figure appears flexible and articulate. The Master handles distance by graduated scale and diminishing clarity. The artist's increasing skill in depicting these realistic features can be traced from the start to the finish of this book. As a whole, the Cleves Master‚Äôs decorations concentrate on the great themes of late medieval theology and piety: the Trinity, Christ, the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints, death, salvation, and eternal life. The standard pattern of these devotional prayers provided the framework for the Cleves Master‚Äôs efforts. The challenge to the artists of his day was to apply their utmost skill in devising sumptuous pictures, which were fresh and delightful, but fully compliant with religious conventions and the expectations of their noble clients. =Reproductions= In 1964, the Morgan Library produced an 83-page catalogue, The Book of Hours of Catherine of Cleves, for the Cleves Hours exhibit held at the Library. Both the cloth and paperback editions contained 30 black and white plates, plus 2 color plates, accompanied with commentaries by Dr. John Plummer, Curator of Mediaeval Manuscripts at the Pierpont Morgan Library. Frederick B. Adams, Jr, wrote the Foreword, which incorporated comments by Harry Bober, L. M. J. Delaiss√©, Millard Meiss, and Erwin Panofsky. In 1966, the publisher, George Braziller, produced a full color, partial facsimile. All 157 of the miniatures were reproduced in color with gold. Three text pages of prayers were reproduced in color. The 160 facsimile pages were accompanied with notes and commentaries by Dr. John Plummer. This book was issued as a 359-page leather, or leatherette, hardback volume in a slipcase. A cloth hardback edition was issued in 1975. And, in 1980, the publisher, George Braziller, produced a paperback facsimile of this book. In 2002, George Braziller published a third edition as a 360-page hardback. All 157 of the miniatures and three text pages were reproduced in color with gold. Dr. Plummer includes a new foreword, along with the 1966 edition Introduction and commentaries, accompanying each facsimile page. In conjunction with a 2010 exhibition of the manuscript,Morgan Library exhibition the Morgan Library prepared a complete digital facsimile of the miniatures and any facing text pages.Digital facsimile of the manuscript Use The Hours of the Virgin are those for use of the Augustinian canons of the Windesheim chapter. The Office of the Dead is also that for Windesheim use, which is the same as for Utrecht. The Hours of Catherine of Cleves is still relevant today as a devotional text. Karlfried Froehlich, Princeton Theological Seminary, makes a statement about the modern usage of books of hours: > In their imaginative use of traditional iconography the artists put us in > touch with a wealth of theological tradition that had developed over > centuries and had marked with its symbols the meditative road into the depth > dimension. Behind the pictures in these volumes we meet not only the > theology of an individual Christian but also a theology expressive of the > collective witness of many generations who drew their strength from the > contemplation of the realities to which their symbols pointed. There is > nothing that could prevent a miniature from the Hours of Catherine of Cleves > from becoming an effective help of Christian meditation today.

It had formerly been placed in the family Grammitidaceae, but this family is no longer recognized by most authors because phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have shown that it is embedded in Polypodiaceae.Harald Schneider, Hans-Peter Krier, Rosemary Wilson, and Alan R.

The delimitation of Grammitis was drastically narrowed in the first decade of the 21st century. It now contains about 25 species. In 2003, a study of the distribution of grammitid ferns placed 11 species in the New World, 7 in Africa, and 4 in the Pacific.Barbara S. Parris. 2003. \\"The distribution of Grammitidaceae (Filicales) inside and outside Malesia\\". Telopea 10(2):451-466.

CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names volume II. CRC Press: Boca Raton; New York; Washington,DC;, USA. London, UK. (vol II). (see External links below). The type species for Grammitis is Grammitis marginella. The only known fossil of a grammitid fern has been named Grammitis succinea, but it is not clear that it belongs to Grammitis as more recently defined. It was found in Oligocene amber from the Dominican Republic.David J. Mabberley. 2008. Mabberley's Plant-Book third edition (2008). Cambridge University Press: UK. Circumscription In a treatment of Grammitidaceae in 1990, Barbara S. Parris defined Grammitis broadly, to include about 400 species.Barbara S. Parris. 1990. \\"Grammitidaceae\\" pages 153-157. In: Klaus Kubitzki (general editor); Karl U. Kramer and Peter S. Green (volume editors) The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants volume I. Springer-Verlag: Berlin;Heidelberg, Germany. At that time, she stated that \\"The treatment of Grammitis here as a large and diverse genus reflects our current lack of knowledge concerning relationships within the family\\". Other authors at that time circumscribed Grammitis more narrowly, to include about 200 species. Since about 2003, Grammitis has been understood as a genus of about 25 species with the other species to be eventually transferred to other genera, most of them new or resurrected. Grammitis sensu strictissimo (about 25 species) is distinguished by its black, sclerified leaf margins.Tom A. Ranker. 2008. \\"A New Combination in Adenophorus (Polypodiaceae)\\". American Fern Journal 98(3):170-177. It is sister to the monophyletic genus Cochlidium. In 2004, Grammitis was shown to be polyphyletic if broadly circumscribed.Tom A. Ranker, Alan R.

It is named after Henry George Flanagan, a South African farmer and botanist from Komga, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Description It is more often a shrub than a small tree. The lower side of the leaves are covered in dense hairs, similar to those of the woolly bottlebrush, but the leaves are less strongly lobed around the base. Range  It is present in the hills and rocky valleys around Grahamstown, but may be found from Queenstown to Komga in the Eastern Cape. It is indicated as rare on the SANBI red data list, but is not threatened by extinction. They are usually found growing as individuals, and are distributed in about 10 known subpopulations.

Hunting's last appearance was on Exodus's 2004 album Tempo of the Damned. Title The album takes its name from an experimental novel of the same name by J.G. Ballard published in 1970. The name of the album is the same as a planned album that was to be released by the Los Angeles thrash metal outfit Dark Angel in 1992. Guitarist Gary Holt has stated it is named \\"Exhibit A\\" because Exodus had planned to release a follow up Exhibit B album soon afterward, although that album was not released until 2010. Release and reception On October 17, 2007 the entire album was uploaded on the band's MySpace page, however, many of the people that pre-ordered the album from CM Distro received it on October 19.

Flugwerk Deutschland manufactured several biplanes and a monoplane. A branch was set up for aeroengine production at Schleissheimerstrasse 8 in Munich-Milbertshofen in 1912 and Karl Rapp and Joseph Wirth were given power of attorney in Munich, on May 20, 1912. The company took part in the General Air Show in Berlin in 1912. The Taube (German for dove) had been developed in 1910 by Igo Etrich, and was built in large numbers by various manufacturers, including Flugwerk Deutschland. The Taube got its name from the structure and shape of its wings. A slow, unarmed, two- seater monoplane, it entered service in the first year of World War I and was used for observation and reconnaissance until 1916. Karl Rapp designed an FD 1416 aeroengine. The company was dissolved by a resolution of the shareholders on April 16, 1913, and Joseph Wirth was appointed as sole liquidator.

The task of the general stores issue ship was to sail into non-combat, or rear, areas and disburse general stores, such as canned goods, toilet paper, office supplies, etc., to ships and stations.  Operations  Commanding officers and supply officers of ships and stations would sign requisitions for what they required, and a small boat, such as an LCVP, would make the trip to the general stores issue ship to have the requisitions filled. General stores issue ships would provision in the States before sailing to the non-combat areas. However, rather than sail back to the United States to re-provision, they would often remain at their location and provision from general cargo ships sent from the States to replenish their stores. For example, , homeported in Yokosuka, Japan, during the 1960s, maintained an inventory of 25,000 line items, supplying Seventh Fleet units with numerous items, augmented by other supply vessels delivering specialty materials, including foods, ammunition, and fuels. During a typical underway replenishment of a naval grouping (usually a squadron), Pollux would deliver supplies, via cargo nets and highline, while steaming at typically 15 knots, alongside receiving ships. Overall material could include hundreds of items, at a typical weight total to 120 tons to an aircraft carrier, 25-35 tons to a cruiser, 6-10 tons to a destroyer, as well as commensurate amounts to auxiliary ships (troop carriers, repair vessels, etc.). Along with the emphasis of underway replenishment (UNREPs), also delivered supplies to ships in various ports as well (INREPs). It has been estimated that Pollux alone supplied as much as one-sixth of Seventh Fleet's general logistical needs.

It is currently threatened by habitat loss in its native region. Guaiacum sanctum is the national tree of the Bahamas. Properties This small tree is slow growing, reaching about in height with a trunk diameter of . The tree is essentially evergreen throughout most of its native range. It is shade tolerant. It fruits between the age for 30 and 70 years over the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere. The wood is hard, heavy and self-lubricating and has a Janka Hardness Score of 4500, which is one of the hardest in the world. It can sink when placed in water. There are fine ripple marks on the wood.Record, Samuel J. ‚ÄúTier-Like Arrangement of the Elements of Certain Woods.‚Äù Science, vol. 35, no. 889, 1912, pp. 75‚Äì77. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1638125. Leaves =Leaves= The leaves are compound, in length, and wide. They are dark green in color and occur as three to five pairs of leaflets. They fold together during the hottest parts of the day. =Flower= The purplish blue flowers have five petals each. They can grow individually or in clusters at the ends of branches. The flowers have both male and female parts (stamens and pistils) and yield yellow pods containing black seeds encapsulated separately in a red skin. Flower Uses This tree is one of two species which yield the valuable Lignum vitae wood, the other being Guaiacum officinale. The wood has been used for making specific parts of ships that needed to be self-lubricating so that they would last longer. The tree is considered to have medicinal value, used mostly for home remedies. The naturalist William Turner noted in 1568 that the plant was already being grown in India, Tamraparni (ancient Sri Lanka), Java and the Tivu islets of the ocean, and whose broth cured several harsh diseases, including French pox (Syphilis).MUNGER, ROBERT S. ‚ÄúGuaiacum, the Holy Wood from the New World.‚Äù Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences, vol. 4, no. 2, 1949, pp. 196‚Äì229.

Threats The type of rainforest (tropical-deciduous and dry forests) that holywood is found in are the most threatened ecosystems in the world. The plant was exploited until it was endangered due to use for timber and medical resin. Deforestation also occurred to create more human managed areas like farmland, cities, etc. This has caused habitat fragmentation for the species, which reduces the chances of lowering its risk status.Eric J. Fuchs, James L. Hamrick; Genetic Diversity in the Endangered Tropical Tree, Guaiacum sanctum (Zygophyllaceae), Journal of Heredity, Volume 101, Issue 3, 1 May 2010, Pages 284‚Äì291, https://doi.org/10.1093/jhered/esp127 Moreover, since this is a slow growing tree, it becomes harder to regrow and maintain sizable forests of it. It can be cultivated to grow faster, but needs to be watered regularly and to have well drained soil. It has no major pests and though there were cases of illegal trade in 2008, this is no longer a major threat to the species.

Miller's parents were both Holocaust survivors. His father was a captain in the front lines of the Russian Army during World War II and his mother was a Lithuanian who had once been held captive in a concentration camp. Both escaped the Nazis, re-united and fled to Israel. Nachume was born during their voyage, in Frankfurt, Germany, on January 28, 1949. He grew up in the town of Holon, Israel, where he was inspired by his father who spent most of his post-war days carving elaborate wood sculptures of Cubist human forms. Nachume, on the contrary, excelled in painting. By the age of 16, Miller was painting elaborate surreal dream lands referencing religion, politics and the history of Modern Art. His earlier works show similarities to Hieronymus Bosch, Salvador Dal√≠ and Francisco Goya. Miller was enlisted in the Israeli Army where he worked as one of Ariel Sharon's personal assistants and also fought in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He went to New York in 1966 to study at the School of Visual Arts, and joined the faculty in 1977 to teach painting and drawing.

He played college football at the University of Alabama. Early years Lassic attended North Rockland High School, where he helped his team achieve three straight Section 1 Class A bowl wins. As a senior, he set county records with 1,719 rushing yards, 31 total touchdowns, 26 rushing touchdowns and 194 scored points. He was named the New York State large-school Player of the Year, All- state and an USA Today‚Äôs High School All-American. He also had 31 receptions for 586 yards. He finished his high school career with 2,846 rushing yards. He also practiced track and baseball. College career Lassic accepted a football scholarship from the University of Alabama. As a redshirt freshman, he appeared in 10 games and was fifth on the team with 142 rushing yards on 33 carries. In the 32-16 win against Louisiana State University, he rushed for 58 yards on 8 carries. In the 37‚Äì14 win against the University of Southern Mississippi, he made 4 receptions for 80 yards, including a 54-yard catch. That season, Alabama won its first SEC championship since 1981. As a sophomore, he was slowed by a turf toe injury, rushing for 281 yards on 68 carries. He scored his first touchdown (an 18-yard run) in the season opener 24‚Äì27 loss against the University of Southern Mississippi. He missed the eighth game against Mississippi State University because of his toe injury. He had 11 carries for 67 yards against the University of Cincinnati. As a junior, he was the backup running back behind Siran Stacy, posting 70 carries for 368 rushing yards (third on the team) and 2 touchdowns. He had 9 carries for 70 yards against Vanderbilt University. He compiled 10 carries for 76 yards against the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga. As a senior, he was named the starter at running back, registering 905 rushing yards (fifth in the SEC) on 178 carries (5.1 yards per carry), 10 rushing touchdowns, 129 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown. He was named the 1993 Sugar Bowl MVP after Alabama beat Miami 34-13 to win the National Championship. He finished his college career 11th on the school's all-time rushing list (1,696 yards). Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Lassic was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (94th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft. The team was forced to start him in the first two games (both losses) after Emmitt Smith contract holdout extended into the regular season. He became the first rookie running back in league history to start a season opener for a defending Super Bowl champion, and the third rookie running back in franchise history to start a season opener. Although Smith signed in time for the third game against the Phoenix Cardinals, Lassic still started and led the team in rushing with 60 yards on 14 carries, while scoring his first 2 touchdowns during a 17‚Äì10 win. From that point his workload was significantly reduced, on the way to the Cowboys winning back-to-back Super Bowls. In the thirteenth game against the Minnesota Vikings, he lined up at receiver to compensate the loss of an injured Alvin Harper, when the team used three wide receiver sets. He was declared inactive in the final 3 games of the season. In 1993, he rushed 75 times for 269 yards and 3 touchdowns, but he suffered from the national pressure and the loyalty his teammates had towards Smith. Erik Williams criticized Lassic's running style, saying \\"He runs too fast. We have a flow and he isn't able to see it\\", Nate Newton said, \\"Lassic was a nice kid, but if we expected to get back to the Super Bowl, we needed Emmitt in the lineup\\". In 1994, he was limited with a torn ligament he suffered in his right knee during a pre-season game, until being placed on the injured reserve list on December 6, 1994. In Cowboys lore, he is remembered for being the starting running back for the first two games of the 1993 season when Smith held out in a contract dispute. =Carolina Panthers= The Carolina Panthers selected him from the Cowboys roster in the 20th round (40th overall) of the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft. He was waived with an injury settlement on August 27, after suffering from knee, hamstring and thigh problems during training camp. =San Francisco 49ers= On March 18, 1996, Lassic signed with the San Francisco 49ers. He was waived on July 29. =Toronto Argonauts (CFL)= In 1998, he signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League and was waived on August 17.

Design The SM-93 was an all-wood single- engined low-wing monoplane with retractable undercarriage. The fuselage had a monocoque structure, with a single fin and low-set tailplane. The crew of two were accommodated under a long greenhouse-style canopy, with the pilot lying in a prone position above the rear of the engine, a Daimler-Benz DB 605A liquid-cooled V12 engine, while the gunner/radio-operator sat facing rearwards on a conventional seat. The two-spar wings were in three parts with the inner wings sharply tapered to the join, outboard of the landing gear attachments, and the outer wings moderately tapered to the rounded wingtips.Air International August 1982, p. 98. The prone position for the pilot was intended to enable the pilot to resist the onset of g-induced loss of consciousness, but the position was uncomfortable for normal flight and severely limited the rearwards view of the pilot. Development The SM.93 made its maiden flight on 31 January 1944, and up to 29 March 1944 the SM-93 had made 16 test-flights with speeds up to achieved in a dive, demonstrating the low drag and clean aerodynamics. Operational history Flight testing was carried out under the aegis of the Luftwaffe and despite the good performance, the prone position was found to be unsatisfactory, being uncomfortable and restricting rearward vision. The programme was halted by the German control Commission that was running weapons production in the Repubblica Sociale Italiana - RSI after the 1943 armistice.

Enjoying large crowds across the nation, they have had successes at music festivals such as the Sziget Festival. Together for over 25 years, the band has a large collection of studio albums and one live CD/DVD combo to their credit.  Band history  = Roots = The band originated in the industrial town of Duna√∫jv√°ros under the name 'Okt√≥ber', playing covers. By the end of high school, the band dispersed. The Kiss brothers, Tibor and Endre, got another group together in 1991, and renamed it 'Quimby'. = 1991 to 1995: Saloon start - Jerrycan Dance = In 1992 the band's first cassette entitled Up Side Down was released, featuring English-language tunes such as \\"Sea,\\" \\"Stink,\\" \\"I Give You My Shoes,\\" \\"Up Side Down,\\" \\"Never Get By,\\" and \\"Policeman\\". The band's style was compared to the chansons and cabaret songs from the period between the World Wars. The band played at pubs in Pest. By 1993 the personnel consisted of Tibor Kiss (vocals and guitar), Endre Kiss (guitar), Livius Varga (percussion and vocals), Tam√°s Sz√©n Moln√°r (saxophone), Ferenc Mikuli (bass guitar), and √Åkos Medve (drums). In 1993 they recorded their second album, Sip of Story. This album also came out on cassette and had English lyrics. During this period the band was one of the most successful club bands in Budapest, and also popular on the college and festival circuit. At this point the elder Kiss brother, Endre, left the band. He was replaced by a young piano player, Szil√°rd Balanyi, who was born in Balatonf√ºred. With this new line-up the band recorded its next album, Jerrycan Dance, which came out on CD but in a limited edition. This album is also in English and it begins to show some of the main characteristics which are seen in the present band. = 1995 to 1997: Language change - Majom-tang√≥ = In 1995, the band decided to focus more on writing songs in Hungarian. By the summer of 1996 the new album was finished: Majom-tang√≥ (Monkey Tango). This album contains mostly Hungarian songs, but there are three English ones. The album has an eclectic style: there are several folk songs featured in the usual chanson-epic style of Quimby, especially Roma and Latin folk music; then reggae and psychedelic effects are incorporated. Majom-tang√≥ is the direct antecedent of their present style. = 1997 to 1999: Breakthrough - Diligram = The release of Majom-tang√≥ immediately led to a rise in popularity on the Hungarian music scene. The band moved from being a phenomenon on the alternative stage to wider popularity with the appearance of Diligramm (Loonygramme) in December 1997. Diligramm is a complete work of a mature band. The lyrics are crisper, the musical palette more colorful; the band found its own style. The CD was introduced by a video and single, \\"Once There Was a Time\\", and by a memorable CD release concert. Quimby enjoyed many successes in their live performances, with more concerts in front of larger audiences. In the spring of 1998 the Hungarian press chose Diligramm the album of the year. =1999 to 2000: Mature band - √âkszerelm√©re = The new album √âkszerelm√©re was highly anticipated even before it was released in November 1999. Producing the record proved a little complex when early in the year Livius Varga lost the tape containing ideas for new songs while he was traveling on the tram in Budapest. √âkszerelm√©re is even more mature and composed than the previous album. The music is strict but playful, uniform but discursive, realistic but ascendent, and traditionalist. While the band uses the implementations of modern music, the lyrics are cruel and ironic; stories and verbal psychedelia are present. After the recording of √âkszerelm√©re the band released Tam√°s Moln√°r (saxophone). After a long search his place was filled by J√≥zsef K√°rp√°ti, a trumpet and piano player from the band 'Andersen'. The band stepped on stage at that year's Sziget Festival in this form. =2000 to 2002: Morzs√°k and K√°osz Amigos = During this period the band performed at festival concerts in Hungary and abroad, and went on a mini-tour of Germany. In the spring of 2001 Quimby released a new album called Morzs√°k √©s Szil√°nkok (Crumbs and Splinters). It contained remixes featuring unknown, young, talented remixers, together with concert recordings of older songs. Singer Tibor Kiss said the album presented the material \\"with a sort of continuous modality, like a film, building upon each other one after the other\\". In 2002, the album K√°osz Amigos (Chaos Amigos) did not disappoint fans. The album takes the musical oeuvre of Quimby to a new point of view. It is a musical-lyrical adventure in a troubled, intensive, vibrating, sensitive, dynamic, tragic, humorous, often tragicomic world. This album contains 10 songs in 43 minutes. In spite of the shorter playtime the album is a colorful, exciting and amusing musical roller-coaster. The songs are memorable but not hits in the usual sense. There are Spanish-like chansons with stiff rhythms, interesting guitar work, agile and bop songs. There are also fancy, moderate, slow songs and rap, even childhood sayings. The album features percussion instruments, guitar, bass, keyboards, modern electronics and trumpet by the newest member of the band, J√≥zsef K√°rp√°ti. =2002 to 2004: hiatus = The band had just completed touring the new album in Hungary when frontman Tibor Kiss needed an extended break for rest and relaxation, so the band went on hiatus. Though its wasn't known ahead of time how long the break would be, the pause lasted until 2004. After an intensive probation period and a return concert, Quimby rejoined the Hungarian public music scene once again with enormous power. Full-house concerts were held in Budapest and other venues, along with a successful \\"Night Invasion\\" concert in Spring 2004 and appearances at the big summer festivals, including the Sziget Festival. The band continued from where they left off: reviewers and fans said the band was in good shape, perhaps even better than before. =2005 to present: Kil√©gz√©s and Family Tuged√∂r = The album Kil√©gz√©s (Exhalation, October 2005) became an important work in the band's history. It is an interesting milestone because it opened a new era from an artistic point of view. Memories from their previous phase are presented in a new context, in a re-evaluated form. Tibor Kiss doesn‚Äôt mince now, there is no nostalgia, no great truths revealed, but only the music with its ironic, emotional, expressive style. In 2006 the band reached the 15-year milestone. Quimby celebrated this special jubilee by publishing a greatest hits recording and DVD called Family Tuged√∂r. They also gave a double concert in the Katona J√≥zsef Theatre, one in the Pet≈ëfi Csarnok venue and a concert on 1 January 2007 called \\"Magic Music\\". The work continues with two releases in 2009, an EP (Ajjajjaj) and a full length album (L√°rmagy≈±jt√∂get≈ë).

It was the successor of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.75. Design and development The SM.95 was announced in 1937, when the future was seen in the 4-engined aircraft. Until that time Italy had mainly used 3-engined aircraft. The SM.95, designed by Alessandro Marchetti, first flew on 8 May 1943. Originally named SM.76 it was fitted with four 750 hp A.R. 126 RC.34. In 1939 the project was renamed SM.95C (C for Civil), with the more powerful Alfa Romeo RC.18 (860 hp) engine. With the start of World War II, this project was stopped until December 1941, when L.A.T.I. called for a 4-engined useful for South American routes. It had, nevertheless, inferior performances compared to Piaggio P.108C and CANT Z.511A, both metallic and more powerful. But the new SM.95 had lower costs and a swifter development. The aircraft was similar to other contemporary airliners, but the construction was mixed. Welded steel was used for the fuselage structure, with light alloy covering fitted to the nose, underside and rear fuselage, and fabric covering for the fuselage sides and roof. The three-spar wing was also of wooden construction, with plywood skinning.Stroud 1992, pp. 65‚Äì66. The engines drove three-bladed metal constant speed propellers.Stroud 1992, p.66. The two pilots sat side by side in an enclosed cockpit, while behind them sat the flight engineer (on the left) and radio operator (on the right). Behind the cockpit, there was normally seating for 20‚Äì30 passengers, with up to 38 being able to be carried over short ranges. There was an initial need for a bomber version, SM.95B, with enhanced engines and a weapon set. Nevertheless, the first to fly was the SM.95C, on 3 August 1943,Stroud 1992, p.65. at Vergiate, with Guglielmo Algarotti flying. Operational history Italy's armistice with the Allies in September 1943 stopped the program, and the only two aircraft built at the time were requisitioned by the Germans and sent to Germany, where they flew with the Luftwaffe and were subsequently lost. On 28 July 1945, a third example flew, used with a fourth (still unfinished at the end of the war) with the Aeronautica Militare. One was taken by the RAF. The service with A.M. started after April 1946. Alitalia bought six examples, in service from 1947. LATI bought three examples in 1949. Lastly, four SM.95s were bought by SAIDE. They were used on the Cairo-Rome-Paris route. The only military customer was AMI, which had five of them. SM.95C was a development model. The first were produced with AR.128 RC.18, the third with A.R. 131 RC.14/50, the next examples had Bristol Pegasus 48 (1,005 hp), and LATI used even more powerful Twin Wasp R-1830 (1,217 hp). A final development, the SM.95S with a metal structure, was planned but not built. Manchester Ringway Airport in April 1948 when operating a scheduled service via London to Rome The last SM.95 was completed on 18 November 1949, the last of twenty officially built. They had an unexceptional performance, even with PW engines, and had no pressurization at all, therefore they could not fly very high. The mixed construction did not last too long: the last flight was on 28 September 1954 (1950 with Alitalia). On January 27th 1951, lightning struck the Alitalia Savoia-Marchetti SM.95B Ugolino Vivaldi (registration I-DALO) - named after the Italian navigator and explorer Ugolino Vivaldi - during a flight from Paris-Le Bourget Airport in Paris, France, to Roma-Ciampino Airport in Rome, Italy. The aircraft caught fire and crashed north of Civitavecchia, Italy, killing 14 of the 17 people on board.Aviation Safety Network: Accident Description =Operation \\"S\\"= The interest for a military use was confirmed with a very daring mission: the bombing of New York. In July 1939, the S.M.75 obtained a record of 12,935 km (8,034 mi), there were several long-range missions both with S.M.82 and the S.M.75, while for S operation it was considered the 4-engined CANT Z.511, an all-metal floatplane. It had, however, some shortcomings: basically it needed to be refuelled by a submarine in the middle of the ocean. Although it was able to operate in adverse sea conditions (up to force-5 gales), this was not a very good idea, especially in the last year of war. It was proposed that a long-range version of this aircraft, the SM.95 GA (with a range of over 11,000 km/6,840 mi) could be used to mount a bombing raid on New York City launched from Western France, but the presence of many Italian-Americans in the city meant that Benito Mussolini would only authorize the dropping of propaganda pamphlets. It was reported that the fuel load was raised to 23,800 kg, for a total of 39,3 tons.Pesce, Giuseppe. \\"Operazione S.\\" Storia Militare, Albertelli editions, N.49, October 1997, p. 30. The mission, with a 500 kg (1,100 lb) load, was still in preparation when Italy signed the Armistice in September 1943.

J. Scott and starring Bolo Yeung, Jalal Merhi, Billy Blanks, Bobbie Phillips, Matthias Hues, Harry Mok, and Kelly Gallant. The film was written by T.J. Scott from a story by J. Stephen Maunder and Richard M. Samuels and produced by Merhi. The soundtrack was composed by VaRouje.  Plot  In 2020, ecological disaster has driven the wealthy to an underground city. Jason Storm is part of an elite security force called the Tracker-Communicators who protect the city against the surface world survivors who could not afford to escape. Zoey Kinsella, the deceased founder's daughter, joins him as his rookie partner. After a raid by starving surface world survivors breaches the city's force field, Zoey comes to believe they have inside help. Storm acknowledges the possibility but is more concerned with his clashes against the Controller, the leader of the city's security, and his enforcer, Bigalow. The Controller wants to use a cybernetic project to replace the Tracker-Communicators, but he can not find any volunteers Niki Picasso and his gang penetrate the underground city's force field and head directly to a disused area of the city. There, in a hidden cache, they find ammunition and an automatic rifle, a weapon that has become extremely rare. While Picasso pins down Storm and Kinsella, an unseen adversary shoots Kinsella dead. Convinced of a coverup, Storm angrily resigns, only to have the Controller send Bigalow to kill him. When Storm escapes the city, the Controller frames him for Kinsella's death and sets the security forces after him. Unknown to Storm, the Controller has Kinsella resurrected as a cyborg and programs her to be his personal assassin. Her first mission is to seduce Picasso and recruit him to take over a research facility guarded by the Lifers, a powerful gang. On the surface world, Storm encounters a martial arts master, Sumai, and his daughter. Sumai helps Storm infiltrate Picasso's lair, but the cybernetic Kinsella easily defeats Storm. As Storm recovers, Sumai trains him. Sumai, former head of security at the research facility, tells Storm that Kinsella's father was the person who founded it. The facility was originally meant to counter the ecological damage but was converted into a chemical weapons factory. Suspecting that the Controller seeks the biological weapons to take over the surface world, Storm and Sumai recruit fighters who are willing to stand up to Picasso. As Picasso overpowers the Lifers with his rifle, the Controller murders the city's leader, the Overlord, and joins him. After launching the chemical weapons, the Controller double-crosses Picasso. As the Controller flees the facility, Picasso confronts and kills him, though he left trapped in a silo. The chemicals, though currently inert, will kill every surface dweller unless a countdown is aborted. After defeating Bigalow and his men, Storm and Sumai break into the control room, where the Controller has left Kinsella. Storm helps her to remember her true self, and she guesses several passwords. Finally, with time running out, Sumai guesses the correct password and saves the surface world. Picasso calls for help; when they ignore him, he vows revenge.

Wales won the match 7‚Äì3, the first time the side had won at Twickenham for 23 years. The following year, Jenkins missed the opening match of the 1934 Home Nations Championship against England. He rejoined the side ahead of its victory over Scotland, in which he kicked two conversions, and became the first Welsh full back to score a try in an international fixture when he scored ran in a try against Ireland in the final match.

Although disrupted by injury, he was the team's second- highest scorer with 50 points during the tour. He won his final cap for Wales the following year, in a 3‚Äì0 defeat to England. Personal life Jenkins married Susan Fraser in 1940 and the couple had one son together. His wife died in 1984. After graduating from Jesus College, Jenkins took up a teaching position at Dover College alongside his sporting career.

After the war ended, Jenkins became a rugby reporter for the News of the World and later The Sunday Times. He served as the editor of Rothmans Rugby Yearbook for 11 years and wrote several books on the sport.
