The theater was landmarked and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2007. Early history The basement lounge in 2005. Designed by Rapp & Rapp, the theater opened on October 30, 1921 as the Mainstreet Missouri. The 3,200-seat theater was a popular vaudeville and movie house, and the only theater in Kansas City designed by Chicago firm Rapp and Rapp. The interior was designed in French Baroque style, and the exterior is a blend of neoclassical and French Second Empire. The lobby is topped by a dome encircled by circular windows. The Mainstreet Theater was the largest theater in Kansas City until the Midland Theatre opened in 1927. The Mainstreet was the first theater in Kansas City to have a nursery for children whose parents were attending a show. Located in the basement and staffed by a trained nurse, it offered toys and games for older children and cribs for babies. A tunnel connected the theater's lower level to the nearby President Hotel at 14th and Baltimore. Built to allow actors to enter the theater from their dressing rooms, it became infamous as a passage for bootleggers to escape police during Prohibition. The supposed tunnel is not shown on the Sanborn fire insurance map for 1939 (The Sanborn Map Co., New York, Kansas City 1939-1940 vol. 1, 1939, Sheet 34). The theater also had space in the basement and sub-basement to keep animals for vaudeville shows. The space included an elephant cage, a pool for seals, and an elevator large and powerful enough to haul elephants to the stage. Noted performers such as Cab Calloway, Charlie Chaplin, Harry Lauder, the Marx Brothers, and Olsen and Johnson headlined at the vaudeville house. In the early 1920s, at the height of the theater's popularity, attendance averaged over 4,000 daily. The Mainstreet Theater's name changed to the RKO Missouri Theater in April 1941. The RKO Missouri ran Cinerama three strip film. The AMC Era AMC Theatres, then known as Durwood Theatres, bought the theater in the late 1950s and reopened it in December 1960 as the Empire. The first film shown at the theater under the new name was Exodus. The new Empire's seating configuration was reduced to 1260 to accommodate modern amenities and technology. Durwood replaced the Empire's three strip Cinerama with the seamless 70 mm film version. The 70 by Walker Hi Gain motion picture screen was designed to collapse, fold, and store on stage within two and a half hours to allow for quick conversion for live stage events. The stage curtain measured more than and claimed to be the world's largest. In keeping with Kansas City's reputation as the \\"City of Fountains\\", the Empire included decorative fountains in the box office area and at the main staircase. The prominent signage suspended from scaffolding attached to the building's roof during the \\"Mainstreet\\" and \\"RKO Missouri\\" eras was removed when Durwood converted the theater to the Empire. The Empire kept an organist until 1961 when there was a dispute with the musicians' union. In 1967, the theater was split in two when a second theater was constructed in the former balcony of the original theater. In 1980 AMC converted the Empire into four theaters and it was known as Empire 4 Theaters. Two of the additional theaters were in the upper level where the original balcony once existed. The Empire stopped screening films and closed in 1985. In 1972, as a protest against what it called \\"cultural prejudices\\", the Italian American Unification Council in Kansas City spent $2,500 to purchase all the seats of the premier showing of Francis Ford Coppola‚Äôs film The Godfather at the Empire. While the film played to an empty house, the Council sponsored a benefit dance down the street.\\"Blackhand Strawman.\\"\\" .\\" An Uncertain Future Construction workers involved in the early stages of Power & Light District construction seek shade under the marquee of the abandoned Empire Theater on a hot summer day in 2005. A glimpse of the trees growing from the roof can be seen to the right of the dome. Prominent downtown landowner Larry Bridges purchased the Empire Theater in 1986 from Stan Durwood, then CEO of AMC Theatres. Between 1985 and 2005, the Empire was often at risk for demolition. Numerous efforts took place to prevent each demolition attempt. In 1986, actor and comedian George Burns joined the effort and wrote a letter to have the theater declared a historic landmark. Since the theater was not listed as a local landmark or listed on the National Register of Historic Places, there was not much legal protection to prevent the deteriorating structure's demolition. Owner Larry Bridges expressed desire to raze the Empire several times and even obtained a pre- demolition inspection permit from the city in August 2003. Bridges planned to team with DST Realty to build a new headquarters for Kansas City Power & Light on the site. The City of Kansas City blocked the plan, which had called for saving the facade but demolishing the core structure of the Empire. In 2004, the Kansas City Chapter of the American Institute of Architects compiled a list of 25 buildings in the central business district believed to be significant downtown landmarks \\"worthy of attention and reuse\\". The Empire Theater was listed as the most endangered building at the time: The building had fallen into such disrepair that bricks fell from the building and trees sprouted from the roof. Redevelopment The City of Kansas City reached an agreement to purchase the theater from Larry Bridges in late 2004 while it was acquiring properties for the future Power and Light District. In November 2005, the State of Missouri approved up to $938,538 in Brownfields Redevelopment Program remediation tax credits to help offset costs involved in the cleanup of asbestos at the theater. An estimated 200 dump-truck loads of asbestos and mold-covered debris were removed from the theater during the cleanup process. Power & Light District developer Cordish reached an agreement with AMC to form a joint venture, Midland-Empire Partners LLC, to redevelop the Empire Theater and the nearby Midland Theatre. Re-Opening The AMC Mainstreet Theater opened to the public under its original name as part of the Power & Light District on May 1, 2009, after a test period of playing second- run films for employees and invited guests beginning April 18, 2009. The theater also hosted the Kansas City Film Festival April 22‚Äì26, 2009. AMC stated the Mainstreet is its \\"flagship theater\\", spending $30 million on the renovation. The renovated theater's ground floor has three standard auditoriums, while the upper level features \\"cinema suites\\" with reclining loungers, food trays, and a call button to summon a server. All auditoriums feature 4k digital projectionAMC to Get Sony Digital Projectors - New York Times - March 29, 2009 and 11 channel sound, including overhead speakers and bass shakers mounted under the seats. AMC claims it is one of the world's most technologically advanced theater setups. The lobby area features a restaurant called The Marquee which opened on Friday, March 27, 2009. Early reports claimed the theater would feature \\"documentaries, independent, and foreign films\\", but upon opening the selection was limited to mainstream Hollywood films. On May 26, 2009, the theater was awarded the \\"Dr. George Ehrlich Achievement in Preservation Award\\" by the Historic Kansas City Foundation.

Challenger mobile/wireless network operators and service providers ECTA members are some of the primary innovators in implementation of advanced telecommunications and broadband services History The European Competitive Telecommunications Association was formed in 1998 by Robert J. Dombkowski and Elizabeth J. Schumacher, the married couple who were founders of MCN, UK, and members of the Institute of Telecom resellers in Europe which, under the leadership of Barrington Roy Schiller had brought together a group of telecommunications resellers and suppliers in Europe in order to benefit from deregulation of the telecommunications market across Western and Eastern Europe. The founding members included high ranking executives of the major telecom players in Europe including Nick Jeffries of Cable and Wireless, Michael Potter venture capitalist of Paradigm Ventures specialized in telecom start-ups and film director of Orphans of Apollo, Hans Gerber of SITA-Equant, Gustav Schaefer of Unisource Carrier Services, Ian Ashby of Lucent Technologies, Claude Simpson, the president of Immix Telecom (ECTA Member of the Year, 1999), Holland Taylor of USA GlobalLink, and Michael Rhodes of Coudert Brothers. Prior to 1987, (False) the European telecommunications market consisted predominantly of monopolies or telecommunications organizations (TO's) such as BT, France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. In 1987, the European Union adopted the 1987 Green Paper that essentially stated it was in Europe's best interests to overhaul the current system and liberalize telecommunications services. As a result, from 1988 to 1998 the European Commission adopted multiple directives that obligated member states to open markets for equipment, telecom services, value-added, data services, satellite, mobile and voice to competition. Member States set up national regulatory agencies (NRA's) that oversaw these directives and developed policies and procedures for telecommunications organizations to follow. The directives provided a framework for the EU commission to ensure compliance and take judicial action when necessary. In 1990 the Open Network Provision (ONP) Framework Directive was adopted by the EU that established regulations for open access to the existing infrastructure and networks, interconnection and 'fair pricing' for resellers. ECTA was established as a result of restrictive practices by former monopolies to limit activities by resellers to access networks and obtain fair pricing. Committees were established within the organization to collectively respond to new EU directives and written and 'unwritten' policies that were carried out by NRA's. ECTA responded to numerous proposed directives and called for regulations to be developed to better protect reseller interests and encourage enforcement in the spirit of the original 1987 Green Paper. ECTA has contributed white papers and had input into many policy telecom policies since its inception in 1997. ECTA also serves as a forum for carriers and resellers to meet and discuss openly issues that are in the interests of the parties. ECTA has also served to educate the telecommunications market, providing information and market research on European telecommunications as well as a market forum for new products and services.

Radio frequency energies occupy 1.0 x 104 Hz to 3.0 x 1011 Hz of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radio frequency electromagnetic energy is routinely produced by RF electrical circuits connected to a transducer, usually an antenna.The ARRL Handbook for Radio amateurs. Newington, The American Radio Relay League, Inc. CT, 06111 USA, 1997, Pulsed radio frequency waveforms The figure below shows an example of a generalized pulsed radio frequency waveform as seen with an oscilloscope with an antenna probe. In this example there are 1000 pulses per second (one kilohertz pulse rate) with a gated pulse width of 42 Œºs. The pulse packet frequency in this example is 27.125 megahertz (MHz) of RF energy. The duty cycle for a pulsed radio frequency is the percent time the RF packet is on, 4.2% for this example ([0.042 ms X 1000 pulses divided by 1000 ms/s] X 100). The pulse packet form can be a square, triangle, sawtooth or sine wave. In several applications of pulse radio frequency, such as radar,Le Chevalier, Francois. Principles of Rader and Sonar Signal Processing, Artech House, Boston, London, 2002. times between pulses can be modulated. The pulse packet frequency in this example is 27.125 MHz of RF energy Use in radar The best understood and applied use of pulse radio frequency electromagnetic energy is their use in radar (radio detection and ranging).Skolnik, Merrill, I., Introduction to Radar System, McGraw-Hill, 2001, The uses of radar are diverse and applied to military, civilian and space exploration. Radar is based on the reflection or scatter of pulsed radiofrequency waves emitted from a transmitter which are then detected by an antenna which then determines the range, speed, and direction of objects. In most uses the transmitter and detector are located at the same location. Radio frequencies used with radar are from 3 megahertz (MHz) to 300 gigahertz (GHz) depending on the type and application. Therapeutic uses Pulsed radiofrequency fields are an emerging technology used in the medical field for the treatment of tumors, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic and post-operative pain, bone fracture, and soft tissue wounds. There are two general categories of pulsed radiofrequency field therapies based on their mechanism of action: thermal and non-thermal (athermal).Pilla, A., A., ed. \\"Mechanism and Therapeutic Applications of Time- Varying and Static magnetic Fields\\". third ed. Biological and Medical Aspects of Electromagnetic Fields, ed. F. Barnes, S., Greenebaum, B. 2007, CRC Press: Boca Raton. 449, While thermal radiofrequency ablation for tumors and cardiac arrhythmia has been used for over 25 years, non-thermal pulsed radio frequency is currently being developed for the ablation of cardiac arrhythmias and tumors. The technique uses pulsed radio frequency energy delivered via catheter at frequencies of 300‚Äì750 kHz for 30 to 60 seconds. Thermal pulsed radio frequency takes advantage of high current delivered focally by an electrode to ablate the tissue of interest. Generally the tissue/electrode temperature reached is 60 to 75 ¬∞C resulting in focal tissue destruction. Thermal pulse radio frequency ablation has also been used for lesioning of peripheral nerves to reduce chronic pain. Non thermal therapeutic uses of pulsed radio frequency are currently being used to treat pain and edema, chronic wounds, and bone repair. Pulsed radiofrequency therapy technologies are described by the acronyms EMF (electromagnetic field), PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic fields),Basset, C.A., \\"Fundamental and practical aspects of therapeutic uses of pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF)\\".

These technologies have been varied in terms of their electric and magnetic field energies as well as in the pulse length, duty cycle, treatment time and mode of delivery. Although pulsed radiofrequency has been used for medical treatment purposes for decades, peer reviewed publications assessing the efficacy and physiological mechanism(s) are now starting to appear addressing this technology. Natural sources Natural occurring sources of pulsed radiofrequency exist in the form of stars called pulsars. Pulsars were discovered in 1967 using a radio telescope.Burke, B.F., Graham-Smith, F., An Introduction to Radio Astronomy, Cambridge University Press, 2001, These stars are thought to be rapidly spinning neutron stars. These stars have powerful magnetic fields which cause the star to emit strong radio frequencies. Different sizes of pulsars pulse at different rates.

Although they may still enter competitions, winning is not the soul surfer's main motive, since they scorn the commercialization of surfing. The term denotes a spirituality of surfing. As Brad Melekian stated in a 2005 article in Surfer magazine: > to pursue surfing not just as an athletic endeavor or as a sunny day > diversion, but to try to glean whatever lessons you can from the practice. > It means being aware of your surroundings, and respectful of the people and > places that you interact with. It means being patient, mindful, kind, > compassionate, understanding, active, thoughtful, faithful, hopeful, > gracious, disciplined and...good.Melekian, Brad. March 2005, \\"Is God a > Goofyfoot?\\", Surfer, 46/3, p. 115. The term originates from a 1963 surf instrumental of the same name. History The first published mention of the term was in the 1963 surf guitar instrumental \\"Soul Surfer\\", by the Southern California surf guitarist Johnny Fortune. The song was intended to reference the then-current soul music genre. The term \\"soul surfing\\" gained popularity in the late '60s, with the phrase most used in the mid- and late-'70s.Surfline  Who the F&*K Knows In 1969 theologian Tom Blake penned an article entitled \\"Voice of the Wave\\", which examined the religious elements of surfing. By the early 70s, curious surfers began to experiment with various Eastern philosophies, such as yoga and meditation. The concept of the soul surfer was the main focus for the 1987 film North Shore, where the lead character fails to win a major surf competition because someone cheated, yet, unfazed, shrugs his shoulders and remarks that ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter to a soul surfer‚Äù. This was also a concept expounded in the 1994 film The Endless Summer II, a documentary which sees two talented surfers go around the world to emulate the original film, The Endless Summer. More recently, the phrase was used as the title of a book about Bethany Hamilton,Hamilton B (2004) Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family and Fighting to Get Back on the Board Simon & Schuster a young female surfer who continued to surf after her arm was bitten off by a tiger shark. The book was made into a 2011 feature film, also called Soul Surfer. Soul surfing has been described as ‚Äúthe highest level, the pinnacle of surfing spirituality equivalent to Nirvana, Satori, and total enlightenment, but is rarely attained.

He was a writer and political philosopher.  Early life and education  Kumanudi comes from the Greek family, which originated from Adrianople. His ancestors settled in Belgrade in 1823 or 1829. Konstantin, nicknamed Kosta, was born on 22 November 1874 in Belgrade, to Hermina, n√©e Gruber, and Dimitrije Kumanudi. Some sources erroneously name his father as Atanasije. He finished the gymnasium in Belgrade and the Legal section of the Belgrade's Great School. He then moved to Paris where he graduated at the √âcole Libre des Sciences Politiques, also obtaining his PhD there in 1901. After returning to Belgrade, Kumanudi first worked as a customs officer in 1902. Same year he was elected to the position of a docent for the administrative law at the Great School. In 1904 he was elected an associate professor while he became the full professor of the public law at the Law School in 1920.  Academic work  Kumanudi published his expert contributions in the Archive for the legal and social sciences. He was also Archive's editor for administrative law. He and Slobodan Jovanoviƒá published Basics of the public law in the Kingdom of Serbia, Volumes I & II, in Belgrade in 1907 and 1909. He authored a textbook Administrative law, published in Belgrade in 1921. His other legal works include International law among the South Slavs (1896; expanded translation of the lengthy study by Milenko Vesniƒá), Alliance treaties in the 19th century (1901), Administrative law (1909; 1920), Our jurisprudence, Tirgo, Legal position of the resigning ministers, View on Austrian role in the eastern question, etc. He was a contributor to the Serbian Literary Herald, Nova Evropa, Arhiv, Braniƒç and other papers and magazines.  Politics  Kumanudi was originally a member of the Democratic Party. On 20 July 1933 he switched to the Yugoslav National Party, which is often confused with the extremely right . After World War I he was a member of the Serbian, and later SHS delegation to the Commission for the Reparations in Paris. As the SHS delegate, he participated in the sessions of the Assembly of the League of Nations in 1924 and 1927. He also represented Yugoslav parliament in the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Geneva. He held numerous ministerial tenures in the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was later renamed Yugoslavia. He helmed the ministries of finance (17 January 1921 ‚Äì 16 December 1922), interior (acting; 30 July-14 August 1922), forestry and mining (17 April-21 September 1927), preparation for the constitutional assembly and laws equalization (acting; 17 April-16 June 1927), education (21 September 1927 ‚Äì 23 February 1928), post and telegraphs (acting; 14 January-3 April 1929), without portfolio (3 April 1929 ‚Äì 16 February 1931), construction (16 February-19 June 1931) and trade and industry (19 April 1931 ‚Äì 6 January 1932). As a finance minister, he drafted the first budget adopted in the Kingdom of the Serb, Croats and Slovenes parliament. He concluded the massive internal loan (500 million dinars at the time) in 1921 and promulgated the law on the tax equalization in 1922. He especially gained good reputation during his position as the finance minister, because of the highly favorable 1922 Blair loan in America, worth $100 million. He was elected a deputy to the Constitutional Assembly in 1920 and, as a member of the Democratic Party, of the Parliament of Yugoslavia in 1923 and 1925 elections. He was a president of the parliament from December 1931 to February 1935. In that capacity he personally accompanied the widowed dowager queen Maria of Yugoslavia and the young king Peter II to the funeral of the assassinated king Alexander I. Kumanudi withdrew from the politics in 1938.  Mayor of Belgrade  One of the major symbols of Belgrade today, the Pobednik monument, is the greatest legacy of Kumanudi as a mayor Kumanudi was mayor of Belgrade from 22 August 1926 to 18 February 1929.Mayors of Belgrade from 1839 (in Serbian), City of Belgrade official site As a mayor, he significantly enhanced and modernized the city. = Pobednik monument = His tenure, however, was marked by the scandal surrounding the erection of the Pobednik monument. The construction of the monument, originally named \\"Herald of the victory\\", dragged on since 1913 when the city decided to erect it. Various projects were made, including the placing of the monument in the fountain on Terazije, the central city square. As soon as he took over, Kumanudi pushed to project to finally get it done. When the construction of the foundations began in May 1927, the scandal broke out. Instigated by the author and jurist Petar Odaviƒá, the campaign against the monument began. Odaviƒá published an article in the Vreme magazine, attacking the sculpture claiming it insults the moral of chaste Belgrade ladies, so as the memory on Serbian soldiers which it was to represent, by not having \\"symbols of the Serbian soldiers\\", like the ≈°ajkaƒça hat or the opanak footwear. The debates and criticism ensued, including various women organizations, who protested against the sculpture of a fully naked man in city center. \\"Pobednik\\", sculptured by Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, was defended by numerous members of Serbian academia, like Bogdan Popoviƒá, Stevan Hristiƒá, Branislav Petronijeviƒá, Ksenija Atanasijeviƒá, Zora Petroviƒá, Beta Vukanoviƒá or Stanislav Krakov, but also from certain women organizations and parts of the church. Still, the Arts Commission, formed by the city, decided in September 1927 to relocate the monument and place it \\"on the ridge of the Belgrade Town, at the mouth of the Sava and the Danube\\". As Kumanudi had other duties in the state government, this decision was confirmed by his deputy Kosta Jovanoviƒá, and Kumanudi was neither aware or notified about it. Marking 10 years from the Salonica Front, the monument was dedicated on 7 October 1928. In time, the \\"Pobednik\\" became a symbol of the city.  World War II  Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941, occupied it and partitioned it. A collaborationist government, headed by Milan Aƒáimoviƒá, was installed in occupied Serbia. Though retired for several years, Kumanudi signed the Appeal to the Serbian Nation. The Appeal, published on 13 August 1941, though appeared to be gathering the population against the Bolshevism and Communism, actually was calling not to oppose the German occupation and to collaborate with the quisling governments of Aƒáimoviƒá and his successor Milan Nediƒá (Government of National Salvation).Cohen, Philip J. Serbia's secret war: propaganda and the deceit of history, Texas A&M; University Press, 1996 Kumanudi, however, restrained from any further participation. During the war he took no part in political or public life in Serbia, nor he participated in the formation of Nediƒá's government or in the government itself. He was detained three times by the Gestapo and spent some time in the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade. However, he was often asked for an advice by the administration.  Post-war  Sentencing at the Trial of Mihailoviƒá et al.. Kumanudi is the first from the right After the war, he was apprehended by the new Communist authorities. He was tried as part of the Belgrade Process and declared a \\"member of the pro-Fascist Yugoslav Radical Union, an extreme Fascist and signer of the Nediƒá's Appeal\\". Because of his \\"open Fascism and betrayal of his people and country\\" he was sentenced to 18 Months in jail. However, he was never a member of the Yugoslav Radical Union, nor the historiography confirms that he was an \\"extreme Fascist\\". His entire estate was confiscated in 1946. Kumanudi was imprisoned in the Sremska Mitrovica Prison, from 2 March 1946 to 3 November 1947. A year later, he was arrested again and accused of \\"joining the foundation of an illegal board in August 1948 in Belgrade, with the goal of rounding up of the elements hostile to the state and social organization\\". Military court sentenced him on 3 February 1951 to 10 years of hard labor with compulsory work and stripped him of his citizen rights for the next 2 years, except from the parental rights. He was sent back to Sremska Mitrovica on 24 June 1950, but due to the age and bad health, the sentence was reduced by 3 years in November 1953 and he was released on 6 November 1956. Kumanudi was tortured in prison, but with \\"the smartness of an old politician\\", he managed to survive the imprisonment, despite his old age. He was even taken by the UDBA, the secret police, to their special section which dealt with the comments of the daily press, communiques, estimate of the political situation in the world, etc. His reports were noted for the \\"archaic style\\", especially his translations from the French language. His supervisors noted his \\"diligence\\", but historians define it as a \\"mimicry for survival\\". He died on 27 November 1962 in Belgrade.  Personal life  Kumanudi was known for having \\"tactile and extremely nice\\" approach. He was described as having a \\"personality of aristocratic habitus\\". Kumanudi was a Freemason. He married Milica, n√©e Jovanoviƒá. They had three children, two sons and a daughter. Older son, Stanislav Kumanudi, nicknamed Sa≈°ko, was born in 1903, and worked as a lawyer. Younger son, Ivan Kumanudi, was a clerk in the finance ministry, but was better known as an athlete. He was a footballer in the SK Jugoslavija football club.

Overview FRS creates facility identification records through verification and management procedures that incorporate information from EPA's program-specific national data systems, state master facility records, data collected from the agency's Central Data Exchange registrations and data management personnel. The FRS provides Internet access to a single integrated source of comprehensive environmental regulatory and compliance information about facilities, sites or places. This includes the national air and water pollution programs, solid and hazardous waste handling, and enforcement activities. The FRS responds to the increasing demand for access to information and the public need for one source of comprehensive environmental information about a given place. Under the major U.S. environmental statutes‚Äîthe Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, etc.--there was no mandate for the individual EPA programs to pool their data to create complete pictures of a facility's environmental footprint. FRS accomplishes this by matching the various program system records according to address matches into a single master record. In 1995, the Risk Management Plans were compiled with the Toxics Release Inventory Data to create the first version of the Facility Registry System. Since that time, 45 states and 25 programs have been integrated into the FRS. A new Organizational Query is offered that brings together all facilities under that Organization in one simple query result. FRS data files can also be accessed at the data.gov website.  FRS Business Rules  The FRS retrieves key identifiers from program offices. Information includes facility name, address, city, etc. The FRS also ingests any geographic information, such as latitude and longitude. The program system id number is also retrieved and placed in the FRS database. FRS also stores the SIC and NAICS codes for facilities that are collected by the various program and state collections. FRS now offers a complete query result from either a SIC value or NAICS value. FRS further contains the Corporation Name which owns or operates the facility. The information from the various programs are then parsed to remove abbreviations and colloquialisms in order to be compared using a conservative matching algorithm. Matched ids are clustered under a single FRS id, while unmatched ids are given individual ids. Geographic information is stored in a separate Location Reference Table. FRS ids that lack a latitude and longitude are sent through EPA's geocoding process, which uses rooftop and map interpolation methods to derive a latitude and longitude with the appropriate method, accuracy and description (MAD) codes.  Accessing the FRS  The FRS is available through an EPA website called the \\"Envirofacts Data Warehouse.\\" Facilities can be queried in tabular format, with active links to program databases that contain regulatory data, such as the Discharge Monitoring Report used in the water pollution permit program. FRS, through the Envirofacts site, offers a geospatial download service in various GIS file formats to allow greater access to the facility data.  Criticisms of the FRS  The role the FRS plays in EPA is to provide an accurate, authoritative facility record. The European model of environmental regulation is for facilities to be assigned a number when the plant created, and all permits are linked to that number. The U.S. environmental regulatory system is based on multiple environmental laws, with somewhat varying scope and definitions. The separate regulatory system established under each law contributes its separate set of permit information to a central data system, which has to match the facility records based on the business rules outlined above. Further complicating the issue, many programs use self-reported information, which encourages gaming the system to reduce the apparent environmental impact of a production facility. One other structural problem is that many environmental programs are delegated to the states, which further complicates facility interaction at the federal level. These structural problems prevent EPA from having as complete a picture of American pollution as its European counterparts. Another criticism of the FRS is the limited accuracy of the latitude and longitude data. While FRS has taken many new actions to improve locational values, with 2.1 million facilities which now have a latitude and longitude, it is hard to place them accurately on web maps which are not totally compatible either, such as MS-Bing and Google's Google Earth.

Although the given name was historically given to males, females named Elliot have increased from 414 in 2009 to 770 in 2013, in the United States.http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html Note, this sums the six spellings of the name given in the \\"nancy\\" reference.

The clan society usually accepts that the name originated from the town and river Elliot in Angus, Scotland. Other sources claim that the Scottish surnames (Eliott, Elliot) originate from the Ellot Scottish border-clan, from a transformation of the name Elwold. Whatever their true origin, the Scottish Elliots became notorious Border Reivers ‚Äì cattle thieves ‚Äì in the Scottish-English border area and a thorn in the side of both governments. The whole subject of the Scottish name origin is discussed by Keith Elliot Hunter on the Elliot Clan website where he argues for a Breton origin to the name and the first chief being William d'Alyth. Under that name, the d'Alyths played a key role in the Scottish Wars of Independencehttp://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/dtog/WalterdElliot3.pdf However, Mark Elliot presents a well-argued case that there is no connection between the Elliot river and town with the clan and believes the origins are in the first name of Elwald, which appears in Northumberland in the 8th century king, Elwald 1. The name has Anglo-Saxon origins and appears alongside Armstrong in Northumbrian records dating from 1165.http://www.elwald.com/wp- content/uploads/2013/06/Ellot-Water-Angus-8-23-2010.pdf The first chief is claimed to be Robert Elwold (1305‚Äì67), who came from York, but migrated to the area around Hermitage Castlehttp://gorrenberry.com/robert-elwald- migration-1305-1367/ Robert Elwold of Redheuch is granted lands around Redheuch and Larriston in the 1484 Sasine deed:File:Sasine deed 1484 for Robert Elwald (Elliot), Redheugh, Larriston, Hartsgarth.jpg Robert, 13th clan chief, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden is recorded with the surname 'Elwold'. The original Anglo-Saxon surnames from Northumbria like Aelwold, Ellwald, Elaund, Elwaird, Elwods, Alwods, Elyards, Halwads seem to have mixed together eventually as Ellot. Sir Arthur and the Dowager Lady Eliott maintained that the family were originally known as Ellots. Lady Elliot in:'The Elliots: The Story of a Border Clan' says: \\"Around 1650 someone added an \\"i\\" to our name to make it Elliot, which was without a doubt unfortunate as it confuses the clan with a well-known English Norman family called Eliot who settled in West England\\". That would exclude the idea that the Cornish Eliots set the clan up a few centuries earlier, but it is said that this was some means of expressing solidarity with John Eliot, who was regularly imprisoned by Charles I until his death in 1632. A Thomas Elyot is recorded in West Lothian, dying in 1505.https://search.ancestry.co.uk/cgi- bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=Maj1&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs;=true&qh;=X1eDmY1WLJi7iAs1jh7n7Q%3D%3D&gss;=angs-c&new;=1&rank;=1&msT;=1&gsln;=elyot&gsln;_x=0&cpxt;=1&cp;=11&MSAV;=1&uidh;=000‚â∑=CLP_WILLS&gst;=&ghc;=20&fh;=20&fsk;=BEFq368IgAAGSgAEcXw-61- Ancestry UK Wills & Probate , =Southeast England= The origin of the east English name is in Cambridgeshire. The first recorded sign of the name relates to Henry Elyot at the Priory of St Mary and St. Radegund in Cambridge in about 1180. An Elyat (or Elyot) is in Bury St. Edmunds in 1188. By 1220, Elyot is well-established in Cambridge in Great St Andrew's Parish where a William Elyot appears. A William Eliot appears in about 1270 in the same parish. The surname reaches London early in the 14th century. Johanne Eliot appears in the 1319 Portsoken (near Aldgate) Subsidy Roll of 1319 with a reference to him being found in 1311 under John Elyot. In the Museum of London is (to quote the caption) \\"a bronze jug with three feet and three bands of lettering around the neck and body. The neck is straight with a pointed spout.

A Stephen Elyot is recorded in September 1364 as a \\"vintner of Rye\\" in east Sussex and later became its MP in 1377. William Elyot was Constable of Horsham in 1401CPR, 1399-1401, p. 458 and his grandson, Thomas Elyot (1420‚Äì67) a Filacer (issuer of the Royal Writs) is buried at Wonersh church in Surrey, not far north of Horsham. It is from him that the Elliots of Godalming descend with their arms being Azure with a fess or (blue with a gold strip across the centre). The Surrey Elyots changed to Eliott in about 1500 and then changed to Elliott during the 1700s (see Elliott v Davenport 1705, a famous legal case about Wills brought by the main family) and settled on it by the end of the 18th century. It is not made easier by a member of the clan Eliott Stobs family, George Augustus Eliott, (1717‚Äì1790), the defender of Gibraltar, being made 1st Baron Heathfield, which is in Sussex, although he died childless. =Southwest England= Eliot family of St. Germans coat of arms The name in the West Country derives from the Eliot family (South England) of Cornwall at Port Eliot/St. Germans, who claim descent from a Norman knight, Sir William de Aliot. It is unknown exactly when the Eliots settled in Devon, but it is estimated they prospered there for 8 to 10 generations before moving to St. Germans. The earliest record is of a William Elyot, who appears in the Somerset Assizes rolls in 1257 and there is a record of the surname in an indenture signed in 1400 by RYC Elyot. =France= The name Eliot appears in Normandy in 1195 and a son of Anschar Elyot in 1198. It has been argued by Keith Elliott Hunter that the origins of the St. Germans Eliot family were among the Bretons accompanying William the Conqueror, who were originally rewarded with lands in Devon. The Breton origin of Eliot and Elliot is indicated by these names being in significant clusters in Morbihan, southern Brittany. Soon after victory at the Battle of Hastings Elliots, under Count Brien of Penthievre (Morbihan), were despatched to the West Country. Other Eliots were sent later to Monmouthshire in South Wales and to the marcher counties, where significant clusters of the name can be found today. Bretons also settled in the north, as vassals of the Breton Earl of Richmond, Alan of Penthievre. Large surviving clusters of Eliots in Normandy (Seine Maritime) today could be due to later grants of land. The Alliots, found also in Southern Brittany and the Loire Atlantique, had lands in the modern French departement of Aisne. One variant in Scotland was Dalliot (or, more likely, d'Alliot) and a variation from the Breton original name Ellegouet, from which the Scots variant Elligott is derived, is to be found in clusters in Finistere. Elot is also a Breton name variant. =Northern Ireland= Robert Bell in The Book of Scots-Irish Family Names adds: \\"For double L and double T, / the Scots should look across the sea!\\" He pointed out that 71 of 76 births of children by that name in Ireland in 1890 spelt it \\"Elliott\\". Elliot(t)s emigrated or were sent to north Ireland in the early 17th century after the Border area was pacified, following the union of the English and Scottish crowns in 1603. Many settled in county Fermanagh. =DNA= The Elliot Clan Society has an extensive list of DNA results which point to native Celtic origins for the clan. However, the three contributions from Sussex do suggest both a native origin in the area and the unusual J haplotype from southern Europe. There are also suggestions of French DNA from the Surrey Elliotts. Surname myths Some sources claim it may be derived from a French form of Elias, which is itself derived from the biblical name \\"Elijah\\". Legend also has it that the extra \\"t\\" in Eliott arose when a branch of the Eliotts adopted Christianity. It is claimed that the surname originated in the early 13th century as \\"Eliot\\", as there is supposed to be a reference to \\"Geoffrey Eliot\\", Abbot of Hyde, in documents linked to the creation of Magna Carta. However, the Abbot of Hyde Abbey (near Winchester in Hampshire), who signed the 1224 version was Abbot Astonhttp://www.hyde900.org.uk/hydeabbey/history-of-new-minster-and-hyde- abbey/ and the 1297 version confirmed by Edward I mentions the Abbot of Hyde as a witness, but does not name him. There are also records in the Domesday Book of the name spelled \\"Ailiet\\", thought to originate from an old English name \\"√Ü√æelgeat\\" (meaning \\"noble gate\\") and leading to the English and Scottish given name spelled \\"Elyat\\". Extent of the surname In England, the surname Elliott is well represented in Northumberland, County Durham, Derbyshire, Lancashire and Yorkshire, and in the south, in Surrey, Sussex, London, Cambridgeshire and Cornwall. In Scotland, the surname is well represented in Lanarkshire, Angus, Roxburghshire, Dumfriesshire, and other border counties. In the United States the surname is well represented in Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Alabama, New Hampshire and Delaware. Famous bearers of the surname Among the many famous people with this name are the authors T. S. Eliot and George Eliot (pseudonym of Mary Ann Evans).

The property of bounded generation is also closely related with the congruence subgroup problem (see ).  Definitions  A group G is called boundedly generated if there exists a finite subset S of G and a positive integer m such that every element g of G can be represented as a product of at most m powers of the elements of S: : g = s_1^{k_1} \\\\cdots s_m^{k_m}, where s_i \\\\in S and k_i are integers. The finite set S generates G, so a boundedly generated group is finitely generated. An equivalent definition can be given in terms of cyclic subgroups. A group G is called boundedly generated if there is a finite family C1, ‚Ä¶, CM of not necessarily distinct cyclic subgroups such that G = C1‚Ä¶CM as a set.  Properties  * Bounded generation is unaffected by passing to a subgroup of finite index: if H is a finite index subgroup of G then G is boundedly generated if and only if H is boundedly generated. * Any quotient group of a boundedly generated group is also boundedly generated. * A finitely generated torsion group must be finite if it is boundedly generated; equivalently, an infinite finitely generated torsion group is not boundedly generated. A pseudocharacter on a discrete group G is defined to be a real-valued function f on a G such that : f(gh) ‚àí f(g) ‚àí f(h) is uniformly bounded and f(gn) = n¬∑f(g). * The vector space of pseudocharacters of a boundedly generated group G is finite-dimensional.  Examples  * If n ‚â• 3, the group SLn(Z) is boundedly generated by its elementary subgroups, formed by matrices differing from the identity matrix only in one off-diagonal entry. In 1984, Carter and Keller gave an elementary proof of this result, motivated by a question in algebraic K-theory. * A free group on at least two generators is not boundedly generated (see below). * The group SL2(Z) is not boundedly generated, since it contains a free subgroup with two generators of index 12. * A Gromov- hyperbolic group is boundedly generated if and only if it is virtually cyclic (or elementary), i.e. contains a cyclic subgroup of finite index.  Free groups are not boundedly generated  Several authors have stated in the mathematical literature that it is obvious that finitely generated free groups are not boundedly generated. This section contains various obvious and less obvious ways of proving this. Some of the methods, which touch on bounded cohomology, are important because they are geometric rather than algebraic, so can be applied to a wider class of groups, for example Gromov-hyperbolic groups. Since for any n ‚â• 2, the free group on 2 generators F2 contains the free group on n generators Fn as a subgroup of finite index (in fact n ‚Äì 1), once one non-cyclic free group on finitely many generators is known to be not boundedly generated, this will be true for all of them. Similarly, since SL2(Z) contains F2 as a subgroup of index 12, it is enough to consider SL2(Z). In other words, to show that no Fn with n ‚â• 2 has bounded generation, it is sufficient to prove this for one of them or even just for SL2(Z) . =Burnside couterexamples= Since bounded generation is preserved under taking homomorphic images, if a single finitely generated group with at least two generators is known to be not boundedly generated, this will be true for the free group on the same number of generators, and hence for all free groups. To show that no (non-cyclic) free group has bounded generation, it is therefore enough to produce one example of a finitely generated group which is not boundedly generated, and any finitely generated infinite torsion group will work. The existence of such groups constitutes Golod and Shafarevich's negative solution of the generalized Burnside problem in 1964; later, other explicit examples of infinite finitely generated torsion groups were constructed by Aleshin, Olshanskii, and Grigorchuk, using automata. Consequently, free groups of rank at least two are not boundedly generated. =Symmetric groups= The symmetric group Sn can be generated by two elements, a 2-cycle and an n-cycle, so that it is a quotient group of F2. On the other hand, it is easy to show that the maximal order M(n) of an element in Sn satisfies : log M(n) ‚â§ n/e (Edmund Landau proved the more precise asymptotic estimate log M(n) ~ (n log n)1/2). In fact if the cycles in a cycle decomposition of a permutation have length N1, ..., Nk with N1 \\\\+ ¬∑¬∑¬∑ + Nk = n, then the order of the permutation divides the product N1 ¬∑¬∑¬∑Nk, which in turn is bounded by (n/k)k, using the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means. On the other hand, (n/x)x is maximized when x=e. If F2 could be written as a product of m cyclic subgroups, then necessarily n! would have to be less than or equal to M(n)m for all n, contradicting Stirling's asymptotic formula. =Hyperbolic geometry= There is also a simple geometric proof that G = SL2(Z) is not boundedly generated. It acts by M√∂bius transformations on the upper half-plane H, with the Poincar√© metric. Any compactly supported 1-form Œ± on a fundamental domain of G extends uniquely to a G-invariant 1-form on H. If z is in H and Œ≥ is the geodesic from z to g(z), the function defined by : F(g)\\\\equiv F_{\\\\alpha,z}(g)=\\\\int_{\\\\gamma}\\\\, \\\\alpha satisfies the first condition for a pseudocharacter since by the Stokes theorem : F(gh) - F(g)-F(h) = \\\\int_{\\\\Delta}\\\\, d\\\\alpha, where Œî is the geodesic triangle with vertices z, g(z) and h‚àí1(z), and geodesics triangles have area bounded by œÄ. The homogenized function :f_\\\\alpha(g) = \\\\lim_{n\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} F_{\\\\alpha,z}(g^n)/n defines a pseudocharacter, depending only on Œ±. As is well known from the theory of dynamical systems, any orbit (gk(z)) of a hyperbolic element g has limit set consisting of two fixed points on the extended real axis; it follows that the geodesic segment from z to g(z) cuts through only finitely many translates of the fundamental domain. It is therefore easy to choose Œ± so that fŒ± equals one on a given hyperbolic element and vanishes on a finite set of other hyperbolic elements with distinct fixed points. Since G therefore has an infinite-dimensional space of pseudocharacters, it cannot be boundedly generated. Dynamical properties of hyperbolic elements can similarly be used to prove that any non-elementary Gromov-hyperbolic group is not boundedly generated. =Brooks pseudocharacters= Robert Brooks gave a combinatorial scheme to produce pseudocharacters of any free group Fn; this scheme was later shown to yield an infinite-dimensional family of pseudocharacters (see ). Epstein and Fujiwara later extended these results to all non-elementary Gromov-hyperbolic groups. =Gromov boundary= This simple folklore proof uses dynamical properties of the action of hyperbolic elements on the Gromov boundary of a Gromov-hyperbolic group. For the special case of the free group Fn, the boundary (or space of ends) can be identified with the space X of semi-infinite reduced words :g1 g2 ¬∑¬∑¬∑ in the generators and their inverses. It gives a natural compactification of the tree, given by the Cayley graph with respect to the generators. A sequence of semi-infinite words converges to another such word provided that the initial segments agree after a certain stage, so that X is compact (and metrizable). The free group acts by left multiplication on the semi-infinite words. Moreover, any element g in Fn has exactly two fixed points g¬±‚àû, namely the reduced infinite words given by the limits of gn as n tends to ¬±‚àû. Furthermore, gn¬∑w tends to g¬±‚àû as n tends to ¬±‚àû for any semi-infinite word w; and more generally if wn tends to w‚â† g ¬±‚àû, then gn¬∑wn tends to g+‚àû as n tends to ‚àû. If Fn were boundedly generated, it could be written as a product of cyclic groups Ci generated by elements hi. Let X0 be the countable subset given by the finitely many Fn-orbits of the fixed points hi ¬±‚àû, the fixed points of the hi and all their conjugates. Since X is uncountable, there is an element of g with fixed points outside X0 and a point w outside X0 different from these fixed points. Then for some subsequence (gm) of (gn) :gm = h1n(m,1) ¬∑¬∑¬∑ hkn(m,k), with each n(m,i) constant or strictly monotone. On the one hand, by successive use of the rules for computing limits of the form hn¬∑wn, the limit of the right hand side applied to x is necessarily a fixed point of one of the conjugates of the hi's. On the other hand, this limit also must be g+‚àû, which is not one of these points, a contradiction.

In addition, Eyre is a Professor Emeritus of painting and drawing at the University of Manitoba where he taught for 33 years, from 1959 until his retirement in 1992. He has been described as a \\"visual philosopher\\" and \\"a true outsider and visionary\\". Ivan Eyre's paintings and drawings have been exhibited internationally and are featured in numerous galleries across Canada. His sculptures are prominently displayed at Assiniboine Park and the McMichael sculpture garden in Kleinburg, Ontario.  Biography  Ivan Eyre was born to Thomas and Katie Eyre in Tullymet, Saskatchewan in 1935. Eyre began school at the age of five, during which time his family relocated twice: first to Southey in 1940, then again to Ituna in 1941. Shortly thereafter, Katie and her three children left their rural environment and moved to urban Saskatoon while Thomas Eyre worked abroad as an Air Force electrician. Eyre developed an artistic interest at an early age. At the age of 15, while still a high school student, he began taking after-school art lessons at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate where he studied under Ernest Lindner for the duration of 1950‚Äì1953. According to Eyre: \\"Knowing that there was somebody seriously committed to art, somebody who had made it his life's work, was encouraging. [Lindner's] influence in this regard was important.\\" Eyre went on to attend evening classes at the University of Saskatchewan which were taught by Eli Bornstein in his final year of high school. In 1953, Eyre moved to Winnipeg where he attended the University of Manitoba School of Art, graduating in 1957 with a BA in fine arts. In his autobiography, Eyre reminisces about the tutelage of his professors and class trips to the Chicago Art Institute. He was a pupil of artists Wynona Mulcaster and George Swinton. During his schooling as an undergraduate, Eyre exhibited several works at the Winnipeg Art Gallery, winning the attention and support of then gallery director, Ferdinand Eckhardt. Eyre received the Winnipeg Art Gallery Scholarship for his achievements in 1956. Around the time of his graduation, he married Brenda Yvonne Fenske, a peer student at the university. Eyre continued on to the University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, in 1958‚Äì59 as a master's candidate where he both studied and taught as a graduate assistant. He completed several sculptural projects, among them his \\"first wooden head\\" which is currently stored in a private collection in Ottawa. The American art scene was in full swing and Eyre's paintings became open to influences from such artists like Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Joan Mir√≥, and Max Beckmann. = Professorship = Due to financial difficulties, Eyre and his wife returned to Winnipeg in 1959 where he was hired on a part-time basis by the University of Manitoba's School of Art. For one year, Eyre taught painting and drawing to students in Brandon and Neepawa as part of the university's extension course program. In 1960, Eyre became a full-time instructor, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1992. Eyre began developing his individualistic style during this period. Eyre remembers that around 1960‚Äì1962, \\"I began to reevaluate my work and decided to begin afresh....I worked at ridding myself of all influences.\\" In 1966, the Canada Council provided Eyre with a Canada Council Senior Arts Grant which allowed him and his family to spend a year and four months in Europe. Upon his return, Eyre wrote a report for the Canada Council of his experiences, criticizing \\"what was, for the most part, being hailed in the major centres as 'breakthroughs' in paintings.\\" At Eckhardt's recommendation, Eyre's work was selected for an exhibition at the Frankfurter Kunstkabinett in 1973 and entered the German art world with great success.  Work  Ivan Eyre, Swallows (1994) Working primarily in oil and acrylic mediums, Eyre's figurative paintings and still lifes tend to be spatially complex, his landscapes large and panoramic. Canadian art historian Joan Murray commented on the expressiveness of Eyre's work, noting that Eyre's corpus reflects the artist's imagination, memories, and perceptions of the world. Eyre's subjects and approaches are versatile and prone to mutability. Murray also claimed that Eyre's art \\"has, to a degree unusual in Canadian art: a pervading sense of stillness and calm.\\" James D. Campbell remarked on Eyre's \\"existential sensibility\\" by pointing to the dark and violent undercurrents in Eyre's thematic reinterpretations of the world. Eyre rejects the notion of \\"schools\\" or \\"movements\\", whether coined as such by art historians or artists. Prioritizing the concept of artist-as-individual-creator above all else, Eyre has criticized movements such as the avant garde for restricting the creative capabilities of artists who fall under their umbrella and binding their adherents to a specific style or direction. In 1974, the Winnipeg Art Gallery purchased Eyre's 1973 painting Tanglewood for a record-breaking price never before paid for the work of a Manitoba artist. Today, a typical Eyre painting has an auction value of approximately $30,000 to upwards of $300,000.  Ivan Eyre Gallery  The third floor of the Assiniboine Park pavilion museum in Winnipeg, Manitoba is named for Ivan Eyre who is one of several Manitoban artists (including Walter J. Phillips and Clarence Tillenius) honoured and exhibited at the pavilion. The WAG @ The Park initiative launched in fall of 2016 upon completion of renovations due to moisture and roof leaks. In collaboration with the Assiniboine conservancy, the Winnipeg Art Gallery agreed to curate free exhibitions in the revamped space using only works by Eyre, Phillips, and Tillenius. The Assiniboine Park conservancy houses Canada's largest collection of Eyre's art, made possible by Eyre's donation of 200 paintings, 5000 drawings, and 16 sculptures to the park.

Controversies In August 2008, the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control (‚ÄúCT-DPUC‚Äù) began an investigation of MXenergy that was later joined by the office of Richard Blumenthal, the then Connecticut Attorney General, and Connecticut Office of Consumer Counsel. The investigation followed complaints from customers who complained of high bills following the run-up of international energy prices in the spring of 2008. MXenergy customers who had enrolled in fixed prices for a four-month period in the spring found their prices jumped to higher monthly variable prices in June 2008. After a lengthy investigation, the CT-DPUC issued a report that found among other things that the company had \\"massively overcharged\\" customers, and had given 30 days and not 45 days notice of price changes as required by state regulation. The CT-DPUC did not find any evidence of intentional customer protection violations. The CT-DPUC acknowledged that the company had voluntarily brought the matter to the regulators‚Äô attention after it learned that it had inadvertently neglected to send out price change notices in a timely manner and that the company had voluntarily offered to extend its fixed prices, and agreed in a settlement to credit or refund $2.1 million to affected customers. Environmental record The company is a member of the Chicago Climate Exchange and is an Energy Star Partner placing a strong focus on environmental and sustainability issues. The company currently offers 100% renewable energy to its Connecticut customers. MXenergy offers carbon offset credits to its customers as a way to neutralize their carbon footprint. The credits support new forestry in Columbus, Georgia. The company is partnered with Valley Wood, Inc., a certified offset aggregator for the Chicago Climate Exchange. =Community service= MXenergy has sponsored two coat drives in 2010. The first was in January in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Teaming up with WAEB 790 AM, WMHX 106.7 FM, and WODE 99.9 FM The HAWK, warm clothing and food were collected for The Rescue Mission, Jewish Family Service Food Bank, Kosher Food Pantry, and The Salvation Army in Allentown, as well as the Volunteers of American in Mechanicsburg. MXenergy also teamed up with 95.9 FM The Fox for a coat drive in Norwalk, Connecticut. The drive was meant to raise warm clothing and food for the Norwalk Emergency Center, but so many donations were received that a sizable donation was also made to the Community Closet in Bridgeport. In 2009, James Boncek of Fairfield, Connecticut began converting a $100 1993 Toyota Tercel from gasoline to battery power. With significant financial backing from MXenergy, this goal was achieved after 100 hours of research and 100 hours of labor. The car currently gets 50 miles per charge off its 12 batteries and can be plugged into any wall plug. Boncek currently speaks at schools about environmental sustainability.

Early life Milan Aƒáimoviƒá was born on 31 May 1898 in Pinosava, in the Belgrade municipality of Vo≈ædovac. He finished gymnasium in Belgrade and received a law degree from the University of Belgrade in 1923. On 2 September 1935, he and Velibor Joniƒá successfully petitioned the Ministry of Interior to legalize the Yugoslav National Movement (Zbor). He became the chief of police in Belgrade in 1938 and was appointed Minister of Interior by Milan Stojadinoviƒá on 21 December 1938. He held this position until 5 February 1939. In April 1939, he was arrested alongside Stojadinoviƒá and was detained until August 1940.  World War II  On 30 May 1941, a few weeks after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, Aƒáimoviƒá formed the first puppet government in Serbia, called the Commissioner Government. He was the leader of the government until 29 August of that year when it was dissolved. Aƒáimoviƒá's puppet government was replaced by another puppet government, the Government of National Salvation, headed by former general Milan Nediƒá. In this government, Aƒáimoviƒá served as minister of the interior. He was sympathetic toward the Chetniks of Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá and maintained close contact with Mihailoviƒá. The Germans suspected that Aƒáimoviƒá warned Mihailoviƒá of the launching of Operation Mihailovic, which was conducted over 6‚Äì7 December 1941. The warning, apparently given the day before the offensive began, enabled Mihailoviƒá to escape. In January 1942, he visited Serbian prisoners in the Osnabr√ºck concentration camp in Nazi Germany. Despite these actions and the Germans‚Äô suspicions, Aƒáimoviƒá managed to stay on good terms with them, even meeting with Mihailoviƒá in March 1942 with German permission. On 10 November 1942, Aƒáimoviƒá was replaced as minister of interior by Colonel Tanasije Diniƒá, who was seen as more anti-Mihailoviƒá. After his replacement and the expulsion of the Germans from Serbia in October 1944, Aƒáimoviƒá acted as liaison between Mihailoviƒá and German Envoy Hermann Neubacher in Vienna. After the German administration in Serbia fell, Aƒáimoviƒá joined a Chetnik column. He was killed by Yugoslav Partisans at the Battle of Zelengora in May 1945.

He entered the mercantile trade in Pittsburgh in the firm of Riddle and Forsyth, and subsequently engaged in the banking business in Philadelphia. In 1837, he became editor of the Advocate, a Whig newspaper in Pittsburgh. He served as the city's postmaster from 1841 to 1845. When his term of office expired, he took over the paper called the Spirit of the Age, and renamed it the Commercial Journal. He was connected to the paper as editor and proprietor until failing health near the end of his life forced him to retire from it. While at the helm of the Journal, Riddle was elected on the Whig ticket as Mayor of Pittsburgh. He was not renominated at the end of his single-year term. With the Whigs in steep decline, he moved to the American (Know Nothing) Party, and was active in pushing an anti-slavery agenda within that organization. He ended up a Republican.

Marbling ceramic techniques were used in Egypt and China and through the Romans to the West. Early ceramics in the Stoke-on-Trent use more than one colour of clay for decorative effect. In England this was referred to as agateware. In Japan there are a few pieces from the Momoyama period, and Edo period, as well as Mingei and there was an explosion of it from about 1978‚Äì1995 due probably to Aida Yusuke's advertising and to Matsui Kousei who refers to his work as neriage. The term started being used in the 1970s to describe related kanji neriage. Yusuke Aida was on a television commercial for Nescaf√© and it seems to have entered the vocabulary at about that time when his nerikomi coffee cups were available to the first people contacting the advertisers. It was used in the Tang Dynasty in 7th century China there are at least two Chinese characters to describe variations of this technique (one surface, one structural).http://gingerbreadsquaregallery.com/ArtGlass/Thivo/Thivo- bio/thivo- bio.htmlhttp://iweb.tntech.edu/wpitelka/gallery/techniques/techniques.htm Technique Slabs of different clays or clays colored with stains or oxides, are stacked, folded, pressed into logs, sliced, and arranged to form a vessel.

HLA-DPB belongs to the HLA class II beta chain paralogues. This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha (DPA) and a beta chain (DPB), both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). The beta chain is approximately 26-28 kDa and its gene contains 6 exons.

It powered six watermills. The stream may have formerly been known as the Bradbourne, Bradbourne Lane in Ditton bearing witness to this name. Watermills The Domesday Book recorded two mills worth 10/- at Metlinge (East Malling). In 1363 there were two mills in the village. East Malling possessed a fulling mill from 1567 to 1719, most likely to have been Middle Mill. Thomas Tomlyn was a miller in the 17th century, Thomas Pidgeon, corn miller of East Malling died in 1685, In 1706 there were three mills - Upper, Weir and Middle Mills. The history of the paper mills needs to be read together, as they were all linked through various owners. =Upper Mill, East Malling.= TQ 697 571 James Brooks was the at the mill in 1752, when the mill was rated at ¬£61, increasing to ¬£122 in 1757. By 1764 the mill was operating as a paper mill, James Brooks insuring the mill for ¬£150 in that year. One of his apprentices was Nicholas Tapsfield, who was later to work at the paper mill at Sundridge. In 1801 he insured the mill for ¬£350 and died in 1805 aged 69. John Larking took the mill 1n 1806, it being then rated at ¬£131. Larking went into partnership with John Morrice by 1816 and Morrice was recorded as being at the mill from 1817-21. He was succeeded by William Blunden, who was working at Upper Mill in 1819, followed by Robert Tassell c.1823. The mill underwent considerable development between 1840 and 1860. It was demolished in the years between the First and Second World Wars. An illustration of Upper Mill can be seen here. The mill pond was some long, and covered an area of just over ¬Ω acre in 1840. The mill had an overshot waterwheel of some diameter and wide, the remains of which were on site in 1972. The tail race discharged into the mill pond of Weir Mill.Rootsweb =Weir Mill, East Malling.= The converted mill TQ 698 572 Probably one of the two Domesday mills. The mill was marked on a map of 1706. The next known mention of Weir Mill was in 1810 when the mill was marked on the map accompanying the enclosure award. In 1840 James Phillips was the owner- occupier of the mill, which was a water corn mill with waterwheel driving two pairs of stones. The pond of Weir Mill is roughly square in shape and covers an area of just over ¬º acre. The mill passed from James to Thomas Phillips c.1855 and to Mr. T J Dewe c,1893. G E Hide was working the mill in 1905 and S R Anscombe bought the mill in 1913. The mill last ground corn in 1930 and was bought by Whitbread Ltd., the Maidstone brewers, who used part of the mill to store hops. The mill subsequently passed into the ownership of Wm. Lillico & Son and was then used as a general store. During this time the timber part of the mill buildings were becoming derelict. ;The surviving mill building The timber clad original mill building dates from the reign of Queen Anne. A brick extension was added in two stages, the last part being built in 1889. Roller mills of 4¬Ω sack capacity were installed c.1893 as was a boiler and steam engine, principally to drive the roller mills whilst the waterwheel drove the stones. The steam engine was a beam engine, it was eventually sold to a buyer in the USA. ;The wooden mill This is four storeys in height, the base being of brick and the upper storeys timber. The diameter waterwheel was overshot with eighty buckets and carried on a diameter cast iron axle. The wooden upright shaft was only diameter, reducing to at first floor level. It carried a Great Spur Wheel and an iron Crown Wheel of diameter. This received a drive from the steam engine so that the mill could be driven that way if necessary. The mill drove three pairs of millstones. ;The brick mill This was built in two parts, latterly known as the \\"middle room\\" and the \\"end room\\", this last part being built in 1889. The mill was some six storeys in height, dwarfing the original mill. The middle room contained the roller mills, six in total. =Middle Mill, East Malling.= TQ 696 574 Probably one of the two Domesday mills. Middle Mill was in existence in 1684 when the pond was shown on a map drawn by Abraham Walter. In 1755 Richard Gowlett was the papermaker here, and in that year he took John Evernden and Elizabeth Sands as apprentices. He insured the mill for ¬£35 in 1770 and he died c.1778, his widow Mary paying the rates on the mill until 1798 when the mill was sold to George Blunden. William Blunden was at the mill in 1816, but George Blunden was again recorded at the mill in 1824. He was recorded at a manufacturer of brown and white paper in 1832 and Francis Collins joined him in partnership that year. Robert Tassell acquired the mill c.1833 and went into partnership with Henry Smith in 1838. In 1841 there was an increase in the rateable value of the property from ¬£54 to ¬£150. The partnership was dissolved in 1848, all three mills being in the sole ownership of Robert Tassell from 1834 to 1838. The mill stood empty from 1848 to 1850, when the Busbridge brothers took over the running of the mills. They were involved in a Court case in 1859 over the discharge of foul water used in the paper making process. The mill pond covered an area of just over one-half acre. An illustration of Middle Mill can be seen here.BAPH =Lower Mill, East Malling.= TQ 697 576 In 1792 Clement and George Taylor were granted a patent for the use of chlorine for bleaching rags for use in paper manufacture. James Whatman claimed that he was able to prove that several trials had already been made, including by Mr. Larking, who owned Lower Mill at that time. In 1816, John Larking and John Morrice were in partnership at both Upper and Lower Mills, the partnership being dissolved on 8 October of that year, John Morrice taking both mills. Robert Tassell took both mills by 1821, making both brown and white papers. He went into partnership with Henry Smith in 1838 and by 1844 they owned all three paper mills. This partnership was dissolved c.1844 and Henry Smith was the sole occupier of the three mills, worth together ¬£420. In 1848 Lower Mill was recorded as empty and valued at ¬£120. All three mills were managed by Thomas Harris Busbridge and George Frederick Busbridge from c.1849. It is likely that Lower Mill ceased regular production of paper in 1848, being used spasmodically until 1851, and closing completely by 1852. The mill seems to have been demolished by 1860, not appearing on the first 25 inch Ordnance Survey map. The mill pond is some long and wide, covering an area of just under 1¬Ω acres (6,100 m¬≤). =Church Mills, Ditton.= TQ 709 582 A Domesday site, one mill was recorded at Dictvne (Ditton) with a value of 10/-. Tenants of this corn mill include Edward Smith in 1724, J Whiteing from 1725‚Äì43, Thomas Shepard 1744-54, his widow in 1755-6, William Luck in 1757. Thomas Allchin was at the mill in 1840 and was still there in 1852. Joseph Jellis was the miller in 1887-90 and Robert Foster was the last known miller in 1905. The mill closed down c.1912. The mill is located close to the ford in Bradbourne Lane. In its later years the waterwheel was replaced by a turbine. =Mill Hall Mill, Aylesford.= TQ 715 589 This mill was marked on a map of 1684, it was a paper mill at that time. In 1695 Edward Middleton was working the mill, which then had a rateable value of ¬£20. He was at the mill until 1724 when William Harris took it over. William Harris died in 1741 and his widow ran the mill until 1744 when Thomas Harris took it over. He was still at the mill in 1763 when he insured the mill for ¬£100. in 1776 Thomas Golding insured the mill. He was still at the mill in 1803 but by 1812 his son Stephen Golding was recorded as a master paper maker of Ditton when he married. There was a partnership between Thomas Golding and his sons Stephen and Thomas jr which was dissolved in 1816. The artist Jean Claude Natteas (1785‚Äì1822) sketched the mill in 1816.Artfund In 1832, Robert Tassell took over the mill and it ceased to make paper by 1841. In 1841, Stephen Spratt was recorded as the occupier of the mill, by then a corn mill. he was at the mill until at least 1862. In the 1871 census the miller was Henry Stonham who lived there with his wife Rebecca and brother Charles, also a miller. However, in the 1881 census brother Charles is shown as the miller living there with his wife and family. In 1878 the owner is still Charles Stoham and sons. A steam engine was recorded at the mill in 1887, but had gone by 1890, when Walter Skinner was the miller, still there in 1895. Henry Packham was the last miller, there at least 1905-13, but the mill had stopped working by 1922. The machinery was removed and the building converted into stables by A E Reed & Co. Ltd. the mill was demolished c.1950 but the waterwheel survived until 1969. The mill was of three storeys, the base being of ragstone and the upper storeys of timber, clad in tarred weatherboarding. The overshot waterwheel was diameter and wide, mounted on a square iron axle, driving an iron pit wheel. The iron pentrough was dated 1887. The final remains of Mill Hall Mill were demolished to make way for the foundations of a footbridge over the M20. Ford TQ 708 579 The ford As mentioned under Church Mills, there is a ford on Bradbourne Lane. In recent years Kent County Council have attempted to close the road through the ford without going through the correct legal channels. References See also Medway watermills article.

If a buyer does not pay, the trade credit insurance policy will pay out a percentage of the outstanding debt. This percentage usually ranges from 75% to 95% of the invoice amount, but may be higher or lower depending on the type of cover that was purchased. Surety and bonds * Surety bonds guarantee the performance of obligations, from construction or service contracts, to licensing, to commercial undertakings. The surety guarantees to pay the direct loss suffered by one party (generally employer or beneficiary) as a result of a contractual default by the other party (generally known as the contractor). For example, the failure of a contractor to complete a contract in accordance with its terms and specifications or the failure of an enterprise to pay taxes or customs duties to a government or department. Members' main lines of surety business are: * Customs, tax and/or similar bonds * Bonds concerning concessions and licenses * Judicial Bonds * Bonds concerning purchases of goods and/or services * Bonds concerning leases * Bonds concerning construction and/or supply contracts * Financial bonds * Other bonds Reinsurance * A reinsurance company insures the risk that has been underwritten by an insurance company. The risk of a major loss event imposes a burden that no single company can bear. Reinsurance makes it possible for these risks to be underwritten. In a way, one could say, \\"reinsurance is insurance for insurance companies\\". Over the years the international reinsurance sector has developed into a highly specialised financial services industry that works closely in conjunction with direct insurers to meet the needs of their cursomers. ICISA's Reinsurance Members have departments focusing only on the reinsurance of credit insurance and surety risks. History ICISA was established as (ICIA) (International Credit Insurance Association) in 1928.

But we find that the tonality is actually the relative major of the key implied by the tune, and the harmonies consist of the tonic (with a free-floating sixth) and dominant ninth.

A member of the Amilakhvari, one of the leading noble families of Georgia, he was involved in, along with his father, a 1765 coup plot aimed at deposing Erekle II in favour of Prince Paata, a pretender to the Georgian throne. After the plot collapsed, he was arrested and mutilated (his nose was cut). In 1771, however, he escaped from prison and fled to the Russian Empire where he joined Prince Alexander, another Georgian pretender-in-exile. With the Russo-Georgian rapprochement, Amilakhvari was arrested in 1783 by the Russian Government at Erekle‚Äôs request and held in the Vyborg prison. The 1801 amnesty resulted in Amilakhvari being granted his freedom and he was allowed to return to Georgia. However, he died while making his way back to Astrakhan.

Background He was owned and bred by American George W. Strawbridge Jr., an avid ice hockey fan and a shareholder and Director of the National Hockey League's Buffalo Sabres who named the foal for the Finnish player, Esa Tikkanen. From a family involved in steeplechase and flat racing, George W. Strawbridge Jr. maintained racing stables in France and the United States. Tikkanen was sent into training with Chantilly-based trainer Jonathan Pease. Racing career Tikkanen raced twice at age two earning a win plus a third-place finish in the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. At age three, he won the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe, then run at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris where he also ran third in the Group 1 Prix Lupin and fourth in the Prix du Jockey Club. In 1994, Tikkanen also competed in Ireland, Italy, and in Germany where he earned his best result with a third-place finish in the Group 3 F√ºrstenberg-Rennen at Baden-Baden. Sent to the United States in the fall, under jockey Cash Asmussen, who had ridden the colt in France, Tikkanen won the Grade I Turf Classic Invitational at Belmont Park. Despite this important win, in the ensuing Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs he was sent off as a 16-1 longshot. Tikkanen was up against one of the strongest international fields in the race's history which included the heavy betting favorite Paradise Creek as well as top runners such as Fraise, Hatoof, Hernando, Volochine, Raintrap plus Celtic Arms who had won that year's Prix du Jockey Club and Prix Lupin and had defeated Tikkanen in both races. Ridden by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey Mike Smith, in the homestretch Tikkanen overtook the front-running Paradise Creek and won the 1¬Ω mile race in track record time. Racing in 1995 at age four, Tikkanen made seven starts with his best performance a second-place finish in the Group 2 Jockey Club Stakes at England's Newmarket Racecourse. Stud career Retired to stud duty, he has stood at Glebe House Stud in Ireland and as of 2007 stands at Wood Farm Stud near Telford, Shropshire in England. To date, his progeny have met with modest success.

It is also a parish church in the Diocese of Des Moines. The church building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Bishop Henry Cosgrove of the Diocese of Davenport established St. John's Parish in 1905. Its territory had been taken from St. Ambrose Parish. On June 7, of that year fourteen lots were purchased on University Avenue for about $8,000 by the Rev. Daniel F. Mulvihil, the parish's first pastor. Two more lots were bought for $1,375 on July 20. These purchases marked the beginning of St. John's parish. The school was the first building built by the parish. A chapel on the second floor served the parish as its church. The first Mass was celebrated on Christmas Day in 1905. Between 1907 and 1918 the school included both primary and secondary programs. The Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary taught in the school. The high school program was discontinued when citywide Catholic high schools for boys and girls opened. In 1911 the parish became a part of the newly established Diocese of Des Moines. A brick rectory was built c. 1912 to the west of the school. The parish was incorporated on December 16, 1912. with In August 1913 the basement of the present church was completed and the parish used it for its church until the upper church was completed. It was part of the designs for a new church by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot, Bird & Rawson. The rest of that church design was not built. The architects who designed the present church were from Maginnis & Walsh of Boston. They were also responsible for the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C. The parish priest at St. John's, the Rev. Martin S. McNamara, was also influential in the design especially in having it based on Maginnis & Walsh's design for St. Catherine's Church in Somerville, Massachusetts (c. 1915) as well as the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls in Rome (rebuilt 1823). McNamara had previously been responsible for the design and construction of All Saints Church in Stuart, Iowa, another Maginnis & Walsh project. The local architect chosen to supervise the project was John Normile. Charles W. Wietz' Sons was the contractor who built the church building. The cornerstone for the present church was laid on September 19, 1926. The footprint of the present church extends several feet beyond that of the 1913 basement. Initially, the exterior of the church was designed to be brick because Maginnis & Walsh thought limestone was too expensive, but Father McNamara insisted he could raise the necessary funds and he did. The church was built for $480,000. The finished church was dedicated by Bishop Thomas W. Drumm on December 4, 1927. Two other Catholic bishops and over one hundred priests from the Des Moines diocese and elsewhere attended the dedication. The baldachin and high altar, designed by Maginnis & Walsh, were added in 1929. The building was also designed to have a 500-seat chapel built off to the east of the altar area, but it has never been built. The first of the church's stained glass windows was installed in 1947, and the rest were installed by 1953. The widows were delayed because of the financial constraints related to the Great Depression and World War II. Conrad Pickel Studio of Waukesha, Wisconsin designed the church's 10 nave windows and the 36 clerestory windows. The church suffered water damage in fires on February 18, 1961 and February 6, 1970, but they did not cause any serious damage. A new convent was built across the street to the west of the church. A temporary free-standing altar was set up for the priest to face the people in 1964. The first vernacular Mass in Des Moines was celebrated at St. John's by Msgr. Edward Pfeffer, the chancellor of the diocese. The present altar used for liturgy was consecrated on June 5, 1983. That same year an addition designed by Higgins, Shirk & Colvig of Des Moines was added on the east side of the church and connects it to the rectory. It reflects the basilica's original design and provides a handicap entrance into the church. The Conrad Pickel Studio also designed the stained glass windows for the east addition. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 8, 1987. Pope John Paul II elevated St. John's Church to a Minor Basilica on October 4, 1989. Bishop William H. Bullock presided at the dedication liturgy on December 31, 1989. Architecture St. John's was designed in the basilica form of the Romanesque Revival style found in Northern Italy known as Lombardy Romanesque. The church is built of Indiana limestone that was probably acquired from Tri-Cities' Stone Company of Davenport, Iowa. The stone veneer is applied to the exterior in a random ashlar pattern. The cut stone trim was provided by Rowat Cut Stone Company of Des Moines. The church measures and has a campanile on the west rear of the building that contains a bell that was cast in 1961. The bell was installed by the I.T. Verdin Company of Cincinnati. Over the main entrance is a sculptural frame that includes a figure of Christ and angels. It is supported by columns in the Corinthian order with acanthus designs. The building is covered by a red tile roof, and the tower is capped by a bronze cross. The interior of the basilica is finished in plaster cast and travertine marble. The barrel vaulted coffered ceiling covered in gold leaf rises above the floor. The main nave is flanked by side aisles. Des Moines artist Dominic Damiana painted a mural of Christ the King surrounded by symbols of the Four Evangelists on the gilded upper section of the apse. The columns of the baldachin are Bescia marble and the high altar is Botticino marble. The clerestory windows depict the sacraments, cardinal virtues of the church, and offices and teachings of humankind. Below the windows are Scripture quotes relating to the institution of the sacraments and another set of quotes from the popular devotional prayer the Hail Mary. Below the quotes are a set of marble disks that symbolize the universality of the church. The church has a seating capacity of 900 people. Pipe organ The basilica's pipe organ is a 1963 Casavant Fr√®res Lt√©e., Opus 2723. The organ is located in the rear gallery of the church. Some of the pipes are exposed and frame the rose window. The traditional style console with roll top is in the center of the instrument in a fixed position. The organ features two manuals, three divisions, 30 stops, 30 registers, 38 ranks and 1,998 pipes. The manual compass is 61 notes and the pedal compass is 32 notes. The organ also has electro-pneumatic (EP) chests, drawknobs in vertical rows on angled jambs, balanced swell shoes/pedals and standard AGO placement. Rounding out the features are adjustable combination pistons, AGO Standard (concave radiating) pedalboard, crescendo pedal, reversible full organ/tutti toe stud, combination action thumb pistons and coupler reversible toe studs.

It starts from SR 705 near Yorkshire. The route moves north across several counties, then northeast against the side of the Grand Lake. SR 364 then travels west along a concurrency with SR 703, and ends at SR 29 near St. Marys. The route was designated in 1934, from SR 219 to SR 29. It was extended southwards to SR 705 in 1936 and completely paved by 1940. SR 364 was also extended in 1973 to the new alignment of SR 29. Route description SR 364 travels through portions of Darke, Mercer, and Auglaize Counties. There are no segments of SR 364 that are included within the National Highway System (NHS). The NHS is a network of highways identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the country. SR 364 starts at SR 705, on the Darke‚ÄìShelby county line. The route goes north in a straight line, through of Mercer County, and continues onto the Auglaize‚ÄìShelby county line. SR 364 continues into Auglaize County, where it passes by the St. Joseph Catholic Church, a historic site. The highway intersects SR 119 in Minister and SR 274 in New Bremen. Later, SR 364 intersects SR 219, and travels northeast, adjacent to the eastern side of the Grand Lake. Here, the farmland transitions into forests. The route meets at a T-intersection with SR 703\\\\. The SR 364 and SR 703 concurrency travels northwestward, and SR 364 splits and heads north, after slightly more than a mile. SR 364 crosses a railroad track, and ends at a diamond interchange at SR 29\\\\. The road continues as County Road 15 after this point. History Around 1932, a gravel road from SR 219 to SR 32 was built in Auglaize County, and was designated as SR 364 two years later. In 1936, the designation was extended southward along a gravel road from its terminus at SR 219. This changed the southern terminus to SR 705, east of Osgood in Darke County. SR 364's northern terminus, SR 32, was renumbered to SR 54 in 1938, and it was renumbered again to SR 29 one year later. The section of SR 364 from SR 219 to SR 29 was also paved at this time. All of the highway was paved by 1940. In 1973, SR 29 was realigned northward to a divided highway, and its old alignment became part of SR 703. SR 364 was also extended to SR 29 via a concurrency with SR 703.

It later became HMS Gamecock and then Gamecock Barracks. Royal Air Force operations The airfield was built by John Laing & Son in the late 1930s.Ritchie, p. 91 The first unit to use the airfield was No. 215 Squadron RAF who joined on 10 September 1939 with the Vickers Wellington and the Avro Anson before leaving on 8 April 1940. The next unit to use the station was No. 18 (Polish) Operational Training Unit (OTU) flying the Vickers Wellington which arrived from RAF Hucknall during June 1940. The unit used RAF Bitteswell and RAF Nuneaton as satellites between February 1942 and February 1943. However soon after this the OTU moved to RAF Finningley during March 1943. During the Battle of Britain No. 300 Polish Bomber Squadron was formed at the airfield on 1 July 1940 with the Fairey Battle I before moving to RAF Swinderby on 22 August 1940 accompanied by No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron which formed 21 days later and left for Swinderby 6 days later on the 28th. These squadrons were replaced by No. 304 Polish Bomber Squadron and No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron which formed at the airfield during August 1940 flying Battle I's and switched to Vickers Wellington IC's during November 1940 before moving to RAF Syerston on 2 December 1940. No. 151 Squadron RAF moved in on 28 November 1940 with the Hawker Hurricane with a detachment going to RAF Wittering. On 22 December 1940 the unit moved to Wittering to equip with the Boulton Paul Defiant I. Sometime in 1941 No. 1513 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF arrived using Airspeed Oxfords but after five years the unit moved out. During April 1943 No. 105 (Transport) Operational Training Unit formed at the airfield flying Vickers Wellingtons these were supplemented with Douglas Dakotas in March 1945. Between November 1944 and July 1945 Bitteswell was used as a satellite providing some relief for the busy station before the unit was renamed 1381 (T) Conversion Unit in August 1945 and moved out to RAF Desborough. The gap was somewhat filled by 1510 BAT Flight using the Oxford who arrived during July 1946. However, after four months the flight moved out. With the airfield being transferred to the Royal Navy being renamed HMS Gamecock. Royal Navy operations Supermarine Seafire F.47s of 1833 Squadron RNVR based at Bramcote in 1953. RNAS Bramcote was given the ships name HMS Gamecock following RN normal practice and it was used by flying units of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve between August 1947 and October 1957. The first unit to be based was 1833 Squadron equipped with Supermarine Seafire fighters. Initially the Seafire F15 and F.17 were used, but from June 1952, the unit became the only RNVR squadron to be equipped with the Seafire FR.47, fitted with contra-rotating propellers. These were replaced by the Hawker Sea Fury FB.11 in February 1954. The jet-powered Supermarine Attacker was received in October 1955, and because these required better runway facilities, the squadron then moved to nearby RAF Honiley. The Midland Air Division was formed on 1 July 1953 to control Bramcote-based squadrons. 1844 Squadron formed at Bramcote on 15 February 1954, being equipped with Fairey Firefly AS.6 anti- submarine aircraft. Grumman Avenger AS.5 aircraft replaced the Fireflies in March 1956. Both squadrons ceased to exist on 10 March 1957 when all of the United Kingdom's reserve flying units were disbanded as an economy measure. In 1959 the airfield was transferred to the British Army as Gamecock Barracks.

Hong Kong In Hong Kong there are four locomotives imported for the Kowloon-Canton Railway. It would later be used by MTR Corporation upon the merger. The first three were built by EMD in the US, introduced in 1961 and numbered 56‚Äì58. The fourth was built by Clyde Engineering in Australia, introduced in 1966 and numbered 59. All were equipped with 16-567C engines and Co-Co wheel arrangements. 59 suffered a collision and was rebuilt with a 16-645E engine. The No.57 retired in 2009 and others still in use as of 2012 the final 57 and 62 will be retired because of the change of the signal system. Mexico In order to replace steam on the numerous light rail branches operated by the Nacionales de Mexico (NdeM), EMD export models G12 and G16 were obtained. A total of 24 G16 units were built by EMD for the NdeM, all equipped with dynamic brakes and introduced between 08/1958 and 07/1960, their running numbers being 7300 to 7323. The first 13 units (Nr. 7300 to 7312) had close clearance cabs, the last 11 units (Nr. 7313 to 7323) were delivered in 1960 and received a standard cab. Nr.7323 was pictured in 1963 with a standard cab, but appeared in 1974 with a close clearance cab, indicating that this unit was either rebuilt or more probably renumbered. Spain The RENFE Class 1900, later known as RENFE Class 319 were to the G16 design; 10 of the units were built at General Motors factory in USA and were single cabin machines, identical to a standard G16 with the exception of having Iberian gauge wheelsets. A further 93 locomotives were built under license using the same components but as twin-cab machines with a different external appearance and internal arrangement of components. Yugoslav Railways The EMD G16 (J≈Ω series 661) was one of the most used diesel locomotives in Yugoslavia. The type is colloquially nicknamed \\"Kenedi\\" after the US President John F. Kennedy. After the breakup in 1991, the locomotives were passed on to successor states: =Croatia= In Croatia the locomotive is classified H≈Ω series 2061. As of 2007, the series has been withdrawn from service. Six modified units of the series 2061 is the series 2043. =Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Slovenia= In Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia and Slovenia have all kept the J≈Ω-era designation series 661. Today there are around 15 operational series 661 with Serbian Railways. Those locomotives are used mostly on non- electrified railways, primarily to haul freight trains, but also the passenger trains. =Kosovo= Kosovo Railways operates three former J≈Ω series 661. A fourth locomotive (001) was renumbered but is out of service. They no longer carry a type designation, instead they were just numbered 001 to 004. They are used to haul coal and clay trains. Locomotives 661-203 began a rebuilding program in 2008, undertaken by T≈ΩV Gredelj (Croatia) in association with Electro-Motive Diesel; the bogies and traction motors were retained, but with a new frame and engine (EMD 8-710G3A). The locomotives were also converted to twin cab designs. The resulting new loco has EMD model code JT38CW-DC.

Reg., 26 C.F.R. ¬ß 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) Similar definition of accrual basis accounting is true for financial accounting purposes, except that revenue can't be recognized until it is earned, even if a cash payment has already been received by the tax authorities. :See also Artnell Company v. Commissioner, US tax ruling on treatment of prepayments.  Modified cash basis  Also referred to as the modified cash basis, combines elements of both accrual and cash basis accounting. The modified method records income when it is earned but deductions when expenses are paid out. The recording of income is then of accrual basis, while the recording of expenses is cash basis. The modified method does not conform to the GAAP.

In 1984, producer Dino De Laurentiis created De Laurentiis Entertainment Group. He built and based a studio complex (now EUE/Screen Gems ) in Wilmington, North Carolina. The area quickly became one of the busiest production centers for film and television east of Hollywood. The North Carolina Film Office was created during a time when new technology, audience demand for location authenticity, and Hollywood‚Äôs need for lower production costs were driving filmmakers to search distant sites throughout the United States for fresh places to make movies.

Dick, which was written in 1976 and published posthumously in 1985. The film is written, directed, and produced by John Alan Simon and stars Jonathan Scarfe and Shea Whigham. Plot The story is set in an alternate reality America circa 1985 under the authoritarian control of President Fremont. It makes liberal references to the collected works of Philip K. Dick. Berkeley record store clerk Nick Brady (Jonathan Scarfe) lives modestly with his wife Rachel (Katheryn Winnick) and their infant son. Nick has been experiencing strange visions and dreams. He confides in Rachel and his best friend, science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick (Shea Whigham). Nick calls the source of his visions VALIS (Vast Alien Living Intelligence System). One recurring symbol that he has been seeing is an ichthys. While he and Phil sit at a table, an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick's head. He rushes his son to the ER, convinced that he has an inguinal hernia. The skeptical doctor is stunned to find that Nick is right. Nick has subsequent visions that tell him that he should relocate to Los Angeles, where he lands a job at a record label. Philip gets visited by two members of FAP (Friends of the American People). They press him for information about Nick's visions. The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip. After their liaison, she pretends to be underage, hoping to coerce him into revealing what Nick is seeing from VALIS. Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick. Meanwhile, Nick has a dream where a woman (Alanis Morissette) is singing. During the dream, someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive. Eventually, the woman turns up at Nick's record label, looking for a clerical job. She introduces herself as Sylvia, and Nick just assumes that she is a singer. Sylvia gradually reveals that she also receives visions from VALIS. She explains that there are several thousand people who receive transmissions from the orbiting satellite, and they are very loosely organized as a secret society. The Russian government blows up the orbiting VALIS satellite, and Sylvia explains that it will take another 100 years for a replacement satellite to arrive. She writes a song with subliminal lyrics about VALIS. Nick forces The Fisher Kings to record the song, despite their total disinterest in it. When they debut the song at a club, Nick explains to Philip how the subliminal messages are encoded in the recording. FAP arrest Nick and Philip. They waste little time in executing Nick, as well as Sylvia. The film ends with Philip in prison, writing about Nick's VALIS experience. While he is working in a field one day, some teenagers gawk at the prisoners and laugh. Their boombox is playing Sylvia's subliminal song, and Philip realizes that the secret society found a way to get the song out, despite FAP's best efforts.

Dick, including the 1985 novel Radio Free Albemuth, considered to be a semi-autobiography of the author. Producer John Alan Simon was attached to produce film adaptations based on the novels, including Radio Free Albemuth. Simon became the writer and director for the film adaptation for Radio Free Albemuth, and filming began in October 2007 in and around Los Angeles. Simon said that the film may be titled VALIS upon release. He explained, \\"The script is based at this point almost entirely on Radio Free Albemuth. The financiers like the title VALIS better - so that's the tentative title. Since Radio Free Albemuth is essentially the first draft of VALIS, we ended up with rights to both from the estate of Philip K. Dick.\\" He further commented that \\"if Radio Free Albemuth is successful, VALIS the book would form the basis for the sequel to VALIS the movie. In other words, the story of VALIS would form the basis for VALIS 2.\\"AN INTERVIEW WITH JOHN ALAN SIMON Release The film screened as a work in- progress on February 27, 2010, at the Sedona International Film Festival. The world premiere was at the Gotham Screen International Film Festival in October 2010. A trailer for the film was released on March 2, 2011. The film was released in select cities (in addition to VOD) on June 27, 2014, by Freestyle Releasing.http://freestylereleasing.com/radio-free-albemuth/ Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 36% of 11 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.4/10. Metacritic rated it 35/100 based on six reviews. Jeanette Catsoulis dismissed the film's \\"stiff staging and so-so special effects\\" in The New York Times before concluding, \\"The excellent Shea Whigham, as a science-fiction writer, is our guide and narrator, but even his gravitas won't keep you from laughing at an extraterrestrial who thinks that hiding subliminal messages in pop songs is the way to start a revolution.\\"Catsoulis, Jeanette. \\"Secrets of the Universe, Embedded in Pop Ditties\\", The New York Times. June 26, 2014. Richard Kuipers of Variety called it \\"an engrossing adaptation\\" that \\"operates successfully as a study of enlightenment and a straight-ahead conspiracy thriller\\". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"Though it echoes A Scanner Darkly in a few pleasing ways, Albemuth is a substantially less satisfying affair, one whose longueurs and (deliberately?) cheesy effects work will alienate all but Dick's hardcore devotees.\\" Gary Goldstein of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a sluggish, often cheesy sci-fi thriller\\".

Life  Cziffra was a Banat German in origin, born in 1900 in Arad in the Banat region, at that date in the Kingdom of Hungary, now in Romania. Cziffra made films from the 1930s onwards, at first in Hungary, and from 1936 in Germany as well, where however he was initially more active as a screenwriter. In 1945 in Prague, then occupied by the Germans, he made the film Leuchtende Schatten (\\"Glowing Shadows\\"). As adviser for the criminal police he was assigned SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Eweler, a member of the SD and brother of the actress Ruth Eweler. After some time Cziffra banned Eweler from the studios for excessive and obstructive criticism. Shortly afterwards he was arrested and taken to the Prague Gestapo Headquarters in the Pecec Palace, where he was accused of having eaten several times in the Czech restaurant \\"Neumann\\" without using ration stamps. He was eventually dispatched to Pankr√°c Prison, the remand and interrogation prison of Prague, and sentenced to six months' imprisonment, beginning on 12 February.According to some accounts Cziffra was only able to escape transportation to Theresienstadt by adroitly interfering with the files He was released from detention on 19 April, shortly before the end of the war. In 1945 in Vienna Cziffra founded the first post-war Austrian film production company: Cziffra-Film. Principally, and for preference, he made light entertainment and musical films with well-known German and Austrian actors such as Peter Alexander, Rudolf Platte, Senta Berger and Hubert von Meyerinck. Through the input of musicians like Bill Ramsey or Bully Buhlan the films mostly progressed to being musical revues with a local Austrian slant and flavour (Heimatfilme). Cziffra also worked as an actor himself, and later in his life published a number of books. He was married to the actress Ursula Justin, who starred in six of his films in the 1950s. He died on 28 April 1989 in Diessen am Ammersee in Bavaria.

Keratohyalin granules (KHG) mainly consist of keratin, profilaggrin, loricrin and trichohyalin proteins which contribute to cornification or keratinization, the process of the formation of epidermal cornified cell envelope. During the keratinocyte differentiation, these granules maturate and expand in size, which leads to the conversion of keratin tonofilaments into a homogenous keratin matrix, an important step in cornification. Keratohyalin granules can be divided in three classes: globular KHG (found in quickly dividing epithelia, such as the oral mucose), stellate KHG (found in the slowly dividing normal epidermis) and KHG of Hassall's corpuscles or type VI epithelioreticular cells of the thymus gland. The exact purpose of the keratinization of Hassall's corpuscles remains unknown. During skin differentiation process, keratohyaline granules discharge their contents in the junction between stratum granulosum and stratum corneum cell layers and form the barrier. At the same time, the inner side of the cell membrane thickens forming the cornified cell envelope. After the release of the granules, nuclei, ribosomes and mitochondria disappear, the cells become densely packacked with filaggrin and cover more surface. After final dehydration, the cell desquamates. The release of keratohyalin granules plays an important role in the skin moisturization. Filaggrin undergoes chemical modification and proteolytic processing which leads to the formation of natural moisturizing factor (NMF), hygroscopic amino acids and derivatives which function as UV protectant, modulate stratum corneum pH and water retention.

She was named in honor of U.S. Army general Mark Leslie Hersey. She was transferred to the U.S. Army as USAT General M. L. Hersey in 1946. On 1 March 1950 she was transferred to the Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) as USNS General M. L. Hersey (T-AP-148). She was later sold for commercial use, and operated under the names SS Pittsburgh and SS St. Louis. Operational history General M. L. Hersey (AP-148) was built by Kaiser Co., Inc. of Richmond, California under Maritime Commission contract MC #665. She was launched on 1 April 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Alice Hersey Wick, General Hersey's daughter and acquired by the Navy on 31 May 1944. She was commissioned on 29 July 1944 with Captain James W. Smith in command. After shakedown off San Pedro, General M. L. Hersey sailed from San Francisco in September with troops and cargo for garrisons in the Southwest Pacific. She reached Milne Bay, New Guinea on 21 September and subsequently carried troops and supplies to the Admiralty Islands, the Russell Islands, and the Solomon Islands, before departing Guadalcanal on 6 October for the United States. She brought home more than 3,000 veterans of the Pacific fighting, arriving in San Francisco on 19 October. Between 7 November 1944 and 14 August 1945 the transport made four round-trip voyages from San Francisco and, Seattle to the Western Pacific, carrying troops to New Guinea, the Philippines, the Palaus, and the Marianas during the final amphibious offensive against Japan, At Leyte in November General M. L. Hersey endured frequent air attacks. Following the surrender of Japan, she left Seattle 31 August and, steaming via the Philippines, she arrived in Yokohama on 24 September with occupation troops. There she embarked 3,052 troops and departed 5 days later as part of Operation Magic Carpet the sea-lift to return hundreds of thousands of American fighting men to the United States as quickly as possible. Between 3 December and 3 March 1946 she steamed twice to the Far East where she embarked returning veterans at Yokohama and Manila and transported them to San Pedro and San Francisco. Departing San Francisco on 23 March, she then steamed via Manila and Singapore to Calcutta, India, and Colombo, Ceylon, where she embarked \\"Magic Carpet\\" troops. She departed Colombo 28 April, sailed via the Suez Canal, and arrived in New York on 21 May. She decommissioned at New York 1 June and was turned over to War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 6 June for eventual use as a transport by the Army Transportation Service. Rebuilt by the Army to 12,545 tons, she was on duty for the International Refugee Organization (IRO) and initially based out of New Orleans (but later based out of New York). On 14 January 1947, during a return voyage from Bremerhaven, USAT General M. L. Hersey responded to distress calls issued by SS Tecumseh Park which was thought to be in danger of foundering off Halifax, Nova Scotia. General M. L. Hersey stood by for two days before Tecumseh Park got underway on her own. On 16 November 1949 USAT General M. L. Hersey left Naples with 1,283 displaced persons from Europe and arrived in Melbourne, Australia on 6 December 1949. This voyage was one of almost 150 \\"Fifth Fleet\\" voyages by some 40 ships bringing refugees of World War II to Australia. General M. L. Hersey made two more such trips, arriving in Melbourne with 1,336 refugees on 27 April 1950, and in Fremantle with 1,370 passengers on 2 November 1950. In the midst of her \\"Fifth Fleet\\" voyages to Australia, the transport was reacquired by the Navy 1 March 1950. General M. L. Hersey was placed in service and assigned to MSTS under a civilian crew. Continuing to operate out of New York, she resumed carrying European refugees to the United States in support of the IRO. On 07:32 on 4 November 1951, while ferrying elements of the 43rd Infantry Division to Bremerhaven, USNS General M. L. Hersey struck Argentine cruise ship MS Maipo amidships in thick fog over a calm North Sea. Maipo sank some three hours after the collision off Wangerooge. All 238 people aboard Maipo were rescued, and no one aboard General M. L. Hersey was injured. During 1952 and 1953 she made four round-trips from San Francisco to the Far East in support of the Korean War. She was placed out of service 11 June 1954 and placed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego. Later transferred to the Maritime Administration, on 3 September 1959 she entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, Suisun Bay, California. The ship was sold under the MARAD Ship Exchange Program to Sea-Land Service, Inc. on 16 August 1968 and renamed SS Pittsburgh. She was renamed SS St. Louis, USCG ON 515620, IMO 6903228, in September 1969, and converted by Todd Shipbuilding, San Pedro, CA to a container ship 10 January 1970.

At least four of his works are housed at the National Library of the Czech Republic.\\"Josef Wagner\\", 29-06-2006, Radio.cz.  Life  Born in Prague on 24 May 1938, he comes from an old artistic family. His father, Josef Wagner (1901‚Äì1957), was an outstanding sculptor of the interwar and post-war eras; his mother, Marie Wagnerov√°‚ÄìKulh√°nkov√° (1906‚Äì1983), as well as his brother, Jan Wagner (1941‚Äì2005), were also sculptors. Josef Wagner studied architecture at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. After graduation he devoted himself to the designing of housing and garden architecture, photography, and scenography. For almost 30 years he had been occupied with exhibition installations as head of the Exhibition Centre of the Union of Czechoslovak Visual Artists and as a collaborator of the National Gallery in Prague. On his study travels he visited a number of European countries, particularly France, Italy, Switzerland, and Greece. He has been living and working in Prague.  Work  J. Wagner started painting in 1957 and permanently since 1963. In his works he was gradually concerned with the themes of Prague, particularly of Hole≈°ovice and its port. In the latter half of the sixties, the themes of World War Two often appeared. After the occupation in 1968 he turned his attention also to general themes of still lifes and landscapes; dominating towers and cranes keep appearing. He created broadly conceived cycles of ‚ÄúHeads‚Äù (The Head of a Teacher, of Interrogator K., of Interrogator L., of a Deserter, or of an Executor of Police Orders), ‚ÄúSkulls‚Äù, ‚ÄúHonours‚Äù, or ‚ÄúBestiary‚Äù (Predatory Fish, Protected Hedgehog, Cocooned Scarab Beetle, Dragon). After 1989 J. Wagner has been creating also pictures and graphics inspired by study travels to Greece, Italy, and France, as well as works reflecting contemporary world in mythical motifs or symbols of power. His works are represented in a number of both state-owned and private collections, both in the Czech Republic and abroad. Apart from some 800 oil paintings, he is the author of a number of drawings and graphics (Grand Diploma for Graphic International Biennial Exhibition of Tuzla, 2004). He is the holder of the Award of the Czech-Bavarian Artistic Society (1994), the Award of the Masaryk Academy of Art (1997), and the Rudolph II Prize for Artistic and Cultural Activities (1997). Out of a number of exhibitions in the Czech Rep. and abroad (France, Greece, Netherlands, Switzerland, USA, Germany), the following may be pointed out: 172 Pictures and Drawings by Josef Wagner, Art Centre of Athens, Athens, Greece (1988), and Joseph Wagner r√©trospective de 1958-1997, Palais B√©n√©dicte, F√©camp, France (1999).

The event occurs annually in November, in London. Only products which pay the entry fee of ¬£140 per category are judged, and three/four bottles of each product must be supplied. Depending on the points out of 100 awarded, submitted products can receive gold outstanding, gold, silver outstanding, silver, or bronze awards, and there are no limitations on how many of each which can be awarded. There is also an extensive range of trophies each year. Judging The judging process consists of blind tasting and panel discussion. Entries are judged by panels drawn from 250 specialists from around the world. =Judging processes= The competition has its own purpose built premises including temperature controlled cellars, tasting rooms and regular staff. In 2019, IWSC wine judging moved to London for the first time. The competition has its own storage facilities and cellaring for over 30,000 bottles. It takes over six months to judge all the products as they are sorted into over 1,500 categories. The categories divide the entries by several factors: region or area; variety, style, or type; vintage or age; and similar characteristics. Wines and spirits that win awards go forward to the national or international level. The competition makes use of over 250 specialist judges from all over the world. Many are Masters of Wine, some are winemakers or distillers, others are trade specialists, each judging in their special field. All judges attend an IWSC judges induction course.

He was one of the senior members of the Royal House of Konbaung and the grandson of King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat. Taw Phaya Glay was also known as a historian for writing books on the about of the descendent of King Thibaw and writing a manifesto demanding that the British return the royal gems and jewellery taken on the annexation of the country. Early life and education Six siblings of Taw Phaya Galay Taw Phaya Galay was born on 30 July 1926 in Rangoon, British Burma to parent Ko Ko Naing, a former monk and Princess Myat Phaya Galay who was the fourth daughter of King Thibaw and Chief Queen Supayalat.Myanmar Chronicle Online Magazine: Local News for mid-July 2006 He attended St Patrick School in Moulmein and later moved to St Paul School in Yangon. Later, he left St Paul to attend the famous national school Myoma Kyaung. He failed his 1946 matriculation examination. He later took as his name U Thant Zin although royal family members did not use the U and Daw prefixes. He and his siblings were under the supervision of the British government and could not travel freely. Taw Paya Galay's three brothers were well known and much admired for their efforts to foster sports and culture through youth clubs during the Japanese occupation during World War II. Business career In 1948, he established and served as a director of the Thibaw Commercial Syndicate, one of the few at the time that were truly owned by the Myanmar, for most companies were owned by Indian entrepreneurs with Myanmar citizens as a front. By the late 1950s the Thibaw Commercial Syndicate Ltd was exporting lacquer sap to Japan and imperial Jade to Hong Kong, with branch offices in each of those places. He often flew to Tokyo and Hong Kong to oversee sales, and by the early 1960s his business was booming, with export contracts in rice worth K30 million. In 1950s, he established the Union of Burma Exporters Oriental Corporation also becoming its Director. Between 1955-1957, he served as an organizer at the Headquarters, Trade Union Congress (Burma) (TUCB). However, General Ne Win took power in Burma in a coup d‚Äô√©tat, and Taw Paya Galay's company, along with all others, was nationalised. Political movement Taw Paya Galay and his brothers actively supported Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, the revered \\"father of nationalism\\". He became an active member of the underground resistance before and during WWII, first against the British and then the Japanese. Between 1957 and 1960, he served as Central Executive Committee Member of the Internal Peace League, the World Peace Congress (Burma), and the Asia-Africa Consolidation Organization as treasurer, and for the National Committee against Kuomintang Invasion and Imperialism. In 1961, he worked for the China- Myanmar Friendship Association, and the Korea-Myanmar Friendship Association. In 1964, he was the administration manager at MIEc headquarters but resigned the following year by force because of his moral character. The president of the Chinese-Myanmar Friendship Association was arrested in 1966, just before riots broke out against the Chinese community in Burma. Taw Paya Galay went underground for nearly two years until he was caught and sent to Insein Prison, where he remained until 1970. During the countrywide uprising against the socialist regime in 1988, he became a patron of a powerful political assembly known \\"A Myo Thar Naing Ngan Yay Tat Paung Su\\" (Ma-Ma-Ta National Political Front).

It existed from 1910-1985. From 1940 until in 1985 the Eureka Classis served as the continuing RCUS as the rest of the denomination had merged into the new denomination, the Evangelical and Reformed Church. On May 6, 1986 the Eureka Classis was called to order and immediately dissolved to form the Synod of the Reformed Church in the United States.  Origins  From 1870 until about 1902 America had a wave of German immigrants. These Germans came from the South of Russia where their ancestors had moved at the invitation of Catherine the Great. Many of these immigrants ended up in the Dakotas. At this time the Reformed Church in the United States was also known as the German Reformed Church, so it was a logical denomination for the Reformed German- Russians to join. The RCUS at this time was in great turmoil on account of Mercersburg Theology and the liturgical controversy that arose out of that. The German-Russians were against the innovations of Mercersburg. Since these immigrants still spoke German as their primary language, they used a clause in the Constitution of the RCUS to organize based on language rather than the tradition geography. Yet, the real reason was to organize doctrinally. On June 7, 1911, seven ministers and sixteen congregations organized to form the Eureka Classis. The name of the Classis came from the Greek word ‚Äòeureka‚Äô which means ‚ÄòI found it‚Äô and not on the town Eureka, South Dakota, where the second meeting of the Classis would be held. The name was designed to mean that they had found a solution to their doctrinal problems with the rest of the denomination. As the RCUS had talks with the Evangelical Synod of North America, the Eureka Classis protested. It opposed the union of the two churches officially in 1932. The Eureka Classis voted against the proposed constitution of the new church in 1936. In 1940 when the merger became official and the Evangelical and Reformed Church was formed (E&R;), the Eureka Classis resolved to be the continuing RCUS. The Eureka Classis incorporated as the continuing Reformed Church in the United States in 1945 in the state of North Dakota. The Classis at that time consisted of ten pastors and twenty- eight churches.Hoeflinger, N and Stuebbe, R: \\"The History of the Eureka Classis: Reformed Church in the United States.\\" Reliance Publishing Co. 1986, pg.25.  Westminster Period 1953 to 1970  The Eureka Classis had always been short on ministers. The problem had gotten worse after the split with the E&R; as now there was not a seminary that could be trusted to send young men to be trained for the ministry. Two of the leading ministers in the Eureka Classis, Rev. Walter Grossmann and Rev. William Korn, began encouraging people to attend Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. In 1953, Lloyd Gross enrolled at Westminster and the Eureka Classis began a fruitful relationship with the seminary. Westminster not only trained young men from the RCUS, but sent other graduating students into the Eureka Classis to fill pulpits. Rev. Norman Hoeflinger was one such man and he became the first graduate of Westminster to serve in the Eureka Classis. This relationship with Westminster brought about a relationship with the Orthodox Presbyterian Church (OPC). Contact with non-German Reformed Churches helped open the mindset of the Eureka Classis to the outside world and the possibility of growth. In 1960, the Eureka Classis helped fund Harvey Conn of the OPC as a missionary. Also that year the church saw statistics of fourteen pastors and twenty congregations. Of that number at least five were Westminster graduates, and one was a transfer from the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. The relationship with Westminster ended in the early 70‚Äôs as the controversy around Rev. Norman Shepherd, professor at Westminster, caused the RCUS pull away from Westminster Seminary. The Eureka Classis would consider many alternatives to Westminster such as Mid-America Reformed Seminary as well as considering starting their own seminary.  Final Years 1970-1985  The Eureka Classis started to not only fund foreign missions, but began to get serious about home missions, as well. The Eureka Classis began outreach to churches and groups that were not from the German Reformed heritage. The Eureka Classis in 1970 had 22 ministers and 23 congregations.Hoeflinger, N and Stuebbe, R: \\"The History of the Eureka Classis: Reformed Church in the United States.\\" Reliance Publishing Co. 1986, pg. 49 By 1985 the Classis had grown to 32 congregations and 30 ministers.Hoeflinger, N and Stuebbe, R: \\"The History of the Eureka Classis: Reformed Church in the United States.\\" Reliance Publishing Co. 1986, pgs. 81-130 In 1985 the Classis voted to dissolve at their next meeting into four classes and form a Synod of the Reformed Church in the United States. The number of churches and the fact that the RCUS now reached from California to Florida aided that decision. A new constitution was approved, and in 1986 the Eureka Classis convened and dissolved into the Synod of the Reformed Church in the United States.

Its primary locations were in Fitzgerald and Ocilla, with a satellite and extended campuses located in Douglas, Pearson, and Rochelle. The school served the counties of Ben Hill/Irwin, Coffee, Atkinson, and Wilcox. Tift and Turner counties were originally to have been part of the school's area, but opted out before it began. The school also previously had campuses in Turner and Telfair counties, but in 2001 the Turner campus was transferred to Moultrie Technical College, and the Telfair campus to Heart of Georgia Technical College. On September 4, 2008, the State Board of Technical and Adult Education approved a merger East Central Technical College and Valdosta Technical College, effective July 1, 2010, as part of a larger program of restructuring throughout the TCSG. In 2009, it was announced that the new school would be known as Wiregrass Georgia Technical College. The merger was completed, as planned, on July 1, 2010. History In 1968 Lewis Brinson became the first director of Ben Hill-Irwin Area Vocational Institute. On September 21, 1970 200 full-time students enrolled at the institution and on September 15, 1971 the first full-time graduates received their diplomas. On June 9, 1978 a $600,000 campus expansion plan was completed. The school changed from being locally governed to being governed by the state under the direction of the Georgia Department of Technical and Adult Education (DTAE). In the fall of 1982, Ben Hill-Irwin Institute began a computer electronics program. It also expanded its machine shop curriculum through a co-op program with Robins Air Force Base in 1983. January 1, 1984 Dr. Ed Green became the new president after the retirement of Brinson. The school changed its name to Ben Hill Irwin Technical Institute and established a joint degree program with Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) in Tifton, which made it possible for ECTC students to earn an associate degree in applied science from ABAC in 1986. According to ectcollege.org on July 1, 1996 Dr. Diane Harper became the third president. On November 7, 1996 the school changed its name to East Central Technical Institute. Over the next few years, enrollment increased tremendously and the support of the community continued to grow. The college continued to expand throughout the 1990s with the opening of the Charles Harris Learning Center in 1994, the Douglas satellite campus in 1997, on July 16, 1998 the opening of the Wilcox Lifelong Learning Center, and on April 28, 1999 the new campus in Turner County. The name changed again to East Central Technical College in 2000 because of Georgia House bill 1187, that allowed institutes offering associate degrees to become colleges. Accreditation East Central Technical College was accredited by the Commission of the Council on Occupational Education to award associate degrees of applied technology, diplomas, and technical certificates of credit.

White in Loudoun County, Virginia in the winter of 1861-62. The battalion was initially raised as border guards along the Potomac River below Harpers Ferry but were ultimately mustered into regular service as part of the Laurel Brigade. Despite this, they continued to play a conspicuous role in the ongoing partisan warfare in Loudoun throughout the war. The battalion was particularly notable during the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign, when it played a prominent role in the Battle of Brandy Station and subsequently conducted a series of raids on Union-held railroads and defensive positions in Maryland and Pennsylvania. The 35th was the first Confederate unit to enter Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.Official Records, Series 1, Volume 39. Organization and service history Formed in December 1861 by Elijah V. White in Loudoun County, Virginia, the 35th consisted of six companies of cavalry, five of which were from Virginia and one from neighboring Maryland. * A - White's Rebels * B - Chiswell's Maryland Exiles (Montgomery County, Maryland) * C - Grubb's Company * D - Trayhern's Company * E - Grabill's Company (Page and Shenandoah counties) * F - Ferneyhough's Co. The battalion never reached enough strength to become of full regiment. It was initially assigned to border service in Loudoun County, aiding the commands of Maj. Gen. D.H. Hill in Leesburg and Lt. Gen. Stonewall Jackson in Winchester. When Hill's command was evacuated from Leesburg to Richmond during the Peninsula Campaign, the 35th briefly joined the 2nd Virginia Cavalry based in Fauquier County, frequently raiding the Union garrisons in Loudoun, before being assigned to Jackson, where it took part in his famous Valley Campaign. In late 1862 the 35th was briefly put under the control of Maj. Gen. Jeb Stuart. When not serving with the main army, the 35th was highly involved in the bitter partisan warfare that divided the loyalty of the residents of the Loudoun County. When mustered into the regular army, the 35th were frequently granted extended leave to return to Loudoun to seek forage and new mounts, and while at home often engaged the Federals in the area, including their western county nemesis, the Loudoun Rangers such as at the Fight at Waterford. In addition, one of White's men, John Mobberly, broke off from the unit and formed an independent guerrilla command that terrorized northwest Loudoun County during the later years of the war. =Gettysburg Campaign= As J.E.B. Stuart began concentrating widely scattered Confederate cavalry and mounted infantry units in late May 1863 in preparation for the upcoming summer campaign, the 35th Battalion was assigned to the brigade of William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones in the Army of Northern Virginia. The 35th took part in the Battle of Brandy Station on June 9. It formed a key part of the defensive position near St. James Church early in the battle, helping to fend off a series of charges by Union cavalry. Later, the battalion made a key counterattack on Federal troops on Fleetwood Hill, helping stabilize the Confederate line.Official Records, Series 1, Vol. 39, pp. 684, 1062. Within a few days after Brandy Station, the 35th was attached to the Second Corps of Lt. Gen. Richard Ewell to screen the advance into Maryland and Pennsylvania, and to conduct a series of raids against Federal supply lines. White led a daring attack on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad depot at Point-of-Rocks, Maryland, in which he routed his old nemesis, the Loudoun Rangers, seized and burned supply wagons, and captured a trainload of supplies intended for the Union garrison at nearby Harpers Ferry. After entering Pennsylvania on June 23, Ewell assigned the 35th to the division of Maj. Gen. Jubal A. Early, which reached Gettysburg on June 26. White's men routed Union militia and home guard cavalry near Marsh Creek and became the first Confederate troops to enter the borough. The 35th was assigned by Early to accompany a separate expeditionary force of infantry, artillery, and cavalry under the command of Brig. Gen. John B. Gordon that departed Gettysburg for York County, Pennsylvania, with a goal of capturing the town of York and seizing important Susquehanna River crossings. White's battalion destroyed scores of railroad bridges and conducted a successful raid that seized the important railroad and telegraphic center at Hanover Junction, Pennsylvania. Elements of the battalion were among the first Confederate troops to reach the Susquehanna at Wrightsville, Pennsylvania, on June 28, skirmishing with the First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry before turning westward, where the 35th performed scouting and flank protection duty during the Battle of Gettysburg. =Later campaigns and actions= Later in 1863, the 35th was re-attached to the famed \\"Laurel Brigade,\\" serving again directly under General Jones in the Mine Run and Bristoe campaigns. In 1864, the 35th was again active in the Loudoun Valley, as well as supporting the Army of Northern Virginia during the Overland Campaign and subsequent actions. In September 1864, the 35th accompanied Lt. Gen. Wade Hampton on his famous Cattle raid, where they played a key role in driving off the Federal cattle guards and securing the cattle. In April 1865, the battalion was the rearguard as the Army of Northern Virginia retreated up the Appomattox River. Just prior to Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House, members of the 35th served as couriers delivering General Ulysses S. Grant's surrender terms. Lt. Colonel White and the 35th did not surrender with the rest of the army, but instead rode around enemy lines and returned to Loudoun County, where they disbanded. =In Popular Media= In his 1987 novel, \\"Spangle,\\" author Gary Jennings gives a semi-fictionalized account of the battalion's break-up, via the fictional Col.

History The name of Isenoumi stable relates to one of the oldest elder names in sumo, dating back to the mid-eighteenth century. The legendary Tanikaze, one of the first yokozuna, and his prot√©g√© Raiden, arguably the greatest rikishi ever, were both members of the first stable to be named Isenoumi.

In December 1982 former sekiwake Fujinokawa took charge of the stable. The retirement of Tosanoumi in December 2010 briefly left Isenoumi stable without any sekitori for the first time since 1983, until Ikioi was promoted to the j≈´ry≈ç division a year later. The former Fujinokawa reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 in September 2011 and passed the stable to former maegashira Kitakachidoki. The stable was for a long time situated in Tokyo's Edogawa ward, and to help tackle the high crime rate in that area, the former Isenoumi Oyakata instructed his wrestlers to go on night patrols, the first stable to do so. In April 2012 the stable moved to new facilities in Bunkyo ward. As of 2018 the stable has a policy of not accepting foreign-born wrestlers or ex-university competitors.

Imran (born 1956, Hyderabad, India), is an Indian medical inventor, entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Imran has formed over 20 medical device companies since the early 1980s and holds over 400 patents. He is known for his role in developing the world's first implantable cardiac defibrillator.  Early life and education  Born and raised in Hyderabad, India, the son of a doctor, Imran was a problem-solver from a young age. As a child, he enjoyed taking toys apart to see how they worked, and as a teenager learned how to repair and build AM radios. After attending All Saints High School in Hyderabad, Imran moved to New Jersey in 1973 to attend Rutgers University. At Rutgers he received a BS in electrical engineering in 1976, followed by an MS in biomedical engineering. He then spent three years At Rutgers Medical School before deciding to leave and work on the first implantable cardioverter- defibrillator with Intec Systems. Imran attributes his pursuit of innovation to being inspired by an experience he had as a college student: ‚ÄúI had a summer job working at The Matheney School for Cerebral Palsy Children. They needed engineers to develop communication devices for quadriplegic cerebral palsy children, so I built a machine for one severely afflicted girl. The unit translated her facial expressions using pre-recorded phrases, allowing her to communicate.‚Äù Innovation and entrepreneurship Imran says that he is motivated by \\"understanding and trying to solve big problems in medicine.\\" His interest is to develop medical devices that blur the distinction between organic and synthetic and advance patient treatment. He joined Intec Systems in 1980 and developed IP key to the development of the automatic implantable defibrillator, a device that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives, and has become a standard of care in cardiology. Intec Systems was acquired by Eli Lily, spun out to form Guidant, and acquired by Boston Scientific in 2006 for $27.5 billion. In 1992, Imran invented a cooled RF ablation catheter for the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. This invention became the initial product of Cardiac Pathways, and is now widely used by cardiac electro- physiologists. In 1995, he developed a low-pressure balloon and aspirator system for use in catheter-based interventions. Imran was the first to articulate the concept of embolic protection during high-risk interventions, and his device became the primary innovation for Percusurge, which was acquired by Medtronic in December 2000. In 2017, Imran announced the development of the Rani pill, a novel approach to the oral delivery of large drug molecules which previously have only been deliverable via injections. Imran describes this development as ‚Äúa mini swallowable auto-injector‚Äù that delivers the drug directly into the highly vascular intestine wall, allowing the drug to be absorbed quickly into the bloodstream. Imran‚Äôs research interests are wide-ranging and include tissue engineering, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, orthopedics, congestive heart failure and artificial organs. =InCube Labs= Imran founded InCube Labs in 1995 after forming eight venture-backed medical device companies. Imran‚Äôs concept was that InCube would function as an applied research institute. Since the formation of InCube Labs, Imran has formed more than 20 life sciences companies. These include Rani Therapeutics, which was established in 2012 after beginning as a research project within InCube Labs. Venture capital Imran is an active angel investor and a limited partner in several venture funds. He is the founder and Managing Director of InCube Ventures, a medical device venture fund. =InCube Ventures= InCube Ventures is an early stage life science venture capital fund. Imran co-founded InCube Ventures with Andrew Farquharson and Wayne Roe. The fund invests in both InCube Labs‚Äô companies as well as external companies. The fund primarily invests in novel therapies that have the potential to dramatically improve patient care.

A list of colonists is provided in Richard Hakluyt's The Principal Navigations, Voyages, Traffiques, And Discoveries Of The English Nation, although no author is recorded for the list. The list denotes 107 men who served under Lane, for a total of 108 colonists. A point of contention among historians is that John White is not listed among the 1585 colonists. White is known to have arrived at Roanoke with the colonists, but there is no record of him remaining with the colony through the winter or returning to England with Richard Grenville's fleet. David Beers Quinn argued that White must have remained in the colony long enough to produce a map based on the colonists' 1586 exploration of the region. He speculated that a simple error could have omitted White from the list, or included him as \\"Iohn Twyt,\\" \\"William White,\\" or \\"Iohn Wright.\\" In contrast, James Horn observed that White produced no known artwork of the people and towns discovered after August 1585, suggesting he was no longer present in the colony. As for the map, Horn argued that White, who was not a surveyor, would have based his illustration on someone else's survey data, making it no less plausible that he received such data in England than at Roanoke. In any event, the dispute raises the possibility of errors in the list Hakluyt published, and that the figure of 108 may not be exact. 1587 colony Following the evacuation of the 1585 Roanoke colony, Walter Raleigh commissioned a second colony to be established by John White in 1587. The second colony was intended to settle in Chesapeake Bay, but instead was deposited on Roanoke Island. The colonists requested that White return to England, with the expectation that he would come back to Roanoke with fresh supplies in 1588. When White finally returned in 1590, the site of the colony was abandoned. The exact number of people in the \\"Lost Colony\\" is disputed. Hakluyt's Principal Navigations provides a list of 119 individuals who \\"safely arrived in Virginia\\" and remained there as of August 1587. The list is not credited, but was presumably compiled by White, given his unique familiarity with the matter. However, White himself is included in the list, as well as Simon Fernandes (who also returned to England) and two men who had died prior to White's departure. The name \\"Thomas Harris\\" appears twice, possibly representing two men with the same name or an unintentional duplication. These problems suggest the possibility of other, less obvious issues in the list. In a 1955 analysis of the list, David Beers Quinn determined \\"therefore, eighty- five men, less one dead (George Howe) and two returned (John White and Simon Fernandez), seventeen women and eleven children, making 113 brought from England and 110 left by White, plus two children born on Roanoke Island and two Indians, the total left behind being 114.\\" However, Quinn's count of 85 European men may be in error, as he presents all 91 names from Hakluyt but only deducts three. A very conservative tabulation (discounting White, Fernandes, Howe, Thomas Smith and the second Thomas Harris, and assuming Manteo and Towaye did not reside with the colony) would yield a population of 112 following White's departure. In contrast, Andy Gabriel-Powell proposed that the Hakluyt list may be incomplete, and that the total could be as high as 121. =Men= =Women= =Children= =Children born at the colony= =Native American repatriates= See also *English colonial empire *List of people who disappeared Notes References 1590s missing person cases English colonization of the Americas History of the Thirteen Colonies Pre-statehood history of North Carolina Roanoke ","title":"List of colonists at Roanoke"},{"id":"14333214","text":"This is a list of members of the recent House of Wettin.

She has been given three dates of birth over time; 9 February; 4 May; and 25 May. 1677 ‚Äì 1 February 1749) was the youngest illegitimate daughter of Louis XIV of France and his ma√Ætresse-en-titre, Fran√ßoise-Ath√©na√Øs de Rochechouart, Marquise de Montespan. At the age of 14, she was wed to her first cousin Philippe d'Orl√©ans, future Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. Through two of the eight children she bore him in an unhappy marriage she became the ancestress of several of Europe's Roman Catholic monarchs of the 19th and 20th centuries, notably those of Belgium, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and France. Biography Fran√ßoise Marie was born in 1677, at the ch√¢teau de Maintenon, owned since 1674 by Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, marquise de Maintenon, the governess of Madame de Montespan's illegitimate children by Louis XIV. She and her younger brother, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse were cared for by Mmes de Monchevreuil, de Colbert and de Jussac under Mme. de Maintenon's' supervision, their mother being eventually ostracized from court. As a child, she was brought occasionally to Versailles to visit her parents. =Mademoiselle de Blois= On 22 November 1681, at the age of four and a half, Fran√ßoise Marie was legitimised by Louis XIV and given the courtesy title of Mademoiselle de Blois, a style held previously by her older half-sister, Marie Anne de Bourbon, a legitimised daughter of the king by Louise de La Valli√®re. The name of her mother was not mentioned in the act of legitimisation because Madame de Montespan was still married to the Marquis de Montespan, who might have counter-claimed paternity and custody of his wife's children. By the time of her birth, her parents' relationship was coming to an end because of Madame de Montespan's possible involvement in the Affaire des poisons.Hilton, Lisa, Ath√©na√Øs: The Real Queen of France, p. 187 Her older siblings Louis Auguste and Louise Fran√ßoise had been legitimised on 19 December 1673 by letters patent registered at the Parlement de Paris. Her younger brother, Louis Alexandre, was legitimised at the same time as she and given the title of comte de Toulouse. She remained close to him all her life, as well as to their older brother, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine. She was never close to her legitimate half brother, Louis, Dauphin of France. Fran√ßoise wielded little political influence considering her near relationships to France's rulers during most of her life. She was involved in the botched Cellamare Conspiracy in 1718 which was supposed to oust her own husband as regent in favour of her full brother Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, Duke of Maine. She inherited her mother's beauty, Madame de Caylus commented that Fran√ßoise was naturally timid and glorious and was a little beauty with a beautiful face and beautiful hands; completely in proportion.Memoirs of Madame de Caylus She was proud of her royal ancestry and of the royal blood of the House of Bourbon she inherited from her father: Later, it was joked that she would \\"remember she was a daughter of France, even while on her chaise perc√©eFraser, Lady Antonia, Love and Louis XIV, Nan A. Talese, 2006, pp. 279, 282, 284 The marquis d'Argenson said she was very like her mother, but had also Louis XIV's orderly mind with his failings of injustice and harshness. Among her male line descendants are Philippe Egalit√©, Louis-Philippe I, King of the French, and Prince Henri, Count of Paris, the present Orl√©anist pretender to the French throne. She is also an ancestor of Juan Carlos I of Spain, Albert II, King of the Belgians, Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, the pretender to the Italian throne. Marriage Fran√ßoise Marie, by Fran√ßois de Troy. Madame de Maintenon was a childless widow who, as the king's morganatic wife from the mid 1680s, promoted her charges' interests, scandalizing the court by securing the marriage of Mlle de Blois to the king's only legitimate nephew, Philippe d'Orl√©ans in 1692. Then known by his father's subsidiary title, Duke of Chartres, he was the son of Philippe de France, duc d'Orl√©ans known, as the king's only brother, as Monsieur. The m√©salliance between bastard and legitimate blood royal disgusted Philippe's mother, Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, whose prejudice against her brother-in- law's bastards was well known. Upon learning of her son's acquiescence to the betrothal, she slapped him in front of the court, then turned her back on the king who had bowed in salutation to her. She remained an enemy to her daughter-in-law and indifferent to her grandchildren by her. On the occasion of the marriage between their respective children, Louis XIV gave to his brother the Palais-Royal where the Orl√©ans had been residing, but which they had not owned.Dufresne, Claude, les Orl√©ans, CRITERION, Paris, 1991, pp. 77‚Äì78. Formerly known as the Palais Cardinal, the palace had been bequeathed to the crown by its builder, Cardinal Richelieu, upon his death in 1642. Louis XIV also promised an important military post to the Duke of Chartres and gave 100,000 livres to the Duke of Orl√©ans' favourite, the Chevalier de Lorraine. Upon being informed of the identity of her future husband, Fran√ßoise remarked: > Je ne me soucie pas qu'il m'aime, je me soucie qu'il m'√©pouse. (\\"I care not > that he love me, but that he marries me\\") Fran√ßoise and Philippe d'Orl√©ans were married on 18 February 1692 in the chapel of the Palace of Versailles. The service was conducted by the Cardinal de Bouillon ‚Äì a member of the House of La Tour d'Auvergne. In 1685, the Cardinal de Bouillon had refused to take part in the marriage of the Duke of Bourbon and Fran√ßoise's sister, Mademoiselle de Nantes, and, as a result, had been sent into exile, but he was recalled for the wedding of Fran√ßoise and the Duke of Chartres. After the ceremony, a banquet was given in the Hall of Mirrors with all the princes and princesses of the blood in attendance.The Unruly Daughter of the Regent Other guests included the exiled James II of England and his consort, Mary of Modena. At the newlyweds' bedding ceremony later that evening, Queen Mary handed the new Duchess of Chartres her night shirt. Madame de Montespan had not been invited to the wedding of her daughter. As her new husband was a legitimate grandson of a king, Fran√ßoise assumed the rank of petite-fille de France (\\"Grand-Daughter of France\\"), and was addressed as Royal Highness. Furthermore, the newlyweds traveled and lodged wherever the king did, dined with him, and were entitled to armchairs in his presence.Spanheim, √âz√©chiel, pp. 87, 100‚Äì105, 313‚Äì314, 323‚Äì327. As the new duchesse de Chartres, Fran√ßoise Marie was next in precedence behind only the Duchess of Burgundy, and her own mother-in-law, the Duchess of Orl√©ans. From her father, Fran√ßoise Marie received a dowry of more than two million livres, twice the sum bestowed on her older sister, Louise, who had married Louis, Duke of Bourbon, first prince of the blood royal, whose rank was deemed substantially lower than that of the king's nephew. This difference led to animosity between the sisters. The dowry was not to be paid until the Nine Years' War was over.Pevitt, Christine, Philippe, Duc d'Orl√©ans: Regent of France, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1997, pp. 41, 43, 56 Around 1710, an account of her was written by her husband's friend, the proud Duke of Saint- Simon: > [i]n every way majestic; her complexion, her throat, her arms, were > admirable; she had a tolerable mouth, with beautiful teeth, somewhat long; > and cheeks too broad and too pendant, which interfered with, but did not > spoil her beauty. What disfigured her the most were her eyebrows, which > were, so to speak, peeled and red, with very little hair; she had, however, > fine eyelashes, with well-set, chestnut-coloured hair. Without being > humpbacked or deformed, she had one side larger than the other, which caused > her to walk awry; and this defect in her figure indicated another, which was > more troublesome in society and which inconvenienced herself.French Memoirs > of the Duke of Saint-Simon c. 1710 Galatea Triumphant, 1692, Pierre Gobert. Her mother-in-law wrote the following in her memoirs: > all the ladies in waiting have made her believe that she did my son honour > in marrying him; and she is so vain of her own birth and that of her > brothers and sisters that she will not hear a word said against them; she > will not see any difference between legitimate and illegitimate > children.Translated memoirs of the Duchess of Orl√©ans Not long after their marriage, Philippe openly ridiculed his wife's bad temper, nicknaming her Madame Lucifer. Her mother-in-law said that during the early years of the Chartres marriage, Fran√ßoise was as \\"drunk as drunk\\" three to four times a week. The union, despite open discord, produced eight children, several of whom later married into other European royal families during the Regency of her husband for the young king Louis XV of France. Fran√ßoise Marie was so annoyed at her children not being recognised as grandchildren of a king that Saint-Simon wrote: > The duchesse d'Orl√©ans had a head filled with fantasies that she could not > realise... Not content with the modern rank of Granddaughter of France, > which she enjoyed through her husband, she could not bear the idea that her > children were only Princes of the Blood and dreamed up a rank for them that > was betwixt and between...great-Grandchildren of France.Goldhammer, Arthur, > Saint-Simon and the court of Louis XIV (translated memoirs of Saint-Simon), > University of Chicago Press, London, 2001, p. 33 Duchess of Orl√©ans Fran√ßoise Marie with her son, by Pierre Gobert. In 1701, upon the death of his father, her husband became Duke of Orl√©ans, head of the House of Orl√©ans and inherited his father's estates. The new Duchess of Orl√©ans acquired precedence over her mother-in-law, becoming second in rank only to the Dauphine (Duchess of Burgundy). Her father-in-law had died of a stroke at Saint-Cloud following an argument with Louis XIV at Marly concerning the Duke of Chartres' flaunting his pregnant mistress, Marie-Louise de S√©ry, in front of Fran√ßoise. Nonetheless, the new Duke and Duchess of Orl√©ans took up a lavish lifestyle at the Palais-Royal in Paris and the Ch√¢teau de Saint- Cloud, located some ten kilometers west of Paris. The private apartments of the duke and duchess at the Palais-Royal were designed and decorated by the renowned Jean B√©rain. While her husband led the debauched life of a womaniser, Fran√ßoise lived a quiet life without scandal, unlike her sisters, the Princess of Conti and the Duchess of Bourbon, and their older brother, the Duke of Maine. Though witty and charming, she preferred the company of the Duchess of Sforza. Her intimate circle included her cousins, Marie √âlisabeth de Rochechouart, Countess of Castries, who was also her lady-in-waiting, as well as Diane Gabrielle Damas de Thianges, daughter of Fran√ßoise's aunt, Gabri√®lle de Rochechouart de Mortemart. Two days after her birthday in 1707, Fran√ßoise Marie lost her mother who had lived in seclusion since being banished from court in 1691. Her father forbade his legitimised children to wear mourning clothes for their mother, but they chose to absent themselves from court gatherings during the mourning period, with the exception of their eldest brother, the Duke of Maine, who inherited the entirety of his mother's vast fortune.Mitford, Nancy, The Sun King, pp. 136, 165 In 1710 Louis XIV's youngest legitimate grandson, Charles, Duke of Berry, was still unmarried. It was suggested that he marry Louise √âlisabeth de Bourbon, the daughter of Louise, Duchess of Bourbon. But on 6 July 1710 Fran√ßoise secured the marriage of her eldest daughter, Marie Louise √âlisabeth d'Orl√©ans, to the duke, much to the annoyance of the Duchess of Bourbon. This marriage elevated Marie Louise √âlisabeth to the rank of fille de France, above princesses of the blood. Ch√¢teau de Bagnolet, Fran√ßoise Marie's favourite residence. Engraving by Jacques Rigaud. On the death of his great-grandfather Louis XIV, in 1715, the five-year-old Dauphin became the new king of France as Louis XV. There was a great deal of tension between Fran√ßoise's older brother, the Duke of Maine, and her husband, the Duke of Orl√©ans, over who was to be named regent during the minority of the new king. The Parlement de Paris ruled in favour of her husband. As the wife of the de facto ruler of France, Fran√ßoise became the most important lady of the kingdom. During the Regency, her husband increased her annual allowance to 400,000 livres. In March 1719, she acquired the ch√¢teau de Bagnolet near Paris, and, at her death, the estate passed to her son, Louis d'Orl√©ans, Louis le Pieux. Fran√ßoise Marie extended the small ch√¢teau under the direction of Claude Desgots who also worked at the duc du Maine's ch√¢teau de Sceaux. =Family life= Her many daughters were rumoured to be promiscuous. Having become a widow, the Duchess of Berry accumulated lovers and hid several pregnancies. She almost died in labor early in 1719, having been denied the sacraments by the church and when she died on 21 July 1719, she was again pregnant.De Barth√©l√©my, E. (ed.), Gazette de la R√©gence. Janvier 1715-1719, Paris, 1887. After the liaison of her favourite daughter, Charlotte Agla√©, with the libertine Louis Fran√ßois Armand du Plessis, duc de Richelieu was discovered, Fran√ßoise and her husband swiftly married her abroad. At the same time, the Cellamare Conspiracy was uncovered. The Duke and Duchess of Maine, as well as the duc de Richelieu, were arrested for participating in the plot and temporarily imprisoned. Earlier, Fran√ßoise had tried to get either Louise Ad√©la√Øde or Charlotte Agla√© to marry the Duke of Maine's son, Louis Auguste, Prince of Dombes, but both refused their cousin. In 1721, marriage arrangements into the royal family of Spain were also agreed upon for two of her other daughters, Louise √âlisabeth, and Philippine √âlisabeth. Louise √âlisabeth was to marry the Infante Luis Felipe of Spain, heir to the throne, while Philippine √âlisabeth was to marry Luis Felipe's younger half-brother, the Infante Carlos. Both marriages took place but that of Philippine √âlisabeth was annulled and she returned to France. She died at the ch√¢teau de Bagnolet in 1734. After the death of her husband in December 1723, Fran√ßoise retired to Saint-Cloud. Fran√ßoise Marie as she appeared during the Regency; by Etienne Jahandier Desroches In 1725, Fran√ßoise Marie saw the marriage of her cousin, the young King Louis XV, to the Polish princess Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, diminishing her precedence at court, as did the birth of their daughters. As it turned out, the second of the king's eight daughters, Madame Henriette, fell in love with Fran√ßoise Marie's grandson, Louis Philippe, then the duc de Chartres. Louis XV would not, however, allow the marriage because he did not want the House of Orl√©ans to come too close to the throne of France. Afterwards, it fell upon the dowager duchess to find her unwed grandson a suitable bride. At the direction of her son, Fran√ßoise Marie negotiated with her niece, Louise √âlisabeth de Bourbon, for her grandson to marry Louise √âlisabeth's attractive daughter, Louise Henriette de Bourbon. This marriage united a grandchild of Fran√ßoise Marie with a grandchild of her sister and enemy, the Duchess of Bourbon. Fran√ßoise Marie lived to see, in 1747, the birth of their great -grandson, the future Philippe √âgalit√©. The next of her daughters to marry was the youngest. Louise Diane, the favourite of Madame, was engaged to the young Louis Fran√ßois de Bourbon, Prince of Conti whom she married at Versailles. Louise died in childbirth at the Ch√¢teau d'Issy. Louise Diane's only surviving child was the last Prince of Conti, who would later marry Princess Maria Fortunata of Modena. Maria Fortunata was one of the daughters of the wayward Charlotte Agla√©, who was Fran√ßoise Marie's most difficult daughter. She returned from Modena in a self-imposed exile many a time and Fran√ßoise Marie and her son Louis chose to ignore her when she did. She returned to Modena in 1737 as the Sovereign Duchess Consort. Death Fran√ßoise died on 1 February 1749 at the Palais Royal after a long illness, aged 71. She was the last surviving child of Louis XIV. She had outlived her husband by twenty-six years. She was survived by two children, Charlotte Agla√© and Louis, Duke of Orl√©ans. She was buried in the Church of Madeleine de Traisnel (√âglise de la Madeleine de Traisnel) in Paris, an old Benedictine church at 100 Rue de Charonne in Paris on 6 February. Her heart was taken to the Val-de-Gr√¢ce.

Cardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone, papal diplomat Life Commendone was born at Venice. After an education in the humanities and in jurisprudence at the University of Padua, he came to Rome in 1550. The ambassador of Venice presented him to Pope Julius III, who appointed him one of his secretaries. After successfully performing various papal missions of minor importance, he accompanied Cardinal Legate Girolamo Dandino to the Netherlands, whence Pope Julius III sent him in 1553 on an important mission to Queen Mary Tudor, who had just succeeded Edward VI on the English throne. He was to treat with the new queen concerning the restoration of the Catholic faith in England. Accompanied by Penning, a servant and confidant of Cardinal Reginald Pole, Commendone arrived in London on 8 August 1553. Though Mary Tudor was a loyal Catholic, she was surrounded at court by numerous opponents of papal authority, who made it difficult for Commendone to obtain a secret interview with her. By chance he met John Lee, a relation of the Duke of Norfolk and an attendant at court, with whom he had become acquainted in Italy, and Lee succeeded in arranging the interview. Mary received Commendone kindly, and expressed her desire to restore the Catholic Faith and to acknowledge the spiritual authority of the pope, but considered it prudent to act slowly on account of her powerful opponents, Commendone hastened to Rome, arriving there on 11 September, and informed the pope of the news, at the same time handing him a personal letter from the queen. Commendone continued to hold the office of papal secretary under Pope Paul IV, who esteemed him very highly and in return for his services appointed him bishop of Kephalonia and Zacynthus in 1555. In the summer of 1556 he accompanied Cardinal Legate Scipione Rebiba on a papal mission to the Netherlands, to the courts of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King Philip II of Spain, the consort of Queen Mary of England. Commendone had received instructions to remain as nuncio at the court of Philip, but he was recalled to Rome soon after his arrival in the Netherlands. On 16 September of the same year the pope sent him as extraordinary legate to the Governments of Urbino, Ferrara, Venice, and Parma in order to obtain help against the Spanish troops who were occupying the Campagna and threatening Rome. In 1560, when Pope Pius IV determined to reopen the Council of Trent, Commendone was sent as legate to Germany to invite the Catholic and Protestant Estates to the council. He arrived in Vienna on 3 January 1561, and after consulting with Emperor Ferdinand, set out on 14 January for Naumburg, where the Protestant Estates were holding a religious convention, He was accompanied by Delfino, Bishop of Lesina, who had been sent as papal nuncio to Ferdinand four months previously and was still at the imperial court. Having arrived at Naumburg on 28 January, they were admitted to the convention on 5 February and urged upon the assembled Protestant Estates the necessity of a Protestant representation at the Council of Trent in order to restore religious union, but all their efforts were of no avail. From Naumburg, Commendone traveled northward to invite the Estates of Northern Germany. He went by way of Leipzig and Magdeburg to Berlin, where he arrived on 19 February and was well received by Joachim of M√ºnsterberg, the Elector of Brandenburg. Joachim spoke respectfully of the pope and the Catholic Church and expressed his desire for a religious reconciliation, but did not promise to appear at the council. Here Commendone met also the son of Joachim, the young Archbishop Sigismund of Magdeburg, who promised to appear at the council but did not keep his word. Leaving Berlin, Commendone visited Beeskow, Wolfenb√ºttel, Hanover, Hildesheim, Iburg, Paderborn, Cologne, Cleves, the Netherlands, and Aachen, inviting all the Estates he met in these places. From Aachen he turned to L√ºbeck with the intention of crossing the sea to invite Kings Frederick II of Denmark and Eric XIV of Sweden. The King of Denmark, however, refused to receive the legate, while the King of Sweden invited him to England, whither he had planned to go in the near future. Queen Elizabeth I of England had forbidden the papal nuncio Hieronimo Martinengo to cross the English Channel when he was sent to invite the queen to the council, hence it was very improbable that she would allow Commendone to come to England. He therefore repaired to Antwerp, awaiting further instructions from Rome. Being recalled by the pope, he returned to Italy in December, 1561, by way of Lorraine and Western Germany. The numerous letters which Commendone wrote during this mission to Charles Borromeo present a picture of the ecclesiastical conditions in Germany during those times. These and others were published in \\"Miscellanea di Storia Italiana\\" (Turin, 1869, VI, 1-240). In January 1563, the legates of the Council of Trent sent Commendone to Emperor Ferdinand at Innsbruck, to treat with him regarding some demands which he had made upon the council in his \\"Libel (=\\"little book, tract,\\" not modern English \\"libel\\") of Reformation.\\" In October of the same year Pius IV sent him as legate to King Sigismund II of Poland with instruction to induce this ruler to give political recognition to the Tridentine decrees. Yielding to the requests of Commendone and of Hosius, Bishop of Ermland, Sigismund not only enforced the Tridentine reforms, but also allowed the Jesuits, the most hated enemies of the Reformers, to enter Poland. While still in Poland, on the recommendation of Charles Borromeo, Commendone was created cardinal on 12 March 1565. He remained in Poland until the death of Pius IV (9 December 1565), and before returning to Italy he went as legate of the new pope, Pope Pius V, to the Diet of Augsburg, which was opened by Emperor Maximilian II on 23 March 1566. He had previously warned the emperor under pain of excommunication not to discuss religion at the diet. He also seized the opportunity to exhort the assembled Estates to carry into execution the Tridentine decrees. In September 1568, Pius V sent him a second time as legate to Maximilian II. With Biglia, the resident nuncio at Vienna, he was to induce the emperor to make no new religious concessions to the Protestant Estates of Lower Austria and to recall several concessions which he had already made. While engaged in this mission, Commendone was also empowered by a papal Brief dated 10 October 1568, to make an apostolic visitation of the churches and monasteries of Germany and the adjacent provinces. An account of this visitation in the diocese of Passau and diocese of Salzburg in the year 1569 is published in \\"Studien und Mittheilungen aus dem Benedictiner und Cistercienser Orden\\" (Br√ºnn, 1893, XIV, 385-398 and 567-589). In November 1571, Pius V sent him as legate to the emperor and to King Sigismund of Poland in the interest of a crusade. After the death of King Sigismund, in 1572, he promoted the election of Henry, Duke of Anjou, as King of Poland, thereby incurring the displeasure of the emperor. Upon his return to Italy in 1573, Pope Gregory XIII appointed him a member of the newly founded Congregatio Germanica, the purpose of which was to safeguard Catholic interests in Germany. When Gregory XIII fell dangerously ill, it was generally believed that Commendone would be elected pope, but he was outlived by Gregory. He died at Padua.

He lectured on art at Harvard University, and taught modeling at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League of New York. He served as Curator of Sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art until he was ousted in 1905\\"Museum's Trustees Oust Curator Elwell,\\" The New York Times, October 17, 1905., and wrote one of the first, though unpublished, histories of American sculpture.Thayer Tolles, ed., American Sculpture in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume I (New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1999), pp. 365-366. Elwell established an early reputation as a sculptor of portrait busts, but also became known for major works, funereal and military monuments, and architectural sculptures. His most famous work is probably Dickens and Little Nell (1890). Biography =Early life= Elwell was the son and only child of John Wesley Elwell and Clara Farrar, of Concord, Massachusetts. He was orphaned at age 4, and raised by his maternal grandparents, Elisha Jones Farrar and Elizabeth Chase Barnay. His grandfather was a blacksmith, whom Elwell assisted at the forge. The Farrars were friendly with several illustrious neighbors: Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and the Alcott family. He attended Concord public schools, and received his first art instruction privately from Abigail May Alcott, who had been an early teacher of sculptor Daniel Chester French. Levi P. Morton bust in the U.S. Senate Her sister, writer Louisa May Alcott, took an interest in both students. As a teenager, Elwell assisted French (eight years his senior) in the sculptor's Concord studio, and later shared a studio with him in New York City. Elwell studied at the school of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. With financial backing from French, the Alcotts, and other Boston patrons, Elwell traveled to Paris in 1881. Following a recommendation from the U.S. Minister to France, Levi P. Morton, he was admitted to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in May 1882. He matriculated after a year, and studied privately in the studio of his √âcole teacher, Alexandre Falgui√®re. Elwell then studied architecture at the Royal Art School in Ghent, Belgium, and was awarded a silver medal by King Leopold in 1884. Elwell married fellow American art student Molina Mary Hilbreth in Paris.John William Leonard, ed., Who's Who in New York City and State (New York: L. R. Hamersly Company, second edition, 1905), p. 308. They returned to Massachusetts in 1885, and their twin sons were born there in 1886. = Career = For several years, Elwell lectured on art at Harvard University. He taught modeling at the school of the National Academy of Design, 1886-1887, then at the Art Students League of New York. He found early success in modeling and carving portrait busts and minor works. His first major commission came in 1886 from Mrs. Frederik Hendrik Pont, a Dutch philanthropist, for a sculpture to mark her late husband's grave. The widow chose Elwell after his having been recommended by Dutch painter Hendrik Dirk Kruseman van Elten and American sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward. Carved in marble, Death of Strength (1888) depicted a dying lion watched over by an angel. It was placed in the churchyard of St. Nicholaaskerk, in Edam, Netherlands, becoming \\"the first American-made statue to be installed on European soil.\\" =Dickens and Little Nell= Elwell's most celebrated work is likely his 1891 sculptural grouping of Charles Dickens and Nell Trent, a character from the author's 1840-41 novel The Old Curiosity Shop. It won a gold medal from the Art Club of Philadelphia in 1891 and two gold medals at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The New York Times wrote, \\"Among the art exhibits of this country at the World's Fair, probably no particular example has attracted more popular interest than the sculptural memorial to Charles Dickens, the work of Mr. F. Edwin Elwell, a young artist\\". Lorado Taft wrote in his 1903 book The History of American Sculpture: > In his \\"Dickens and Little Nell\\" the sculptor has given us that rare thing, > --a portrait statue which makes an emotional appeal. To be sure, its > dramatic power is due to a secondary figure, as is the case in Mr. French's > \\"Gallaudet,\\" but the use of such a figure is legitimate when it detracts > nothing from the effect of the principal, but rather enhances it, and when > it is in itself as charming in conception as is Mr. Elwell's \\"Little Nell.\\" =1901 Pan-American Exposition= Kronos (1901), Fountain sculpture for the Pan-American Exposition, Buffalo, New York. Elwell created three heroic-sized sculptures for the 1901 Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York. Kronos and Ceres faced each other across the pool of the West Esplanade Fountain; and Intelligence had the place of honor before the south portico of the New York State Building (now the Albright-Knox Art Gallery).The American Architect and Building News, vol. 71, no. 1310 (February 2, 1901). Elwell exhibited two bronzes in the Art Gallery, Egypt Awakening and Dancing Girl, and was awarded a Bronze Medal for them.Pan-American Exposition, Catalogue of the Exhibition of Fine Arts (Buffalo, NY: Davis Gray, publisher, 1901), p. 68. His twin sons entered Harvard University in 1906, and Elwell donated his plaster model of Kronos: > At the reception to Freshmen in the Union last night, a statue of \\"Kronos,\\" > designed by F. E. Elwell, and presented to the Union by A. F. Elwell '10 and > S. B. Elwell '10, was unveiled in the southwest corner of the Living Room. > Mr. W. C.

Kronos is represented with out- > stretched wings, symbolic of the apparently swift flight of time, but > standing on the back of a turtle, as significant of its slow progress. The > face is covered with a veil, emblematic of mystery.The Harvard Crimson > December 20, 1906. =Personal= On October 30, 1882, Elwell and Molina Mary Hildreth (1847-1932), of Cambridge, Massachusetts, were married in Paris. They returned to the United States in 1885, and the following year she bore twin sons: Alcott Farrar Elwell (1886-1962) and Stanley Bruce Elwell (1886-1936). Louisa May Alcott was godmother to Alcott Elwell. Elwell presented a bust of Louisa May Alcott to the University of Kansas in 1900: > Miss Alcott was so much my friend, and had so much to do in forming my > character that I would have been most ungrateful had I not sought to honor > her memory when the opportunity was afforded, as it came in an invitation to > furnish a bust for the University of Kansas. ‚Ä¶ [Presented] as a loving > tribute to the memory of a grand woman whose friendship was so helpful, and > whose writings have tended to ennoble and elevate the lives of thousands of > American boys and girls.Josephine Latham Swayne, The Story of Concord Told > by Concord Writers (Boston: E. F. Worcester Press, 1906), p. 235. Frank and Molina Elwell separated around 1908, and their 1911 divorce was highly publicized. Elwell lived for a time in Orange, New Jersey, and then for many years lived and sculpted at 12 Hudson Place in Weehawken, New Jersey, overlooking the Hudson River. He moved to Darien, Connecticut, in 1920. Elwell died there on January 23, 1922, while waiting for a streetcar. The city flew its flags at half-mast.

With a libretto and d√©cor by Comte √âtienne de Beaumont and costumes executed by Barbara Karinska, it was first presented by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo at the Th√©√¢tre de Monte Carlo on 5 April 1938.Jack Anderson, The One and Only: The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo (New York: Dance Horizons, 1981), p. 281.Frederic Franklin, interviewed by John Mueller, Cincinnati, Ohio, October 2004; bonus material on Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, a film (1954) by Victor Jessen on DVD (Pleasantville, N.Y.: Video Artists International, 2006). Synopsis Performed in one act, the ballet does not have a conventional narrative. Instead, it depicts the amorous flirtations, convivial dancing, and high spirits of a diverse group of people who patronize a fashionable Paris caf√© one evening during the period of the Second Empire (1851‚Äì1870). Members of various social classes are among the participants. As the curtain opens, four waiters and four cleaning women are preparing the room for the evening's entertainment. They dance a merry dance before the doors are opened to the public. The first to arrive is a pretty Flower Girl, who has come to sell her nosegays to the customers. She dances happily with the waiters, flouncing her skirts and petticoats, as the charladies depart. Next to enter is a gaggle of six cocodettes, flighty young women of questionable virtue, with three billiards players as their escorts. The group dances about the room in a rousing mazurka. At its conclusion, a glamorous Glove Seller appears in the doorway and waltzes into the room, charming everyone there. A change of music announces the arrival of a wealthy Peruvian tourist, who enters in a state of high excitement. Bearing two carpetbags, he is so eager to join the Parisian nightlife that he has not stopped to deposit his luggage. The cocodettes are interested in him, and in his apparent wealth, but he is attracted to the Glove Seller. Next, to the strains of a swelling waltz, a handsome Baron enters. He is welcomed by the Flower Girl, but he is immediately captivated by the Glove Seller. When they dance together, they seem to form a perfect partnership. Drum beats and march music then signal the arrival of an Officer and a platoon of soldiers. On the lookout for girls, the soldiers engage the cocodettes and the Flower Girl in another dance. Suddenly, a fashionable society beauty, a courtesan known as La Lionne, arrives, accompanied by her escort, a Duke, and a companion, the Lady in Green. The room is now filled with people seeking an evening's diversion, entertainment, and, possibly, amorous adventure. La Lionne, in a bright red ball gown, becomes the center of attraction. She vies for the attention of the Officer, who flirts with the Glove Seller, who contrives to make the Baron jealous by pretending to respond to the attention of the Peruvian. The Duke is disconcerted by the behavior of La Lionne, but he is also interested in the Glove Seller, and he joins the Officer, the Baron, and the Peruvian in wooing her in a vivacious pas de cinq, lifting her high above their heads and exposing her pretty legs. A quarrel develops among the four men and a fight breaks out. The Baron and the Glove Seller escape the m√™l√©e, but almost everyone else joins in. After order is restored and everyone has left the room, the Baron and the Glove Seller return and dance an exuberant, romantic waltz, with aerial lifts and swooping turns. At its conclusion, a troupe of can-can dancers enters, led by a Dancing Master. They dance a lively can-can with the traditional high kicks, dizzying spins, whirling turns, and much display of ruffled skirts, black garters, and frothy white underthings. At the height of the ensuing merriment, everyone joins in a boistrous ballabile. Thereafter, the mood softens; the lights dim, and to the strains of a gentle barcarole, everyone prepares to leave. Some of the guests pair off. La Lionne departs with the Officer, the Flower Girl leaves with the Duke, and others slowly drift out into the night. The Peruvian returns, expecting to find the Glove Seller waiting for him. Instead, he discovers her and the Baron in a passionate embrace. From the dusky doorway, they wave farewell to him as he is left alone in a spotlight, slumped over, drained of energy, disappointed by the outcome of the evening. The curtain closes.George Balanchine and Francis Mason, \\"Ga√Æt√© Parisienne,\\" in 101 Stories of the Great Ballets (New York: Doubleday, 1989), pp. 183‚Äì86.Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, a film (1954) by Victor Jessen on DVD (2006). Original cast At the premiere, the role of the Glove Seller was danced by Nina Tarakanova, the Flower Girl was Eugenia Delarova, and La Lionne was portrayed by Jeannette Lauret. Frederic Franklin took the part of the Baron, Igor Youskevitch was the Officer, and Massine himself danced the major comedy role of the Peruvian.Balanchine and Mason, 101 Stories of the Great Ballets (1989), p. 183. Lubov Roudenko had a specially choreographed Can-Can routine, later reprising this for the 1941 film. History Before the opening night, the ballet was advertised under the tentative titles of Gay Mabille and Tortoni, after a Paris caf√©, but Manuel Rosenthal recalled that Count √âtienne de Beaumont, the ballet's librettist, eventually came up with the title that was used at the premiere.Martin Anderson, \\"A Century in Music: Manuel Rosenthal in Conversation,\\" Tempo (April 2000), new ser. (212): pp. 31-37. Massine had originally commissioned this ballet from Roger D√©sormi√®re, but, owing to lack of time,Anderson, Tempo (April 2000). he asked his friend Rosenthal to take on the commission. Initially not inclined to fulfill the assignment, Rosenthal reportedly said, \\"I don't know Offenbach well; I'm not used to orchestrating the music of other people; I don't want to do it; I don't know Miasine [Massine]\\". However, D√©sormi√®re was insistent enough that Rosenthal eventually accepted the task. With advice from Nadia Boulanger, Massine directed Rosenthal's selection of the Offenbach excerpts. After completion of the score, Massine was unsure about it and was inclined to reject it. Rosenthal then proposed that Igor Stravinsky act as arbitrator over the acceptance of the score, to which Massine agreed. Upon hearing the music, Stravinsky strongly advised Massine to accept Rosenthal's arrangements. However, because of the poor relations between Massine and Rosenthal, Rosenthal himself did not conduct the first performance of the ballet, and instead Efrem Kurtz was conductor for the ballet's premiere.Leslie Norton, L√©onide Massine and the 20th Century Ballet (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004). Ga√Æt√© Parisienne was first presented in the United States by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, on 12 October 1938, with Alexandra Danilova as the Glove Seller and Delarova, Lauret, Franklin, Youskevitch, and Massine in the same roles they had danced at the premiere in Monte Carlo.Balanchine and Mason, 101 Stories of the Great Ballets (19889), p. 183). Danilova, who had shared the role of the Glove Seller with Tarakanova in Europe, became indelibly associated with the role in America. Unlike Tarakanova, who had played the Glove Seller as demure and naive, Danilova portrayed her as a vivacious, glamorous, sophisticated woman of the world.Franklin, interview (2004), Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, a film (1954) by Victor Jessen on DVD (2006). As Jack Anderson wrote in The One and Only, \\"Danilova in Ga√Æt√© became one of the attractions of the Ballet Russe, and the ballet often concluded a season's opening-night performance. On the opening night of the company's 1941 season in New York, when Danilova made her first entrance she was given a spontaneous ovation that stopped the show. Such show-stopping ovations thenceforth became a tradition of every opening-night Ga√Æt√© with Danilova.\\"Anderson, The One and Only (Dance Books, 1989), p. 18. The charming role of the Flower Girl was choreographed especially to suit the talents and abilities of Eugenia Delarova, Massine's second wife, and she was ideally suited to its exuberant lyricism. Frederic Franklin, young, blond, and handsome, was perfectly cast as the Baron and was long known for that role. Jeannette Lauret, a statuesque dancer with sparkling eyes, was also particularly admired as La Lionne, which she performed many times. After Massine left the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1943, Leon Danielian eventually inherited the role of the Peruvian and became closely identified with it. Over time, he altered the original choreography to suit his personal styleFranklin, commentator, Ga√Æt√© Parisienne, a film (1954) by Victor Jessen on DVD (2006). and was much admired in the role. Other productions of Massine's Ga√Æt√© Parisienne were mounted by the Royal Swedish Ballet (1956), American Ballet Theatre (1970), London Festival Ballet (1973), and Les Ballets de Monte Carlo (1989).Janet Sinclair, \\"Ga√Æt√© Parisienne,\\" in International Dictionary of Ballet, edited by Martha Bremser (Detroit: St. James Press, 1993), vol. 1, p. 540. Lorca Massine staged a revival of his father's ballet for American Ballet Theatre in 1988, with cartoonish sets by Zack Brown and extravagantly patterned and colorful costumes by French fashion designer Christian Lacroix.Nancy Vreeland Dalva, \\"Ga√ét√© Tr√®s Parisienne,\\" Dance Magazine (New York) (May 1988), pp. 52‚Äì55. The production was not a success and was performed only sporadically until 1999, when it was dropped from the repertory. It returned for a few performances in 2014 during the company's New York season, once again meeting with only a tepid response from audiences and critics.Brian Seibert, \\"The Parisian Life Beckons, Waiting to Become Unforgettable,\\" The New York Times (21 May 2014).

Efrem Kurtz, who conducted the world premiere, recorded some of the music for Columbia Records on 78-rpm discs. In 1947, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the ballet for RCA Victor; this high fidelity recording was later issued by RCA as its first 33-1/3 rpm LP in 1950. In 1954, Fiedler recorded the concert suite in stereo, his first stereophonic session for RCA. Charles Munch also recorded the ballet for Decca as part of the Phase 4 Stereo series, as did Leonard Bernstein for Columbia. Ren√© Leibowitz and the London Philharmonic recorded it in stereo for Urania. Rosenthal himself made four recordings of the ballet. In 1941, Warner Brothers produced a Technicolor film version of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo production of Ga√Æt√© Parisienne that it released in 1942, under the title The Gay Parisian. Directed by Jean Negulesco, it departs considerably from the original scenario of the ballet. The unit set, which was designed to conform to Hollywood's idea of elegant architecture, including a typical \\"stairway to nowhere,\\" bears no resemblance to a room in a Parisian nightclub or caf√© of the Second Empire. Many costumes were redesigned to be somewhat more modest than those seen on the ballet stage, but they were realized in startlingly garish colors to take advantage of the Technicolor process. Further, Massine cut much of his choreography to achieve the desired twenty-minute length and restaged what was left for the movie camera. The result was to focus the work on the role of the Peruvian, played by himself. Besides the loss of some of the most entertaining dances, his changes also obscured the relationships of the characters. The cast also includes Frederic Franklin as the Baron, Nathalie Krassovska as the Flower Girl, Igor Youskevitch as the Officer, and Andr√© Eglevsky as the Dancing Master. The film is commercially available only as a bonus feature on the \\"three-disc special edition\\" of The Maltese Falcon issued in 2006 by Warner Home Video. In 1954, Victor Jessen created a black-and-white film of Ga√Æt√© Parisienne by laboriously splicing together strips of film he had surreptitiously recorded in theaters during performances by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo over a ten-year period (1944‚Äì1954) and then editing the footage to conform to a sound recording he had also secretly made during a performance sometime around 1954. The synchronization of sound and picture is not exact. Issued on DVD in 2006 by Video Artists International, the film stars Danilova as the Glove Seller, Franklin as the Baron, and Leon Danielian as the Peruvian. Featured performers are Tatiana Grantzeva as the Flower Girl, Robert Lindgren as the Officer, Shirley Haynes as La Lionne, Peter Deign as the Duke, Harding Dorn as the Dancing Master, and Moscelyne Larkin and Gertrude Tyven as the lead can-can girl. Optional features include audio commentary by Frederic Franklin and explanatory English subtitles.

It is operated by Infraero. History Corumb√° International Airport the second most important airport of Mato Grosso do Sul, just behind Campo Grande International Airport. Built on a site of 290 ha, it has capacity for medium size planes as a Boeing 737 and Fokker 100. The airport was one of the first to be built outside Brazilian main centers. On September 8, 1933 Syndicato Condor established services between Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, Corumb√° and Cuiab√° with wheeled tri-engine Junkers 52. This service was a major break- through because previously an overland journey to Mato Grosso took several days. In 1936 Condor made an interline agreement with Lloyd A√©reo Boliviano ‚Äì LAB and established an international connection to the main cities of Bolivia, via Puerto Su√°rez and Santa Cruz de la Sierra, using Corumb√° as connecting point. The aircraft of Condor and LAB met in Corumb√° during the overnight stop and exchanged passengers. Furthermore, the services between Corumb√° and Cuiab√° were operated with single-engine flying boat Junkers. The connection between S√£o Paulo and Corumb√° was completed in 6 to 7 hours, and on the next day the hydroplane would make the Corumb√°/Cuiab√° route, returning on the following day. This wait plus the connecting services with LAB forced the tri-engine Junkers 52 to wait for more than two days in Corumb√° to return to S√£o Paulo. For this reason, in 1937 the federal government built by the air-strip a hangar with a width of 35 meters to shelter the repair work of the Junkers that had nearly 30 meters of wingspan. The hangar built with concrete and wood planks had small workshops and a passenger lobby. On September 21, 1960 the present terminal was opened and in 1999 the whole airport complex was expanded: the passenger terminal was enlarged from 1,600m¬≤ to 2,400m¬≤, and the runway from 1,660x30m to 2,000x45m. In 2007 it received some repairs and further expansion. Airlines and destinations No scheduled flights operate at this airport.

Others had moved to Slovenia from other parts of Yugoslavia before the country‚Äôs dissolution, and remained there after 1991. Slovenia: The ‚Äòerased‚Äô - Briefing to the UN Committeeon Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Amnesty International, 28 November 2005, page 2.  History  In 1991, immediately after the declaration of independence by Slovenia, the approximately 200,000 residents of Slovenia who had citizenship of other republics of former Yugoslavia were granted the possibility to obtain, through an application, the citizenship of the new independent state. For those who would have chosen not to avail themselves of this possibility, the law required to register as \\"foreign\\" (a term denoting legal permanent residents without citizenship). Approximately 170,000 individuals presented the application, obtaining citizenship before the national elections in 1992. Some thousands chose the second option. The majority of those who, contrary to legal provisions, did not register themselves as \\"foreigners\\" were removed from the registry of Permanent Residence in February 1992, losing all social, civil, and political rights. This action was of purely administrative nature (and thus excluded any possibility of appeal) and struck, according to unofficial estimates, over 18,000 people, including some who had actually left the country, while others were simply unaware of the existence of the law that required them to confirm their status through a new application. In 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the act of \\"erasing\\" illegal and unconstitutional, and annulled its legal consequences. In the same year the Slovenian Parliament promulgated a law that offered the \\"erased\\" the opportunity to regain residence, but only to those who lived permanently in Slovenian territory. The Constitutional Court abrogated this law as another attempt in the same direction. In 2003 the Court declared unconstitutional the 1992 Law that required residents with Slovenian citizenship of other Yugoslav republics to explicitly ask to obtain the status of \\"alien\\", and ordered the return of the status of residents at all \\"erased\\" with retroactive function (regardless of whether they actually did not live in Slovenia after 1992). Many lawyers (among others some former members of the Constitutional Court and several authors of the Constitution) harshly criticized this decision, since it annulled a legal provision included in the country's constitutional laws and thus, according to them, beyond the Court's jurisdiction. The decision was followed by a harsh and lasting controversy, in which the LDS-led government gradually accepted the decisions taken by the Constitutional Court, while the opposition (SDS, N.Si, SLS and SNS) continued to criticize it. In February 2004, the parliamentary majority passed a law in accordance with the decision of the Court (which provided for the retroactivity only for those who were already in possession of residence); two months later, however, this law (called \\"Technical Law on the erased\\") was annulled by a referendum (supported by the centre-right opposition). This referendum was strongly contested by some institutions of the European Union. As of 2007 the number of the \\"erased\\" was imprecise, with the group fragmented into different legal categories: some have regained residency and citizenship, some only residence, some were expelled, many of them are living in Slovenia illegally. According to some estimates there are still 6,000 people without legal status, while many of those who managed to get the right to permanent residency had to pay heavily for the consequences of years of irregularities. The issue was brought before the European Commission, which stated that it does not have jurisdiction over such matter. Some of the affected made a collective appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, claiming that \\"The cancellation is a European problem, because it violates fundamental human rights provided by the EU Convention.\\" In 2012 the Grand Chamber of the ECHR decided the case (Kuriƒá and Others v. Slovenia) in favour of the applicants (several of the \\"erased\\"). In 2005, and again in 2007, the SDS-led government proposed the regulation of the status of the \\"erased\\" by a Constitutional law that would treat each case individually. On both occasions, this compromise was rejected by the centre-left opposition. An article from 2013 published by B92 stated that over 26,000 people had their residence rights taken away in February 1992, ending up in a situation \\"worse than refugees\\", since they had no possibilities for work and social protection. Literature *Erased is a novel by Miha Mazzini, published in Slovenia in 2014, about a woman who was one of the Erased. Film *Erased is a 2019 film, directed by Miha Mazzini.

History In 1967, Ray Scott of Trinity, Texas launched the concept of competitive bass fishing by forming the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society. Scott‚Äôs mark on the sport came from his creation of the first professional tournament circuit, and from the organization of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (B.A.S.S.) in 1968. The magazine and B.A.S.S.‚Äôs publicity machine made heroes out of the emerging bass fishing ‚Äúprofessionals.‚Äù Bill Dance, Roland Martin, Tom Mann and John Powell began winning often enough to attract sponsor contracts that enabled them to fish for a living. Bassmaster also taught America‚Äôs anglers how to catch bass throughout the year, and it introduced them to new lures, tackle, electronic fishfinders and fast, sleek bass boats. Always looking for a competitive advantage, the touring pros demanded the best and most effective rods, reels and other gear, and their fans snapped up angler-endorsed products as fast as they could be packaged and labeled. The list of improvements and inventions attributable to B.A.S.S. tournament competition is long. It includes fluorocarbon and braided superline, aerated livewells, digital sonar and GPS, graphite rods, performance bass boats, high- speed and low-profile casting reels, automatically inflatable life preservers, remote-control anchors, foot-operated trolling motors guided by GPS positioning systems and many, many more. Beginning in 1968 and continuing rapidly over the next few decades, bass fishing evolved from a lazy pastime to a multibillion-dollar industry employing thousands of people. The black bass became the No. 1 gamefish in the United States, and its popularity spread rapidly to every continent except Antarctica. B.A.S.S. and its membership publication, Bassmaster Magazine, marked their 50th anniversaries in 2018. B.A.S.S. celebrated the 50th Bassmaster Classic March 6-8, 2020, on Lake Guntersville, Alabama, with weigh-ins in Birmingham. Since its humble debut in 1971 at Lake Mead, Nevada, the Classic has become widely known as the ‚ÄúSuper Bowl of Bass Fishing,‚Äù and the single most important event of the year in the world of bass fishing.

Federation tournament was held in June 1967 on Beaver Lake, Arkansas. A total of 106 anglers from thirteen different states competed. In that All-American Bass Tournament, Scott charged a $100 entry fee with a chance to win $2,000 and a trip to Acapulco, Mexico. The winner of this first tournament was Stan Sloan. Scott staged the first Bassmaster Classic in 1971 at Lake Mead, Nevada ‚Äî though competitors didn't know the location until they were in an aircraft bound for Las Vegas. The \\"mystery lake\\" practice continued through 1976; the following year Scott announced the venue in advance so that fans could make plans to attend the event. Since then, the final weigh-in events, and fishing expositions held together with those events, have become huge spectator events filling large arenas and being broadcast live on ESPN. Below are several B.A.S.S tournament series: =Bassmaster Classic= The Bassmaster Classic is considered the \\"Super Bowl of fishing\\". This world championship event is held once every year and has become a fan favorite. This tournament has a first place prize of $300,000 USD. =Bassmaster Elite Series= This series typically has nine tournaments per season with each winner receiving $100,000. This makes up bass fishing's most lucrative competitive league. This series schedule runs from coast to coast through all phases of the seasons of bass fishing. =Bassmaster Opens= This series sets a platform for amateur anglers to emerge as aspiring pros. Both boaters and non-boaters compete in the Bassmaster Opens, which provides advancement to the Bassmaster Elite Series. Also, an automatic entry to the next years Bassmaster Classic is awarded to the winner of each Bassmaster Open event however in addition they must fish all three Open events in their division to qualify. =B.A.S.S. Nation= Formerly the B.A.S.S. Federation Nation, the name was changed to B.A.S.S. Nation at the beginning of the 2013 season. B.A.S.S. Nation is composed of bass tournament clubs throughout the country. They provide the opportunity for anglers to compete in bass tournaments at a local level as well as different state and national tournaments culminating in the opportunity to fish the Bassmaster Classic.

For many years, the museum was opened only for three hours each year- on the Martyrs' Day of 19 July, from 9 am to 4 pm. The restriction is in line with the current military government's policy of restricting any mention of Gen. Aung San in the media in order to marginalize Aung San Suu Kyi.

Today, the site is the location of the nine-acre Arsenal Park in the Central Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2012, officials from the Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation began drawing attention to the deteriorating arsenal structures. History and use The Arsenal was established by the U.S. Army Ordnance Department near Pittsburgh in 1814. It was situated on of land bordering the Allegheny River in the community of Lawrenceville. The arsenal served as a supply and manufacturing center for the troops in the west. Its peak years came during the Civil War, especially when the manufacture of cartridges, became a high priority. Civilian employment at the arsenal increased from a pre-war total of 308 to over 1100 workers. One of the busiest facilities was the main lab, which employed 158 workers, the majority of whom were women engaged in the making of cartridges. Explosion On Wednesday, September 17, 1862, around 2 pm, the arsenal exploded. The explosion shattered windows in the surrounding community and was heard in Pittsburgh, over two miles (3 km) away. At the sound of the first explosion, Col. John Symington, Commander of the Arsenal, rushed from his quarters and made his way up the hillside to the lab. As he approached, he heard the sound of a second explosion, followed by a third. Fire fighting equipment as well as a bucket brigade tried to douse the flames with water. The volunteer fire company from Pittsburgh arrived and assisted in bringing the fire under control. By the time the fire was put out, the lab had been reduced to a pile of smoldering rubble. 78 workers, mostly young women, were killed. 54 bodies were unidentified, and were buried in a mass grave in the nearby Allegheny Cemetery. Among those killed were 15-year-old munitions assembler Catherine Burkhart, who lived at 184 38th Street, and 17-year-old Margaret Turney, who lived at 160 43rd Street. Investigation The most commonly held view of the cause of the explosion was that the metal shoe of a horse had struck a spark which touched off loose powder in the roadway near the lab, which then traveled up onto the porch where it set off several barrels of gunpowder. A coroner's jury held that the accident had been the result of the negligent conduct of Col. John Symington and his subordinates in allowing loose powder to accumulate on the roadway and elsewhere. However, during a subsequent military inquiry into the conduct of Col. Symington, many of the same witnesses who had appeared before the coroner changed their testimony. There were so many discrepancies between the two hearings that most of the commonly held views of the explosion have been shown to be thoroughly discredited. In the end Col. Symington was found innocent of any wrongdoing by the army, and the court concluded that \\"the cause of the explosion could not be satisfactorily ascertained....\\" Col. Symington, in a letter to the Ordnance Department two days after the explosion, speculated that it had been caused \\"by the leaking out of powder when one of the barrels was being placed on the platform.\\" In fact the problem of leaking barrels seemed to be the one point of agreement among all the witnesses. Alexander McBride, the Superintendent of the Lab, had repeatedly complained that the powder shipped by Dupont and Company was delivered in defective barrels with loose covers. Symington was suspicious that the \\"parties shipping powder may have used barrels more than once for the shipment of powder, as the barrels have been returned to them at their request.\\" But in the end, the final word still belongs to the Army inquiry and the exact cause remains unknown. Symington himself was sent on retirement the next year. Allegheny Arsenal Powder Magazine, built 1814, perhaps the only original portion of the former arsenal still intact. Aftermath The explosion at the Arsenal was overshadowed by the Battle of Antietam, which occurred on the same day near the town of Sharpsburg, Maryland. Work at the Arsenal continued, and a new lab was constructed by the following year. After the war, the Allegheny Arsenal served primarily as a storage facility for the Ordnance Department and Quartermaster Corps. In the 1900s most of the land was sold off. Today the site of the explosion is in a ballfield in Arsenal Park. Nearby is the powder magazine, now a maintenance shed for the park. See also *Brown's Island, Richmond, Virginia.

History The area of Philomath was first called Woodstock in the 1790s and was briefly the county seat during that decade. It experienced a population decline after the move, but started to be settled again circa 1829. The nearest post office was a stage coach stop between Atlanta and Augusta about four miles away. The people of Woodstock wanted their own post office. When the approval for one came, the name had to be changed because there was another Woodstock in Georgia. The city was home to an all-boys boarding school, Reid Academy, to which boys came from all over the South to attend. The school was known throughout the state as one of the finest educational institutions of its time.Nelda Vaughn, Philomath, Philomath, Georgia: 1972 Robert Toombs and Alexander Stephens were frequent visitors to the city and often made speeches at the school. Stephens suggested that the city‚Äôs name should be changed to Philomath which means a place of learning, because the school was such an important aspect to the community.Lena Smith Wise, The Story of Oglethorpe County, Lexington, Georgia: 1980 Much of the early history of Philomath was centered on the Academy. The school buildings were eventually torn down and replaced with a one-story building, which was used as a community school until recent years when the students began to be transported to larger schools. The building was then converted into a community center. Philomath is mentioned in the 1985 R.E.M song \\"Cant Get There from Here\\", with singer Michael Stipe singing the lines \\"If you're needing inspiration, Philomath is where I go by dawn‚Äù and ‚ÄúPhilomath they know the low-down.‚Äù However, Stipe claims he's never been there. The liner notes for the band's Eponymous compilation album identify Philomath as \\"located between Lexington and Crawfordville and used to have its own post office.\\" Philomath is mentioned in John McPhee's essay \\"Travels in Georgia\\" which appeared in the collection \\"Pieces of the frame\\". At the time of that writing (1973), Philomath's zip code was 30659. Historical buildings A large number of cotton plantations were laid out in and around Philomath, the oldest of which is called \\"The Globe\\".Cary Fordyce, Philomath National Register Historic District. Georgia, 30 June 2006 A Presbyterian church was erected circa 1840, which still stands. On one plantation, there is a clay pit (called the Great Buffalo Lick) which was used by the Cherokee and Creek peoples as a boundary to transfer land to the state of Georgia during James Wright's term as governor. There was more recently an attempt to register the above mentioned Buffalo Lick as a Georgia Natural Area. Many Native American trails run through this land.

The Parting of Soldiers Philomath was the location of the final breaking up of the Confederate government east of the Mississippi. President Davis and his cabinet separated in Washington, Georgia because they thought it was best for him to travel inconspicuously. His cabinet met at the home of Captain John J. Daniel. General Breckinridge and General Duke, who were bodyguards to President Davis in his flight from Richmond, were in command. It was decided that it was a \\"needless expenditure of blood to continue the struggle and the Stars and Bars of the late Confederacy were forever furled.\\"Vaughn, op. cit.

Vachara Dada, also spelled as Vachhra Dada or Vasra Dada, also known as Vachchhraj Dada or Vatsaraj is a folk deity of Gujarat state in India. He is an eminent warrior-hero of the region. Hindus and Muslims alike honor him. Legends According to folk tales, Vatsarajsinh Solanki or Vachhara was a son of Thakhatsinh Solanki and Akalba. He belonged to caste of Solanki Rajput ruler named Chachak in Kathiawar, who ruled from Kalri, presently located in Mehsana district. One day he was getting married, when he was taking the feras, he heard the news that some dacoits were looting and taking the cows of village. He left the marriage ceremony in the middle to fight the plunderers, in which he attained martyrdom. According to the legend, it is believed that Vachhara's head was severed in the fight by sword of an enemy, but even after that his body fought against the people and killed them all. In veneration of his heroic sacrifice, a temple was later built in his memory. It is said that Vachara's wife Umade wanted to become a sati but was stopped by saint, who asked her to go to her in-laws house. Vachara was blessed by the God and was asked to consummate the marriage in vayu form. Thus, twenty two sons were born to him, Solanki descendants of whom all worship him as their kuldevta. Mers also worship Vachra Dada and is one of main deity of their caste. Folklore also says that he was reborn seven times, and every time he would do Pheras, he would be interrupted by acts of dacoits taking away the cows. In his seventh life he successfully killed the dacoits. Thus he became a Shurveer in seven cycle of birth as per Hindu myths and became a demi-god after that. Iconography Vachhada Dada is shown sitting on a white Kathiawari horse with a snake at his feet and a flaming sword in his hands. He is worshiped by Khedut' (Gujarati word for a farmer) to protect their cattle and keep their crops thriving and also from protection of snake bites. Many temples and shrines can be found throughout Gujarat devoted to him. Temples The location where he became martyr is also named Vachhara Dada. It is located at edge of Little Rann of Kutch, 35 km from Kuda (near Dhangadhra); 15 km from Vatsrajpur, and 8 km from Zinzuwadia. The place today is a pilgrimage centre and houses the main temple and samadhi of Vachra Dada. 407 km from Zinjuvada, the temple of vachradada is situated at bitta. Ta.

The first album was released on UK label Plankton Records. They are currently signed to Swedish label Endtime Productions (Extol, Antestor, Crimson Moonlight). Drottnar is the plural (sing. Drottinn, Norwegian \\"Drott\\") of an Icelandic word for master, ruler or king. Originally adopting a Viking image, the band is currently known for their peculiar thematics and live shows where they use military uniforms reminiscent of the Soviet style. History The band was originally formed under the name Vitality in 1996 by four Lind siblings: vocalist Sven-Erik Lind, guitarist-keyboardist Karl Fredrik Lind, drummer Glenn-David Lind, and bassist Bjarne Peder Lind. They recorded their first two demos at X-Ray Studios. The first one, titled Doom of Antichrist, was released in May 1996. In 1998, the name was changed to Drottnar and a demo titled A White Realm was recorded in September. In 2000, the band released their demos together as an album titled Spiritual Battle. It was published by UK based label Plankton Records. The demos were remastered for the album, and Spiritual Battle was well received by Cross Rhythms Magazine. A year later, Drottnar entered the studio of Black Woods Productions and recorded a song called \\"Trellebaand Maa Briste\\" for the Swedish label Endtime Productions' compilation album In the Shadow of Death. The band changed its image a bit and used more militant elements such as gas masks as part of its live shows. In 2003, Drottnar recorded an EP titled Anamorphosis on the Norwegian label Momentum Scandinavia. The EP was limited to 850 pieces, and contains an intro and three songs with violins on the intro and other parts. Bass player Bjarne Peder Lind left the band before the album was recorded. Drottnar was joined by guitarist Bengt Olsson and bassist H√•var Wormdahl. Vocalist Sven-Erik Lind wearing a military uniform. In 2005, the band was signed to Endtime Productions, and entered Subsonic Studios to record new material. Some elements such as trumpet were recorded in Ostrava, Czech Republic by Jan-Espen S. Schildmann. In April 2006, the band released an album titled Welterwerk. A 7-inch vinyl single titled Ad Hoc Revolt was also released for promotional purposes. Around the time of the album's release, the band began using early 20th century military regalia as part of their image. Drottnar has performed with bands such as Grimfist and Extol. The band played a short tour in the U.S. in summer 2008, performing at the Cornerstone Festival. On February 1, 2009, the band announced that it was recording a new album. The next day, Drottnar announced the departure of guitarist Bengt Olsson. However, later that year, on August 12, the band announced that Olsson had rejoined Drottnar. Recording continued for the next few years. A single from the album, \\"Lucid Stratum\\", was released on November 8, 2011. On October 13, 2012, the band released the new album, entitled Stratum, in digital format, as well as a music video for the song \\"We March\\". In 2017 the band released the first of a trio of EPs, Monolith I, followed by Monolith II and Monolith III in 2018. All three have met with very positive praise from fans, showcasing a more raw, even more experimental sound than previous material. =Festival performances= Drottnar has played at notable festivals such as Sweden's Endtime Fest, Norway's Nordic Fest, Netherlands' Brainstorm Fest, Switzerland's Elements of Rock, and Finland's Immortal Metal Fest. Lyrics and themes In the beginning the band's lyrics dealt with Christianity with a brutal and extreme approach; the lyrics on the album Spiritual Battle were inspired by the Book of Revelation and dealt mostly with the battle ravaging the spiritual world. The band members have said \\"The Norwegian black metal scene does not influence our lyrics, but the lyrics are still written in a black metal way, fitting our music well.\\" Megaphones are a recognizable element of Drottnar's live shows. Currently Drottnar has had a special feature for several years, the use of Czech or \\"Soviet\\" style elements: the song titles and lyrics contain Soviet-sounding words and metaphors, some songs contain samples of radio play or radio communication elements involved in the 20th century, and at concerts all band members used Soviet uniforms,. The vocalist Sven-Erik Lind typically uses effects such as megaphones to create a military atmosphere. =Musical style= Drottnar's general style has been described as black metal, death/doom, and Folk metal. On Spiritual Battle, the band was compared to Groms, Extol, and Antestor, and Sven-Erik used a vocal style ranging from growling to a more high-pitched style. With the release of Welterwerk, Drottnar broadened their style, \\"aiming somewhere between Atheist, Extol, and the most complex Mayhem material and almost hitting the mark.\\" Discography Drottnar live in 2013. ;Albums * Welterwerk (2006, Endtime Productions) * Stratum (2012, Endtime Productions) * Monolith (2019, Endtime Productions) ;Singles * \\"Lucid Stratum\\" Single (2011, Endtime Productions) * \\"Wolves and Lambs' Single (2016, Endtime Productions) ;Extended Plays * Anamorphosis EP (2003, Momentum Scandinavia) * Ad Hoc Revolt 7\\" EP (2006, Endtime Productions) * Monolith I EP (2017, Endtime Productions) * Monolith II EP (2018, Endtime Productions) * Monolith III EP (2018, Endtime Productions) ;Demo * Doom of Antichrist (Demo, 1997) as Vitality * Demo 96/97 (Demo, 1997) as Vitality * A White Realm (Demo, 1998) ;Compilation * Spiritual Battle (Compilation, 2000, Plankton Records) Members ;Current lineup *Karl Fredrik Lind - guitar/vocals *H√•var Wormdahl - bass guitar *Glenn-David Lind - drums ;Former members *Sven-Erik Lind - vocals *Bengt Olsson - guitar *Bjarne Peder Lind - bass guitar Notes =References= External links * Official website Norwegian unblack metal musical groups Norwegian death metal musical groups Norwegian doom metal musical groups Norwegian viking metal musical groups Musical groups established in 1996 1996 establishments in Norway Musical groups from Fredrikstad ","title":"Drottnar"},{"id":"14333908","text":"Dor√© Records (pronounced \\"dorrie\\") was a record label founded in Los Angeles, California, in 1958 by Lew (or Lou) Bedell and his cousin Herb Newman.

It is part of the New Castle Community School Corporation and has an enrollment of approximately 1,200 students. NCHS is the largest high school in Henry County. The present high school originated from the New Castle Academy in 1870. In 1895, New Castle High School was constructed. Because of its distinctive appearance, the building became known as \\"The Castle.\\" In response to a significant increase in enrollment, a new senior high school was constructed in 1923‚Äì24 at 14th and Walnut Streets. Plans to construct an additional wing and a multi-purpose facility were never developed. Instead, physical education classes were conducted at the National Guard Armory across the street and basketball games were played at the YMCA in the \\"Church Street Gym.\\" The Walnut Street location served as the senior high school until 1958 when the present high school facility was completed. The 1924 structure then joined the 1895 \\"Castle\\" building as a junior high school. In 1973, eighth and ninth grade students began attending the newly constructed Parkview Junior High School. The \\"Castle\\" was subsequently demolished, and the Walnut Street school exclusively housed seventh grade students until 1999. The location was home to the Raintree Education Center until 2010; the building was sold to a private owner in 2011. Present location Located just west of Baker Park at the corner of Parkview Drive and Ross Street, the current facility opened in August 1958. The structure was modern for its era and featured an expansive facade of windows on the north and south sides. Two new cafeterias, a business wing, and a vocational wing were in place by the 1960s. Construction of Bundy Auditorium in 1972 as part of the adjoining Parkview Junior High School provided a place for school events and activities. A new swimming facility was put into use at this time. When the current building opened, the school was renamed Walter P. Chrysler Memorial High School, after Chrysler Corporation founder Walter Chrysler. In 1979, the New Castle School Board voted to remove the Chrysler name from the school, but eventually decided to rename it New Castle Chrysler High School. The Chrysler name was eventually dropped from the school, but not until July 1, 2011. The name change had been approved by a 3‚Äì2 vote on November 12, 2007, restoring the school's original name, effective after that year's freshman class graduated in 2011. The New Castle School Board began a $25 million project in 1998 to significantly renovate the high school, add air conditioning, and upgrade its technological infrastructure. The former business wing, or \\"C\\" wing, was demolished to make room for a new entrance and improved parking. A new three- story academic wing was built to provide more classroom space and improved science facilities. In 1999, freshmen students were moved from Parkview Junior High School to the newly expanded high school. During the summer of 2011, most of the vocational (New Castle Area Career) programs that had been formerly housed at the Eder site in Knightstown (Indiana Soldiers' and Sailors' Children's Home campus) were moved primarily into the E and T-wings of New Castle High School. Only the student radio station, WKPW (90.7 FM), remained in Knightstown where it had been moved from the Eder site to Knightstown High School by early 2010. Athletics New Castle High School is a member of the Hoosier Heritage Conference and has programs in football, soccer, cross country, volleyball, tennis, basketball, gymnastics, wrestling, swimming, track, golf, softball, and baseball.

This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate phosphate-lyase (chorismate- forming). This enzyme is also called 5-O-(1-carboxyvinyl)-3-phosphoshikimate phosphate-lyase. This enzyme participates in phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. Chorismate synthase catalyzes the last of the seven steps in the shikimate pathway which is used in prokaryotes, fungi and plants for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids. It catalyzes the 1,4-trans elimination of the phosphate group from 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) to form chorismate which can then be used in phenylalanine, tyrosine or tryptophan biosynthesis. Chorismate synthase requires the presence of a reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMNH2 or FADH2) for its activity. Chorismate synthase from various sources shows a high degree of sequence conservation. It is a protein of about 360 to 400 amino-acid residues. Biological and practical function The shikimate pathway synthesises aromatic amino acids as well as other aromatic compounds that have various involvement with processes such as \\"UV protection, electron transport, signaling, communication, plant defense, and the wound response\\". Moreover, the enzymes catalysing the Shikimate pathway may be potentially useful in the development of new herbicides and antibiotics. This is due to the fact that the shikimate pathway is not present in humans. It is, therefore, an ideal target for herbicides because chemicals used to inhibit the shikimate pathway should not have an effect on humans. Also, the products created by the shikimate pathway are essential to plant life, so, if the function of the pathway is inhibited, this has a fatal effect on the plant. The enzymes in the shikimate pathway, and chorismate synthase specifically,are also considered to be potential targets for new antimicrobial chemotherapy treatments for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This is important since drugs resistant strains of M. tuberculosis continue to emerge. Studies have shown that the \\"shikimate pathway is essential for M. tuberculosis viability\\" making it an attractive target for new antimycobacterial agents. Structural studies As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and . The crystal structure of chorismate synthase is a homotetramer with one FMN molecule non-covalently bound to each of the four monomers. Each monomer is made up of 9 alpha helices and 18 beta strands and the core is assembled in a unique beta-alpha-beta sandwich fold. The active sites for FMN- binding are made up of clusters of flexible loops and the area around these regions have highly positive electromagnetic potential. There are two histidine residues located at the active site which are thought to protonate the reduced flavin molecule and the leaving phosphate group of the substrate. {  shows one of the four monomers that make up the active chorismate synthase molecule interacting with the FMN molecule in Mycobacterium tuberculosis  cartoon structure of one of the monomers present in the chorismate synthase moleucle with FMN molecule shown in green  this shows the interaction between the four monomers creating the chorismate synthase tetramer  complete chorismate synthase tetramer shown interacting with one FMN molecule } Mechanism Reduced flavin (FMN) transfers an electron to the substrate resulting in cleavage of the C--O bond. How this flavin is obtained differs from one organism to another and the process is not completely understood. Following the binding of EPSP, the flavin reaction intermediate is formed, but this process is completed prior to EPSP consumption. After EPSP has been converted to chorismate, and after the phosphate has been released from the enzyme,then the flavin intermediate will decay. The chorismate synthase enzyme can be divided into two categories based on how reduced FMN is obtained. Bifunctional chorismate synthase is present in fungi and require a \\"second enzymatic activity, an NAD(P)H-dependent flavin reductase\\".\\" Monofunctional chorismate synthase is found in plants and E.coli and is only active in an anaerobic environment with \\"chemically or enzymatically reduced flavin\\". There is no net redox change in the reaction. The flavin molecule is not consumed during the reaction and merely acts as a catalyst.

The men recognized that traditional telephone system manufacturers had been largely ignoring the small business market, forcing those companies to settle for scaled down versions of their big business systems. They worked on a system that would be less expensive than a traditional PBX system and could be installed, configured and maintained by its end users.

In November 2006, the company introduced its TalkSwitch VS line, which added new expansion and configuration options. For the first time, customers could set local extensions as either analog or IP, establishing TalkSwitch as one of the first truly hybrid systems on the market. They can be used as standalone devices, or in a network and can combine both traditional telephone lines and VoIP services, using analog and/or IP phones. The company has interoperability partnerships with a number of leading VoIP service providers including Primus, Covad, Bandwidth.com, Broadvoice and SureWest. TalkSwitch was acquired by Fortinet in April 2011, and in 2012 its products are sold as the FortiVoice product line. =Partial list of software products= In April 2007, TalkSwitch introduced its Attendant Console application, the first software application built to augment its line of phone systems. The Attendant Console allows users to monitor and manage calls directly from their PCs, without requiring any additional hardware. In August 2007 the company then launched its Call Reporting Software, which is used to generate detailed reports on all telephone system activity. Every activity on a TalkSwitch system can be tracked and reported on. Users are able to assign built-in account codes so they can accurately bill clients for telephone charges, and management can monitor the real-time call activity of particular departments.

Sport tourism is a fast-growing sector of the global travel industry and equates to $7.68 billion.https://www.sportscommissions.org/Portals/sportscommissions/Documents/About/NASC%20Sports%20Travel%20Industry%20Whitepaper.pdf Classification of sport tourism There are several classifications of sport tourism. Gammon and Robinson suggested that sports tourism can be categorized as Hard Sports Tourism or Soft Sports Tourism, while Gibson suggested that there are three types of sports tourism: Sports Event Tourism, Celebrity and Nostalgia Sport Tourism and Active Sport Tourism. =Hard and soft sport tourism= The \\"hard\\" definition of sport tourism refers to the quantity of people participating at a competitive sport events. Normally these kinds of events are the motivation that attract visitors to the events. Olympic Games, FIFA World Cup, F1 Grand Prix and regional events such as NASCAR Sprint Cup Series could be described as hard sports tourism. The \\"soft\\" definition of sport tourism is when the tourist travels to participate in recreational sporting, or signing up for leisure interests. Hiking, skiing, running and canoeing can be described as soft sports tourism. Perhaps the most common form of soft sports tourism involves golf in regards to destinations in Europe and the United States. A large number of people are interested in playing some of the world's greatest and highest ranked courses, and take great pride in checking those destinations off of their list of places to visit. =Sporting event tourism= Sports event tourism refers to the visitors who visit a city to watch events. The two events that attract the most tourists worldwide are the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. These events held once every four years, in a different city in the world. Sport tourism in the United States is more focused on events that happen annually. The major event for the National Football League is the Super Bowl, held at the end of the year in different city every year. Even though the National Hockey League started the annual NHL Winter Classic game in 2008, the 2014 New Year's outdoor hockey game rivaled the Stanley Cup Tournament in popularity and \\"revitalized the NHL\\". As of 2015, the newest trend in college basketball was to start the season off with annual tournaments such as the Maui Invitational held in Hawaii, and the Battle for Atlantis which is played in the Bahamas. This idea of pairing quality sports events with the Bahamas attractions raised the island's profile and brought in more visitors and dollars to the country. The Battle for Atlantis brought more than 5,000 fans in during Thanksgiving week for the three-day tournament. The event helped increase hotel capacity from what is typically around 60 percent this time of year to 90 percent. Sport tourism \\"is a growing market and many different cities and countries want to be involved,‚Äù = Sporting event tourism - NFL = Since 2007 the NFL came up with the idea of having games played in different countries. Every year since an NFL game has been played in either London or in Mexico City. =Celebrity and nostalgia sport tourism= Celebrity and nostalgia sport tourism involves visits to the sports halls of fame and venue and meeting sports personalities in a vacation basis. =Active sport tourism= Active sport tourism refers to those who participate in the sports or sport events. Rugby football, football, basketball, etc are considered active sports and many sport events (which we call tournaments or festivals) are organized each year in most of the countries in the world.

The CDS does not, however, have operational command authority over service branches, but rather oversees inter-service co-operation and develops and implements the joint operations doctrine of the Sri Lankan armed forces. Coordination of inter-service joint operations are handled by the Office of the Chief of Defence Staff formally known as the Joint Operations Headquarters. Lieutenant General Shavendra Silva, the Army Commander is serving as the acting Chief of Defence Staff. The CDS is the Chairman of a Committee made up of service commanders and is a member of the National Security Council. History The post could be traced back to post of General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Joint Operations Command when General T. I. Weerathunga was first appointed to it on November 2, 1985. The Joint Operations Command was created in 1985 due to a need to co- ordinate of joint operations among the tri-services and the police with the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War. The post itself was created in 1999 replacing the civilian post of chief of the Joint Operations Bureau which had existed briefly in 1999. Its powers expanded under the Chief of Defence Staff Act No. 35 of 2009. In recent years, the Chief of the Defence Staff was appointed to the highest rank in the branch of the Sri Lankan armed forces to which he belonged (equivalent to a British \\"four-star\\" rank) being a General, an Admiral or an Air Chief Marshal. According to the new Bill, the President of Sri Lanka appoints to the post of Chief of Defence Staff any person presently serving as Commander of the Army, Navy or the Air Force, to function under the direction, supervision and control of the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Defence. Responsibilities  * Assist in providing for the strategic direction of the armed forces * Development of doctrine for the joint employment of the armed forces * Facilitation of preparation of strategic plans for the armed forces * Co-ordination of matters relating to intelligence as between the armed forces; * To undertake assessments to determine the capabilities of the armed forces in comparison with those of their potential * Preparation of operational plans for the armed forces Supporting and associated posts The CDS is assisted by a Chief of Staff (two star rank) and four Director Generals (Operations and systems, Training, Naval and Air Operations, Coordination) making up the Office of the Chief of Defence Staff.

Altogether, 66 Polish women died fighting in Lviv in late 1918. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919‚Äì1921, Ochotnicza Legia Kobiet, which grew to 2,500 members, helped the Polish Army in such places as Warsaw and Vilnius (from May 1919). In Vilnius, in mid-1920, Polish women under Wanda Gertz defended the city, facing the Mounted Corps of Gai Khan. After the war, in 1923, the organization was dissolved. Five years later, members of the OLK created the organization Przysposobienie Wojskowe Kobiet (Women's Military Training\\").

In the 1970s, this class of enzyme was found to repair at apurinic or apyrimidinic DNA sites in E. coli and in mammalian cells. The major active enzymes of this class in bacteria, and specifically, E. coli is endonuclease type III. This enzyme encompasses a family of lyases that cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. Several names for DNA AP lyase include: AP lyase; AP endonuclease class I; endodeoxyribonuclease (apurinic or apyrimidinic); deoxyribonuclease (apurinic or apyrimidinic); E. coli endonuclease III; phage-T4 UV endonuclease; Micrococcus luteus UV endonuclease; AP site-DNA 5'-phosphomonoester-lyase; and X-ray endonuclease III. Structural studies Since DNA AP lyase is a class of structures who have numerous target genes that encode for different variations of the enzyme, there is no one single enzyme structure that can be used as an example that encompasses all versions of the enzyme. As of March 2015, 99 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes. Examples from PDB are the accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Mechanism AP lyase enzymes catalyze reactions analogous to Œ≤-elimination reaction. Initially, AP hydrolyses, such as apurinic or apyrimidinic endonuclease I contain a Mg2+ active site that cleaves the DNA on the 5'-side, yielding a 5'-deoxyribosephosphate and 3'-OH. An AP site in DNA appears when the glycosylic bond that connects the purine or pyrimidine base to the deoxyribose sugar is cleaved. This reaction is referred to as depurination or depyrimidination. The sugar at the AP site is a highly unstable cyclic carboxonium ion that undergoes rapid hydrolysis to yield a diastereomeric mixture of 2-deoxy-Œ±-D-ribose and 2-deoxy-Œ≤-D-ribose. AP lyase enzymes could be trapped on both pre-incised and unincised AP DNA by a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of AP lyases, the Œ≤-elimination reaction, proceeds through an imine enzyme‚ÄìDNA intermediate. AP lyase mechanism. AP lyase, in blue, catalyzes the second reaction. Biological function In E. coli, DNA AP lyase (endonuclease III) helps repair oxidative damage to DNA bases by catalyzing the excision of the damaged pyrimidines and purines from ring saturation or opening from the DNA backbone. This damage can be caused by non-enzymatic hydrolysis, and/or exposure to ionizing radiation. Both UV endonuclease V from bacteriophage T4 (UV endonuclease V) and UV endonuclease III from E. coli catalyze N- glycosylase and the 3‚Äò-abasic endonuclease reactions. Bacteriophage T4 and Micrococcus luteus UV endonucleases were actually shown not to be under the class of \\"endonuclease,\\" but rather were Œ≤-elimination catalysts for reactions at AP sites at the C3'-O-P bond‚Äîthus, classifying them as AP lyases. Phage-T4 UV endonucleases also catalyze the reaction of the Œ¥-reaction, nicking C5'-O-P bond at AP sites, although this reaction is slow and the enzyme should still be classified as AP lyase. This open ring allows the substitution of the correct base by other enzymes. DNA AP lyase activity is documented to have similar function in both E. Coli and in humans. A homolog of endonuclease III, human endonuclease III homolog 1, or hNTH1 functions similarly in humans as its homolog does in E. Coli. Disease relevance DNA damage is ubiquitous amongst all forms of life. There is an estimated 1 x 10‚àí4 to 1 x 10‚àí6 mutations per human gamete, which follows to finding at least one mutation at a specific locus per one million gametes. DNA is the only biologic molecule that relies solely on repair of existing molecules, and is the largest molecule that can continue to function albeit numerous mutations; thus, mutations accumulate over time. However without this repair, conditions such as UV-sensitive syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum, and Cockayne syndrome may arise. =Examples= The least severe of the three, people suffering from UV-sensitive syndrome experience UV-hypersensitivity. The syndrome arises from a mutation in the KIAA1530 protein. Unlike other severe conditions involving skin cancers and significantly reduced lifespan, this condition may result in freckles, and other skin blemishes, but does not increase likelihood of attracting a skin cancer. This condition is so rare that it has been documented to occur in seven individuals worldwide. However, it is speculated that this condition is understudied, and there are, in fact, more individuals living with the syndrome. Xeroderma pigmentosum or XP is a rare genetic disorder that occurs worldwide. On affected people, exposure to UV radiation, especially from the sun is limited and solar pigmentations and xerosis occur. The affected may lose eyebrows, become bloodshot in the eyes, and in extreme, untreated cases, may result in extreme photo-damage resulting in skin cancers and decreased lifespan due to metastatic malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. However, some studies report that experimental treatments with repair enzyme T4 endonuclease V and oral isotretinoin may be useful in preventing skin cancer acquired from the disorder. If transcription- coupled repair is lost, it has little effect on mutagenesis; however, this has severe implications on progeroid syndromes, especially in genes encoding CSA and CSB proteins. Mutations in these genes cause Cockayne Syndrome, which is characterized by early cessation of growth and development, leading to severe and progressive neurodysfunction associated with demyelination, sensorineural hearing loss, cataracts, cachexia, and frailty. The average lifespan of patients with the disease is 12 years. For CS Type II patients who have little neural growth after birth, the lifespan is significantly decreased to 7 years after birth. This condition can occur alongside xeroderma pigmentosum, resulting in xeroderma pigmentosum-cockayne syndrome (XP-CS).

(1921‚Äì2003), was an American educational psychologist and entrepreneur. She is best known for her applying J. P. Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory of human intelligence to the field of education. Meeker was born in Louisiana and grew up there and in Texas. She attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in psychology. Meeker subsequently moved to California and began graduate studies in educational psychology at the University of Southern California, where she studied with J. P. Guilford, whose work would be central to her career. Meeker earned a Master of Science, a Master of Education and, in 1971, a Ph.D. in Education from USC. SI and SOI Meeker's doctoral dissertation focused on applying Guilford's Structure of Intellect theory (\\"SI\\") to creating assessments and curriculum materials for use in teaching children and adults. The premise of SI is that intelligence comprises many underlying mental abilities or factors, organized along three dimensions‚ÄîOperations (e.g., comprehension), Content (e.g., semantic), and Products (e.g., relations). Explanation of Guilford‚Äôs Structure of Intellect theory In this three-dimensional model, each intersection of the three dimensions represents as a unique intellectual ability, such as comprehension of semantic relations; that is, understanding analogies. During Meeker's studies, she saw the potential of applying SI in the field of education, based on a twofold premise: 1) intelligence can be precisely measured using a test that identifies an individual's aptitude on the multiple intellectual abilities identified in the Structure of Intellect model; and 2) the individual's intellectual abilities can be remediated or improved using learning materials that target each particular ability. Meeker called her application of Guilford's theory \\"SOI.\\" =SOI testing= SOI assessment materials, including the SOI Learning Abilities (or \\"SOI-LA\\") test instrument, Western Psychological Services (which publishes the SOILA test) measure intelligence corresponding to those intellectual abilities from Guilford's SI model that Meeker determined to be most closely correlated to educational and professional success. (She excluded other SI abilities from SOI due to their perceived difficulty of assessment or their lack of correlation to educational requirements.) After she normed and validated the SOI-LA instrument in the late 1970s and early 1980s, she began producing tests and corresponding remedial materials for school districts and private clinics. In many states, the SOI-LA is accepted for screening students for admission into gifted and special education school programs, and worldwide, SOI-LA is used in private clinics. =SOI training= SOI learning materials are useful in addressing learning disabilities in early childhood education. Basic school tasks such as reading or arithmetic are actually complex tasks that require application of multiple underlying abilities. Because children who fail at these classroom tasks often lack the underlying abilities to succeed at them, attempts to teach those children to perform such tasks are not successful. Some children who cannot read may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a word (i.e., a series of graphical figures) with its meaning (i.e., a semantic unit); and some children who cannot perform arithmetic may lack the underlying intellectual ability to associate a digit (a numeric unit) with its meaning (a symbolic unit). SOI training can remediate these underlying intellectual abilities to enable mastery of reading and arithmetic. The SOI model is designed to address learning disabilities in stages. An SOI test assesses the individual's underlying intellectual abilities, including the constituent abilities enabling performance of the targeted task. Then, after the individual's SOI profile is compared against the intellectual abilities that enable the targeted task (such as reading or arithmetic), specific intellectual abilities are identified for remediation. Finally, SOI curriculum materials train the identified abilities so that, after the abilities are remediated, the individual may learn to perform the more complex task.New Horizons for Learning, discussing learning styles and their relation to Meeker‚Äôs workDescription of relationship of Guilford‚Äôs work to Meeker‚ÄôsDescription of Guilford and Meeker's work The SOI model can be useful in assessing learning styles, because the SOI-LA test includes separate measures of visual and auditory learning abilities. SOI has been related to the multiple intelligences theory promulgated by Howard Gardner. Later work In 1975, Meeker and her husband, Robert Meeker, opened the SOI Institute, a business producing SOI tests and educational materials and conducting training for educators and related research. During the 1980s and 1990s, Meeker developed a wide reputation in the field of educational psychology, and continued to run the SOI Institute.Official web site of the Structure of Intellect Institute During this time, Meeker was engaged as a consultant for the state departments of education in California, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In the 1990s, Meeker worked extensively with Bridges Learning Systems, Bridges Learning Systems, an educational company using SOI materials and model a commercial enterprise founded by former U.S. Senator William E. Brock to implement school programs based on Meeker's SOI work and on the Integrated Practice Protocol (IPP) she developed with her husband, Robert Meeker. IPP comprises SOI-related assessments and learning and teaching materials that incorporate intelligence assessment (such as with the SOI-LA test), vision assessment, and sensory integration assessment. For example, some children who cannot read may lack the underlying ability to visually distinguish one alphabetical character from another. This perceptual (visual) aspect of SOI illustrates the extensions of SOI application made in IPP by Meeker and Meeker. In later life, Mary Meeker devoted herself semi-professionally to watercolor painting, winning a variety of local prizes.Interview describing Meeker's work, including her watercolors Her subjects of choice were florals and landscapes. Mary Meeker died in 2003, survived by her husband, her three daughters, and two grandchildren. Her husband, Robert Meeker, continues her work via the operation of SOI Systems in Springfield, Oregon.

Twenty-one other Asian Americans also received the nation's highest military honor during the ceremony, although, and unfortunately, only seven of them by then remained living to receive it. \\"21 Asian American World War II Vets to Get Medal of Honor\\" at University of Hawaii Digital History ; retrieved 2012-12-27.

History  The diocese was created as the first one on the territory of present-day Slovakia around 880 (from the Diocese of Regensburg), during the time of Great Moravia. Its first bishop was the Saint Methodius. Its destiny after the fall of Great Moravia isn't known. It was re-established in 1105 as part of the ecclesiastical province of Esztergom in the Kingdom of Hungary. In 1977, it was taken from the Archdiocese of Esztergom and attached into the newly established Diocese of Trnava. Before the reorganization in 2008, it was situated in the western parts of the Trenƒç√≠n and ≈Ωilina regions (basically the former Trencs√©n County) with a strip connecting it to the city of Nitra. It had an area of 5,321 km¬≤ and a population of that area was 838,861 of which around 84% were of Catholic faith (2004). On 14 February 2008, the territory of the diocese was reorganized. The diocese lost northern parts to the newly created Diocese of ≈Ωilina, but gained territory around the \\"strip\\" and southern parts from the Archdiocese of Bratislava-Trnava.

The highway connected Highway 69 at Foot's Bay with Highway 12 at Brechin southeast of Orillia, a distance of , including an concurrency with Highway 11 between Gravenhurst and Washago. Highway 169, originally the southern leg of Highway 69, was formed on May 15, 1976 when the latter was rerouted along Highway 103 south of Foot's Bay to Waubaushene. The highway was downgraded from provincial highway to district road status during the highway transfers of 1998. On January 1 of that year, the route was designated as Muskoka District Road 169 from Foot's Bay to Gravenhurst, and Simcoe County Road 169 from Washago to Brechin. Through Muskoka District, the road is also known as the Frank Miller Memorial Route. Highway 169 entering Gravenhurst  Route description  The former route of Highway 169 has remained relatively unaltered since it was downloaded in 1998. It begins at an intersection with Highway 12 approximately north of the Trent Severn Waterway and east of the Atherley Narrows. It proceeds north at a point where Highway 12 begins to curve west towards Orillia, passing through meadows and forests and the occasional ranch. It passes through the community of Udney, curves northeast and intersects the Monck Road while curving back northwards. The highway continues in a straight line through the communities of O'Connell and Fawkham, crossing the Black River immediately south of the latter. Gently curving to the northeast, the route enters the village of Washago, after which it interchanges with Highway 11 south of the Severn River. The two highways travelled concurrently north from this point as a divided four lane expressway, where they entered the Canadian Shield, where the terrain is rougher, rockier, and dotted with lakes, to the southern entrance of Gravenhurst. However, the modern district road does not travel concurrently along Highway 11. At Exit 169, the southern entrance to Gravenhurst, the route resumes, exiting the freeway and entering the town through a rock cut. Exiting Gravenhurst, the highway stays close to the western shore of Lake Muskoka, serving recreational cottages. The route passes north of the Devils Gap Trail, which follows the old Bala-Gravenhurst Colonization Road, then passes through the community of Torrance where it encounters a junction with Muskoka District Road 13. Approximately northwest of this point, the highway passes through Bala shortly after curving north at an intersection with Muskoka District Road 38. The highway presses north, crossing both a Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railway in two separate locations. After intersecting Muskoka District Roads 29 and 26, it enters the community of Glen Orchard. Within that community, the route intersects the former western terminus of Highway 118 (which now ends at Highway 11), then gradually curves west to hug the southern shore of Lake Joseph. After a winding drive west, the highway enters Foot's Bay and ends at the former route of Highway 69.  History  Highway 169 east of Orillia The entire route of highway 169 was originally part of the routing of Highway 69, which was itself first designated in 1936. At that time, the route connected Atherley and Washago along the Rama Road, now Simcoe County Road 44. On April 1, 1937, the Department of Northern Development merged into the Department of Highways, opening roads north of the Severn River for assumption by the department. The road between Gravenhurst and Parry Sound and on to Pointe au Baril subsequently became an extension of Highway 69, while the road between Washago and Gravenhurst became a concurrency between it and Highway 11\\\\. During the early-1950s, the southern of the route was transferred to local municipalities and a new, longer route was designated to the east, merging with Highway 12 north of Brechin. This routing remained in place until May 15 1976, when the province rerouted Highway 69 along Highway 103 between Waubaushene and Foot's Bay in order to create a more direct route between Toronto and Sudbury. The route of Highway 69 between Foot's Bay and Brechin became Highway 169 at this point. The highway remained unmodified throughout its two decades of existence. On January 1, 1998, both sections of Highway 169 were transferred to the municipalities in which they were located; the southern section was transferred to Simcoe County and the northern section to the District Municipality of Muskoka. Both sections are still numbered 169, though they are now county roads.

Every function in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is a primitive recursive function, and every primitive recursive function appears in the hierarchy at some level. The hierarchy deals with the rate at which the values of the functions grow; intuitively, functions in lower level of the hierarchy grow slower than functions in the higher levels.  Definition  First we introduce an infinite set of functions, denoted Ei for some natural number i. We define E_0(x,y)=x+y and E_1(x)=x^2+2. I.e., E0 is the addition function, and E1 is a unary function which squares its argument and adds two. Then, for each n greater than 1, we define E_n(x)=E^{x}_{n-1}(2), i.e. the x-th iterate of E_{n-1} evaluated at 2. From these functions we define the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. \\\\mathcal{E}^n, the n-th set in the hierarchy, contains the following functions: # Ek for k < n # the zero function (Z(x) = 0); # the successor function (S(x) = x + 1); # the projection functions ( p_i^m(t_1, t_2, \\\\dots, t_m) = t_i ); # the (generalized) compositions of functions in the set (if h, g1, g2, ... and gm are in \\\\mathcal{E}^n, then f(\\\\bar{u}) = h(g_1(\\\\bar{u}), g_2(\\\\bar{u}), \\\\dots, g_m(\\\\bar{u})) is as well); and # the results of limited (primitive) recursion applied to functions in the set, (if g, h and j are in \\\\mathcal{E}^n and f(t, \\\\bar{u}) \\\\leq j(t, \\\\bar{u}) for all t and \\\\bar{u}, and further f(0, \\\\bar{u}) = g(\\\\bar{u}) and f(t+1, \\\\bar{u}) = h(t,\\\\bar{u},f(t,\\\\bar{u})), then f is in \\\\mathcal{E}^n as well) In other words, \\\\mathcal{E}^n is the closure of set B_n = \\\\\\\\{Z, S, (p_i^m)_{i \\\\le m}, E_k : k < n\\\\\\\\} with respect to function composition and limited recursion (as defined above).  Properties  These sets clearly form the hierarchy : \\\\mathcal{E}^0 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{E}^1 \\\\subseteq \\\\mathcal{E}^2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots because they are closures over the B_n's and B_0 \\\\subseteq B_1 \\\\subseteq B_2 \\\\subseteq \\\\cdots. They are strict subsets (Rose 1984; Gakwaya 1997). In other words : \\\\mathcal{E}^0 \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathcal{E}^1 \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathcal{E}^2 \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots because the hyper operation H_n is in \\\\mathcal{E}^n but not in \\\\mathcal{E}^{n-1}. *\\\\mathcal{E}^0 includes functions such as x+1, x+2, ... *\\\\mathcal{E}^1 provides all addition functions, such as x+y, 4x, ... *\\\\mathcal{E}^2 provides all multiplication functions, such as xy, x4 *\\\\mathcal{E}^3 provides all exponentiation functions, such as xy, 222x, and is exactly the elementary recursive functions. *\\\\mathcal{E}^4 provides all tetration functions, and so on. Notably, both the function U and the characteristic function of the predicate T from the Kleene normal form theorem are definable in a way such that they lie at level \\\\mathcal{E}^0 of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy. This implies in particular that every recursively enumerable set is enumerable by some \\\\mathcal{E}^0-function.  Relation to primitive recursive functions  The definition of \\\\mathcal{E}^n is the same as that of the primitive recursive functions, , except that recursion is limited (f(t, \\\\bar{u}) \\\\leq j(t, \\\\bar{u}) for some j in \\\\mathcal{E}^n) and the functions (E_k)_{k are explicitly included in \\\\mathcal{E}^n. Thus the Grzegorczyk hierarchy can be seen as a way to limit the power of primitive recursion to different levels. It is clear from this fact that all functions in any level of the Grzegorczyk hierarchy are primitive recursive functions (i.e. \\\\mathcal{E}^n \\\\subseteq \\\\mathsf{PR} ) and thus: : \\\\bigcup_n{\\\\mathcal{E}^n} \\\\subseteq \\\\mathsf{PR} It can also be shown that all primitive recursive functions are in some level of the hierarchy (Rose 1984; Gakwaya 1997), thus : \\\\bigcup_n{\\\\mathcal{E}^n} = \\\\mathsf{PR} and the sets \\\\mathcal{E}^0, \\\\mathcal{E}^1 - \\\\mathcal{E}^0, \\\\mathcal{E}^2 - \\\\mathcal{E}^1, \\\\dots, \\\\mathcal{E}^n - \\\\mathcal{E}^{n-1}, \\\\dots partition the set of primitive recursive functions, .  Extensions  The Grzegorczyk hierarchy can be extended to transfinite ordinals. Such extensions define a fast-growing hierarchy. To do this, the generating functions E_\\\\alpha must be recursively defined for limit ordinals (note they have already been recursively defined for successor ordinals by the relation E_{\\\\alpha+1}(n) = E_\\\\alpha^n(2) ). If there is a standard way of defining a fundamental sequence \\\\lambda_m, whose limit ordinal is \\\\lambda, then the generating functions can be defined E_\\\\lambda(n) = E_{\\\\lambda_n}(n) . However, this definition depends upon a standard way of defining the fundamental sequence. Rose (1984) suggests a standard way for all ordinals Œ± < Œµ0.

Jenkins was one of the greatest backs to have played for Llanelli and is compared to later Scarlet heroes Lewis Jones and Phil Bennett.Thomas (1979), p. 60. Jenkins was a strong tackler and was an extremely fast runner from a standing start. He was also an excellent kicker with either foot and could punt the ball half the length of the pitch. He was sometimes criticised for his decision making on the field, and wasn't at his best away from Stradey Park. In the book Stradey Stories, author comments, \\"such was his drawing power that if by some quirk of fate, Albert could not take to the field because of injury or work commitment (he was a steelworker), the fans would leave the stadium in droves and not bother to watch the ensuing match.\\" Jenkins is seen as one of Llanelli's greatest players but he was at his peak when Welsh rugby was at one of its worst points in its history. Club career Jenkins played for Llanelli juniors but on the outbreak of the First World War Jenkins joined the British Army and served in France in the 38th Welsh Regiment. The 38th Welsh Regiment fought at the Somme, Ypres and Epehy, three most gruelling, gruesome and vicious battles. He served his country with distinction in one of the most horrific and bloody conflicts in history. On his return in 1919, Jenkins rejoined Llanelli and gained a position in the senior team. He would later play for Llanelli against the New Zealand All Blacks, losing in 1924, but beating them 3‚Äì0 in 1926. International career Jenkins played fourteen matches for Wales, his first cap was against England on 14 January 1920 just four months after his Llanelli debut. His greatest international was the game against Ireland in 1920 when Jenkins set up three tries for club mate Bryn Williams, scored a try himself, kicked two of the resulting conversions and was successful with a drop goal attempt. In the 1921 game against Scotland, Jenkins played with incredible commitment, but on occasions it appeared he was playing the Scots on his own due to the poor performance of the rest of the Welsh team. Jenkins would go on to captain Wales twice, his first against Ireland in 1923, losing both games. In 1950 a tribute match was held in his honour at Stradey Park. Jenkins passed away on 7 October 1953 and was buried at Box cemetery, Llanelli.

The son of a senior Royal Navy officer and from a family with a long military tradition, Harvey distinguished himself under his father at the Glorious First of June and as a post-captain in his own right at Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's attempt to force the Dardanelles in 1807 and commanded numerous ships and stations in the post-war period. Early career Thomas Harvey was born in 1775, the fourth son of Admiral Sir Henry Harvey and Elizabeth (n√©e Boys). Shortly after his birth, his father, then a Captain, left for service on the North America and West Indian stations during the American Revolutionary War. Raised in Kent with his mother and elder brothers, Harvey was sent to join the Navy aged only 12, serving for the next seven years aboard HMS Ramillies. In 1793 Ramillies became his father's ship and under Captain Harvey, young Thomas participated in the battle of the Glorious First of June when his ship rescued the embattled HMS Brunswick commanded by his uncle John Harvey. John Harvey died later of his wounds, but Thomas benefited from the general promotion which followed the action and became a lieutenant.Harvey, Sir Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, J. K. Laughton, Retrieved 21 November 2007 Harvey moved from Ramillies to HMS Prince of Wales when his father raised his flag in her and both were aboard during the Battle of Groix where Prince of Wales was extensively engaged and three French ships of the line were taken. Remaining with his father during 1795 and the first half of 1796, Harvey benefited from family contacts to receive promotion to commander in July 1796 and take command of the brig and then HMS Pelican, his first independent commands aged just 21. In Pelican Harvey was present when his father captured Trinidad in 1797 and as a result was awarded with promotion to post-captain at the extremely young age of 22. Napoleonic Wars Following promotion, Harvey was given command of the frigates HMS Lapwing and HMS Unit√© for brief spells and in 1800 was recalled to England to serve with the force being prepared in the Thames under Horatio Nelson, who had been a shipmate of his father in the 1780s. Following the dispersal and then regrowth of the Navy surrounding the Peace of Amiens in 1801, Harvey was favoured with command of ship of the line HMS Standard, which was attached to Cuthbert Collingwood's Mediterranean fleet. It was whilst serving with this force in 1807 that Harvey was present at the attempt by Admiral John Thomas Duckworth to force the Dardanelles and drive the Turkish Empire out of the war. The operation was a failure, after Turkish shore batteries opened a murderous fire on the British squadron attempting to force passage on the 19 February 1807. Harvey had been instrumental in burning a Turkish squadron moored at the entrance to the Dardanelles, but during the return from Constantinople a round shot more than two feet in diameter crashed through Standard's lower deck, detonating a ready magazine of gun charges and killing several men before the resulting fire could be brought under control. Across the squadron as a whole, over a hundred men were killed and the operation made no effect on the diplomatic situation. In 1808 Harvey returned to England and commanded the ships of the line HMS Majestic in the Baltic Sea and HMS Sceptre in the North Sea. He did not participate in any significant actions during the remainder of the war and at the reformation of the Order of the Bath in 1815, Harvey was made a Companion. Senior command Post-war, Harvey spent long periods on half-pay ashore with his wife Sarah (daughter of his uncle John Harvey) and eight children. Two of his three sons, Thomas Harvey and Henry Harvey later became admirals themselves and led distinguished careers, whilst his third son William Harvey joined the church. From 1819 to 1821 Harvey was given the plum role of commander of the Sheerness guardship HMS Northumberland until in 1821 he was promoted to rear-admiral, necessitating a temporary retirement from service until a suitable position opened up. It was not until 17 years later, in 1839, that Harvey's seniority (now a Vice-Admiral and Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath), allowed him to become Commander-in-Chief of the North America and West Indies Station, a position which both his father and his cousin John Harvey had previously held. The command was exercised from Bermuda, and it was there, at Admiralty House that he died, still serving, in May 1841. He was buried on the island.

She is believed to be a daughter of the Welsh King Brychan, and a native of South Wales who travelled to North Cornwall to join her siblings in converting the locals to Christianity. Legend says that she was a goddaughter of King Arthur, and that she lived as a hermit at Trentinney where she subsisted on the milk of a cow. The saint is commemorated in the church and village of St Endellion which bear her name; Endellion being an Anglicised version of her name. Her feast day is 29 April. Life Tradition makes her a daughter of King Brychan, of Brycheiniog in South Wales. The village of Saint Endellion in Cornwall, named after her, is from where she is said to have evangelized the local population. Two former wells near the village were named after her. She is called \\"Cenheidlon\\" in Welsh records, with Endelienta being a Latinised form of the name. Her feast day is 29 April. The saint is believed to have been a native of South Wales who crossed the Bristol Channel to join her siblings in converting the people of North Cornwall to Christianity. During her journey, she initially landed on the island of Lundy, where she is believed to have founded a small chapel, which would later be wrongly rededicated to Saint Helen. She subsequently moved on to the mainland where she stayed with her brother, Saint Nectan, at Hartland, before eventually choosing to settle at Trentinney, south-west of the present day village of St Endellion, although she would return to Lundy from time to time on retreat for meditation.\\"Who was Endelienta?\\", Endelienta She lived at Trentinney as a hermit, where legend says that she subsisted solely on the milk of a cow, and the water from two nearby wells. Her sister, St Dilic (whose church is at Landulph), settled nearby and the two would often meet along a certain path whose grass would ever afterwards grow greener than elsewhere. The cow was killed by the Lord of Trentinney after straying onto his land. He in turn is said to have been killed by Endelienta's Godfather, reputed to be King Arthur, after Arthur was angered by the deed and sent his men to exact revenge. However, Endelienta was said to be unhappy that Trentinney had been killed in her name, and restored the nobleman back to life. Following a vision of her death, the saint is said to have asked that upon her death, her body should be placed on a sledge or cart drawn by bullocks, and that she should be buried at the place where they stopped. She is thought to have died on 29 April some time in the 6th century, and possibly at the hands of Saxon pirates. She was buried at the top of a hill, and a church built over her grave. The present church at St Endellion stands on that site. Legacy A chapel dedicated to Saint Endelienta survived on the site of her hermitage at Trenteney until the 16th century, while her shrine at the Church of St Endellion was a site of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages. It was virtually destroyed during the Reformation, but the base survives to the present day and can still be viewed. The St Endellion Music Festivals take place at Easter and in the Summer every year in the St Endellion church.Saint Endellion Festivals In 2005 a local iconographer was commissioned to produce an icon of Saint Endelienta, even though there were no known images of her on which to base the work. On 25 August 2010 it was announced that British Prime Minister, David Cameron, and his wife Samantha had named their newborn daughter Florence Rose EndellionFlorence Rose Endellion Cameron, born at Truro after the village of St Endellion, reflecting the fact she was born while the Cameron family were holidaying in Cornwall.

Located in the Muskoka District, the highway extended from Highway 12 at Waubaushene to Highway 69 at Foot's Bay. Opened in 1944, the highway existed until 1976, when a series of renumberings eliminated the designation, replacing it with Highway 69; Highway 400 has since been built over the majority of this former route.  Route description  Highway 103 followed much of the route that Highway 400 now takes between Highway 12 at Coldwater and the former Highway 69 junction (Exit 189) south of Mactier. From there it followed what is now Lake Joseph Road to Foot's Bay, where it met what became Highway 169, now known as Muskoka District Road 169. Between Coldwater and Waubaushene, the route was concurrent with Highway 12 for a brief period in the mid-1960s. From there, it crossed over Matchedash Bay and circled around the south and eastern shoreline of Sturgeon Bay to Port Severn. From there, the route travelled through was then a barren wilderness for within the District of Muskoka. At Foot's Bay, the route encountered Highway 69, which continued east to Highway 11 in Gravenhurst and north to Sudbury.  History  Highway 103 was first designated during the Second World War, providing access from Highway 12 at Waubaushene to Port Severn. The highway was in length for its first decade of existence. During the mid-1950s, the highway was extended north to Foot's Bay to connect with Highway 69\\\\. This extension was open by May 1958, and the entirety of the route was designated as Highway 69 on May 15, 1976, concurrently with Highway 69's earlier routing from Foot's Bay to Brechin being redesignated as Highway 169. The entirety of the former route has now been superseded by the northward extension of Highway 400.

In the 1960s, she organized and participated in civil rights and anti-war movements.La Manana, Izando. Hauling Up the Morning. Red Sea Press, Trenton, New Jersey. 1990. p.404. Early days Born in Brooklyn, New York, Whitehorn holds a master's degree from Brandeis University.Day, Susan. Cruel but Not Unusual: The Punishment of Women in U.S. Prisons. An Interview with Marilyn Buck and Laura Whitehorn by Susan Day. NeoSlave Narratives: Prison Writing and Abolitionism. SUNY Press, 2004. After working as an organizer for Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Whitehorn became a member of the Weathermen/The Weather Underground organization in 1969. She traveled with them to Havana, Cuba as part of the organization's instruction in the ideology of Marxism and urban warfare, visiting one of the camps established by Soviet KGB Colonel Vadim Kotchergine.Whitehorn, Laura. (2007) \\"The Days of Rage\\" On October 6, of that same year, the Weathermen blew up an 1889 commemorative nine-foot bronze statue of a Chicago policeman located in Haymarket Square in Chicago, Illinois, preceding several days of street fighting between protesters and police. According to FBI records, the \\"Days of Rage\\" or the \\"National Action\\" rapidly degenerated into destructive riots and open confrontations with Chicago Police, leaving a vast amount of public property destroyed, including 100 shattered windows in the vicinity. The Weather Underground Organization (WUO) made a number of demands, primarily related to the Vietnam War. Whitehorn, along with approximately 55 other people, was arrested for her participation in the violence. A Federal Grand Jury in Chicago later returned a number of indictments charging WUO members with violation of Federal Antiriot Laws. The Antiriot Law charges were dropped in January 1974. Townhouse explosion The March 6, 1970 Greenwich Village townhouse explosion was a culmination of the political direction in which Weatherman had been headed, according to Whitehorn. \\"We were out of touch with what was going on, and we lost sight of the fact that if you're a revolutionary, the first thing you have to try to do is preserve human life.\\" Three Weathermen died in the explosion, Terry Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold. Whitehorn said great care was taken during the numerous bombings to ensure that no one would be hurt, including the janitorial staff. Feminist education In 1971, Laura Whitehorn helped organize and lead a takeover and occupation of a Harvard University building by nearly 400 women to protest the war in Vietnam and demand a women's center. One of the founders of the Boston/Cambridge Women's School, Whitehorn helped establish the school as an alternative source of feminist education. Operated and taught by a collective of female volunteers until it closed in 1992, Boston/Cambridge Women's School had gained the reputation as the longest running women's school in the United States at the time.Women's School Records. Archives. Climate of militancy The dead end of militancy and violence for their own sake was obvious after the townhouse explosion, says Whitehorn.Berger, Dan. Outlaws of America. AK Press, Oakland, CA. 2006 Events at the 1972 Republican National Convention protest led Whitehorn to question once more the need for militancy, confirming her belief that they should allow for militancy when guided by a political framework, but not militancy for militancy's sake. Battle of Boston During the Boston busing crisis, which the WUO referred to as \\"the Battle of Boston,\\" Whitehorn was among a small group of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee (PFOC) activists in the Boston area who sat with baseball bats in people's homes, protecting families from local white supremacists who tried to attack with bats, Molotov cocktails and spray-paint. While Whitehorn and other members of the aboveground cadre carried out their vigilance for two years, the WUO engaged in only minor confrontational tactics in response to the Boston crisis. Prairie Fire Organizing Committee The Prairie Fire Organizing Committee, of which Whitehorn was a member, planned the Hard Times Conference (with WUO support and leadership) as a way to build a national multiracial coalition. The goal was to bring together a multiracial crowd of more than 2,000 people at the University of Illinois Circle Campus in Chicago, from January 30 to February 1, 1976. The slogan for the conference was \\"Hard Times are Fighting Times.\\" Even though attendance far surpassed what the WUO and PFOC had anticipated, the conference became a political disaster. Whitehorn was so nauseated by the politics of the conference that she became physically ill in the middle of it. \\"I hated it more than anything else I've ever done, she told Nicole Kief in an interview on October 20, 2002. She began to pull away from the WUO. By the early 1980s, Whitehorn was active in a variety of radical organizations, in addition to the May 19 Communist Organization, including the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee and the Madame Binh Graphics Collective, a radical art group named for Nguyen Thi Binh, the Viet Cong's lead negotiator at the Paris Peace Talks. During this time, Whitehorn worked with subversive movements in Rhodesia, South Africa and Palestine. Bombings: the May 19 Communist Organization The May 19 Communist Organization, also known as the May 19th Coalition and the May 19 Communist Movement, was a self-described revolutionary organization formed by splintered-off members of the Weather Underground. Originally known as the New York Chapter of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee (PFOC), the group was active from 1978 to 1985. Between 1983 and 1985, the group bombed the United States Senate as well as three military installations in the Washington D.C. area and four sites in New York City. =Arrests= On May 11, 1985 group members Marilyn Buck, wanted for her role in the 1981 Brinks armored car robbery, and Linda Sue Evans were arrested in Dobbs Ferry, New York by FBI agents who had trailed them in the hope the pair would lead them to other fugitives. Whitehorn was arrested the same day in a Baltimore apartment rented by Buck and Evans. At the time of the arrests, group members Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk were already under arrest, Rosenberg for explosives and weapons charges connected with the Brinks robbery, Blunk for similar charges. Fugitive group members Alan Berkman and Elizabeth Ann Duke were captured by the FBI 12 days later near Philadelphia; however, Duke jumped bail and disappeared before trial. The case became known as the Resistance Conspiracy Case. =Indictment, plea and sentencing= On May 12, 1988, the seven members of the group under arrest were indicted. The indictment described the goal of the conspiracy as being \\"to influence, change and protest policies and practices of the United States Government concerning various international and domestic matters through the use of violent and illegal means\\" and charged the seven with bombing the United States Capitol Building, three military installations in the Washington D.C. area, and four sites in New York City. The military sites bombed were the National War College at Fort McNair, the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center, and the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club. In New York City, the sites bombed were the Staten Island Federal Building, the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building, the South African consulate, and the offices of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. On September 6, 1990 The New York Times reported that Whitehorn, Evans and Buck had agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and destruction of Government property. Prosecutors agreed to drop bombing charges against Rosenberg, Blunk and Berkman, who were already serving long prison terms (Rosenberg and Blunk 58 years, Berkman 10) for possession of explosives and weapons. Whitehorn also agreed to plead guilty to fraud in the possession of false identification documents found by the FBI in the Baltimore apartment. At the December 6, 1990 sentencing of Whitehorn and Evans by Federal District Judge Harold H. Greene, in a courtroom packed with supporters, Whitehorn was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Evans to an additional five years after completing a 35-year sentence being served for illegally buying guns. Buck was already serving 17 years on other convictions, and was later sentenced to a 50-year term for the Brinks holdup and other armed robberies. On August 6, 1999 Whitehorn was released on parole after serving just over 14 years. Years in prison During the 14 years Whitehorn served in prison, she directed AIDS education and wrote numerous publications. When asked if her political work ended once she was in prison, she replied that it had consisted basically of three areas: being a political prisoner, organizing and being part of the struggles for justice inside the prisons, and being part of the fight against HIV and AIDS. Whitehorn lost many friends while she was in prison during some of the worst years of the AIDS epidemic. While Whitehorn served time in a Federal women's prison at Lexington, Kentucky, her father, Nathaniel, \\"Tanny\\" Whitehorn died on January 3, 1992. Whitehorn identifies many consequences of being behind bars for fourteen years, including losing someone you love. She notes that not being with them while they are dying, or being able to go to the memorial service afterwards, is just one way families are destroyed by prison. Life after prison Since her release from prison in August 1999, Laura Whitehorn has been involved in a wide range of causes, including the release of political prisoners. She has contributed writings and art work to numerous books and articles, and has been a guest speaker at several universities, including an official guest of the African American Studies Department at Duke University in 2003, where she was presented as a human rights activist by Duke faculty. A past Senior Editor with POZ Magazine in New York City, much of her writing has to do with supporting AIDS healthcare providers and empowering patients through publications. Whitehorn is a member of the NY State taskforce on political prisoners, a group dedicated to supporting New York State \\"political prisoners\\" from the black liberation movement and anti-imperialist solidarity movement. Laura Whitehorn appears in the documentary films, OUT: The Making of a Revolutionary, directed by Sonja DeVries, and The Weather Underground, (2002), directed by Sam Green and Bill Siegel, which includes a cast of former Weather Underground Organization members; Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, Brian Flanagan, David Gilbert, Naomi Jaffe, and Mark Rudd.

This museum is one of the cultural museums under the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, Ministry of Religious Affairs and Culture, the Republic of the Union of Myanmar. It was established in 1974. It displays divans, swords, fans, chairs used by Sawbwa (Shan Chief of former times), old paintings, coins and traditional costumes of the Shan races.Ministry of Culture History At first, the institution was organized as the Shan state Cultural Department at the Shan state office and exhibited some cultural objects on 27 June 1956. According to the new administration system of 1974, it was transferred to the Cultural Institute Department and it was inaugurated as the Cultural Museum at the present building on May 11, 1974. So the 60 years old objects are displayed in the over forty years old museum. Displays In the Cultural Museum (Taunggyi), 808 display objects are exhibited in the four exhibition rooms and a total of 5998 display objects are in the museum's collection. It is two storied brick building and the display area is about 11200 square feet. There are four exhibition rooms; exhibition room (1), exhibition room (2), exhibition room (3) and exhibition room (4). Altogether 880 artifacts are being showcased in the exhibition rooms. =Ground floor= In the reception hall, the map of Shan State (10‚Äôx10‚Äô) is displayed. The Shan State is the largest state existed in the east of Myanmar and it is divided into three parts: east, south and north. Exhibition room (1) and exhibition room (2) are in the ground floor. In the exhibition room (1), the traditional costumes and the traditional instruments of Shan nationalities are displayed. In Shan State, over 30 Shan nationalities are still living and they have their own different cultures. The Shan nationalities have their intangible cultural heritage such as the traditional arts and crafts. Those arts and crafts such as weaving, lacquer wares, glazed wares and traditional Shan paper are displayed in association with explanatory texts in the exhibition room (2). =First floor= Exhibition room (3) and exhibition room (4) are on the first floor. In the exhibition room (3), it is shown about the Pinlon Agreement, the most important event not only in Shan State but also in the whole Myanmar country. On 12 February 1947, the Pinlon agreement leading by General Aung San had been signed by the leaders of the Nationalities of Myanmar in Pinlon, Shan State due to reveal the desire of all Myanmar nationalities to get the Independence altogether from British. The huge oil painting (5‚Äôx8‚Äô) illustrated the signing of Pinlon agreement, the copy of Agreement and the photos of the leaders of Nationalities who signed in the agreement, attached with their biography are displayed. Moreover, the colorful paintings illustrated the traditional cultures of nationalities are also displayed. Exhibition room (4) showcased about the literature of Shan nationality such as palm leaves manuscripts and paper parchments. The photos of the Shan poets are also displayed together with their biography. Besides, it is also displayed to show that the Shan nationalities believe in Buddhism by showcasing the Buddha images made of bronze, wooden, lacquer and clay. And the traditional utensils used in the monasteries for offering the alms food are exhibited. It can reflect that the Shan nationalities deeply believe in the Buddhism. Moreover, the ancient artifacts that can identify the successive periods flourished in the Shan state are exhibited.

The enzyme is a part of the GDP-Fucose de novo synthesis pathway and catalyzes the first step in the process that gives us GDP-Fucose which is essential for the transfer of Fucose sugars. Its primary structure contains 372 amino acids. This is an essential enzyme in that fucose plays a major role in cell immunity and signaling. Currently GDP-Mannose 4, 6-Dehydratase is not the target of any available drugs, however it is being experimentally targeted with the drug Guanosine-5'-Diphosphate. The chemical reaction of GDP-Mannose 4, 6-Dehydratase is as shown: GDP-mannose ‚Üî GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose + H2O  Factors In The Reaction  The enzymes substrate, what the enzyme is acting on, is the GDP-Mannose substance. No other substrates are use this enzyme for reactions. When the enzyme undergoes its catalyzing process the main product is gets is when it converts GDP-mannose to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy- D-mannose which is then subsequently converted to GDP-Fucose which is crucial for the body to process correctly. It acts as an intermediate step between GDP-Mannose and GDP-Fucose. In the reaction that the enzyme uses it requires only one cofactor, a compound required for activation, which is NADP(+) however it is uncertain if this compound truly activates the enzyme. GDP- Fucose is an allosteric inhibitor of the enzyme. Here is a pymol view of the entire structure of the GDP-Mannose 4, 6-Dehydratase enzyme.  GDP-Fucose Biosynthesis Pathway  The enzyme GDP-Mannose 4, 6-Dehydratase is only present in one pathway that we know of. This pathway is the GDP-mannose- dependent de novo pathway which provides most of the bodies GDP-Fucose whereas minor amounts come from fucose salvaging in the body. Here we can see the full crystal structure of the GDP enzyme. Use this link to find the subunits of the enzyme http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/jmol.do?structureId=1RPN&opt;=3 PDB 1rpn In the pathway the enzyme is in an intermediate step that converts GDP- Mannose to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose which is then converted into GDP- Fucose which is absolutely crucial to the body. The product of this pathway is fucosyltransferases which is then used in a different pathway that creates fucosylated glycans which is used for cell signaling and immunity in the body. Fucose is a deoxyhexose that is present in a wide variety of organisms. In most mammals, fucose-containing glycans have important roles in blood transfusion reactions, selectin-mediated leukocyte-endothelial adhesion, host- microbe interactions, and numerous ontogenic events. Along with those the body uses fucose as signaling branches of a cell and also as identification systems in immunity. However the enzyme only works at its top levels under normal body conditions. Increased pH or heat could severely denature the protein causing the enzyme to malfunction. = GDP-Mannose 4, 6-dehydratase Structure = The enzyme contains four different subunits.

Set in seventeenth-century Hanover, it depicts the doomed romance between Philip Christoph von K√∂nigsmarck and Sophia Dorothea of Celle, the wife of the Elector of Hanover. The saraband mentioned in the title is a type of Spanish dance. Jim Morahan, William Kellner and Michael Relph were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction - Set Decoration, Color. It was the first Ealing Studios film shot in colour. Plot summary In 1682, Sophie Dorothea (Joan Greenwood) has an arranged marriage at age sixteen to Prince George Louis of Hanover and both parties are very unhappy with this political tryst. She seeks solace from dashing Count Philip Konigsmark (Stewart Granger) when her husband Prince George Louis (Peter Bull), later to become King George I of Great Britain, wants nothing to do with her.

Reception =Critical= George MacDonald Fraser, writing in 1988, said of the film,\\"Saraband tells the story [of Sophia and Konigsmark] with complete fidelity, and only the smallest of romantic touches, and makes an enthralling film of it. Stewart Granger (Konigsmark) was born for this kind of costume picture, and Joan Greenwood is an appealing Sophia. ... Best of all, the film conveys in a few brief scenes, the stifling monotony of court life in a pretentious little German state; in this too, Saraband is good history.\\" =Box Office= The film was a box office disappointment. Michael Relph later said \\"it was a magnificent looking film, but it wasn't a success at the time. We were trying to get away from the Gainsborough-type romantic costume picture, which was totally unreal, and to do a serious historical epic. I think the public probably wasn't ready for it and also it ended up being a bit heavy.\\"Brian MacFarlane, An Autobiography of British Cinema, Methuen 1997 p 482 =Awards= The acclaimed production design and art direction (nominated for an Academy Award) was complemented by the cinematography by Douglas Slocombe. Slocombe and the production team chose a muted style of colour filming, which was not universally praised: opinions variously described it as unusual and different, or pretentiously symbolic and leaving exterior and interior shots poorly matched.

Early life and education Thomas was born in Feltham, Middlesex into a working-class family, the daughter of Edmund R Ready, a clarinetist in a military band. Her mother, born Ethel E. Crapnell, worked as a seamstress for 'Frederick Gorringe Limited', a large department store on Buckingham Palace Road. She attended Ashford County Grammar School where she was considered to have the potential to win a scholarship to Oxford University, but she left at fifteen to work as a clerk at the Inland Revenue. Career Thomas's first full-time job, aged fifteen, circa 1936, was as a clerk at the Inland Revenue. During the Second World War she worked in the National Fire Service. =Music and broadcasting= In 1946 Thomas embarked on a career as a musician and singer when she joined the chorus at Covent Garden and took small roles as a light mezzo-soprano. She branched out into session singing, joined the George Mitchell Minstrels and became the familiar voice of many radio and television advertising jingles in the 1950s. In 1959 while recovering from cancer surgery she applied to join Mensa: her IQ was rated at 160. In 1961 she entered and won radio's Brain of Britain contest. This heralded a forty-year period as a mainstay of radio panel game quiz programmes. In 1967, after much lobbying of the producers, she joined the panel on Round Britain Quiz, regarded as the most erudite of the BBC's quiz shows, and rapidly became its most celebrated panellist. In the 1970s she co presented a BBC daytime television programme entitled The 607080 Show with Roy Hudd. Writing Her autobiography, The Bandsman's Daughter, was published in 1979. She was a columnist for Woman & Home magazine for many years. Personal Her first marriage, in 1940, was to John Wesley Baldry, but they divorced in 1949. From 1950 until her death she was married to Eddie Thomas, a fellow singer in the chorus at Covent Garden, who later became a teacher. She was a sister-in-law of the novelist Gwyn Thomas. In 1986 she became a patron of the Polite Society, an organisation supporting good manners.

Patients present with hyperthyroidism and may be mistaken for Graves‚Äô disease, if TSH receptor positive, or thyroiditis because of absent uptake on a thyroid radionuclide uptake scan due to suppression of thyroid function by exogenous thyroid hormones. Ingestion of thyroid hormone also suppresses thyroglobulin levels helping to differentiate thyrotoxicosis factitia from other causes of hyperthyroidism, in which serum thyroglobulin is elevated. Caution, however, should be exercised in interpreting thyroglobulin results without thyroglobulin antibodies, since thyroglobulin antibodies commonly interfere in thyroglobulin immunoassays causing false positive and negative results which may lead to clinical misdirection.

Its natural habitat is by streams and creeks between elevation. Description The tree is slim in profile, and can grow in tightly packed clusters.Populus angustifolia Southwest Colorado Wildflowers Its leaves are yellow-green, lanceolate (lance- shaped), and with scalloped margins. It produces catkins in the early spring. The fruiting capsules are fluffy and white. Image:Populus_angustifolia.jpgOld catkins and emerging spring leaves Taxonomy Where their ranges come into contact, this species will readily hybridize with Populus balsamifera, Populus deltoides, Populus fremontii, and Populus trichocarpa. These hybrids can form extensive populations in some regions. Due to the frequency and morphological consistency of P. angustifolia √ó P. deltoides hybrids, they were initially described as a fully separate species (\\"P. acuminata\\") until its hybrid origin was firmly established in the 1980s.

This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism as it is involved in the 6th step of histidine biosynthesis as part of a nine step cyclical pathway. There are two isoforms of IGPD; IGPD1 and IGPD2. The different isoforms are highly conserved with only 8 amino acids differing between them. These subtle differences however affect their activity but as yet it is unknown how. In most organisms IGPD is a monofunctional protein of about 22 to 29 kD. In some bacteria such as Escherichia coli, it is the C-terminal domain of a bifunctional protein that include a histidinol- phosphatase domain. In E. coli, this is the protein encoded by the hisB gene.  Inhibition  Certain compounds that inhibit IGPD have been used as herbicides as animals do not have this protein. One of these inhibitors is 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), which has also been used as a competitive inhibitor of the product of the yeast HIS3 gene (another IGPD), e.g. in the yeast two-hybrid system.

Based on the story \\"Gentlemen After Midnight\\" by Maurice Hanline, with a screenplay by Casey Robinson, the film is about a couple who have postponed their marriage eleven times and who continue to plot and scheme their way to marriage. The film marked the third on-screen pairing of Leslie Howard and Bette Davis, following Of Human Bondage and The Petrified Forest. Plot Basil Underwood and Joyce Arden are an egotistical acting team known for their romantic scenes on stage and fiery temperaments off. Although they deeply love each other, their frequent spats over the years have kept them from tying the knot. Comic complications ensue when Basil postpones their latest marriage plans in order to attempt to diminish the ardor of star-struck heiress Marcia West at the request of her fianc√© Henry Grant. When Basil's boorish behavior fails to bother Marcia, who is all-too-willing to submit to his charms, he begins to capitalize on her infatuation with him, much to Joyce's dismay. The screenplay allows Leslie Howard to draw on his classical background by having his character quote lines from Macbeth, Hamlet, The Taming of the Shrew, and Romeo and Juliet.

Mills as Second Butler (as Thomas Mills) * Irving Bacon as Elevator Operator (uncredited) Production Leslie Howard originally envisioned either Gertrude Lawrence or Ina Claire, both noted for their comedic stage performances, as his leading lady, although they had limited experience in films. Producer Hal B. Wallis had director Archie Mayo meet with Lawrence, who was interested in playing the role, but when Wallis and Howard screened the 1936 British film Men Are Not Gods, they agreed she did not photograph well.It's Love I'm After at Turner Classic Movies The film began production without a leading lady. Then Wallis decided the screwball comedy would be a refreshing change-of-pace for Bette Davis, who had just completed the melodrama That Certain Woman. She initially declined the role of Joyce Arden, feeling the better female role was that of socialite Marcia West. She also resented being asked to accept second billing to Howard. Suffering from exhaustion, Davis went to Palm Springs to recuperate and finally agreed to appear in the film if Wallis would allow her some time for rest and relaxation. He insisted she report to work on March 28, 1937, and she replied, \\"Give me a week more . . . I must have a brief chance of being something more than a jittery old woman.\\"Higham, Charles, The Life of Bette Davis. New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1981. , p. 101 She also asked Wallis to replace cinematographer James Van Trees with Tony Gaudio, one of the few cameramen she trusted, and the producer agreed, although Van Trees received sole screen credit. Reception Time described the film as \\"refreshing, impudent fun: a buoyant cinema making faces at its precise old aunt, the theatre.\\"Time review In his review in Allmovie, Craig Butler called the film \\"unjustly neglected\\" and \\"a delightful romp that provides an excellent showcase for the often equally neglected comedic talents of its trio of stars. While Love falls just shy of true classic status - the screenplay is slightly off the mark in a few places and its dialogue occasionally lacks the effervescent sparkle that is a requirement of the genre - it's still a little gem of a picture with an abundance of laughs . . . a great pick-me-up and well worth searching out.\\" Channel 4 called the film \\"fast-moving and thoroughly enjoyable.\\"Channel 4 review Musical adaptation It's Love I'm After is the basis of a stage musical comedy called Madly in Love, which interpolates songs by Vernon Duke with lyrics by Ira Gershwin, E.Y.

She is known for her \\"breath and energy orgasm\\" techniques, which she says are \\"orgasms you can have using your imagination and your breath.\\" Carrellas learned the technique during the height of the AIDS epidemic as a way for people to orgasm without physical contact.

Indices of multiple deprivation (IMD) are widely-used datasets within the UK to classify the relative deprivation (essentially a measure of poverty) of small areas. Multiple components of deprivation are weighted with different strengths and compiled into a single score of deprivation. The calculation and publication of the indices is devolved and indices of multiple deprivation for Wales, Scotland, England, and Northern Ireland are calculated separately. While the components of deprivation that make up the overall deprivation score are similar in all four nations of the UK the weights assigned to each component, the size of the geographies for which deprivation scores are calculated, and the years of calculation are different. As a result levels of deprivation cannot be easily compared between nations. The geography at which IMDs are produced varies across the nations of the UK and has varied over time. Currently the smallest geography for which IMDs are published is LSOA level in both England and Wales, data zone level for Scotland, and Super Output Area (SOA) for Northern Ireland. Early versions of the English IMDs were published at electoral ward and English local authority level. The use of IMDs in social analysis aims to balance the desire for a single number describing the concept of deprivation in a place and the recognition that deprivation has many interacting components. IMDs may be an improvement over simpler measures of deprivation such as low average household disposable income because they capture variables such as the advantage of access to a good school and the disadvantage of exposure to high levels of air pollution. A potential disadvantage is that the choice of components and the weighting of those components in the construction of the overall multiple deprivation score is unavoidably subjective. Components of deprivation In the current English Indices of Deprivation 2019 (IoD2019) seven domains of deprivation are considered and weighted as follows, * Income. (22.5%) * Employment. (22.5%) * Education. (13.5%) * Health. (13.5%) * Crime. (9.3%) *Barriers to Housing and Services. (9.3%) * Living Environment. (9.3%) These domains each have multiple components. For example the Barriers to Housing and Services considers seven components including levels of household overcrowding, homelessness, housing affordability, and the distance by road to four types of key amenity (post office, primary school, supermarket, and GP surgery). Responsibility for production Responsibility for the production of publication of IMDs varies by the nation that they cover. Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) publishes IMDs for Northern Ireland. StatsWales publishes IMDs for Wales. The Scottish Government publishes IMDs for Scotland. The UK Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) publishes IMDs for England. Early version of English IMDs were produced by the Social Disadvantage Research Group at the University of Oxford.  List of UK deprivation indexes  The most recent IMDs for the four nations of the UK are, *Northern Ireland Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017 (NIMDM2017). *English Indices of Deprivation 2019. *Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) 2020. *Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation (WIMD) 2019. Previous versions include, *English indices of deprivation 2000. *English indices of deprivation 2004 (ID2004) *English indices of deprivation 2007 (ID2007) Other deprivation indexes Other deprivation indexes, or similar indexes that measure properties of society linked to deprivation, are used for different analysis.

Goldhagen examines the Roman Catholic Church's role in the Holocaust and offers a review of scholarship in English addressing what he argues is antisemitism throughout the history of the Church, which he claims contributed substantially to the persecution of the Jews during World War II. Goldhagen recommends several significant steps that might be taken by the Church to make reparation for its alleged role. A Moral Reckoning received mixed reviews and was the subject of considerable controversy regarding allegations of inaccuracies and anti-Catholic bias.For further examples, see Critical reception. Background Goldhagen, the son of a Holocaust survivor, first engaged in serious academic discourse concerning the Holocaust following a lecture he attended as a student at Harvard University in 1983. He gained prominence in the field with the publication of 1996's Hitler's Willing Executioners, which met acclaim and controversy, particularly in Germany. The Journal for German and International Politics awarded him the Democracy Prize in 1997. In awarding the prize for the first time since 1990, the Journal wrote \\"Because of the penetrating quality and the moral power of his presentation, Daniel Goldhagen has greatly stirred the consciousness of the German public.\\" Invited by The New Republic to review several books concerning Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust, Goldhagen was inspired to write a review of the literature concerning the question of the \\"culture of antisemitism\\" in the Catholic Church prior to Vatican II and its impact on the Holocaust.Dietrich, Donald. \\"Review\\" . bc.edu Accessed January 4, 2008. His impressions first appeared as a lengthy essay in the January 21, 2002, edition of The New Republic entitled \\"What Would Jesus Have Done? Pope Pius XII, the Catholic Church, and the Holocaust\\" before their publication by Knopf in extended book form as A Moral Reckoning. Overview In The New York Times, book reviewer Geoffrey Wheatcroft said that A Moral Reckoning (2003) presents an indictment of the Roman Catholic Church comparable to Goldhagen's indictment of Germany in Hitler's Willing Executioners (1996), saying: \\"both as an international institution under the leadership of Pope Pius XII (1939‚Äì58), and at national levels in many European countries, the Church was deeply implicated in the appalling genocide.... Just as Germans had been carefully taught to hate the Jews, to the point that they could readily torment and kill them, so had Catholics\\"; that author Goldhagen \\"sees a deep vein of Jew-hatred ingrained within Catholic tradition; and he does not think that there was any difference of kind, between that old religious Jew-hatred and the murderous racial antisemitism of the twentieth century\\". In 2003, in The Atlantic magazine, interviewer Jennie Rothenberg Gritz quoted Goldhagen saying that \\"moral issues\\" are the \\"principal substance\\" of A Moral Reckoning, that his concern was a \\"consideration of culpability and repair\\". In a letter to the editor of The New York Times, Goldhagen said that \\"the book's real content\\" is in \\"setting forth general principles for moral repair from which I derive concrete proposals for the Church\\".Goldhagen, Daniel Jonah. (December 15, 2002). \\"'A Moral Reckoning'\\" Letters to the Books editor, The New York Times. Accessed January 5, 2008. Donald Dietrich, author of God and Humanity in Auschwitz: Jewish-Christian Relations and Sanctioned Murder, and a Boston College professor of Theology specializing in Holocaust studies, said that Goldhagen \\"asks the Catholic Church a question: 'What must a religion of love and goodness do to confront its history of hatred and harm, to make amends with its victims, and to right itself so that it is no longer the source of hatred and harm that, whatever its past, it would no longer endorse?' He has attempted to analyze the moral culpability of Catholics and their leaders, to judge the actors, and to discern how today's Catholics can make material, political and moral restitution.\\" Goldhagen's book suggests that the Church owes financial reparation and support to Jews and the State of Israel and should change its doctrine and the accepted Biblical canon to excise statements he labels as antisemitic and to indicate that \\"The Jews' way to God is as legitimate as the Christian way.\\" Failing this, the author proposes disclaimers in every Christian Bible to annotate antisemitic passages and acknowledge them as having led to injury against Jews. Legal controversy In 2002, the book's German publisher‚ÄîSiedler Verlag, a sister company of Random House‚Äîwas sued by the archdiocese of Munich as a result of the misidentification of a photograph, falsely asserting the presence of Michael Cardinal von Faulhaber, whom Rabbi David G. Dalin calls \\"a famous opponent of the Nazis\\", at a Nazi rally. The picture actually depicted Apostolic Nuncio to Germany Cesare Orsenigo participating in a May Day labor parade in Munich‚Äînot a Nazi rally in Berlin.Rychlak, Ronald J.

Apostolic Nuncio to Germany Cesare Orsenigo with Adolf Hitler and Joachim von Ribbentrop In October 2002, the district court of Munich required the publisher to withdraw the book or correct the copies, but in spite of the disclosure of the error in Germany, the book was released in English by Knopf with the error intact. A representative of the archdiocese said with regards to the mislabeled photograph that \\"The implication is that Cardinal Faulhaber was an associate of the Nazis. When one writes about these things, one should be more precise about the truth.\\" Goldhagen, who acknowledged that the photo wrongly identified the figure and location, described the lawsuit as a crude diversionary tactic to displace focus from the real issues. Goldhagen stated that the photograph was misidentified by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, from which the picture was obtained.Eddy, Melissa. (October 11, 2002) \\"German Holocaust censorship alleged\\". AP. CBS News. Accessed April 6, 2008. Religious commentator and former priest Paul Collins characterized the mislabeling of the photograph as inexcusable, while The New York Times reported that most historians agreed that \\"a single mislabeled photo in a 346-page book is a minor error.\\" Critical reception Although A Moral Reckoning was favorably reviewed in The Spectator, Kirkus Reviews, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and given a generally favorable overview ahead of an interview in The Atlantic, it was also subject to substantial criticism, even among some of those reviewers who found aspects of the work praiseworthy. The International Social Science Review, which described the book as a \\"seminal work\\" and a \\"valuable introduction to and synthesis of the literature on church and state during the Holocaust\\", also indicated that the message of the book is \\"diluted by stylistic problems\\".Green, Harol M.

The New York Times reviewer Geoffrey Wheatcroft praised Goldhagen's assembly of \\"an impressive body of evidence\\" but criticized his repetitiveness, his \\"misinterpreting the record\\" and his use of it to promote a particular view, which Wheatcroft deems appropriate for an advocate but reprehensible in a historian. Dietrich, whose review lauded Goldhagen for asking \\"many of the proper seminal questions\\", mirrored Wheatcroft's concerns about repetitiveness, misunderstandings and polemics, specifically stating: \\"The careful reader must closely read the footnotes since in many cases he contextually and theologically nuances his book's claims only there.\\" Pope Pius XI John Cornwell, author of Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII (1999), praised Daniel Goldhagen's \\"excellent job in exposing the propagandistic hagiography of recent defenders of Pius XII, especially their tendency to confuse diplomatic eulogy with historical fact\\", but said that Goldhagen errs in identifying a key Vatican figure as an antisemite, a misrepresentation he thinks \\"can only provide ammunition for the Pius XII lobby\\".In 2004, Cornwell said about his work Hitler's Pope, that subsequent evidence and debate had convinced him that Pius XII had such \\"little scope of action\\" as to render it \\"impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war\\".

Roth, who favorably reviewed A Moral Reckoning in the Los Angeles Times, said that the adjectives \\"unpretentious ... indecisive ... moderate ... patient\\" do not come to mind when reading Goldhagen. Another book review in The New York Times said that A Moral Reckoning is an \\"impressive and disturbing bill of indictment against\\" the Roman Catholic Church, yet its imbalanced perspective results in \\"turning history into a kind of cudgel\\". In summer of 2002, before its publication, Ronald Rychlak, author of Hitler, the War, and the Pope, decried it as factually incorrect, releasing a lengthy catalog of corrections to Goldhagen's essay \\"What Would Jesus Have Done?\\" After the book's publication, Rychlak published a review in the journal Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions, again pointing out factual errors and criticizing the book's tone and conclusions. Following the book's publication, Rabbi Dalin and Joseph Bottum, later co-authors along with William Doino of The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII,See Doino, William; Joseph Bottum and David G. Dalin (November 28, 2004). The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII.

In his review, Paul Collins indicated that the purpose of the book was undermined by poor editing, incoherence and redundancy. Mark Riebling of National Review, who described himself as an admirer of Goldhagen's first book, called A Moral Reckoning \\"a 352-page exercise in intellectual bad manners\\" and \\"a spree of intellectual wilding\\". In reply to the charge of historical inaccuracy, Daniel Goldhagen said that the \\"central contours\\" of A Moral Reckoning: The Role of the Catholic Church in the Holocaust and its Unfulfilled Duty of Repair (2002) are accurate, because the book's title and first page communicate its purpose of moral analysis, not historical analysis. He stated that he has invited to no avail European Church representatives to present their own historical account in discussing morality and reparation. Opponents labelled Goldhagen as a \\"anti-Catholic\\", as promoting an anti-Catholic agenda. Bottum wrote that its \\"errors of fact combine to create a set of historical theses about the Nazis and the Catholic Church so tendentious that not even Pius XII's most determined belittlers have dared to assert them. And, in Goldhagen's final chapters, the bad historical theses unite to form a complete anti-Catholicism the likes of which we haven't seen since the elderly H. G. Wells decided Catholicism was the root of all evil\\". In the Catholic News Service, Eugene J. Fisher, the Associate Director of the Secretariat for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that Goldhagen avoided original research, as \\"such methodological and factual considerations would definitely get in the way of the demonic portrait of the Church that he seeks to paint\\".Fisher, Eugene J. \\"Review of A Moral Reckoning\\" Written for Catholic News Service.

Predator defense mechanism Cabbage aphids produce a myrosinase (beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) enzyme in head and thoracic muscles; the aphids also uptake glucosinolates, particularly sinigrin, from the plants on which they feed, storing the glucosinolates in their haemolymph. (Glucosinolates are natural defenses for plants in the order Brassicales against pests and herbivores.) The combination of the glucosinolates and the myrosinase enzyme produces a violent chemical reaction that releases the mustard oil chemical allyl isothiocyanate.Imperial College London (2007, July 12).

The chemical defence of the aphids has been likened to a \\"walking mustard oil bomb\\". The myrosinase from Brevicoryne brassicae appears to have evolved separately from myrosinases found in plants, possibly a case of convergent evolution.

He was particularly noted in Mozart, Beethoven and in early 20th-century German repertoire. Biography Julius Patzak was born in Vienna and originally studied conducting. He was also taught composition, by Franz Schmidt, Guido Adler and Eusebius Mandyczewski. It was in 1926 that he decided instead upon a career as a singer, and he made his debut as Radames in Aida at Reichenberg in that year. He sang regularly at the Munich State Opera from 1928 to 1945, and at Vienna from 1946 to 1960. He appeared in London at Covent Garden in 1938 as Tamino in The Magic Flute, alternating with Richard Tauber, and again several times after the war, notably as Florestan in Fidelio. This role and the title role in Hans Pfitzner's opera Palestrina were considered to be among his finest roles. In the latter he was pre-eminent among the followers of his Munich predecessor Karl Erb. Patzak appeared in a number of operatic premieres, notably Richard Strauss's Friedenstag, Carl Orff's Der Mond and Gottfried von Einem's Dantons Tod. Patzak sang the role of Gabriel von Eisenstein, a rich banker, in the recording of Die Fledermaus, with Clemens Krauss conducting the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, issued by London Records LLP 305. Although he did not possess the most powerful of voices, it had a distinctive and attractive timbre and was used with such style, intelligence, charm and musicianship, and with such dramatic conviction, as to warrant a very high place among the operatic singers of his time. He was the very effective partner of Kathleen Ferrier in the recording of Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde under Bruno Walter, issued by Decca Records in 1952. He was awarded the Lilli Lehmann Medal in 1950. Patzak died on 26 January 1974, at Rottach-Egern in Bavaria, aged 75.

As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and . Methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) is a 152-amino acid homohexamer that has a molecular weight of approximately 67,000 kD. The total solvent-accessible surface area of the MGS homohexamer is 18,510 square Angstroms, roughly 40% of the total possible surface area if the subunits were separated. Each monomer consists of five alpha helices surrounding five beta sheets. Of these, two antiparallel beta sheets and one alpha helix are located in a subdomain where the N-terminus and C-terminus are in close juxtaposition. The homohexamer exhibits a threefold axis perpendicular to a twofold axis. Within the wide V-groove, there are twelve hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges between the monomers in the presence of phosphate binding. In the absence of phosphate binding, ten hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges hold the monomers together. At the peak interfaces, ten hydrogen bonds and no salt bridges connect the monomers regardless of phosphate binding. The MGS homohexamer is slightly asymmetrical. All three monomers within the asymmetrical region contain a formate molecule within their respective actives sites. Only one of the monomers within the asymmetrical region is additionally bound to a phosphate. The active site contains many conserved residues for function (Asp, His, Thr) and structure (Gly, Pro). Inorganic phosphate interacts with Lys23, Thr45, Thr47, Thr48, and Gly66. Formate interacts with His19, His98, and Asp71. The active site is exposed to the solvent via a perpendicular channel that consists of Arg150, Tyr146, Asp20, Pro67, His98, and His19. Although mechanistically similar to triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), MGS contains widely dissimilar protein folding that prevents structural alignment with TIM which suggests convergent evolution of their chemical reactions. However, Asp71 in MGS may act similarly to the Glu165, the catalytic base in TIM. Additionally, His19 and His98 may perform the role of the electrophilic catalyst similar to His95 in TIM. CheB methylesterase has the highest structural similarity with MGS. Mechanism Methylglyoxal synthase is highly specific for DHAP with Km 0.47mM at its optimal pH of 7.5. Contrary to early reports, the purified enzyme does not react with other glycolytic metabolites such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate or fructose 1,6-diphosphate. The mechanism of MGS is similar to that of TIM; both enzymes react with dihydroxyacetone phosphate to form an ene-diol phosphate intermediate as the first step of their reaction pathways. However, the second step involves the elimination of phosphate to form methylglyoxal instead of reprotonation to form glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The overall reaction is characterized as an intramolecular oxidation-reduction followed by a dephosphorylation. The C-3 of DHAP is oxidized to an aldehyde, while C-1, which bears the phosphate ester, is dephosphorylated and reduced to a methyl group. MGS does not require the use of metal ions or a Schiff base as part of catalysis. Methylglyoxal synthase arrow-pushing mechanism. The enzyme first uses Asp71 to specifically abstract the pro-S hydrogen from the C-3 of DHAP to form an ene- diol(ate)-enzyme intermediate, unlike the abstraction of C-3 pro-R hydrogen in TIM by Glu165. A second base deprotonates the hydroxyl group, leading to the collapse of the en-diol(ate) to form the 2-hydroxy 2-propenal enol intermediate along with dissociation of inorganic phosphate (‚ÄìOPO) through the cleavage of a C-O bond rather than an O-P bond. This deprotonation is catalyzed by either Asp71 or Asp101. Protonation of the methylene group of the enolate is non-stereospecific. The reaction products are released sequentially with methylglyoxal leaving before the inorganic phosphate. MGS is responsible for the racemic mixture of lactate in cells; the production of methylglyoxal and its further metabolism yields L-(+)-lactate and D-(-)-lactate, while deletion of the MGS gene leads to observation of optically pure D-(-)-lactate. Regulation Binding of phosphate to the enzyme increases its cooperativity via structural changes that open three DHAP-binding sites. At higher concentrations, however, phosphate acts as a competitive allosteric inhibitor to turn off enzymatic activity, suggesting that diversion to methylglyoxal production occurs under conditions of phosphate starvation. This inhibition is believed to be caused by bound phosphate and formate mimicking the reaction intermediates (enolate and inorganic phosphate). Additionally, phosphate binding causes rotation of threonine residues that close the active site. Ser55 in the active site of MGS is responsible for discriminating the binding of an inorganic phosphate from the phosphate group of the substrate (DHAP) by hydrogen bonding and undergoing a conformational change of location. Transmittance of the allosteric signal is determined to pass through Arg97 and Val101 because none of these are located in the active site, yet mutations at these residues negates any inhibitory effect of phosphate binding. Pro82 is necessary to transmit the signal from one subunit to the Ar97 and Val101 of another subunit. The induction of salt-bridge formation between Asp10 and Arg140 is an additional inter-subunit signal transmission pathway for organisms that retain the last 10 amino acids of the monomer peptide. The final acceptor of this allosteric signal is the catalytic Gly56 within the active site. Inorganic pyrophosphate has 95% the ability of phosphate in inhibiting MGS. 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate also have 50% and 70% inhibition, respectively. 2-phosphoglycolate also acts as a competitive inhibitor by mimicking the ene-diolate intermediate. ATP has been shown to have weak inhibition in some bacterial strains. The reaction product, methylglyoxal, does not exhibit any feedback inhibition on MGS. Biological function Methylglyoxal synthase provides an alternative catabolic pathway for triose phosphates created in glycolysis. It has activity levels similar to that of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from glycolysis, suggesting an interplay between the two enzymes in the breakdown of triose phosphates. Indeed, MGS is strongly inhibited by phosphate concentrations that are close to the Km of phosphate serving as substrate for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and is, therefore, inactive at normal intracellular conditions. Triose phosphate catabolism switches over to MGS when phosphate concentrations are too low for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity. In situations when glycolysis is restricted by phosphate starvation, the switch to MGS serves to release phosphate from glycolytic metabolites for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and to produce methylglyoxal, which is converted to pyruvate via lactate with the uncoupling of ATP synthesis. This interplay between the two enzymes allows the cell to shift triose catabolism between the formation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate and methylglyoxal based on available phosphates. Other applications For fuel ethanol production, complete metabolism of complex combinations of sugars in E. coli by synthetic biocatalysts is necessary. Deletion of the methylglyoxal synthase gene in E. coli increases fermentation rate of ethanogenic E. coli by promoting the co-metabolism of sugar mixtures containing the five principal sugars found in biomass (glucose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, and mannose). This suggests that MGS production of methylglyoxal plays a role in controlling expression of sugar-specific transporters and catabolic genes in native E.coli. MGS also has industrial importance in the production of lactate, hydroxyacetone (acetol), and 1,2-propandiol. Introduction of the MGS gene in bacteria that natively lack MGS increased useful production of 1,2-propandiol by 141%. For biotechnological and synthetic applications, phosphate binding helps to stabilize and protect the enzyme against cold- and heat-induced denaturation. His-His interaction via the insertion of one histidine residue between Arg22 and His23 is also known to confer greater thermostability by increasing its half-life 4.6-fold.

The incident was announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, on 20 November 2007. The two discs contained the personal details of all families in the United Kingdom (UK) claiming child benefit, of which takeup in the UK is near 100%.  The loss  The discs were sent by junior staff at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) based at Waterview Park in Washington, Tyne and Wear, to the National Audit Office (NAO), as unrecorded internal mail via TNT on 18 October. On 24 October the NAO complained to the HMRC that they had not received the data. On 8 November, senior officials in HMRC were informed of the loss, with Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling being informed on 10 November. On 20 November Darling announced: The lost data was thought to concern approximately 25 million people in the UK (nearly half of the country's population). The personal data on the missing discs was reported to include names and addresses of parents and children and dates of birth of the children, together with the National Insurance numbers and bank or building society details of their parents. The \\"password protection\\" in question is that provided by WinZip version 8. This is a weak, proprietary scheme (unnamed encryption and hash algorithms) with well-known attacks. Anyone competent in computing would be able to break this protection by downloading readily- available tools. WinZip version 9 introduced AES encryption, which would have been secure and only breakable by correctly knowing the passphrase. In a list of frequently asked questions, on the BBC News website a breakdown of the loss was reported as being: * 7.25 million claimants * 15.5 million children, including some who no longer qualify but whose family is claiming for a younger child * 2.25 million 'alternative payees' such as partners or carers * 3,000 'appointees' who claim the benefit under court instructions * 12,500 agents who claim the benefit on behalf of a third party Whilst government ministers claimed that a junior official was to blame, the Conservatives said that the fault lay in part with senior management. This was based on a claim that the National Audit Office had requested that bank details be removed from the data before it was sent, but that HMRC had denied this request, because it would be \\"too costly and complicated\\". Emails released on 22 November confirmed that senior HMRC officials had been made aware of the decision on cost grounds not to strip out sensitive information.Email from HMRC to NAO, 13 March 2007.

Retrieved on 20 December 2007. According to an IT trade journal Computer Weekly, it said that back in March 2007, the NAO had asked for completed information of the child benefit database to be sent by post on CDs, instead of a sample of the database. The first time this was done, things went smoothly, and the package was registered post. However this time, it was unregistered through the courier. It was later revealed, on 17 December 2007, that the data protection manual for HMRC was in itself under restriction to only senior members of staff, not junior civil servants who had just a summary of what the manual says on security. =Other data scandals = This was followed by several other data scandals. On 17 December it was revealed by Ruth Kelly that the details of three million learner drivers were lost in the United States. However the only details said to be lost were the: name, address, phone number, the fee paid, the test centre, payment code and e-mail, so not much of a panic was caused due to a reduced risk of financial fraud. On 23 December it was revealed that nine NHS trusts had also lost the data of hundreds of thousands of patients, some of it archive information, some of it medical records, contact details and soft financial data. A few other trusts also lost data, but found it fairly quickly. Several other UK firms have also admitted security failings. Response  Darling stated that there was no indication that the details had fallen into criminal hands, but he urged those affected to monitor their bank accounts. He said \\"If someone is the innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident, people can be assured they have protection under the Banking Code so they will not suffer any financial loss as a result.\\" HMRC then set up a Child Benefit Helpline for those concerned about the data loss. The incident was a breach of the UK's Data Protection Act and resulted in the resignation of HMRC chairman Paul Gray; Darling commented that the discs were probably destroyed when \\"the hunt was on, probably within days\\" and that there was an \\"opaque\\" management structure at HMRC and it was difficult to see who was responsible for what. Gray was subsequently found to be working at Cabinet Office.http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/politics/domestic_politics/paul+gray+back+at+work/1136847 The Metropolitan Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission both investigated the security breach, and uniformed police officers investigated HMRC offices. The loss led to much criticism by the Acting Leader of the Liberal Democrats Vince Cable and Shadow Chancellor George Osborne. Osborne said: In addition he said that it was the \\"final blow for the ambitions of this government to create a national ID database\\". Cable also criticised the use of disks in the modern age of electronic data transfer. Spokespersons for Gordon Brown, however, said that the Prime Minister fully supported Darling, and said that Darling had not expressed any intention to resign. The general reaction of the public was one of anger and worry. Banks, individuals, businesses and government departments became more vigilant over data fraud and identity theft and the government pledged to be more careful with data. The public and media was particularly angry over the fact that the data was not registered or recorded, and that it was not securely encrypted. Nick Assinder, a political correspondent at the BBC, expressed the opinion that he believed Darling to be \\"on borrowed time\\". George Osborne, who questioned whether Darling was \\"up to the job\\", suggested that it would be a matter of days before a decision was made regarding Darling's future.Ministers under fire over records BBC News retrieved November 21, 2007 However Darling remained Chancellor until Labour's defeat in 2010.

However, Uro≈°eviƒá decided to leave the band (Zdravkoviƒá and Nikoliƒá also leaving with him). Pantoviƒá and Jakovljeviƒá continued to perform as Osvajaƒçi (although the band is essentially a continuation of All Stars Osvajaƒçi, as it features the guitarist Bane Jeliƒá, who was the third member of All Stars Osvajaƒçi).

It was held in Kampala, Uganda, between 23 November and 25 November 2007, and was hosted by President Yoweri Museveni. The meeting was attended by representatives of forty-eight countries out of the Commonwealth's fifty-three members (suspended members Fiji and Pakistan, and special member Nauru were not invited, whilst Saint Lucia and Vanuatu sent no representatives). Thirty-six were represented by their Head of State or Head of Government. Membership criteria Kampala saw the completion of a review of the Commonwealth's membership criteria, launched at the 2005 CHOGM in Valletta, with the publication of the report of the Committee on Commonwealth Membership. It had already been announced that no new members would be admitted until the 2009 CHOGM. In this context, Rwanda was discussed at great lengths, with Rwanda's President, Paul Kagame, invited to Kampala as neighbour Uganda's guest. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) reimposed the suspension on Pakistan that had been lifted in 2005 on the eve of the CHOGM. Opposed vehemently by Sri Lanka, the move seemed to indicate a more assertive role for CMAG since the premature lifting of the suspension on Pakistan two years earlier. Since Pakistan's suspension and Zimbabwe's withdrawal, CMAG had seen little use, and the more commanding chairmanship of Malta's Michael Frendo marked a change in tone. The new CMAG, elected at the CHOGM, saw Canada, Lesotho, and Tanzania replaced by Namibia, New Zealand, and Uganda. Secretary-General At the CHOGM, a new Commonwealth Secretary-General had to be elected, to replace New Zealander Don McKinnon, who had been Secretary-General since 2000. The two contenders were Kamalesh Sharma of India and Michael Frendo. With Frendo having suspended Pakistan, it seemed as though the India-Pakistan rivalry would come to the fore once again. However, Frendo withdrew his candidacy before the vote, leaving Sharma to be appointed unanimously and become the first Asian Secretary-General: leaving Europe as the only continent having not held the position. The CHOGM was also marked by the appearance of Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Whilst he took no role in official proceedings, his attendance marked the Prince's first involvement in CHOGMs, having previously distanced himself from Commonwealth affairs. This sparked rumours that Charles was actively courting Commonwealth leaders in anticipation of the choice of successor to Queen Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth (a position that is vested in the Queen personally, and does not pass automatically with the British crown).

Pectate lyase is responsible for the eliminative cleavage of pectate, yielding oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-Œ±-D-mann-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends. The protein is maximally expressed late in pollen development. It has been suggested that the pollen expression of pectate lyase genes might relate to a requirement for pectin degradation during pollen tube growth. This enzyme catalyzes the chemical reaction :Eliminative cleavage of (1‚Üí4)-Œ±-D-galacturonan to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-Œ±-D- galact-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends The structure and the folding kinetics of one member of this family, pectate lyase C (pelC)1 from Erwinia chrysanthemi has been investigated in some detail,. PelC contains a parallel beta-helix folding motif. The majority of the regular secondary structure is composed of parallel beta-sheets (about 30%). The individual strands of the sheets are connected by unordered loops of varying length. The backbone is then formed by a large helix composed of beta-sheets. There are two disulphide bonds in PelC and 12 proline residues. One of these prolines, Pro220, is involved in a cis peptide bond. The folding mechanism of PelC involves two slow phases that have been attributed to proline isomerization. Some of the proteins in this family are allergens. Allergies are hypersensitivity reactions of the immune system to specific substances called allergens (such as pollen, synthetic materials, dust, stings, drugs, or food) that, in most people, result in no symptoms. A nomenclature system has been established for antigens (allergens) that cause IgE-mediated atopic allergies in humans.WHO/IUIS Allergen Nomenclature Subcommittee (King TP, Hoffmann D, Loewenstein H, Marsh DG, Platts-Mills TAE, Bull TW). World Health Organ. 72:797‚Äì806 (1994). This nomenclature system is defined by a designation that is composed of the first three letters of the genus; a space; the first letter of the species name; a space and an Arabic number. In the event that two species names have identical designations, they are discriminated from one another by adding one or more letters (as necessary) to each species designation. The allergens in this family include allergens with the following designations: Amb a 1, Amb a 2, Amb a 3, Cha o 1, Cup a 1, Cry j 1, Jun a 1. Two of the major allergens in the pollen of short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) are Amb a I and Amb a II. The primary structure of Amb a II has been deduced and has been shown to share ~65% sequence identity with the Amb a I multigene family of allergens. Members of the Amb a I/a II family include Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum, Common tobacco) pectate lyase, which is similar to the deduced amino acid sequences of two pollen-specific pectate lyase genes identified in Lycopersicon esculentum (Tomato); Cry j I, a major allergenic glycoprotein of Cryptomeria japonica (Japanese cedar)‚Äîthe most common pollen allergen in Japan; and P56 and P59, which share sequence similarity with pectate lyases of plant pathogenic bacteria. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on polysaccharides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1->4)-alpha-D-galacturonan lyase. Other names in common use include polygalacturonic transeliminase, pectic acid transeliminase, polygalacturonate lyase, endopectin methyltranseliminase, pectate transeliminase, endogalacturonate transeliminase, pectic acid lyase, pectic lyase, alpha-1,4-D-endopolygalacturonic acid lyase, PGA lyase, PPase-N, endo- alpha-1,4-polygalacturonic acid lyase, polygalacturonic acid lyase, pectin trans-eliminase, and Polygalacturonic acid trans-eliminase.

Originally written in Portuguese, it became a widely translated international bestseller. An allegorical novel, The Alchemist follows a young Andalusian shepherd in his journey to the pyramids of Egypt, after having a recurring dream of finding a treasure there. Plot The Alchemist follows the journey of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago. Believing a recurring dream to be prophetic, he asks a Gypsy fortune teller in the nearby town about its meaning. The woman interprets the dream as a prophecy telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids. Early into his journey, he meets an old king named Melchizedek, or the king of Salem, who tells him to sell his sheep, so as to travel to Egypt, and introduces the idea of a Personal Legend. Your Personal Legend \\"is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is.\\"The Alchemist, HarperCollins paperback, 1998, p.21 The Pyramids of Giza Early in his arrival to Africa, a man who claims to be able to take Santiago to the pyramids instead robs him of what money he had made from selling his sheep. Santiago then embarks on a long path of working for a crystal merchant so as to make enough money to fulfill his personal legend and go to the pyramids. Along the way, the boy meets an Englishman who has come in search of an alchemist and continues his travels with his new companion. When they reach an oasis, Santiago meets and falls in love with an Arabian girl named Fatima, to whom he proposes marriage. She promises to do so only after he completes his journey. Frustrated at first, he later learns that true love will not stop nor must one sacrifice to it one's personal destiny, since to do so robs it of truth. The boy then encounters a wise alchemist who also teaches him to realize his true self. Together, they risk a journey through the territory of warring tribes, where the boy is forced to demonstrate his oneness with \\"the soul of the world\\" by turning himself into a simoom before he is allowed to proceed. When he begins digging within sight of the pyramids, he is robbed yet again, but accidentally learns from the leader of the thieves that the treasure he sought all along was in the ruined church where he had his original dream. Background Coelho wrote The Alchemist in only two weeks in 1987. He explained that he was able to write at this pace because the story was \\"already written in [his] soul.\\" The book's main theme is about finding one's destiny, although according to The New York Times, The Alchemist is \\"more self-help than literature.\\" The advice given Santiago that \\"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe will conspire so that your wish comes true\\" is the core of the novel's philosophy and a motif that plays throughout it. The Alchemist was first released by Rocco,Retrieved 2019-05-16. an obscure Brazilian publishing house. Albeit having sold \\"well,\\" the publisher after a year decided to give Coelho back the rights. Needing to \\"heal\\" himself from this setback, Coelho set out to leave Rio de Janeiro with his wife and spent 40 days in the Mojave Desert. Returning from the excursion, Coelho decided he had to keep on struggling and was \\"so convinced it was a great book that [he] started knocking on doors.\\" Adaptations In 1994, a comic adaptation was published by Alexandre Jubran. HarperOne, a HarperCollins imprint, produced an illustrated version of the novel, with paintings by the French artist M≈ìbius, but failed to convince Coelho \\"to consent to the full graphic-novel treatment.\\" The Alchemist: A Graphic Novel was published in 2010, adapted by Derek Ruiz and with artwork by Daniel Sampere. The Alchemist's Symphony by the young Walter Taieb was released in 1997 with the support of Paulo Coelho, who wrote an original text for the CD booklet. The work has eight movements and five interludes.DiscogsPerformance on YouTube In 2002, a theatrical adaptation of The Alchemist was produced and performed in London. Since then there have been several productions by the Cornish Collective. A later London performance was visited by the producer Ashvin Gidwani who, finding it ‚Äúverbose but colourful‚Äù, decided to commission a new 90-minute version of the book from Deepa Gahlot for the Indian stage.

On the cover it is referred to only as A History of the Brethren. It was republished in 1961 by L. W. Shultz from North Manchester, Indiana and Carl A. Wagner from Union Road, Clayton, Ohio, printed in February, 1961, and June, 1969.  Historical context  Throughout the 1800s, the Brethren were skeptical of histories and record-keeping, as they were not to emulate their ancestors, but rather Jesus Christ, the Apostles, and the Early Church. However, by the end of the century enough changes were occurring that the Brethren, having great respect for the Brethren that came before them, were interested in Brethren history. At the German Baptist Brethren Annual Conference, a motion was passed approving the writing of a history of the Brethren, however, the motion did not specify an author. Martin Grove Brumbaugh (M.G.) was the first to complete the task in 1899. His book had great impact, based upon the value of tradition, and the lack of knowledge about Brethren history.  Bias  Contemporary Brethren historians generally consider this history quite biased. Martin Grove Brumbaugh (M.G.) was a strong advocate for several progressive positions, especially education, participation in politics, and reconsidering plain dress, positions which the Brethren had long opposed. These historical positions are not so clear, and sometimes contradicted in M.G.'s history.

It is produced commercially for the food industry from fungi and used to destroy residual fruit starch, known as pectin, in wine and cider. In plant cell culture, it is used in combination with the enzyme cellulase to generate protoplasts by degrading the plant cell walls. Pectin lyase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :Eliminative cleavage of (1->4)-alpha-D-galacturonan methyl ester to give oligosaccharides with 4-deoxy-6-O-methyl-alpha-D- galact-4-enuronosyl groups at their non-reducing ends This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on polysaccharides.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1->4)-6-O-methyl-alpha-D-galacturonan lyase. Other names in common use include: * endo-pectin lyase, * pectin methyltranseliminase, * pectin trans- eliminase, * pectolyase, * PL, * PMGL, * PNL, and * polymethylgalacturonic transeliminase. Structural studies As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .  Biotechnology applications  Pectin lyases are the only known pectinases capable of degrading highly esterified pectins (like those found in fruits) into small molecules via Œ≤-elimination mechanism without producing methanol (which is toxic), in contrast with the combination of PG and PE, which are normally found in commercial products. In addition, the presence of undesirable enzymatic activity in commercial pectinases may be detrimental to aroma because they are responsible for producing unpleasant volatile off flavour. There are many reports of fruit juice clarification by pectin lyases. The alkaline pectinase is inappropriate for use in the food industry due to the acidic pH of fruit juices. However, they have a very high demand in the textile industries. They are used for retting of plant fibers such as ramie, sunn hemp, jute, flax and hemp. The first report on retting of sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) by pectin lyase produced by Aspergillus flavus MTCC 7589 was published in 2008 but this aspect of pectin lyases needs to be extensively investigated further.

His baptismal name was Lorenzo; he took Guglielmo as religious name. His cause of canonization has commenced the confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to name him as Venerable on 1 December 2016. Life Guglielmo Massaia was born on 9 June 1809 in Piedmont as Lorenzo Antonio Massaia. He was first educated at the Collegio Reale at Asti under the care of his elder brother Guglielmo who served as a canon and precentor of Asti Cathedral. On the death of his brother he passed as a student to the diocesan seminary in 1824; but at the age of sixteen entered the Capuchin Franciscan Order, receiving the habit on 25 September 1825. He completed studies at the seminary in 1826. He took the name of \\"Guglielmo\\" around this time. Massaia was ordained to the priesthood on 16 June 1832 in Vercelli and served as a spiritual director at a hospital in Turin from 1834 to 1836. He served also as the confessor and advisor of Giuseppe Benedetto Cottolengo - future saint. He was appointed as a lector of theology; but even whilst teaching he acquired some fame as a preacher and was chosen confessor to Prince Victor Emmanuel, afterwards King of Italy, and Ferdinand, Duke of Genoa. The royal family of Piedmont would have nominated him on several occasions to an episcopal see, but he wanted to join the foreign missions of his order. He obtained his wish in 1846. That year the Congregation of Propaganda, at the instance of the traveller Antoine d'Abbadie, determined to establish the Apostolic Vicariate of Galla for the Oromo in Ethiopia. The mission was confided to the Capuchins, and Massaia was appointed as the first vicar-apostolic. He received episcopal consecration in Rome on 24 May of that year in the church of San Carlo al Corso. On his arrival in Ethiopia in 1856, he found the country in a state of religious agitation. The titular head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Qerellos III, had been dead for about 20 years and there was a movement amongst the native Christians towards union with Rome. Massaia, who had received plenary faculties from Pope Pius IX, ordained a number of native priests for the Coptic Rite; he also obtained the appointment by the Holy See of a vicar-apostolic for the Copts, and himself consecrated the missionary Justin de Jacobis to this office. But this act aroused the enmity of the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria, who sent a bishop of his own, Abuna Salama III, to Ethiopia. As a result of the ensuing political agitation, Massaia was banished from the country and had to flee under an assumed name. In 1850 he visited Europe to gain a fresh band of missionaries and means to develop his work: he had interviews with the French Minister of Foreign Affairs in Paris, and with Lord Palmerston in London. On his return to the Oromos he founded a large number of missions; he also established a school at Marseille for the education of Oromo boys freed from slavery; besides this he composed a grammar of the Oromo language which was published at Marseilles in 1867. Massaia. During his thirty-five years as a missionary he was exiled seven times, but he always returned. However, in 1880 he was compelled by ill- health to resign his mission. In recognition of his merit, Pope Leo XIII raised him to the titular Archbishopric of Stauropolis. Leo XIII also raised him into the cardinalate in 1884 as the Cardinal-Priest of Ss. Vitale, Gervasio e Protasio. At the command of the pope he wrote an account of his missionary labours, under the title, \\"I miei trentacinque anni di missione nell' alta Etiopia\\", the first volume of which was published simultaneously at Rome and Milan in 1883, and the last in 1895. In this work he deals not only with the progress of the mission, but with the political and economic conditions of Ethiopia as he knew them. He lived his last decade at a Capuchin friary in Frascati and died on 6 August 1889 at 4:30am of cardio-circulatory collapse. His remains were buried in Frascati after the funeral on 10 August 1889, celebrated by Ignazio Perrsico, the Titular Archbishop of Damiata. Legacy In 1940 his native village of Piov√† was renamed Piov√† Massaia in his honour. In 1952, Italy issued a commemorative stamp celebrating his mission to Ethiopia.Scott Standard Postage Stamp Catalogue Italy #612, issued 21 November 1952 Many streets and buildings in Italy are named after Guglielmo Massaia, for example the Via Cardinale Guglielmo Massaia in Rome and Turin or the Museo Etiopico Guglielmo Massaia in Frascati (Rome). He was the subject of the 1939 biopic Cardinal Messias directed by Goffredo Alessandrini and starring Camillo Pilotto as Massaia. It was awarded the Mussolini Cup at the 1939 Venice Film Festival. Cause for beatification The process for beatification had its origins as far back as 1914 in which documents were collected in a diocesan process that commenced on 5 December 1941 until an unknown date. The \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) was granted on 21 July 1987 which allowed for the formal commencement of the cause of beatification and the granting of the title Servant of God. The Positio was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2014 while historians voiced their approval to the cause in a vote undertaken on 21 October 2014. Pope Francis titled him as Venerable on 1 December 2016 upon the confirmation of his life of heroic virtue.

The Clonmacnoise and West Offaly Railway was a narrow-gauge railway and former tourist attraction in the Midlands of Ireland. Primarily built as an industrial line for hauling newly cut peat, this narrow-gauge railway was operated by the peat-harvesting company Bord na M√≥na and conveyed visitors over a 9-km line running through Blackwater Bog, near Shannonbridge, County Offaly. A small diesel locomotive hauled a single 53-seat passenger coach. The railway was an important tourist attraction in County Offaly. However, it closed permanently at the end of 2008 as operation of the line was interfering with the heavy flow of peat traffic bound for the Electricity Supply Board's West Offaly Power Generation Station. Given the historic importance of peat as an indigenous Irish fuel, the railway and associated visitor services aimed to show visitors how milled peat is produced and transported to power stations, and Bord na M√≥na is investigating the provision of an alternative tourism facility for the area.

Alginate lyase cleaves the glycosidic bonds of alginate via a Œ≤-elimination mechanism, in which it first converts alginate into several oligosccharides containing unsaturated uronic acids at their non-reducing ends. It then cleaves the oligosaccharides, forming 4-deosy-L- erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid. This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on polysaccharides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is poly(beta-D-1,4-mannuronide) lyase. Other names in common use include alginate lyase I, alginate lyase, alginase I, alginase II, and alginase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.  Substrate specificity  Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that has been isolated from a variety of organisms, ranging from viruses and bacteria to fungi. It is also a major component of the cell wall in brown algae and a major source of fixed carbon for other organisms. Many organisms from which alginate lyase has been isolated are found in close association with brown algae. For example, some strains of bacteria from the Paenibacillus genus were isolated from L. japonica and S. siliquatrum, and these strains were discovered to excrete alginate lyase. While all alginate lyases have similar function, there are some variations in the type of product they form. This variation depends on the substrate specificity of the enzyme, as alginates can have M-M, G-G, or alternating M-G bonds. Therefore, some alginate lyases are G block specific, only degrading the homo-polymeric G blocks of alginate, and others are M block-specific, only degrading the homo- polymeric M blocks of alginate. Some are able to degrade both, but they may preferentially degrade one over the other. Alginate lyases can also be categorized based on their modes of action. Many are endolytic, generally allowing them to degrade alginate into unsaturated oligosaccharides. An exolytic mode of action, on the other hand, allows the enzyme to degrade alginate into monosaccharides.  Structure  As of late 2019, 15 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , 1VAV, 1UAI, 4OZX, 37PY, 4BE3, 3GNE, 5GMT, 1QAZ, 4OZV, 380O, 4NEI, and 5GKD. Alginate lyases can be categorized into different polysaccharide lyase families based on their amino acid sequences. There are 24 families, ranging from Pl-1 to PL-24, but alginate lyases are generally only found in seven: PL-5, PL-6, PL-7, PL-14, PL-17, and PL-18. The structure and amino acid sequence can help elucidate the activity of the enzyme, indicating whether it is endolytic or exolytic. Endolytic alginate lyases, like those found in the PL-7 family, have active sites which are wide open. Exolytic alginate lyases, like those found in the PL-15 family, have a catalytic groove which is blocked on one end, forming a pocket. Due to differences in the way they fold, alginate lyases can be grouped based on whether they contain a Œ≤-jelly roll, an (Œ±/Œ±)n toroid, or a right-handed Œ≤-helix. Most of the currently characterized alginate lyases belong to the Œ≤-jelly roll class, in which a curved anti-parallel inner and an outer Œ≤-sheet are bonded together. The inner sheet of the Œ≤-jelly roll contains the active site. Lyases with these folds tend to belong to the PL-7, PL-14, and PL-18 families. The (Œ±/Œ±)n toroid class contains a barrel-shaped catalytic domain which is composed of between three and seven counterclockwise helical hairpins. These hairpins are formed by various anti-parallel Œ±-helices. Four of the currently characterized alginate lyase structures belong to this class. The enzymes in this class typically belong to the PL-5, PL-15, and PL-17 families. There is only one known alginate lyase in the Œ≤-helix class: AlyGC. This enzyme is exolytic and G block specific, and it is a representative alginate lyase from the PL-6 family. The N and C terminus of AlyGC form right-handed Œ≤-helix folds, which is uncommon among polysaccharide lyases. Three Œ≤-sheets comprise each fold. These sheets are designated PB1-PB3, and the twists in between each sheet are named T1-T3, with T1 coming after PB1, T2 coming after PB2, and so on. The active site is located on the N-terminus, where it is encircled by a C-terminal loop, as well as N-terminal loops and N-terminal Œ≤-strands. The cleft at the center of the active site is blocked on one end and open on the other, giving AlyGC its exolytic properties. There is a Ca2+ at the center of the active site, which aids in the Œ≤-elimination mechanism by neutralizing the alginate's carboxylic group at the +1 subsite of the residue.  Applications  = Cystic Fibrosis = Alginate is a major component in the biofilms formed during mucoid P. aeruginosa infections. Alginate lyase is able to disrupt P. aeruginosa biofilm formation by degrading the alginate in the biofilm matrix, dislodging the bacteria from surfaces and allowing for more effective antibiotic use.

Despite the merger, the company initially maintained two divisions: Reading, covering the former TV area, and Aldershot, covering A&D;'s area, each of which continued to issue its own timetable booklet. From 1 November 1973 these divisions were renamed North and South. Thames Valley had also managed the South Midland express services between Oxford and London, but these were transferred to City of Oxford Motor Services in 1971. The new company's head office was at the former TV headquarters in Reading, but the Aldershot office was retained as a divisional headquarters,\\"Aldershot's Buses\\" by Peter Holmes\\"National Bus Company: The Early Years\\" by Kevin Lane\\"National Bus Company: The Road to Privatisation\\" by Kevin Lane and in 1981 became the head office, allowing the Reading site to be sold for redevelopment. =Liveries= The buses began to be painted in dark red and cream, with small Tilling-style Alder Valley fleetnames with gold coloured lettering in early 1972. In keeping with the NBC policy, however, poppy red was soon applied (from December 1972), with a white stripe at waist level (single-deckers) or above the lower windows (double-deckers), along with white double-N logo, bold white fleetnames and light grey wheels. The logo later appeared in red and blue on a round-cornered white rectangular background. In the early days of the NBC livery, cream coloured NBC-style fleetnames/logos were applied to those vehicles which retained A&D; two-tone green/cream or the early red/cream liveries. Alder Valley coaches were painted white all over with the red and blue \\"NATIONAL\\" fleetname and logo, with the Alder Valley fleetname less-prominently. \\"Dual-purpose\\" vehicles (i.e. bus- bodied vehicles fitted with coach seats and used mainly on long-distance stage-carriage services but also on express services, private hire, excursions and local stage-carriage services) were painted poppy red below waist level and white above, with red fleetnames and logos. A variation was a white livery with broad red band at waist level.photo by L Smith in Aldershot's Buses In 1977 (and for some time afterwards) a Dennis Loline carried a silver and red livery in honour of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Later, coaches carried a livery of white with an angular application of black and red horizontal stripes; this was also applied to the company's open-top double-decker based at Aldershot depot (see illustration). Coaches used on the London express services carried Londonlink branding from this point. There were, however, a large number of variations from the above standards.\\"Aldershot's Buses\\" by Peter Holmes and Recollections of M P Andrew =Fleet= While A&D; was a British Electric Traction company with a varied fleet including mostly Dennis Lolines and AEC Reliances, Thames Valley had a typical Tilling Group fleet comprising almost entirely Bristol vehicles. Some cross-border swapping of vehicles occurred between the two divisions after the merger. Through NBC days, Alder Valley adopted the Leyland National and Bristol VRT as its standard single and double deck buses. In the early/mid-1970s there was a severe shortage of vehicles, resulting in the hiring-in of a varied fleet which included a Trans World Airlines double decker noted on services from Aldershot, including the service 12 to Reading in 1974; a number of elderly City of Oxford AEC Reliances in maroon and green livery, which operated Aldershot local services; and at least two ageing Sheffield United Tours coaches which operated daily on the Farnham to London service. Vehicle shortages (together with poor staff morale and retention) led to poor customer service at this time, with many service cancellations. =Depots= Depots were maintained in Newbury, Reading, Lambourn, High Wycombe, Maidenhead, Bracknell, Aldershot, Guildford, Woking, Hindhead and Alton, which eventually became an outstation when Alton depot was closed. =Operation= As well as local services, Alder Valley also ran frequent express coach services from Farnham and Reading into London, and seasonal services to the south coast. With changes in legislation in the early 1980s, the London services were mostly switched to the M3 and M4 motorways and re-branded as Londonlink. These services enjoyed a healthy boom period for a decade or so, with greatly expanded commuter services. =Decline= At the same time, local services were in decline and the Market Analysis Project (MAP) resulted in severe reductions in mileage, the end of any remaining two-person bus operation, and a reduction in the fleet size. Local fleetnames were applied to buses and publicity, and the Blackwater Valley MAP scheme saw the revival of the Aldershot & District name, while other areas were less fortunate (Forestride, Weyfarer, etc.). These names vanished after a couple of years.

The album is a collection of comedy sketches written and performed by Castellaneta and Lacusta, and was the follow-up to Castellaneta's previous all-music album Two Lips. The title of the album is a reference to Leonard Nimoy's first autobiography, I Am Not Spock, and a majority of the sketches were material that the pair had used before in their careers. Production A majority of the sketches had been written and performed before the CD was recorded, and Castellaneta thought that it would be a good idea to preserve them \\"since [he and Lacusta] don't perform them much anymore.\\" Some came from their sketch series on a local radio station in Chicago and had to be lengthened from the \\"two-minute bits\\" that they were originally, while several others were stage sketches performed in a comedy club in Santa Monica. Additionally, \\"Citizen Kane\\", a sketch in which two people discuss the film Citizen Kane with different meanings, was something the pair had performed at an art gallery. Castellaneta noted that \\"we already knew that these skits were funny, [but] some of them we polished and tightened.\\" The skits were principally written by improvising from a basic point, transcribing the results and then editing them to the finished scene. Castellaneta chose the title I Am Not Homer as a parody of Leonard Nimoy's famous first autobiography I Am Not Spock, as well as to show that most of the comedy featured \\"is not the typical Homer comedy.\\" It was also a reference to the fact that many people do not know anything about Castellaneta's comedy career away from The Simpsons. Reception A Canadian writer, Jenny Yuen, gave the CD a mixed review, noting \\"some funny moments\\", but \\"the sketches barely match annoying bickering one could listen to on an episode of All in the Family\\". She did, however, praise the final track, \\"So Dumb\\", which features Castellaneta singing a song as his main characters from The Simpsons: Homer, Krusty the Clown, Abraham Simpson, Barney Gumble and Groundskeeper Willie. Bradley Torreano found that there are \\"a few very funny sketches, but in the long run this is a very average comedy album that only inspires the occasional chuckle\\".

Established in 1952, the National Library, along with Yangon University Library, is one of only two research libraries in Yangon. The library houses more than 220,000 books, divided into 10 sections. Its collection used to be about 618,000 books and periodicals as well as 15,800 rare and valuable manuscripts. However, in 2006, the military government announced a plan to move a large part of its collection to a new National Library in Nay Pyi Taw, and to auction off its 8-story building and lot in Tamwe Township. In October 2008, the National Library was moved to its current location. The library's current collection of ancient Burmese texts includes 16,066 palm-leaf inscriptions, 1972 parabaik (folded writing tablets made of paper, cloth or metal), and 345 handwritten scripts of famous writers. The library's preservation and conservation section, established in 1993, regularly maintains rare Burmese manuscripts. The library plans to offer an online catalogue. The National Library is a member of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and National Libraries Group-Southeast Asia. History The National Library originated from the Bernard Free Library, which opened in 1883 during the British colonial era. The Bernard Library was renamed the State Library under the management of the Ministry of Culture in 1952, and changed its name to the National Library in 1967. The library was first located in the Jubilee Hall building, then moved to Pansodan Road, then relocated to its penultimate home in Tamwe, and finally moved to its present location in Yankin in October 2008.

It is intended to show acceptance of traditional gender roles, modesty, readiness to work and serve, and to preserve communal identity and separation from the immodest, ever-changing fashions of the world.  Practicing groups  The practice is generally found among the following Anabaptist branches: Amish (Old Order Amish, New Order Amish, Kauffman Amish Mennonites, Beachy Amish Mennonites), Para-Amish (Believers in Christ, Vernon Community, Caneyville Christian Community), Mennonites (Old Order Mennonites, Conservative Mennonites, traditional \\"Russian\\" Mennonites), Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, and Brethren (Old Order River Brethren, Old Brethren, Old German Baptist Brethren- New Conference, Dunkard Brethren). Plain dress is also practiced by Conservative Friends and Holiness Friends (Quakers), in which it is part of their testimony of simplicity, as well as Cooperites (Gloriavale Christian Community) and fundamentalist Mormon subgroups. Among the Amish and other plain groups, plain dress is not considered to be a costume but instead is an expression of their religious philosophy. Plain, simple and serviceable gender-identifying dress is governed by an unwritten code of conduct, called \\"ordnung\\" among Anabaptists, which is strictly adhered to by Amish, Old Order Mennonites, and conservative Brethren. Many Apostolic Lutherans also wear plain dress. Historically, Methodists were known for wearing plain dress, a tradition carried on by a few members in the conservative holiness movement, such as communicants of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, as well as some Pentecostal denominations in the Wesleyan-Arminian tradition. Members of the Moravian Church traditionally wore plain dress. Traditional Adventists wear plain dress as taught by the founder of that faith Ellen White, who asked that they \\"adopt a simple, unadorned dress of modest length\\". Adherents of the Seventh-day Adventist Church have historically not worn wedding rings. Other groups adhering to a conservative dress code include Buddhist and Christian monks, Orthodox Jews, and Muslim women, but these forms of dress normally are not called \\"plain dress\\".  Practices  Plain dress is attributed to reasons of theology and sociology. In general, plain dress involves the covering of much of the body (often including the head, forearms and calves), with minimal ornamentation, rejecting print fabrics, trims, fasteners, and jewelry. Non- essential elements of garments such as neckties, collars, and lapels may be minimized or omitted. Practical garments such as aprons and shawls may be layered over the basic ensemble. Plain dress garments are often handmade and may be produced by groups of women in the community for efficiency and to ensure uniformity of style. Plain dress practices can extend to the grooming of hair and beards and may vary somewhat to allow children and older people more latitude.Reynolds, Margaret C.; Bronner, Simon J. (2001). Plain Women: Gender and Ritual in the Old Order River Brethren Penn State Press. pp. 61‚Äì96. Within these general practices, distinctions abound. In some groups, for example, the women's preferred head covering is lacy or translucent; in others, it must be opaque. = Anabaptist = The traditional plain dress worn by the Anabaptists and other religious groups has long sleeves with a set waist, long skirt, and no adornment. It denotes \\"utility, modesty, long wear and inconspicuousness\\", does not display any trademark, and is not dictated by fashion trends. Shawl, aprons, bonnets and cap are part of plain dress. Clothing worn by Bruderhof women includes a headcovering, as well as long skirts or dresses; men wear contemporary clothes of a modest nature. = Quaker = As a part of their testimony of simplicity, Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) traditionally wore plain dress; \\"Ruffles and lace and other forms of ornamentation, as well as unnecessary cuffs and collars and lapels and buttons, were forbidden.\\" George Fox implored fellow Quakers to wear plain dress: This classical Quaker belief practice continues to be maintained by Conservative Friends, as well as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends. = Methodist = Wesleyan Methodist girls enter the tabernacle at a camp meeting. Early Methodists wore plain dress, with Methodist clergy condemning \\"high headdresses, ruffles, laces, gold, and 'costly apparel' in general\\". John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist movement, recommended that Methodists read his thoughts On Dress, in which he detailed acceptable types and colors of fabrics, in addition to \\"shapes and sizes of hats, coats, sleeves, and hairstyles\\";Journals of Wesley, Nehemiah Curnock, ed.,London: Epworth Press 1938, p. 468. in that sermon, John Wesley expressed his desire for Methodists: \\"Let me see, before I die, a Methodist congregation, full as plain dressed as a Quaker congregation.\\" He also taught, with respect to Christian headcovering, that women, \\"especially in a religious assembly\\", should \\"keep on her veil\\". Those who tried to attend Methodist services in costly apparel were denied admittance.Rupert Davies, A History of the Methodist Church in Great Britain, London : Epworth, 1965, p.197. Wesley's teaching was based on his interpretation of and , which he stated led him to conclude that \\"expensive clothes puff up their wearers, promote vanity, incite anger, inflame lust, retard the pursuit of holiness, and steal from God and the poor.\\" The 1858 Discipline of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection stated that \\"we would not only ejoin on all who fear God plain dress, but we would recommend to our preachers and people, according to Mr. Wesley's views expressed in his sermon on the inefficiency of Christianity, published but a few years before his death, and containing his matured judgment, distinguishing plainness‚ÄîPlainness which will publicly comment them to the maintenance of their Christian profession wherever they may be.\\" The 1859 novel Adam Bede portrayed the Methodist itinerant preacher, Dinah Morris, wearing plain dress, with the words \\"I saw she was a Methodist, or Quaker, or something of that sort, by her dress\\". Peter Cartwright, a Methodist revivalist, lamented the decline of wearing plain dress among Methodists, stating: While few wear plain dress in mainline Methodism today, some Methodist Churches of the conservative holiness movement, such as the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection and Evangelical Wesleyan Church, continue to dress plainly, also avoiding the wearing of jewelry (inclusive of wedding rings). = Moravian = Historically, members of the Moravian Church wore plain dress:  Theological bases  Plain dressing Christians cite Paul's advice to the Romans, \\"Be not conformed to this world,\\" as one Biblical basis for their distinctive dress. Other scripture passages counsel women to wear head coverings while praying (), not to cut their hair (), and for men not to shave or cut their beards ().Torrey, Mary Ide (1838). Ornament, or the Christian Rule of Dress Crocker & Brewster. The rejection of extravagant clothing is further established in  Social effects  Plain dress may establish a sense of belonging within the community while also marking the group's members as different in the wider society. Some practitioners describe their dress as a protection from unwanted attention. Quaker minister Elizabeth Fry considered her plain dress to serve as \\"a hedge against the world\\", and \\"a sort of protector\\".Caton, Mary Anne (2003). \\"The Aesthetics of Absence: Quaker Women's Plain Dress in the Delaware Valley, 1790‚Äì1900\\" in Emma Jones Lapsansky and Anne A. Verplanck, eds., Quaker Aesthetics: Reflections on a Quaker Ethic in American Design and Consumption, 1720‚Äì1920. University of Pennsylvania Press. pp. 246‚Äì271. Marketing through the internet has these sites which propagate plain dress: \\"Quaker Jane\\", \\"Plain and Simple Headcoverings\\", \\"Rachel‚Äôs Seamstress Services\\" and \\"Mennonite Maidens\\". Simple dress, considered \\"sensible and useful\\" and necessary, is sometimes hard to find as the clothing market is dictated by fashion conscious people who consider plain dress dull.  In literature  Dressing heroines in Victorian literature in plain dress is often assumed to be a way of making characters appear classless and sexless. Others argue that authors like Charlotte Bront√´, George Eliot, and Anthony Trollope use plain dress to highlight the marriageability of the character, sexualizing her by emphasizing the female body within. Additionally, plain dress may signify a character's rejection of societal norms and willingness to leave the household to act on her desires.

Reed (1927‚Äì1990), was a Reader's Digest roving editor. Career He was born in Chicago, Illinois. He graduated from the University of Chicago at age 18 and began his journalism career with the Chicago City News Service. He later joined the Chicago Daily News. Reed was a roving editor with Reader's Digest who reported from more than 100 countries and covered more than a dozen wars, including wars in Vietnam, Angola, Nicaragua, Cambodia, and many conflicts elsewhere in the world. Reed learned Swahili during a two-year fellowship from the Institute of Current World Affairs to Kenya during the Mau Mau insurgency in the 1950s. In the late 1950s, he was a reporter for the U.S. News and World Report. He joined the Reader's Digest in the early 1960s and worked there for the remainder of his lifetime. He interviewed several United States presidents, including then president Richard Nixon at the White House in 1971: . He was the author of 111 Days in Stanleyville, Harper & Row, NY, 1965 and Up Front in Vietnam, Funk & Wagnalls, NY, 1967. 111 Days in Stanleyville was reprinted as Save The Hostages, Bantam Books, NY, 1988. Reed wrote 111 Days in Stanleyville after spending more than four years in Africa during seven trips there on writing assignments. He took a two-month overland trip across the continent, and climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. In 1960 he covered the independence push in Congo as a staff writer for the U.S. News and World Report magazine. Reed wrote Up Front in Vietnam after spending months in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. He travelled across Vietnam, criss-crossing back and forth in C-130 cargo planes, helicopters, trucks and jeeps. In the book, Reed wrote a series of sketches about what it was like to be up front with the soldiers in the combat zone in Vietnam. In 1988, Reed received the Republic of China's International Communications Service award. Reed was inducted into the Chicago Journalism Hall of Fame posthumously in 1992.

His father was a successful Chicago real estate broker. His grandfather, Thomas A. Reed, had migrated to Chicago from central Pennsylvania and worked at the 1893 World‚Äôs Columbian Exposition, also known as the \\"Chicago World‚Äôs Fair.\\" He started a successful plastering and construction company at the Chicago World's Fair, now known as the Reed Illinois Corporation, which still exists in Chicago to the present day. One of Reed‚Äôs 2nd great grandfathers: James Pettit (1777‚Äì1849), and his son Eber M. Pettit (1802‚Äì1885), operated a station on the Underground Railroad in New York state to assist escaping slaves from the South. Eber M. Pettit wrote \\"Sketches in the History of the Underground Railroad,\\" in 1879, which was reprinted in 1999. Jonathan Pettit (1752‚Äì1833), Reed's 3rd great-grandfather, served as a captain in the American Revolution in New York state. Reed was also related to the Adams presidential family. David Reed was married to Marilyn \\"Mari\\" Chevalier, then of New York City, from 1961‚Äì1977, and had three children. He was married to Audrey Hamilton of Johannesburg, South Africa in the late 1970s. He married Irene Whitaker, then of Maryland, in 1988. David Reed was an avid sailor. At different times while travelling the globe, he was based in New York, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, and Virginia.

It shared the same carriage with the 155mm Howitzer M1 and fired the same ammunition as the British BL 4.5 inch Medium Field Gun. The weapon was used by the US Army in Northwest Europe late in the war for corps support; with the end of hostilities it was declared obsolete. Development and production In 1920 the US Army Ordnance started to work on a new medium field gun. Since the US Army had already employed the 4.7 inch gun M1906 during World War I, this caliber was also selected for the new weapon. The development resulted in 4.7 inch gun M1922E on Carriage M1921E. Due to lack of funding, the design never reached production.Hogg ‚Äì Allied Artillery of World War II, p 50-51.Zaloga ‚Äì US Field Artillery of World War II, p 18-19. In 1939 the program was restarted; the renewed design, designated 4.7 inch gun T3, was ready by early 1940; it utilized the same carriage as the concurrently developed 155 mm howitzer. At this stage, the army decided to change the weapon to use the British 4.5 inch ammunition. The modified gun was standardized in April 1941 as 4.5 inch gun M1 on carriage M1. The production started in September 1942 and continued until February 1944. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:55%; background:#fff; border-collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line- height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\\"  colspan=\\"12\\" Production of M1Zaloga ‚Äì US Field Artillery of World War II, p 9.

The only significant difference was its tube of 4.5 inch (114 mm) caliber. The tube had uniform right hand twist, with one turn in 32 calibers.Hunnicutt ‚Äì Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank, p 506. The unbalanced weight of the barrel was supported by two equilibrator springs. The breach was of interrupted screw type; the recoil system hydro-pneumatic, variable length. The carriage was of split trail type, unsprung and had wheels with pneumatic tires. In firing position, the weapon was supported by a retractable pedestal. The gun was equipped with M12 panoramic sight.Technical Manual TM 9-2005 volume 3, Infantry and Cavalry Accompanying Weapons, p 59-62. Service 155 mm Howitzer M1 (left) and 4.5 inch Gun M1 (right) at the U.S. Army Field Artillery Museum, Ft. Sill, OK. Note the similarity between the two pieces. The M1 equipped 17Anderson ‚Äì US Army in World War II. field artillery battalions in Northwest Europe, where it was employed for corps support. M5 High Speed Tractor was assigned as prime mover. The weapon was declared obsolete in September 1945. US Army field artillery battalions armed with the 4.5-inch gun included at least: 172nd, 176th, 199th, 211th, 259th, 770th through 775th, 777th, 935th, 939th, 941st, and 959th. The gun had good range, nearly five km longer than its 155 mm howitzer sibling and longer than the 155 mm Gun M1918MI. It was out-ranged by another 155 mm gun, the 155 mm Gun M1, but the latter was nearly three times heavier. On the other side, the 4.5 inch gun was criticized for insufficient power of its high-explosive shell. The shell was produced from low grade (\\"19 ton\\") steel, which necessitated thick walls. As a result, it carried only about two kg of TNT or substitute, in fact less than the 105 mm high-explosive shell. Additionally, it was felt that having a small number of guns of atypical caliber unnecessarily complicated logistics.

A single prototype was built.Hunnicutt ‚Äì Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank, p 337-338. Ammunition The M1 utilized separate loading, bagged charge ammunition. Only high explosive projectile was available.Technical Manual TM 9-1904, Ammunition Inspection Guide, p 486-490. The projectile could be fired with propelling charge M7 (normal) at reduced velocity or with propelling charge M8 (super) to achieve full velocity.

In 1991, it replaced the Diving Equipment Manufacturers Association (DEMA) (renamed as the Diving Equipment and Marketing Association in 1998) as the secretariat for the then American National Standards Institute (ANSI) committee for Underwater Safety (also known as the Z86 Committee). The Z86 committee was subsequently replaced by the committee for Diving Instructional Standards and Safety (also known as the Z375 committee). In 2007 it retained its appointment as the ANSI Accredited Standards Developer (ASD) for the Z375 committee. The US RSTC has been responsible for the development of a standard medical statement (in conjunction with the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) and minimum training standards for diving hand signals and the following recreational diver grades - Introductory Scuba Experience, Supervised Diver, Open Water Diver, Enriched Air Nitrox Certification, Entry level Rescue Diver, Dive Supervisor, Assistant Instructor, Scuba Instructor and Scuba Instructor Trainer. In 2020 the revised 'RSTC Medical Declaration Form' and 'Notes for Physicians' (diving medical guidance) were published, following a three-year review by the 'Diver Medical Screen Committee'. (DMSC) comprises a team of internationally respected diving medicine experts; Dr Nick Bird, Dr Oliver Firth, (the late) Professor Tony Frew, Dr Alessandro Marroni, Professor Simon Mitchell, Associate Professor Neal Pollock and Dr Adel Taher. Membership of a US RSTC council member is one of the recognition criteria used by Boy Scouts of America (BSA) for the selection of recreational scuba diving instructors for the training of its members in order to receive the BSA Scuba Diving merit badge.

His case later became a well publicised example of the perceived injustices of British military discipline during the war, and he was pardoned in 2006. Biography Born in South Moor, Durham, Goggins was a miner who joined the 19th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry as a volunteer, although his occupation exempted him from conscription. On 26 November 1916, Goggins was guarding a position near Arras on the Western Front with Corporal John McDonald. Sergeant Joseph Stones, fleeing a German ambush, ran past their position shouting \\"Run for your lives, the Huns are on top of you!\\", and Goggins and McDonald retreated to a reserve trench away. Both men were subsequently charged with deserting their posts, and in spite of Stones' evidence that he had given the order to retreat, they were convicted at court martial on Christmas Eve and sentenced to death. Stones was sentenced to death at a separate court martial several days later for casting away his rifle in the same incident. The sentences were supported by Brigadier-General H O'Donnell, who wrote that he had doubts about the quality of the evidence, but felt that the executions were necessary to set an example to other men in the battalion.O'Donnell's letter is reproduced at http://www.janpieterchielens.be/shotatdawn/page28.html by the Shot at Dawn Campaign group. All three men were executed on 18 January. The chaplain who prayed with them before their deaths remarked that he had never met three braver men. Goggins' execution had a devastating effect on his family. His wife of six months disappeared soon afterwards, and his mother had a nervous breakdown. He was seldom mentioned by his family, who saw his conviction as a source of shame, and his niece, Marina Brewis, who had simply been told that he died in the war, only learned his true fate years later from a television documentary. On learning the truth she began a campaign for her uncle to be pardoned. Peter Goggins' case became a well publicised example of the injustices of the First World War due to the efforts of Marina Brewis, the fact that he had apparently been following orders, and the fact that the triple execution was unique. In 2006, Goggins was finally pardoned along with the other 305 British and British Empire soldiers executed for cowardice during the First World War, under the terms of the Armed Forces Act 2006. His case had been one of those discussed in Parliament during the passage of the Act.

It is now made at Premier Foods plant at Histon, north of Cambridge. It sells around 4 million jars a year. The plant is next to the Cambridgeshire Guided Busway (former Cambridge & St. Ives Branch). = Marketing = In 1964, when owned by Joseph Farrow, it promoted the idea of stirring some of its honey into hot milk for a nightcap, or to help a sore throat by putting honey into hot water with some lemon juice. In the 1960s the account was handled by JWT. A jingle used to advertise the honey was: Gale's, Gale's pass the honey please, think about the honey, think about the bees.

He received his undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon and his Ph.D. from the University of Washington. Career In 1999, Savage's research team published TCP Congestion Control with a Misbehaving Receiver, which uncovered protocol flaws in the TCP protocol that carries most Internet traffic. By exploiting these flaws, Savage proposed means for attackers to evade congestion control, allowing attackers to monopolize crowded network connections that would otherwise be shared by multiple users. This was the first paper to address congestion control evasion as a vulnerability, rather than as a theoretical design implication. That same year, Savage published \\"Sting\\", a paper and software tool that presented a mechanism to abuse quirks in the TCP protocol to allow a single party to infer bidirectional packet loss, a valuable contribution to traffic measurement.http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/savage99tcp.html>Sting: a TCP-based Network Measurement Tool - Savage (ResearchIndex) In 2000, Savage's team published Practical Network Support for IP Traceback, which proposed a simple stochastic extension to internet routers that would enable them to trace floods of traffic back to their origin. IP traceback is a major open networking research question, with significant implications towards DDOS mitigation: if IP traffic can be traced, Internet Service Providers can track down and halt DDOS floods. Savage later co-founded Asta Networks, which offered a product that addressed these problems.Practical Network Support for IP Traceback - Savage, Wetherall, Karlin, Anderson (ResearchIndex) In 2001, Savage, with colleagues at UCSD and CAIDA, published Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity, which introduced the idea of the network telescope and provided major empirical results regarding DDOS attacks.Inferring Internet Denial-of-Service Activity - Moore, Voelker, Savage (ResearchIndex) Follow-on work has provided insight into the spread of network worms, including Code Red II and SQL Slammer.Inside the slammer worm - Security & Privacy Magazine, IEEE In 2003, John Bellardo and Savage published 802.11 Denial-of-Service Attacks: Real Vulnerabilities and Practical Solutions, which introduced practical attacks on 802.11 wireless protocol flaws that would allow attackers to force legitimate clients off wireless networks. The paper is also a notable example of applied reverse engineering in an academic setting; Bellardo and Savage reverse engineered the Intersil wireless chipset, finding an undocumented diagnostic mode that allowed them to directly inject malicious wireless packets onto a network.http://www.cs.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/UsenixSec03.pdf In 2004, Savage and George Varghese led a research team that published Automated Worm Fingerprinting, which introduced a novel hashing technique that allowed network operators to monitor network traffic and uncover data patterns that were \\"propagating\\", spreading across the network at an unusual rate. Propagating traffic is a strong indicator for network worm outbreaks, a key unsolved problem in network security. Varghese later co-founded Netsift to capitalize on this research; Cisco purchased Netsift in 2005.Automated Worm Fingerprinting - Singh (ResearchIndex) In 2005, Ishwar Ramani and Stefan Savage developed Syncscan algorithm that cuts the time needed to switch between Wi-Fi access points. In 2010 he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. In 2013, Savage received the ACM SIGOPS Mark Weiser Award. In 2015, he received the ACM Prize in Computing for \\"innovative research in network security, privacy, and reliability that has taught us to view attacks and attackers as elements of an integrated technological, societal, and economic system.\\" In 2017, he was named a MacArthur Foundation Fellow (the \\"genius grant\\") for his body of work.

He took part in the trial of Richard, Earl of Cambridge, and Lord Scrope for their part in the Southampton Plot, and was one of the commanders at Agincourt in 1415. Career Richard de Vere, born 15 August 1385, was the eldest son of Aubrey de Vere, 10th Earl of Oxford, and his wife Alice Fitzwalter, daughter of John, 3rd Baron Fitzwalter, by Eleanor Percy, daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy.; ; . The 10th Earl died on 23 April 1400 while Richard was underage. His wardship was initially granted to his mother, but after her death on 29 April 1401, King Henry IV granted it to his mother-in-law, Joan de Bohun, Countess of Hereford.. Oxford had livery of his lands on 21 December 1406 without proof of age.. From 1410 onwards Oxford was appointed as a commissioner in Essex on various occasions, and in November 1411 was a Trier of Petitions from overseas in Parliament. In August 1412 Oxford was among those who sailed to Normandy under Thomas of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Clarence, to aid the Armagnac party against the Burgundians. According to Pugh, the members of the nobility who accompanied the Duke of Clarence on this expedition did so in hope of financial gain, Oxford's earldom in particular having suffered from forfeitures and attainders during the lives of his predecessors which had made him 'the poorest member of the English higher nobility'.. Another member of the Duke of Clarence's expedition was Richard, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, and three years later, on 5 August 1415, Oxford was among the peers at the trial, presided over by the Duke of Clarence, which condemned to death Cambridge and Lord Scrope for their part in the Southampton Plot on the eve of Henry V's invasion of France.. A few days later Oxford sailed to France with the King, and was one of the commanders at Agincourt on 25 October 1415.. In May 1416 Oxford was invested with the Order of the Garter, and in that year sailed with the fleet to relieve Harfleur, taking part in the naval battle at the mouth of the Seine on 15 August.; . Oxford died 15 February 1417, aged 31, and was buried at Earls Colne, Essex. His widow, Alice, married Sir Nicholas Thorley, of London, Bobbingworth, Essex, and Sawtres (in Thundridge), Hertfordshire, Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire, 1431‚Äì2. He served in the contingent of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. He and his wife, Countess Alice, presented to the churches of Badlesmere, Kent, 1421, Aston Sandford, Buckinghamshire, 1422, and St Erme, Cornwall, 1432. In October 1421 he was brought before a court consisting of the Regent, Beaufort, the Chancellor, Treasurer, Privy Seal, Justices of either Bench, and others of the Council, and acknowledged that he had married the widowed Countess of Oxford without the king‚Äôs permission. The Chancellor took into the king‚Äôs hands all of the lands of the Countess until he made a fine for their recovery, and sent him to the Tower in irons, where he remained until February 1424, when the Countess had paid a full year‚Äôs value of her lands. Alice obtained a papal indult for plenary remission in 1426. In November 1426 he and his wife, Alice, were fully pardoned for having married without royal licence. In 1436 he and John Robessart, Knt. owed 110 marks to Lawrence Downe, Gent. In 1440 he and his wife, Alice, Countess of Oxford, John Passheley, and John Marny, Esq., sued John Balle, of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, yeoman, in the Court of Common Pleas regarding a debt. Sir Nicholas Thorley died 5 May 1442. His widow, Alice, Countess of Oxford, died 18 May 1452, and was buried at Earls Colne, Essex..

Bath Fringe was founded in 1981 as a counterbalance to the 'classical'-dominated Bath Music Festival, which some people perceived to be elitist and out-of-touch with what a younger local audience wanted. In many ways the Bath Fringe was a direct descendant of the Walcot Festivals of the 1970s and 1980s, which had included elements of theatre, pop festival, ‚Äòhappening‚Äô, eco-activism and local creativity, supported by Bath Arts Workshop. The festival is among the oldest continually operating in England, and includes around 200 events, taking place around the late May Bank Holiday, running for 17 days at the end of May and beginning of June. Organisation After the initial 1981 fringe festival, it became smaller until by 1991-2 it hosted fewer than a dozen events. A new group, a cooperative of local artists, promoters, venue managers and audience members revitalised the festival during the 1990s. Bath Fringe tends to try to create other organisations to run specific events or strands, so has variously given birth to: * FAB (Fringe Arts Bath) - the visual arts part of the festival * Walcot Independence Day ‚Äî a large and popular outdoor party with much local creativity. Discontinued * Streats ‚Äî street, outdoor, site-specific, installations, performances in unusual spaces, who run the annual Bedlam Fair street festival, financed through the Fringe.

In common with many Fringe Festivals all round the world most of the programme consists of people presenting their own events in their own venue or one hired for the duration ‚Äì Bath Fringe does however run a core programme of street/outdoor/tented events itself and it maintains an Open Access policy, not imposing artistic constraints on work that participants put on themselves. The major tasks of the organisation revolve around the production of a print programme and website, and facilitating others to put on or include events. The relative financial independence of any individual sponsor or venue is maintained although funding was received from the local Bath and North East Somerset council and Arts Council England.

Many of the people working at the festival (technicians, facilities) also work at the big events, and there is some crossover of performers too. Bath Fringe sits in the ‚ÄòFestival Scene‚Äô tradition as much as in the development of Fringe Theatre, although the Walcot Festival emphasis on outdoor performance and ‚Äòguerilla‚Äô events put it as a pioneer in the development of what are currently called ‚ÄòStreet Arts‚Äô.

After early conducting engagements in Strasbourg he made his debut at Ulm in 1908 or 1909. He held appointments in Barmen (1909), at the Vienna Volksoper (1911), and at Nuremberg (1913), where he also conducted Philharmonic concerts. He went on to Munich and Vienna, where he recorded a magnificent version of Goldmark's Rustic Wedding Symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic; and then to Berlin (1933-1950), where a live wartime Lohengrin was preserved and afterwards issued on LP, after which he returned again to Munich. In 1932 he conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and one-armed pianist Paul Wittgenstein in the world premiere of Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, after Arturo Toscanini had declined Ravel's invitation to conduct the premiere. In 1937, Heger joined the Nazi Party. Heger conducted at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, from 1925 to 1935, and again with his Munich company in 1953, when he gave the first London performance of Richard Strauss's opera Capriccio.

It was developed in the early 1980s to address concerns relating to the accurately measuring fine grained gold, and dealing with problems associated with sample heterogeneity.  Analysis  A large quantity of sample (between 2 and 5 kg) is digested or leached with cold sodium cyanide (NaCN) solution (generally 0.1% NaCN), for one to several days (depending on the assay laboratory involved). The gold is dissolved through its formation of a cyanide complex, which is concentrated through the solvent exchange process into an organic solvent and subsequently analyzed. The use of large sample weights and solvent extraction enables low detection limits, as low as 0.1 ppb. The digest is analyzed for Au (0.01 ppb), Cu (0.01 ppm), Ag (0.5 ppb), and depending on situations, for other elements. However, gold values in BLEG are lower than total assays such as those of fire assays, as it analyzes only the fine grained gold fraction and largely ignores coarser and nuggety gold. If the need arises, a separate split of the original sample is used for pathfinder elements.  Sampling Considerations  BLEG requires the collection of large samples, generally greater than 2 kg. It is necessary to collect fine sized material ‚Äì silt to clay - where the fine flakes of gold will reside. Given their shape, these fine flakes of gold don‚Äôt act hydro-dynamically like heavy minerals, and will not settle in the same locations in a stream bed. Where possible, attempts should be made to sample flash flood sites (where finer material concentrates) ‚Äì overbank deposits. = BLEG vs Sieving = BLEG is essentially a chemical sieve, designed to focus on the fine grained gold fraction. While many exploration geologists attest to the value of BLEG, some question its value compared to analyzing a simple sieved-out fine grained fraction. BLEG has been tried and tested over 20 years, applied successfully in different climatic settings, provides robust, excellent repeatability of results and has had an important role in discovery of massive Au deposits. However, some comparisons show that fine-grained sieved samples (<75 Œºm) show comparable results to BLEG, making the more complex process potentially unnecessary. With the exception of BLEGs applicability over a wider range of climatic conditions, the superiority of one method over the other is, at this point, still largely determined by personal preference.

He is best known for his work with David Hood, Jimmy Johnson, and Roger Hawkins, his bandmates in the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which performed with numerous notable artists on their studio albums and helped define the \\"Muscle Shoals sound\\". Among the artists Beckett recorded with were Bob Dylan, Boz Scaggs, Paul Simon, Rod Stewart, Duane Allman, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Dire Straits, The Proclaimers and Phish. He was also briefly a member of the band Traffic. Biography Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Beckett rose to prominence as a member of the rhythm section at the Muscle Shoals studio in Sheffield, Alabama, of which he was one of the founders in 1969. As a founding member of the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section (also known as the Swampers), he helped define what became known as the Muscle Shoals sound. In addition, the studio produced such chart-making hits as \\"Torn Between Two Lovers\\" by Mary MacGregor and the Sanford-Townsend Band's \\"Smoke from a Distant Fire\\". In 1973 Beckett took to the road in the expanded lineup of Traffic; recordings from this tour were released on the band's live album On the Road. Beckett was co-producing with Jerry Wexler when, in 1979, Bob Dylan called on Wexler to produce the sessions for the album Slow Train Coming. Beckett not only co-produced the album but played piano and organ throughout. (He did not go on the road as a gospel tours musician behind Dylan, but he was back in the studio with him in February 1980 to co-produce, again with Wexler, the album Saved, on which he was replaced on keyboards by Spooner Oldham and Terry Young after the session of February 12, 1980, and so plays only on the album‚Äôs title track, \\"Solid Rock\\", \\"What Can I Do for You?\\" and \\"Satisfied Mind\\". On the album liner notes Beckett is billed as co-producer and as \\"special guest artist\\". Beckett moved to Nashville in 1982 to become A & R country music director for Warner Bros. Records and co-produced Williams, Jr.'s records with Jim Ed Norman. Beckett produced records independently after leaving Warner Bros. Records. He also played on Paul Simon's albums There Goes Rhymin' Simon and Still Crazy After All These Years, which reached number 1 on the 'Billboard 200 pop chart.'' Beckett died from complications of a stroke at his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee, aged 66.

She received many significant public commissions. Her work is held in public and private collections. Her best known work is Forward Surge (1974) at the Melbourne Arts Centre. She became a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 1984.  Early years: Berlin to Melbourne  = Berlin = Inge King (n√©e Ingeborg Viktoria Neufeld) was born in Berlin on 26 November 1915, the youngest of four girls in a well-to-do Jewish family.Her year of birth is incorrectly given in many published sources as 1918. As a result, erroneous dates have been assigned by inference to a number of the events in her early life which, in turn, have led to inconsistencies in accounts of her life. These inconsistencies have been resolved as far as possible. Her early childhood was typical one for a child of her class and time in a European city. But after World War I, conditions in Germany became increasingly difficult. The period of the Weimar Republic (1918‚Äì1933), though a culturally stimulating time, was never stable. Conditions were made more difficult by the hyper-inflation of the early 1920s and the depression of 1929. During that time, things became increasingly difficult for the Neufeld family. By the time King's father died in 1930, when she was 14, the family had lost most of its money. Her older sisters supported her to stay at school until she finished, in 1932, which enabled her to get a good education. She would have liked to have gone on to university, possibly to study medicine, but, financially, that was out of the question.James Gleeson: Transcript of interview with Inge King, 18 October 1979, for the research library, National Library of Australia, Canberra, 21. Personal details and quotations in the article, unless otherwise noted, have come from pages 21-32 of this transcript. King was 17 when Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933. Two of her older sisters, now married, decided to emigrate: one to Palestine, another to the US. By 1934, when she was 18, King was effectively on her own.Her third sister subsequently died in the holocaust. She went to live with other young people in a small Zionist commune, where she worked in exchange for board and lodging. She said of this experience: \\"I owe them a lot ... This commune ... gave me or taught me some independence, which was invaluable\\", and, most importantly, taught her \\"to survive without money\\".Gleeson 21. King was starting to think about being an artist, though this was really a second choice. But art was something she could do with minimal resources, so long as she could support herself. King was influenced both by mediaeval sculpture and by Expressionist sculpture, an important part of German avant-garde art, and particularly by the work of the wood-carver, Ernst Barlach (1870‚Äì1938).Judith Trimble: Inge King Sculptor, 2-3. The Nazis considered such art to be decadent (Entartete Kunst) and later attempted to suppress it.Richard J. Evans: The Third Reich in Power, 168-175. A major exhibition of \\"degenerate art\\" was held in 1937. The exhibition was enormously popular, attracting more than 2 million visitors (Evans, 173). King went to see the artist K√§the Kollwitz (1867‚Äì1945), whose work she admired. Kollwitz‚Äô advice to King about a career in art was \\"Don‚Äôt do it if you can help it. It is so difficult\\". Nevertheless, King did go on. She said: \\"I haven‚Äôt regretted it. I agree with her, it‚Äôs difficult.\\"Gleeson, 22-23. King found a teacher, Hermann Nonnenmacher (1892‚Äì1988), a wood-carver influenced by Ernst Barlach, who taught her the basic skills of wood-carving and modelling in clay.Trimble, 4. King worked with him until she was accepted into the Berlin Academy of Fine Arts in 1937, when she was 21, one of only three non-Aryan students there (all women).Jane Eckett: \\"Binary Star: Inge and Grahame King\\", 3, n.4; also 4, n.8, which refers to records of the \\"Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandte Kunst\\". In the interview with Stanhope in 2006, King says that she started there in 1936-7, but this may be a mis-remembering. She was forced to leave about a year later, not long before Kristallnacht (9‚Äì10 November 1938). While she was there, she supported herself by undertaking commercial work (such as carving architectural ornaments) for the sculptor, Otto Hitzberger (1878‚Äì1964), who was on the staff there.Trimble, 4. Also Jane Eckett: \\"Renewed Vows\\", p 5, n 24. King finally got out of Germany in 1939, with the help of German friends. One helped her get a visa for England. Another warned her that he had received his mobilisation papers and that she should leave as soon as possible. She spent about a year in domestic service with families in southern England.Eckett, \\"Binary Star\\", 5. She found England far more old-fashioned and conservative than the Berlin she had come from. This was quite a shock. = London and Glasgow = She was accepted at the Royal Academy on the basis of the drawings she had brought with her and her time at the Berlin Academy. She spent two terms there, in 1940, before it was closed on account of the German bombing raids on London. She also went to evening classes in life drawing at the London Central School of Arts and Crafts until it moved to Northampton, where there were no facilities for sculpture. King then applied to the College of Art in Edinburgh, which accepted her, but Edinburgh was in a restricted area and King, as a foreign national, could not live there.Gleeson 24. They suggested she apply to the Glasgow School of Art. Glasgow was a quite cosmopolitan place. There had been a Jewish community there for many years, which brought intellectual and cultural energy to the Glasgow society. The war brought migrants and refugees into Britain. As Glasgow was not a protected area, it was one of the places where they could live. This brought a substantial increase in the number of Jewish residents in the city, as well as the development of a Polish community.Phillipa O'Brien: Margaret Priest: An Artist‚Äôs Life, 26. The head of sculpture at the Glasgow School of Art was Benno Schotz (1891‚Äì1984). Born in Estonia of Jewish parents, he migrated to Glasgow as a young man and studied sculpture at night-classes while working for a shipbuilding company. Being foreign-born, Schotz was not liable to be called up for war work, so the sculpture department at the School of Art functioned throughout the war.O'Brien, 26, 28. He was an excellent teacher: \\"[He] had excellent rapport with his small group of students. Formal classes were held in the morning, then they had the studio to themselves for the rest of the day and into the evening. ... Schotz had the highly developed technical skills of a successful practising artist and was alive to the hands-on realities of making sculpture as much as he was to the compelling political and social ideas of the times.\\"Brien, 29. Pages 28-43 give an account of classes at Glasgow with Benno Schotz. He also \\"supported refugees and worked throughout his life to bring their suffering to public notice. His home was a meeting place for artists, actors, writers, politicians and cultural leaders. He was an outstanding individual: energetic, intelligent humane and charming.\\"O‚ÄôBrien, 28. King entered the Glasgow School of Art in 1941. She spent three years there. She said of this time: \\"I was very happy in Glasgow. It was actually the only time I could just work the way I wanted to and I worked very hard.\\"Gleeson, 24. She \\"felt comfortable with [Schotz] with whom she shared a European background. He was an intelligent master who encouraged her to explore.... Years later King discovered that he had found her ‚Äòa very demanding student‚Äô\\".Trimble 5. A fellow student of Schotz's at Glasgow at this time was Margaret Priest, who later emigrated to Perth in Western Australia, where she became an important local sculptor.O‚ÄôBrien, 49ff. She was impressed by the cosmopolitan atmosphere and wider experience of the world brought to the Glasgow School by King and the other refugee students. She later recollected that: \\"There were assorted part-time students who came and went around the School of Art ... [King] was always free with advice and help and tools and materials so that they became absorbed in our group. We were an astonishing mixture of cultures and it did us the world of good. ... They all offered the same unstinting friendship and hospitality spiced with that wonderful Jewish humour. I wondered how they could all be so clever.\\"Quoted Trimble, 5; O‚ÄôBrien 26-7. The artwork produced by the refugee students at the art school was quite different from that of the other students. They \\"were doing harsh and emotional art fuelled by bitterness and anger. They had long conversations about K√§the Kollwitz and swapped books and newspapers about politics and art in Europe. Picasso‚Äôs Guernica of 1937 and his other war- inspired painting and sculpture and the work of other European artists were now the subject of endless discussion.\\"O'Brien 27. However, the cultural transition was not all one way. The Glasgow choirs sang Scottish folk songs and Afro-American spirituals: music that had been suppressed in Germany and was a revelation to refugees like King, who understood its relevance to the times.O‚ÄôBrien 27. In late 1942, Schotz organised an important exhibition of European Jewish art in Glasgow. Most of these works had been smuggled out of Europe. The exhibition included works by Camille Pissarro, Max Liebermann, Josef Herman, Jankel Adler, Chaim Soutine, Ossip Zadkine, Ernst Barlach and Benno Schotz himself.O'Brien 41. The Glasgow Art Gallery acquired a bronze sculpture by Ossip Zadkine, the Music Group, for its collection. The Glasgow Herald described it as the \\"outstanding item\\" among the recent acquisitions, \\"the first really ‚Äòmodern‚Äô piece of sculpture in the city‚Äôs permanent collection\\".The Glasgow Herald, 29 January 1943, page 2. King‚Äôs later piece, Musicians: Homage to Zadkine (1947), was a response to this work.Now in the National Gallery of Australia. Warsaw was another significant work by King from this period, a small sculpture whose inspiration comes from her response to the events in Europe. Having completed it, King knew that she would never make another work like it.Trimble, 9. Also now in the National Gallery of Australia. King finished her formal study in 1944. The next couple of years were difficult. She spent the time teaching in nursery schools, a job she liked but which she found demanding. She did not do any further work of her own until she returned to live in London. = Abbey Art Centre = Early in 1947, she went to live at the Abbey Art Centre, an artists' community located in New Barnet, Hertfordshire, near London.Eckett: \\"Binary Star\\", 7. King was a fairly early resident there.Gleeson, 25. Quite a number of Australian artists lived at the Abbey at various times. These included Robert Klippel, James Gleeson,Phillip Martin, Oliffe Richmond, Noel Counihan and Bernard Smith, who became an art historian. Grahame King, whom King later married, arrived later in 1947. King's early works at the Abbey were figurative, but not realistic. But it was during this period that King \\"made an arbitrary decision to move away from representational work\\". \\"I could not see how I could do any more with the figure, so I decided to move into what I call non-representational work. I don't like to call it abstraction as my work was not abstract in concept. I was groping for my own way.\\"Zara Stanhope: \\"Inge King: Playing Seriously\\", 1. In Artlink, vol 26 no 4, 2006. She had two exhibitions in London, then spent six months in Paris, which she enjoyed. In September 1949, she went to New York.Gleeson, 26. \\"[New York] was an incredible experience because, well, I really made a point of meeting people. I took some of my carvings with me and I exhibited them [in a gallery there].\\" People she met there included the sculptor Herbert Ferber, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. She saw her first Jackson Pollock show.Stanhope, 1. She found the American painters inspiring because of their vitality. Also \\"in 1949-50, New York ... after war-torn Europe, it was sparkling, it was clean, it was very safe still.\\"Gleeson, 27. She went to see Walter Gropius at Harvard, who was interested in her work. He offered to facilitate a scholarship for her for the Institute of Design in Chicago. Back in London, she and Grahame King decided to marry. As a German refugee, she could have emigrated to America, but Grahame, as an Australian, could not get a residency permit. She did not want to stay in Europe, and, after visiting New York, \\"equated Australia with the USA, as part of the bright new world where she could work in a lively and adventurous atmosphere and rear a family.\\"Trimble 17. The Kings left London for Melbourne early in 1951. = Melbourne = But Melbourne was not New York. King found it \\"almost Victorian\\".Stanhope 1. Her first impression of her adopted country was: \\"Rather flat, like a can of flat beer.\\"Gabriella Coslovich, The Age, 22/11/2003. But, she said, \\"I made up my mind I will not look back. You see, I had emigrated once, and the first emigration is the hardest to adjust to. I think people do not realise that. ... these experiences ... fundamentally it does something to your whole system.\\"Gleeson 29 She was unable to make sculpture for several years. But she knew that she could not go back to Germany to live.Trimble, 20. The Kings bought an acre of land on a bare hillside at Warrandyte, a small settlement in the Yarra valley, about 25 km north-east of Melbourne. In the early 1950s, it was a rural area, rather isolated, and lacking most of the services now taken for granted in suburban areas (such as roads, water, sewerage and electricity). The Kings asked the architect, Robin Boyd (cousin of the artist, Arthur Boyd), to design a house for them.Trimble, 22. Boyd designed a basic, one-roomed house, which could be extended in modules over time. They did much of the building work themselves. They moved into the house at Christmas, 1952. They had no electricity for the first six months and no hot-water system for three years and the house had tanks for water. They did not have a car for a couple of years. During this time, the Kings‚Äô two daughters, Joanna and Angela, were born. King later referred to their lifestyle at this time as ‚Äòsuburban pioneering‚Äô, though such pioneering was not uncommon in the outer suburbs of Melbourne at this time. The trees have now grown up on the once bare hillside. The windows at the front of the house look over a garden where King‚Äôs sculptures sit among the eucalypts and shrubs. Inside, the house is full of books and art works: small sculptures, paintings, prints, postcards, ceramics, aboriginal artefacts and bark paintings, cover every available surface. King said: \\"Robin Boyd used to come up here and say ‚ÄòThis house should look awful, but it doesn't.‚Äô\\"Rebecca Lancashire, The Age, 31/9/1992. King had to come to terms with her new country. > Building her own home and rearing children helped to bring a certain > stability to King‚Äôs life after the unsettling experience of leaving two > countries to live in a third.

The bush at Warrandyte looked strange to her when King first went there in 1951. But \\"Ten years later ... I started to adjust to this continent - and then it took another ten years to find my own style.\\"Memory Holloway, The Age, 22/9/1982. But as King noted: \\"Had I gone on living in Europe, my work would have been very different.\\"Quoted in Jenny Brown: \\"The Queen of Modern Sculpture\\", The Age, 24/9/2011.  Work in Australia  Inge King was at the forefront of the development of non-figurative sculpture in Australia.see Arnold Shore's October 1952 review of a joint show by Inge and Graham King at Peter Bray Gallery Melbourne: 'Inge King's art has \\"the gadget air\\"' (21 October 1952).

This group grew from a meeting convened by Julius Kane in Melbourne in 1961 to \\"help foster greater public awareness of contemporary sculpture in Australia\\". Members of the group included Julius Kane, Lenton Parr, Inge King, Vincas Jomantas, Clifford Last, Teisutis Zikaras and Norma Redpath. Many of King‚Äôs large-scale works are found in public spaces and on university campuses. She had more than 26 solo exhibitions and participated in more than 60 group exhibitions in Australia and New Zealand and also in London and New York. She had a retrospective exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1992 and a joint exhibition with her husband, the print-maker Grahame King, at McClelland Gallery in 2004. Another retrospective exhibition including the work of Grahame King (who died in 2008) was held at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2014. Inge King was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in January 1984. In 2009, the Australian Arts Council awarded her the Visual Arts Emeritus Award, in recognition of her central role in raising the profile of modern sculpture in Australia.‚ÄôProfessor Snell, Australian Arts Council Major works =Royal Australian Air Force Memorial= The Royal Australian Air Force Memorial, situated on Anzac Parade, Canberra, was King's first significant public commission, gained as the result of a competition. The memorial had to symbolise the aspirations and the achievements of the RAAF, as embodied in the Air Force motto: Per Ardua ad Astra (through adversity to the stars). It was installed in 1973. The structure consists of three stainless steel panels, reminiscent of aircraft wings, the tallest nearly 8 metres high, which are separate but related to each other. In the centre is a bronze structure standing on a plinth. A plaque mounted on the plinth explains that the \\"three upsurging wing shapes in ground stainless steel represent endurance, strength and courage, while the bronze flight image embodies man's struggle to conquer the elements\\".Trimble, 72. see images =Sun Ribbon= This work was installed in 1980, on a small lawn outside the Union Building at the heart of the University of Melbourne.Trimble 115.

It is centered on 64th Street west of Fifth Avenue. Built between 1847 and 1851 as a storehouse for arms and ammunition for the New York State Militia, the building is the second-oldest extant structure that was constructed within Central Park, predating the park's construction; only the 1814 Blockhouse No. 1 is older. The Arsenal was designed by Martin E. Thompson, originally trained as a carpenter, who had been a partner of Ithiel Town and went on to become one of the founders of the National Academy of Design. Thompson's symmetrical structure of brick in English bond, with headers every fifth course, presents a central block in the manner of a fortified gatehouse flanked by half-octagonal towers. The carpentry doorframe speaks of its purpose with a bald eagle displayed between stacks of cannonballs over the door, and crossed sabers and stacked pikes represented in flanking panels. The lobby contains a series of floor-to- ceiling murals by Allen Saalburg from 1935-36, combining historical vignettes of New York life during the Civil War with ornamental scrolls and arabesques.Crowther, Prudence. \\"When the Delay is the Gratification: Allen Saalburg,\\" Art in Print Vol. 7, No. 4 (November-December 2017), p. 31.

It was owned by businessman Michael Gaughan for most of its existence, although others have had a partial interest in the team. The team fielded the No. 62 and No. 77 Dodges for Michael's son, Brendan, fellow West Series driver Scott Lynch, and former Nextel Cup driver Steve Park. The team was notable for being the only NASCAR team based in the state of Nevada, on the grounds of Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Beginnings =Winston West= SPR debuted in the Winston West Series in a partnership with famous West Series owner Bill McAnally and famous racer Walker Evans. Running the famous No. 16 Chevrolet sponsored by NAPA Auto Parts and with former off-road racer Brendan Gaughan at the wheel, the combination scored nine victories and back-to-back West Series championships in 2000 and 2001. The team would later move Gaughan up to the Truck Series while running Scott Lynch in the West Series. McAnally would continue his West team with drivers such as Austin Cameron and Brian Ickler. Lynch continued to drive for the team, winning both Rookie of the Year and the West Series Championship in 2003. Glory days =Craftsman Truck Series= Truck No. 62 History During their championship run in the West Series, Orleans Racing made 5 starts in 2000, but only 3 in 2001. The latter year showed the NASCAR world what a single car team from Las Vegas could do, as Gaughan nearly pulled off an upset victory at the June race in Texas, but finished second to Jack Sprague in 2001. Gaughan and his Orleans Racing team would move up to the Trucks full-time in 2002 with NAPA and the number 62 to contend for Rookie of the Year honors. Despite the criticisms of many who said that a team based in the Western United States would not make it in NASCAR, Gaughan proved all of his detractors wrong by winning both races at Texas en route to an 11th-place finish in the points and the 2002 ROTY crown. In 2003 Orleans Racing would only improve, as Gaughan would win a series high six races, including his second consecutive sweep at Texas and a hometown victory at Vegas, heading into the season finale at Homestead. In an ironic twist, lady luck would deal the Orleans team a bad hand, as Gaughan was taken out in a wreck on lap 101 with Marty Houston and finished fourth in points behind Travis Kvapil. The team's underdog status moved Gaughan up into the Nextel Cup Series, to drive for Roger Penske in 2004. While Gaughan was in Cup, Orleans tapped former Cup driver Steve Park to wheel their No. 62. Park would take his first career Truck Series win at Fontana in 2005, but struggled with consistency and was released before season's end. Scott Lynch would take over the No. 62 for the last races of the season, but like Park, struggled and was released. With the reduction in manufacturer support from Dodge, Orleans was forced to downsize to only the No. 77 truck in 2006. Truck No. 77 History The No. 77 truck debuted as the No. 61 truck driven by West Series driver Scott Lynch, who scored 12th-place finishes at Homestead and Phoenix. After his release from Penske, Brendan returned to Orleans Racing in 2005. However, the season proved difficult due to the increase in competition and Gaughan could only muster a 19th-place finish in the points. In 2006, the team changed its name from Orleans Racing to South Point Racing, due to Michael's acquisition of South Coast Casino in exchange for selling Coast Casinos to Boyd Gaming. A high for the newly named South Point Racing was a second-place finish at Homestead and a 15th-place finish in points. The team, switching manufacturers to Chevrolet, climbed to 11th in points, with a near win at Texas. Demise For 2008, SPR was to merge with Toyota team Wyler Racing to form Wyler-Gaughan Racing. The partnership, however, would involve the Gaughans leaving their home state of Nevada for Mooresville, North Carolina and switching manufacturers to Toyota, along with having a teammate, Richard Johns. However, for unknown reasons, the deal fell through and South Point Racing was disbanded, with only Brendan and 10‚Äì12 of his crew remaining, eventually moving to Circle Bar Racing. The shop was inactive for three months but was most recently used by Cup teams as a shelter during the extremely rainy Auto Club 500.

The lineup also included bassist Howard Messer, guitarist Pat Couchois, and drummer Chris Couchois. The band released two albums on Decca Records: Ratchell in 1971 and Ratchell II in 1972. Biography Larry Byrom, after leaving Steppenwolf in 1971, founded Ratchell with three childhood friends from Alabama. Two of the members had previously played with Byrom in the band T.I.M.E. (Trust in Men Everywhere). Ratchell was signed by MCA Records for what Billboard described as \\"one of the heaviest advances in years\\". Their self-titled debut album was released on MCA subsidiary Decca Records in 1971. Ratchell, which featured songwriting from all four band members, peaked at number 176 on the Billboard 200 chart in April 1972. The album received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, with Billboard remarking that the band's material \\"would serve well on any progressive rock station [...] or a hip Top 40 station into LP acts.\\" Ronald Marchetti of The Morning Record said the band's music \\"could most easily be described as unobtrusive, tasteful, and anemic.\\" Perry Fulkerson of the Evening Independent likened Ratchell to the debut album of Crosby, Stills & Nash, and that the sound of the former \\"combines a Carlos Santana-type guitar with a good beat and light, harmonious vocals.\\" Ratchell's second album, Ratchell II, was released on Decca in 1972. It failed to chart and the band soon dissolved. By the end of the decade, Byrom moved to Nashville to work as a songwriter and session musician, while the Couchois brothers and Messer formed the pop-rock band Couchois and released two albums for Warner Bros.

Enzyme hydrolysis occurs by the breakage of a phosphoanhydride bond and is dependent on Mg2+ ions that are held in complex by the enzyme. This shows the full enzyme with ADP-Ribose bound in the active site pocket. Blue and red areas on the surface represent polar residues that assist in the creation of the active site pocket. From . The C-terminal domain of ADP-ribose diphosphatase contains the Nudix sequence, a highly conserved amino acid sequence that is found in over 450 putative proteins in about 90 different species. A part of this sequence known as the Nudix fold is the catalytic part of the sequence. It is a structurally conserved loop-helix-loop motif that creates a scaffold for metal binding and pyrophosphatase chemistry in the enzyme. ADP-ribose hydrolases in general act as protective agents against excessive intracellular accumulation of ADP-ribose, as high intracellular levels of ADP-ribose can be damaging to the cell. ADP-ribose diphosphatase, in particular, hydrolyzes ADP-ribose into AMP and D-ribose 5-phosphate, both of which are intermediates of central metabolic pathways and therefore are easily reused. Other common names for ADP-ribose diphosphatase include ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase and ADPRase. ADP-ribose is commonly referred to as ADPR. Structure This shows how H-bonds and Mg2+ coordinate and hold the AMPCPR substrate (an analog of ADP-ribose) in complex with the enzyme. Active site amino acids are shown, as well as two important active site water molecules. From . ADPRase is a dimer of two identical monomers, each of which contain 209 amino acids. The two monomers are folded into two distinct structural domains and with two equivalent catalytic sites. The C-terminal domain consists of the Nudix sequence mentioned above and the N-terminal domain is primarily involved in dimer stabilization. As noted earlier, the Nudix fold is the catalytic part of the enzyme, but both domains are involved in the active site and they both help with the attachment and coordination of H2O, Mg2+, and the ADP-ribose substrate. This shows how two Mg2+ coordinate the attacking water molecule and how the third Mg2+ bridges the two phosphates on ADP-ribose. Distances between the Mg2+ and the substrate are shown in angstroms. H-bonds to the catalytic glutamate are also shown. From . The adjacent picture shows the active site of ADPRase in complex with AMPCPR and Mg2+. AMPCPR is a nonhydrolyzable analog of ADP-ribose, and thus functions as an inhibitor of ADPRase. The picture below reveals the first and second Mg2+ ions, which serve to coordinate the attacking water molecule so that it is perfectly in line with the scissile bond (O-P-O bond is 177 degrees) and poised for attack. A glutamate side chain (E162) will deprotonate the water molecule, and then the hydroxide ion will attack nucleophilically. This occurs when the water molecule is 3.0 angstroms away from the phosphorus molecule it is attacking. By using H2O18, it has been found that the water molecule attacks the adenosyl phosphate. This evidence is a refutation of a previous study that suggested that hydrolysis of ADP-ribose could proceed by nucleophilic attack at either alpha- or beta- phosphate (Gabelli, et al. 2001). After the water molecule attacks, an intermediate is formed, and then ribose 5-phosphate is kicked off as a leaving group. The third active site Mg2+ ion is used to stabilize the negative charge of the phosphate group as it leaves, and is thus situated perfectly between the two phosphates. When the substrate is bound, the structure of the enzyme differs in shape. With the substrate bound, Loop L9 moves 10 angstroms from its original position in the free enzyme, which forms a tighter turn and brings E162 to its catalytic position, meaning this enzyme cycles between an open (free enzyme) and a closed (substrate-metal complex) conformation. This is important because it prevents nonspecific hydrolysis of other nucleotides. ADPRase is highly specific for ADPR, as it has been shown that its Km for ADPR is lower by at least two orders of magnitude than for other sugar nucleotides. Mechanism The hydrolysis of ADPR is catalyzed by E162, which improves the nucleophilicity of the water molecule in the active site by deprotonating it. This water is held perfectly in line with the scissile bond by the first and second magnesium ions. The hydroxide ion then attacks the phosphorus atom on the adenosyl phosphate, creating a trigonal bypyramidal intermediate with a negatively charged oxygen attached to the adenosyl phosphate. The double bond is then reformed, effectively discharging ribose 5-phosphate as a leaving group. The third Mg2+ is used to stabilize the negative charge on the leaving group. Image:Mechanism(2).gif Enzyme functions ADP-ribose is an intermediate that is produced during the metabolism of NAD+, mono- or poly- unsaturated proteins, and cyclic-ADP ribose. ADP-ribose is a protein-glycating agent, and excess levels of ADP-ribose in the cell can cause non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation. Non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation can inactivate protein targets that contain nucleotide-binding sites when the adenylate moiety of ADP-ribose binds to them, and it can also interfere with metabolic regulation that occurs via enzymatic ADP-ribosylation. For example, actin polymerization is inhibited by non-enzymatic ADP-ribosylation at a Cys residue. Thus, it is believed that ADPRase functions in general as a house-cleaning enzyme to eliminate potentially deleterious ADP-ribose from the cell. In the literature, the detoxifying role of ADPRase is directly supported in E. coli cells. But in mammalian cells, there is only an indirect evidence linking ADPRase to a detoxifying role, and this comes from studies of the very specific rat liver ADPRibase-I by cytotoxic agents.

Sun Quan's forces, led by L√º Meng, invaded Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province, which covered present-day Hubei and Hunan. The campaign occurred after the Battle of Fancheng and concluded with victory for Sun Quan's forces, who completely captured all of Liu Bei's territories. Guan Yu, Liu Bei's general guarding those territories, was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces. The fall of Jing Province and Guan Yu's death provided the trigger for the Battle of Xiaoting between Liu Bei and Sun Quan between 221 and 222. Background =Sun Quan \\"lending\\" Jing Province to Liu Bei= In 210, Liu Bei travelled to Jing (‰∫¨; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to meet Sun Quan and request for the governorship of Jing Province.

He left Guan Yu behind to guard his territories in Jing Province during his absence. At the time, tensions were rising at the Sun‚ÄìLiu border in Jing Province as both sides became more suspicious and wary of each other. Around July 215, Sun Quan asked Liu Bei to \\"return\\" three commanderies in southern Jing Province ‚Äì Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang ‚Äì since the latter already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan decided to seize the three commanderies by force. He stationed himself at Lukou (Èô∏Âè£; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) while ordering L√º Meng to lead troops to attack the three commanderies and Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu. After L√º Meng succeeded in capturing Lingling by trickery and persuading the administrators of Changsha and Guiyang to surrender to Sun Quan's side, he then led his troops to Yiyang to reinforce Lu Su. When Liu Bei heard about it, he returned to Gong'an County and ordered Guan Yu to lead an army to stop L√º Meng.(ÂèäÁæΩËàáËÇÖÈÑ∞ÁïåÔºåÊï∏ÁîüÁãêÁñëÔºåÁñÜÂü∏Á¥õÈåØÔºåËÇÖÂ∏∏‰ª•Ê≠°Â•ΩÊí´‰πã„ÄÇÂÇôÊó£ÂÆöÁõäÂ∑ûÔºåÊ¨äÊ±ÇÈï∑Ê≤ô„ÄÅÈõ∂„ÄÅÊ°ÇÔºåÂÇô‰∏çÊâøÊó®ÔºåÊ¨äÈÅ£ÂëÇËíôÁéáË°ÜÈÄ≤Âèñ„ÄÇÂÇôËÅûÔºåËá™ÈÇÑÂÖ¨ÂÆâÔºåÈÅ£ÁæΩÁà≠‰∏âÈÉ°„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54. During this time, Guan Yu had a standoff with Lu Su at Yiyang, where he planned to lead 5,000 elite soldiers to cross the upstream shallows at night. In response, Lu Su ordered Gan Ning to lead 1,000 troops to guard their side of the shallows. Guan Yu did not dare to cross the shallows and instead ordered his men to make camp on their side.

Although the talks were inconclusive, the territorial dispute eventually ended by the end of August 215 when Liu Bei decided to give in upon learning that Cao Cao was attacking Hanzhong Commandery. As Hanzhong was the \\"northern gateway\\" into Yi Province, Cao Cao would pose a greater threat to Liu Bei's base in Yi Province if he succeeded in conquering Hanzhong, so Liu Bei had to switch to countering Cao Cao in Hanzhong. Liu Bei and Sun Quan then withdrew their forces after agreeing to divide southern Jing Province between them along the Xiang River. =Battle of Fancheng= In August 219, following Liu Bei's victory over Cao Cao in the Hanzhong Campaign in June that year, Guan Yu decided to follow up by attacking Cao Cao's stronghold at Fancheng (Ê®äÂüé; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was guarded by Cao Ren. Cao Cao ordered Yu Jin to lead reinforcements to help Cao Ren. It was in autumn and there were heavy showers so the Han River flooded and destroyed Yu Jin's reinforcements.

After Yu Jin's defeat, Cao Cao considered relocating the imperial capital from Xu (Ë®±; present-day Xuchang, Henan) further north into Hebei because Xu was too near enemy territory. However, Sima Yi and Jiang Ji reminded him that Sun Quan would feel restless if Guan Yu managed to capture Fancheng since he already felt uneasy about Liu Bei's growing influence. They suggested to Cao Cao to ally with Sun Quan and get him to help them hinder Guan Yu's advances.

Invasion of Jing Province By November 219, Sun Quan had already secretly agreed to ally with Cao Cao against Liu Bei. He ordered L√º Meng and others to lead troops to invade Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province while he followed behind with reinforcements. At Xunyang (Â∞ãÈôΩ; present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), L√º Meng ordered his men to hide in vessels disguised as civilian and merchant ships and sail towards Jiangling, the capital of Nan Commandery. Along the way, L√º Meng employed infiltration tactics to disable the surveillance towers set up along the river so that Guan Yu would be unaware of the invasion.(Ê¨äËÅû‰πãÔºåÈÅÇË°åÔºåÂÖàÈÅ£ËíôÂú®Ââç„ÄÇËíôËá≥Â∞ãÈôΩÔºåÁõ°‰ºèÂÖ∂Á≤æÂÖµ[][]‰∏≠Ôºå‰ΩøÁôΩË°£ÊêñÊ´ìÔºå‰ΩúÂïÜË≥à‰∫∫ÊúçÔºåÊôùÂ§úÂÖºË°åÔºåËá≥ÁæΩÊâÄÁΩÆÊ±üÈÇäÂ±ØÂÄôÔºåÁõ°Êî∂Á∏õ‰πãÔºåÊòØÊïÖÁæΩ‰∏çËÅûÁü•„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 54.

Formerly a port and a mining centre, it is now purely residential, benefiting from its location between the A595 trunk road and the Cumbrian Coast railway line. History =Beginnings= The sheltered anchorage in Parton Bay was used by the Romans, who had a fort on the high ground to the north of the present village, beneath St Bridget's Church. The platform of the fort can still be seen today. Later, the bay was used by the inhabitants of Low Moresby, the hamlet which grew up to the east of the old fort in the Middle Ages. In Elizabethan times a number of small merchant vessels were based in the bay, trading as far as Chester; by this time there was probably also a salt-pan in operation. The port was developed in the early 17th century to cater for Moresby's coal trade, but fell into decline after two generations of the Lowther family turned the hamlet of Whitehaven into a major port. Although the Lowthers theoretically had the legal power to prevent port development at Parton, entrepreneur Thomas Lamplugh teamed up with Henry Fletcher, lord of the manor of Moresby, to \\"repair\\" the harbour at Parton, following which Fletcher sold off plots for development along the shore. Within about five years (boosted by Lamplugh's private Act of Parliament in 1705 to break the Lowthers' legal power) a new port community had developed, mainly serving local collieries, but also including industrial facilities such as a glassworks ‚Äì which was able to export bottles as far as London thanks to the improved harbour. =18th century prosperity= The original villageUnfortunately, Parton Bay is not as well sheltered as Whitehaven, and within about 15 years, Lamplugh was unable to afford maintenance costs (possibly a contributory factor to the closure of the glassworks and salt-pan about this time). The manor of Moresby was bought in 1722 by one Thomas Brougham, who was able to sideline Lamplugh and develop the port himself, but ironically, in 1738, he sold his rights to the Lowther family. Surprisingly, rather than shut down the port which rivalled Whitehaven, they used it themselves for some of their coal shipments, and Parton prospered for decades. New industries developed, most notably a brewery, but everything was nearly wrecked in 1795, when a storm destroyed the harbour breakwaters. With such extensive damage, the harbour reverted to being a little fishing haven, but the village industries had enough local custom to survive, for a while at least. Surprisingly, a new and important industrial concern opened to the north of the village in 1800- the Lowca engineering company. In 1817, the large tannery at the south end of the village was bought for development as a colliery; the coal being mined some distance inland and brought to Parton along a tunnel called the Parton Drift, which also drained the mine workings. To convey coal to the port of Whitehaven a horse-drawn tramway was built along the foot of the cliffs. =19th century onward= In 1840 the Lowca engineering works of Tulk and Ley made the first locomotive for the new Maryport and Carlisle Railway, but ironically, it had to be transported from Parton by seagoing barge. Not until several years later was the technically challenging railway extension to Whitehaven via Parton developed. The railway soon supplanted the old tramway, and brought new opportunities for Parton's industries. The colliery, the engineering works and the brewery all thrived, an iron-foundry opened next to the new railway station, and in the 1870s an ironworks was established on the shore near the Lowca works. Unfortunately, the end of the 19th century was a period of industrial consolidation, and Parton's relatively small businesses began to struggle. By the 1920s, almost all were gone, and Parton became a dormitory town for collieries around Lowca and Whitehaven. Many of the houses in the old village were over 200 years old by this time, and were classified as slums, so over the next half-century new housing estates were developed on top of the Brows- the escarpment overlooking the old port. Although the local collieries have all closed, Parton's dormitory function continues, thanks to its good transport access. Moresby Hall (now a hotel) and parish church remain, just outside the village boundary, on the high ground to the north of Parton.

Its goal was to defend parliamentary democracy against internal subversion and extremism from the left and right, to teach the population to respect the new Republic, to honor its flag and the constitution. Its name is derived from the Flag of Germany adopted in 1919, the colors of which were associated with liberal parliamentary democracy and the republic, and themselves had first appeared together on a state flag, within a German- ethnicity sovereign state in 1778. While the Reichsbanner was set up as a multiparty organization, it came to be strongly associated with the Social Democratic Party and viewed as their paramilitary force. The headquarters of the Reichsbanner was located in Magdeburg, but it had branches elsewhere.On its regional organization, especially in the state of Saxony, see Carsten Voigt: Das Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold in Sachsen 1924 bis 1933, in: Jahrbuch f√ºr Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung, No.III/2009. The Reichsbanner's main opponents were the Communist Party of Germany and their Rotfrontk√§mpferbund on the left, and the Nazi Party and their Sturmabteilung on the right. Following the Nazi takeover, Reichsbanner members played a central role in the anti-Nazi resistance. The Reichsbanner was re-established in 1953, as Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, Bund aktiver Demokraten e.V. as an association for political education.  Establishment and objectives  Meeting in 1929 Right wing and nationalist armed groups, like Der Stahlhelm or the SA, as well as the left-wing Communist Red Front Fighters had continued to radicalize and intensify the political struggle in Germany. The Reichsbanner was initially formed in reaction to the far right's \\"Beer Hall\\" Putsch and far left's Hamburg rebellion, both failed coups, which had taken place at the end of 1923. On 22 February 1924 members of the SPD, the German Centre Party, the German Democratic Party and trade unionists in Magdeburg established the Reichsbanner. However the proportion of Social Democrats in the membership clearly outweighed all others, with estimates of up to 90 per cent. In the fall of 1927 the Reichsbanner expelled all members belonging to the Old Social Democratic Party, accusing the party of seeking alliances with fascists. Reichsbanner was a veterans' federation, in which former soldiers of the First World War enlisted their military experience in the service of the republic. It thus saw its main task as the defense of the Weimar Republic against enemies from the National Socialist, monarchist and Communist camps. Social Democratic politician Otto H√∂rsing designated Reichsbanner in 1931 as a 'non- partisan protection organization of the Republic and democracy in the fight against the swastika and the Soviet star'.Zitiert nach Franz Osterroth, Dieter Schuster: Chronik der deutschen Sozialdemokratie. 2. Vom Beginn der Weimarer Republik bis zum Ende des Zweiten Weltkrieges; Berlin [u.a.] 19803; Elektronische Ausgabe: Bonn: FES-Library (Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung), 2001 Members saw themselves as guardians of the inheritance of Germany's democratic tradition, going back to the Revolutions of 1848, and of the constitutional national colors: black, red and gold. Structure and organisation In the Reichsbanner, two organizational structures existed in parallel: the political as a registered political association and the operational as a fighting force. The political organization was headed by the Federal Administration comprising a 1st and 2nd chairman, three deputies, the federal treasurer, federal cashier, secretary, technical manager, federal youth leader, the sitting representatives and 15 assessors. The Federal Chairman was from 3 June 1932 Otto H√∂rsing. His deputy and later successor was Karl H√∂ltermann. Beneath the federal level, Germany was divided up into gaus, circles, districts and finally local associations. The executive committees of all organizational levels were elected from the membership of the all republican parties in concert. Parallel to it, the operational organization was modeled as a military structure. The smallest unit was the group, with a group leader and eight men. Two to five groups formed a platoon (Zug), two to three courses formed a Kameradschaft, which corresponded to a company of the army, between two and five of which constituted a department (Abteilung) with two to five departments making up a district. At least two districts formed a circle. At Gau and federal level operational and political level structures overlapped so that The Federal Chairman was at the same time also Federal Commander, while each of the 32 Gau chairmen was also Gauf√ºhrer. The command personnel of the operational organisation were also recognized by badges of rank. The Federal Commander, for example, wore on his lower sleeve the federal eagle (black on a red field, with golden circular border) and two black-red-golden stripes over all. According to the organization's own records, membership in 1932 was put at three million. Fight for the Republic, 1930‚Äì1933 Reichsbanner marching 1930. Following substantial Nazi electoral successes in 1930, the Reichsbanner in September sought to strengthen itself against intensified street violence by SA units with a restructuring of the operational organization. Active members were divided into master formations (Stafo) and the elite units into protection formations (Schufo). In addition there were the \\"Young Banners\\". 250,000 men belonged to the Schufos in Spring 1931. On 16 December 1931, the Reichsbanner, the Workers' Gymnastic and Sporting Federation (ATSB), the General German Trade Union Federation (ADGB), and the Social Democratic Party formed the Iron Front, within which armed defensive operations were the responsibility of Reichsbanner and which became increasingly important in view of ever more intensifying acts of violence by members of the Nazi SA and the Communist Red Front (RFB). The last federal general assembly of the Reichsbanner met on 17‚Äì18 February 1933 in Berlin. In March Reichsbanner and the Iron Front were banned throughout the Reich. The membership of both organizations were systematically hunted down for deportation to concentration camps and partially exterminated. Following the banning of the Reichsbanner, some members joined Der Stahlhelm, which led to an incident where a mass signup in Braunschweig was raided by the Nazis, who called it the Stahlhelm Putsch. Reichsbanner members in the Resistance In the now illegal underground organisations, the organisation's membership, in particular the former Schufos represented an important component in the Social Democratic resistance to the Nazi regime, for example the groups centred on Theodor Haubach and Karl Heinrich in Berlin and around Walter Schmedemann in Hamburg as well as the Socialist Front in Hanover. Reichsbanner members today The Reichsbanner was re-formed in 1953 as an association for political education.

It provides the basic clustering services at the operating-system level that enable Oracle Database software to run in clustering mode. In earlier versions of Oracle (release 9i and earlier), RAC required a vendor-supplied clusterware like Sun Cluster or Veritas Cluster Server (except when running on Linux or on Microsoft Windows).  Oracle Clusterware Components  Oracle Clusterware is the software which enables the nodes to communicate with each other, allowing them to form the cluster of nodes which behaves as a single logical server. Oracle Clusterware is run by Cluster Ready Services (CRS) consisting of two key components: Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR), which records and maintains the cluster and node membership information; voting disk, which polls for consistent heartbeat information from all the nodes when the cluster is running, and acts as a tiebreaker during communication failures. The CRS service has four components, each handling a variety of functions: Cluster Ready Services daemon (CRSd), Oracle Cluster Synchronization Service Daemon (OCSSd), Event Volume Manager Daemon (EVMd), and Oracle Process Clusterware Daemon (OPROCd). Failure or death of the CRS daemon can cause node failure, which triggers automatic reboots of the nodes to avoid the corruption of data (due to the possible failure of communication between the nodes), also known as fencing. The CRS daemon runs as \\"root\\" (super user) on UNIX platforms and runs as a service on Windows platforms.  CRSd  The following functions are provided by the Oracle Cluster Ready Services daemon (CRSd): * CRS is installed and run from a different ORACLE_HOME known as ORA_CRS_HOME, which is independent of ORACLE_HOME. * CRSd manages the resources like starting and stopping the services and failing-over the application resources. It spawns separate processes to manage application resources. * CRS daemon has two modes of running. During startup and after a shutdown. During planned clusterware start it is started as ‚Äòreboot‚Äô mode. It is started as ‚Äòrestart‚Äô mode after unplanned shutdown. * In reboot mode it ‚Äòauto‚Äô starts all the resources under its management. In restart mode it prevails the previous state and brings back the resources to it previous state before shutdown * Manages the Oracle Cluster Registry and stores the current known state in the Oracle Cluster Registry * Runs as ‚Äòroot‚Äô on Unix and ‚ÄòLocalSystem‚Äô on windows and automatically restarts in case of failure. * CRS requires the public interface, private interface and the Virtual IP (VIP) for the operation. All these interfaces should be up and running, and they should be able to ping each other before starting CRS Installation. Without the above network infrastructure CRS cannot be installed.  OCSSd  Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services daemon (OCSSd) provides basic ‚Äògroup services‚Äô support. Group Services is a distributed group membership system that allows the applications to coordinate activities to achieve a common result. As such, it provides synchronization services between nodes, access to the node membership information, as well as enabling basic cluster services, including cluster group services and cluster locking. It can also run without integration with vendor clusterware. Failure of OCSSd causes the machine to reboot to avoid a split-brain situation. This is also required in a single instance configuration if Automatic Storage Management (ASM) is used. ASM was a new feature in Oracle 10g. OCSSd runs as the \\"oracle\\" user. The following functions are provided by the Oracle Cluster Synchronization Services daemon (OCSSd): * ‚ÄôGroup Services‚Äô uses vendor-provided clusterware group services when the latter is available, but is also capable of working independently if that is unavailable * ‚ÄòLock Services‚Äô provides the basic cluster-wide serialization locking functions, and uses a FIFO mechanism to manage locking * 'Node Services' uses OCR to store state data, and updates the information during reconfiguration. It also manages the OCR data, which is static otherwise.  EVMd  The third component in OCS is the Event Volume Management Logger daemon (EVMd). EVMd spawns a permanent child process called \\"evmlogger\\" and generates events. The EVMd child process ‚Äòevmlogger‚Äô spawns new children processes on demand and scans the callout directory to invoke callouts. It will restart automatically on failures and death of the EVMd process does not halt the instance. EVMd runs as the \\"oracle\\" user.  OPROCd  OPROCd provides the server fencing solution for the Oracle Clusterware. It is the process monitor for Oracle Clusterware and it uses the hang check timer or watchdog timer (depending on the implementation) for the cluster integrity. OPROCd is locked in the memory and runs as a real time process. This sleeps for a fixed time and runs as the \\"root\\" user. Failure of the OPROCd process causes the node to restart. OPROCd is so important that even it is being monitored by a process called OCLSOMON and causes a cluster node to reboot if OPROCd is hung.

During the Pacific War, they were used as administrative flagships for various fleets, such as submarine command and control, and to command escort squadrons. The ships were upgraded as the war progressed with additional anti-aircraft guns and depth charges. Design Originally ordered by the IJN in the 1937 and 1939 Supplementary Naval budgets, the Katori-class cruisers were purpose- designed to replace the aging armored cruisers in the officer training role, and as such differed from other IJN cruisers in several aspects. Built to commercial standards to minimize cost, the Katori class had a lower length-to- beam ratio than was usual for cruisers, giving the ships greater initial stability for trainees unfamiliar with lives at sea. Unusually for IJN ships, the Katori class had mixed steam turbine/diesel propulsion, intended to maximize the ships' instructional value rather than speed: even at a combined 8000 shp the maximum speed was only 18 knots, too slow for conventional cruiser duties. The main armament of each ship was four guns in two twin-gun turrets, the same type used on the light cruiser Y≈´bari, in \\"A\\" and \\"Y\\" positions. These were supplemented by a pair of AA guns in \\"X\\" position, two pairs of 25 mm AA guns, and two pairs of torpedoes. Four single 50 mm saluting guns were also carried.

It lies on the north shore of the Firth of Forth, around west of Limekilns and south-west of Dunfermline. History Charlestown was established in 1756 by Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin. The planned village is laid out in the shape of a letters C and E, for Charles Elgin. It was established as a harbour town for the shipment of coal mined on Lord Elgin's Fife estates, and for the production of lime. The harbour's outer basin was built around 1840. In 1887, on the occasion of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, the Queen's Hall was built at the village centre, to designs by Robert Rowand Anderson. Shipbuilding was carried on at Charlestown in the 19th century, as well as ship-breaking. Some of the German Imperial Fleet were brought here from Scapa Flow after World War I to be broken up.  The Lime Kilns  The fourteen massive lime kilns built of dressed-sandstone are a remarkable feature of Charlestown. They are regarded as one of the most important Industrial Revolution remains in Scotland and indeed the United Kingdom, being Scottish Category A Listed buildings. Built into the hillside below the village, they form a stone facade 110 metres long by 10 metres high. They are in a generally stable state of preservation with many features relating to the operation of the kilns still in situ. Most of the kilns were re-faced, probably in the C19. The kilns were built by Charles Bruce, 5th Earl of Elgin, in the late C18, building dates quoted vary, but Pevsner states that the first nine were built 1777 to 1778 and the last five in 1792. They were the largest group of lime kilns in Scotland, producing a third of all lime production, and were particularly important to agriculture for soil improvement but also for building work to produce mortar, plaster and other lime based products. The Lime Kilns, view looking north, showing Kilns 1 to 11. Through the late C18 and C19, the kilns were part of a major industrial complex of the time, including coal mining, ironworking and salt extraction. Coal and limestone were brought in from the local quarries, also on the Earl‚Äôs estate. The adjacent harbour was as well built by the Earl and used for transporting the lime products, limestone and importantly coal. There were local railway lines, also a railway link to Dunfermline. Around the lime kilns there were many ancillary buildings, these have almost entirely gone. The operation ran down from the 1930s and finally closed in 1956. The site is owned by the Broomhall Estate.  The Planned Village  Another distinctive feature of Charlestown is the early planned village, established again by Charles Bruce, the 5th Earl in 1756. It is however quite an unusual ‚Äòplan‚Äô, as the street pattern was reputedly laid out as the letters C and E, for Charles Elgin. The Planned Village, view looking east, the North Row to the Left, Middle Row to the right. The village was part of the Improving Movement in Scotland that led to the establishment of some 500 planned villages and small towns throughout the country between the mid C18 to mid C19, although McWilliam writing earlier in 1975 gives a lower figure for the same period of some 200 towns. Charlestown however has the distinction of perhaps being one of the first industrial villages in Scotland, as against the numerous farming and fishing based planned villages. This was because it encompassed not only the housing accommodation for the workers, but an integrated operation of coalmining, limestone quarrying, tramways, lime kilns, the harbour and other ancillary operations. Building of the original village was commenced in 1756, and comprises the North Row, the South Row, the Double Row and also the shorter Hall Row and Lochaber to the east. The western half of the North and South Rows face the village green. Most house building was complete by 1771, although some houses were not completed until the early C19. The houses were originally single story, built in groups of six, some of them later extended to a second floor. As well, various other buildings were erected by the Earl, for example Easter Cottage built 1760, a school in 1768 and the Sutlery, being a stable and granary, in 1770. Ordnance Survey map, 6\\" to mile scale, 1856, with street names overlaid, the map Copyright: National Library of Scotland. The houses are all Scottish B Grade Listed Buildings (excepting nos 36,37 and 52 to 55) within the Charlestown Conservation Area. While all were originally ‚Äòestate‚Äô cottages belonging to the Broomhall Estate, after the decline and closure of most of the works in 1935, many were sold to the tenants. The original unity and appearance of the terraces is now somewhat compromised by alterations to doors and windows, high privet hedges and by many rear extensions, as identified in the Conservation Plan. Paths Some of the off- road paths in the village reflect aspects of the past; for example, \\"Shell Road\\" and \\"Lime Brae\\" indicate the routes over which these materials were transported in the past; \\"Craw Road\\" and \\"Rocks Road\\" refer to the avian inhabitants and the underfoot surface respectively; \\"The Run\\" refers to the route by which surplus water was run off from the upper part of the village and down to the sea. Cricket Charlestown is the home of Broomhall Cricket Club, named after Broomhall, the nearby home of Lord Elgin. They have a 1st XI and a 2nd XI that play in the Scottish East League run by the East of Scotland Cricket Association and have junior, midweek and Sunday teams as well. They play at The Cairns, Charlestown.Broomhall Cricket Club Homepage The Scottish Lime Centre  The Scottish Lime Centre Trust (SLCT) was established in 1994 by a pioneer in the re-introduction of lime in building repairs in Scotland, Pat Gibbons (Mrs Patricia). She was the founder and first Director, an architect with many years experience of building conservation in Scotland. Previously she had been a Senior Architect with Historic Scotland. The Director since 2005 is Roz Artis. Housed in an historic Charlestown building, the former Estate workshop, the Centre enjoys an international reputation for its work in promoting and training in the use of lime in building. The aims and objectives of the Trust are to: * Promote for the public benefit the appropriate repair of Scotland's traditional and historic buildings * Advance education through the provision of advice, training and practical experience in the use of lime for the repair and conservation of such buildings * Promote and further the preservation and development of Scottish building traditional, crafts and skills.Scottish Lime Centre References Villages in Fife Firth of Forth Lime kilns Model villages Industrial Revolution in Scotland ","title":"Charlestown, Fife"},{"id":"14337660","text":"Lt-Gen Chit Swe BC-6463 (;) was a former Minister for Agriculture and Forestry, minister for Co-Operatives and minister for Livestock and Fisheries in Myanmar. Biography Chit Swe was born on January 18, 1932 in Matkayay Street, Tin Baw ward, Mawlamyaing in Burma. He is the fourth son of U Hla Baw from A Pon Chan, Mon State and Daw Khin Tint from Chaung Son, Mon State. His parents are Mon natives so he too is a Mon. His Religion is Buddhist. His real name is Chit Swe but he was called \\"Pwa Pwa\\" because he was white, strong and fat in childhood. When he was five years old he started attending Mawlamyaing Buddhist High School. His father worked in the post office of Mawlamyaing. When his father was promoted to Inspector of Post Offices, at the Post Office of Bago, his whole family moved to Bago. He rode his first train when they were moving. In Bago he lived in Lat Pyar Kan street. In Bago he attended Mcgrath Private School, located in Charch in the east of the ward. He can speak and write English because of his teacher in Charch. His school name was \\"Charle Hla Baw\\" and his younger sister's name is Ivy Hla Baw. His mother, Daw Khin Tint died in 1940 at 38 years of age due to tuberculosis. His elder brother, U Ba Kyaw, is an artist and his second elder brother is a Japan revolutionary soldier. In 1951 he passed matriculation examination, which in that year only a small percentage of student passed. He had no money so he worked while he attended University. In 1952, he had no money to pay for University and due to his family issues, he left his sister and brother with his relatives who lived in Kyauk Myaung, Yangon. Fortunately, the Army called for officers so he joined and attended OTS intake 8 in March 1952. Hla Myint (Win Oo), a very well-known singer/actor of that time who later came to visit Mawlamyaing when Chit Swe was head of South Eastern Commend, and he went to Pyin Oo Lwin with the head of CSM Saw Lwin. In 1981, he was head of North Eastern Command in Myanmar Army. In 1983, he was head of South Eastern Command and he was promoted to Brigadier General. Bureau of Special Operations In 1985, he was head of Bureau of Special Operations 2 in Myanmar Army, when there were only two BSO in Myanmar Army. Head of No. 1 BSO was Major General Sein Aung and on November 19, 1986 he was promoted to Major General. When he was head of BSO 2 he moved to Yangon from Mawlamyaing. In Yangon he lived in U Wi Sar Ya Road in front of Na Wa Rat Avenue. His major operations were Kayin State, Mon State, and Tanintharyi Division. In BSO he was also in charge of Than Taung in Kayin State. As BSO 2 his major enemies are KNU. His major function was to negotiate between the requirements of Regional Military Commands and Light Infantry Divisions in operations and √üKa Ka Kyi: √†. Headquarter. =Korean plane crash search= He got the order from headquarters to search for the commercial plane, Boeing 737, from Korea which crashed while flying from Bahrain to Bangkok in Myanmar. First he searched Dawei, Heain dar, Taung thone Lone, Myittar, Sin Phyu Dine because this is the route to Bangkok Airport, 100 miles distant from Dawei. The plane was not found so they searched again in extensively in the Myanmar Sea. The plane was not found in the sea either. So they predicted the plane would be the place where Andersen Ship was shipwrecked. =To Singapore and Thailand= While he was in BSO2, he went to Singapore and Thailand as a member of the Myanmar goodwill delegation, in which the leader was Maung Maung Kha, the prime minister, and other members were minister, U Ye Kaung, Major General Tint Swe, Colonel Maung Cho and minister for Foreign affairs and middle class in charges from Ministry of Foreign Affair. His duty was to observe for the future Myanmar Government Administration. He observed Setosa, business zone in downtown, urban architectures, dirty restaurants, market of animals, the port where unofficial cargo ships from Myanmar are boarded. At night, he attended an honor dinner by Singapore Government. At dinner was the president of Singapore, and an Indian man, Mr Chandayardast, member of Parliament. He saw Mr Chandayardast first at this dinner. His habit that was not very much known to public except his very close colleagues and staffs was that, he was a chain-smoker who quit smoking because his doctor asked him to choose between his health and cigarette while he went for check-up in Singapore, his favorite drink was Gin & Tonic, his usual talking behavior is to talk with his right index-finger pointing out (his right index-finger was broken when he played soccer during his younger days), he is a very shy person who rarely change clothes or even go with shorts in the public), his hair is well-swept anytime of the day and his love for conservation of Myanmar's forests (which is why whenever he is in cabinet, some of the generals who want to deforest the National reserved forests are the ones who always argues with him). =Failure of political system and birth of new era in Myanmar= While he was in BSO 2 there are 1988 uprising. In his autobiography, he mentioned about the uprising but he said his hatred and fear of war and hurting people is his nightmare. Minister On September 20, 1988 he was minister of three ministries, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Co-operatives and Ministry of Livestock and Fishery. On March 18, 1990 he was promoted to Lieutenant General. Later, he was Minister of Forestry until his retirement. Retirement He retired on July 23, 1997. The Korean government wanted to search again for commercial airline from Korea so they send a secretary from the Korean Embassy to him and Colonel Tha Win (Retired) to enquire and stated that they wanted to search using their ship. He advised them to contact the Ministry of Foreign affair. Later he wrote the book Tay Ta Nae Mwe Ta Nae with the pen name \\"Naung Sit Te\\", which means \\"old soldier\\". He finished writing his book on September 18, 2006. He now lives happily and peacefully with his family in his residence he'd lived since 1986.
