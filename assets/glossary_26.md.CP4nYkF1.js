The National Kaiser Wilhelm Monument (Kaiser-Wilhelm- Nationaldenkmal) was a memorial structure in Berlin dedicated to Wilhelm I, first Emperor of a unified Germany. It stood in front of the Stadtschloss from 1897 through 1950, when both structures were demolished by the GDR government. The monument was an equestrian statue of the first German Emperor Wilhelm I, on the Spree Canal along the Eosander portal on the west side of the Berlin City Palace. The design of the memorial was directly influenced by Wilhelm I's grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and the neo-baroque style of the memorial is the main work of sculptor Reinhold Begas, who had also designed the Victory Boulevard and the Bismarck National Memorial. The planned Monument to Freedom and Unity is to be located on the base originally constructed for the monument. Competitions and the intervention of the Emperor Final concept by Gustav Halmhuber. After the death of Wilhelm I in the Year of Three Emperors (1888) an open competition for the establishment of a central national monument to his memory was tendered the next year. The first competition, in which the architect Bruno Schmitz with the draft \\"Imperial Forum\\" was chosen,http://www.historisches- stadtschloss.de/cms/upload/pdf/05_Nationaldenkmal_KV.pdf did not bring the desired results. So in 1891 a second, limited bid to only eight selected artists was tendered. The location of the monument was laid down on the west side of the City Palace, along the Spree Canal. The design of Reinhold Begas and Gustav Halmhuber was eventually chosen. When it became known that the Emperor desired to have one of his favorite artists, Reinhold Begas, added to the list of the original eight artists invited to submit designs for the second competition, four of those artists withdrew. As might be expected, Begas won the competition and contracted sculptor Wilhelm von R√ºmann and his students to assist with creating the statues for his memorial design. The architectural part of the design was devised by the Stuttgart architect Gustav Halmhuber, who won the competition with his collaborator Begas, even against the design submitted by favored court architect Ernst von Ihne. In June 1894, construction began with the demolition of the houses that lined the street between the canal and Eosander Portal of the City Palace. On August 18, 1895, the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Gravelotte, the foundation stone for the memorial was laid. During the ten-day centennial celebrations held on the 100th anniversary of Wilhelm I birth, the monument was debuted on the late Emperor's birthday, 22 March 1897. The construction cost was four million marks, and represented a considerable sum when compared with the soon to be built Old Town Hall, which cost seven million marks to construct. Description of the memorial design The monument around 1900, in front of the Stadtschloss The central point of the monument was the equestrian statue of the Emperor, to the left accompanied by a female representation of Peace holding the reins of his horse. The orientation of the equestrian statue was directly facing the Eosander portal (Portal III), which was the main entrance of the City Palace. This followed a similar pattern of statues around the palace, such as the monument of the Great Elector on the Elector Bridge which was aligned to the palace's Portal I; and the monument to Wilhelm I's father, King Frederick William III in the Lustgarten, which was aligned with the palace's Portal IV. Around the equestrian statue's bronze pedestal, at the corners floated four Goddesses of Victory on balls. The front the pedestal bore the inscription \\"William the Great, German Emperor, King of Prussia 1861-1888\\" and on the back was the inscription \\"in gratitude and true love, the German people.\\" On the granite steps of the substructure on the north was a colossal statue of War and to the south one of Peace, created by Eugen Boermel. On the four projecting corners guarded four lion statues. From the north, the rear part of the monument was the Spree Canal. There is a still preserved today the jetty, which was used for barges on the canal. Except for some ventilation shafts are no other entrances from the jetty to the vault under-structure of the monument. The design was mockingly known by the nicknamed Wilhelm in the lions' den. This alluded to the compositional appeal of the central figure in a semicircle, which was similar to Briton Rivi√®re recent painting Daniel's Answer to the King. The entire memorial complex stood on a raised base of polished red granite from Sweden. This raised platform was nine steps up from the sidewalk and was suitable for national celebrations of all kinds.Architektenverein zu Berlin und Vereinigung Berliner Architekten [Herausgeber]: Berlin und seine Bauten, II. Band, Verlag Wilhelm Ernst & Sohn, Berlin 1896, pp. 36‚Äì38. The equestrian statue was enclosed on three sides facing away from the palace by a sandstone hall formed by coupled Ionic columns, which were enclosed at the ends by two corner pavilions. To emphasize the terraced rise of the square even more, the hall was increased in height by four meters. In the open and light design of the hall, only the corner pavilions were formed in a massive style. This allowed a good view on all sides of the equestrian statue and the palace beyond. The floor of the hall was covered by a sandstone mosaic floor. On the ledge of the front four groups of figures embodied the Kingdoms of Prussia (by Peter Breuer), Bavaria (by August Gaul), Saxony (by August Kraus) and W√ºrttemberg (by Peter Christian Breuer). The four groups on the back against the Spree represented trade and shipping (by Ludwig Cauer), art (by Hermann Hidding), science (by Karl Begas) and agriculture and industriousness (by Ludwig Cauer). The southern corner pavilion was crowned by the bronze quadriga of Bavaria, the work of Carl Hans Bernewitz. The counterpart on the northern corner pavilion, the four horse quadriga representing Borussia, created by John Goetz. History until removal Two remaining lions of the monument, placed at the Berlin Zoo. During the November Revolution of 1918, the monument was damaged in parts. During the early days of the Weimar Republic the government decided to restore the monument instead of removing it. The monument came through The Second World War relatively undamaged. In the winter of 1949/50, the GDR's ruling party, the SED decided to demolish the monument to its base. The demolition was politically motivated, as was the case a short time later with the decision to demolish the City Palace. The base still exists today on the southwestern edge of the castle square and is a listed building. The base floor is partially decorated with mosaics that are now protected under a layer of asphalt from the elements. In the underground vaults of the pedestal, street artists are known to leave their works, which can be visited at irregular intervals at one's own risk on descending a steep ladder into a revision shaft. From the actual monument, the four lions survived and now are on display outside the lion house at the Berlin Zoo. Furthermore, one remaining eagle statue by August Gaul is now owned by the Mark Brandenburg Museum.

It has operated since the 1960s as a binational cultural center. It annually offers about 250 events (speeches, exhibitions, workshops and readings) on transatlantic topics, at which those interested in societal exchange can engage in conversations with German and American experts and artists. In addition to offering concerts and English film series, the institute houses an American library with more than 20,000 titles as well as a student advisory service for German pupils interested in extended stays in the U.S. Carl- Schurz-Haus also organizes a diverse range of English courses, taught by native English speakers, for children, teenagers, and adults. Several organizations utilize Carl-Schurz-Haus as a meeting place, including the Freiburg-Madison-Gesellschaft, an association that supports relationships with Freiburg‚Äôs sister city Madison in the U.S.; the German American Business Community in Baden; a quilting club; the writing workshop Freiburg Writers‚Äô Group; and a square dancing club called Dreisam Swingers. At the end of 2016, members of the institute totaled about 1,660 people. Friederike Schulte has been the director of Carl-Schurz-Haus since 2010, while the chairman of the board is currently attorney-at-law Gerhard Manz.  History  On October 17, 1952 the Freiburg Amerika-Haus was founded at Goetheplatz 2 as the information center of the USIA (United States Information Agency). At the time, it also served as a branch office of the US-Consulate General in Stuttgart. Three years later, the center moved downtown to Bertoldstra√üe 8, but a change in building ownership forced the Amerika-Haus to relocate. After the 1964 plans to move the institute into the newly rebuilt Kornhaus fell through, the Amerika-Haus found its new location at Kaiser-Joseph-Stra√üe 266. The programming and administration departments moved into the new address in 1965, and in May 1966 a library and lecture hall were opened to the public. In response to budget cuts in the US government, Amerika-Haus was converted in 1962 to a binational institute in order to ensure its financial security. The US Information Agency, the Federal German Government, the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and the city of Freiburg all contributed financially to the conversion. The foundation Freiburger Amerika-Haus e. V. was subsequently established. A 1969 administrative decision changed its name to ‚ÄúCarl-Schurz- Haus/Deutsch-Amerikanisches Institut e. V.‚Äù, commemorating the 140th birthday of Carl Schurz, the German revolutionary, emigrant and 13th US Secretary of the Interior. The institution celebrated the name change in March 1969 with a ceremonial lecture about Carl Schurz, and an exhibition on his 150th birthday again recounted his eventful life. Financial problems arose in 1985 when the USIS budget cuts led to reduced monetary support. The German supporting groups filled the funding gap, which ensured the survival of the Carl-Schurz-Haus and established full German control of the institute. Since the founding of Freiburg and Madison, Wisconsin as sister cities in 1988, the institute has been the seat of the Freiburg-Madison-Gesellschaft. In 1993 the administration and executive board were merged and Eva Manske began to serve as director of the Carl-Schurz-Haus. The Amerika-Haus moved again in 2006 and reopened at its new location of Eisenbahnstra√üe 58‚Äì62. In October 2008, Christine Gerhardt became director, but accepted a position as professor of American studies at the University of Bayreuth two years later. American studies specialist Friederike Schulte took on leadership of the Carl-Schurz-Haus as the new director in 2010.  Library  The public American library in the Carl- Schurz-Haus offers more than 20,000 available items. The collection of books, eBooks, DVDs, audiobooks, 2 daily newspapers and over 50 magazines is available to library card holders. In addition, the library offers a computer workstation with internet access as well as an iPad for online research.  Advising  The Carl-Schurz-Haus is a EducationUSA advising center. EducationUSA centers are sponsored by the US Department of State and provide independent information on student exchange opportunities in the US. A variety of questions about curriculum organisation, student exchanges, language trips, Work & Travel and au pair arrangements are answered in one-on-one interviews and public lectures.  Special Events  Since the 2000 US Presidential Election, the Carl-Schurz-Haus has organized a Freiburg Election Night Party every four years with the Landeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung (Regional Center for Political Education) and other partners. With live broadcasts, short talks and commentaries as well as entertainment programs and food, this is the largest and most visited event of its type in southwestern Germany. Since 2001, the Carl-Schurz-Haus and numerous partner institutes have hosted an annual Independence Day Party in the beer garden of the Ganter Brewery, an event that is often visited by the Consulate General of the United States in Frankfurt.  Language Classes  Since 1975, the institute has organized English language classes which are exclusively taught by native English speakers. The spectrum of classes offered today range from classic conversation courses to individual and corporate courses, the administration of tests and certifications, and courses in intercultural skills. In the fall of 2000, a course program designed specifically for children and teenagers was added in order to supplement students‚Äô school English lessons. Since 2006, Academies with this same focus have taken place three times each year; these holiday camps offer intensive language courses through experiential learning for school-age children. Mayor Dieter Salomon sponsored the newly-established Green Academy in 2014, which combined language acquisition with environmental awareness. Since the 60th anniversary of the institute in 2012, teenagers can participate in the English-speaking book club The Book Stars to engage in discussions about current literature. The Inside America program at Carl- Schurz-Haus connects schools in the region with native English speakers and students from the U.S. in order to facilitate authentic intercultural encounters. This program enables German students and Americans to actively interact with each other through classroom visits.  Select Events  * 1968 Leslie A.

The Shirazi sub-division claim themselves to be superior to the other gots on account of their alleged descent from Iranian immigrants. Historically, the Mochi practiced clan exogamy, but this is no longer the case, with marriages taking place with close kin. Below is a list of the other major gots:A Glossary of the Tribes and Castes of Punjab and the North West Frontier Province Volume III by H A Rose *Ballu *Bhangar *Bero *Biswan *Jabbar *Jakhar *Jhalli *Summan * Toor *Khillar *Mahman *Rattanpal The Mochi in rural Punjab is still dependent on the local landlord, who acts as patron. Often, the Mochi does not own his property, but rents from the landlord. The Mochi is thus entirely dependent on the locally dominant caste, and are paid from each cash crop at the end of the harvesting season according to a system called seypi. Justice in Practice Legal Ethnography of a Punjab Village by Muhammad Azam Chuadhary Oxford University Press 1999 Presently, many Mochis are no longer involved in their traditional occupation of shoemaking. Many are now landless agricultural labourers. Overall, the condition of the Mochi community in Punjab has worsened. There has been a marked shift towards manufactured shoes, which has seen a severe decline in their traditional occupation. Many of their patrons from the locally dominant castes such as the Jats no longer pay the traditional seypi. Unlike in India, the Government of Pakistan has not provided any affirmative actions programmes. As such, the Mochi are one of the most vulnerable ethnic community in Pakistan, and are often victims of societal discrimination. The Mochi are entirely Sunni and speak Punjabi.

He was executed in London after being found guilty of treason. Early life Hacket was born at Oundle, Northamptonshire; he had no formal education and was illiterate,Worth, Roland H. Messiahs and messianic movements through 1899 (McFarland, 2005) pp. 123‚Äì5. finding work as a serving- man in the households of a Mr. Hussey, Sir Thomas Tresham, and Sir Charles Morrison, all Northamptonshire gentry. He married the widow of a well-to-do farmer named Moreton, and became a maltster. He had a reputation for riotous living, and something of his violent nature can be ascertained by a story that during a quarrel in an alehouse with a schoolmaster called Freckingham, he bit off and ate his opponent's nose. Conversion and preaching At some stage Hacket seemed to abandon his former dissolute ways and underwent some kind of religious conversion; an acquaintance in Oundle, Giles Wigginton, became his disciple. Travelling to York, Hacket announced that he was sent there by God to prepare the way for the Messiah, only to be \\"well whipped\\" and banished from the city; he got a similar reception in Leicester. Subsequently, he preached around the villages of Northamptonshire against Queen Elizabeth and her chief councillors, for which he was arrested and thrown in Northampton gaol. He was released after many weeks' imprisonment, on giving a bond to come up for judgment when called upon. London and treason Around Easter 1591, Hacket travelled to London at Wigginton's suggestion, staying at a lodging house outside Smithfield. Wigginton introduced him to Edmund Coppinger, who held a minor post in the royal household, and had declared that he had been moved by God to warn the queen to reform herself, her family, the commonwealth, and church. Coppinger soon convinced himself and a friend, Henry Arthington, a Yorkshire gentleman, that Hacket had an \\"extraordinary calling\\", and had in fact come from heaven, after anointment by the Holy Ghost, to inaugurate a new era on earth. Hacket also claimed some kind of invulnerability. People came to his lodgings to hear his prayers, prophecies and \\"ohes, loud sighes and groninges\\"; member of Parliament Job Throckmorton compared his utterings to a \\"wildgoose chase\\" with \\"neither head nor foote, rime nor reason\\".Kemal, Salim. Performance and authenticity in the arts (Cambridge University Press, 1999) p. 53. Coppinger, his \\"prophet of mercy\\" and Arthington, \\"prophet of judgement\\", proved credulous disciples. They talked of dethroning the Queen and putting Hacket in her place, of abolishing the episcopacy, and of establishing in every congregation an 'eldership' or consistory of doctor, pastor, and lay elders. Christopher Hatton, the Lord- chancellor, and other ministers of state were to be removed from office, and replaced by associates of the conspirators, among whom were mentioned William Davison and other persons of note, reputed to be of puritan predilections. They scattered letters about London foretelling the coming changes. Hacket defaced the queen's arms which were set up in his lodgings in Knightrider Street, and mutilated a picture of her with a bodkin. On 19 July 1591, Coppinger and Arthington went from Hacket's lodgings near \\"Broken wharf\\" to Cheapside, and from the top of an empty cart preached that William Hacket was the Christ returned to judge the earth and establish the gospel in Europe, and that repentance would ensure mercy from heaven; they were his two prophets, sent by God as witnesses. Terrible judgement and eternal punishment was promised against those who would not believe and repent. They also spoke out against the Queen and her ministers.Besant, Walter. London in the time of the Tudors (London: A. & C. Black, 1904) pp. 158‚Äì9. Crowds gathered, and a riot ensued, forcing the fanatics to take refuge in the Mermaid Tavern. The privy council, on hearing of their conduct, had them and Hacket arrested, and they were imprisoned in Bridewell Palace. Trial and execution Hacket was brought to trial for treason on 26 July at the Sessions House near Newgate. He pleaded guilty to a charge of declaring that Queen Elizabeth was not queen of England, but pleaded not guilty to a second charge that he had defaced the queen's picture. His behaviour at and after the trial suggests that, by this time, he was not of sound mind. He was condemned to death, and executed near the Cross in Cheapside on 28 July 1591 by being hanged, drawn and quartered. On the way to the scaffold he is said to have insulted the clergyman accompanying him and uttered \\"execrable blasphemy\\" to the last. Of his fellow conspirators, Coppinger starved himself to death in Bridewell, though Arthington, claiming that he had been the victim of witchcraft, and after a penitent apology, was released in the following year. A Life, Arraignment, Judgement, and Execution of William Hacket was licensed for publication to Robert Bourne on 28 July 1591. No copy seems to have survived. John Strype gave a summary of a Conspiracy for pretended Reformation, (1592), which details Hacket, Coppinger, and Arthington's activities.Strype, John. Annals of the Reformation, vol. 4 (Oxford, 1824) pp. 95‚Äì100, nos. XLVIII & XLIX.

English Renaissance scenes: from canon to margins (Peter Lang, 2008) pp. 86‚Äì7. Although Hacket and his followers did excite some public interest there was no corresponding popular support for his views ‚Äì in fact, quite the opposite. Also, at the time, Puritan leaders were being tried for sedition and imprisoned; enemies attempted to use the Puritan affiliation of the Hacket rebels as the basis for a link with Thomas Cartwright and the wider Puritan faction, and undermine its influence. However, there was never any evidence to suggest foreknowledge, and in fact, Cartwright had considered the insurrectionists to be deluded and disordered in mind, to be treated as such, and had suggested imprisonment as the correct course of action. In 1596, Cartwright, having already incurred the Government's displeasure, and been imprisoned for another matter, issued a written defence of his actions in answer to scurrilous accusations concerning the Hacket rebellion.Brook, B.

Life and work Oestreicher's home in Meiningen until 1938 In 1938, shortly after he began school, his family had to leave their home in Germany due to the Jewish ancestry of his father, the paediatrician Paul Oestreicher (1896‚Äì1981). They found asylum in New Zealand in 1939, where he grew up. He studied Political Science and German Literature at the University of Otago and the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand from 1949‚Äì1955, completing an MA with a thesis on the history of conscientious objection to WWII in New Zealand (1955). Whilst he was at the University of Otago he was editor of its student newspaper, Critic. He then moved to the University of Bonn for a two-year Alexander von Humboldt research fellowship to study Christianity and Marxism under professor Helmut Gollwitzer. Between 1956 and 1958 he trained as an Anglican Priest at Lincoln Theological College, before spending 1958 and 1959 as assistant guest pastor to the German Protestant Church in R«ñsselsheim in the church province of Hessen-Nassau, at the invitation of Church President Martin Niem√∂ller. In 1959 he was ordained deacon in St Paul's Cathedral London and priest a year later. He served as curate in the parish of Holy Trinity Church, Dalston in east London, where he was trained by vicar Stanley Evans, a founding member of the Christian Socialist Movement, now Christians on the Left. From 1961 to 1964 he was a Features Producer in the BBC religious broadcasting department, winning an American Radio Award for a programme on abortion. Paul Oestreicher, Marx and Engels, and Berlin Cathedral From 1964 to 1969 was the Secretary of the East-West Relations Advisory Committee of the British Council of Churches, continuing this role in an honorary capacity until 1985. He took an active part early on in the Christian Peace Conference (Prague) and in 1964 was elected to its executive committee. On account of his critique of Soviet policies he was expelled from the Executive in 1968. He said his 'parish' stretched from East Berlin to Vladivostok, and he paid 77 pastoral visits to East Germany before the fall of the Berlin Wall. He was a member of the General Synod of the Church of England from 1970‚Äì81 and 1995‚Äì97.https://www.churchofengland.org/about-us/structure/general- synod/agendas-and-papers.aspx From 1968 to 1981 he was appointed the parish priest of the Church of the Ascension, Blackheath by John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich). During this time He appointed Deaconess Elsie Baker to lead the pastoral work of the parish, well ahead of the ordination of women to the priesthood. The Church of England eventually ordained her in her 85th year. Oestreicher was a founding member of the Movement for the Ordination of Women. In 1974 in his personal capacity, he was invited by the West German Minister of Justice, and the families of the prisoners, to help bring to an end a long- lasting hunger strike by the imprisoned members of the Red Army Faction, which had led to deaths inside and, in retaliation, outside the prison system. This entailed mediating between Attorney-General Siegfried Buback and the prisoners. Although partially successful, this mission did not prevent the subsequent deaths of the leading RAF prisoners. Oestreicher attending a protest against the bombing of Libya, 1986 From 1981 to 1985 he was Director of the Division of International Affairs of the British Council of Churches. As part of this work, in cooperation with the South African Council of Churches, he was actively involved in the Anti-Apartheid Movement. Later, at the invitation of Desmond Tutu, he helped to bring an end to the armed conflict between the African National Congress and Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. During this period he became a member of the Society of Friends. He made a substantial contribution to the work of the Dresden Trust, which raised funds in the UK for the reconstruction of the Frauenkirche in Dresden. In 1985 the Diocesan Synod elected Oestreicher Bishop of Wellington, New Zealand. The Anglican Church leadership declined to ratify this election. Oestreicher travelling to 50th Anniversary of Dresden bombing From 1985‚Äì1997, Oestreicher was Canon Residentiary and Director of the International Centre for Reconciliation at Coventry Cathedral UK. This enabled him to further the work of the Community of the Cross of Nails. After his retirement, he continued to work in an advisory role with his successor Andrew White (priest). In 1993, he spent a sabbatical year as Humboldt Fellow at the Free University of Berlin, studying Church-state relations in East Germany. He retired from the cathedral in 1998, remaining Canon Emeritus and moving to Brighton, where he lives with his second wife, the New Zealander Barbara Einhorn, a professor of Gender Studies at the University of Sussex. They married in 2002, having first met after Oestreicher helped get Einhorn released from arrest and imprisonment by the Stasi for befriending a women's dissident peace group. In 2010, Einhorn and Oestreicher both taught for one semester at the National Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies, University of Otago, of which they are still Research Affiliates. He and Einhorn are amongst the founding members of Jews for Justice for Palestinians. From 2004 to 2009 Oestreicher was honorary Quaker chaplain to the University of Sussex. In 2011, Oestreicher held the keynote speech on the abolition of war at the World Council of Churches International Ecumenical Peace Convocation (IEPC) in Kingston, Jamaica. A lifelong pacifist, Oestreicher was co-founder of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship in New Zealand, and remains a Counsellor of APF UK. In 1959 he joined the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and is still one of its Vice-Presidents. He joined Amnesty International at its inception in 1961 and was Chair of AI UK from 1975 to 1979.

At the one hand work‚Äìlife balance (WLB) is seen as a popular, but also imprecise term that covers from a scientific perspective, not a single phenomenon, but rather an entire subject area.SpringerLink - Abstract In the focus of this subject area, stand aspects of the relationship and interplay between work and private life. In this connection the work component refers to the paid work and the life component to the other areas of life such as family, friendships, social and cultural commitment, health behavior, and other things. Similarly is a further definition, in which the WLB is depicted as two scales, one for the life component and the other for the work component, which should be balanced. In the shell, which stands for life, hobbies, sports, travel, cultural interests, society, friends and family were put inside. In the shell, which stands for work is the job that is a serious block opposed to the more pleasurable experiences.Informationsgesellschaft Thus working gets back the negative meaning which the linguists attributed the term in its origins. But also outside of the family, needs and responsibilities are waiting to be fulfilled,Barnett, Rosalind C. (1998): Towards a Review and Reconceptualization of the Work/Family Literature.

Experiences from Germany (=WWS Series 6). Seattle: WWS Worldwide. www.wwsworldwide.com Discussion in Germany More and more companies are thinking seriously about WLB concepts. After all, a non-existing balance between work and private life has negative consequences. These consequences include, for example lower job performance, higher absenteeism, more mistakes and incorrect decisions, worse working atmosphere, depending on labor market situation more willingness of resignation, abdication of image benefits at the market and internal escape.De Graat, Elena (2007): Kennzahlen und Kosten- Nutzen-Relation zur Bewertung familienfreundlicher Ma√ünahmen in Unternehmen.

P. 231-242 A chief motive of companies is to maintain and, if possible, increase the competitiveness of products and services and thus achieving the best overall business results. To achieve this result, enterprises need the appropriate employees. Since the talent of employees is seen as a competitive differentiation attribute in good, but also in bad economic times, companies need to think more creatively and strategically than ever before about how they can use WLB programs to their advantage.Leopold, Ronald S. (2009): Competitive Value of Employee Benefits. In: Financial Executive. October 2009 p. 56-57 Work‚Äìlife balance and demographic change in Germany The topic of the WLB is in times of demographic change, especially topical, as the demographic changes lead to a drastic decline in the labor force potential. Unless there is a significant migration of workers, what can not be considered under the current immigration policy as likely,Rost, Harald (2007): Im Zeichen der Demographie: Potenziale nutzen ‚Äì Wettbewerbsvorteile sichern. In: Esslinger, Adelheid Susanne/Schobert, Deniz B. (2007): Erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Work‚Äìlife Balance in Organisationen - Strategien, Konzepte, Ma√ünahmen. 1st ed. Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag. P. 45-59 the number of employed persons will be reduced from currently about 42 million to 25 to 35 million. This means, that in the long term the already, partial existing deficit of qualified specialists and executives will increase dramatically, and increasingly fewer and fewer labor force is available. The need for well- qualified staff will continue to grow. Even if it is currently, with about 4.5 million unemployed people in Germany hardly to imagine, a shortage of skilled workers will already be most likely in the medium term. In addition, the birth rate in Germany is for over three decades at a low level, so that the long- term population size can not be kept constant and thus a decline in population is almost inevitable. This leads to significant consequences in the social development. The population would shrink, depending on the model, in Germany in 2050 to about 67-75 million people.Statistisches Bundesamt (2003): Bev√∂lkerung Deutschlands bis 2050 ‚Äì 10. Koordinierte Bev√∂lkerungsvorausrechnung. Wiesbaden These demographic changes will also lead to drastic effects on the structure and scope of employment potential, because in general the labor supply will decrease in future, while the average age of workers increases considerable. The economically active population aged 15 to 64 years will decrease by these projections, relatively and absolutely, more numerical than the total population. It follows that the demographic development also leads to an aging of the total society. Since not only the average age of the workforce is increasing, but at the same time barely enough young people move up, this demographic development will affect the labor market and the human resources policy in enterprises sustainable.Fl√ºter- Hoffmann, Christiane (2007): Die Bedeutung innovativer Personalmanagementkonzepte f√ºr Betriebe und die Gesamtwirtschaft.

P. 61-80 The Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) has calculated that the decline in the supply of specialists and executives in 2015 will already be noticeable and in 2025 led to a gap of about 350,000 persons.

Therefore, it is extremely important for companies, being an attractive employer in order to hire the decreasing number of young specialists and executives and obligate them to the company. Combination work‚Äìlife balance and family In particular, young, highly skilled workers want to have more and more often a career without waiving for children. The high level of childlessness by female academics, for example, is in most cases not voluntarily, but mostly structural. When companies adapt to the new needs of the compatibility of family and work and thus are considered as \\"family friendly\\" company, it can be assumed that this acts as an incentive system to the qualified staff and that family-friendliness in companies is increasingly seen as a locational advantage. In Germany it is the responsibility of the state and required by law to provide child care places. Unfortunately, the experiences of the past show that the family-policy benefits of the state are not enough to solve the problem of reconciling work and family satisfactorily. The unions have argued for a long time that company childcare facilities favor the private dependency of the employee to the employer.Erler, Giesela Anna (2005) Stille Revolution ‚Äì oder Etikettenschwindel? In: Zeitschrift f√ºr Familienforschung Sonderheft 5, p.154 At this point, the initiative of the economy is required, to take a supporting role and particular responsibility. Only then can we succeed in enabling young people a work‚Äìlife balance, which authorizes them to exercise both their profession, as well as the desire for a family, which most couples still have as a life goal. As yet some female employees decide to have children, the following can be observed in the employment rate: while at the beginning of the working life the employment rate is still the same between men and women, the employment rate of women drops significantly in the family phase between 25‚Äì40 years. Many well- qualified mothers can not work, because of inadequate child care, or work only part-time. Here is considerable potential for employment of almost 3.3 million women who are not at all or are only (unwittingly) part-time employed.Fl√ºter- Hoffmann, Christiane (2007): Die Bedeutung innovativer Personalmanagementkonzepte f√ºr Betriebe und die Gesamtwirtschaft. In: Esslinger, Adelheid Susanne/ Schobert, Deniz B. (2007): Erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Work-Life Balance in Organisationen ‚Äì Strategien, Konzepte, Ma√ünahmen. 1st ed. Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag. p. 61-80 70% of mothers who are at home would be better employed and one of three father wants to have more time for his family.p. 35-43 Hence the positions of women or men who are forced, by lack of childcare, to get out for some time from work, need to be filled, substantial costs occur here for the company. As part of the national competition \\"The family-friendly company 2000: New Opportunities for Women and Men\\" the CEO of a company announced that the amount of costs for filling a vacant position belongs to about 75% to 150% of the respectively annual salary. Would a cost-benefit analysis be prepared, whether the assistance in the field of child care would be worth as WLB measure, in this analysis the know-how loss necessarily should be included, which is connected to a long career break.De Graat, Elena (2007): Kennzahlen und Kosten-Nutzen_Relation zur Bewertungfamilienfreundlicher Ma√ünahmen in Unternehmen. In: Esslinger, Adelheid Susanne/ Schobert, Deniz B. (2007): Erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Work‚Äìlife Balance in Organisationen ‚Äì Strategien, Konzepte, Ma√ünahmen. 1st ed. Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag. p. 231-242 However, the complex of problems should not only be discussed in the reconciliation of family and work in terms of child care. In this case it is often thought of young people who have to combine their professional needs with the care and education of children, but the support of aid needed and high-maintenance people is included here only rarely. This ignores that 68% of the over two million care- needed people in Germany live in their own homes and were supported partly or entirely by family members and other members of the private network. Overall, about 92% of the high-maintenance and about 85% of the help needed people are usually cared by family members.Bundesministerium f√ºr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend (2005): F√ºnfter Bericht zur Lage der √§lteren Generation in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland ‚Äì Potenziale des Alters in Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft. Der Beitrag √§lterer Menschen zum Zusammenhalt der Generationen. Bericht der Sachverst√§ndigenkommission, Berlin From the changing age structure of society which is motivated by the demographic change, necessarily results an increase of people who need help and care services. Because the support and maintenance of the old generation is often done by the middle generation, this means up to today a considerable relief for the society and its social systems and therefore for the economy. With that not only the financial contribution of the labor force for the maintenance of the no longer in working life standing, in the society so-called \\"generation contract\\", is meant. Most notably it deals with the work performance, which is applied individually within the families, to care for sick, help- and care-needed elderly people.Kaiser, Heinz J√ºrgen (2007): Work‚Äìlife Balance aus Sicht der Gerontologie. In: Esslinger, Adelheid Susanne/ Schobert, Deniz B. (2007): Erfolgreiche Umsetzung von Work‚Äìlife Balance in Organisationen ‚Äì Strategien, Konzepte, Ma√ünahmen. 1st ed. Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag. p. 97-121 According to the Federal Ministry for Senior Citizens, Women and Youth, at least 45% of people who provide care services in their family have to reconcile this activity with the requirements of their employment,Bundesministerium f√ºr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend (2000): Vereinbarkeit von Erwerbst√§tigkeit und Pflege ‚Äì Betriebliche Ma√ünahmen zur Unterst√ºtzung pflegender Angeh√∂riger. Ein Praxisleitfaden, Berlin which can lead to a substantial limitation of the WLB. Since the task of maintenance today is still predominantly performed by women, their potential of skills and knowledge can not always benefit the economy, due to the family responsibilities. Approximately 19% of all Germans are currently more than 65 years old. In 2050, almost one of three people will be older than 65. The age group of 0 - to 19-year-old now makes about 21% of the total population; in 2050 the share will be decreased to only 15%. Based on these figures this will lead for significantly more families than before, to higher, if not double compatibility difficulties. Especially the family members in the middle age, the so-called \\"sandwich generation\\", has to manage increasingly both, the task of education and care of the children, and support services related to the maintenance and care of older people. Motives of companies to integrate work‚Äìlife balance measures The demographic development is forcing every company to maintain and improve the employability of employees. Moreover, companies must acquire new qualified employees and keep the skills of employees up to date through lifelong learning.Buck, Hartmut/Weidenh√∂fer, J√∂rg (2006): Betriebliche Personalpolitik - Demographische Herausforderungen bewerten und annehmen. In: Prager, Jens U./Schleiter, Andr√© (Hrsg.): L√§nger leben, arbeiten und sich engagieren. Chancen werteschaffender Besch√§ftigung bis ins Alter. G√ºtersloh, p. 103-116 If companies support their employees in creating a WLB, the company can generate an economic benefit from it permanently. To this economic benefit counts in particular the reduction of stress levels of the employees, reducing absenteeism and sickness absence rate, the reduction of the fluctuation with the effects of human capital preservation, increasing employee loyalty and commitment to the company, increasing motivation and satisfaction of the workforce, increasing the return rate and reducing the period of absence after maternity and elderly care, reducing the effort needed to reoccupation, an improved recruitment marketing, performance improvement, marketing effects for product sales and an improved corporate image. Thus, companies can generate long-term competitive advantages, which is a major motive of WLB.Schobert 2007, p. 26 Another motive for a family-friendly and WLB integrated personnel policy is to increase the job satisfaction of employees in order to achieve a higher overall productivity.Fl√ºter-Hoffmann, Christiane/Solbrig, J√∂rn (2003): Wie familienfreundlich ist die deutsche Wirtschaft? In: IW-Trends, viertelj√§hrliche Zeitschrift zur empirischen Wirtschaftsforschung, 30(4). p. 37-46 In addition, the personnel policy is seen as a competitive factor in attracting and retaining qualified staff. But also the cost savings through lower absenteeism and lower fluctuation are of course motives of companies to support the WLB of their employees. Benefits of companies which support work‚Äìlife balance measures Through the implementation of appropriate human resource management concepts, the permanent generation of economic benefits for the organization is reachable, which expresses itself for example through cost-saving potentials, such as reducing the effort needed for reoccupation, reducing absenteeism and sickness absence rate,Bundesministerium f√ºr Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend (2003): Betriebswirtschaftliche Effekte familienfreundlicher Ma√ünahmen, Kosten-Nutzen-Analyse.

Basel or through marketing effects for the sale of products. Thus, the companies ensure their competitiveness and take social responsibility. Thereby short-term and long-term effects were shown, which lead to an overall generation of competitive advantages and support sustainable social changes.

He was a member of the Reading Swimming Club where he was also a part-time lifeguard and coached the Cygnets, Reading's club for swimmers with learning difficulties. Accident In October 2000 Edmunds was knocked off his motorcycle whilst riding to work on the A4. His injuries were so severe that doctors considered amputating both of his legs and believed that he would never walk again. He spent three months with his legs in casts before beginning swimming again as part of his physiotherapy routine. Because he had limited movement in his ankle joints he qualified as a disabled swimmer in the S10 category. When Edmunds met the British Paralympic coach Billy Pye he decided to begin training for the 2004 Summer Paralympics, but had to move to Swansea to make use of the High Performance Training Centre as Reading had no Olympic-size swimming pool. Paralympics Edmunds made his first appearance at the Paralympics in 2004. He competed in two individual S10 classification freestyle events as well as the 4√ó100 m freestyle 34 pts relay team. In the individual 100 m he was knocked out in the heats but he made the final of the 50 m finishing in sixth. The relay team, which also featured David Roberts, Robert Welbourn and Matt Walker, set a new world record time of 3 59.62 seconds to win the gold medal ahead of Australia on the day of Edmunds 30th birthday. In 2008 Edmunds won a silver medal and set a new British record in the S10 50 m freestyle at the British Swimming Championships. He made his second Paralympic appearance for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Paralympics, held in Beijing, China. Edmunds raced in the same three events as in 2004 as well as the 4√ó100 m medley 34 pts relay team. he made the finals of both his individual events but failed to win a medal, finishing seventh in the 100 m and eighth in the 50 m. In the medley the Great Britain team made the final but finished fifth, 17 seconds behind the new world record time set by gold medallists Australia. The freestyle relay quartet of Edmunds, Roberts, Walker and Welbourn successfully defended the title they had won in Athens setting a new world record of 3 minutes 51.43 seconds en route to winning gold. At the 2009 IPC Swimming European Championships in Reykjav√≠k, Edmunds won an individual bronze medal in the men's S10 50 m freestyle and a gold medal in the 34 point 4x100 m freestyle competing with Walker, Welbourn and Jonathan Fox. In 2010 Edmunds was appointed to UK Anti-Doping's newly formed Athlete's Committee along with fellow Paralympian Helene Raynsford. In 2013 he was reappointed to the Athletes Committee of UK Anti-Doping for a further three years. In May 2012 it was announced that Edmunds had been selected as part of the ParalympicGB to compete at London 2012. http://www.swimming.org/britishswimming/news/disability- swimming/paralympicsgb-nominees-confirmed-for-london-2012/13764/ Post Swimming Following on from the London 2012 Paralmpic Games, Edmunds announced that he was retiring from competitive swimming.

It was introduced in the 2009/2010 Budget Speech in parliament by Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta. Its aim was to jumpstart the Kenyan economy towards long term growth and development, after the 2007/2008 post election violence that affected the Kenyan economy. Other economic problems included prolonged drought, a rally in oil prices and food prices, and the effects of the 2008/09 global economic crisis. The stimulus was a response to the decline in the economic growth rate from 7.1% in 2007 to 1.7% in 2009. The total budget allocated amounted to 22 Billion Kenya Shillings (260 million US$), with the money going towards the construction of schools, horticultural markets, jua kali sheds and public health centres in all the 210 constituencies. Key Objectives 1. Boost the country's economic recovery; 2. Invest in long term solutions to the challenges of food security 3. Expand economic opportunities in rural areas for employment creation; 4. Promote regional development for equity and social stability; 5. Improve infrastructure and the quality education and healthcare; 6. Invest in the conservation of the environment; 7. Expand the access to, and build the ICT capacity to expand economic opportunities and accelerate economic growth.  Intervention Measures  The choice of intervention measures of the ESP are framed within broader policy objectives, as stipulated in the Vision 2030, (the current national development blue-print.

It is built in the Gothic Revival style. Background Whilst limited evidence exists of church activity round Benton from the 7th and 8th centuries, it is from the mid-12th century that the existence of the parish of Long Benton can be assured, as the church can name its rectors from 1150 to the present day. Dr G. W. D. Briggs, in his publication 'St. Bartholomew's Church', states that 'there is a reference to transfer of the advowson by Roger de Merlay dated 1251 and then of the foundation of a chantry in honour of the Virgin Mary by 'Adam of Benton' dated 23 December 1310. This foundation names the church of St Andrew in Benton.' In 1339/1340, the church was transferred to the patronage of Balliol College Oxford which still holds it. By 1790, the church had fallen into great disrepair, and had reached a stage where rebuilding was the only remaining option. The architect employed was William Newton, who designed and built the nave and tower over the foundations of the original church. Dr Besly, vicar of the parish from 1830 writes 'the chancel, which was then the responsibility of Balliol College, was left in its original state in consequence of the disinclination of the lessees of the great tithes to undertake the expense of rebuilding it,' and the church was dedicated in honour of Saint Bartholomew and was consecrated by the Bishop of Peterborough, the Right Reverend Dr John Hinchcliffe on 2 November 1791. The chancel was rebuilt in 1855, with an organ chamber and south aisle being added in 1874. The vestry was added in 1888 and the date of the porch is uncertain. The new, octagonal Church Hall was built in 1980, replacing an earlier parish hall on the other side of Station Road, which had opened in 1925. In 1994, a new chapel, parish office and library were dedicated by the Bishop of Newcastle. These new facilities have provided a basis for the Church's Parish activities, including the production of publications, such as the Parish magazine 'In Touch'. Services The Church still maintains daily Morning and Evening Prayer, with a mid-week Eucharist on a Wednesday. On a Sunday there are three services, with the main 'Parish Eucharist' at 10.00 am. The beautiful surroundings and traditional interior have made it a popular venue for weddings. Music The church choir continues to attract musicians from a variety of age groups and musical heritage, meeting weekly for rehearsals, and singing at the Parish Eucharist once a week. The choir maintain a rich musical tradition, performing a both historical and modern music. They dress in traditional cassock and surplice. The original organ was built by Nicholson and Son in 1874, and was rebuilt by J.J. Binns, Fitton & Haley. A description of its faculties can be found on The National Pipe Organ Register. This instrument was removed and replaced by a Copeman Hart digital instrument with sixty-one speaking stops built into a four-manual console in early 2014. To mark the centenary of the rebuilding of the church, a peal of eight bells was installed, which are used before services and weddings.

He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1914, during the Great War, and fought on the Western Front. In the Second World War he was commander of the 1st Airlanding Brigade, of the 1st Airborne Division. He commanded the brigade in the Mediterranean theatre during Operation Ladbroke, part of the Allied invasion of Sicily, in July 1943, as well as during the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden, in September 1944. After the Second World War he retired from the British Army and worked for the International Refugee Organization and the National Playing Fields Association before his death in 1967. Early life Hicks was born on 25 September 1895 in Warwick, Warwickshire. The son of Dr Philip Hicks and the writer Beatrice Whitby, he was educated at Winchester College in Hampshire. First World War Hicks was a member of the Territorial Force army number 15075, and was commissioned a 2nd lieutenant into the 1/7th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, on 23 October 1914. The 1/7th Battalion was serving with the 1/5th, 1/6th and 1/8th battalions as part of the 143rd (1/1st Warwickshire) Brigade, part of the 48th (South Midland) Division, which took part in the battle of the Somme in 1916 and the third Battle of Ypres in 1917. Hicks was granted a regular army commission on 23 June 1916. Hicks was mentioned in despatches on 13 November 1916, while serving with the 7th Battalion. In May 1918, Hicks transferred to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, which was part of the 10th Brigade of the 4th Division. While serving with the 4th Division he was awarded a Military Cross in 1918, during the Hundred Days Offensive in the final months of the war. The citation stated: \\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty during a daylight raid. He commanded his party in a most skilful manner, and was largely responsible for its success. About 50 of the enemy were killed, several of whom were shot by him with his revolver, and two prisoners taken. His conduct was splendid.\\" On 8 November 1918 Hicks was again mentioned in despatches. Between the wars Hicks remained in the Army after the First World War, and was promoted to captain in January 1922. He served in British India between November 1924 and January 1926. The following year, on 19 November 1927, he married Patty Fanshaw, the daughter of Brigadier Lionel Arthur Fanshawe. They had two children, a son and a daughter. In November 1924 Hicks became the aide de camp to the district commander at Karachi until January 1926. In March 1931, he returned to the Royal Warwickshire Regiment, joining the 2nd Battalion at Khartoum. His next appointment was as the Staff captain to the Guernsey and Alderney district between April 1933 and March 1936, when he was promoted to major. In January 1937 Hicks returned to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, which was now back in the United Kingdom and based at Tidworth Camp. He remained with the 2nd Battalion until January 1939, when he transferred again to the 1st Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, which was serving in Faizabad at the time. Second World War At the start of the Second World War, Hicks was still a major, but was promoted to acting lieutenant-colonel in May 1940, commander of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment, which, from February 1940 was serving in the 144th Brigade of the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. The battalion played a prominent part in the Battle of Dunkirk, part of the Battle of France, for which Hicks was awarded a Distinguished Service Order. In 1942, Hicks was given command of an airborne formation, the 1st Airlanding Brigade, part of the 1st Airborne Division, and in 1943 was promoted to brigadier. During Operation Ladbroke ‚Äì part of the Allied invasion of Sicily ‚Äì Hicks's glider landed in the sea offshore. Hicks and the other men on board decided to swim ashore. Once there he gathered a force together and prepared to attack a coastal artillery battery. For his actions in Sicily Hicks was awarded a second Distinguished Service Order. The citation stated: \\"Brigadier Hicks commanded and led the 1st Airlanding Brigade in its moonlight attack at Syracuse on the night 9‚Äì10 July 1943. His own glider landed in the sea. He and his party swam ashore and took part in the fighting against enemy coast defences. Throughout the entire operation Brigadier Hicks showed the highest qualities of leadership, courage and devotion to duty.\\" During the Battle of Arnhem, part of Operation Market Garden, on the night of 17‚Äì18 September, the commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Roy Urquhart, was reported missing and Brigadier Hicks assumed command of the 1st Airborne Division during a crucial period.Tugwell, p.258 After the battle was over, Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery wrote in a letter to the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, that \\"There is no doubt Hicks did extremely well at Arnhem, but there is also no doubt that it has been too much for him and he is not now fit to fight again in battle in this war\\". Montgomery went on to recommend that Hicks be considered for command of an area in England or overseas. On 23 March 1945, he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Later life In May 1948 Hicks retired from the army and became a regional commissioner for the International Refugee Organization in Germany between 1948 and 1952. He followed this by being on the board of the National Playing Fields Association in London, between 1955 and 1961. Hicks died on 8 October 1967 at Hartley Wintney in Hampshire.

He is a regularly featured speaker and writer in South African and international media. He has addressed many prominent organisations,http://www.africaheritage.com/Louw.pdf including the US Congress hearings on apartheid, the King Center for Nonviolent Social Change, the Hoover Institute and the United Nations.http://www.whoswhosa.co.za/leon-louw-3162 Early life Leon Louw was born in the town of Krugersdorp on 18 March 1948 to a conservative Afrikaner family. After his mother died in his infancy, he was raised by relatives in Potchefstroom, where he attended preschool and started primary school. When his father remarried, he was moved to the new family home in Johannesburg where he completed primary school and attended secondary school. After matriculating, he studied law at the University of the Witwatersrand (1965‚Äì1968), after which he completed his BJuris degree through the University of South Africa whilst serving legal articles at a law firm (1969‚Äì1970). At university, he became a Marxist and anti-apartheid activist. He studied the major works of Marx and other communist writers. As an activist participating in anti-apartheid demonstrations and underground meetings he often found himself at odds with the law and the police. He went on to work with Winnie Mandela, and other anti-apartheid leaders, and did courier work for the ANC. Activism Louw experienced a \\"philosophical shift\\" during his early twenties when he was an article clerk at one of South Africa's leading law firms. His activist life took a new turn due to an event that changed his life and led ultimately to the work he does now: :\\"Every day I saw and occasionally patronised an old black lady who would sell fruit on the sidewalk outside our law offices. One day I saw the police kick her basket of fruit into the street, and chase her down around the corner where they caught and arrested her, They threw her violently into their police van, and drove off. I dropped what I was doing and followed. They took her to central Johannesburg police station where I spent the rest of the day trying to get her released\\". Louw asked his employer to investigate the plight of informal black traders and to provide them with legal defence. After telling him that it was \\"none of their business\\", his employer reluctantly allowed Louw to work pro bono for illegal street vendors, taxi operators and cottage industries. It was at this point that Louw first found himself questioning Marxism, especially its anti- business and anti-individual liberty dogma, which he would later abandon, by virtue of what he observed \\"in the real world\\", as he puts it, and under the influence of a colleague who introduced him to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy. In defence of informal traders, Louw began to work with a trade unionist from the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), Laurence Mavundla, who, like Louw, had been enraged by the notorious \\"Granny Moyo\\" incident ‚Äì she died due to head injuries suffered when tossed into a police van ‚Äì and other atrocities perpetrated against what Louw saw as aspirant black capitalists. He teamed up with Mavundla's African Chamber of Hawkers and Informal Businesses (ACHIB), and worked with others in the black community for the liberation of black taxi operators, peasant farmers and informal contractors. His work entailed representing street vendors in court cases, reclaiming their confiscated merchandise, seeking injunctions against illegal raids, arrests and brutality, confronting and obstructing police who were harassing small enterprise owners, and organising or joining protest action. A widely used online biography describes Louw's past and present activism as follows: : \\"Small and micro business, and black economic empowerment, have been Leon Louw‚Äôs principle interest throughout his public life. He has been intimately involved with and a prominent activist for organised and informal SMMEs, starting with the fledgling National African Federation of Chambers of Commerce (NAFCOC) and Johannesburg Street Vendors in the late 1960s. Much of his life presently is spent with grassroots black communities in tribal areas and inner cities, fighting for their right to trade freely and own the land they occupy.\\" In 1977, Louw was the Legal Manager at the Association of Chambers of Commerce of South Africa. Louw was one of the co-founders of the Free Market Foundation of Southern Africa (FMF) in 1975, and is currently the Executive Director of the organisation. He often represents the FMF in print and broadcast media, and at FMF events. In March 1981, Louw said of affirmative action: : \\"The most offensive aspect of affirmative action is the way it humiliates blacks. It implies that they are inferior, that they are not good enough to handle legal equality with whites. It is the most devious and arrogant form of white pseudo-liberal paternalism.\\" In the early 1980s, Louw was the Chairman of the Commission of Inquiry into Ciskei Economic Policy. In 1987, at a conference of the Institute for Democratic Alternatives in South Africa (IDASA) in Port Elizabeth, Louw said that the struggle against apartheid was about winning freedom, not power, for black South Africans, and that whites were concerned that a black government would be coercive. He argued that democracy and economic freedom were interdependent concepts which cannot exist in each other's absence. In the same year, at a symposium in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. in Atlanta, Georgia, Louw said that a peaceful solution to apartheid South Africa's race conflict would be to include blacks in the freedoms whites had until that point enjoyed. Whites, on the other hand, would require security of their already-existing freedoms, against a potentially-vengeful black government. Above all, the solution must include \\"the abolition of apartheid, full equality before the law and citizenship for all\\". Despite Louw's activism he never joined any political organisation. His low-level courier work for the ANC, and general political networking, involved communicating between exiled structures of the organisation and the underground movement in South Africa. He met regularly with people in other political formations including AZAPO, the Pan Africanist Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. He was chairman of one of South Africa's illegal non- racial schools, the Woodmead Montessori Primary School, which was attended inter alia by his children and by Nelson and Winnie Mandela's granddaughter Zoleka, who became a close school friend of his daughter, Camilla. Through the school, his activism and one of his books endorsed by Ms Mandela, he and his wife, Frances Kendall, befriended the Mandela family. They helped Winnie Mandela in her work to support families of detainees, and Ms Mandela arranged daily transport from the distant Soweto to their school for her granddaughter and a dozen or so other Soweto children. Louw met and got to know many South African and foreign political, business and intellectual luminaries, including Thabo Mbeki, his father Govan Mbeki, Jacob Zuma, FW de Klerk, Dr Anton Rupert, Harry Oppenheimer, Clem Sunter, Marinus Wiechers, Dr Sam Motsuenyane (now President of the FMF), Helen Suzman, Alan Paton, Nthato Motlana, Albertina and Walter Sisulu, Chief Buthelezi, Dirk Hertzog, Jan S Marais, Andreas Wassenaar, Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, Hendrik Verwoed Jr, Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow Coretta Scott King, Thomas Sowell, Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, James M. Buchanan, Israel Kirzner, Margaret Thatcher, and Walter E. Williams amongst many others. Books Louw co-authored with his wife Frances Kendall two best-selling books: South Africa, the Solution (Amagi, 1986) and Let the People Govern (Amagi, 1989). He ghost-wrote a novel set in India, The Deal Maker (2010, Rupa, Delhi), and co-authored Towards Freehold - Options for Land and Development (JUTA, 1988), and McGregor‚Äôs Economic Alternatives (JUTA, 1990). He has contributions in many publications, and wrote Habits of Highly Effective Countries (LRP, 2000), which is a statistical and empirical analysis of the characteristics associated with countries considered \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\". CODESA Louw and the Free Market Foundation were major contributors to the CODESA process in which the current democratic constitution of South Africa was negotiated. He was also the convenor of what became known as the \\"business caucus\\", through which business leaders negotiated successfully for the inclusion of property rights in the Bill of Rights. He gave evidence on many occasions to various CODESA and, subsequently, Parliamentary constitutional committees. He was told years later by one of the secretaries that these submissions generated a great deal of interest and made a significant contribution to the inclusion of various provisions. The FMF's submissions contributed, for instance, to the devolution of exclusive powers to local and regional tiers of government, the inclusion in the limitation clause of the requirement that limitations of rights must be \\"justifiable in an open and democratic\\", and the inclusion of the administrative justice clause (section 32), the freedom of trade clause (section 22), and the rule of law as a justiciable foundational provision in the first section of the Constitution (section 1(c)). Influences When asked which prominent thinkers influenced his beliefs and principles the most, Louw lists (chronologically) Ayn Rand, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, Friedrich Hayek, Thomas Sowell, Donald Symons, and Matt Ridley. Personal life Louw is married to Frances Kendall (1978) and has three daughters, Justine, Camilla and Katherine. His current interests, recreations and hobbies include philosophy, classical music, travel, the outdoors, chess, jogging, cycling and gym.

It was owned and operated by Hong Kong Electric.  History  North Point was chosen as the location for the new power station because at the time of construction it was a long way from the Hong Kong urban area of Victoria. The project began in 1913 but due to the outbreak of World War I the plant did not become operational until the summer of 1919. On commissioning the plant had a total generating capacity of around . The road in front of the site was renamed Electric Road while the presence of the plant gave nearby \\"Power Street\\" (Â§ßÂº∑Ë°ó) its name. = Battle of Hong Kong = In 1941, during the Battle of Hong Kong just prior to the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong the plant was severely damaged during artillery and aerial bombardment. The battle of the North Point Power station occurred shortly after the Japanese troops landed on the North Point short and tried to push through towards Wan Chai. The plant was hastily defended by members of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps, Punjab Regiment and stragglers from the Middlesex Machine Gun unit in Hong Kong. The Power station was taken after fierce fighting, and a platoon of Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps Armoured Cars attempted a counter-attack. However, all the armoured cars received hits from Japanese artillery and armoured weapons. All members of the platoon died except for a Lieutenant who managed to escape. Casualties from the battle included the plant's manager Vincent Sorby, who later died in a prison camp of wounds received during the attack. p. 221 After the war, the plant was repaired and extended several times to cope with growing electricity demand in 1950s Hong Kong. By 1966 its output had reached . = Later history and decommissioning = At 10:26 am on the morning of 25 March 1977, a fire broke out at the plant causing power cuts on Hong Kong Island stretching from Central to Shau Kei Wan. The fire originated in a cable terminating room on the ground floor and was fuelled by a large quantity of oil-filled cables and cable oil. Traffic ground to a halt owing to disabled traffic lights and trams. The fire was put out by 12:57 pm. Aside from the above incident, except for during its early years and because of wartime damage, only two blackouts occurred at North Point during its operational lifetime. One was caused by a fire at the plant in 1930 and the other occurred when a shoal of fish were sucked into the cooling system the same year. As Hong Kong developed, North Point Power Station was gradually assimilated into the urban area. In 1968, the plant's adverse effect on the local environment led to Hong Kong Electric building a new power station at Ap Lei Chau. North Point was officially decommissioned in 1978. The former power station is now part of the large scale City Garden housing development.

Terminology  The term \\"Identity Intelligence\\" has been diffused throughout the course of 2010, also thanks to its adoption by Gartner, and refers mainly to the following set of capabilities: * the presence, within an organization, of a full repository of user accounts, able to effectively collect every information characterizing the users and their access rights. The difference is substantial if compared to the \\"standard\\" repositories used by the Identity Management solutions, typically simpler and less suited for complex analysis. * the ability to relate information from different target and authoritative sources, in order to correctly and efficiently populate the repository. In complex environments, data about users and user accounts are collected from dozens or hundreds of different sources, using different standards, different structures and different technologies. In order to allow quick, detailed and complete analysis, it is essential to have a tool that can collect, relate and homogenize all this data. * The ability to build complex analysis, based on the principles of business intelligence, providing valuable information in relation with:  the state of the users within the organization,  the quality of the user management processes.  an overview of user identities and their access within the enterprise.  an ability to relate identity information with various entities within the organization such as assets, resources etc. :At the same time, monitoring and reporting systems which operate on a complete repository, offer security features and advanced control.  Why do you need \\"Intelligence\\" before \\"Management\\"?  The need for Identity Intelligence tools and models comes with the awareness, developed in recent years, that an Identity Management system used for the sole purpose of automating the user account management, exploits its possibilities only in part. In recent years the 'Identity Management solutions are increasingly seen as tools addressed to security governance, tools used increase security, tools used to meet the compliance requirements that organizations must meet in order to satisfy regulatory constraints, to obtain certifications and to satisfy internal and external audit. The assumption to the adoption of an Identity Intelligence solution is that \\"you can not manage what you can not measure\\". In order to properly manage user accounts and identities, you must first be able to get to know them in detail. For these reasons, between 2010 and 2011 the evolution trend shows how companies adopt mechanisms and instruments of Identity Intelligence from the early stages of the life cycle of their Identity Management systems. The most innovative approach that provides the Identity Intelligence is introduced in the company even before the 'Identity Management, so that it can serve as a support in the definition of requirements and the model of Identity Management to be performed. This approach, while introducing the cost of a preliminary stage, it increases the chances of success of a project of Identity Management, allows to have information about the status of the User Management useful to ascertain the real need for such a project and gives you a snapshot of the situation to the \\"time0, \\"to which you can always see in the future to measure the success or failure of projects.

The painting depicts an itinerant family; a woman with her child on her lap and a man boiling a billy for tea. The painting's name comes from the colloquial Australian term \\"On the wallaby track\\" used to describe itinerant rural workers or \\"swagmen\\" moving from place to place for work. The work has been described as \\"among the best known and most popularly admired of Australian paintings\\". McCubbin painted the work near his residence in Brighton, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne. He used his family as models--his wife Annie for the woman and his young son John for the baby. Michael Moriaty, Annie's younger brother, was the model for the man. An infra-red photograph of the painting revealed that the head of the woman was originally painted facing the viewer and only later turned to face away. The painting is now part of the collection of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, having been bought in 1897 for ¬£126. The work is popularly known in Australia due to its use in an advertisement for Kit Kat chocolate bars in the 1980s. On 17 June 1981, the painting was used on an Australian $2 postage stamp. Scottish-Australian poet and bush balladeer Will H. Ogilvie (1869‚Äì1963) wrote the poem 'The wallaby track' which was printed in The Bulletin in 6 June 1896, the same year as McCubbin's painting. The poem was later included in Ogilvie's inaugural anthology Fair girls and gray horses.

Another application simulated the transfer behaviour of passengers at the North Melbourne Station in Australia.More information: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228919806_Passenger_and_Pedestrian_Modelling_at_Transport_Facilities Research 2015 PTV was coordinating the project BESTFACT with the aim to collect, develop, and publicise best practices and innovations in the field of freight transport and thus allow a broad use of this information.http://compass.ptvgroup.com/2016/02/bestfact-forging-ahead-with- innovation/?lang=en The aim of the project Modulushca, also coordinated by PTV, was to create a closer pan-European network for the logistics industry in close cooperation with its North American partners and the international Physical Internet Initiative.http://www.modulushca.eu/index.php/the-project PTV is involved in the iHub project, which has the aim to develop and use one platform that ensures efficient vehicle operations and vehicle fleet management.http://compass.ptvgroup.com/2017/02/ihub-evs-or-no-evs/?lang=en PTV is involved in the European FLOW project that focuses on urban road transport, analysing the role of pedestrians and cyclists. The core of PTV's contribution corresponds to the improvement of the existing transport simulation software (PTV Visum, PTV Vissim and PTV Viswalk), as well as the development of a socio-economic impact assessment to better analyse the impacts of walking and cycling measures on the road transport network performance, and thereby on congestion.http://h2020-flow.eu/methodology/modelling-in-flow/ At IAA Commercial Vehicles 2010 in Hanover, Germany, PTV presented the results of the study on intelligent cargo systems. The research study was carried out on behalf of the European Commission and focused on intelligent freight transport. It presents scenarios in 2020 and 2035 and analyses the increasing demand for efficient and sustainable logistics and the complex planning tasks for global transport chains covering all modes of transport. Since 2008, PTV has been involved in research projects focusing on the sustainable development of megacities, such as \\"Climate and Energy in a Complex Transition Process towards Sustainable Hyderabad\\". The aim is to develop urban-planning concepts until 2013. These concepts will then be used as the basis for decision-making processes concerning future transport systems and traffic infrastructure. A new routing method for urban transport has been developed by PTV as part of the CVIS project which is funded by the European Commission. Route recommendations provided by cities and communities can also be included in this strategic routing method, which was presented to the public with live driving demonstrations in November 2009.PTV demonstrates new 'Strategic Routing' system http://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/news.php?NewsID=17770 In cooperation with its 28 project partners, PTV is involved in the research initiative AKTIV (i.e., \\"Adaptive and Cooperative Technologies for Intelligent Traffic\\"), whose aim is to make future traffic and transportation safer and more efficient. To this end, new driver assistance systems, information technologies, and software solutions for efficient traffic management will be developed by the project team. As part of AKTIV, PTV has created a network which allows communication between the traffic management system, the car, and the road infrastructure. In 2009 PTV used its transportation planning software PTV Vision for the simulation of the traffic flow to and from Yas Marina Circuit, the Formula One track in Abu Dhabi. This simulation included all modes of transport in a single model and it was also possible to model the behaviour of the Formula One fans at the grandstandsPTV Vissim and Viswalk: Simulation for the first F1 race at Yas Marina Circuit, Abu Dhabi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQ_8uxsYYpM Integrated solutions for green ITS (Intelligent Transport Systems) and logistics can potentially deliver up to 20% overall fuel savings and CO2 emissions reduction. The European Union therefore initiated the research project eCoMove in spring 2010. A consortium of 32 partners will test the energy efficiency of cooperative systems and services until March 2013. PTV AG is also a member of the ecoMove consortium and is involved in three of the six sub-projects, focussing on car-to-x- communication, cooperative, eco-friendly traffic management & control, and ecoFreight & Logistics. PTV is consortium partner of the research project for urban and autonomous freight logistics, efeuCampus in Bruchsal, funded by the European Union and the state Baden-W√ºrttemberg.

The track was recorded for the soundtrack to David Lynch's 1997 film Lost Highway. It was written by the band's eponymous vocalist and produced by Manson with Sean Beavan. Lynch personally chose the band to contribute music to the soundtrack as he found Manson inspiring, and because of the band's commercial viability. An industrial song about obsession, \\"Apple of Sodom\\" was named after the eponymous fruit, and was inspired by Manson's feelings about singer Fiona Apple. The song was followed by multiple collaborations between Manson and Lynch. The track received a mainly positive response from music critics, who commended its composition. A music video was directed by Joseph Cultice, although initially was not made public due to its low-budget nature and depiction of nudity. The clip was released to YouTube in 2009. It garnered critical acclaim and comparisons to the work of Manson's contemporaries. Background Lynch in 2007 At the suggestion of a mutual friend, David Lynch chose Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails to produce the soundtrack to his film Lost Highway (1997). Lynch wanted the soundtrack to feature well-known artists of his choosing who were inspirational to him, as well as commercially viable. Among the artists chosen were Marilyn Manson, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, Lou Reed, The Smashing Pumpkins and Rammstein. According to John Balance of Coil, a band that was once going to be featured on the soundtrack album, Lynch \\"wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whoever he could get. He just said, 'These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.' He didn't give a fuck about the integrity.\\" When deciding the album's musical direction, Reznor came to the conclusion that it should appeal to fans of Lynch who hate pop music; at the same time, he wanted it to \\"have some degree of accessibility for the 13-, 14-year-old kid who buys it because I have a new song on it; or for the Smashing Pumpkins fan who buys it for that.\\" Lynch met Manson through Reznor. After meeting with Lynch, Manson contributed two songs to the soundtrack: \\"Apple of Sodom\\", which was written specifically for Lost Highway, and a cover of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins; the latter had previously been featured on the band's platinum- selling extended play Smells Like Children (1995). Manson told Alternative Press that \\"Apple of Sodom\\" is \\"very much a part of\\" Antichrist Superstar (1996), despite the fact that it does not appear on that album. A rumor circulated that Lynch wanted Manson to contribute more music to the soundtrack than he did. However, this has been disputed by Reznor. Manson appeared in Lost Highway in a cameo appearance as a pornographic film actor who unknowingly stars in a snuff film. The role marked Manson's first appearance in a movie. His bandmate Twiggy Ramirez also had a cameo in the film. Since Lynch and Manson met during the production of Lost Highway, Lynch has written an introduction to Manson's biography The Long Hard Road Out of Hell (1998), and the two have collaborated on both an art show and a coffee table book titled Genealogies of Pain (2011). Composition and lyrical interpretation \\"Apple of Sodom\\" is an industrial song with a length of four minutes and twenty-six seconds. It was written by Manson and produced by the vocalist alongside Sean Beavan. Kurt B. Reighley writes in his book Marilyn Manson that the track derives its name from the fruit known as the apple of Sodom. Reighley notes that, if consumed, an apple of Sodom can cause paralysis, severe tremors or death; the toxicity of the apple is referred to in the song's lyric \\"I've got something you can never eat\\". The track opens with a whispered, \\"barely audible\\" line of dialogue from Lost Highway, where the character of Alice says \\"You will never have me.\\" \\"Apple of Sodom\\" has minimal production led primarily by bass. It features a drum beat reminiscent of jungle music, and a vocal performance that has been described as crooning and a growl. AllMusic and Dan Epstein of Revolver both called the song \\"ominous\\". Apple performing in 2012 The song includes lyrics such as \\"I‚Äôm dying, I hope you‚Äôre dying too\\" and \\"take this from me/hate me, hate me\\". According to Katie Rife of The A.V. Club, \\"Apple of Sodom\\" uses imagery of moral decay, physical decay, and original sin. Reighley wrote that the song's lyrics make it similar to the songs on the band's album Antichrist Superstar, while AllMusic perceived themes of sex, seduction and reflection in the track. Manson discussed the song's meaning in a 1998 Spin article, saying \\"that song's about obsession and things you can never have\\". He added that \\"in a distant way\\" it was inspired by his feelings toward Fiona Apple, a singer he deemed \\"sexy and fragile‚Äîdefinitely too fragile for me\\". Manson elaborated that he was a \\"huge fan\\" of Apple's music, and that \\"If I was ever to be put in a circumstance where I could have sex with her, I would decline because her vagina is probably too precious to be dirtied by my filthy cock.\\" Critical reception In a review of the Lost Highway soundtrack, The Daily Aztec praised \\"Apple of Sodom\\" and the band's version of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\", saying that they \\"both make listeners feel like they're entering something dangerous. Manson's screaming and jungle drum beats give the songs a sarcastic, stereotypical horror film feeling, and at the same time the tunes are among the catchiest on the record.\\" James P. Wisdom of Pitchfork described \\"Apple of Sodom\\" and \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" as \\"reasonably good\\" and superior to the Angelo Badalamenti instrumentals on the Lost Highway album. Katie Rife of The A.V. Club called \\"Apple of Sodom\\" a \\"grimy\\" song that \\"straddles the line between the erotic and the terrifying\\". Fact deemed it one of the greatest songs ever to appear in or be inspired by a Lynch project, alongside the Pixies' cover of \\"In Heaven\\" from Eraserhead (1977) and Julee Cruise's \\"Falling\\" from Twin Peaks. Kerrang!s Jason Arnopp said that the song \\"sees the band in sinister, down-paced mode, brilliantly complementing the overall feel of the soundtrack.\\" Daisy Jones of Dazed said that Manson's \\"razor-sharp\\" contributions to the soundtrack helped Lost Highway become a cult film. Alec Chillingworth of Metal Hammer put \\"Apple of Sodom\\" fourth on the magazine's list of Manson's ten most underrated songs. Chillingworth wrote that \\"the track never really kicks off. And that's the beauty of it. It's not about a quiet/loud dynamic. It's not about a chorus that's going to stay on the radio until radios are no more. 'Apple of Sodom' is an early example of Manson being able to evoke a precise atmosphere through nothing more than bare instrumentation and that inimitable voice of his.\\" Slant Magazine Jeremiah Kipp felt that the inclusion of Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails songs in Lost Highway \\"places [the film] in the mid-1990s...sadly losing the timelessness of most of Lynch's work\\". Music video A music video was made for the song, directed by Joseph Cultice. According to Manson, it never aired on MTV due to its depiction of nudity and its low-budget nature. It was released to the public in 2009, when Cultice uploaded it to YouTube. In a review of the video for Bloody Disgusting, Jonathan Barkan commented: \\"This is one of those videos that is so iconically from the early to mid 90s. The out of focus moments, the strange, sinister imagery, the strong usage of colors to highlight the different vignettes.\\" Barkan called the video \\"pretty\\" and noted similarities between it and the music videos of Manson's contemporaries Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Tool. Dan Epstein of Revolver said: \\"In retrospect, the video's grainy quality actually makes it powerfully effective, especially in the cinematic scene where the nude, alien-like female pulls a plug out of her torso and proceeds to bleed to death.\\" Epstein ranked the clip fourth on Revolvers list of the \\"5 Most Horrifying Moments from Marilyn Manson Music Videos\\". Noisey Alexandra Serio viewed the nudity in the clip as part of the band's history of \\"pissing off Jesus Christ\\".

She draws her inspirations from the worlds of nature and history, using organic objects such as seed pods, leaves, insects and skeletons, that are collected largely from where she lives, in the Savernake Forest. She uses a Renaissance ceramicist technique, \\"casting from life,\\" where the pieces are electro-formed and cast in gold and silver, thereby transforming these raw objects into exact replicas of wearable art. All the jewellery is produced in small workshops in England, further giving the brand an English identity.  Philanthropy  Philippa has participated in a series of charity fundraisers. In 2010, Philippa rode 100 miles of southwest England on sidesaddle and raised funds for the breast cancer charity, Too Many Women.

House suggests that she break the rules if it is so important to her, but she refuses. After talking once more with the patient, Masters causes Kendall to experience bradycardia and convinces the parents that the cancer has caused a clot to lodge in her heart.

He is currently a session musician and songwriter of the band Primal Fear, as well as for other projects like his own Free Fall. Biography Magnus attended school to study classical guitar when he was 10 years old. Later on he was very much into \\"The New Wave of British Heavy Metal\\" of bands such as Iron Maiden, Dio, Judas Priest and Black Sabbath. His influences as a guitarist were Steve Morse, Steve Vai and Allan Holdsworth. He has played in various metal and fusion bands early on and developed a style which mixes metal and folk music. His first critically acclaimed musical project was with the band Last Tribe, which has released three full-length albums. In 2004, Magnus started to work as a session musician in a project put together by Frontiers Records, which had the intention to have two acclaimed heavy metal vocalists singing together as a duet. The project ended up featuring powerhouse vocalists Russell Allen (Symphony X) and J√∏rn Lande (ex-Masterplan) and was simply called Allen/Lande. The project released its first three albums with all music and the majority of lyrics written by Magnus Karlsson, featuring a variety of hard rock and heavy metal songs with a progressive metal touch. In the same year he also started to write music for a project with singer Tony Harnell (TNT), drummer John Macaluso (Ark, TNT, Yngwie Malmsteen) and bassist Fabrizio Grossi (Steve Vai) that would later on become the band Starbreaker. In 2008, he worked with Magnum vocalist Bob Catley on his solo album Immortal writing all the songs himself . The same year, Magnus joined German metal band Primal Fear making a big contribution to the band's songwriting. He also teamed up with the band's bassist and leader Mat Sinner to work in a number of projects released by Frontiers Records, such as Kiske/Somerville (another singer-duet project, featuring ex-Helloween singer Michael Kiske and American singer and vocal coach Amanda Somerville) and the first solo album by Primal Fear frontman Ralf Scheepers. In 2013 it was announced that Magnus Karlsson would release his first solo musical project called Free Fall on 11 June in North America and 14 June in Europe by Frontiers Records. It features many guest singers who worked with Magnus before, including Russell Allen, Ralf Scheepers, Tony Harnell, Rickard Bengtsson (former bandmate from Last Tribe), Mark Boals (who worked with Magnus in the project The Codex), Mike Andersson (who worked with Magnus in the project Planet Alliance) and other guests like David Readman (Pink Cream 69, Voodoo Circle), Rick Altzi (At Vance, Masterplan) and Herman Saming (A.C.T). Magnus also sings three tracks on the album himself and Daniel Flores (who also worked with Magnus in the project The Codex) recorded the drums. Magnus also wrote songs for the melodic hard rock project Place Vendome, 'My Guardian Angel' from the album Streets of Fire, 'Break Out' from the album Thunder in the Distance and 'Falling Star' from the album Close to the Sun. The second Free Fall album has been announced to be released in 2015. It's called Kingdom of Rock and features the following guests: J√∏rn Lande, Tony Martin (ex-Black Sabbath), Joe Lynn Turner (ex-Rainbow, ex-Deep Purple), Jakob Samuel (The Poodles, also worked with Magnus in the band Midnight Sun), Harry Hess (Harem Scarem), Rebecca De La Moite, and once again Tony Harnell, Rick Altzi and David Readman, the last three also sang in the first album. Jaime Salazar (who worked with Magnus on bands Last Tribe, Planet Alliance, Midnight Sun and the Allen/Lande project) recorded the drums. The album's release date is 6 November 2015. In 2017, it was announced another new project featuring songwriting, production and playing from Magnus Karlsson called The Ferrymen. The self-titled album also features drummer Mike Terrana (Vision Divine, Avalanch) and singer Ronnie Romero (Lords of Black, Rainbow). In 2018, Magnus and Tony Harnell reunited to record the third album of Starbreaker which is titled Dysphoria and was released on January 25, 2019. It also features bassist Jonni Lightfoot and drummer Anders K√∂llerfors.

It is a well preserved, recently excavated site, occupying an entire hill with wide views of the surrounding lands. Believed to be the largest hill fort in Ireland, it is one of the region's main tourist attractions. Location and physical description Mooghaun is situated in the parish of Mooghaun South, north north-east of Newmarket on Fergus, on the grounds of Dromoland Castle. It has three concentric limestone ramparts of defence, all built at the same time. The outermost wall encloses , the middle one , and the innermost .Grogan, 1993 (cited by University of Notre Dame reference) It occupies the summit of a hill with views, nowadays largely obscured by trees, of the chiefdom it controlled. The grounds also hold a number of cashels which are of later date. History The hill fort was built at the beginning of the late Bronze Age, around 950 BC. At the time, Mooghaun was the largest and most important site in the area. It holds three cashels, which were built after 500 AD.Grogan, 1999 p30 For the construction of the defending walls, stones of the original ramparts were used. Beside the cashels, outlines of round houses were found.Grogan, 1999 p31 Perhaps 10 or 12 families lived within the bounds of the hill fort. These families tended to farm land within the enclosure and also kept livestock there.Grogan, 1999 p20 They lived mainly in the middle enclosure.Grogan, 1999 p33 The people who directed its construction were the leaders over a chiefdom in south-east Clare that covered an area of about .Grogan, 1999 p11; p14 The chiefdom is considered to have been bordered by the Shannon estuary to the south, and mountain ranges to the north, east and west. Their territory was divided into smaller territories of about , which were controlled by important families. These lived in smaller defended hilltop sites and lake settlements.Grogan, 1999 p14 The less important families lived in settlements that were enclosed by low stone banks. These often occurred in clusters, each farming an area of about 154 to 315 hectares (381 to 778 acres).Grogan, 1999 p16 The site of the cashels was used in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century by the inhabitants of the nearby Dromoland estate as a viewing point or even a picnic spot. To facilitate this use, much of the interior was destroyed and repairs were made to the walls.Grogan, 1999 p31 Mooghaun North Hoard A very large hoard of Late Bronze Age gold jewellery was discovered in the neighbouring parish of Mooghaun North in 1854, during construction of a railway from Limerick to Ennis. It appears to have numbered several hundred objects, but most were sold to jewellers and melted down, though many replicas were made. Only 29 originals survive, divided between the National Museum of Ireland and the British Museum. Most objects were plain gold hoops in various sizes, from bracelets (the majority) to torcs, with some wide gold collars also. There were some ingots. The find was near Mooghaun Lough and was probably a ritual deposit, which must have represented a huge amount of wealth at the time.Wallace, 99 Notes References Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds.

A scalar density refers to the w=1 case. Relative scalars are an important special case of the more general concept of a relative tensor. Ordinary scalar An ordinary scalar or absolute scalar refers to the w=0 case. If x^i and bar{x}^j refer to the same point P on the manifold, then we desire bar{f}(bar{x}^j) = f(x^i). This equation can be interpreted two ways when bar{x}^j are viewed as the \\"new coordinates\\" and x^i are viewed as the \\"original coordinates\\". The first is as bar{f}(bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(bar{x}^j)), which \\"converts the function to the new coordinates\\". The second is as f(x^i)=bar{f}(bar{x}^j(x^i)), which \\"converts back to the original coordinates. Of course, \\"new\\" or \\"original\\" is a relative concept. There are many physical quantities that are represented by ordinary scalars, such as temperature and pressure. =Weight 0 example= Suppose the temperature in a room is given in terms of the function f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5 in Cartesian coordinates (x,y,z) and the function in cylindrical coordinates (r,t,h) is desired. The two coordinate systems are related by the following sets of equations: : r = sqrt{x^2 + y^2} , : t = arctan(y/x) , : h = z , and : x = r cos(t) , : y = r sin(t) , : z = h. , Using bar{f}(bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(bar{x}^j)) allows one to derive bar{f}(r,t,h)= 2 r cos(t)+ r sin(t) + 5 as the transformed function. Consider the point P whose Cartesian coordinates are (x,y,z)=(2,3,4) and whose corresponding value in the cylindrical system is (r,t,h)=(sqrt{13},arctan{(3/2)},4). A quick calculation shows that f(2,3,4)=12 and bar{f}(sqrt{13},arctan{(3/2)},4)=12 also. This equality would have held for any chosen point P. Thus, f(x,y,z) is the \\"temperature function in the Cartesian coordinate system\\" and bar{f}(r,t,h) is the \\"temperature function in the cylindrical coordinate system\\". One way to view these functions is as representations of the \\"parent\\" function that takes a point of the manifold as an argument and gives the temperature. The problem could have been reversed. One could have been given bar{f} and wished to have derived the Cartesian temperature function f. This just flips the notion of \\"new\\" vs the \\"original\\" coordinate system. Suppose that one wishes to integrate these functions over \\"the room\\", which will be denoted by D. (Yes, integrating temperature is strange but that's partly what's to be shown.) Suppose the region D is given in cylindrical coordinates as r from [0,2], t from [0,pi/2] and h from [0,2] (that is, the \\"room\\" is a quarter slice of a cylinder of radius and height 2). The integral of f over the region D is : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^sqrt{2^2-x^2} ! int_0^2 ! f(x,y,z) , dz , dy , dx = 16 + 10 pi. The value of the integral of bar{f} over the same region is : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^{pi/2} ! int_0^2 ! bar{f}(r,t,h) , dh , dt , dr = 12 + 10 pi. They are not equal. The integral of temperature is not independent of the coordinate system used. It is non-physical in that sense, hence \\"strange\\". Note that if the integral of bar{f} included a factor of the Jacobian (which is just r), we get : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^{pi/2} ! int_0^2 ! bar{f}(r,t,h) r , dh , dt , dr = 16 + 10 pi, which is equal to the original integral but it is not however the integral of temperature because temperature is a relative scalar of weight 0, not a relative scalar of weight 1. =Weight 1 example= If we had said f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5 was representing mass density, however, then its transformed value should include the Jacobian factor that takes into account the geometric distortion of the coordinate system. The transformed function is now bar{f}(r,t,h)= (2 r cos(t)+ r sin(t) + 5) r. This time f(2,3,4)=12 but bar{f}(sqrt{13},arctan{(3/2)},4)=12sqrt{29}. As before is integral (the total mass) in Cartesian coordinates is : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^sqrt{2^2-x^2} ! int_0^2 ! f(x,y,z) , dz , dy , dx = 16 + 10 pi. The value of the integral of bar{f} over the same region is : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^{pi/2} ! int_0^2 ! bar{f}(r,t,h) , dh , dt , dr = 16 + 10 pi. They are equal. The integral of mass density gives total mass which is a coordinate- independent concept. Note that if the integral of bar{f} also included a factor of the Jacobian like before, we get : int_0^2 ! int_{0}^{pi/2} ! int_0^2 ! bar{f}(r,t,h) r , dh , dt , dr = 24 + 40 pi /3, which is not equal to the previous case. Other cases Weights other than 0 and 1 do not arise as often. It can be shown the determinant of a type (0,2) tensor is a relative scalar of weight 2.

Its main design objectives are high expressive power, extensibility, safety, reliability, and efficient execution. Language Characteristics Ciao provides a full Prolog system (supporting ISO-Prolog), declarative subsets and extensions of Prolog, functional programming (including lazy evaluation), higher-order (with predicate abstractions), constraint programming, and objects, as well as feature terms (records), persistence, several control rules (breadth-first search, iterative deepening, ...), concurrency (threads/engines), distributed execution (agents), and parallel execution. Libraries also support WWW programming, sockets, external interfaces (C, Java, TclTk, relational databases, etc.), etc. Ciao is built on a kernel with an extensible modular design which allows both restricting and extending the language ‚Äî it can be seen as a language building language. These restrictions and extensions can be activated separately on each program module so that several extensions can coexist in the same application for different modules. Developing Safe and Reliable Programs Programming in the large in Ciao is supported via: * A robust module/object system. This provides module-based separate/incremental compilation (which is automatic without need for makefiles). * An integrated assertion language for declaring (optional) program properties (specifications). These include types, modes, determinacy, non-failure, cost (time, memory), etc. * Automatic inference and static/dynamic checking of such assertions (including unit testing). Ciao has also support for programming in the small: the compiler is capable of producing small executables (including only those builtins used by the program) and the interpreter supports scripting. The environment includes a classical top-level and an evolved emacs interface with an embeddable source- level debugger and a number of execution visualization tools. The Ciao preprocessor supports static debugging and verification assertion checking and optimization via source to source program transformation. These tasks are performed by Ciaopp, distributed separately). Auto-Documentation Ciao includes lpdoc, an automatic documentation generator. It processes programs adorned with (Ciao) assertions and machine-readable comments and generates manuals in many formats including HTML, pdf, texinfo, info, man, etc., as well as on-line help, ascii README files, entries for indices of manuals (info, WWW, ...), and maintains WWW distribution sites. Portability and Efficiency The Ciao compiler (which can be run outside the top level shell) generates several forms of architecture-independent and stand-alone executables, which run with speed, efficiency and executable size which are very competitive with other high-level languages in general and in particular with commercial and academic Prolog/CLP systems. Modules can be compiled into compact bytecode or C source files, and linked statically, dynamically, or autoloaded.

It is the first of Reichs's novels to be written specifically for a young-adult audience. Plot Tory and her friends, Hiram (mostly known as Hi), Ben and Shelton, find a rusted dog tag dating from the Vietnam War era on Loggerhead Island, and trying to identify its owner leads them to an unsolved murder and infection by an experimental virus that gives them special powers, which they describe as \\"flaring\\". Their powers include super strength, speed and senses. They acquire the infection while saving a wolfdog being used for illegal experiments by Dr. Karsten who was funded by a company which belongs to Chance Claybourne's Dad. Meanwhile, they discover a skeleton who proves to be the daughter of the owner of the dog-tag. But some people shoot at them, which forces them to run. They manage to escape, but the next time they visit ( with their parents and a police officer ), the skeleton has been replaced with monkey bones. They were called 'over imaginative children' and the police left it at that. But being curious and Tory more than anything wanted to find out who did it and using their powers they crack the case. Characters Additional to the recurring characters of the series, the following characters appear. *Dr. Marcus E. Karsten - Professor and Department Chair,at Charleston University College of Veterinary Medicine; Head Administrator at LIRI (Loggerhead Island Research Institute). Dr Karsten is described by Tory as 'Late fifties. skinny. glasses. dark, thinning hair worn in the ever-popular comb-over.' Dr Karsten was being paid by Candela Pharmaceuticals to research a cure for canine parvovirus or, failing that, to create a new 'designer virus' that only a Candela product could cure. However, while trying to find a mechanism to weaken the canine strain, he accidentally created a new type of parvovirus which had the potential to infect humans. By mixing two types of parvovirus (one that infects humans and another that infects dogs) he created a new strand called PARVOVIRUS XPB-19. Dr Karsten is often annoyed that Tory and her friends come to Loggerhead and makes life difficult for them. When unknown enemies threatened to kill the Virals, Karsten stayed behind so the others could get away, and he was killed. *Hannah Wythe ‚Äì She was Chance Claybourne's girlfriend. She is described as having long auburn hair and green eyes. She had Karsten murdered at the Viral's bunker after he tried to defend them. She later attempts to kill the Virals in the cellar of Claybourne Manor. It is there that she reveals that she had been working with Chance's father behind his back so that Chance wouldn't ruin their future together. She is later arrested along with Chance's driver for the murder of Karsten. *Hollis Claybourne ‚Äì He is Chance Claybourne's father. He is extremely strict and raised Chance single-handedly as his wife, Sally Claybourne died in childbirth. He was a vice president of Candela Pharmaceuticals. He murdered Katherine Heaton (before the events of this book) after she found out about bald eagles nesting on Cole Island as that would have hindered the sale of the island. He is later arrested for the murder of Katherine Heaton and many other crimes. *Tony Baravetto ‚Äì He was previously the driver to Chance Claybourne. Hollis Claybourne made him stalk Tory and the other Virals and he was later sent to murder Tory, Hi, Ben and Shelton at the bunker but they escaped leaving Karsten behind. He killed Karsten and dumped his body at sea. At Claybourne Manor, he attacked Tory in the kitchen but she managed to take him down. He was later arrested along with Chance's former girlfriend, Hannah Wythe for the murder of Dr Marcus Karsten and four counts of attempted murder.

His title was recorded as \\"Ye Emperor of Ye Easterne Shore and King of Ye Great Nussawattocks,\\" and he was also known familiarly as \\"the Laughing King\\". He also seems to be the same figure who was known variously in English records as Esmy Shichans, Tobot Deabot, and Okiawampe. The Accawmack, who numbered about 2000, were peripheral or nominal members of the Powhatan Confederacy. However, since water isolated them from the rest of Tsenacommacah (mainland Virginia), the Eastern Shore Indians had their own confederacy enjoying some measure of autonomy and peaceful rule under king Debedeavon. Each of his clan subchiefs paid him 8 bushels of corn, plus three arrowheads, as tribute each year. In 1608, a 13 year old English ensign named Thomas Savage was traded to Chief Powhatan for a native boy, Nemotacke, as something like a cultural exchange student. Powhatan adopted Savage, who became an interpreter between the two cultures, but the jealousy of that Chief's brother eventually led Savage to be sent to the relatively safer Eastern Shore, where Debedeavon gave him a large tract of land between Cheriton Creek and King's Creek that became known as Savage's Neck, under his son John Savage (1624-1667; Thomas having married emigrant Hannah Tyng in 1621). Indeed, during the starving time at Jamestown, Debedeavon sold the colonists much needed provisions. In 1621, the English colonists had spread along the peninsula from what had been their settlement on Plantation Creek. In 1621, Thomas Savage and Debedeavon warned the visiting Governor George Yeardley that Powhaton's tribe was plotting for a general uprising against Jamestown and the other colonists. The Governor was incredulous, but went to all the plantations and held musters despite Opechancanough's denial of any conspiracy. Those steps, however, led to sufficient defense that the colony was not annihilated in the Indian massacre of 1622. Moreover, Lady Elizabeth Dale, widow of Thomas Dale, left the western shore which was suffering from an epidemic (foul distemper), with 20 people including 8 boys who thus survived the massacres on her plantation under Debedeavon's benevolent protection, so by 1623 about 80 settlers lived on the eastern shore.Wise at p.34-38 Debedeavon favored Savage and gave him a large tract of land that is still today known as \\"Savage's Neck\\". In his later years, Debedeavon devoted himself to the pleasures of hunting, leaving much of the business of government to his brother and Prime Minister, Kiptopeke. Indeed, when some prowling Indians up the coast killed an Englishman and boy, Debedeavon sent peace ambassadors, which Col. Obedience Robins refused to use as human sacrifices, but instead sent back, although Daniel Cugley, who had married the widowed Hannah Tyng, set them to work on his plantation, which caused his arrest and being sent to Jamestown for trial. Furthermore, when a quarrelsome settler pointed a gun at Debedeavon, the Accawmacke shire Court (Capt. Edmun Scarburgh, Justice of the Peace) ordered \\"that for any future tyme, noe Englishman shall disturb, molest, or act anything ag'st the sd Indyan King to hindr him in his huntinge, as they will answer the same.Wise p. 55-56.

The formation was created in February 1907, when the Home Fleet (Heimatflotte) was renamed as the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was the architect of the fleet; he envisioned a force powerful enough to challenge the Royal Navy's predominance. Kaiser Wilhelm II, the German Emperor, championed the fleet as the instrument by which he would seize overseas possessions and make Germany a global power. By concentrating a powerful battle fleet in the North Sea while the Royal Navy was required to disperse its forces around the British Empire, Tirpitz believed Germany could achieve a balance of force that could seriously damage British naval hegemony. This was the heart of Tirpitz's \\"Risk Theory\\", which held that Britain would not challenge Germany if the latter's fleet posed such a significant threat to its own. The primary component of the Fleet was its battleships, typically organized in eight-ship squadrons, though it also contained various other formations, including the I Scouting Group. At its creation in 1907, the High Seas Fleet consisted of two squadrons of battleships, and by 1914, a third squadron had been added. The dreadnought revolution in 1906 greatly affected the composition of the fleet; the twenty- four pre-dreadnoughts in the fleet were rendered obsolete and required replacement. Enough dreadnoughts for two full squadrons were completed by the outbreak of war in mid 1914; the eight most modern pre-dreadnoughts were used to constitute a third squadron. Two additional squadrons of older vessels were mobilized at the onset of hostilities, though by the end of the conflict, these formations were disbanded. The fleet conducted a series of sorties into the North Sea during the war designed to lure out an isolated portion of the numerically superior British Grand Fleet. These operations frequently used the fast battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to raid the British coast as the bait for the Royal Navy. These operations culminated in the Battle of Jutland, on 31 May‚Äì1 June 1916, where the High Seas Fleet confronted the whole of the Grand Fleet. The battle was inconclusive, but the British won strategically, as it convinced Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the German fleet commander, that even a highly favorable outcome to a fleet action would not secure German victory in the war. Scheer and other leading admirals therefore advised the Kaiser to order a resumption of the unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. The primary responsibility of the High Seas Fleet in 1917 and 1918 was to secure the German naval bases in the North Sea for U-boat operations. Nevertheless, the fleet continued to conduct sorties into the North Sea and detached units for special operations in the Baltic Sea against the Russian Baltic Fleet. Following the German defeat in November 1918, the Allies interned the bulk of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow, where it was ultimately scuttled by its crews in June 1919, days before the belligerents signed the Treaty of Versailles. Creation Alfred von Tirpitz In 1898, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz became the State Secretary for the Imperial Navy Office (Reichsmarineamt‚ÄîRMA);Herwig, p. 33 Tirpitz was an ardent supporter of naval expansion. During a speech in support of the First Naval Law on 6 December 1897, Tirpitz stated that the navy was \\"a question of survival\\" for Germany.Herwig, p. 35 He also viewed Great Britain, with its powerful Royal Navy, as the primary threat to Germany. In a discussion with the Kaiser during his first month in his post as State Secretary, he stated that \\"for Germany the most dangerous naval enemy at present is England.\\"Herwig, p. 36 Tirpitz theorized that an attacking fleet would require a 33 percent advantage in strength to achieve victory, and so decided that a 2:3 ratio would be required for the German navy. For a final total of 60 German battleships, Britain would be required to build 90 to meet the 2:3 ratio envisioned by Tirpitz. The Royal Navy had heretofore adhered to the so-called \\"two-power standard\\", first formulated in the Naval Defence Act of 1889, which required a larger fleet than those of the next two largest naval powers combined.Sondhaus, pp. 160‚Äì161 The crux of Tirpitz's \\"risk theory\\" was that by building a fleet to the 2:3 ratio, Germany would be strong enough that even in the event of a British naval victory, the Royal Navy would incur damage so serious as to allow the third-ranked naval power to rise to preeminence. Implicit in Tirpitz's theory was the assumption that the British would adopt an offensive strategy that would allow the Germans to use mines and submarines to even the numerical odds before fighting a decisive battle between Heligoland and the Thames. Tirpitz in fact believed Germany would emerge victorious from a naval struggle with Britain, as he believed Germany to possess superior ships manned by better- trained crews, more effective tactics, and led by more capable officers. In his first program, Tirpitz envisioned a fleet of nineteen battleships, divided into two eight-ship squadrons, one ship as a flagship, and two in reserve. The squadrons were further divided into four-ship divisions. This would be supported by the eight - and es of coastal defense ships, six large and eighteen small cruisers, and twelve divisions of torpedo boats, all assigned to the Home Fleet (Heimatflotte).Padfield, p. 45 This fleet was secured by the First Naval Law, which passed in the Reichstag on 28 March 1898.Gardiner & Gray, p. 134 Construction of the fleet was to be completed by 1 April 1904. Rising international tensions, particularly as a result of the outbreak of the Boer War in South Africa and the Boxer Rebellion in China, allowed Tirpitz to push through an expanded fleet plan in 1900. The Second Naval Law was passed on 14 June 1900; it doubled the size of the fleet to 38 battleships and 20 large and 38 small cruisers. Tirpitz planned an even larger fleet. As early as September 1899, he had informed the Kaiser that he sought at least 45 battleships, and potentially might secure a third double-squadron, for a total strength of 48 battleships.Herwig, p. 42 =Naval arms race= Admiral John Fisher During the initial period of German naval expansion, Britain did not feel particularly threatened. The Lords of the Admiralty felt the implications of the Second Naval Law were not a significantly more dangerous threat than the fleet set by the First Naval Law; they believed it was more important to focus on the practical situation rather than speculation on future programs that might easily be reduced or cut entirely. Segments of the British public, however, quickly seized on the perceived threat posed by the German construction programs.Padfield, p. 94 Despite their dismissive reaction, the Admiralty resolved to surpass German battleship construction. Admiral John Fisher, who became the First Sea Lord and head of the Admiralty in 1904, introduced sweeping reforms in large part to counter the growing threat posed by the expanding German fleet. Training programs were modernized, old and obsolete vessels were discarded, and the scattered squadrons of battleships were consolidated into four main fleets, three of which were based in Europe. Britain also made a series of diplomatic arrangements, including an alliance with Japan that allowed a greater concentration of British battleships in the North Sea.Herwig, pp. 48‚Äì49 Fisher's reforms caused serious problems for Tirpitz's plans; he counted on a dispersal of British naval forces early in a conflict that would allow Germany's smaller but more concentrated fleet to achieve a local superiority. Tirpitz could also no longer depend on the higher level of training in both the German officer corps and the enlisted ranks, nor the superiority of the more modern and homogenized German squadrons over the heterogeneous British fleet. In 1904, Britain signed the Entente cordiale with France, Britain's primary naval rival. The destruction of two Russian fleets during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905 further strengthened Britain's position, as it removed the second of her two traditional naval rivals.Herwig, p. 49 These developments allowed Britain to discard the \\"two power standard\\" and focus solely on out-building Germany. In October 1906, Admiral Fisher stated \\"our only probable enemy is Germany. Germany keeps her whole Fleet always concentrated within a few hours of England. We must therefore keep a Fleet twice as powerful concentrated within a few hours of Germany.\\"Herwig, p. 50 The most damaging blow to Tirpitz's plan came with the launch of in February 1906. The new battleship, armed with a main battery of ten guns, was considerably more powerful than any battleship afloat. Ships capable of battle with Dreadnought would need to be significantly larger than the old pre- dreadnoughts, which increased their cost and necessitated expensive dredging of canals and harbors to accommodate them. The German naval budget was already stretched thin; without new funding, Tirpitz would have to abandon his challenge to Britain.Herwig, pp. 56‚Äì57 As a result, Tirpitz went before the Reichstag in May 1906 with a request for additional funding. The First Amendment to the Second Naval Law was passed on 19 May and appropriated funding for the new battleships, as well as for the dredging required by their increased size. underway, circa 1906‚Äì1907 The Reichstag passed a second amendment to the Naval Law in March 1908 to provide an additional billion marks to cope with the growing cost of the latest battleships. The law also reduced the service life of all battleships from 25 to 20 years, which allowed Tirpitz to push for the replacement of older vessels earlier. A third and final amendment was passed in May 1912 represented a compromise between Tirpitz and moderates in parliament. The amendment authorized three new battleships and two light cruisers. The amendment called for the High Seas Fleet to be equipped with three squadrons of eight battleships each, one squadron of eight battlecruisers, and eighteen light cruisers. Two 8-ship squadrons would be placed in reserve, along with two armored and twelve light cruisers.Gardiner & Gray, p. 135 By the outbreak of war in August 1914, only one eight-ship squadron of dreadnoughts‚Äîthe I Battle Squadron‚Äîhad been assembled with the and s. The second squadron of dreadnoughts‚Äîthe III Battle Squadron‚Äîwhich included four of the s, was only completed when the four s entered service by early 1915.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 145‚Äì147 As a result, the third squadron‚Äîthe II Battle Squadron remained composed of pre-dreadnoughts through 1916.Gardiner & Gray, p. 141 Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany attempted to reach a compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned the idea of a decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact to be used as a bargaining chip in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 135‚Äì136 Strategy Prewar photo of the High Seas Fleet‚Äîa member of the leads the line The German Navy's pre-war planning held that the British would be compelled to mount either a direct attack on the German coast to defeat the High Seas Fleet, or to put in place a close blockade. Either course of action would permit the Germans to whittle away at the numerical superiority of the Grand Fleet with submarines and torpedo boats. Once a rough equality of forces could be achieved, the High Seas Fleet would be able to attack and destroy the British fleet.Tarrant, p. 21 Implicit in Tirpitz's strategy was the assumption that German vessels were better-designed, had better-trained crews, and would be employed with superior tactics. In addition, Tirpitz assumed that Britain would not be able to concentrate its fleet in the North Sea, owing to the demands of its global empire. At the start of a conflict between the two powers, the Germans would therefore be able to attack the Royal Navy with local superiority.Herwig, pp. 36‚Äì37 The British, however, did not accommodate Tirpitz's projections; from his appointment as the First Sea Lord in 1904, Fisher began a major reorganization of the Royal Navy. He concentrated British battleship strength in home waters, launched the Dreadnought revolution, and introduced rigorous training for the fleet personnel.Herwig, p. 92 In 1912, the British concluded a joint defense agreement with France that allowed the British to concentrate in the North Sea while the French defended the Mediterranean.Herwig, p. 79 Worse still, the British began developing the strategy of the distant blockade of Germany starting in 1904;Lambert, p. 39 this removed the ability of German light craft to reduce Britain's superiority in numbers and essentially invalidated German naval planning before the start of World War I.Herwig, p. 149‚Äì150 Logistics and personnel The I and II Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet in Kiel The primary base for the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea was Wilhelmshaven on the western side of the Jade Bight; the port of Cuxhaven, located on the mouth of the Elbe, was also a major base in the North Sea. The island of Heligoland provided a fortified forward position in the German Bight.Halpern, p. 10 Kiel was the most important base in the Baltic, which supported the forward bases at Pillau and Danzig.Halpern, p. 182 The Kaiser Wilhelm Canal through Schleswig-Holstein connected the Baltic and North Seas and allowed the German Navy to quickly shift naval forces between the two seas.Halpern, p. 179 In peacetime, all ships on active duty in the High Seas Fleet were stationed in Wilhelmshaven, Kiel, or Danzig.Herwig, p. 114 Germany possessed only one major overseas base, at Kiautschou in China,Herwig, pp. 104‚Äì105 where the East Asia Squadron was stationed.Halpern, p. 66 Steam ships of the period, which burned coal to fire their boilers, were naturally tied to coaling stations in friendly ports. The German Navy lacked sufficient overseas bases for sustained operations, even for single ships operating as commerce raiders.Halpern, p. 67 The Navy experimented with a device to transfer coal from colliers to warships while underway in 1907, though the practice was not put into general use.\\"New Apparatus for Coaling Warships\\", pp. 65‚Äì66 Nevertheless, German capital ships had a cruising range of at least ,Gr√∂ner, pp. 23‚Äì28, 52‚Äì56 more than enough to operate in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1897, the year Tirpitz came to his position as State Secretary of the Navy Office, the Imperial Navy consisted of a total of around 26,000 officers, petty officers, and enlisted men of various ranks, branches, and positions. By the outbreak of war in 1914, this had increased significantly to about 80,000 officers, petty officers, and men.Herwig, p. 111 Capital ships were typically commanded by a Kapit√§n zur See (Captain at Sea) or Korvettenkapit√§n (corvette captain). Each of these ships typically had a total crew in excess of 1,000 officers and men; the light cruisers that screened for the fleet had crew sizes between 300 and 550.Gr√∂ner, pp. 104‚Äì115 The fleet torpedo boats had crews of about 80 to 100 officers and men, though some later classes approached 200.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 164‚Äì172 History , the first flagship of the High Seas Fleet In early 1907, enough battleships‚Äîof the and es‚Äîhad been constructed to allow for the creation of a second full squadron.Herwig, p. 45 On 16 February 1907,Staff (Vol. 1), p. 7 Kaiser Wilhelm renamed the Home Fleet the High Seas Fleet. Admiral Prince Heinrich of Prussia, Wilhelm II's brother, became the first commander of the High Seas Fleet; his flagship was . While on a peacetime footing, the Fleet conducted a routine pattern of training exercises, with individual ships, with squadrons, and with the combined fleet, throughout the year. The entire fleet conducted several cruises into the Atlantic Ocean and the Baltic Sea.Staff (Vol. 1), pp. 7‚Äì8 Prince Henry was replaced in late 1909 by Vice Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff, who served until April 1913. Vice Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, who would command the High Seas Fleet in the first months of World War I, took command following the departure of Vice Admiral von Holtzendorff.Herwig, p. 262 replaced Deutschland as the fleet flagship on 2 March 1913.Staff (Vol. 2), p. 14 Despite the rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand on 28 June, the High Seas Fleet began its summer cruise to Norway on 13 July. During the last peacetime cruise of the Imperial Navy, the fleet conducted drills off Skagen before proceeding to the Norwegian fjords on 25 July. The following day the fleet began to steam back to Germany, as a result of Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. On the 27th, the entire fleet assembled off Cape Skudenes before returning to port, where the ships remained at a heightened state of readiness. War between Austria-Hungary and Serbia broke out the following day, and in the span of a week all of the major European powers had joined the conflict.Heyman, p. xix =World War I= , the second flagship of the High Seas Fleet The High Seas Fleet conducted a number of sweeps and advances into the North Sea. The first occurred on 2‚Äì3 November 1914, though no British forces were encountered. Admiral von Ingenohl, the commander of the High Seas Fleet, adopted a strategy in which the battlecruisers of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's I Scouting Group raided British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet.Herwig, pp. 149‚Äì150 The raid on Scarborough, Hartlepool and Whitby on 15‚Äì16 December 1914 was the first such operation.Tarrant, p. 31 On the evening of 15 December, the German battle fleet of some twelve dreadnoughts and eight pre-dreadnoughts came to within of an isolated squadron of six British battleships. However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens in the darkness convinced von Ingenohl that he was faced with the entire Grand Fleet. Under orders from the Kaiser to avoid risking the fleet unnecessarily, von Ingenohl broke off the engagement and turned the fleet back toward Germany.Tarrant, pp. 31‚Äì33 Following the loss of at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915, the Kaiser removed Admiral von Ingenohl from his post on 2 February. Admiral Hugo von Pohl replaced him as commander of the fleet.Tarrant, pp. 43‚Äì44 Admiral von Pohl conducted a series of fleet advances in 1915; in the first one on 29‚Äì30 March, the fleet steamed out to the north of Terschelling and returned without incident. Another followed on 17‚Äì18 April, where the fleet covered a mining operation by the II Scouting Group. Three days later, on 21‚Äì22 April, the High Seas Fleet advanced towards the Dogger Bank, though again failed to meet any British forces.Staff (Vol. 2), p. 15 Another sortie followed on 29‚Äì30 May, during which the fleet advanced as far as Schiermonnikoog before being forced to turn back by inclement weather. On 10 August, the fleet steamed to the north of Heligoland to cover the return of the auxiliary cruiser . A month later, on 11‚Äì12 September, the fleet covered another mine-laying operation off the Swarte Bank. The last operation of the year, conducted on 23‚Äì24 October, was an advance without result in the direction of Horns Reef. Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer became Commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet on 18 January 1916 when Admiral von Pohl became too ill to continue in that post.Sweetman, p. 394 Scheer favored a much more aggressive policy than that of his predecessor, and advocated greater usage of U-boats and zeppelins in coordinated attacks on the Grand Fleet; Scheer received approval from the Kaiser in February 1916 to carry out his intentions.Tarrant, p. 50 Scheer ordered the fleet on sweeps of the North Sea on 26 March, 2‚Äì3 April, and 21‚Äì22 April. The battlecruisers conducted another raid on the English coast on 24‚Äì25 April, during which the fleet provided distant support.Staff (Vol. 2), p. 11 Scheer planned another raid for mid-May, but the battlecruiser had struck a mine during the previous raid and the repair work forced the operation to be pushed back until the end of the month.Tarrant, p. 58 Battle of Jutland A K√∂nig-class battleship firing her main guns at Jutland, by Claus Bergen Admiral Scheer's fleet, composed of 16 dreadnoughts, six pre-dreadnoughts, six light cruisers, and 31 torpedo boats departed the Jade early on the morning of 31 May. The fleet sailed in concert with Hipper's five battlecruisers and supporting cruisers and torpedo boats.Tarrant, p. 62 The Royal Navy's Room 40 had intercepted and decrypted German radio traffic containing plans of the operation. The Admiralty ordered the Grand Fleet, totaling some 28 dreadnoughts and 9 battlecruisers, to sortie the night before in order to cut off and destroy the High Seas Fleet.Tarrant, pp. 63‚Äì64 At 16:00 UTC, the two battlecruiser forces encountered each other and began a running gun fight south, back towards Scheer's battle fleet.Campbell, p. 34 Upon reaching the High Seas Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers turned back to the north to lure the Germans towards the rapidly approaching Grand Fleet, under the command of Admiral John Jellicoe.Bennet, p. 73 During the run to the north, Scheer's leading ships engaged the s of the 5th Battle Squadron.Tarrant, p. 116 By 18:30, the Grand Fleet had arrived on the scene, and was deployed into a position that would cross Scheer's \\"T\\" from the northeast. To extricate his fleet from this precarious position, Scheer ordered a 16-point turn to the south-west.Tarrant, p. 153 At 18:55, Scheer decided to conduct another 16-point turn to launch an attack on the British fleet.Tarrant, p. 165 This maneuver again put Scheer in a dangerous position; Jellicoe had turned his fleet south and again crossed Scheer's \\"T\\".Bennett, p. 106 A third 16-point turn followed; Hipper's mauled battlecruisers charged the British line to cover the retreat.Tarrant, pp. 177‚Äì181 Scheer then ordered the fleet to adopt the night cruising formation, which was completed by 23:40.Campbell, p. 275 A series of ferocious engagements between Scheer's battleships and Jellicoe's destroyer screen ensued, though the Germans managed to punch their way through the destroyers and make for Horns Reef.Campbell, p. 274 The High Seas Fleet reached the Jade between 13:00 and 14:45 on 1 June; Scheer ordered the undamaged battleships of the I Battle Squadron to take up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead while the Kaiser-class battleships were to maintain a state of readiness just outside Wilhelmshaven.Tarrant, p. 263 The High Seas Fleet had sunk more British vessels than the Grand Fleet had sunk German, though Scheer's leading battleships had taken a terrible hammering. Several capital ships, including , which had been the first vessel in the line, and most of the battlecruisers, were in drydock for extensive repairs for at least two months. On 1 June, the British had twenty-four capital ships in fighting condition, compared to only ten German warships.Halpern, p. 327 Subsequent operations The High Seas Fleet in Kiel bay By August, enough warships had been repaired to allow Scheer to undertake another fleet operation on 18‚Äì19 August. Due to the serious damage incurred by Seydlitz and and the loss of at Jutland, the only battlecruisers available for the operation were and , which were joined by , , and the new battleship .Staff (Vol. 2), p. 35 Scheer turned north after receiving a false report from a zeppelin about a British unit in the area. As a result, the bombardment was not carried out, and by 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and so turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.Massie, p. 683 Another fleet sortie took place on 18‚Äì19 October 1916 to attack enemy shipping east of Dogger Bank. Despite being forewarned by signal intelligence, the Grand Fleet did not attempt to intercept. The operation was however cancelled due to poor weather after the cruiser was torpedoed by the British submarine .Beesly, p. 167 The fleet was reorganized on 1 December; the four K√∂nig-class battleships remained in the III Squadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships were transferred to the IV Squadron.Halpern, p. 214 In March 1917 the new battleship , built to serve as fleet flagship, entered service;Staff (Vol. 2), p. 43 on the 17th, Scheer hauled down his flag from Friedrich der Grosse and transferred it to Baden. The war, now in its fourth year, was by 1917 taking its toll on the crews of the ships of the High Seas Fleet. Acts of passive resistance, such as the posting of anti-war slogans in the battleships and in January 1917, began to appear.Woodward, pp. 66‚Äì67 In June and July, the crews began to conduct more active forms of resistance. These activities included work refusals, hunger strikes, and taking unauthorized leave from their ships.Woodward, pp. 70‚Äì72 The disruptions came to a head in August, when a series of protests, anti-war speeches, and demonstrations resulted in the arrest of dozens of sailors.Woodward, pp. 72‚Äì73 Scheer ordered the arrest of over 200 men from the battleship , the center of the anti-war activities. A series of courts-martial followed, which resulted in 77 guilty verdicts; nine men were sentenced to death for their roles, though only two men, Albin K√∂bis and Max Reichpietsch, were executed.Woodward, p. 77 Movements of the German fleet during Operation Albion In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of Riga, the German navy decided to eliminate the Russian naval forces that still held the Gulf of Riga. The Navy High Command (Admiralstab) planned an operation, codenamed Operation Albion, to seize the Baltic island of √ñsel, and specifically the Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula.Halpern, p. 213 On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture √ñsel and Moon Islands; the primary naval component was to comprise its flagship, Moltke, and the III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet.Halpern, pp. 214‚Äì215 The operation began on the morning of 12 October, when Moltke and the III Squadron ships engaged Russian positions in Tagga Bay while the IV Squadron shelled Russian gun batteries on the Sworbe Peninsula on √ñsel.Halpern, p. 215 By 20 October, the fighting on the islands was winding down; Moon, √ñsel, and Dag√∂ were in German possession. The previous day, the Admiralstab had ordered the cessation of naval actions and the return of the dreadnoughts to the High Seas Fleet as soon as possible.Halpern, p. 219 Admiral Scheer had used light surface forces to attack British convoys to Norway beginning in late 1917. As a result, the Royal Navy attached a squadron of battleships to protect the convoys, which presented Scheer with the possibility of destroying a detached squadron of the Grand Fleet. The operation called for Hipper's battlecruisers to attack the convoy and its escorts on 23 April while the battleships of the High Seas Fleet stood by in support. On 22 April, the German fleet assembled in the Schillig Roads outside Wilhelmshaven and departed the following morning.Halpern, p. 418 Despite the success in reaching the convoy route undetected, the operation failed due to faulty intelligence. Reports from U-boats indicated to Scheer that the convoys sailed at the start and middle of each week, but a west-bound convoy had left Bergen on Tuesday the 22nd and an east-bound group left Methil, Scotland, on the 24th, a Thursday. As a result, there was no convoy for Hipper to attack.Halpern, p. 419 Beatty sortied with a force of 31 battleships and four battlecruisers, but was too late to intercept the retreating Germans. The Germans reached their defensive minefields early on 25 April, though approximately off Heligoland Moltke was torpedoed by the submarine ; she successfully returned to port.Halpern, p. 420 =Internment at Scapa Flow= A final fleet action was planned for the end of October 1918, days before the Armistice was to take effect. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer‚Äîby now the Grand Admiral (Grossadmiral) of the fleet‚Äîintended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, despite the expected casualties. However, many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war.Tarrant, pp. 280‚Äì281 On the morning of 29 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on and then on several other battleships mutinied.Tarrant, pp. 281‚Äì282 The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation.Tarrant, p. 282 When informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated \\"I no longer have a navy.\\"Herwig, p. 252 alt=A map designating the locations where the German ships were sunk. Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, were interned in the British naval base of Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions.Herwig, p. 256 The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships.Herwig, pp. 254‚Äì255 Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and enlisted men on each of the capital ships.Herwig, p. 255 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. Out of the interned fleet, only one battleship, Baden, three light cruisers, and eighteen destroyers were saved from sinking by the British harbor personnel. The Royal Navy, initially opposed to salvage operations, decided to allow private firms to attempt to raise the vessels for scrapping.van der Vat, p. 199 Cox and Danks, a company founded by Ernest Cox handled most of the salvage operations, including those of the heaviest vessels raised.van der Vat, pp. 200‚Äì210 After Cox's withdrawal due to financial losses in the early 1930s, Metal Industries Group, Inc. took over the salvage operation for the remaining ships. Five more capital ships were raised, though three‚ÄîSMS K√∂nig, , and SMS Markgraf‚Äîwere too deep to permit raising. They remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow, along with four light cruisers.van der Vat, pp. 210‚Äì214 Legacy The High Seas Fleet, particularly its wartime impotence and ultimate fate, strongly influenced the later German navies, the Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine. Former Imperial Navy officers continued to serve in the subsequent institutions, including Admiral Erich Raeder, Hipper's former chief of staff, who became the commander in chief of the Reichsmarine. Raeder advocated long-range commerce raiding by surface ships, rather than constructing a large surface fleet to challenge the Royal Navy, which he viewed to be a futile endeavor. His initial version of Plan Z, the construction program for the Kriegsmarine in the late 1930s, called for large number of s, long-range light cruisers, and reconnaissance forces for attacking enemy shipping, though he was overruled by Adolf Hitler, who preferred a large fleet of battleships.Gardiner & Chesneau, pp. 218‚Äì220 See also * Organization of the High Seas Fleet at the Battle of Jutland. * Organization of the High Seas Fleet in late October 1918.

The original reaction formed the alkylating agent using an alkene in the presence of a strong acid. center Mechanism and scope The Ritter reaction proceeds by the electrophilic addition of either a carbenium ion or covalent species to the nitrile. The resulting nitrilium ion is hydrolyzed by water to the desired amide. center Primary, secondary, tertiary, and benzylic alcohols, as well as tert-butyl acetate, also successfully react with nitriles in the presence of strong acids to form amides via the Ritter reaction. A wide range of nitriles can be used. In particular, formonitrile (hydrogen cyanide) can be used to prepare formamides, which are useful precursors to isocyanides. Applications The large scale application of the Ritter reaction is in the synthesis of tert-octylamine. An estimated 10,000 tons/y (year: 2000) of this and related lipophilic amines are prepared in this way. Otherwise, the Ritter reaction is most useful in the formation of amines and amides of pharmaceutical interest.

Illustrative is the conversion of isobutylene to tert-butylamine using HCN and sulfuric acid followed by base neutralization. The weight of the salt byproduct is greater than the weight of the amine. In the laboratory, the Ritter reaction suffers from the necessity of an extremely strong acid catalyst. Other methods have been proposed in order to promote carbocation formation, including photocatalytic electron transfer or direct photolysis. History The reaction is named after John J.

Origins The site was the location of a twelfth-century fortified house, and the local vineyard was held in high regard as early as the seventh century. The ch√¢teau itself was built by Pierre de Massault in the fifteenth century and was owned by many eminent families over the centuries, but fell into disrepair in recent years. Restoration The ruin was purchased in 1980 by Alain-Dominique Perrin, who was president of Cartier SA from 1975 to 1988. It was listed as a historical monument (Monument historique) in the Base M√©rim√©e on 21 October 1982 and the buildings have been completely restored. The main building is flanked by two round towers and the architectural style blends traditional mediaeval sturdy design with more elegant Renaissance decoration. Perrin has also brought the vineyard, which is the oldest vineyard in southwest France, back into production, working with oenologist and consultant Michel Rolland and soil microbiologist Claude Bourguignon to produce wine from the Malbec grape variety. The Ch√¢teau Lagr√©zette wine Le Pigeonnier (100% Malbec) was voted as one of the best 100 wines by Wine Spectator magazine in 2005. The ch√¢teau has entertained a number of eminent visitors in recent years. In 1984 Perrin founded the Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain, and guests have included the sculptor C√©sar Baldaccini, painters Robert Combas and Jean-Charles Blais, photographer Herb Ritts, as well as Elton John, Helmut Newton, Lou Reed, Dennis Hopper, Wim Wenders and David Lynch.

In 2008, realizing the need for the adoption of best practices and standards for managing the storage of digital content through a set of metadata framework, Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) organized an industry roundtable, where Mediacorp chaired the Metadata Standardization Subgroup, working with other industry players, such as Disney and Ascent Media to define a set of best practices for metadata used in the local media industry. Initially, SMMCore was built on the foundation of PBCore. However, with its second revision in 2011, harmonization work has been carried out with European Broadcasting Union (EBU), where the SMMCore framework has been revised to be built on the foundation of the EBUCore. The benefits of harmonization are multiple: support from a larger metadata community of experts, access to knowledge on semantic web and linked data for which EBU and therefore SMMCore are ready, adoption by the industry, sharing resources in research, development and maintenance of the metadata specifications.  Scope  The subgroup identifies seven groups of first level elements, which are, * Identifier Group - e.g., smmcoreIdentifier, smmcoreSource * Title group - e.g., smmcoreTitle,smmcoreAlternateTtile,smmcoreVersion * Description group ‚Äì e.g., smmcoreDescription * Audience Group ‚Äì e.g., smmcoreAudience (genre, rating) * Rights Group ‚Äì e.g., smmcoreRights(rights,rightsLink,rightsHolder,coverage,rightsId,rightsClearanceFlag,contactDetails) * Instantiation Group ‚Äì e.g., smmcoreFormat(fileInfo,videoFormat,audioFormat,subtitleFormat) * Others Group ‚Äì e.g., smmcoreAssociateData,smmcoreAssetData,smmcorePublicationHistory,smmcoreContributor A common library of basic attributes groups and derived data types are defined as well.

He was elected to the Finnish Parliament in the 2011 general election held on 17 April on the electoral list of the Finns Party, but since 2013 he has represented Change 2011. Personal background Hirvisaari is a former train driver, educated at the Helsinki Pasila engine drivers' school in 1980‚Äì1982. He was admitted to University of Helsinki in 1999 to study theology, and is still registered as an undergraduate student. Hirvisaari undertook his military national service in the Kymi Anti-Aircraft Battalion in 1979‚Äì1980 in the city of Kouvola. Politics During his 2011 election campaign Hirvisaari was critical of the immigration policies in Finland (\\"Maahanmuutto hallintaan! ‚Äì Immigration under control!), and supported national sovereignty (\\"Riitt√§√§, ett√§ kansalaiset ovat sit√§ mielt√§ ‚Äì muita perusteluja ei tarvita.\\" ‚Äì \\"It is enough that the citizens are of that opinion ‚Äì no other arguments are needed.\\") as well as Finland generally as a country (\\"Suomen kieli ‚Äì Suomen mieli ‚Äì Suomen luonto ‚Äì Suomen lippu\\" ‚Äì \\"Finnish language ‚Äì Finnish mindset ‚Äì Finnish nature ‚Äì Finnish flag\\"). In July 2011 Hirvisaari stated that the killings in Oslo on 22 July 2011, by right-wing extremist Anders Behring Breivik, were a side-effect of Norway's immigration policies. Just before the 2011 general election Hirvisaari was prosecuted for his blog in the Uusi Suomi newspaper web site under the title \\"Kikkarap√§√§lle kuonoon\\".The text can be read here (in Finnish): http://jam.pp.fi/kikkarapaalle_kuonoon.htm The text referenced an attack on a foreign person in Helsinki ‚Äî Hirvisaari wrote that the crime had not necessarily been a racist one. In November 2010 the district court of P√§ij√§t-H√§me dropped the charges against him of incitement. After consultation with the deputy general attorney, Jorma Kalske, the state appealed against the verdict. In December the Kouvola court of appeals found Hirvisaari guilty of incitement and fined him. In October 2013, Speaker of the Parliament Eero Hein√§luoma issued a notice of censure to Hirvisaari for an incident where he had invited far-right activist Seppo Lehto as his guest to the parliament. During his visit, Lehto made several Nazi salutes, including at least one instance where Hirvisaari took a photo of Lehto performing the Nazi salute from the spectator gallery overlooking the Parliament House's Session Hall. Photos and videos of Lehto performing the Nazi salute in the Parliament House were then distributed on Lehto's public Facebook page and on YouTube. The Finns Party leadership then unanimously decided to expel Hirvisaari from the party, citing multiple cases of acting against the party's interest. After his expulsion from the Finns Party Hirvisaari joined Change 2011, becoming that party's first MP. In the 2015 parliamentary elections Hirvisaari was a candidate for the Muutos 2011 party on the Uusimaa electoral district, but did not gather enough votes to be elected. Suomen Sisu The board of the Finnish nationalist association Suomen Sisu congratulated Hirvisaari for his election to the Finnish parliament and referred to him as \\"one of its members\\". In 2013 Hirvisaari resigned his membership in Suomen Sisu, but he rejoined the organisation in 2014. Nuiva manifesti James Hirvisaari was one of the authors of the so-called \\"Nuiva Manifesti\\" (\\"The sour electoral manifesto\\"), an election campaign programme critical of current Finnish immigration policy.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church stands to the south of the B3400 road and the River Test, some east of Whitchurch. History The presence of a church on the site was recorded in the Domesday Book, but the present church dates from the 13th century. The windows and chancel screen were added in the 15th century. In 1703 the interior of the church was remodelled. During the 19th century the parish of Freefolk was united with that of Laverstoke. In 1896 a new, larger church was built to the north, on the other side of the road, and the functions of St Nicholas were transferred to this church, St Mary's, Laverstoke. St Nicholas was declared redundant on 11 December 1974 and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 27 October 1976. Architecture =Exterior= The church consists of a single rectangular cell measuring by . It is constructed in stone rubble with stone dressings. Its walls are partly rendered, and are supported by brick buttresses. The roof is tiled. At the west end of the roof is a weatherboarded bellcote with a lead-covered pyramidal roof. The windows are Perpendicular in style, those on the sides (two on the north, three on the south) having a single light, the west window has two lights and the east window three lights. On the south side is a doorway, above which is a plaque bearing the date 1703. =Interior= Around the interior of the church is a moulded cornice dating from 1703. On the east wall of the church, on each side of the altar, are painted boards containing the Lord's prayer and the Creed, and on the south wall is a large board inscribed with the Ten Commandments. On the north wall, opposite the south door, are three layers of wall paintings. To the east of this is the large Jacobean monument to Sir Richard Powlett who died in 1614. This consists of a recumbent effigy on a tomb chest. Two figures kneeling at the front represent his two daughters.Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, The kings England, Arthur Mee. Published 1939.

He is best known for his exploration of Karafuto which is now known as Sakhalin. He mapped areas of North East Asia which weren't known yet. Biography Mamiya was born in 1775 in Tsukuba District, Hitachi Province, in what is now Tsukubamirai, Ibaraki Prefecture. Later in his life he would become an undercover agent for the Tokugawa shogunate. He is best known for his exploration and mapping of Sakhalin (known to the Japanese as Ê®∫Â§™, Karafuto), which resulted in his discovery that Sakhalin was indeed an island and not connected to the Asian continent, although this had already been discovered by Jean-Fran√ßois de La P√©rouse in 1787, who charted most of the Strait of Tartary. The strait would later be named after him in Japan as the Mamiya Strait. In 1785 Japanese explorers reached almost to the Strait of Tartary on the west, Cape Patience on the east and Urup in the Kurils. In 1808 Mamiya sailed up the east coast and Matsuda Denjuro up the west coast. From near Cape Patience Mamiya crossed the mountains to join Matsuda. The next year Mamiya sailed into the mouth of the Amur River and reached a Chinese trading post. In 1852 Mamiya's maps were published in Europe by Philipp Franz von Siebold. Although Japan believed that Mamiya had no child, it was announced in 2002 that there was a daughter of him and an Ainu woman and her descendants remained alive in Hokkaido. In popular culture Mamiya is portrayed as one of the two main villains in the manga series Shin Kozure Okami (New Lone Wolf and Cub). In this version, he is the chief henchman of Matsudaira Nobutsuna (and his natural son) and a master of disguise who assumes different identities after murdering the original persons. He is also possibly even more ruthless that Matsudaira, subverting various ninja groups for his own use and using opium as a means of ensnaring and controlling various people, including the Shogun. While Mamiya's historical explorations are mentioned, in this version they have been for a more malign purpose than mere exploration.

Bailey's earlier works ‚Äì Ipi Zombi, iMumbo Jumbo and The Prophet ‚Äì are grouped together under the title Plays of Miracle and Wonder (which is the title of a book on Bailey's plays) and incorporate ceremony and sacrament. These works are aggressive with Bailey using drums, screams, knives and broken glass to break down the audiences' defences. In Ipi Zombi, Bailiey evoked a 1996 witch-hunt in which several women were blamed and killed for the death of twelve boys in a minivan accident. It combined Xhosa and Christian ritual. Author Zakes Mda claimed Ipi Zombi to be a \\"A work of genius that maps out a path to a new South African theatre ...\\" In other works, such as Orfeus, Bailey takes a softer approach, and looks to highlight the blind, forgotten, the broken and the voiceless. In Orfeus, specifically, the audience is drawn down into an African underworld that is governed by a seedy businessman. Orfeus, and other works, look at a post-colonial, showing a \\"decaying globalised world in which not only shamanic rituals but also moving music create an entirely unique African atmosphere\\". First staged in 2004 in Bern, Switzerland, House of The Holy Afro has been repeatedly staged in Europe and Australia with its last iteration at the Market Theatre Laboratory, Johannesburg, in June 2010. Performer and drag diva, Odidi Mfenyana plays the high priest of the holy house, and leads the performance through an urban funk cabaret that borders on spiritual ritual.Matthew Krouse, \\"'Odidiva' climbs the stairway to heaven\\", Mail and Guardian, 18 June 2010. Retrieved 15 July 2011. In the site-specific work medEia, the audience walked in silence for at least ten-minutes before the production. The audience's emotional and intellectual journey through works were physically manifest in the installations Blood Diamonds: Terminal and Exhibit A: Deutsch Sudwestafrika. Exhibit A: Deutsch-S√ºdwestafrika, staged in the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna's Hofburg Palace, is a \\"meditation on the dark history of European Racism in relation to Africa\\". For the 4th World Summit on Arts and Culture, Bailey presented 3 Colours ‚Äì a one-off mixed media performance piece. Bailey collaborated with award-winning choreographer Gregory Maqoma and Congolese musician Mapumba Cilombo. The piece represented the complexities of inter-culturalism, in which Bailey \\"chose to portray different societies or cultures symbolically as shrines. Indefinable as they are, our cultures are sacred to us. At the heart of each glows a unique cluster of precious jewels; our myths and histories, our heritage, our values and social structure, our cosmology, and relationship to the ultimate.\\" Bailey's curated the Infecting the City Festival from 2008 until 2011. It is currently Africa's biggest public arts festival that takes place in the public spaces of Cape Town during February or March of every year. During Bailey's tenure, the Festival chose a theme that had social relevance: \\"In a society that has as many complex issues as ours, if one is commandeering the communal spaces of the city, it is not enough merely to provide entertainment for the public. There is a moral imperative to tackle the pressing issues of our day, and to ask artists to apply themselves to these.\\"\\"Art is Contagious\\", www.mahala.co.za, 18 February 2011.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, Gilmore started his Minor leagues career in 1910 with the Denver Grizzlies, playing for them one year before joining the San Francisco Seals (1912), Buffalo Bisons (1912) and Fort Wayne Railroaders (1914). Then, in 1914 he joined the Kansas City Packers of the outlaw Federal League. Gilmore became a regular outfielder for the Packers during the last two seasons of the league. He was solid in his season debut, batting a .287 average with 23 stolen bases, driving in 32 runs while scoring 91 more. His only negative was that he became the first rookie batter to log 100 strikeouts in a single season, whiffing 108 times.

She was the fifth ship of the Royal Navy to be named after the River Trent. She was renamed HMS Pembroke in 1905, and served off the coast of Tanganyika in 1915. She was renamed HMS Gannet in 1917 while serving as a diving tender. She was scrapped in 1923. Design The Medina class were a development of the Rendel (or \\"flat-iron\\") gunboat, a series of small vessels with low freeboards which mounted a small number of relatively large guns. Although the Medinas were exceptionally provided with masts to extend their range and independence, in essence they were available for similar operations to their un-masted sisters; offensive action against shore defences.

The architectural firm Kallmann McKinnell & Knowles designed the plaza in 1962 to accompany Boston's new City Hall building. The multi-level, irregularly shaped plaza consists of red brick and concrete. The Government Center MBTA station is located beneath the plaza; its entrance is at the southwest corner of the plaza.  History  City Hall Plaza in 1973 The siting of the plaza, the City Hall, and other structures in Government Center was the responsibility of I. M. Pei, commissioned by Edward J. Logue, then development administrator of the Boston Redevelopment Authority. The plaza and City Hall were constructed between 1963 and 1968, on the former site of Scollay Square, which despite its vibrancy and historical interest, was considered a seedy area by some. Other streets removed to make way for the plaza included Brattle Street and Cornhill. Two historic buildings formerly on Cornhill, known as the Sears' Crescent and Sears' Block, were not demolished and now face the southern edge of the plaza. The 1962 design was reportedly modeled after Piazza del Campo in Siena, Italy. Reaction to the plaza has been mixed. Some praise City Hall Plaza for being cleaner and more appealing than Scollay Square, and for the simple fact that it was built at all‚Äîwith the cooperation and compromises necessary of any complex, multi-agency government construction project. Architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable called the plaza \\"one of the best urban spaces of the 20th century. ... With the plaza, and specifically because of it, the Boston Government Center can now take its place among the world's great city spaces.\\" The Cultural Landscape Foundation listed the plaza as one of its \\"Marvels of Modernism.\\" The original fountain in 1973 Others dislike City Hall PlazaThe good city: writers explore 21st century Boston. 2004; p.4. for its anti-social aesthetic and failure to address unpleasant weather effects (such as wintertime cold, wet, and wind, and summertime heat, dust, sun, and wind). The Project for Public Spaces ranked it at the top of the organization's list of \\"Squares Most Dramatically in Need of Improvement in the United States\\" in 2005, and has placed the plaza on its \\"Hall of Shame.\\" A fountain was built at the northwest corner of the plaza as part of the original design. But it was shut down in 1977 because water was leaking into the Blue Line subway tunnel below. The fountain was covered over with a concrete slab in 2006. A nonprofit group built a \\"Cancer Garden of Hope\\" at the northeast corner of the plaza in 2010.  Redesign  Since the plaza opened in 1968, ideas for improvements to the public space have been put forth by citizens, students, architects, politicians, and others. In the early 2000s, cellist Yo-Yo Ma proposed the construction of a music garden based on his Inspired by Bach series of recordings. The plan did not move forward in Boston, but was realized as the Toronto Music Garden. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino had several ideas for improvement. In 2007, Emerson College students used the virtual world Second Life to re-imagine a better design. The project was sponsored by the Boston Redevelopment Authority, among others. A 2011 study commissioned by the United States Environmental Protection Agency made recommendations for the \\"greening\\" of the plaza. Work began in 2011 on plans to redesign the plaza and the Government Center MBTA station. The new MBTA station opened in March 2016 after two years of construction. Extensive landscaping and accessibility improvements to the adjacent areas of the plaza were completed in 2017. A year-long study entitled \\"Rethink City Hall\\" was completed in 2017 by the firms Utile and Reed Hilderbrand. The final report called for major changes in City Hall and the plaza. \\"The Patios,\\" a seasonal beer garden, opened in 2018 on a terrace overlooking Congress Street, and was expanded for 2019. In June 2019, the city announced the start of construction of a $70 million project to transform the plaza into a \\"People's Plaza\\" that will include \\"a civic space for all residents, with universal accessibility, new civic spaces for all to use, increased environmental sustainability, and critical infrastructure improvements that will ensure the Plaza is safe and accessible for all for generations to come.\\" The plans, developed by Sasaki Associates, include schematic designs for the project. In January 2020, the Boston Landmarks Commission approved the first phase of the project. Public events 2004 rally to celebrate New England Patriots victory in Super Bowl XXXVIII Nearby Boston Common has long been used for public events, including a 1969 peace rally that drew an estimated crowd of 100,000 and the 1979 mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II. But damage to the park from such large events led city officials to limit future events on the Common, relocating many to the paved City Hall Plaza. Annual events held on City Hall Plaza include Boston Calling Music Festival (2013‚Äì2016), Big Apple Circus, The Jimmy Fund Scooper Bowl, the Boston Pride Festival, the African Festival of Boston, Boston GreenFest, Boston Techjam, the Puerto Rican Festival of Massachusetts, the finish line of Hub on Wheels, and the Boston Cycling Celebration. Occasional events on the plaza have included Boston's 350th birthday celebration, art exhibits such as Strandbeest; large rallies in honor of the New England Patriots, the Boston Red Sox, and the Boston Bruins; political demonstrations; an exhibit of \\"street pianos\\"; beer festivals; HUBweek, a pizza festival, the Boston Night Market, a \\"Roller Disco Tribute Party\\", and the display of a 25-foot-tall statue of King Tut. The Plaza has also been the site for many free concerts including being the original site (before moving to the Hatch Memorial Shell) for WODS (Oldies 103.3) summer concert series such as Chubby Checker and Paul Revere & the Raiders. From December 2016 until February 2017, the Plaza opened an outdoor Skating Path and Holiday Market, as part of an installation called \\"Boston Winter\\". The skating path provided skating lessons for different age groups and planned themed skating events. Boston Winter continued the following year, but did not return in December 2018 as the city prepared for a major renovation of the plaza.

He was one of the few Goan aristocrats who actively opposed the Portuguese colonisation of Goa. During his lifetime, Menezes Bragan√ßa was widely hailed around the Lusosphere (Portuguese speaking world) as \\"O Maior de todos\\" (\\"The Greatest of all [Goans]\\") and in the Indian mainland as \\"The Tilak of Goa\\". Bust of Lu√≠s de Menezes Bragan√ßa in Margao's Municipal Garden  Early life  Lu√≠s de Menezes Bragan√ßa was born as Lu√≠s de Menezes on 15 January 1878 in Chandor, Salcette, to a Chardo family. His mother hailed from the illustrious Bragan√ßa clan of the same village. Later on in life, his maternal grandfather Francis Xavier Bragan√ßa who had no sons, nominated Lu√≠s, his eldest grandson as his heir. Lu√≠s then adopted his maternal surname as his own surname and subsequently became Lu√≠s de Menezes Bragan√ßa. This was contrary to Portuguese custom, whereby the maternal surname is typically followed by the paternal surname. He did his primary education at the Rachol Seminary and then at the Lyceum in Panjim. Although raised a Roman Catholic, Menezes Bragan√ßa later became an agnostic.  The Menezes Braganza house  The Menezes Braganza Pereira house is located at the Chandor village in Goa. It is known to be more than 350 years old and is situated near the church square in Chandor. This mansion is the most exquisite heritage house in the countryside, the biggest in Goa and also has a Portuguese style facade. It is a museum of chandeliers, painting, porcelain, crystal, period furniture and other antique items. According to family history, in the 17th century A.F.S. Braganza Pereira was representing Goa under the Portuguese government as a vice consul general in Spain. He was gifted the land by the king of Portugal, Don Luiz on which the mansion is now located. Later after a few generations, the house was divided into two equal halves as it was inherited by two sisters in the family. It was named after their husbands - Menezes Branganza (west wing) and Braganza Pereira (East wing) and is still inhabited by descendants of the two families. The Portuguese style outer facade that gives entry to both wings of the mansion with 24 windows is the longest in Goa. The house made up of laterite has a garden with mosaic seats, tables and fountains. A nail of St. Francis Xavier is held by the Petite Chapel that is still used in the Braganza Periera House. Two chairs bearing the coat of arms gifted by the Portuguese king are there in the huge ballroom. Aurea is the only living 14th generation and Allan,Andre are the 16th generation of this house \\"https://i.imgur.com/Q69c0oB.jpg\\"  Journalistic career  By the age of twenty, Menezes Bragan√ßa had gained a reputation as a fine writer in the Portuguese language. On 22 January 1900, together with another Goan writer Messias Gomes he co-founded O Heraldo (The Herald), which was the first Portuguese language daily in Goa. His columns in the newspaper were typified by satirical wit, wherein he would attack the Portuguese government and reactionary thinking from Hindu and Catholic intellectuals. Menezes Bragan√ßa was a strong believer in secularism and propounded the ideals of a Secular republic in his columns, prior to the formation of the Portuguese First Republic on 5 October 1910. In 1911, he founded O Debate (The Debate), of which he was the principal editor until 1921. During this period, he also strove to awaken the political consciousness and cultural identity of the Goan people. Menezes Bragan√ßa was a regular contributor to Pracasha (Light), a Konkani language weekly wherein he wrote in great length on subjects such as freedom of thought, freedom of expression and freedom from oppression. His writings provided a great deal of information about the Indian independence movement to the Goan public, and as such, was avidly read by them for news about the Indian mainland. On 1 December 1919, Menezes Bragan√ßa founded another Portuguese language daily Di√°rio de Noite (The Evening News). Like O Debate, this daily also had a wide Goan readership and dealt with the events in the Indian mainland as well as Goan cultural issues.  Activism  Menezes Bragan√ßa was a staunch advocate for the cause of Konkani. In 1914, he began a campaign in defence of the language in O Heraldo, urging its development. In this, he received the wide support of the Goan intelligentsia. He advocated the impartation of primary school education in Konkani, and blamed the Portuguese authorities' preoccupation with denationalisation of the Goan people for its failure to encourage the language. Menezes Bragan√ßa championed the cause of the less privileged sections of Goan society. In 1933, with the coming to power of the Estado Novo regime headed by Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal, he placed himself at the head of the anti-colonialist movement in Goa. After the promulgation of the racist Portuguese Colonial Act in 1930, he proposed a resolution at the Legislative council in Panjim on 3 July of the same year. The resolution upheld the right of self-determination for Goans from the Portuguese rule, and was duly adopted. Menezes Bragan√ßa was the first person to call for an independent Goa and as such, was generally hailed as the \\"father of Goan unrest\\". His brother-in-law Trist√£o de Bragan√ßa Cunha was also a prominent Indian nationalist.  Associations  Menezes Bragan√ßa held many high positions in various organisations during his lifetime. He was elected President of the Municipality of Ilhas, leader of the elected Opposition in the Government Council and Legislative Assembly, President of the Provincial Congress of Goa (1921) and Portuguese India's delegate to the Colonial Conference held in Lisbon in 1924. He was a member of an eminent elite cultural organisation, Instituto Vasco da Gama.  Works  Menezes Bragan√ßa was a prolific author of books. Some of his most notable works are Life of St. Lu√≠s de Gonzaga, Model and Protector of Youth (1893), The Neuter School (1914), The Comunidades and the Cult (1914), The Castes (1915), An Open Letter to Dr. Afonso Costa (1916), A Rev. Master Flayed (1916), India and her Problems (1924), Tourism in Goa (1927), Letter to an innocent (1927), and About an Idea (1928).  Death  Towards the final years of his life, Menezes Bragan√ßa was persecuted by the Estado Novo regime for his outspoken criticism of their government. His demand for the granting of autonomy to Goa was refused, and his newspapers were shut down by order of Salazar. He died on 10 July 1938 in Chandor. Fearing an outbreak of nationalist protests in Goa, the Portuguese government stationed troops at his grave to prevent any homage from being paid to his memory. Legacy At his 25th death anniversary in 1963, the Instituto Vasco da Gama was renamed by its management to Institute Menezes Braganza in honour of his memory. A bust of Bragan√ßa exists in the Institute. Another bust of him is located in the Margao Municipal Garden.http://www.vacationsindia.com/goa/margao.html Professor Dr. Sushila Sawant Mendes has published a book entitled, \\"Luis de Menezes Bragan√ßa: Nationalism, Secularism and free-thought in Portuguese Goa\\".

Early life Clayton was baptized on 9 November 1671, the eldest surviving son of William Clayton of Newmarket, Suffolk and Ann Haske, the daughter of John Haske of Newmarket. He married Charlotte, the daughter of John Dyve, clerk of the Privy Council before 1714.Philip Carter, ‚ÄòClayton , Charlotte, Lady Sundon (c.1679‚Äì1742)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 6 April 2015 Career Clayton entered the Exchequer as clerk of receipts in 1688 and was deputy auditor of receipts by 1714. He was managing the Duke of Marlborough's estates during the Duke's exile and at the accession of George I, his wife was appointed woman of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales on the recommendation of the Duchess of Marlborough. In 1715 the Prince and Princess, tried unsuccessfully to get Clayton made secretary to the Treasury under Walpole, but helped him to obtain a place as paymaster of the King's private pensions instead. Clayton purchased the estates of Sundon in 1716 and was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Woodstock by Marlborough at a by-election on 2 July 1716. The Duke's son-in-law, Lord Sunderland, made him a Lord of the Treasury in 1718. but he was turned out of the post to make room for Walpole's friends on the reunion of the Whig party in 1720. Clayton was elected to the South Sea committee of the House of Commons, and spoke against Walpole's proposals for restoring public credit and discharging a civil list debt in January and July 1721. At the 1722 British general election was defeated at Woodstock but was returned in a contest for St Albans as the Duchess's nominee. Marlborough was dying at this time, and Clayton was one of his executors. In Parliament, Clayton spoke against the Government on a bill for taxing Roman Catholics in 1723, and on the dropping of bounties on wheat exports from Scotland in December 1724. Clayton was appointed auditor general to the Prince of Wales in 1725. In April 1727, he and Pulteney attacked Walpole's proposals for financing a budget deficit. On the accession of George II, with Clayton's connection to the Queen, though his wife, he was reappointed Lord of the Treasury. However he had fallen out with the Duchess of Marlborough through taking office under Walpole, and at the 1727 British general election, he was returned unopposed as MP for Westminster. He spoke for the Government in the 1727 Parliament. He was returned unopposed again for Westminster at the 1734 British general election but thereafter was primarily concerned with his constituency. He was raised to the Peerage of Ireland on 2 June 1735 as Baron Sundon, of Ardagh in the County of Longford. At the 1741 British general election he was returned after a fierce contest, but the partiality of the high bailiff, who prematurely closed the poll, caused a riot and Sundon had to be rescued by the guards. The election was declared void by the House of Commons, which was a serious blow to Walpole's Administration. Clayton's wife, who had suffered bouts of madness since the death of the Queen, died at this time. After the fall of Walpole, Clayton lost his post at the Treasury, but was given a government seat at Plympton Erle where he was returned at a by-election on 3 May 1742. At the 1747 British general election, he was returned for St Mawes, another government seat. Death and legacy Clayton died on 29 April 1752. He had no children and the peerage became extinct upon his death. Sundon Hall was inherited by 4 nieces, who sold the property.

It is animated by a commitment to certain bedrock principles. Among them: freedom of inquiry, opinion and speech; educational opportunity for all; global citizenship; sustainability; and dialogue.\\" Furthermore UNAI aims to support the realization of the Sustainable Development Goals focusing on the reciprocal relationship between education and sustainable development. History The initiative was formally launched on 18 November 2010 by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at UN Headquarters in New York City. On this occasion, he outlined the purpose of UNAI: \\"By sharing ideas, across borders and disciplines, we can find solutions to the interconnected problems that cause so much suffering. Climate change is not just an environmental threat; it is closely tied to poverty. Poverty is not just about jobs, it is directly related to food security. Food security affects health. Health affects generations of children. Children hold the key to our future. And education can lead to progress on all these fronts.\\" As of July 2017, more than 1,000 institutions in over 120 countries and some 40 academic networks are members of the initiative. The 10 UNAI principles Academic Impact is informed by a commitment to support and advance ten basic principles: #A commitment to the principles inherent in the United Nations Charter as values that education seeks to promote and help fulfill; #A commitment to human rights, among them freedom of inquiry, opinion, and speech; #A commitment to educational opportunity for all people regardless of gender, race, religion or ethnicity; #A commitment to the opportunity for every interested individual to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary for the pursuit of higher education; #A commitment to building capacity in higher education systems across the world; #A commitment to encouraging global citizenship through education; #A commitment to advancing peace and conflict resolution through education; #A commitment to addressing issues of poverty through education; #A commitment to promoting sustainability through education; #A commitment to promoting inter-cultural dialogue and understanding, and the \\"unlearning\\" of intolerance, through education. In action Participating institutions are expected to show their support of one of the 10 UNAI principles by undertaking one activity per year which tangibly supports and furthers the realization of those principles. Examples include lectures, publications, online activities and especially events that promote intercultural dialogue and the international exchange of ideas. UNAI established various communication channels. In order to get in contact and intensify dialogue with academia around the world UNAI uses social media, such as Facebook and Twitter. UNAI provides a collaborative platform where members can learn from each other and enhance each other‚Äôs skills and tools. UNAI provides information on UN activities and provides guidance on how students, professors and researchers can apply their knowledge to the work of the UN and make a difference in their classrooms, communities and campuses. UNAI uses a number of tools to communicate with its members ranging from social media, including Google hangouts, Twitter town halls and Facebook Live interviews, webinars, podcasts, the publication of research, reports and articles on areas of research that can advance the achievement of the SDGs, newsletters and events such as panel discussions, conferences, workshops, film screenings, and briefings.

Early development By the 1920s, radio minstrel shows began appearing on the American radio, usually as musical performers who traveled to different cities doing concerts. As radio stations increased their airtime to fill all day, 7 days per week, demand increased for musicians who could entertain the audience. Radio stations used similar performers at other stations throughout the Midwest and into Tennessee. These migrating minstrels were a mainstay of programming for the rural independent broadcaster. Musicians regularly moved between stations in search of greener concert pastures with better booking potential.Perry, Stephen D.(2001) 'Securing Programming on Live Local Radio: WDZ Reaches Rural Illinois 1929-1939', Journal of Radio & Audio Media, 8: 2, 347 ‚Äî 371 Height The rise of radio minstrel shows occurred on live locally programmed community radio stations. They broadcast content that was popular and relevant to their local/specific audience. During the 1920s and 1930s the majority of stations functioned as independent stations but there was little study on the types of content they aired. It is commonly believed that almost all programming of the era came through the networks with local stations acting as signal repeaters because broadcasts on local stations were produced live and went unrecorded in either sound or paper form.Doerksen, C.J. (1999). 'Serving the masses, not the classes': Station WGN, pioneer of commercial broadcasting of the 1920s. Journal of Radio Studies, 6, 81-100 Thus, it can be difficult to obtain information about programming at the local station levels. Characters The earliest minstrel performers were locally popular. During the beginning of the 1930s, Gene Autry was an American performer who became fame as 'The Singing Cowboy on the radio . In 1929, Autry signed a recording deal with Columbia Records. For four years, he worked in Chicago, Illinois, on the WLS-AM radio show called National Barn Dance,where he met singer-songwriter Smiley Burnette. Lester ‚ÄúSmiley‚Äù Burnett, for example, began performing and announcing on WDZ. By 1933, he had variety shows, including a broadcasting show for children.Smith, J.G. (1994, April 8). Smiley Burnette: A career appreciation. Movie Collector's World, 444, 132 Then the creation of other shows became available. His radio performances gained him notice and he went on to work with Gene Autry in radio first, but then later in film where he ended up as a supporting actor in many of Autry‚Äôs movies. Link of programming: http://www.myoldradio.com/old-radio-episodes/smiley-burnett-show-behold-the- bridegroom-commeth/1 Other artists like The Kentuckians were not paid for their appearance on radio stations in the early years, WDZ had formed an artists' bureau with booking agents to promote live performances by station talent. These performances were for a fee and provided the groups with income. This attracted musicians to the station who stayed as long as their bookings were good.Buchanan, G. (1988, Jan.). Letter to Lynnita Sommer, Correspondence file, WDZ Collection, Douglas County Museum, Tuscola, IL It is their presence on the radio that increased demand for hearing them in concert. In their earliest years, stations like WOAW, Omaha, and KVOO, Tulsa, as well as both KMA and KFNF in Shenandoah, Iowa, utilized amateur performers who would perform for free,Autry, G., & Herskowitz, M. (1978). Back in the saddle again. Garden City, NY: Doubleday but this alone would not promote continuity of programming if there were not some benefit to the performers in the long runPerry, Stephen D.(2001) 'Securing Programming on Live Local Radio: WDZ Reaches Rural Illinois 1929-1939', Journal of Radio & Audio Media, 8: 2, 347 ‚Äî 371 such as money from concert bookings. One station sought to enhance artist appearances by setting up an agreement with a tent owner to set up and move his tent to various locations where station talent would perform. In exchange, the station provided talent and gave free promotion of where the tent was to be each day. This would have provided the acts with at least a somewhat regular place to appear.

As a result of his efforts in Adelaide, East Fremantle used him as a forward when he returned to the club in 1905. He was a member of their 1906 premiership winning team, playing with his younger brother Albert. Another brother, Wilhelm, would also later play at East Fremantle.

The sect itself was extinguished with the reunion in Constantinople of the Arian groups at the behest of Plinta. The dating of this reunion is said to occur after Plinta's consulate (419) and on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the birth of the schism, placing it roughly between 420-423.

He was, however, displaced by Dorotheus of Antioch around 387 or 388. When Dorotheus arrived from Syria, he was immediately installed as the new archbishop, having been considered by his sect to be better qualified for the office than Marinus. It was also cited that the sect has been unhappy with Marinus' deposition, particularly as he represented the views of his party, which became associated with the positions taken by Selenas bishop of the Goths. A key difference, for instance, was the manner by which Dorotheus denied the eternal fatherhood of God while Marinus asserted it. Thenceforth Marinus withdrew from communion with those Arians who followed Dorotheus and, with a group of followers who grew numerous enough to be considered a distinct sect of Arians, maintained a rival network of churches and oratories. The sect held, in contrast to the Arians under Dorotheus, that 'the Father had always been the Father, even when the son was not.'Socrates Scholasticus, Church History, book 5.23.

The Arab League condemned the actions of the Syrian government for the first time. =8 August= Just after midnight, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia gave a televised address condemning the Syrian government over the crackdown. The king also said Saudi Arabia was recalling its ambassador to Syria. He warned Assad to enact major reforms or else Syria \\"will be pulled down into the depths of turmoil and loss\\". Kuwait and later Bahrain also recalled their ambassadors and said a GCC summit would be held soon to determine a unified course of action for responding to the events in Syria. A mother and her two children were killed in Deir ez-Zor by Syrian troops storming the city during the predawn adhƒÅn, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The attack on Deir ez-Zor reportedly continued until noon. Soldiers also entered Maarat an-Numan in northern Syria from the east and quickly cordoned off the city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting, a local opposition committee said in a statement. Seven people attending a funeral in Daraa were also reported killed when security forces attacked the procession, leaving dozens more injured. The deadly incident prompted late-night protests in the city, with demonstrators saying they held police responsible for the violence. The head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed 24 people were killed throughout the country during the day, while UN Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs Oscar Fernandez-Taranco said 87 civilians were killed by Syrian forces. The online group Anonymous defaced the Syrian Ministry of Defense website with a message urging members of the Syrian Army to defect and expressing solidarity with the protesters. President Assad sacked Defense Minister Ali Habib Mahmud and replaced him with General Dawoud Rajiha, the Syrian Army's chief of staff, due to Ali Habib Mahmud's declining health. =9 August= An opposition group reported Syrian forces were attacking Sarmin, a town in Idlib Governorate, at dawn from three sides, conducting raids and arresting residents. Tanks were said to be deployed in and around Idlib, the provincial capital. The siege of Deir ez-Zor continued, with tank shelling reported in the al-Hawiqa district, and at least 15 deaths were reported in the city, along with two more elsewhere in Idlib Governorate. There were also sketchy reports of military operations near Al-Bu-Kamal, close to the Iraqi border. Five were reported killed in Hama, including two children from the same family. Syrian troops also assaulted Binnish in an apparent reprisal for large-scale \\"night rallies after Ramadan prayers\\", according to a local resident, leaving four villagers reported dead. Opposition websites claimed that former Syrian defense minister Ali Habib Mahmud was found dead in his home. A spokesman for the Syrian government initially claimed he had died of \\"a disease\\", while the opposition accused the Syrian government of executing him. According to the opposition, Ali Habib started refusing to send in the army into cities because he feared increasing defections, and for that he was killed. However, he appeared on Syrian state TV hours after his supposed death to deny that he was fired or killed, saying he resigned due to illness. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu met with President Bashar al-Assad for over two hours and spoke with other Syrian officials for four more hours in total before departing Syria without making a statement. Assad reportedly told Davutoƒülu during the meeting that his government \\"will not relent in pursuing the terrorist groups in order to protect the stability of the country and the security of the citizens\\" but said he was still committed to making reforms. Upon returning to Turkey, Davutoƒülu said his government will continue relations with Damascus, but said he had urged Assad to take \\"concrete steps\\" to end the violence without answering whether Assad had agreed to do so. Meanwhile, Egypt sharply criticized the Syrian government for promising reforms while continuing violence, with Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr calling such reforms \\"of no use\\". Amr demanded an end to the crackdown and said Assad and the Syrian populace should engage in a comprehensive national dialogue. In a retaliatory cyberattack for the hacking of the Ministry of Defence website, a website set up by Anonymous was hacked by supporters of the Syrian government, who placed photos of burned bodies and a message claiming the victims were Syrian soldiers and civilians killed by members of the Muslim Brotherhood on the page. =10 August= The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed one dead and 13 wounded by army operations, backed by one dozen armoured vehicles, in the northwestern towns of Sarmin and Taftanaz. Meanwhile, the military appeared to conclude the siege of Hama, withdrawing 40 APCs loaded with cheering soldiers from the city centre, according to a journalist on a government-organised tour. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan lauded the withdrawal and media access, both of which Davutoƒülu had urged the previous day, as \\"a sign that our initiative is producing results\\". However, later in the day the Syrian government decided to put tanks back into Hama, and canceled the withdrawal. The government also announced its withdrawal from Ariha. Seventeen people were killed and 20 more injured by Syrian troops in Homs after the army opened fire on protesters, activists told the Agence France-Presse by telephone. Syrian Ambassador to the United Nations Bashar Jaafari compared the situation in Syria to the ongoing English riots and said that just as in the United Kingdom and other countries, the Syrian government was democratically elected and not a \\"regime\\". The UK's representative sharply rebuked Jaafari's argument, saying, \\"In Syria, you have a situation where thousands of unarmed civilians are being attacked and many of them killed. That comparison made by the Syrian ambassador is ludicrous.\\" In a step The New York Times deemed previously unthinkable, 41 former Ba'ath and current government officials announced an initiative for political transition, and urged an end to the military crackdown on protestors. They were led by Mohammed Salman, a former minister of information with intimate ties to the Assads. =11 August= A resident of Saraqeb, a town near the Turkish border, reported that over 60 vehicles, about 14 of which were reportedly tanks or APCs, entered the town. According to the report, Syrian soldiers began firing randomly and detaining residents en masse. The opposition Local Co-ordination Committees corroborated the report. In Qusayr in Homs Governorate, eleven people were reported killed as the army stormed the town. Two more residents of Hama were killed, according to Avaaz. The town of al-Musayfrah in Daraa governorate was the site of military operations at dawn. The army also shelled at least two neighbourhoods in Deir ez-Zour, Avaaz reported. More mass Friday protests are planned by the Syrian opposition, this time under the title \\"Friday of 'We will not bow except for God'\\". =12 August ‚Äì \\"Friday of 'We Won't Kneel Except to God'\\"= Mass protests continued as twenty-three people were reportedly killed by Syrian forces across the country, including five in Saqba and Douma, suburbs of Damascus, when security forces fired on protesters shortly before Friday prayers. Troops killed protesters in Daraa, Deir ez- Zour, Idlib, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and elsewhere, according to activists. They also allegedly fired on demonstrators in the Midan district of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees reported from Aleppo that shabiha, or plainclothes pro-government militiamen, beat and stabbed dozens of people at a hundreds-strong protest in Syria's largest city. A similar scene played out in Zabadani, residents claimed, where shooting at a local mosque was also reported. Despite a security clampdown on the city of Homs, close to 20,000 people reportedly protested there after prayers. =13 August= The Syrian army entered Latakia with more than 20 tanks and APCs and killed at least two civilians, according to activists. Activists in Deir ez-Zour also said a child was killed by a sniper. The H√ºrriyet Daily News, a Turkish daily, reported that a senior Turkish government official speaking on the condition of anonymity said a military intervention in Syria led by Turkey was an option. The report suggested Ankara is nervous over sectarian tension in Syria inflaming an already unstable situation in neighboring Iraq, which also experienced protests as part of the Arab Spring revolutionary wave. The LCC also reported a death in Qusayr, a death in Daraya, and a death in Hama. =14 August= The LCC said that even as the army's artillery assault continued, the Syrian Navy was firing on Latakia with gunboats off the Mediterranean coast, killing at least 28, according to the Syrian Revolution Coordinators Union. Eight more civilians were killed elsewhere in the country, bringing the day's death toll to a minimum of 36, human rights activists and pro-democracy campaigners said. Syrian state news claimed two police and six armed criminals were killed in Latakia. =15 August= Four to six more civilians were reportedly killed in Latakia as the siege dragged on. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoƒülu demanded that the Syrian government's violent crackdown end \\"immediately and without conditions or excuses ... [or] there would be nothing more to discuss about steps that would be taken\\". In Houleh, an elderly man was shot dead by a sniper as the army began operations in the town, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed. Germany called on the European Union to take stronger action against the Assad administration by strengthening sanctions. A Palestinian refugee camp was among the targets of the shelling, residents, activists, and the UNRWA reported, drawing sharp condemnation from the Palestinian Liberation Organization, among other groups. Twelve people were killed in Homs after post-iftar protests, Al Jazeera reported citing unnamed sources. =16 August= Avaaz said it could confirm nine people in Latakia were killed during the day, Al Jazeera reported. Residents reported looting by shabiha in the al-Ramel neighborhood, where the Palestinian refugee camp is situated, as well as clearing of dead bodies, bullet casings, and other signs of shooting, and said thousands of people were trying to flee but many were being detained or forced to remain in the city. One resident said he feared his neighborhood would be razed to the ground. The Turkish government denied it had plans to create a border buffer zone, but said it was drafting plans for its next course of action if the crackdown continued. Nighttime protests were held in Homs, Albu Kamal, and several suburbs of Damascus, among other places in Syria, in defiance of the security operations. =17 August= The Syrian government claimed it withdrew from Latakia and Deir ez-Zor, but Davutoƒülu disputed this, saying Syrian troops remained in Deir ez-Zor and other centres of protest. He again reiterated Turkey's stance that \\"the bloodshed has to stop\\" and warned that \\"Turkey can naturally not remain indifferent\\" if the crackdown continued. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan compared the situation to the civil war in Libya and vented his frustration with the Syrian government, saying, \\"I've sent my foreign minister, and personally got in touch many times, the last of them three days ago on the phone. In spite of all this, civilians are still getting killed.\\" The post-revolutionary interim government of Tunisia withdrew its ambassador from Damascus for \\"consultations\\". The United Nations reported that in a phone conversation with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Assad claimed that all police and military operations against protesters had stopped. Despite Assad's assertion, activists reported between 9 and 16 deaths of protesters in Homs and said most of the shooting took place after evening prayers. Al Arabiya reported that \\"thousands\\" protested in a central square (Saadallah al-Jabiri square) of Aleppo, the city's largest demonstration to date, as well as various neighbourhoods of the city, before security forces attacked the people gathered there. =18 August= The governments of Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all called for Assad to resign for the first time. Switzerland, despite its policy of neutrality, recalled its ambassador and condemned the violence. Avaaz reported afternoon raids of the al-Ramel neighbourhood, as well as shelling, including of at least one mosque, in Latakia despite Assad's claims that security operations had ended the previous day. The LCC reported continuing arrests and army activities in Deir ez-Zor, but did not report shooting. In a report documenting the uprising up until 14 July, the United Nations found that the Syrian government may have committed crimes against humanity and had practiced such tactics as summary execution, torture, use of indiscriminate force against civilians, and arbitrary arrests. New massive protests are planned for Friday, this time under the title Friday of Beginnings of Victory. =19 August ‚Äì \\"Friday of Beginnings of Victory\\"= At least 23 people were allegedly killed across Syria, with 15 killed in Daraa Governorate, two killed in Douma and Harasta, and six killed in Homs. Six of the dead were killed when security forces stormed a village mosque in Inkhil, opposition activists claimed. About 6,000 people in Qadam, a Damascus suburb, reportedly chanted for President Assad to be tried at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Security forces attempted to use tear gas to disperse the crowd, but when this failed, they opened fire with live ammunition, wounding at least five, activists and witnesses claimed. Lady Catherine Ashton, the European Union's head of foreign affairs, said the EU was making preparations for an embargo on Syrian oil. The Russian government dissented from the tougher stance adopted by the EU and many Western countries, with leading figures saying Assad \\"needs more time\\" to deliver on promised reforms. =20 August= The death toll from the previous day rose to 34, and the Syrian army renewed a siege on Homs with army tanks, firing at the local population to keep them from rallying. =21 August= In a media interview, Assad claimed he wanted to pursue reforms and pursue \\"terrorists\\". Assad warned against foreign intervention. Two people died in Hama when Shabbiha randomly opened fire on civilians in the street. The Syrian opposition gathered in Syria for talks on creating a rival government. =22 August= As protests continued, the UN said the protester death toll had reached 2,200. The United Nations Human Rights Council voted to launch an investigation into crimes against humanity committed by the Syrian government, despite objections by Russia and the People's Republic of China.fhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-23/un-to-investigate-syrian- human-rights-violations-overriding-russia-china.html A UN team visited Homs to assess the humanitarian situation there and investigate claims of human rights abuses by Syrian authorities. Shortly after its departure, security forces reportedly opened fire on demonstrators in the city, leaving at least four dead, Human Rights Watch said. =23 August= In Istanbul, Turkey, the National Council of Syria was announced to \\"represent the concerns and demands of the Syrian people\\". In Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations Human Rights Council voted to condemn the Syrian government over its response to the uprising. At least 12 were killed in Idlib, Hama, and Homs governorates, the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed. =24 August= Despite the National Council's stated purpose in uniting all Syrian opposition groups, a Syrian Turkmen opposition activist complained that his community was marginalised and said he and other Syrian Turks were not invited to the council's formation, and then were accorded only observer status upon attending. A European Union official said the EU would likely place an embargo on Syrian oil within ten days. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that a woman was tortured to death in western Syria, while Al Jazeera reported that three civilians died amid raids in Homs, one protester was killed by snipers overnight in Nessieb, and five people were killed in an agricultural area outside Hama. The Arab Organization for Human Rights put the death toll for the day at 13, reporting several shootings of protesters in Deir ez-Zor and suburbs of Damascus as well, while the LCC said at least 17 were killed across Syria. The Russian Foreign Ministry, supported by the government of the People's Republic of China, released a statement urging the international community not to interfere with Syria's \\"internal affairs\\". =25 August= Prominent political cartoonist Ali Ferzat was reportedly kidnapped and beaten by pro-government assailants before being released near Damascus International Airport. The identity of his attackers was unclear, with some attributing the beating to Syrian security forces. Some reports said both his hands were broken as a \\"warning\\" to dissuade him from drawing. Residents near Latakia and in Deir ez-Zor said they heard gunfire near their homes, the head of the Arab Organization for Human Rights claimed. The LCC said tanks again shelled Deir ez-Zor throughout the day, and at least 118 tanks were reported to be in Shuhail to the city's immediate southeast. The state-controlled Syrian Arab News Agency reported eight soldiers, including an army officer, were ambushed and killed in two separate attacks by \\"armed terrorist groups\\" in Homs Governorate the previous afternoon. The report said at least seven soldiers were wounded in one of the attacks when \\"terrorists\\" shot at a military bus in Talbisah. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offered a measured criticism of the Syrian government for the first time, calling for a national dialogue in a televised interview and saying, \\"When there is a problem between the people and their leaders, they must sit down together to reach a solution, away from violence.\\" The Syrian opposition prepared to launch new Friday mass protests, this time dubbed under the name '\\"Friday of Patience and Steadfastness'\\". =26 August ‚Äì \\"Friday of Patience and Steadfastness\\"= On the last Friday of Ramadan, thousands protested in several Syrian cities, including Damascus, Deir ez-Zor, Deraa, Douma, Hama, Homs, and towns in Idlib Governorate, and security forces responded to many anti-government rallies with live fire and tear gas. 8 protesters were killed overnight when security forces attacked street demonstrations, activists said. The LCC said six people were injured in Qusayr after security forces shot at peaceful demonstrators. At least 3 protesters were reported slain in Deir ez- Zor during the day. Another protester was killed in Nawa, witnesses claimed, and another in Mleeha, one in Qaboun, one in Bosra, and one in Ma\`arrat an- Nu\`man. Many protesters carried placards congratulating the Libyan people on their progress in overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi. Tanks backed up security troops in many places, said residents of protest hotspots. =27 August= Before dawn, protests erupted in Damascus, both in the suburbs and in the city centre. Multiple witnesses reported that a mosque was stormed in Kafarsouseh, a Damascus suburb, and thousands protested there against the government, though a crowd of government supporters turned out to chant slogans in support of Assad. Several protesters, as well as the mosque's 80-year-old imam, were reportedly injured. Security forces used live fire and tear gas against demonstrators in a square adjacent to the mosque, wounding at least five. Hundreds more protested in Moadamiya, another suburb, and in the Damascene neighbourhood of Tijana. A planned protest in Abaseen Square was largely thwarted, though about 60 protesters managed to march into the square before being dispersed. More protesters from Douma marched toward central Damascus, though protesters in the suburb of Saqba met live fire from security forces, leaving at least one dead, activists claimed. In Tehran's most direct warning to Syrian authorities yet, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi said protesters had \\"legitimate demands\\" and added, \\"The government should answer to the demands of its people, be it Syria, Yemen, or other countries.\\" The Arab League also called on the Syrian government to end its crackdown. Two protesters were killed in Latakia and Qusayr, activists said. =28 August= Security barrier in Damascus London-based daily As-Sharq al-Awsat reported that Mohammad Rahhal, the leader of the LCC's Revolutionary Council, said the council had concluded that \\"what we are being subjected to today is a global conspiracy that can only be faced by an armed uprising\\". He said the council was now working to distribute weapons to protesters in order to combat the government's security crackdown. He criticised the international response to the Syrian uprising, saying, \\"Confronting this monster [the Syrian government] now requires arms, especially after it has become clear to everyone that the world only supports the Syrian uprising through speeches.\\" He predicted the protest movement \\"will turn violent very soon\\". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported five protesters were killed, including two who succumbed to mortal injuries from the previous day, and at least nine more were wounded. Residents of Qadam claimed a firefight between soldiers and army defectors who joined protesters took place in the Damascus suburb, though it was unclear if anyone was hurt or killed in the shooting. The Movement of Free Officers claimed \\"large defections\\" from Syrian security forces to the side of the protesters in Harasta, another Damascus suburb, and said a colonel in the Syrian Air Force who was involved in the secret police had been shot in the head in Saqba. The statement claimed shabiha and loyalist troops were pursuing the defectors into central Damascus. On the diplomatic front, the Arab League said it would send Secretary-General Naril Elaraby on a mission to Damascus in an \\"urgent\\" effort to end the crisis, while the Syrian government rejected the Arab League's statement. =29 August= One person was reported killed in a dawn raid on Qara, a suburb of the capital, while five were said to have been killed and at least 60 injured in Sarmin, including a child, when security forces opened fire while conducting house-to-house searches. Five were wounded in Hit, Syria, near the Lebanese border, witnesses said. The crackdown in Hit reportedly prompted at least several dozen Syrians to flee into northern Lebanon. An activist in Homs told Bloomberg News that at least 15 people were killed and 400 injured as Syrian forces again laid siege to the city, though this number could not be confirmed. AFP reported, quoting an anonymous diplomat, that the EU had agreed \\"in principle\\" on a ban on importing Syrian oil, likely to be implemented by the end of the week. After Russia's envoy met with Assad, Moscow indicated \\"no change\\" in its stance of calling for reforms in Syria but opposing sanctions or other forms of international action. In Rastan, there were reports of dozens of conscripted soldiers of the Syrian army defecting to the opposition, where heavy gunfire and power outages were being reported, and a large armoured force surrounded the city. =30 August= On the first day of Eid ul-Fitr, thousands demonstrated against the government in Deraa, Homs, and the suburbs of Damascus. Security forces opened fire on protesters, killing at least nine, the LCC said. Six were killed in Daraa Governorate, an activist said, including a 13-year-old boy. The LCC also reported raids in Rastan, Latakia, Al-Sanamayn, Qara, Qudsaya, Jableh, and Qamashli. Eid celebrations were reportedly muted, with many Syrians visiting graves of loved ones killed during the uprising.

It is a brick and stone structure erected in the early 1890s. It was the last major construction project in the city before the silver-mining industry, mainstay of Aspen's economy, collapsed following the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. The classically inspired decorative touches, such as a colonnade-supported roof over the sidewalk and an elaborate cornice, are the only ones on a commercial building in the city. They anticipate the wider embrace of the Classical Revival style in other cities that began a few years later. For much of its existence it housed a lumber supply store. Local developer Harley Baldwin, owner of the neighboring Brand Building, bought it in 1988. After renovations, he began leasing space within the buildings to upscale retailers, earning the two the combined nickname of \\"Gucci Gulch\\". The Caribou Club, a members-only restaurant and Aspen institution, is located in the basement. Building The building is located on the southeast corner of the intersection of East Hopkins Avenue and South Mill Street. Other commercial structures, historic and modern, fill the built- out blocks. To the immediate east is the Brand Building, with Aspen City Hall on the opposite far corner. Both are listed on the Register. At the south end of the opposite block of Mill is another listed building, the Wheeler Opera House, opposite a pedestrian mall. Like most of its neighbors (except the Wheeler), the Collins Block is two stories high. The north frontage, along East Hopkins, is five bays long with the western facade seven. Rusticated sandstone, interrupted by several storefronts and a recessed corner entrance with column, faces the first floor on both sides. A flat wooden roof extends out to cover the sidewalk on both sides, supported by smooth round wooden Tuscan columns. The second story is faced in brick. On the north face fenestration is one-over-one double-hung sash windows. Its middle three bays have a recessed porch with Ionic columns and a wooden balustrade. At the roofline is a lightly dentilled cornice with broad overhanging eaves. The roof itself is flat. Inside, the ground level consists of storefronts and offices. The upstairs level is a residence. In the basement is the Caribou Club. =Caribou Club= Entrance to the Caribou Club is via an unmarked mahogany door with brass trim. It opens into a paneled entry area with 19th-century Western landscape paintings. On the east is the entrance to the Great Room, similarly paneled in wood and British racing green. It is decorated with more landscapes, by Frederic Remington and Albert Bierstadt, among others. Its dominant piece of furniture is a 10-foot (3 m) sofa with an equally long ottoman. The main corridor leads around the Great Room past bathrooms, the wine cellar and two private rooms to the bar, also accessible from the Great Room. The room has many personal pictures from members on its wall. The bar itself is mahogany with a brass rail along the floor. In the southeast corner is the dining room. It is finished in a shade described as \\"somewhere between Etruscan red and a ripe tomato.\\" Light is furnished by candles and antler chandeliers. There are six round tables for diners. History Samuel Collins began construction of the building in 1891, when the city was at the peak of its population and prosperity due to the Colorado Silver Boom. It was designed to have businesses on the first floor and offices on the second. Collins had problems with the carpenters' union that delayed completion of the project for two years. That delay may have accounted for the disparity between the more Victorian look of the stone lower story and the neoclassical elements of the upper story. The latter may have been inspired by the influential use of neoclassical design at the Chicago World's Fair of 1893. Later that year, Congress repealed the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which had required the federal government regularly purchase the metal to back the dollar in addition to gold. Aspen, which had grown so rich so rapidly from those sales of its silver, suffered severely as the market collapsed and many of its miners left for the gold fields of Cripple Creek. The Collins survived into the city's ensuing \\"quiet years\\" of steady population decline, when vacancy and disuse felled many of the other relics of that era. In the 1930s, a time when Aspen was down to less than a thousand people, the Collins housed a mortuary. A couple named Tom and Alice Rachel Sardy bought it in 1938 and moved in. They also became proprietors of another business in the building, Aspen Supply, which sold furniture and hardware. The mortuary was successful enough that the Sardy family was able to move out and build a house on Main Street across from Paepcke Park which is still known as the Sardy House. They bought a lumber business across the street, moved the mortuary to their house and combined the two businesses into Aspen Lumber & Supply, using almost the whole Collins Block. After World War II, Aspen began to develop into the ski resort town it is today. The Sardys sold part of both their family businesses to Walter Paepcke, the Chicago businessman who guided much of that era of the city's development. In the late 1940s, Tom Sardy recognized that Aspen would need a modern airport, and after being elected a Pitkin County commissioner worked to get one built. Sardy Field at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport is named in his honor. In 1988 the Collins was acquired by Aspen developer and businessman Harley Baldwin, who already owned the neighboring Brand Building. Returning to Aspen after 16 years of activity in New York, he undertook extensive renovations to the structure. The upper floor he returned to residential use, building for himself and his partner, Richard Edwards, a penthouse that was later featured in Architectural Digest. On the ground level he eased out the remnants of the hardware store and other, similar retail tenants. In their place came upscale fashion boutiques such as Bulgari and Brioni, complementing the Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Dior presence at the other end of the block. These entrants into the local marketplace, into a city that had not previously shown the effect of its growing population of rich and famous residents, earned the two buildings the nickname \\"Glitter Gulch\\", which eventually became applied to Aspen as a whole. In the basement of the Collins, Baldwin built the Caribou Club. Admission was limited to members only, the first time such an establishment had opened in Aspen, where celebrities and locals had previously mixed at the Hotel Jerome's bar. Baldwin was criticized for this, but the Caribou became one of the city's most popular nightspots. Diana Ross and Tom Ford, as well as businesspeople like Warren Lichtenstein and Lynda Resnick, are among the regulars. In 1987, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places along with many other historic properties in the city.

Raiko made a name for himself in the early 2000s by being associated with Cape Town‚Äôs, then biggest regular Hip Hop night ‚Äúthe Lounge‚Äù. After the demise of the lounge, Raiko stepped out on his own and established himself as a solo dj outfit, rocking parties in and around Cape Town for the last 10 yrs.http://www.theflyovershow.co.za/tag/kool-out- entertainment/ Having come up through the golden era age of hip hop, his sets tend to lean towards music from that era as well as newer music that emulates that distinct sound. His approach is soulful and jazzy with a hint of raw edge that made Hip Hop so appealing in its prime. Known for smooth, technical sets, his sound has been fortunate enough to allow him to travel throughout South Africa as well as 4 successful European tours as Dj for fellow Pioneer Unit label mate, Rapper Ben Sharpa. Reason joined Kool Out in 2011 to host the new events in Johannesburg. Coming up as a young battle rapper, Reason first made an impact on the scene delivering jingles on the YFM breakfast show. His early success garnered multiple accolades and provided an opportunity for a Scandinavian tour. In 2011, Reason signed to Motif Records and released his 2nd album \\"Audio 3D\\" to critical acclaim. His first single \\"Do It Like I Can\\" topped both the YFM and 5FM charts at #1 in August 2012. P-Kuttah also joined Kool Out in 2011 having already established himself as one of South Africa‚Äôs top hip hop DJs while in Durban. In 2010 he was a Hype Magazine finalist for ‚ÄúDJ of the Year‚Äù and is a noted turntablist. Musically, he also works with his band T.O.T.S and DJs for L Tido and is a brand ambassador for DC Shoes.

In 1775, as the British troops marched into Concord, the Concord Minutemen took position atop Punkatasset Hill. On the hill they were met with reinforcements from the surrounding towns and the number of soldiers grew to at least 400. From their vantage point they saw the smoke of burning militia supply by the British from the center of Concord. Fearing it was their homes being burned, Colonel Barrett led his militia down to a hill only a few hundred yards from the Old North Bridge, and then to the Old North Bridge itself. In the late 19th century, on clear days Concordians and visitors were treated to vistas of Boston, Mount Wachusett, and Mount Monadnock. During the early 20th century, Punkatasset Hill was home to Concord's only ski slope. There was never a ski lift, but ski jumping contests were held there during the 1930s. Today the slope remains cleared, but not in use. In 1971 the land was sold from private property to the town and converted to conservation land.http://concordma.gov/DocumentCenter/View/2093 Today Punkatasset Hill and the adjacent Estabrook Woods are popular hiking and walking destinations.

Central to the achievement of ICME goals has been the creation of a cyberinfrastructure, a Web-based, collaborative platform which provides the ability to accumulate, organize and disseminate knowledge pertaining to materials science and engineering to facilitate this information being broadly utilized, enhanced, and expanded. The ICME cyberinfrastructure provides storage, access, and computational capabilities for an extensive network of manufacturing, design, and life-cycle simulation software.John Allison, Dan Backman and Leo Christodoulou, Integrated computational materials engineering: A new paradigm for the global materials profession, JOM Journal of the Minerals, Metals and Materials Society, Volume 58, Number 11, 25-27 (2006) Within this software framework, data is archived, searchable and interactive, offering engineers and scientists a vast database of materials-related information for use in research, multiscale modeling, simulation implementation, and an array of other activities in support of more efficient, less costly product development. Furthermore, the ICME cyberinfrastructure is expected to provide the capability to access and link application codes, including the development of protocols necessary to integrate hierarchical modeling approaches. With an emphasis on computational efficiency, experimental validation of models, and protecting intellectual property, the cyberinfrastructure assimilates 1) process-microstructure-property relations, 2) development of constitutive materials models that accurately predict multiscale material behaviors admitting microstructure/inclusions and history effects, 3) access to shared databases of analytical and experimental data, and 4) material models. As such, it is also crucial to identifying gaps in materials knowledge, which, in turn, guides the development of new materials theories, models, and simulation tools. Such a community-based knowledge foundation ultimately enables materials informatics systems that fuse high fidelity experimental databases with models of physical processes. In addition, the vision of the ICME cyberinfrastructure is compatible with the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery, which advocates development and deployment of human- centered information technology (IT) systems that address the needs of science and engineering communities and open new opportunities for enhancing education and workforce development programs. According to the NSF directive, IT systems, such as the ICME cyberinfrastructure, should provide access to tools, services, and other networked resources, including high-performance computing facilities, data repositories, and libraries of computational tools, enabling and reliably supporting secure and efficient nationwide or global virtual organizations spanning across administrative boundaries.National Science Foundation: Cyberinfrastructure Vision for 21st Century Discovery, NSF 07-28 (2007)  Implementation  The National Materials Advisory Board (NMAB) of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) committee proposed the following definition for the term ICME cyberinfrastructure: \\"The Internet-based collaborative materials science and engineering research and development environments that support advanced data acquisition, data and model storage, data and model management, data and model mining, data and model visualization, and other computing and information processing services required to develop an integrated computational materials engineering capability.\\"ICME National Academy Report: Integrated Computational Materials Engineering: A Transformational Discipline for Improved Competitiveness and National Security, The National Academy Press (2008) According to NMAB's vision, the building blocks of the ICME cyberinfrastructure are the individual web sites (Web Portals) which offer access to information, data, and tools, each established for specific purposes by different organizations. Linked together, these \\"constituent\\" Web Portals will form the ICME cyberinfrastructure, or ICME \\"Supply-Chain,\\" i.e., a series of well- established, capable and viable organizations.David Furrer, The Development of the ICME Supply-Chain: Route to ICME Implementation and Sustainment at ICME: Overcoming Barriers and Streamlining the Transition of Advanced Technologies to Engineering Practice -- The 12th MPMD Global Innovations Symposium: Plenary Session and the Integration of ICME at the 2011 Annual Meeting & Exhibition (TMS 2011 home page) These organizations are to provide necessary portions of the ICME cyberinfrastructure's value chain: * Fundamental model development * Model integration into software packages * Maintenance of software tools * Database generation * Application engineering * Customer approval and certification For example, Mississippi State University has created an ICME cyberinfrastructure where different models, codes, and experimental structure- property data are available and discussed.

He was an executive at Deere & Company before starting his own companies, which grew to become Velie Motor Company. He developed advanced engines for automobiles and airplanes. Biography =Early life and education= W. L. Velie was born in Moline, Illinois. He was the third of five children born to Stephen H. Velie and Emma Deere, the daughter of John Deere. Stephen Velie had moved to Rock Island, Illinois to work for the C. C. Webber & Company. In 1863 he entered into a partnership with his father-in- law, and when the company was incorporated he was elected to the offices of secretary and treasurer. W. L. Velie had two older brothers, a younger brother who died as an infant and a sister. He graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts in 1885 and Yale University in 1888. After graduation he set out for Montana. =Deere & Company= In 1890 Velie returned to Moline and began working at Deere & Company as a clerk. After a year he became a sales manager. When his father died in 1895 W.L. replaced him as the corporate secretary and a member of the board. In 1902 Velie founded his first company, the Velie Carriage Company of Moline. It manufactured buggies, carriages, surreys, driving wagons, and spring wagons called the \\"Wrought Iron Line\\" of vehicles. In 1907 alone the company made 21,000 buggies and surreys. When his cousin William Butterworth became president of Deere & Company in 1908, Velie was elected vice-president. Three years later he became the first chairman of the executive committee when it was formed. At the same time he founded the Velie Engineering Company, which produced gas, steam and electric motors and engines, plus automobile accessories and motor trucks. In 1916 he merged his two companies and began making tractors. Their first was the Velie Biltwel 12-24, a four-cylinder tractor powered by a Velie-built engine. While this appeared to be a conflict of interest Velie was a strong supporter of Deere & Company‚Äôs acquisition or development of a tractor. For the most part, Velie‚Äôs product lines and Deere‚Äôs lines remained separate. He and Butterworth were in disagreement, however, about the company‚Äôs operation and so Velie resigned his executive committee positions in 1918 and severed all ties with the company in 1921. =Velie Motor Corporation= 1927 Velie Model 50 Standard Sedan While still at Deere & Company, W.L Velie incorporated the Velie Motor Vehicle Company in 1908. While he kept his tractor lines separate from the Deere line, his automobiles were marketed through Deere‚Äôs branch houses. When he merged his companies in 1916 he formed the Velie Motor Company. The products produced by the company came to be known for their quality at a reasonable price. By 1912 the company‚Äôs stock was valued at $1.5 million and four years later it was worth $2 million. Between 1913 and 1915 the Velie factory was turning out an average of 30 cars a day. By 1920 the buggy business was phased out and automobile production peaked at 9,000. Estimates of how many motor vehicles Velie produced in the two decades the factory was in operation range between 75,000 to 300,000. Velie was not the only person in the Tri-Cities, now known as the Quad Cities, who was building automobiles. At one point in the early 20th century there were ten different makes being produced in the area. Velie was the most successful. The U.S. Navy chose the Velie engine along with seven others as the best automobile motors for adaptation to military use. Other winners included the Brewster, Duesenberg, Fiat, Hispania Suiza, Issota Franchina, Marmon and Packard. Between 1916 and 1920 the company also produced the Biltwel 12-25\\" tractor, which was powered by a Velie engine. A Velie Monocoup airplane on display at Quad City International Airport in Moline Willard Velie, Jr. was named the company‚Äôs vice-president in 1927. He was the one who introduced the production of airplanes into the family business. They developed the first six-cylinder valve-in-head airplane motor in 1919. They also developed a five-cylinder radial aircraft that powered their Velie Monocoupe. In 1926 Don Luscombe of Davenport, Iowa and Frank Wallace of Bettendorf, Iowa formed the Central States Aero Company and began building monocoupe airplanes. The Velie‚Äôs started working with the company and then bought it in 1928.Anderson, 143. The result was Mono Aircraft, Inc., a subsidiary of Velie Motor Corporation. The United States Department of Commerce awarded the Velie Monocoupe its highest rating, and plans were developed to build a four seat monocoach. The plane would never be built. W.L. Velie, Sr. died in October 1928. A month later Willard Jr. stopped the production of automobiles and sold the company's interests to an Indianapolis firm. Four months later Willard, Jr. died and the airplane interests were sold to a St. Louis, Missouri firm. The Velie Motor Corporation came to an end. =Private life= Villa Velie in 2017 W. L. Velie married Annie Flowerree in Helena, Montana on May 21, 1890. She was the daughter of Daniel Augustus Greene Flowerree, who was a millionaire cattle rancher. She was also a sister to his college roommate William Flowerree. The Velies raised two children Willard Jr. and Marjorie. Velie built a palatial home, named Villa Velie, for his family on a site on the south side of Moline, overlooking the Rock River Valley. He and his wife were inspired by the many Italian Villas they saw while traveling through Europe. The house was built from 1912-1913 in the Italian Villa style by artisans from Italy and Greece. It contained 46 rooms, of which 14 were bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. The floors on the ground floor and the first floor were covered in marble. Built-in bookcases lined the library walls, which were also frescoed. The slopes toward the river were planted with 21 grape varieties from southern France, and the family produced their own private label wine. The grounds also featured a conservatory that housed banana trees, a putting green, sculptured gardens and a ski run that extended to the river. The family moved to a more modest dwelling during the Great Depression. For a time the house sat empty. In 1941 the home was bought by Stanley Wiedner and it became the Plantation Restaurant.

The work was first performed in K√∂then on 10 December 1718.  History  Bach composed the secular cantata, or serenata, in 1718 in K√∂then to celebrate the twenty-fourth birthday of his employer Leopold, Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then on 10 December. The cantata text was by Christian Friedrich Hunold, who was based at Halle. Bach and Hunold collaborated on other cantatas, including one for the same birthday, . Hunold's text was included in a collection, (Selected and partly never printed poems), which he published the following year, and has thus survived. 1719. Bach's music has been lost apart from a fragment, but there is scope for its reconstruction as he recycled some of it in at least one sacred work. Bach adapted several movements for his 1724 cantata for Easter Monday, . While the structure of the sacred cantata is different (it is closed with a chorale, and it opens with music from the closing movement of the secular cantata), Bach preserved the original dialogue form in which two allegorical figures appear. For (Fortune of Anhalt) and (Fame), he substituted the alto \\"Fear\\" in place of Fortune and the tenor \\"Hope\\" in place of Fame. John Eliot Gardiner has suggested that instrumental music from the lost cantata survives in another cantata from the composer's Leipzig years. The music in question, a sinfonia for strings and woodwind, is the first movement of , which was first performed in 1725.

In 2007 the story was picked up by Boom! and an extended issue zero was released, this time with art by Wilfredo Torres. The story went on for four more issues. It was collected in 2009. Plot synopsis The story centers around Elias Hooke, a former inquisitor for the Puritan Church in colonial Salem. He retired from clerical service after discovering that his participation in the Salem Witch Trials had resulted in the executions of only innocent people, while true evil lurked not in people, but as manifestations of nature. He encounters the Queen of Thorns, a demon witch that takes the form of a gnarled, splintering dead tree. After the Queen kills his family, he leaves the Church in disillusionment, and begins a crusade to fight the true \\"witchcraft\\" in Salem, the Queen and other true \\"witches\\" of her ilk. His weapon of choice is a sickle, which he holds in his hand such that it appears much like a prosthetic hook. After saving an accused (and self-admitted) witch, Hannah, she, he and young priest struggling with his faith find themselves running from both the Church, who wants Hooke killed for his apostasy and Hannah for her witchcraft, and the Queen, for whom Hooke is her largest threat.

Eldest hand has the first right to accept or make trumps. The Unters of Acorns and Leaves (the equivalent of the two black Jacks) are permanent highest trumps, the Wenzels. Kontraspiel is similar to the Scandinavian game Polskpas and is recorded as early as 1811. Card ranking Tens are low. The two Wenzels are the highest members of the trump suit, with the U ranking higher than the U. A Wenzel is not part of its natural suit unless this happens to be the trump suit. If the trump suit is either Hearts or Bells there are 8 trumps. Otherwise there are only seven trumps. Basic concept Every player receives 5 cards in batches of 2‚Äì3 or 3‚Äì2. The remaining 4 cards are not used in the game, except for the first of them, which is turned face-up to determine the preferred trump suit. The actual trump suit is decided in a negotiation phase described in the next section. The standard rules of trick-play as in Whist apply. Eldest hand leads to the first trick. Suit must be followed. The player who played the highest trump, or the highest card of the suit led, wins the trick and leads to the next. To win the game one must win 3 tricks. To make sure that there is always a winner, it is also enough to be the first player to win 2 tricks, so long as the other tricks do not all fall to the same player. A player who does not win a single trick is said to be revolted. A player who wins all 5 tricks is said to make the match. Soloist, contra and recontra Starting with eldest hand, each player gets the chance to become soloist with the preferred suit as trumps. If everybody passes, there is a second round in which each player gets the chance to become soloist with a different suit. In the second round, eldest hand is the only player who is allowed to do this with the preferred suit. If the second round fails as well, the game is not played and the next dealer deals. In the event that the turn-up card is a Wenzel, the dealer automatically becomes soloist with the card's natural suit as trumps. In this case the dealer takes up the card and discards another card face-down to get his or her hand down to 5 cards. If the turn-up card is an Ace and the dealer has not yet looked at his or her hand, then he or she can choose whether to follow the procedure just described for Wenzels. However, if the player has once chosen to take up the game in this situation, automatically does so. This tacit agreement is ended in case it causes the dealer to be revolted. Under certain conditions another player may announce match, replace the original soloist, and determine a new trump suit: * There is already a soloist. * The soloist did not become soloist by taking up a Wenzel or Ace turn-up card before looking at his or her cards. * No card has been played yet. A player who announces match must choose a trump suit other than the preferred suit. At any time before the second trick has been started, any player other than the soloist may announce contra. If all of the following conditions are satisfied, the contrarian is allowed to replace one of his or her hand cards by the turn- up card: * The first trick has not been started yet. * The turn-up card has not been taken up yet. * The soloist has taken the game during the first round. In particular, if the dealer initially passed and then chose to take the game in the second round in the preferred suit, then the turn-up card even is in the trump suit but the contrarian may not take it. This is an incentive for the dealer to pass in the first round. If contra has been announced, then at any time before the third trick has been started, a third player may announce recontra. This can occur in practice when such a third player has been surprised by winning the first two tricks and is sure that no other player will win two tricks. Scoring The game is played for money and uses a pot for the stakes. The dealer pays one unit into the pot before the game starts. The base value of any game is as much as the pot contained before the game, but at least one unit and at most four units. Every soloist, contra player or recontra player receives or pays the base value from or to the pot, depending on whether the player won or lost. In the event that a player wins unexpectedly, without being the soloist, contra player or recontra player, the player receives nothing but the soloist and any contra or recontra player must still pay. Additional side-payments are made in case a soloist matches or a soloist, contra player or recontra player is revolted. * A soloist who makes the match receives one unit from every opponent. * A soloist, contra or recontra player who is revolted pays one unit to every opponent. In either case the amount is doubled if the preferred trump suit was played. In the first case the amount is also doubled if the match was announced. Moreover, a player who announced match but did not make it pays two units to every opponent. Such a player may still have won or lost the game in the normal way. The player is only treated differently from a normal soloist for the purposes of the side-payments. Variations * The Wenzels are treated in the same way as aces when turned up, i.e. the dealer can (consistently) choose whether to take up such games or not. History The game appears in 1853 and may be an elaboration of Polskpas. Having the two black jacks is reminiscent of Euchre. References  Literature  *_ (1880).

Malay folklore refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and taboos that have been passed down through many generations in oral, written and symbolic forms among the indigenous populations of Maritime Southeast Asia (Nusantara). They include among others, themes and subject matter related to the indigenous knowledge of the ethnic Malays and related ethnic groups within the region. The stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of the Malay mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often inter-twined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.  Oral tradition  The oral forms of this lore are transmitted primarily through nursery rhymes, folksongs, theatrical exhibitions, and stories that are commonly told from parent to child. Nomadic storytellers that would roam the temples, marketplaces and palace courts also play a large part in the insemination of the oral traditions throughout the populace, often accompanied by music as well through forms of composed poetry and prose. The oral traditions are often integrated with moral values and some may also include stories of talking animals. =Folk music (lagu rakyat)= Of all the types of oral transmission, those in the form of music appear to be most prevalent in Malay society. Songs and melodies from times of old are sung and resung on a regular basis during festivities such as weddings, celebrations of motherhood and childbirth, rites of passage and at cultural or religious celebrations. They are also utilized in the occasional ceremonial functions in royal weddings, in rites of ascension (or coronation) and royal birthday celebrations; in the form of the more refined court music. Every region or each of the states may employ different versions of oral transmission but the most popular is in the form of folk-singing or lagu rakyat. The Middle Eastern-influenced ghazal can be heard in the southern Malaysian state of Johor especially in the district of Muar. Poets and singers consisting of often females and sometimes males vocalize popular love poems and riddles in the form of pantun to the accompaniment of a composition and of music made for a six-stringed Arabian lute (see oud), Indian tablas, Western violins, accordion and marracas.Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers. Forms of nursery rhymes and lullabies are also sung at weddings and cultural festivals in the state of Melaka by Malays and the Malay-speaking Peranakan communities. The contents of the songs are mostly to do with advice on love, life and marriage and are affectionately known in Malay as dondang sayang meaning \\"song of love\\". Within each of these folk-songs, messages and stories are told, a kind of informal handing down of wisdom from the old to the young in the form of poetry which may include any of these: * Pantun ‚Äì a poem with four stanzas, two of each rhymes with each other * Syair ‚Äì a poem also with four stanzas, with all ends rhyming together * Seloka ‚Äì a poem, similar to pantun * Madah ‚Äì a kind of rhyming speech, a discourse through poetry * Gurindam ‚Äì poetry, set to music =Folksongs= The Malay oral tradition includes a large collection of folksongs. Many of these songs are in the form of stories weaved into poetry or simple rhyme. These folksongs continue to be sung and a sizable number of them are included in the albums of modern-day singers, often with improvisations in terms of melody and more complex musical arrangements to suit a larger accompaniment of musicians as well as singers. A dancer performing the Ulek Mayang. Manifested in a dance and healing ceremony, it narrates a mystical tale about the sea spirits in forbidden love with a fisherman. Among the more well known Malay folksongs include: * Air Pasang Pagi * Anak Ayam * Anak Itek Tok Wi * Bangau Oh Bangau * Bunga Hutan * Burung Kakak Tua * Chan Mali Chan * Damak * Dayung Sampan * Di Tanjong Katong * Geylang Sipaku Geylang * Ikan Kekek * Istana Bunian * Itek Gembo-gembo * Jong Inai * Kenek-kenek Udang * Ketipang Payong * Kopi Susu * Lanchang Kuneng * Lenggang Kangkung * Lompat Si Katak Lompat * Londeh Mak Londeh * Nak Dara Rindu * Nenek Si Bongkok Tiga * Rasa Sayang * Suriram * Sri Mersing * Tanjong Puteri * Tempuk Amai Amai * Trek Tek Tek * Tudong Periok * Tumbok Kalang * Ulek mayang * Wau Bulan A number of these folksongs originally belong to a certain region within Southeast Asia and are sung by the populations within the area. However, due to the nature of inter-mingling and mutual co-migrations within these areas, the folksongs may also be heard in places far from their original geographic origins. =Bardic tales (cerita penglipur lara)= A view of Tasik Chini in Pahang, where a dragon known as Naga Seri Gumum is believed to dwell. Stories of love and romance of princes and princesses, kings and queens, and heroes and their damsels in distress (and often, damsels and their heroes in distress) have long filled the imaginations of ethnic Malays. The fact that numerous royal courts existed and still exist in Southeast Asia supplied the basis of the stories. Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored. These stories are often told by professional story tellers called penglipur lara, which roughly translates to reliever of sorrows. The few penglipur lara that exist today are often farmers or at least rural villagers. In the past, travelling penglipur lara would carry the stories from one kampung (village) to another, making the occasional stops at marketplaces, village squares as well as royal courts. The essence of the stories remain the same but sometimes, adjustments are made according to the individual story-teller's preference. For example, the penglipur lara version of the Ramayana changes many of the names and settings and casts Laksmana as a pawang or Malay shaman, as opposed to the literary Hikayat Seri Rama or the theatrical Hikayat Maharaja Wana which remained closer to the original Indian epic. Among the well known stories that may fall into this category includes the following: * Anak Buloh Betong * Batu Belah Batu Bertangkop * Bayagong * Lebai Malang * Mat Jenin * Naga Tasik Chini * Nenek Kebayan * Nujum Pak Belalang * Pak Kadok * Pak Pandir * Puteri Santubong Puteri Sejinjang * Puteri Walinong Sari * Raja Bersiong * Sang Kelembai * Si Bongkok * Si Luncai * Si Tanggang * Singapura Dilanggar Todak Many of these stories are also condensed and made into poetic songs. A fixed melody is set for each story to the extent that if a melody is played or sung in the absence of its wordings, a Malay would be able to instantly recall the title of the story or at least the name of the characters in the story. =Animal fables (cerita binatang)= Animal fables are often used to explain certain natural phenomena. Other times, they are simple moral tales. In almost all instances, the animals in these stories possess the ability to speak, reason and think like humans, similar to Aesop's Fables. The kancil or mouse-deer serves as the main character in a number of the stories. The Malays regard this humble animal in the highest esteem due to its ability to overcome obstacles and defeat adversaries despite of its rather small and benign appearance. The mouse-deer appears in the state herald of Melaka and even plays a part in the legend of Malacca's founding. Below are listed some of the common fables as well as their approximate title translations. (Note that the word sang, an Old Malay honorific meaning \\"revered\\", appears in all instances preceding the name kancil to indicate respect) * Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Buaya ‚Äì The tale of the mouse-deer and the crocodile * Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Monyet ‚Äì The tale of the mouse-deer and the monkey * Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Harimau ‚Äì The tale of the mouse-deer and the tiger * Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Sang Sempoh ‚Äì The tale of the mouse-deer and the bison * Kisah Anjing dengan Bayang-bayang ‚Äì The dog and the shadow * Kisah Burung Gagak dan Merak ‚Äì The crow and the peacock * Kisah Burung Gagak yang Haus ‚Äì The thirsty crow * Kisah Labah-labah Emas ‚Äì The golden spider * Kisah Labah-labah dengan Burung Merpati ‚Äì The spider and the pigeon * Kisah Kerengga dengan Pemburu ‚Äì The fire-ant and the hunter * Kisah Burung Murai ‚Äì The mockingbird * Kisah Burung Kakak Tua ‚Äì The cockatoo =Ghost stories (cerita hantu)= Malays, as with other Southeast Asians, have always taken great interest in stories of ghosts and spirits. It must be stressed that due to the animistic root of Malay folklore, these ghosts are seen as sharing the plane of existence with humans and are not always considered evil. However, when the delicate line that separates the boundaries of existence is crossed, or a transgression of living spaces occurs, a conflict ensues that may result in disturbances such as possessions. The Malay word for ghost is hantu. However, this word also covers all sorts of demons, goblins and undead creatures and are thought to have real physical bodies, instead of just apparitions or spectres. The most famous of these is the pontianak or matianak, the ghost of a female stillborn child which lures men in the form of a beautiful woman. Below are listed other popular supernatural beings and ghosts as well as their descriptions. * Bajang: the spirit of a stillborn child in the form of a civet cat (musang). * Bota: a type of evil spirit, usually a giant * Hantu galah: a ghost with legs and arms as long and slender as bamboo poles. * Hantu kopek: a female ghost with large bosoms who lures men who cheat on their wives * Hantu kum-kum: the ghost of an old woman who sucks the blood of virgin girls to regain her youth. * Hantu lilin: a wandering spirit that carries a torch or a lit candle at night * Hantu Pemburu: the Spectral Huntsman whose head is always looking upwards with a shoot growing from his neck * Hantu punjut: a ghost that takes children who wander into the forest late at night * Hantu tinggi: lit. \\"tall ghost\\", a type of giant that will flee at the sight of a naked body * Jembalang: a demon or evil spirit that usually brings disease * Lang suir: the mother of a pontianak. Able to take the form of an owl with long talons, and attacks pregnant women out of jealousy * Mambang: animistic spirits of various natural phenomena * Orang minyak: a cursed man covered in oil, who rapes women at night * Pelesit: a type of grasshopper that precedes the polong's arrival. * Penanggal: a flying head with its disembodied stomach sac dangling below. Sucks the blood of infants. * Penunggu: tutelary spirits of particular places such as caves, forests and mountains. * Pocong: a ghost wrapped in white burial shroud * Polong: a spirit resembling a thumb-sized woman. * Puaka: nature spirit of a place which are typically said to reside in abandoned buildings * Raksaksa: humanoid man-eating demons. Often able to change their appearance at will. * Toyol: the spirit of a stillborn child, appears as a naked baby or toddler  Written forms  Malay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called hikayat, kisah or dongeng. The oldest of them were written in Old Malay using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as Sanskrit, Pallava or Kawi. From around the 14th century onward, they were written in Classical Malay using Jawi script which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers. =Epics (hikayat)= The hikayat or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The Hikayat Hang Tuah and the story of Hang Jebat are among the most well known hikayat which are often told and retold in various forms such children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions. The choice of who were to be portrayed as the protagonists and who were to be portrayed as the antagonists usually lies with the alignment of the storyteller, although most commonly, bards tend to maintain a stance of neutrality and dispassion in their story telling. In the stories of Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat for example, the lawful Hang Tuah may be portrayed as the hero, while sometimes, the non- lawful Hang Jebat may assume that role. A page from the first edition of Hikayat Abdullah in the Jawi script. Published in 1849, it is a personal autobiography of Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir, a Malacca-born munshi of Singapore. Other notable hikayat include: * Hikayat Abdullah * Hikayat Amir Hamzah or Hikayat Hamzah * Hikayat Andaken Penurat * Hikayat Anggun Che‚Äô Tunggal * Hikayat Bayan Budiman * Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati * Hikayat Inderajaya * Hikayat Inderaputera * Hikayat Iskandar * Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain * Hikayat Isma Yatim * Hikayat Malim Deman * Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa * Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah * Hikayat Panca Tanderan * Hikayat Pandawa Lima * Hikayat Patani * Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai * Hikayat Seri Rama or Hikayat Megat Seri Rama =Fairy tales (kisah dongeng)= Kisah dongeng are a loose collection of bedtime stories, fables and myths that involves human or non-human characters, often with superhuman powers along with talking animals, and an unearthly setting. In this category, the story of Puteri Gunung Ledang, Bawang Putih Bawang Merah and Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings. Humanoid beings Characters with human-likeness abound in these stories. They are collectively referred to as orang halus meaning the \\"refined folk\\" or \\"soft folk\\" (often erroneously translated as \\"elves\\"). Most are invisible to the average human. * Orang Bunian: \\"hidden people\\" or \\"whistling people\\"; a race of exceptional beauty and grace. * Orang ketot: humans with short stature, similar to dwarves * Orang kenit: small humans, often possessing magic powers * Gergasi: giants or ogres * Gedembai or Kelembai: an ogre who has the power to turn things to stone. * Duyong: mermaids, having the lower body of a fish and a woman's upper body * Bidadari: beautiful heavenly nymphs Lycanthropic beings * Harimau jadian or harimau akuan: were-tiger, were-leopard or were-panther * Ular tedung jadian: were-cobra * Lembu jadian: were-bull Mythical birds * Geroda: a bird made of fire * Jentayu: a bird made of water * Cenderawasih: also known as the Bird of Paradise, considered to be king of the birds; Guardian of a sacred jewel in Kahyangan, lit. the Abode of the Gods. * Burung Petala: a bird in Kelantan-Pattani mythology Beasts * Naga: a dragon said to inhabit caves and watery areas * Raja udang lit. King of Prawns: a very large prawn or lobster-like creature * Hantu Belangkas: a gigantic king-crab that attacks people at sea. Middle Eastern and Persian additions Later folk stories adopted elements from the Islamic world, of Middle Eastern and Persian origin but having arrived by way of Muslims from India. They differ somewhat from their Arabian counterparts due to the fact that what Malays now refer to as angels or demons were originally animistic spirits and deities. * Jin: Djinn * Syaitan: Satan * Pari-pari or peri: Fairies * Malaikat: Angel (Religion- related) * Bidadari/Bidadara: Woman/Man Angel * Semberani: pegasus  Symbolic lore  Apart from the stories and songs, Malay folklore also includes traditions, rituals and taboos related to the physical as well as the more metaphysical realms of the Malay world view. Such knowledge are usually presented in the forms of symbols and signs inscribed or built into temple walls, palaces, houses and often appear on stone inscriptions as well as grave markers. Natural symbolism are also important such as flowers, trees, animals, the sea as well as celestial objects such as the moon and stars. Malays also have knowledge of a series of constellations that are markedly different from the Indian system upon which it is based. Object symbolism such as wood carvings of animals, ancestral images, mythical beings and masks are also common in Malay society. Symbolic forms of folklore are usually the domains of the spirits and are therefore sometimes employed by the traditional healers and shamans. The Malays have been known to employ supernatural forces for healing as well as in the aiding of child-birth, the curing of poisons and in the warding off of spirits. Due to the Islamization movement of recent decades, these practices are not very well-documented in Malay, but have been recorded in some Western sources.

He died in North Carolina in about 1694. \\"Seth Sothel\\" Preservation Society Halsey MapDennis F. Daniels, \\"Seth Sothel\\", NCpedia  Biography  Sothel purchased a propriety from Edward Hyde, which made him become a Lord Proprietor. The Lord Proprietors decided to send Sothel to Albemarle with the order to become governor of the colony. This was based on the fact that Sothel was not a partisan of any faction of the Culpeper's Rebellion, which was still in development. After leaving England, he was captured by Algerian corsairs. During the time he waited to be released, Albemarle was governed by John Harvey and, upon Harvey's death, by John Jenkins. After Sothel was released, he took the role. During his administration, he caused many crimes. Sothel prohibited trade between the settlers and the Amerindians, but he kept the benefits. He imprisoned people who opposed him (including Thomas Pollock and George Durant) and kept his lands. He confiscated \\"merchant ships and their cargoes\\", stole slaves cattle and farmlands and accepted bribes from criminals in exchange for releasing them without prosecution. However, in 1689, after he established the Salmon Creek plantation, the residents of the colony revolted against him and captured him. They sent Sothel back to England for trial where he was punished by forbidding him from another office in North Carolina. He was expelled from the government of the colony on December 2, 1689, and exiled for a year. Sothel fled to South Carolina, becoming governor in 1690, from which he was suspended on November 8, 1691.

First edition, pp 355-398 Some polymers derived from 3-APs are anticholinesterase agents and show hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. More than 70 structurally different 3-APs have been isolated from marine sponges. However, not all such sponges contain 3-AP compounds. Variation in content of 3-APs has been detected even within a single sponge species collected from different geographical area. Although 3-APs look structurally quite simple, the structure elucidation by NMR spectroscopy is complicated by the fact that most of the methylene groups in the alkyl chains show the same chemical shift. Therefore, the 3-APs are an ideal test case for a combined approach of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.Timm C., Mordhorst T., K√∂ck M.

They were able to isolate the toxic halitoxin, identified as a complex mixture of 3-alkylpyridinium polymeric salts.Laville R., Amade P.,Thomas O.P. (2009) 3-Alkylpyridinium salts from Haplosclerida marine sponges: Isolation, structure elucidations, and biosynthetic considerations Pure Appl. Chem., Vol. 81, No. 6, pp. 1033‚Äì1040 Biological activities Some 3-APs have biological activities such as cytotoxicity, ichthyotoxicity, inhibition of bacterial growth, and enzyme inhibition. These activities largely depend on degree of polymerization. The 3-APs polymers possess antimicrobial activity with increase in polymers and show cytolytic, cytotoxic and antifouling activities. The most widely employed are cytotoxicity assays on different normal or transformed cell lines, or antimicrobial assays. =Cytolytic activity= 3-Alkylpyridinium monomers and compounds are considered to have cytolytic activity but at present there are no such reports found that support this mechanism. It appears that the 3-APs compounds that are polymeric in nature are able to permeabilize the cells. In addition the compounds of alkylpyridines are found to be structurally similar to the cationic surfactants indicating that they might be cytolytically quite active in future. =Cytotoxic activity= Almost all 3-APs compounds contains moderate cytotoxicity mechanism in concentration range of few micrograms per milliliter. Some of the cyclic alkylpyridinium compounds such as Cyclostellerramines and dehydrocyclostellettamines are reported to inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and histone deacetylase enzymes. =Antifouling agents= Poly-APs and other natural 3-alkylpyridine are effective on preventing microbial film formation and the tests also confirm that poly-APs form antifouling activities. Therefore, these natural compounds have a great future to provide environmental friendly ingredient in the new generation of antifouling coatings.Sepcic K.,Turk T.(2006) 3-Alkylpyridinium compounds as potential non-toxic antifouling agents Progress in molecular and subcellular biology; 42:105-24  References  Pyridine alkaloids ","title":"3-Alkylpyridinium"},{"id":"31542233","text":"Koyo DirectNET protocol is used by DirectLOGIC PLCs from Automation Direct and is used in APS vacuum controls since 1999.

Haney, published by And/Or Press in 2009. Primarily set in New York City and Los Angeles, the book is a first-person account of a musician-turned-filmmaker's immersion in the punk- rock scene of the 1980s and his subsequent struggles in Hollywood. Haney has said it required nine years to complete the novel, which was well received by the underground music press and has been called a \\"cult favorite\\" by the New York Journal of Books.  Plot summary  As a restless high school athlete in a small, unnamed town in North Carolina, Jason Maddox, the book's narrator, has a sexual encounter with his popular girlfriend's alcoholic mother. Rumors of the encounter circulate at school, and Jason's girlfriend, distraught when she learns of them, attempts suicide. Jason, himself previously popular, is shunned by his classmates, and after confronting and savagely beating the classmate who started the rumors, Jason is arrested, expelled from school, and all but disowned by his conservative, mortified parents. Taking a job as a house painter, Jason moves into an apartment complex where he befriends one of his new neighbors, Bernard ‚ÄúPeewee‚Äù Mash, an intellectually precocious fifteen-year-old who, like Jason, is a local pariah. Peewee introduces Jason to art, literature, and, most importantly, punk rock. He and Jason are particularly enamored of the Los Angeles punk band Rule of Thumb, which is led by a UC Berkeley-educated poet, Jim Cassady, who is revered by both Jason and Peewee. Learning that Rule of Thumb will be performing at New York City's CBGB, Jason quits his job in order to drive himself and Peewee to New York. After the show, they speak to Jim Cassady, who advises them to start a band. They immediately make plans to move to New York, where they live on the Lower East Side, center of the New York punk scene. There, Peewee becomes increasingly difficult, at odds with Jason musically and jealous of Jason's sexual prowess. Alternately given to tantrums and sullen silences, Peewee is ousted from the band that he co-founded. He and Jason pursue music separately until, recognizing how much they miss each other, they reconcile and start a new band. Banned from most local venues because of its explosive, destructive shows, the band begins touring the U.S., and in the midst of what will prove to be its final tour, Peewee is killed in a car crash, with Jason narrowly surviving. Devastated, Jason decides he's finished with music and, using money from an insurance settlement, he produces and directs a film that takes him to Los Angeles, where he falls in love with an aspiring actress who is herself seeking a new life after fleeing the civil wars in her native Yugoslavia. The actress, Irina, is married to a wealthy Englishman who is happily unaware of her affair with Jason and, possibly, others prior. Their stormy romance is addictive to Jason, who begs Irina to leave her husband for him. She repeatedly and emptily assures him she will. At a party one night, Jason meets another former punk who tells him that Jim Cassady has recently been spotted, homeless and panhandling on the streets of Hollywood. This is the first sighting of Cassady, as far as Jason knows, since Rule of Thumb disbanded in the early 80s. Jason has always been mystified and intrigued by Cassady's disappearance, and he determines to find him, eventually discovering that Cassady is now living in a bleak Los Angeles suburb with his elderly mother. Cassady shares some of his recent songs and poems with Jason, who thinks they're deserving of a wide audience. Except for Cassady's music and the advice he gave Jason and Peewee at CBGB almost twenty years before, Jason might still be miserable in North Carolina, and he means to express his gratitude by helping Cassady gain a new following.

For the next two years he taught natural history at Garfield University in Wichita. When funds ran out to pay him, he returned to Kansas State Agricultural College and acquired his master's degree in botany and plant cultivation. While there, he worked with A.S.

When the Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology became part of the Bureau of Plant Industry in 1901, Carleton was put in charge of the grain investigations section (head cerealist). Due to his belief that improvements in yield would be most likely from the introduction of new varieties, he concentrated on a program of experimental trials of various seed stocks.Hargreaves, Mary W.

Based in Cairo, the service became known to many Arabs and non-alike, as the main medium through which former Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser spread his messages on Arab unity and revolutions across the Arab world. Despite its unmatched popularity in most of the 1950s and 1960s, the service no longer commands a large audience and does not play a significant role in domestic Egyptian or regional politics.  History  = Founding = Although disagreement exists about who initiated the service, most media observers recognize that Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the coup leaders at the time and later President of Egypt, was the main driving force behind the project. According to Douglas Boyd, the idea of the service came from Mohammed Abdel-Kader Hatem, who would become Minister of Information. Until 1967, director and chief announcer Ahmed Said headed and managed the service. Unlike the press, which the new government did not control until 1960, the radio fell under the monopoly of the government, who used this to their advantage. Recognizing the immense potential of radio, Nasser devoted \\"considerable financial resources to the expansion of public broadcasting.\\" Voice of the Arabs first aired on 4 July 1953, one year after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 as a half-hour radio program on Cairo Radio. Quickly, the show developed into its own radio station broadcasting across the Arab world. A year after its initial broadcast, the service's transmission time tripled. By 1962, the service expanded to broadcasting 15 hours a day. This expansion made Egypt the \\"dominant broadcaster in the Middle East and a major international broadcaster\\" during the 1950s and 1960s. The following decade, the service had expanded to 24-hour-a-day broadcasting. = Under Nasser = Under Nasser's presidency and the leadership of Said, the revolutionary fervor of the coup leaders' ideology, the promotion of pan- Arabism, an anti-imperialist tone and the legendary voice of Egyptian singer Umm Kulthum characterized the service. Voice of the Arabs also called for the liberation of Palestine and galvanized Arabs in North Africa, Iraq and Yemen to rise up against colonial and monarchical rule. The station's tagline, which Ahmed Said claims to have written, was \\"Sawt al-Arab, calling to the Arab nation from the heart of Cairo\\" (\\"ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® ŸäŸÜÿßÿØŸâ ÿ£ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ® ŸÖŸÜ ŸÇŸÑÿ® ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßŸáÿ±ÿ©\\"). During what came to be known as the \\"Ahmed Said Era\\" (1953‚Äì1967), programming consisted of news, commentary on political topics, speeches by public officials including Nasser, talks by and interviews with various Arab political figures and dramas with political themes. The service also regularly featured nationalistic songs by popular musicians, like Abdel Wahab and Umm Kulthum, praising Nasser and his accomplishments and promoting pan-Arabism. The radio station used music not only as a propaganda tool but also to attract listeners to \\"serious programs schedule adjacent to the musical programs.\\" Frequently, Nasser's speeches would be broadcast after a musical performance by Umm Kulthum. While the audience for the service was broadly the whole Arab- speaking world, changing social and political conditions influenced programming and subjects for discussion. The service designed targeted programs for the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.  Pan-Arabism  Voice of the Arabs functioned as Nasser's main vehicle in propagating his pan-Arabist views; it played a key role in propelling him to the leadership of the Arab Nationalist Movement. The service filled with declarations on Arab unity and statements that highlighted Egypt's and Nasser's roles as leaders of this movement. In 1954, it declared on air that \\"the Voice of the Arabs speaks for the Arabs, struggles for them and expresses their unity\\".  Anti-imperialism/anti-colonialism  The programming was also characterized by an anti-colonial tone and a rejection of Western imperialism. On one occasion, the service announced that Voice of the Arabs was \\"in the service of the Arab nation and its struggle against Western imperialism and its lackeys in the Arab world.\\" The first three years of its broadcasts focused on North African political struggles. The service supported the causes of French-exiled Sultan Mohammed V in Morocco and Habib Bourguiba's Neo-Destour Party in Tunisia. As an expression of Nasser's anti-colonial stance, the service enabled and encouraged exiled Algerians to update Algerian followers on their activities. Voice of the Arabs supported Algerian revolutionaries not only by allowing them to use the services and facilities of the station but also by explicitly favoring the FLN's struggle against the French and broadcasting anti-French propaganda. The service then turned its attention eastward; Iraq and Jordan became the next targets of Nasser's anti- colonial rhetoric and broadcasts. In an effort rid the Arab world of any Western influence, Voice of the Arabs launched a propaganda war against Iraq's then-Prime Minister Nuri as-Said, criticizing Iraq's participation in the Baghdad Pact. It also appealed directly to Jordanian citizens, calling them to campaign against Jordan's potential participation in the Baghdad Pact. This continued until the 1958 Iraqi Revolution overthrew the Iraqi monarchy, and Iraq subsequently withdrew its participation from the organization. Voice of the Arabs widely broadcast Nasser's nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956 and the removal of British Forces from Egypt, contributing to the service's popularity and heightened concern among Western powers regarding the service. Combined with attacks on British and French allies in the region, these events led Britain and France to increase monitoring of Egyptian broadcast. Violent and non-violent efforts to silence the radio failed and contributed to the radio's and Nasser's prestige and popularity. From 1956 to the 1960s, Voice of the Arabs also gave expression to anti-British sentiments vis-√†-vis its broadcast in North Yemen. The service provoked action against the British presence in Aden (Southern Yemen), a move countered by Saudi-Arabian-supported pro-British radio broadcasts from Aden. Voice of the Arabs then took a more aggressive stance against Saudi-Arabia. Following the union with Syria in 1958 and the expansion of Egypt's transmitter power, the service also promoted liberation struggles in African countries south of the Sahara. = Decline in popularity = The station's popularity was tied to Nasser's accomplishments and successes as president and symbol of Arab unity. Therefore, the lack of spectacular success for Pan-Arabism and Nasser between 1958 and 1967 heavily contributed to gradual loss of credibility and fame of the station. Transmission of false reports during the Six-Day War consolidated its decline. From the start of the war, the Egyptian military relayed updates from front to the service, yet some reports had been false. Though Israel defeated Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian forces on every front, Said reported great victories. Days after the war's start and Israeli forces had captured the Gaza Strip from the Egyptians, East Jerusalem and the West Bank from the Jordanians, and the Golan Heights from Syrians, the Voice continued to report an Arab victory. Other radio stations also broadcast Said's initial claims that Egypt was winning the war, contributing to the build-up of hope that victory was near. This made the eventual let down bigger and cost the station its credibility. Said was dismissed from his position, though Nasser had made the decisions behind the false broadcasting. The Voice and Said later symbolized Egypt's self-deception, and the Voice has not regained its former reach or impact.

This instrument has a unique feature: there is a graphite channel which guides a series of \\"sympathetic\\" resonating strings through the neck from the bridge up to the headstock. These strings vibrate or resonate against a \\"jiwari\\" bridge, which produces the sustaining drone typically associated with Indian music. The instrument(s) also have at least 6 standard guitar strings which traverse the length of the neck just as they do for a standard steel-string acoustic guitar.

(Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States) military organisation with a mandate to enhance coalition warfighting capability through air force interoperability. AFIC consists of representatives each nation‚Äôs Air Forces and the United States Navy. AFIC has a Washington DC based Management CommitteeThe Management Committee consists of five members, one from each member nation and a small admin staff. The MC members are both an international representative of the AFIC secretariat (thus with no national executive authority) and also act as Chair for at least one Working Group, managing and co-ordinating that WGs actions and progress both during and between meetings. Each MC member is also assigned a secretarial function for another WG. which oversees the execution of the program‚Äôs Vision and Mission with the cooperation of experts from member nations' defence departments. AFIC's primary outputs are Air Standards, Advisory Publications and Information Publications which document common specifications, interoperability procedures and/or tactics, techniques, procedures (TTPs) in order to increase operational effectiveness.  History  In 2017, AFIC updated its name to Five Eyes Air Force Interoperability Council. It was originally called the Air Standardization Coordination Committee (ASCC), when it was formed in 1948 by the air force chiefs of staff of Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to further those nations' capabilities to conduct combined air operations and to provide each other with certain essential services, namely the capability for aircraft to be cross-serviced. The ASCC was expanded to include the United States Navy in 1951, Australia in 1964 and New Zealand in 1965. An external review of the ASCC was undertaken in 2004 to examine the organisational processes and structures. As a result of this review in 2005 the ASCC was restructured, downsized and renamed the ‚ÄòAir and Space Interoperability Council‚Äô (ASIC). In 2016 the Air Chiefs of the Five Eyes nations recommended that in order to increase ASIC‚Äôs operational relevance, ASIC should refresh its principles, refocus its activities, and consider updating its name. As directed, in 2017 ASIC reviewed and amended its operating concepts and procedures, refocused its activities to concentrate on Air Force interoperability outcomes and changed its name to the ‚ÄòFive Eyes Air Force Interoperability Council‚Äô.  Vision  Fully integrated and interoperable coalition air and space forces. The meanings of ‚Äòintegrated‚Äô and ‚Äòinteroperable‚Äô largely overlap, but it is important to capture both shades of meaning. ‚ÄòIntegrated‚Äô describes a state in which AFIC member nations' forces operate as a seamless unit. ‚ÄòInteroperable‚Äô reflects AFIC‚Äôs primary focus; a state in which forces and equipment can operate together to accomplish the mission.  Mission  To identify and resolve current and future air force interoperability challenges by leveraging collective expertise. AFIC is to identify known, emerging or anticipated interoperability vulnerabilities that would serve to deny or disadvantage the Five Eyes Coalition and direct action to mitigate, address or resolve the vulnerability.  Task  Deliver improved Five Eyes air force interoperability.  Working Groups  To enable the timely execution of the AFIC Vision and Mission, standing working groupsWorking Groups comprise a Head of Delegation (HoD) from each nation who represents their national interests within the Working Group and various Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) who tackle the specific issues germane to the task in hand cover seven key warfighting functional areas. #Agile Combat Support - covers the essential capabilities and functions to establish, operate, sustain and close an airbase, and deploy and recover coalition air forces. #Air Mobility - covers the movement of personnel, materiel and forces by air to, from and within a theatre of operations; including airlift, air-to- air refuelling, aerial delivery, and aeromedical evacuation, special operations support. #Airworthiness - covers the Military Airworthiness Authorities (MAAs) from the AFIC Nations working collaboratively ensure military aircraft airworthiness and the promotion of best practice. #Aerospace Medicine - covers all aspects of aviation medicine and involves the Surgeon General (or equivalent) for each member Air Force. #Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance - covers the tasking/direction, collection, processing, exploitation and dissemination of accurate, timely, relevant and assured information to provide the battlespace awareness essential to successful planning and conduct of operations. #Force Protection - covers all measures and means to minimize the vulnerability of personnel, facilities, materiel, operations and activities from enemy threats and hazards. #Fuels - covers Fuels, Oils, Lubricants and Gases, including standardise techniques and procedures in the testing, certification and acceptance of aviation fuels including alternative fuels. #Live, Virtual and Constructive ‚Äì covers aerospace systems training simulation.

The territory managed by secular lords for the bishops was not identical with that of the bishopric, but was located within its boundaries and made up about a quarter of the diocesan area. The territory was referred to at the time as Stift Verden or Hochstift Verden, roughly equating to Prince-Bishopric of Verden. This territory described in local sources today incorrectly as Bistum Verden (\\"Bishopric of Verden\\") and, in 1648, was given the title Principality of Verden, sometimes referred to as the Duchy of Verden.  Location  The territory of Verden covered the eastern part of the present district of Verden (its border ran between Langwedel and Etelsen), the southern part of the district of Rotenburg (W√ºmme) and parts of the districts of Harburg and the Heath district (Heidekreis).  History  = Foundation = The Diocese of Verden was founded around 800 in Verden upon Aller as an episcopal see and initially belonged to the Ecclesiastical Province of Mainz. Originally held in personal union with Amorbach Abbey in the Odenwald, by the 9th century the bishopric had become a political football for the regional nobility. For example, the Amelungs promoted their favourite monks from Corvey Abbey to the episcopal throne. = High Middle Ages = In 985, Emperor Otto III, represented by his mother, Empress Theophanu, granted the bishop of Verden market, minting, taxation and ban privileges in the Sturmigau ‚Äì as the region of the present district of Verden and the pre-1977 district of Rotenburg was then called. These privileges formed the basis of a future prince-bishopric (Hochstift), which materialised with the carve-up of the old Duchy of Saxony in 1180. Prince- Bishop Tammo of Verden gained for about a quarter of the diocesan territory, where the see held already considerable privileges, the territorial princely power, establishing the Prince-Bishopric of Verden. In 1195 Prince-Bishop Rudolph I founded the castle of Rotenburg upon W√ºmme as a stronghold against the neighbouring Bremen prince-archbishops. Later the castle took on the function of a prince-episcopal Residenz. Since the Investiture Controversy in the 11th and 12th century the cathedral chapters used to elect the Catholic bishops in the Holy Roman Empire. Thus Verden prince-bishopric was an elective monarchy of imperial immediacy within the Empire, with the monarch being the respective bishop usually elected by the chapter and confirmed by the Holy See, or exceptionally only appointed by the Holy See, which happened in increasing frequency in Verden. Papally confirmed bishops were then invested by the emperor with the princely regalia, thus the title prince-bishop. In the early 13th century the Pope was increasingly involved by the local prince- bishops in regional affairs. From the 14th century it was hardly possible to hold out against the papal commission, which led to a strengthening of the influence of the cathedral chapter; whilst many prince-bishops were now seen as Landfremde or alien, who lacked local support because they were not elected by the chapter but only appointed by the pope. From the early 16th century the prince-bishopric belonged to the Lower Rhenish‚ÄìWestphalian Circle (colloquially: Westphalian Circle), a fiscal and military subsection of the empire. Verden sent its representatives to the diets of the empire and the Imperial Circle. At times the prince-bishops ruled in personal union the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. In order to maintain the two seats in the diets the sees of Bremen and Verden were never formally united in a real union. The same is true for the collectively governed Duchies of Bremen and Verden which emerged in 1648 from the secularised two prince-bishoprics. Around 890 AD the cathedral chapter was able to effect a separation of their estate from that of the bishop, under the law of property. From 1275, it was fixed at 16 members, of whom the five eldest were responsible for ordination of priests, the five middle ones the appointment of deacons and the five youngest the appointment of sub-deacons. The provost of St. John's in L√ºneburg was the 16th member and, as such, had a special status. Its members supplemented the chapter, whose dignitaries included the provost, dean, scholaster, cellarer, cantor and treasurer, independently. Towards the end of the 15th century, there were no fewer than 48 cathedral vicars (Domvikaren), led by the two episcopal vicars. Several of the eight archdeacons were incorporated into the cathedral chapter. While the Prince-Bishopric of Verden belonged, like the neighbouring County of Hoya, to the Westphalian Circle, other adjacent territories such as the Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg and Prince- Archbishopric of Bremen were part of the Lower Saxon Circle, albeit ecclesiastically having a share in the Verden diocese. Verden's secular territory in those days roughly covered what is now the eastern part of the county of Verden, the southern part of the county of Rotenburg and parts of the county of Heidekreis. = The Reformation = From 1558, a gradual change of confession to Lutheranism took place across the Verden diocesan area at different speeds depending on whether its secular rulers promoted or inhibited the Reformation. Within Verden's secular territory, the actual Hochstift, the Reformation was concluded with the enactment of a church ordinance by Administrator Eberhard von Holle, in 1568. In 1630, during the Thirty Years' War, a Roman Catholic bishop, Francis of Wartenberg, took over again as a consequence of the Edict of Restitution, but was only able to hold office until 1634. Thereafter, the Roman Catholic church was only represented there by the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Missions. = Principality of Verden = In 1648 the bishopric was finally secularised as a result of the Peace of Westphalia. It became a principality and was transferred to the Swedish crown, whereby the existence of the Stift and the bishopric came to an end. It lasted from 1648 to 1712, with a break from 1675 to 1679, ruled together in personal union with the territory of the former Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen as the Duchies of Bremen and Verden (formally the Duchy of Bremen and Principality of Verden) with their capital in Stade. For the further history see: Bremen- Verden. In the Swedish-Brandenburg War from 1675 to 1676, Verden was conquered in a campaign by several states of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark and remained in allied hands until the end of the war in 1679. In 1712, Denmark conquered the state, but sold it in 1715 to the Electorate of Hanover. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Principality of Verden lost its importance as an Imperial Estate (Reichsstand). After its occupation and annexation during the Napoleonic Wars, it went to the Kingdom of Hanover following France's defeat. In 1823, the Principality of Verden was formally dissolved and turned into a Hanoverian administrative unit, Landdrostei Stade, along with the Duchy of Bremen and Land Hadeln, but with a participation in the administration of the estates of Verden, Bremen and Hadeln that still existed. In 1864, the first two were merged into the \\"Region of the Duchies of Bremen and Verden\\" (Landschaft der Herzogt√ºmer Bremen und Verden) by a Hanoverian act and their area of responsibility redefined. The new Landrostei became part of the Province of Hanover which was annexed by Prussia in 1866. On 1 April 1885, Landdrostei Stade was renamed Regierungsbezirk Stade in accordance with normal Prussian administrative practice. In 1946, the State of Hanover became part of the new post-war West German state of Lower Saxony, Regierungsbezirk Stade continuing to exist until 31 January 1978. Today, the territory of the former duchies of Bremen and Verden is only reflected in the Stade Regional Association and the Region of the Duchies of Bremen and Verden which, today, has the responsibility for territorially defined public fire insurance as part of VGH Insurance.

Apulia (from the Greek ·ºàœÄŒøœÖŒªŒØŒ±, in , ) in Hebrew:◊§◊ï◊ú◊ô◊î) is a region in the \\"heel of the boot\\" of the peninsula of Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea. The Jews have had a presence in Apulia for at least 2000 years. The Jews of Apulia had a rich Rabbinic tradition and also had a sizeable Jewish population in the central Mediterranean prior to their expulsion. Ancient history Apulia was once part of the ancient Roman province of Bruttium, then became part of the Italian region of Calabria until its distinction today as a separate area. In the 1st century, Roman records tell of the Jewish communities of Bari, Oria, Otranto, and Taranto. Other legends tell of Jewish captives deported from Judea by the Roman Emperor Titus after the fall of Jerusalem in the year 70. Official documents from the Western Roman emperor Honorius in the year 398, confirm there were several Jewish communities in Apulia. The many tombstone inscriptions, some entirely or partially written in Hebrew, found in Trani, Taranto, Matera, Bari, Brindisi, Otranto, and Oria shows the large number of Jews settled in the region, and the usage of Hebrew. Inscriptions found in the town of Venosa (nowadays in Basilicata but previously in Apulia) mention the communal organization of Jewish life in southern Italy. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the region of Apulia fell under the rule of the Byzantine Empire and during the 9th century. This opened a troubling time of zealous Christian missionary effort for the region's Jews. In 875 and 925, Arab armies invaded and occupied parts of Apulia, resulting in much misery for the Jews, which forced many of them to flee for their lives. The Jewish court physician Shabbethai Donnolo lived Calabria/Apulia area in the tenth century and wrote of these times. Medieval history During the early period of the Middle Ages, Calabria, Basilicata and Apulia forming the Catepanate of Italy were under Byzantine rule. By the 11th century, the region was again a peaceful haven for the Jews. During this time many Apulian Torah scholars had regular contact with the Rabbinic academies of the east. The Chronicle of Ahimaaz in 1054 contains many details on Apulian Jewry. Apulian poets of the time include Shephatiah of Oria who wrote the poem \\"Yisrael Nosha\\" which is included in the Neilah service on the Day of Atonement in the Ashkenazi liturgy.www.blackwellreference.com Amittai in Oria, and Silano in Venosa were also well-known poets. Torah scholars are mentioned from the middle of the tenth century in Bari, Oria, and Otranto. The Josippon chronicle, composed sometime in the mid-tenth century, is a product of the southern Italian Jewish/Hebrew culture. The south Italian Jewry contributed to the early Ashkenazi culture in central Europe. The Jews of France and Germany recognized the scholarship of the Apulian center as late as the 12th century. This is acknowledged in a quote by the French Tosafist, Jacob ben Meir: \\"For out of Bari goes forth the Law and the word of the Lord from Otranto\\" Other rabbinic scholars of Apulia in the 13th century include Isaiah ben Mali of Trani (the Elder), his grandson Isaiah ben Elijah of Trani, and Solomon ben ha-Yatom. The lives of the Jews in Apulia continued to be tolerable until the end of the 13th century. Jews in Apulia owned land, were employed in crafts, such as the dyeing industry. Thomas Aquinas, a native of southern Italy, refers to the employment of the Jews in southern Italy in 1274, saying: \\"it would do better to compel the Jews to work for their living, as is done in parts of Italy, than to allow them‚Ä¶ to grow rich by usury.\\" Toleration of the Jews in Apulia came to end when Apulia, as well as other parts of southern Italy, fell to the Kingdom of Naples. King Charles II of Anjou ordered the forced baptism of all Jews in his realm. Many Apulian Jews fled to neighboring central Italy and northern Italy. Many also moved to the Germanic areas of central Europe. All synagogues at that time were converted into Roman Catholic Churches and all Torah academies were closed. Many of the Jews who had been coerced into Christianity, still practised the Jewish faith in secret. These Jews became the historic population of Neofiti. These Crypto-Jews, also known in Hebrew as Anusim, were frequently compelled to live in special quarters known as Giudecca. They were regarded by the local Catholic population as heretics. In 1311 King Robert directed that those who had either secretly practised or relapsed back into Judaism should be severely punished; the order was renewed in 1343 by Joanna I. Both Jews and Neofiti who had again settled in Apulia in the 15th century were subjected to mob attacks occurring in Bari and Lecce in 1463. The invasion of Otranto by the Ottoman Turks in 1480 led to a large massacre of Jews who lived in the area. In 1492, after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, many Spanish and Portuguese Jews settled in Apulia. This led to a small revival of Jewish life in the area. Isaac Abrabanel lived in Apulia at this time after leaving Spain. However, the revival was short lived. In 1495, the Kingdom of Naples fell to the French and King Charles VIII ordered more restrictions to be placed on the Jews of Apulia. Also in 1495, the Jews Lecce were massacred and the Jewish quarter was burned to the ground.www.jewishencyclopedia.com Lecce was the birthplace of Abraham de Balmes a noted Hebrew expert. One Balmes' pupils was Daniel Bomberg. Among the privileges granted the city council of Martina Franca (Taranto) in 1495, King Frederick of Aragon forbade Crypto-Jews and Neofiti to press charges against those who robbed them (probably during the riots of 1494‚Äì1495 during the French invasion of the Kingdom of Naples) and prohibited their coming to live in that city. Also in 1495, the Jews of Martina Franca were massacred. When Apulia fell to the Spanish in 1510, the beginning of the end was in sight for the Apulian Jews. The Spanish Inquisition reached Apulia because of the large number of Jews, Crypto-Jews and Neofiti living in the area. A series of expulsions started 1511. Most Jews and Neofiti were expelled and or tortured to death. Most Jewish property was seized and all remaining Synogoues were rededicated as Catholic Churches. By 1540, the last expulsion finally ended Jewish life in Apulia. Most remaining Crypto-Jews were driven so deep underground that their presence finally came to an end as well. Some of the Apulian Jewish refugees fled north. However, most of them settled in Greece or the Aegean islands. The Apulian Jews set up new congregations in Corfu, Arta and Salonika. Sadly, the last remnants of the Apulian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust.http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org www.jewishencyclopedia.com Modern times In 2006, the orthodox Scolanova Synagogue was rededicated and opened for worship in Apulian city of Trani. The synagogue was built in the 13th century but seized by the Roman Catholic Church in 1380 and converted into a church. A congregation of Jews of San Nicandro and Apulian Gerim descended from Neofiti families, worship in the synagogue regularly. In addition, the former Scolagrande Synagogue, which is now the St. Anne's Church, Trani, has a Jewish museum. Language and culture It is known that the early Jewish inhabitants in southern Italy including Apulia, spoke mostly Greek and Latin as their vernacular. Later this evolved into the hybrid languages Jewish Koine Greek and Judeo-Latin. After the decline of the Roman Empire, The Jewish Koine became to Judaeo-Greek and Judeo-Latin gave way to different forms of Judeo-Italian known as \\"Italki\\". The Jewish community of Salento (at that time a region inhabited mostly by Greek Christians) was in the Middle Ages Greek-speaking while the rural Jews in the outland of Salento spoke mostly Judaeo-Italian.Safran, L.

It allows users to interactively explore the evolutionary history of genes through the visualization of phylogenetic trees and multiple sequence alignments. Moreover, phylomeDB provides genome-wide orthology and paralogy predictions which are based on the analysis of the phylogenetic trees. The automated pipeline used to reconstruct trees aims at providing a high-quality phylogenetic analysis of different genomes, including Maximum Likelihood tree inference, alignment trimming and evolutionary model testing. PhylomeDB includes also a public download section with the complete set of trees, alignments and orthology predictions, as well as a web API that facilitates cross linking trees from external sources. Finally, phylomeDB provides an advanced tree visualization interface based on the ETE toolkit, which integrates tree topologies, taxonomic information, domain mapping and alignment visualization in a single and interactive tree image. New steps on phylomeDB The tree searching engine of PhylomeDB was updated to provide a gene-centric view of all phylomeDB resources. Thus, after a protein or gene search, all the available trees in phylomeDB are listed and organized by phylome and tree type. Users can switch among all available seed and collateral trees without missing the focus on the searched protein or gene. In phylomeDB v4 all the information available for each tree is now shown using an integrated layout in which tree topology, taxonomy data, alignments and domain annotations, and event-age (phylostratigraphy) information are rendered in the same figure using the newest visualization features provided by the ETE toolkit v2.2: # Pfam domains have been mapped to each alignment in our database and are now displayed in a compact panel at the right side of the tree. For each sequence, domains and their names are shown, they can be clicked to obtain a short description and the external link to Pfam. Protein regions not mapped to domains are shown using the standard amino acid color codes, while gap regions are represented by a flat line. # Tree images have been also simplified to improve readability. Mappings and/or cross-linking to general and organism-oriented databases has been extended to include the major Arabidopsis thaliana sequence database TAIR, Drosophila‚Äôs Flybase, as well as the Ascomycete-based genome database Genolevures. # Speciation and duplication events are indicated using different node colors and branch support values are now automatically highlighted for lowly supported partitions using a transparent red bubble inversely proportional to the branch bootstrap or aLRT value. # Internal tree searches can be performed for any of the annotated node attributes while links to other databases are provided through the contextual menu of the tree browser that appear when clicking any node. Also, users can download relevant data, including the whole database, a specific phylome or, from the tree entry page, the relevant data corresponding to that tree.

Early life Kline was born on May 19, 1991, in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania, and is currently living in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. America's Next Top Model In 2011, Kline appeared in cycle 16 of the CW Network reality television show America's Next Top Model, in which she competed against thirteen other aspiring models. Kline eventually went on to become the winner of that cycle, winning a US$ contract with CoverGirl Cosmetics, a contract with IMG Models, the cover of Beauty In Vogue and fashion spreads in Vogue Italia and Beauty In Vogue. Kline garnered some negative attention after an angry confrontation on the set of a photo shoot between her and another contestant, Alexandria Everett, during the cycle's 7th episode. The heated verbal exchange between the two was brought up for discussion during that episode's deliberation by judge Nigel Barker, and after being reprimanded by the judges for her behavior, Kline left the set in tears. She ultimately landed in the bottom two with fellow contestant Mikaela Schipani, but was allowed to remain in the competition. Host Tyra Banks notably stated that she'd wanted to eliminate Kline, but was unable to do so after having been outvoted by the other judges. Kline later apologized for her behavior the following week. Post show career Kline stated that she would be going to Paris in June 2011 to shoot her Vogue Italia spread and moved to New York City with fellow contestant, and runner-up, Molly O'Connell in July 2011. She had an advertorial for United Colors of Benetton in Vogue Mexico. She also had a spread in Vogue Italia, Beauty in Vogue, and a cover of Beauty in Vogue as part of her ANTM prize package. Kline announced on her official page on Facebook that she was leaving IMG Models due to health concerns and consequently her modeling career. She returned to her hometown in early 2012 to finish her degree. She lives with her boyfriend of five years, Erik, and two cats. She has since been removed from the IMG Models website. In January 2013, she returned to modeling and signed with mother agent and photographer Manny Roman. Since then, she has signed with multiple agencies and has walked for Balenciaga and Prabal Gurung at NYFW. She also appeared twice in Interview Magazine and booked work for Acne Studios, Sportmax Code, and Bimba y Lola.http://models.com/models/britt-kline She attended Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, studying Spanish language and English writing. She graduated from LHU in December 2015 with honors and as a member of Sigma Tau Delta. She plans to continue working as a model as long as opportunities are presented. Eventually, she plans to branch off into writing. She hopes to someday publish a memoir and explore the possibilities of writing children's books, travel pieces, and poetry.

Biography Shrayer-Petrov was born of Jewish parents in Leningrad. Both of Shrayer-Petrov's parents, Petr (Peysakh) Shrayer and Bella Breydo, moved from the former Pale of Settlement to Leningrad (St. Petersburg) in the 1920s to attend college. Shrayer-Petrov spent his early prewar years in Leningrad and was evacuated from the besieged city to a village in the Ural Mountains. The future writer and his mother returned to Leningrad in the summer of 1944, his father serving as a captain, and, subsequently, a major, in a tank brigade, and, subsequently, a lieutenant commander in the Baltic Fleet. In 1959, Shrayer-Petrov graduated from Leningrad First Medical School and subsequently served in the army as a physician. In 1966 he received a Ph.D. from the Leningrad Institute of Tuberculosis. He married Emilia Polyak (Shrayer)http://sites.bu.edu/russianchat/interviews/interview-emilia-shrayer/ in 1962, and their son Maxim D. Shrayer was born in 1967, already after the family moved from Leningrad to Moscow. From 1967 to 1978 Shrayer-Petrov worked as a researcher at the Gamaleya Institute of Microbiology in Moscow. He was fired from a senior research position after his decision to apply for an exit visa. In 1979-1987 Shrayer-Petrov and his family were refuseniks and endured persecution by the Soviet authorities. Shrayer-Petrov entered the literary scene as a poet and translator in the late 1950s. Upon the suggestion of Boris Slutsky, the poet adopted the penname David Petrov. This assimilatory gesture did not simplify the publication of Shrayer-Petrov's poetry in the Soviet Union. Most of his writings were too controversial for Soviet officialdom and remained in the writer's desk drawer or circulated in samizdat. Shrayer- Petrov's first collection of verse, Canvasses, did not appear until 1967. With great difficulty Shrayer-Petrov was admitted to the Union of Soviet Writers in 1976, upon the recommendation of Viktor Shklovsky, Lev Ozerov and Andrei Voznesensky. His poem ‚ÄúMy Slavic Soul‚Äù brought repressive measures against the author. A Jewish refusenik expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers, Shrayer- Petrov was unable to publish in the USSR; galleys of two of his books were broken in retaliation for his decision to emigrate. In spite of bullying and arrests by the KGB, Shrayer-Petrov's last Soviet decade was productive; he wrote two novels, several plays, a memoir, and many stories and verses. He was granted permission to emigrate in 1987. Shrayer-Petrov's best-known novel, Doctor Levitin (known in Russian as Herbert and Nelly), was the first to depict the exodus of Soviet Jews and the life of refuseniks in limbo. Since the publication of its first part in Israel in 1986, Herbert and Nelly has gone through three editions, most recently in 2014 in Moscow. Its English translation appeared in 2018.https://www.jta.org/2018/12/18/culture/40-years- ago-a-refusenik-made-art-of-the-soviet-jewish-tragedy-at-82-he-is-seeing-its- first-english-translation After a summer in Italy, in August 1987 Shrayer- Petrov and his family arrived in Providence, RI, the home of David Shrayer- Petrov and Emilia Shrayer for the next twenty years. In Providence he worked as a medical researcher at Brown University-Roger Williams Hospital (Dr. Shrayer has published almost 100 scientific articles in microbiology and immunology). Emigration brought forth a stream of new literary works and publications. The writer and his wife currently reside in Brookline, MA, where Shrayer-Petrov devotes himself to writing full-time. The works of David Shrayer-Petrov have been translated into English, Belarusian, Croatian, French, Hebrew, Japanese, Georgian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Polish, and other languages.

He testified about child poverty to the United States Senate in 1986. Shames was named a Purpose Prize Fellow in 2010 by Encore.org for his work helping AIDS orphans and former child soldiers in Africa. Photography Shames is the author of ten photography book monographs: Stephen Shames, Une Retrospective (Maison de la Photographie Robert Doisneau de Gentilly), Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers (Abrams, 2016), co-authored with Bobby Seale, Outside the Dream: Child Poverty in America (Aperture), Pursuing the Dream: What Helps Children and Their Families Succeed(Aperture), The Black Panthers (Aperture), Bronx Boys (University of Texas Press, 2014), Facing Race, Free to Grow, and Transforming Lives; and an electronic book Bronx Boys (FotoEvidence, 2011). Shames wrote and directed two videos: Friends of the Children and Children of Northern Uganda. He produced a video with Ascencion Films: Sanyu & Ronald. Shames was represented by and had three solo shows at the Steven Kasher Gallery in New York until it closed in December, 2018. He is affiliated with Polaris Images photo agency in New York.

He has received the Kodak Crystal Eagle Award for Impact in Photojournalism, and awards from Leica, International Center of Photography, Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards, World Press, and the New York Art Director‚Äôs Club. American Photo / Pop Photo named Shames one of the 15 most underrated masters of photography. Child poverty work From 1984 to 1989, with support from the Children's Defense Fund and the Alicia Patterson Foundation, Shames traveled across America photographing the lives of the one out of five children in the United States who live below the poverty line. The photographs were published by Aperture in 1991 as Outside the Dream with an introduction by Jonathan Kozol. Shames' work documenting child poverty was also featured in the New York Times, as well as the Los Angeles Times. Senator Bill Bradley said about the work: ‚ÄúJust as Walker Evans‚Äô photographs helped America see the poverty of Appalachia, the vivid images in Outside the Dream will open our hearts to the deprivation that today afflicts not a region, but an entire generation.‚Äù In 1993, copies of Outside the Dream were distributed to every member of Congress, the governors of all 50 states, selected state legislators, and the chief executive officers of the Fortune 500 companies. From 1994 to 1996, with support from the Ford Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, Shames worked on a follow-up project to Outside the Dream that focused on community solutions to child poverty in America. The work was published in 1997 as Pursuing the Dream: What Helps Children and Their Families Succeed and includes a preface by Michael Jordan. Shames traveled across America documenting families participating in neighborhood programs where parents were empowered to learn the skills they needed to become better parents, get better jobs, and become role models for their children. President Jimmy Carter wrote about the book: ‚ÄúStephen Shames has captured the spirit of thousands of programs across our country that are quietly but stubbornly making the lives of children and families better in spite of the bleak circumstances in which they live. ‚Ä¶ This book can inspire all of us to seek out the many opportunities already available in their own communities to make a difference in the lives of others.‚Äù Humanitarian work in Africa In 2006, Shames founded L.E.A.D Uganda, an NGO in Africa that locates forgotten children (AIDS orphans, former child soldiers, child laborers, and children living in Internally Displaced Person camps) and molds them into leaders by sending them to the best schools and colleges. One of the students was highlighted in a People Magazine feature in 2007. In 2012 Shames retired as Executive Director and returned to photography full-time. Current Work: Exhibits, Books, and Climate Change Shames is currently working on exhibitions and books highlighting his previous work including the 1960s, Children & Youth, and a Retrospective. In 2018 Shames produced The Water Bottle Project, a set of 42 glass water bottles with photographs on the labels. The idea of the Water Bottle Project is to create an art object that will remind us of the importance of water to our lives and the life of our planet. Labels featuring photographs of water use around the world on water bottles contrast images of water use with bottled water as an expensive commodity. Without water we die‚Äîalong with all land based plants and animals. Today access to clean water is in jeopardy. Today approximately one billion people lack access to safe water and over 2.5 billion lack access to adequate sanitation. It will get worse. By 2025 more than half of the people of the world will face water vulnerability. The Water Bottle Project creates an art object that reminds us we need to take action.

Built in 1900, it was first used as an exhibition hall, a cinema and then a theatre. It burned down in 1917. The northern part of the building was purchased by CCC and opened as the civic office in 1924, and served this purpose until 1980. After that it had several uses, including a restaurant, bar and live music venue. The building was heavily damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, and was demolished. The Civic was a Category II heritage building registered with the New Zealand Historic Places Trust. History =Agricultural and Industrial Hall= Construction of the Agricultural and Industrial Hall in 1900 The Agricultural and Industrial Hall, also known as the Canterbury Hall, was built in 1900 at 192‚Äì194 Manchester Street. The foundation stone was laid by Mayor William Reece on 14 March 1900. William Albert Paxton Clarkson and Robert Anderson Ballantyne, architects trading as Clarkson & Ballantyne, designed the building for the 50th jubilee of Christchurch, celebrating the arrival of the First Four Ships in December 1850. The contractors were Rennie and Pearce. The Canterbury Industrial Association, a branch of the New Zealand Industrial Association, was the driving force behind the building. Together with the Agricultural and Pastoral Association, an Agricultural and Industrial Hall Company was formed that owned the building. Samuel Brown, the president of the New Zealand Industrial Association, called it \\"possibly the finest hall in New Zealand\\". Canterbury Hall prior to burning down in 1917 Plan for the jubilee exhibition The building was formally opened on 1 November 1900 by the Mayoress, Mrs Reece. Later that afternoon, the Governor, The Earl of Ranfurly, opened the jubilee exhibition. The Premier's party consisted of Richard Seddon, Joseph Ward and families. The day was declared as a public holiday from noon. The exhibition covered and took up two thirds of the city block described by Manchester, Gloucester, Worcester Streets and Latimer Square. It closed on 31 January 1901, having been visited by nearly 250,000 people, with a surplus of ¬£3000. =His Majesty's Theatre= The Canterbury Hall was then used as a cinema, seating 3,000. In 1906, the building was converted to a theatre with a seating capacity of 1,400, and the name was changed to His Majesty's Theatre. The remodelled building was opened with the premier of the comic opera Erminie on 28 August 1906. Fuller's leased the theatre for a period of ten years in early 1917, but tragedy struck on 11 November of that year when the building was gutted by fire. The building, valued at ¬£21,000, was lost, with only the fa√ßade left standing. The city organ, which was donated by the Government after the 1906 New Zealand International Exhibition, valued at ¬£5,000 and insured for ¬£3,750 was also consumed by the flames. The building had only recently been offered to the Christchurch City Council as a town hall. =Municipal offices= The Civic in 1925 with a portico Christchurch City Council started looking for new civic offices in 1919, as the existing offices, these days known as Our City, had become too small. CCC bought the northern part (194 Manchester Street) of the burned out shell in 1920 for their new municipal offices. The southern half of the old building at 192 Manchester Street opened as the Civic Theatre on 17 March 1928. C. R. Dawe and Francis Willis were the architects for the theatre. That building was demolished in 1983, truncating the impressive 1900 fa√ßade by half. Greenstreet and Anderson were engaged as architects for the civic offices, and W. Williamson was engaged as a builder in 1922. Monica Thacker, the mayoress, laid the foundation stone. The building was opened on 1 September 1924. The design was based on an American banking chamber, where one continuous desk in the form of a horseshoe in the main hall gave access for the public to every department of the council. An imposing portico was built over the footpath, but this was later demolished. All council staff (apart from specialist services like the electricity department) were once again under one roof, but this lasted only until 1943. With an increase in the number of staff, and other municipalities amalgamating with Christchurch City Council, council started housing some staff in other buildings. By 1978, council staff were in nine different buildings. The new Christchurch Town Hall was built in Kilmore Street, over the Avon River from Victoria Square, and opened in 1972. Part II of this civic area were supposed to be new civic offices as a replacement for the building in Manchester Street. It was envisaged to build on the corner of Kilmore and Durham Streets, cutting Victoria Street off from going through Victoria Square, but this scheme did not proceed. Instead, the city council purchased Miller's Department Store in Tuam Street in 1978 and fitted this building out as the new civic offices, occupying the building in 1980. The City Council sold the Civic in 1982 for $760,000. =Post 1982= Elemeno P performing at the Civic The Civic has had several owners and different uses. In 1984, it was the Civic Regency Restaurant. It was renamed The Civic in 1986 and was a bar, and then served as a live music venue, with acts by Salmonella Dub, Shapeshifter, Elemeno P and Anika Moa. It also hosted night time performances of the annual buskers festival. The Civic stopped hosting music events in 2009. =Demise= The collapsed fa√ßade of the Civic after the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake The Civic was heavily damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Much of the fa√ßade collapsed into Manchester Street. The building was demolished in 2011. Following the earthquake, a time capsule was found in the building. It was opened on 12 April 2011 by mayor Bob Parker, together with two further capsules found in the plinth of the toppled Godley Statue. The time capsule from the Civic contained newspapers, a book with photos and the council's balance sheet and statements for the year ended 31 March 1921.

Although designed in the UK manufacture of household products has been moved to China. It has facilities in the UK, USA and Canada, and claims to have about 40% of the UK market and to be a leading brand in other countries including Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Chile and Portugal. It is a subsidiary of HoMedics, a US- based manufacturer of \\"personal wellness\\" products. History The firm began life in the late 1760s in the village of Bilston, England when Richard Salter, a spring maker, began making the first spring scales in Britain. He called these scales \\"pocket steelyards\\", though they work on a different principle from steelyard balances. By 1825 his nephew George had taken over the company, which became known as George Salter & Co. George later established a manufacturing site in the town of West Bromwich, about 4 miles (7 km) from Bilston. West Bromwich Albion football club was formed from workers at this works site. From here the company produced a wide variety of scales including the UK's first bathroom scales. Other items were added to the range, including irons, mincers, potato chippers, coin-operated machines and the first typewriters made in the UK. The business thrived throughout the 1900s, and by 1950 it employed over 2000 people, still in the same area and owned by the same family. Late 20th century to present In 1972 the company was purchased by Staveley Industries Plc and was split into separate subsidiaries: housewares, industrial, etc., relocating as required. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Staveley acquired more businesses worldwide to form a new \\"weighing group\\", including the Weigh-Tronix company of America, and in 1998 after a management buyout (MBO), this became the Weigh-Tronix Corporation, with Salter Housewares a part of that. The focus of the new corporation was increasingly towards industrial or commercial weighing, and in February 2002 the management team at Salter Housewares Ltd. bought the company out from the group to concentrate on its consumer businesses. The MBO was backed by Barclays Private Equity to the sum of ¬£18 million (‚Ç¨28m). The company grew rapidly for the next two years, and in March 2004 it was sold to HoMedics, a US-based manufacturer of \\"personal wellness\\" products, generating an internal rate of return (IRR) of approximately 70% for Barclays Private Equity. In 2006, Salter Housewares USA and Taylor Precision Products Inc. (also owned by HoMedics) merged their sales, marketing and distribution operations. The company has since closed its historic factory in West Bromwich, England and shifted manufacture to China. The site has been sold for redevelopment.https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2013/06/27/former-salter- site-is-levelled/ See also * Avery Weigh-Tronix * Phil Drabble - a former director References External links *Salter Housewares *HoMedics *George Salter and Co - Grace's Guide *About Salter - infomat.net Manufacturing companies of the United Kingdom Companies based in the West Midlands (county) ","title":"Salter Housewares"},{"id":"31542939","text":"Hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA) is a rare, fatal amyloid disease in young people in Iceland caused by a mutation in cystatin C.

It was an internal conflict between Solomon, King of Hungary and his cousins duke G√©za and Ladislaus, who were claiming rights to the throne. Solomon ruled for a few years, during which he allegedly submitted the country to the Holy Roman Empire as a vassal state to ensure his power over the kingdom at fear of his relatives usurping the throne. After a series of campaigns directed against the Byzantine Empire, which were led by Duke G√©za and Ladislaus, Solomon grew bitter and felt unappreciated because of their success on the field. This provoked numerous actions of the king on their expense and was eventually followed up by attempts of murder. The princes decided to settle this in a battle and it ended favorably for them thanks to the assistance of Otto I of BrnoWertner M√≥r. (1892). Az √Årp√°dok csal√°di T√∂rt√©nete. Pleitz Fer.

The cartoon revolves around Bluto trying to escape the draft but ends up fighting alongside Popeye against some Japanese spies, Hirohito and Adolf Hitler. Plot While Bluto is busy at work in his stable he receives a letter calling him for his draft service in the Navy. Bluto is very reluctant to join in and pretends to be ill. Popeye, who works at the draft bureau, is suspicious and sends a female dummy in to create an enthusiastic reaction from him. Even though his trick works Bluto still refuses to join the Navy. In a desperate effort to become disabled Bluto jumps out of the window, followed by Popeye who tries to catch him. They both crash deep into the ground, in fact so deep that Satan himself asks them to leave Hell. After Bluto and Popeye have climbed out of the massive crater Satan is kicked by an angel, after which they both disappear. Bluto tries to flee, but is hit in a car accident. Even though he is knocked out the ambulance is only interested in the tires of the vehicle and carries these away on a stretcher instead of Bluto. Bluto tries to get hit by a falling safe instead, but again Popeye rescues him. This angers Bluto so much that he locks Popeye inside the object and then throws it away. It crashes inside an orphanage, where several Imperial Japanese Army spies are undercover, dressed as babies. While Popeye is being beaten by the spies, Bluto drops by to inform him that his arms are bandaged and that he finally will be able to escape the draft. When Bluto sees that Popeye is in trouble, he tries to help, but both men are knocked out by the Japanese. While they are being ridiculed, Popeye grabs his spinach, eats it and gives some to Bluto (can and all). Both men defeat the Japanese and Popeye's fist reaches so far that he knocks out Hirohito. The Emperor is hit so hard that he falls on the backside of his horse, (creating a pun on the word \\"ass\\"), and says: \\"It should happen to Hitler!\\" Sure enough, the next scene cuts to Hitler, who gives a speech by saying: \\"B.O.!\\" (\\"body odor\\", a reference to a Lifebuoy soap commercial). Hitler too is beaten so hard that he loses his mustache. A title card appears, asking: \\"Is there a doctor in the house?\\", with the word \\"doctor\\" crossed out and \\"undertaker\\" written in crayon. While he lies unconscious, Hermann G√∂ring runs in and asks his F√ºhrer melodramatically \\"to speak to him\\". Hitler just says \\"B.O.\\" again, whereupon G√∂ring pulls his face away in disgust. The cartoon concludes with Bluto finally signing up for his draft. When Bluto asks how to spell his own name, the imprisoned Japanese spies sing \\"B-L-U-T-O\\", in reference to the commercial jingle for Jell-o from that time. Notability The cartoon is notable for being one of the few where Bluto and Popeye actually fight together to beat a common foe. Because of its dated references to World War II and offensive racial stereotyping of Japanese people, it is no longer shown on US television. The style of the cartoon is more reminiscent of a Looney Tunes or Tex Avery cartoon, with wild, frenetic takes and fourth wall breaking gags geared at adults. Some of the jokes, like the use of the phrase \\"B.O.\\" were used in several of Looney Tunes cartoons as well. This cartoon's score also features an excerpt of the tune of \\"I Don't Want To Walk Without You\\" which was first heard onscreen in Paramount's movie Sweater Girl.

One of the first Soviet diplomats, Vorovsky is best remembered as the victim of a May 1923 political assassination in Lausanne, Switzerland, where he was the official representative of the Soviet government to the Conference of Lausanne. Biography =Early years= Vatslav Vorovsky was born October 27, 1871 (n.s.) in Moscow, the son of an ethnic Polish engineer.Branko Lazitch with Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 498‚Äì499. Following the completion of secondary school, Vorovsky enrolled at the University of Moscow, where he was exposed to the ideas of political radicalism. =Political career= Vorovsky became active in the socialist movement in 1895. He was arrested by the Tsarist secret police shortly thereafter and sentenced to three years' exile in the city of Orlov. Upon his release, Vorovsky adopted a new underground pseudonym, \\"P. Orlovsky,\\" as a tribute to this experience. During the course of his underground career, Vorovsky also used the pseudonyms \\"Y. Adamovich,\\" \\"M. Schwarz,\\" \\"Josephine,\\" and \\"Felix Alexandrovich.\\" Vorovsky emigrated to Europe in 1902, spending time in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1903 he affiliated himself with the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, becoming an editor of the official organ of the party, Vperyod (Forward), in 1905. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, Vorovsky returned to Russia, working actively as a revolutionary in St. Petersburg. Following the defeat of the 1905 uprising he moved to Odessa in Kherson Governorate, where he was a leading underground Bolshevik from 1907 to 1912. In 1912, Vorovsky was arrested again, this time to be deported to Europe. Vorovsky returned to Russia in 1915, landing in Petrograd ‚Äî the new name of St. Petersburg ‚Äî but he was soon sent to Stockholm by a business firm. He was the first director of Gosizdat, the State Publishing House, from its foundation in 1919 until 1921. =Diplomatic career= Following the victory of the Bolshevik Revolution in November 1917, Vorovsky was named the Soviet government's diplomatic representative to Scandinavia, remaining based in Stockholm. In Stockholm, Vorovsky was the point of contact between the new Bolshevik government and representatives of the government of Germany, being introduced by Alexander Parvus to such luminaries of the German Social-Democratic Party as Philipp Scheidemann during November and December 1917.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917‚Äì1923: Volume 3. London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 23. In December 1918, Sweden, responding to pressure on the part of the Allied powers who were intent upon imposing an unbreakable blockade, withdrew official recognition of Vorovsky as the representative of Soviet Russia.Louis Fischer, The Soviets in World Affairs: A History of the Relations between the Soviet Union and the Rest of the World, 1917‚Äì1929. Second Edition. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1951; vol. 1, pg. 248. This action on the part of the Swedish government forced Vorovsky's return to Russia the following month.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 114, fn. 1. This action taken against Vorovsky followed the actions taken by Great Britain in expelling Maxim Litvinov in September 1918 and that of Germany in expelling Adolph Joffe in November of that same year.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pp. 113‚Äì114. In March 1919, Vorovsky served as a member of the Soviet delegation to the Founding Congress of the Communist International. He was named the representative of the Russian Communist Party to the Executive Committee of the Comintern. He also served as one of the secretaries of the organization, along with Angelica Balabanova.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 121. Grigorii Zinoviev was tapped as president of the organization. In July 1920, Vorovsky resumed work as a Soviet diplomat, participating in diplomatic negotiations with Poland. From 1921 to 1923, Vorovsky was the Soviet representative to Italy. In that capacity he was involved in attempts at negotiation of a trade agreement between the two countries, with a preliminary pact signed in December 1921.Carole Fink, The Genoa Conference: European Diplomacy, 1921‚Äì1922. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1984; pg. 282. This success proved short-lived, however, as negotiations to extend the six-month treaty failed in May 1922. Vorovsky was a member of the Soviet delegation to the 1922 Genoa Conference, a group headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Georgii Chicherin. =Death and legacy= Vorovsky's final diplomatic mission came in the spring of 1923, when he served as Soviet representative to the Lausanne conference of 1923. Accompanied by two diplomatic attach√©s, Vorovsky arrived in Lausanne from Rome on April 27, hoping to force the conference's official participants to recognize Soviet interests in the Turkish Black Sea Straits.Fischer, The Soviets in World Affairs, vol. 1, pg. 409. On May 9, Vorovsky dispatched his final report to Moscow, noting that three days earlier a group of right wing youths had appeared at his hotel and sought a meeting. Vorovsky wrote: > \\"I refused to receive them, and Comrade Ahrens, who went out to them to find > out what it was all about, disposed of them at once, telling them that they > should put such matters before their Government. Now they are going about > the town declaring that they will compel us to leave Switzerland by force, > and so on. \\"As to whether the police are taking any measures for our safety, > we have no idea.

On the evening of May 10, 1923, Vorovsky was seated at a dining table in the restaurant of his hotel with his colleagues when the group was approached by an individual they did not know. The unknown figure, a Russian White √©migr√© named Maurice Conradi, pulled a gun and shot Vorovsky to death, wounding his two companions, Ahrens and Divilkovsky, in the attack. Conradi was defended by the advocate Th√©odore Aubert and later acquitted by the Swiss court in the epilogue of what would be known as the Conradi affair. It was later alleged that the murder was actually ordered by Stalin.Vaksberg, Toxic Politics: The Secret History of the Kremlin's Poison Laboratory pp. 23,24.

It was transplanted to Kew Gardens where it flowered in August 1911, and the species was first described by William Grant Craib from that plant and the wild collections in 1911. pages 418‚Äì419 Culture as houseplant It can be difficult to find a fully vined Hoya kerri at a reasonable price. Garden centres and large box stores often stock Hoya kerrii as a single leaf cutting. The cutting's heart shape makes it a popular purchase for Valentine's day. The leaf readily roots and remains a planted heart for many months if not years. These are largely considered novelty items as very few single leaf cuttings develop into mature plants. In order for a leaf cutting to sprout a vine, part of the stem and a node is required from the mother plant. Even if a stem and node are present, it can take several years before new growth is observed.

Market structure There are over 30000 traders in the market selling all kinds of wares from used clothing to food to car spare parts. Fires Due to the congested nature of the market, when ever fires start in it the damage is always extensive. With the destruction of good and structures running into several thousands of cedis. There are no fire hydrants in the market making it almost impossible to refill fire tenders which run out of water during fires. This story is similar to other markets in the country such as Kotokoraba market, Market Circle and the Kejetia market. The latest fire outbreak in the market occurred on Tuesday, 19 April 2011. Raging fire engulfed a number of shops at the market. The cause of the fire was believed to have been due to a welder whose welding machine burst into flames. Traders' concerns As the market gets increasing congested, many traders have aired concerns ranging from expansion works to be done, improved fire safety to prevention of ejection. In February 2011 the Kantamanto Traders Association (KTA) appealed to the Government of Ghana to suspend the ejection and expansion work being undertaken by the management of Ghana Railway Development Authority (GRDA) until an alternative place to accommodate the over 30,000 traders at the Kantamanto market has been acquired.

She undertook research on the life histories of insects, describing several species new to science and wrote extensively on entomology. Murtfeldt created a collection of plant specimens that contributed to the scientific knowledge on the plants of Missouri. Life Murtfeldt was born in New York City on the 6th of August 1839 to Esther and Charles W. Murtfeldt. She grew up in Rockford, Illinois but lived most of her adult life with her family in Kirkwood, Missouri. She was partially paralysed by polio in her youth and as a result her ability to walk was restricted.Margaret W. Rossiter, Women scientists in America: struggles and strategies to 1940, JHU Press, 1984, p. 347 Murtfeldt was educated at home but went on to study at Rockford College from 1858 to 1860. She developed an interest in entomology and botany. This interest was encouraged by the then Missouri state entomologist Charles Valentine Riley who lived with the Murtfeldt family around 1870. Murtfeldt began publishing scientific papers in 1872. She was employed as the assistant to the Missouri State entomologist from 1876 to 1877. Murtfeldt then became a field agent at the Bureau of Entomology of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. She served in that position from 1880‚Äî1893. From 1896 She was employed at the St Louis Republic, becoming the staff contributor in botany and entomology, and editing the journal Farm Progress. During the 1870s Murtfeldt investigated the life histories of insects, particularly moths, and described several new species. The work was used by the Missouri State entomologist (Riley) in his much admired reports. She published a significant body of work including texts used to introduce farmers and horticulturalists to entomology as well as a text book on insects used to educate school children. She also worked at the interface between entomology and botany researching the pollination of the Yucca plant by moths. She created a significant collection of plant species from the St Louis, Missouri area.Popular Science Monthly, vol. 74, p. 252 These specimens assisted Samuel Mills Tracy when writing his Flora of Missouri.

She served two commissions with the Royal Navy: from February 1942 to August 1944 and from August 1944 to April 1946. She was then held in reserve until August 1957 and eventually sold to the Turkish Navy, who renamed her TCG Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa. She was struck from the Turkish Navy list and scrapped in 1971. Adoptions Maidenhead Borough Council in Berkshire officially adopted HMS Matchless after holding a Warship Week in March 1942 that raised ¬£550,296. A ship's badge was presented to the borough in September 1942. Associated Motor Cycles in southeast London, which made Matchless motorcycles, unofficially adopted the ship in 1943. After the Battle of the North Cape in December 1943 her battle flag and other mementoes were presented to the company. Service =Scapa Flow= Matchless undertook sea trials in the Firth of Clyde and then joined the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow for crew training in gunnery and torpedo attacks. Her first active service was on an Arctic convoy to Murmansk and the Kola Inlet. On 13 May 1942 she was one of four destroyers that sailed from Murmansk escorting the light cruiser , which had been damaged during a previous convoy and partially repaired for her homeward voyage. On 15 May 20 Ju 88 bombers attacked the flotilla and one bomb set Trinidad on fire and crippled her. Matchless rescued over 200 survivors and then scuttled Trinidad by torpedoing her. =Malta= In June 1942 Matchless took part in Operation Harpoon: a heavily armed convoy to relieve the besieged island of Malta. The convoy sailed from Gibraltar on 12 June and Matchless was damaged by a mine off Malta on 15 June. This forced her to remain in Malta for repairs, where she survived 265 air raids. In August she sailed from Malta disguised as an Italian warship. She reached Gibraltar just in time to join Operation Pedestal, which was the next convoy to relieve Malta. =Arctic Convoys= After Operation Pedestal, Matchless escorted two successful Arctic convoys from Loch Ewe to the Kola Inlet: JW 51A in December 1942 and JW 51B in December and January. In May and June 1943 Matchless escorted the ocean liner part-way across the North Atlantic while the liner was carrying Winston Churchill to the United States. She then escorted further Arctic convoys: JW 54B in November 1943 and JW 55A in December 1943. Sinking Scharnhorst On 24‚Äì25 December 1943 Matchless was returning from the Kola Inlet escorting Convoy RA 55A when she and three other destroyers were ordered to detach from that convoy and join a JW convoy heading for Russia. It was believed the German battleship might be on the point of leaving her Norwegian fjord base to attack the convoys. On Christmas Day came a message that the 10th Cruiser Squadron consisting of , & , under Vice Admiral Robert Burnett had been in action against Scharnhorst. Her mission was to attack the convoys, but she had been ordered to avoid battle with heavy Allied units. Accordingly, she disengaged from the cruisers and with her superior speed was soon out of contact. Vice-Admiral Burnett believed she might be heading north to attack the convoys: Acting on that assumption he also headed north & on Boxing Day did in fact make contact again, with exchange of shots, during which the Norfolk was hit. Scharnhorst disengaged again and headed south for the safety of her Altafjord base. The cruisers & destroyers took up a shadowing role. Burnett was aware that a heavier Royal Navy force commanded by Admiral Bruce Fraser aboard the battleship was steaming from the west to intercept her. Admiral Erich Bey aboard Scharnhorst was not aware. About 5.15pm the black of the winter Arctic night was lit up as bright as day by starshells, & the battle began in earnest. Outnumbered, outgunned, surrounded, her retreat cut off, there could be only one end. She was weakened first by shellfire from Duke of York, then by torpedoes from the cruiser , British and Norwegian destroyers. Finally the destroyer detachment from Convoy JW 55A, including Matchless, closed in and sank Scharnhorst with a further 19 torpedoes going under around 7.15pm. Only 36 survivors were recovered; Matchless picking up six of them. =Return to Home Fleet= After the battle, Matchless returned to Scapa Flow, resumed duties with the Home Fleet and performed escort duties including further Arctic convoys until August 1944. She was then paid off in Hull, but after repairs and a re-fit she was recommissioned later the same month. Matchless saw further service in the Mediterranean until 1945, and was then decommissioned in April 1946. =Laid Up= Matchless was then laid up off Portchester Castle in Hampshire where she was held in reserve until at least 1957. Along with three other ships of the same class she was transferred to the Turkish Navy as part of an agreement signed at Ankara on 16 August 1957. They underwent a refit which involved the removal of the after set of torpedo tubes and some secondary armament. They received a new deckhouse and Squid anti-submarine weapons system. On 29 June 1959 they were handed over at Portsmouth. Matchless, which was refitted at Harland & Wolff's shipyard at Govan, Glasgow, was commissioned as TCG Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa (D-350) after an Italian-born 16th century Turkish admiral, Ulu√ß Ali Reis (1519‚Äì87).Blackman, Raymond V B, Jane's Fighting Ships 1963-4, Sampson Low, Marston & Co. Ltd, London, p. 248 She served in the Turkish Navy until 1971, when she was struck from the list and scrapped. Heritage After the war an HMS Matchless Association was formed to unite personnel who had served aboard her. The ship's badge that was presented to Maidenhead Borough Council in 1942 has since been lost. For a time the ship's battle flag from the Battle of the North Cape hung in the Directors' Office at Associated Motor Cycles' factory in Plumstead. The flag, along with a photograph of the ship and a letter from her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander J. Mowlam, were lost after AMC went into receivership in 1966.

Following the end of the war, Williams was granted the rank of honorary brigadier on 30 December 1946, the date of which he retired from active service. Cricket Williams was an able sportsman, taking a particular interest in cricket. Having played cricket for Winchester College in 1909 and 1910, it would not be until after the First World War that he would make his first-class debut. This came in 1922 for the Combined Services against Essex. He played cricket on a first-class level not only for the Combined Services, but also for the British Army, who he played for on 22 occasions, as well as captaining them in some matches. Williams was an able batsman, were it not for his military career it can be assumed he would have played county cricket to some degree. In 22 matches for the Army, he 1,630 runs at a batting average of 45.27, which made him one of the Army's stand out players of the twenties. He made three centuries and seven half centuries for the Army. Williams had two stand out first-class seasons with the bat, scoring 366 runs in five innings at an average of 73.20. In that season he scored his maiden double century against Oxford University when opening the batting in the Army first-innings.

This came for the Army against the Royal Navy. Williams additionally played first-class cricket for the Free Foresters to some degree of success, in just three first-class matches for them he scored 220 runs an average of 44.00, with a single century score of 142. His highest score for the Foresters came against Oxford University in 1933. He also played a single first-class match for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1933, against Oxford University.

It takes about fifty minutes to administer, and can be used by mental health professionals of different disciplines after relatively little training. As of 2011 the complete version of the CPRS was seldom used by clinicians or in psychiatric research. However, the ten-item sub-scale for measuring the severity of depression, called the Montgomery √Ösberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), was the most widely used rating scale for assessment of mood both in research and clinical practice.

The industry was traditionally noted for its numerous historical sites, beaches, waterfalls, mountain ranges and national parks. After the start of the civil war in the early 1990s, the Tourism Ministry shut down operations. It was re-established in the 2000s, and once again oversees the national tourist industry. The Mogadishu-based Somali Tourism Association (SOMTA) provides on-the-ground consulting services. History Ruins of the Adal Sultanate in Zeila In the pre-independence period, European explorers would occasionally travel to Somalia and other parts of the Horn of Africa to visit the region's numerous historical sites described in old documents like the 1st century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. Somalia's ecological parks, coral reefs and protected areas Following Somalia's independence in 1960, the Ministry of Tourism was established in order to regulate the national tourist industry. In 1969, the Law on Fauna (Hunting) and Forest Conservation was passed, which defined and provided for the establishment of controlled areas, game reserves and partial game reserves. It was later amended in 1978. Under Mire Aware Jama, the Ministry subsequently passed the Tourism Act in 1984. The bill laid down official guidelines for the development and modernization of the tourism sector. Among its stated aims was the acquisition of land in the interior and on the coast as well as beach properties for the purpose of building or expanding tourist infrastructures. The Act also included provisions for \\"the protection, preservation and utilization of historic, cultural and artisanal resources; the protection and preservation of ecology and environment; and strict urban and regional planning for zones of touristic interest to include game parks, land and sea parks, sanctuaries, etc.\\" The Tourism Ministry sought to center the industry in the vicinity of the southern Lag Badana National Park, with nearby coral reefs and offshore islands likewise envisioned as part of the development. Additionally, plans were drawn up for the formation of a tourist resort area on one of the beaches near the capital Mogadishu, in the south-central Banaadir region.The historic Mogadishu waterfront (1984) By 1989, newer legislation was drafted governing the establishment of national parks, game reserves and special reserves. The conservation of wildlife resources was at this time overseen by the Ministry of Livestock, Forestry and Range's National Range Agency. Its Department of Wildlife also operated an independent law-enforcement unit, which had been created through presidential decree. Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, tourism in Somalia came to a halt. Various international bodies subsequently began issuing travel advisories recommending that potential tourists avoid visiting the area for safety reasons. Aside from a handful of adventure seekers, few travelers ventured to the volatile southern provinces. Most instead limited their visits to the relatively stable northern Puntland and Somaliland regions. After the Somali Armed Forces evicted Al-Shabaab militants from Mogadishu in mid-2011, the capital gradually started to experience a renaissance. Local businessmen and returning Somali expatriates built and opened a number of new hotels and guest houses, mainly catering to other Somalis as well as some Westerners. Newly constructed beachside resorts also accommodated the first tourist families in many years. Regulation Tourism in Somalia is regulated by the reconstituted national Ministry of Tourism. The autonomous Puntland and Somaliland regions maintain their own tourist offices. Somali Tourism Association (SOMTA) also provides consulting services from within the country on the national tourist industry. Due to the long absence of governmental regulation, it is uncertain how many international inbound tourists visit Somalia per year. However, visas and stay permits are now mandatory for all foreign nationals. As of April 2013, the re- established Somali Immigration Department requires all undocumented foreigners to register at its offices in the capital. Attractions One of the forts of the Majeerteen Sultanate (Migiurtinia) in Hafun Somalia has a number of local attractions, including historical sites, beaches, waterfalls, mountain ranges and national parks.

Launched in 1849, she was converted to a troopship in 1851, and sold in 1867 as the barque Jorawur. Weighing 1,747 tons she had 14 gunports, was fitted with fore, main and mizzen masts, a funnel, a stump bowsprit, and a figurehead depicting a male figure holding a hammer. Following a trial on a target representing the side of the ship, it was decided that iron vessels were unsuitable for war purposes, and so Vulcan was completed as a transport.National Maritime Museum Ship history From 1852 until 1855 she was under the command of Edward Pelham Brenton von Donop. Edward Sholto Douglas, R.N., son of the late Major Sholto Douglas, and nephew of the Marchioness of Queensberry, master of , from which ship he was invalided at Rangoon, was lost from HMS Vulcan off Ascension Island on 27 February 1853. His body was recovered and he was buried on the island. During the Crimean War, Vulcan operated in the Black Sea, transporting wounded troops from the battle of the Alma to Constantinople in September 1854, and returning with reinforcements in November. A year later, in November 1855, she was taking Russian prisoners to Constantinople. In May 1858 HMS Vulcan carried 18 officers, 30 sergeants, 16 drummers, and 499 men (also 37 women and 38 children) of the 2nd Battalion, 3rd Regiment of Foot (The Buffs), from England to Malta. Augustus Chetham Strode was appointed to command her in 1859 to serve in the East Indies and China Station, seeing action in combined operations under the command of Brigadier general Charles William Dunbar Staveley during the Taiping Rebellion in 1862. On 25 January 1863, she rescued all 45 crew and 669 passengers from the merchant ship India, which had been wrecked in the Strait of Malacca three days earlier.

She was ordered from Fairfield's, Govan, Glasgow on 7 September 1939 under the 1939 Build Programme and laid down on 7 December the same year. She was launched on 2 December 1941 and completed on 18 September 1942 at a cost of ¬£462,543. Musketeer was adopted in December 1941 by the community of East Barnet, now part of Greater London. Musketeer was the second RN ship to carry this name: the first was a destroyer built in 1919 and sold in 1921. Service =Arctic Convoys= Musketeer commissioned on 9 September 1942 and joined the Home Fleet as part of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla covering the North Sea and the North Western Approaches. In November 1942 she was switched to duty with the convoys to the Soviet Union, protecting merchant shipping delivering vital supplies to Russia for her war against Nazi Germany. This was a role that Musketeer was to perform for most of her wartime service, although from May to September 1943, following a refit, she once again served in the Home Fleet guarding the Western Approaches. On 27 September 1943 she took part in a mission in support of Royal Air Force (RAF) attempts to neutralise the German battleship , when she ferried RAF personnel from the Faroe Islands to Murmansk. Murmansk was the base for reconnaissance flights to Tripitzs anchorage in the Altafjord in Norway. These flights were used in the planning of an eventual RAF bombing raid on the battleship. On 25 February 1944 Musketeer was involved in a collision with the Polish destroyer , breaking off from convoy duty to be taken in hand for repair by Brigham and Cowan shipyard in Hull. Repairs were completed by the end of March 1944 and in early April the ship was again back on Russian convoy duty. =Mediterranean= On 3 October 1944, Musketeer was assigned for service in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Background and professional experience through World War II He was born in Nottingham in 1914, and grew up in West Didsbury and the Peak District of Derbyshire, and attended school in New Mills, a Derbyshire town. In the 1930s he obtained a BSc in Metallurgy at Manchester University and worked as a metallurgist at Samuel Fox's steelworks near Sheffield until World War II broke out.Bucknell, Steve; MEMOIR.

In 1947‚Äì1949 he worked in liaison for the British Non-Ferrous Metals Research Association. Post-World War II After an earlier marriage to Joyce Ambler, he married Ione Mary Wynniatt-Husey on 24 June 1985; she died in 1989. Apart from Lister's competence in technological matters, he has subsequently displayed various other talents; in 1950 he abandoned metallurgy for writing, publishing most of his works under the name R. P. Lister. They include prose novels, autobiographical accounts of travel and other experiences, historical works, and poetry, mainly light verse in various forms and idioms. Apart from his writings he later became in effect a professional artist in response to enthusiasm for his paintings. He also engaged in various related employments, such as in 1954‚Äì1957, when he worked as general editor at Macdonald & Evans Ltd, Publishers.

Recognition and activities Lister's major honour was being voted in as Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (FRSL) 1970. During his most active period of writing, the 1950s to the 1980s, he also produced a variety of essays and reviews, largely for the same genre of magazines as he frequently wrote poetry for, but also for the likes of the New Statesman and Nation in the 1950sreview of Aldous Huxley's The Genius and the Goddess, New Statesman and Nation 16 July 1955, p. 76 His own works were reviewed in similar publications during those times, and also in more specialised publications such as The Library journal book review,The Library journal book review, Pub R.R. Bowker., 1980 On entering the field of professional literature, Lister did not immediately give up writing on matters in his field of technical competence; as late as 1955 at least, he was writing semi-technical articles on metallurgy.Lister, R. P.; Wonder metals. American Society for Metals Metal progress, Volume 67, 1955 His poetic works have appeared in anthologies for many years, such as The Revolutionaries and The Idle Demon, and A Toast to 2000, A Mind Reborn in Streatham Common. and DefenestrationJ. M. Cohen (Ed.); \\"Yet more comic and curious verse\\"; Penguin Books (1959) Something about the word \\"defenestration\\" apparently tickles popular humour; the poem seems to be the most popularly quoted of Lister's light verse, and it was set to music by the group Instant Sunshine. Its erudite tone certainly suits that group's witty and whimsical idiom. Painting In 2010 Lister occasionally still wrote poetry, although his main endeavour from about 1980 on was painting. He explained in the introduction to Nine Legends:Lister, R. P.; Nine Legends; Publisher: Pauline Dorricott (1991) ‚ÄúIn 1980 people started buying my paintings, so I took to painting in all the time I had available to me. Painting from then on occupied me happily and kept me alive for the next ten years.‚Äù On inspecting two of his works shown in his attached portrait, one might suspect that this unlooked-for success in a competitive field could stem partly from a curious talent for combining a playful presentation with serious background material, such as clouds and mountains that are rendered with conviction in paintings that initially give an impression of a childlike style. His readers might find it worth contemplating that aspect in analogy to his writing style; practically everything Lister produced in any medium had something serious at the core.

Origins Thomas III Spring was the eldest son and heir of Thomas II Spring (d. 7 September 1486). of Lavenham (whose monumental brass survives in Lavenham Church), by his wife Margaret Appleton. His father's will mentions Thomas and two other sons, William and James (slain 1493), as well as a daughter, Marian.; . He had another brother, John Spring, whose daughter, Margaret Spring, married Aubrey de Vere, second son of John de Vere, 15th Earl of Oxford and was the grandmother of Robert de Vere, 19th Earl of Oxford.; . The will of Thomas Spring's grandfather, Thomas I Spring (d.1440), mentions his wife, Agnes, his eldest son and heir, Thomas (d. 7 September 1486), another son William, and two daughters, Katherine and Dionyse.. Career Thomas inherited the family wool and cloth business from his father, and during his lifetime the cloth trade was at its most profitable. By the time of his death, Spring was believed to be the richest man in England outside the peerage, having invested much of his money in land.The Cloth Industry of Lavenham Retrieved 25 April 2013.. In 1512, 1513 and 1517 his name appears as one of the commissioners for collecting taxation in Suffolk. He played a large part in defeating supporters of William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who claimed the throne from King Henry VII. However, in 1517 during the reign of Henry VIII, Spring was given exemption from public duties, At which point he was probably at the height of his wealth. Spring is mentioned in John Skelton's satirical poem Why come ye not to Court, which makes reference to a rich clothier with whom Skelton is said to have been friends: :\\"Now nothing, but pay pay with laughe and lay downe Borough, Citie and towne good Springe of Lanam must count what became of his clothe makyng. My Lordes grace will bryng down thys hye Springe and brynge it so lowe it shal not ever flow.\\" Like his father, Thomas Spring was closely involved in the rebuilding of St Peter and St Paul's Church in Lavenham. This was partly done in order to propitiate the 13th Earl of Oxford, who had ordered the reconstruction work and was the other principal donor. The rebuilding also gave Spring an opportunity to display his wealth and generosity, thus solidifying his position in Suffolk; a common motivation behind the construction of many similar so-called \\"wool churches\\". Marriage and issue Thomas Spring married twice: *Firstly, in 1493, to Anne King, of Boxford, Suffolk, by whom he had two sons and two daughters: Sir John Spring (d. 12 August 1547), of Lavenham, eldest son and heir, who married Dorothy Waldegrave, a daughter of Sir William Waldegrave; .

This location is a common starting point for hikers and bicyclists using the Paulinskill Valley Trail. The Blairstown Railway (BRWY) opened in 1877 and ran between Blairstown and Delaware, New Jersey, a distance of approximately 12 miles (19 km). The single-track railroad was built under the direction of railroad magnate John I. Blair, one of the wealthiest persons in the United States at that time, who had previously built the Warren Railroad, and for whom Blairstown is named. History The Blairstown Railway started at what is now Footbridge Park in Blairstown and ended at the Lackawanna Railroad's station, which was located between Clinton and Clarence Streets in Delaware NJ. The BRWY itself never grew beyond its initial size. Legend has it that Blair built the BRWY so that his wife to be able to travel from their home in Blairstown to New York City and back in one day for shopping. Although such a tale is plausible, and serves to give Blair a more human side than he is often given credit for, it would have been completely out of character for the notoriously frugal Blair to have built what would have amounted to an extravagant toy for the occasional use of his seventy-five-year-old wife. Rather, it is far more likely that Blair was aware that there were railroads ‚Äî specifically, the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad and the Lehigh and New England Railroad ‚Äî who were surveying routes through the Blairstown area into Pennsylvania and who might want to use his BRWY as part of their route if he built it before they could. Indeed, given the topography of the Blairstown area, and Blair's penchant for being at least one step ahead of the competition (and ideally holding the trump card too), Blair's strategy was probably to build the BRWY, and wait. Blair would only have to wait four years (1881) before the New Jersey Midland Railroad extended its tracks from Sparta, New Jersey to connect to the BRWY, and through trains began plying the rails of the BRW. Later, the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad (NYS&W;), a corporate successor of the New Jersey Midland RR, and the Lehigh & New England Railroad (L&NE;), a competitor that also needed Blair's route (via trackage rights), would turn Blair's bucolic branchline into a somewhat bustling mainline, albeit for two relatively small players in the railroad arena. Clearly, if it had Blair's intent that the entire BRWY would be used by another railroad to connect to the Lackawanna Railroad at Delaware, he was mistaken. For the L&NE; would use only about six miles of the BRWY (to Hainesburg Junction) and the NYS&W; about nine miles (to a point called Columbia Junction, located about where Interstate 80 crosses Columbia Lake today), with the remainder of the route to Delaware being run as a vestigal branchline. But, perhaps this was Blair's plan all along. Blair would die in 1899 at the age of 97. A dozen years after Blair's death, in 1911, Blairstown would receive a second train station, located about a mile or so up the hill from Blair's station. This one, however, would be located on the Lackawanna Cut-Off. As such, the Hainesburg- Delaware section south of Hainesburg Junction ‚àí the so-called Delaware Branch ‚àí would be abandoned in 1928. The L&NE; went out of business in 1961, resulting in the tracks west of Hainesburg Junction being removed. In 1963, the NYS&W; removed the tracks from Sparta Junction to Blairstown. And, in the late 1980s, the abandoned rail right-of-way between Sparta Junction and Knowlton Township, New Jersey would become the Paulinskill Valley Trail. What remains of the Blairstown Railway today? The train station in Blairstown was located in what is now Footbridge Park. The parking lot for the park was originally a small railyard, complete with passing sidings, a turntable and engine house, and a coaling dock that is still extant (for a while in later years, a skate park was located under the old coaling dock). The footbridge across the Paulinskill River was the second one at the site. The present footbridge was dedicated by Blair himself shortly before his death, and provided direct access between the town of Blairstown and the train station, and later to Footbridge Park. The Blairstown Railway ran adjacent to the opposite side of Station Road in Hainesburg, New Jersey, under the easternmost arch of the Paulins Kill Viaduct on the Lackawanna Cut-Off, as shown in this April 2011 photo. There was no connecting track between the Blairstown Railway and the Lackawanna Cut-Off. Hainesburg Station, on what was the New York, Susquehanna & Western Railroad, was located directly under the viaduct. The remains of the freight station's foundation can clearly be seen in the left-center of the photo. The tracks on the Blairstown Railway were removed from this location in 1963. The Blairstown Railway right-of-way where it passes the Columbia Power Dam near the town of Columbia, New Jersey. Most of the route of the Blairstown Railway, from Blairstown southwest to Delaware, can still be traced today, although parts of the route have ceased to exist. Indeed, the right-of-way from Footbridge Park to Blairstown Airport is still fully intact as the Paulinskill Valley Trail. However, the right-of-way has been severed by the airport, with signage pointing the direction to where the trail continues south of the airport. The trail runs another three miles from there, passing under the Paulins Kill Viaduct, continuing until it passes under Interstate 80, in an unusual pipe tunnel, and then ends near the power dam on the Paulinskill River near Columbia, New Jersey. From there, the old right-of-way can no longer be followed, as it continues only a short distance, and then dead ends on private property. After that, the right-of-way has been mostly obliterated by the widening of U.S. Route 46, traveling along the eastern shore of the Delaware River until the town of Delaware is reached. In Delaware, until 2012, a remaining vestige of the BRW was a short, deep cut high into the steep rock wall on the southern outskirts of town along US Route 46. The western wall of the cut was removed that year to provide a parking lot for Gary Gray Trucking. The rather odd position of the cut is explained by Blair's apparent desire to have his railroad end at, rather than across the tracks from, Delaware Station. Another vestige is the partially filled turntable pit of the BRW, located alongside Delaware Road, just northeast of the village. The Lackawanna Railroad's railroad station in Delaware was torn down in 1968 and the tracks of the old Warren Railroad were removed from the location in 1970.

These 11 highways are service roads related to and sections of an old alignment of MD 31 between New Windsor and Manchester in Carroll County. Between Westminster and Manchester, the sections of MD 852 follow MD 27, which replaced MD 31 north of Westminster in 1967. MD 852 has three distinct sections of mainline highway: MD 852 runs from New Windsor to south of Westminster, MD 852K runs from south of Westminster into the county seat, and MD 852G runs from north of Westminster to Mexico. What are now parts of MD 852 were originally constructed as MD 31 around 1920 south of Westminster and in the early 1910s north of Westminster. The sections of MD 852 were assigned north of Westminster in the late 1950s and south of Westminster in the mid-1960s. Route description View north along MD 852C south of Manchester There are three mainline sections of MD 852: *MD 852 runs from MD 31 in New Windsor east to MD 31 near Westminster. *MD 852K runs from MD 31 near Westminster to Main Street in Westminster. *MD 852G runs from MD 27 in Westminster to MD 27 in Mexico. =New Windsor-Westminster= MD 852 begins at an intersection with MD 31 (New Windsor Road) just east of the town of New Windsor. The state highway heads north as a two-lane undivided road perpendicular to MD 31, then curves east and starts to follow old alignment at its intersection with MD 852M (Old New Windsor Road), which heads southwest to a dead end adjacent to MD 31. MD 852 follows a curvy path through farmland in the Wakefield Valley. After crossing Little Pipe Creek just west of its intersection with Adams Mill Road, the state highway veers to the southeast to parallel the creek. MD 852 runs along the southwestern edge of Wakefield Valley Golf Course before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 31 southwest of Westminster. =Westminster= MD 852K begins at an intersection with MD 31 (New Windsor Road) a short distance east of MD 852's eastern terminus southwest of Westminster. The state highway heads south as two-lane undivided Stone Chapel Road to a three-way intersection where Stone Chapel Road turns west as a county highway. MD 852K turns east onto New Windsor Road. MD 852K closely parallels the eastbound direction of MD 31, serving as a service road for properties on the south side of the two highways. There appears to be a connector between MD 31 and MD 852K at MD 31's intersection with Tahoma Farm Road; however, barriers prevent access between the two highways. Access between the two highways was cut off in 2008 when a traffic signal was added at the MD 31-Tahoma Farm Road intersection. MD 852K diverges from MD 31 just inside the city limit of Westminster. MD 852K becomes municipally-maintained just south of where houses start to line the westbound side of the highway. The state highway climbs to the top of the ridge on which downtown Westminster sits and reaches its eastern terminus at the intersection of Main Street and Uniontown Road on the edge of the Western Maryland College Historic District and the district's namesake, McDaniel College. =Westminster-Mexico= MD 852G begins at an intersection with MD 27 (Manchester Road) just north of the latter highway's crossing of the Maryland Midland Railway. MD 852G heads southeast as a two-lane undivided road to the intersection of MD 852H (Cranberry Road North) and Lucabaugh Mill Road, where the state highway picks up MD 31's old alignment and crosses Cranberry Branch. MD 852G curves to the northeast and passes through a mix of farmland and scattered residences. In the village of Mexico, the state highway intersects MD 482 (Hampstead Mexico Road) and that highway's old alignment, MD 849 (Leisters Church Road). North of Mexico, MD 852G veers north and reaches its northern terminus at MD 27 (Manchester Road). History MD 31 from New Windsor to Westminster was originally constructed as a wide concrete road between 1919 and 1921. The state highway was widened to with a pair of wide macadam shoulders between 1936 and 1939. MD 852 was assigned to its present course after MD 31's present alignment was constructed between 1963 and 1965. MD 852K was assigned to its present course after MD 31's present alignment from southwest of Westminster to MD 140 was completed in 1967. By 1978, the state highway was municipally- maintained on its present stretch, which was named Doyle Avenue. MD 27 from Westminster to Manchester was originally part of MD 31; Manchester Road became a northern extension of MD 27 in 1967. The Westminster-Manchester road was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway was completed from the Westminster city limit north to Cranberry Station on the Western Maryland Railway (now Maryland Midland Railway) in 1911. The road was extended to just south of Mexico in 1913; in addition, construction on the state road began from the Manchester end. The gap between Mexico and south of Manchester was filled in 1914. Construction began on reconstructing and widening MD 31 from Manchester to Westminster in 1957. This project involved several relocations of the highway by the time it was completed in 1960; sections of old road became segments of MD 852, including MD 852G between Westminster and Mexico. Junction lists The entire route of all sections of MD 852 is in Carroll County. =MD 852= =MD 852K= =MD 852G= Auxiliary routes There are eight existing sections of MD 852 that are shorter than . MD 852M is located in New Windsor. MD 852H and 852I are on the north side of Westminster. MD 852A, 852B, 852C, 852F, and 852J are between Mexico and Manchester. *MD 852A is the designation for an unnamed spur of old alignment that parallels the southbound side of MD 27 between a county-maintained section of Old Manchester Road and Snydersburg Road, just south of MD 852B. *MD 852B is the designation for an unnamed section of old alignment between two dead ends just north of MD 852A. MD 852B is connected to MD 27 by MD 27B. *MD 852C is the designation for Manchester Road, a section of old alignment from MD 27 north to a dead end adjacent to MD 27's intersection with Westminster Street just south of Manchester. Westminster Street is the old alignment of MD 31 north to MD 30 in the center of Manchester. MD 852C is the only signed section of MD 852. The state highway runs parallel to the northbound direction of MD 27 and is connected to that highway by a trio of unnamed connector roads: MD 27C, MD 27D, and MD 27E. *MD 852F is the designation for an unnamed section of old alignment between two dead ends just north of the northern terminus of MD 852G. MD 852F is connected to MD 27 by MD 27A (Random Ridge Road). *MD 852H is the designation for a section of MD 31's old alignment from a dead end on the east side of MD 27's crossing of the Maryland Midland Railway to MD 852G's (Old Manchester Road) intersection with Lucabaugh Mill Road. MD 852H is unnamed from the dead end to county-maintained Cranberry Road North, then takes the latter name as it crosses the railroad track to its junction with MD 852G. *MD 852I is the designation for a section of the unnamed spur of old alignment from Hahn Road east to a dead end on the west side of MD 27's crossing of the railroad. *MD 852J is the designation for Martin Drive, a service road that extends from MD 27 south of its intersection with MD 482 north along the southbound side of MD 27 to a dead end. *MD 852M is the designation for Old New Windsor Road, a section of old alignment of MD 31 in New Windsor.

It was created as the Kansas Natural History Society at a meeting at Lincoln College (now Washburn University) in Topeka. The first president was Benjamin Franklin Mudge, the former State Geologist and a professor at the Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University). In 1870 John Fraser replaced Mudge as president, and suggested that the Society broaden its scope to include all science, and not just natural science. The next year, the Society changed its name to the \\"Kansas Academy of Science\\". In 1873 the Society was incorporated by the legislature as a state institution. The legislature placed the Academy under the state department of agriculture and charged them with the creation of a science library and the collection of scientific specimens. Library The library of the Academy was kept in the Capitol Building until 1915 when it was moved along with the library of the Kansas Historical Society into the new Memorial Building with the collections to be managed together. At that time it numbered over 6,000 volumes, most of which were bound journals. That management regime ended up less than satisfactory, and in 1922 the legislature ordered the Academy's library to be moved from Topeka to the University of Kansas at Lawrence. In Lawrence the volumes were eventually moved into the Watson Library, although they were kept as a separate collection. At this point, the Adademy had, for several years, lacked funds to bind their journals, and the collection was not being kept up. So, in 1930, it was sold for $5,000 to various colleges and universities in Kansas. Museum Members of the society assiduously collected geological and biological specimens, and the collections were stored in the offices of the State Board of Agriculture. Then they were moved to the basement of the Capitol Building, and about 1912 the museum was moved to the fourth floor of the Capitol. In 1915 it was moved to the Memorial Building; however, the job was done so incompetently that much of its value was destroyed. Over the next couple of years the remaining specimens were dispersed, and the museum ceased to exist. About 1920 the remaining display cases were sent to the Kansas University art department. Efforts to reestablish the museum were unsuccessful. Notes Sources * Blackmar, Frank W.

At Seville 2002 with Larsen in the bow, Victoria Roberts at stroke and Rebecca Sattin & Jodi Winter in the engine room, the Australian girls won their heat and beat Canada in the final to claim another World Championship title ‚Äì Larsen's second. Larsen was again in elite Australian crew contention in 2003. She raced in a coxless four and the eight at the World Rowing Cup III in Lucerne and secured her place in the eight for the 2003 World Rowing Championships in Milan. With Larsen in the two seat the eight placed fourth. It was her last Australian representative appearance.

Ipanema is a neighbourhood (bairro) in the city of Porto Alegre, the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. It was created by Law 2022 from December 7, 1959. Located on the bank of Gua√≠ba Lake, Ipanema is considered part of the South Zone (Zona Sul) in the city. History In the early 20th century, the beach of Ipanema was still uninhabited, being more a rural area of Porto Alegre. The first dweller of Ipanema was Oswaldo Coufal, who acquired a big property in order to divide it into land lots. Coufal and his family loved Rio de Janeiro, where they used to spend theirs holidays. For this reason the neighbourhood was named after Ipanema in Rio de Janeiro, whose beach is famous worldwide. Despite the mutual names, these two places are quite different from each other: the one from Rio is home to luxury apartment blocks overlooking the sea and the one from Porto Alegre, to middle class houses and some few upper middle class and upper class houses near Gua√≠ba Lake. The streets in Ipanema were named after Rio Grande do Sul coast beaches, like Atl√¢ntida, Cassino, Cap√£o da Canoa, Cidreira, Torres and Tramanda√≠. In 1937, the Santu√°rio de Nossa Senhora Aparecida, designed in a Spanish Colonial architecture style, was inaugurated in Ipanema. However, roots of Eucalyptus trees planted nearby the church broke its walls, and the building was condemned by the prefecture. In 1960, the first modern church in Porto Alegre was built in its place. Also, there is located a private school of the city, the Marista Ipanema school.

It is classified amongst benign idiopathic childhood focal epilepsies such as rolandic epilepsy and Panayiotopoulos syndrome.  Presentation Seizures are purely occipital and primarily manifest with elementary visual hallucinations, blindness or both.Gastaut H, Zifkin BG. Benign epilepsy of childhood with occipital spike and wave complexes. In: Andermann F, Lugaresi E, editors. Migraine and epilepsy. Boston: Butterworths; 1987. 47-81. They are usually frequent and diurnal, develop rapidly within seconds and are brief, lasting from a few seconds to 1‚Äì3 min, and, rarely, longer. Elementary visual hallucinations are the most common and characteristic ictal symptoms, and are most likely to be the first and often the only clinical manifestation. They consist mainly of small multicoloured circular patterns that often appear in the periphery of a visual field, becoming larger and multiplying during the course of the seizure, frequently moving horizontally towards the other side. Other occipital symptoms, such as sensory illusions of ocular movements and ocular pain, tonic deviation of the eyes, eyelid fluttering or repetitive eye closures, may occur at the onset of the seizures or appear after the elementary visual hallucinations. Deviation of the eyes, often associated with ipsilateral turning of the head, is the most common (in about 70% of cases) nonvisual ictal symptom. It is often associated with ipsilateral turning of the head and usually starts after visual hallucinations, although it may also occur while the hallucinations still persist. It may be mild, but more often it is severe and progresses to hemiconvulsions and secondarily generalised tonic clonic seizures (GTCS). Some children may have seizures of eye deviation from the start without visual hallucinations. Forced eyelid closure and eyelid blinking occur in about 10% of patients, usually at a stage at which consciousness is impaired. They signal an impending secondarily GTCS. Ictal blindness, appearing from the start or, less commonly, after other manifestations of occipital seizures, usually lasts for 3‚Äì5 min. It can occur alone and be the only ictal event in patients who could, at other times, have visual hallucinations without blindness. Complex visual hallucinations, visual illusions and other symptoms resulting from more anterior ictal spreading rarely occur from the start. They may terminate in hemiconvulsions or generalised convulsions. Ictal headache, or mainly orbital pain, may occur and often precedes visual or other ictal occipital symptoms in a small number of patients. Consciousness is not impaired during the visual symptoms (simple focal seizures), but may be disturbed or lost in the course of the seizure, usually before eye deviation or convulsions. Occipital seizures of ICOE-G may rarely progress to extra- occipital manifestations, such as hemiparaesthesia. Spread to produce symptoms of temporal lobe involvement is exceptional and may indicate a symptomatic cause. Post-ictal headache, mainly diffuse, but also severe, unilateral and pulsating, or indistinguishable from migraine headache, occurs in half the patients, in 10% of whom it may be associated with nausea and vomiting. Circadian distribution: Visual seizures are predominantly diurnal and can occur at any time of the day. Longer seizures, with or without hemi or generalised convulsions, tend to occur either during sleep, causing the patient to wake up, or after awakening. Thus, some children may have numerous diurnal visual seizures and only a few seizures that are exclusively nocturnal or occur on awakening. Frequency of seizures: If untreated, patients experience frequent and brief visual seizures (often several every day or weekly). However, propagation to other seizure manifestations, such as focal or generalised convulsions, is much less frequent.  Cause  There may be an increased family history of epilepsies (37% of cases) or migraine (16% of cases) but a family history of similar seizures is exceptional.  Pathophysiology  The seizures are of a purely occipital lobe origin. The mechanisms for postictal headache, which is a common event after minor idiopathic or symptomatic visual seizures, with or without a predisposition to migraine, are unknown. It is likely that the occipital seizure discharge triggers a genuine migraine headache through trigeminovascular or brainstem mechanisms.  Diagnosis = Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging = By definition of an idiopathic epilepsy, all tests other than the EEG are normal. However, high resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging is probably mandatory because of the high incidence of symptomatic occipital epilepsies with the same clinico-EEG manifestations. = Electroencephalography = The inter-ictal EEG shows occipital paroxysms, often demonstrating fixation-off sensitivity. However, some patients may only have random occipital spikes, whereas others may have occipital spikes only in the sleep EEG, and a few may have a consistently normal EEG. Photoparoxysmal abnormalities occur in patients whose seizures are triggered by lights.Parmeggiani L, Guerrini R. Idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy. In: Panayiotopoulos CP, editor. Atlas of epilepsies. London: Springer; 2010. 1077-1080. Ictal EEG, preceded by regression of occipital paroxysms, is characterised by the sudden appearance of an occipital discharge that consists of fast rhythms, fast spikes or both. Ictal EEG during blindness show pseudo-periodic slow waves and spikes, which differ from those seen in ictal visual hallucinations. There are usually no postictal abnormalities. = Differential diagnosis = The differential diagnosis of ICOE-G is mainly from symptomatic occipital epilepsy and migraine where misdiagnosis is high. The differential diagnosis from migraine should be easy because elementary visual hallucinations of occipital seizures develop rapidly within seconds, are brief in duration (2‚Äì3 minutes) are usually colored and circular. These are fundamentally different from the visual aura of migraine which develops slowly in minutes, is longer lasting ‚â•5 minutes and mainly achromatic with linear patterns. Symptomatic occipital epilepsy often imitates ICOE-G; neuroophthalmological examination and brain imaging may be normal. Thus, high resolution MRI is required to detect subtle lesions. The differentiation of ICOE-G from Panayiotopoulos syndrome is straightforward. The seizures of ICOE-G are purely occipital, brief, frequent and diurnal. Conversely seizures in Panayiotopoulos syndrome manifest with autonomic manifestations, they are lengthy and infrequent; visual symptoms are rare and not the sole manifestation of a seizure.  Management  Patients with ICOE-G need prophylactic treatment mainly with carbamazepine or other antiepileptic drugs licensed for focal seizures. A slow reduction in the dose of medication 2 or 3 years after the last visual or other minor or major seizure should be advised, but if visual seizures reappear, treatment should be restored.  Prognosis  The prognosis of ICOE-G is unclear, although available data indicate that remission occurs in 50‚Äì60% of patients within 2‚Äì4 years of onset. Seizures show a dramatically good response to carbamazepine in more than 90% of patients. However, 40‚Äì50% of patients may continue to have visual seizures and infrequent secondarily generalized convulsions, particularly if they have not been appropriately treated with antiepileptic drugs.  Epidemiology  Onset is between 3 and 15 years of age with a mean of around 8. Both sexes are equally affected. The disorder accounts for about 2‚Äì7% of benign childhood focal seizures.

The episode was written by series co-creator Ryan Murphy, directed by Tim Hunter, first aired on May 3, 2011 on Fox in the United States, and it features the return of guest star Kristin Chenoweth. In \\"Rumours\\", the glee club is swept by rumors that strain the friendships and relationships of the members, so director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has them perform songs from Fleetwood Mac's 1977 album Rumours. The episode is a tribute to that album, and all the songs covered in the episode are from it. This generated strong interest in the album: Rumours reentered the Billboard 200 chart at number eleven the week after the show was aired in the US, and the Australian album charts at number two five days after the show was aired in that country. The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the episode had its moments that made lovin' Glee fun\\", but called the Sue Sylvester subplot \\"tired\\". Many critics were impressed with how well the album's music was incorporated into the episode including Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone, who wrote \\"the songs of Rumours fit the New Directions' drama in an organic way.\\" The \\"Fondue for Two\\" segments were a favorite of reviewers, and were developed from an idea by one of the show's fans. The musical performances received mostly praise, especially \\"Never Going Back Again\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\". Five of the six Rumours cover versions debuted on the Billboard Hot 100, and four of these were featured on the subsequent Glee: The Music, Volume 6 soundtrack album. Upon its initial airing, the \\"Rumours\\" episode was viewed by 8.85 million American viewers and garnered a 3.7/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. The total viewership and ratings for this episode was up slightly from the previous episode, \\"Born This Way\\". Plot Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) revives the student newspaper The Muckraker. She wants to publish libel about the McKinley High glee club to cause conflict between the club's members and destroy it from within. Brittany's (Heather Morris) new internet talk show‚Äî\\"Fondue for Two\\"‚Äîgives the newspaper some grist when she seems to out Santana (Naya Rivera) on it. Santana berates Brittany for her ill-chosen words, and Finn (Cory Monteith) nearly comes to blows with Sam (Chord Overstreet) over another item that pairs Sam and Finn's girlfriend Quinn (Dianna Agron). Although Quinn and Sam both deny dating, Finn plans a stakeout with Rachel's help to see if it is true. Their surveillance of a shabby motel instead finds Sam and Kurt (Chris Colfer) leaving a room, after which Sam goes back inside alone. Kristin Chenoweth (pictured) makes her third appearance as April Rhodes April Rhodes (Kristin Chenoweth) visits Will to ask for his help with her new Broadway project: a one-woman show entitled CrossRhodes. He tells her about the current glee club tensions, which she likens to Fleetwood Mac when they made their Rumours album. Will and April sing \\"Dreams\\" to the club, and he assigns them to perform songs from the album, to focus them back on music. Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) confronts Brittany: he becomes upset that Brittany cannot recognize that she is cheating on him with Santana, and calls her stupid. Brittany walks away in tears, stating that he was the only one who never called her that up until then, and he sings \\"Never Going Back Again\\". Santana further opens up to Brittany about her true feelings by singing \\"Songbird\\" to her. She agrees to go on Brittany's online talk show to let Brittany ask her to the prom, but she backs out at the last minute. Brittany later overhears Santana claim in an interview for The Muckraker that she is in love with Dave Karofsky (Max Adler), her running mate for prom king and queen. Most of New Directions, minus Kurt and Sam, meet for coffee and speculate about the absent pair. Quinn maintains that Kurt would never cheat on his boyfriend Blaine (Darren Criss), and states that Sam is not gay. When Finn and Rachel resume their stakeout that night, they see Quinn leaving the same motel room, and Sam giving her a hug before going back inside. The next day, the newspaper has an item about Finn and Rachel, who were spotted on their stakeout. Quinn is furious with Finn, and Finn is already mad about seeing Quinn with Sam. They confront each other, then sing a barbed version of the duet \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" as their glee club assignment. Quinn then gives an ultimatum: if Finn wants their relationship to continue, he cannot sing any more duets with Rachel. Rachel has other ideas, and later sings \\"Go Your Own Way\\" to Finn, who accompanies her on the drums. Some sharp accusations are thrown before Sam bitterly reveals that he was at the motel because his parents are unemployed and his family lives there now that their house has been foreclosed on‚ÄîKurt was bringing Sam some clothes, and Quinn was helping Sam babysit his younger brother and sister. Sam storms out. When the club discovers from Quinn that Sam has pawned his guitar, they buy it back for him and offer their support. Sam brings his siblings to a glee club rehearsal, and everyone sings \\"Don't Stop\\". Production The show's co-creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan had long \\"wanted to do an episode\\" that would be a tribute to a single album rather than to a \\"musical act\\". Glee had covered \\"Landslide\\" by Stevie Nicks several weeks earlier in the episode \\"Sexy\\"; Nicks had visited the set to watch the song being filmed, and stayed for six hours. This relationship helped them obtain the rights to cover the songs on the 1977 Fleetwood Mac studio album from which the episode is named. The idea for Brittany's \\"Fondue for Two\\" segments in the episode came from a Glee fan. Teresa Musumeci went to the 2010 Glee Live! In Concert! show at Radio City Music Hall in New York, and she had a letter delivered to Cory Monteith that mentioned she was writing her own internet program: \\"More like a Youtube show called 'Fondue for Two. According to wsvn.com, \\"Heather Morris who plays Brittany admits the idea came from a letter\\", and the show later sent Musumeci an autographed copy of the script and an autographed cast picture in thanks. Chenoweth's reappearance marks her third time on the series as April. She last appeared in the season one episode \\"Home\\". Murphy explained the reason for her return as the failure of her attempt at an all-white musical production of The Wiz. Other recurring guest stars in the episode include glee club members Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), and Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), school bully Azimio (James Earl), school reporter Jacob Ben Israel (Josh Sussman), and cheerleader Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter). Additional guests include Sam's sister Stacey and brother Stevie, played by Ava Chelsea Ingram and Cody Hamilton respectively, a barista played by Cathy Doe, and a coffee shop patron played by Connie Ventress. All six songs from Rumours covered in the episode were released as singles, available for digital download. Chenoweth and Morrison were featured on \\"Dreams\\", McHale sang \\"Never Going Back Again\\", Rivera covered \\"Songbird\\", Monteith and Agron duetted on \\"I Don't Want to Know\\", Michele sang \\"Go Your Own Way\\", and the glee club combined on \\"Don't Stop\\". The episode also included a portion of an original song, \\"Nice to Meet You, Have I Slept with You?\\"‚Äîwritten by Brennan and Adam Anders and sung by Chenoweth and Morrison‚Äîwhich was not released. \\"The Chain\\", also from Rumours, was used as backing music in the second motel stakeout scene. Reception =Ratings= \\"Rumours\\" was first broadcast on May 3, 2011 in the United States on Fox. It garnered a 3.7/11 Nielsen rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and received 8.85 million American viewers during its initial airing. It was the third most-watched scripted show of the week among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The total viewership and ratings for this episode were slightly up from those of the previous episode, \\"Born This Way\\", which was watched by 8.62 million American viewers and acquired a 3.4/11 rating/share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic upon first airing. The episode's Canadian broadcast, also on May 3, 2011, drew 1.49 million viewers and was the eighteenth most-watched program of the week. It dropped three places from the previous episode, which attained 82,000 more viewers. In Australia, \\"Rumours\\" was watched by 959,000 viewers, which made Glee the twelfth most-watched show of the night. The episode was the thirty-second most-watched program of the week, but ranked fifth in the 16‚Äì39 demographic. Viewership again increased from \\"Born This Way\\", which drew 805,000 viewers and ranked fourteenth on the night of broadcast. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.50 million viewers‚Äî2.07 million on E4, and 432,000 on E4+1. It was the most-watched show on E4 and E4+1 for the week, and the second most-watched on cable. Here, viewership registered a slight decline on the previous episode, which attained 20,000 more viewers and ranked first on cable. =Critical response= \\"Rumours\\" was met with mixed to favorable reviews from the critics, though many of the latter listed significant caveats. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"the episode had its moments that made lovin' Glee fun\\". MTV Aly Semigran said \\"It wasn't a perfect episode, but it was certainly an improvement over the last few\\". Lisa Respers France of CNN \\"had a whole ball of tissue\\" in her hand by the time the cast sang the \\"Don't Stop\\" finale, and concluded, \\"Well played, Glee.\\" Brittany's (Morris, pictured) \\"Fondue for Two\\" segment was deemed an episode highlight Time James Poniewozik said \\"while 'Rumours' had its flaws ... the structure allowed the show to serve the stories, rather than feeling like the stories were there to service the songs\\", and particularly praised how \\"the songs were integrated into the drama\\". Semigran and Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone concurred with the latter point, and Futterman wrote that \\"despite a forced theme premise, the songs of Rumours fit the New Directions' drama in an organic way.\\" The Atlantic Kevin Fallon called the episode's focus on the Fleetwood Mac songs \\"a refreshing change of pace\\". Robert Canning of IGN liked the album concept, but felt it \\"didn't fully deliver\\". He gave \\"Rumours\\" a \\"good\\" rating of 7 out of 10, and wrote, \\"What made the episode at least mildly entertaining were the comedy bits. Brittany's 'Fondue For Two' segments were fantastic\\". Most other reviewers were similarly smitten with the \\"Fondue for Two\\" segments, including the aforementioned Reiter, Poniewozik, Semigran, and Respers France. Futterman praised the return of Chenoweth's character April Rhodes, and The Wall Street Journal Raymund Flandez said that she \\"brings such lightness, humor and zaniness that's endearingly button-nose cute\\". Fallon wrote, \\"Chenoweth's every sly smirk, eyebrow tick, and note sung‚Äîwell, that was my week's highlight.\\" Reiter was unenthusiastic: she acknowledged \\"Chenoweth's amazing pipes\\", but added \\"her character, which was thin to start with, has kind of worn out its welcome\\". The subplot of Will thinking about going to Broadway with April was roundly criticized: both Meghan Brown of The Atlantic and Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle said there was no tension at all because the viewer knows that he will stay. The A.V. Club Zack Handlen called the entire scenario \\"ludicrous\\", made even more so by the highly compressed time frame, and their dress rehearsal \\"bizarre\\", criticisms echoed by Brown. Sue's scenes were generally not well-liked. Although Canning wrote that the newspaper \\"delivered on the laughs\\", Entertainment Weekly Sandra Gonzalez characterized the newspaper subplot was \\"neither important nor substantive\\" and was unimpressed with the \\"random, frightening costume changes\\", and Reiter said Sue's storyline was one that \\"felt as tired as secondhand news\\". Poniewozik said that the episode \\"recognized that she is not really a character but a human obstacle\\", which he suggested was \\"a better way for the show to use her\\". According to Hankinson, \\"One of the best parts of the episode centered around Brittany and Santana, but I think all the principals‚ÄîArtie, Finn, Rachel, and Quinn too‚Äîdid a great job portraying the tension and distrust pervading the team.\\" Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times felt the show was \\"absurdly preachy\\" on the matter of rumors, though he said the episode was \\"decent\\". The scene in the motel room with Sam, Rachel, Finn and Sam's brother and sister was called \\"arguably the most affecting scene of the entire episode\\" by Handlen, and Poniewozik wrote that \\"Chord Overstreet sold Sam's feeling of loss\\". Canning felt otherwise: \\"It may have had a better impact if we cared more about Sam or if Chord Overstreet had delivered more believable tears, but as things were, it was just some ordinary, blah drama.\\" The developments in the relationship between Brittany and Santana received considerable attention. John Kubicek of BuddyTV thought the plot was pointless, and said it \\"boiled down to: I'm not ready to come out. I'm ready. Now I'm not again.\\" He added, \\"If you're going to have Santana question herself, at least show it and don't have it all happen off screen.\\" Both Hankinson and Respers France were impressed by the acting of both Morris and Rivera. Hankinson wrote, \\"It feels like their relationship is developing organically\\", while Respers France commended Morris for Brittany's breakup scene with Artie, and Rivera for far surpassing her expectations. =Music and performances= Reviewers hailed Artie's (McHale, pictured) performance of \\"Never Going Back Again\\" All of the musical numbers were generally praised, though not every number was received with the same enthusiasm. Benigno was disappointed that there was \\"nothing special\\" in any of the arrangements, but Futterman saw the performances from a different perspective: \\"They're not as visually stunning, but they're vocally some of the more impressive renditions Glee has done all season.\\" She said of the \\"Dreams\\" rendition by Chenoweth with Morrison, \\"The harmonies and bare-bones arrangement make for one of Glee most faithful covers yet.\\" Most critics welcomed the Chenoweth version. Gonzalez gave the song a \\"B+\\" and Brett Berk of Vanity Fair awarded it four stars of five; both praised Chenoweth but criticized Morrison. Semigran and Kubicek simply gave kudos to Chenoweth alone. Benigno wondered why the pair were trying to imitate Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham when he felt they were better singers than those two, and gave the song a \\"B\\". Hankinson wrote, \\"I enjoyed all the smaller numbers tonight because I felt like the kids really sold the performances and infused some nice emotional context.\\" Of these, \\"Never Going Back Again\\" received the most consistent approval. Futterman said it was \\"better than Artie's post-Tina 'Stronger, and Kubicek declared it \\"proof that he's quite good at hitting emotional notes\\", while Semigran said she was \\"blown away\\". Both Gonzalez and Benigno gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", while Berk gave it all five stars. Berk also gave five stars to \\"Songbird\\", which Gonzalez again gave an \\"A‚àí\\", while Benigno was slightly less generous with a \\"B+\\". Futterman described Santana's vocals as \\"raw and restrained\\", and called her rendition of the song a \\"heartbreaking performance\\", but while Semigran called it \\"sweet enough\\", she also wrote \\"Rivera's voice doesn't pack quite the punch the tune requires\\". Kubicek, however, said it was \\"easily the best song from the episode\\". Many reviewers appreciated the pointed \\"I Don't Want to Know\\" performance. Kubicek called it \\"quite entertaining\\", Gonzalez felt the \\"angry singing\\" was \\"hot\\" and gave it an \\"A‚àí\\", the same grade as Benigno, who said the song had \\"a bit more oomph than the original\\", though he added that Finn \\"sings with the subtlety of an artillery barrage\\" and he was happy with Quinn's \\"strong foundation in the back\\". Futterman wrote that it was \\"better than Quinn and Sam's 'Lucky, but Berk gave the song only two stars out of five, the same grade he gave to \\"Go Your Own Way\\". Although both Kubicek and Gonzalez criticized Rachel's motivations in singing the song, the latter still gave it an \\"A\\" and noted \\"if I had to listen to someone cover this song, it'd be her\\". Semigran called it \\"one of Lea Michele's strongest outings all season\\", while Benigno said \\"this is one of those rare times her balls-to-the-walls delivery works with the arrangement instead of distracting from it\\" and gave it an \\"A\\". Hankinson was \\"particularly fond\\" of the song, and added that it had \\"great energy\\". The group finale of \\"Don't Stop\\" received good grades‚Äî\\"A\\" from Gonzales and \\"B+\\" from Benigno, and four of five stars from Berk. Kubicek found a bright spot in that Sam got to sing a solo. The performance received encomiums such as \\"pretty great\\" from Semigran and \\"inspired\\" from Futterman. The portion of an original song for the April Rhodes musical sung by April and Will, \\"Nice to Meet You, Have I Slept with You?\\", received little commentary, though Flandez made specific mention of \\"her operatic range, and their charismatic stage presence\\". =Chart history= Five of the six Rumours cover versions debuted on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"Go Your Own Way\\" debuted at number forty-five, \\"Songbird\\" at number sixty-eight, \\"Don't Stop\\" at number seventy-nine, \\"Never Going Back Again\\" at number eighty-one, and \\"Dreams\\" at number ninety-two.Peak chart positions for season 2 singles in the United States: \\"Go Your Own Way\\", \\"Songbird\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Never Going Back Again\\", and \\"Dreams\\" The sixth, \\"I Don't Want to Know\\", did not chart. The first four Glee songs on the Hot 100 also charted on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100: \\"Go Your Own Way\\" debuted at number thirty-one, \\"Don't Stop\\" at number sixty-five, \\"Songbird\\" at number seventy, and \\"Never Going Back Again\\" at number eighty. The peak positions attained by \\"Songbird\\" and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" were fifty-four and thirty, in the UK and Australia respectively. Out of the six songs from Rumours that were featured in the episode, four were also featured on the eighth soundtrack album of the series, Glee: The Music, Volume 6: \\"Songbird\\", \\"Don't Stop\\", \\"Go Your Own Way\\", and \\"Dreams\\". The episode also sparked renewed interest in Fleetwood Mac and its most commercially successful album, and Rumours reentered the Billboard 200 chart at number twelve, the same week that Nicks' new solo album In Your Dreams debuted at number six. The two recordings sold a little less than 30,000 and 52,000 units, respectively. Music downloads accounted for ninety-one percent of the Rumours sales. The spike in sales for Rumours represented an uptick of 1,951%, and it had the highest US chart entry by a previously issued album since The Rolling Stones' reissue of Exile on Main St. entered the chart at number two on June 5, 2010. In Australia, the interest had an even more profound effect: five days after the episode aired, the Rumours album entered the Australian charts at number two, and was at number three the following week.

The Scene display of \\"Picokijada - Legenda o picokima\\". \\"Picokijada - Legenda o picokima\\". Legenda o picokima is set in the time of the attack of the Turkish army on the Old town ƒêurƒëevac. As Ulama-beg encountered unexpected resistance and failed to defeat the defenders of ƒêurƒëevac with an army, he decided on a long siege with the goal of starving the army and the people that hid inside. The Legend says that in the surrounded fortress the food had vanished. All that was left was one small rooster (picok ). This could not feed the people, so an old woman suggested to the captain of the town that the rooster should be put in a cannon and shot into the Turkish Camp. Thinking that there was plenty of food in the fortress, Ulama-beg ended the siege and left the battlefield. As a curse, Ulama-beg calls the people of ƒêurƒëevac Picoki , or \\"roosters\\".

The group was founded in 2010 by Abu Assadullah. Professional boxer Anthony Small and Islam4UK spokesman Anjem Choudary are associated with the group. Muslims Against Crusades maintain that Muslims are not \\"obliged to obey the law of the land in whatever country they reside\\". In 2011 the group proposed that Muslims should set up independent emirates in select cities in the UK, operating under sharia (Islamic law) entirely outside British law. The group suggested the towns of Bradford, Dewsbury, and Tower Hamlets in the East End of London as the possible first test beds for these entities. The group has often clashed with the English Defence League. Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group from midnight on 11 November 2011, making membership or support of the group a criminal offence. The group has been denounced by the Muslim Council of Britain, who described MAC as \\"a tiny, and utterly deplorable, extremist group\\". Many former MAC activists are currently active in Islamist groups known as 'Millatu Ibrahim' and the 'Tawheed Movement.'  Rallies  MAC is responsible for a number of incidents including protests outside the Royal Albert Hall and in Kensington on 11 November 2010, when two large plastic poppies were burned during the Remembrance Day silence. A 2010 Remembrance Day ceremony in London was disrupted by members of the organization, who were protesting against British Army actions in Afghanistan and Iraq.

The same group planned to hold another protest in 2011 named Hell for Heroes, declaring that soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan deserve to go to hell. Daily Mirror The group was banned by the Home Secretary the day before the planned protest. Throughout 2010 and 2011 there were various protests against the imprisonment of Muslims, with calls for their release; and calls for a withdrawal of non-Muslim forces from Muslim countries. There was a protest against pastor Terry Jones when he burnt a Quran (the holy book of Islam) in Florida, US on 20 March 2011. They applied to the police to stage a demonstration in London to disrupt the royal wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011, but this was not allowed. On 2 May 2011, Osama Bin Laden, who had led the Islamist al-Qaeda organization responsible for violent attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001, was killed in Pakistan by US forces. On 7 May, hundreds of UK Muslims and MAC members held a rally and Salat al-Janazah (funeral prayer) for him outside the US embassy in London. When protesters tried to storm the embassy, there were clashes with police. On 30 July, around 50 members of MAC and Waltham Forest Muslims marched for two hours from Leyton tube station to Walthamstow town square, calling for democracy to be replaced by sharia law and chanted slogans such as 'democracy‚Äîhypocrisy', 'Sharia for UK' and 'Secularism go to hell'.WALTHAM FOREST: Extremists march through borough, Guardian Series, 30 July 2011 In August, members of Muslims Against Crusades held a demonstration denouncing the Shia denomination and \\"anti-Islamic\\" Shia regimes of Syria and Iran. To mark the tenth anniversary of the 11 September attacks, around 100 men linked to the group protested outside the US Embassy in London, burning US flags and chanting through megaphones. The protest could be heard by mourners in the September 11th Memorial Garden nearby, where a minute's silence was being observed to mark the first airplane hitting the World Trade Center in New York City. On 10 November 2011, British Home Secretary Theresa May banned the group after it planned to repeat the poppy- burning demonstration; membership of Muslims Against Crusades became illegal at midnight. On 2 December 2011, twenty people were arrested on suspicion of being members of a banned group, and two for obstruction and violent disorder at a demonstration outside the US Embassy in London; the police did not confirm a report that the protesters were members of MAC.

The group researches how real-world norms interact with laws concerning file-sharing. The group is currently led by head researcher M√•ns Svensson. The group is exploring the rift between traditional society‚Äôs rules and the social norms that are generated from today's internet culture. The group also maintains the blog Cybernormer, launched in March 2009, to create a venue for knowledge and discussion on how the Internet creates new societal norms. Also discussed are norms in the shape of legislation aiming at regulation of and controlling activities on the internet. The blog covers the groups' research within this field and occasional guests are brought in to write articles. Research =Social Norm Strength= In 2009, the group's first survey findings were published in a paper, Social Norms and Intellectual Property. The researchers came to the conclusion that there are \\"no social norms that hinder illegal file sharing. The surrounding imposes no moral or normative obstruction for the respondents file sharing of copyrighted content.\\" The group conducted a second survey, a comparison to the first survey, and an analysis of the effects of implementation of the IPR enforcement directive in Swedish law, generally called ‚Äùthe IPRED-law‚Äù, under preparation in an article on April 14, 2010. Preliminary results were released on the blog, and statements were made to national press when the IPRED law celebrated its first year in force. Later the results were also published in an article by M√•ns Svensson and Stefan Larsson in the journal New Media & Society. In February 2012, the group conducted a third similar survey as a comparison to the two prior surveys. Partial preliminary results were released in Swedish media and on the project blog. The results mostly concerned the relation between copyright enforcement and online anonymity. =Collaboration with Pirate Bay= On April 18, 2011, the torrent site The Pirate Bay renamed itself to \\"Research Bay,\\" a display of their collaboration with the Cybernorms group. The Pirate Bay encouraged its users to take a sociological survey about file-sharing related issues. Private information was promised not to be released. The survey, powered by Questback queried participants about what media they were most likely to share, and what sources they use to download besides The Pirate Bay. Questions including asking about uploading practices to P2P networks and how much they use free streaming media services to watch TV, films, and listen to music. The survey's stated purpose was to understand online norms and values, which, the website goes on to say, is essential to developing relevant and effective laws and policies. Another purpose of the survey was to help researchers to better understand habits and norms within the file-sharing community. In early May 2012 the Cybernorms Research Group made a second major survey study, using the user base of The Pirate Bay to deepen their understanding of the file-sharing community. Publicity The research group made the news in March 2009 when it found that millions of file-sharers hid their identities online. Its research showed that 10 percent of all Swedes between the ages of 15 and 25 were taking measures to protect themselves against increasing online surveillance. They also made news in their collaborative survey with Pirate Bay. The Pirate Bay had been a partner from the start but that was the first time the site‚Äôs users were being asked to participate. Funding The project received funding from KK-stiftelsen from May 1, 2009, until April 2013. The four-year-project focused on an array of topics including illegal file sharing and its legal analog, to online pictures usage, and gaming for monetary reasons. This last topic focusing on online poker and its normative structures and issues.

Their mission is to assist impoverished children and early education schools in the agricultural regions of Costa Rica. They help by donating school uniforms and supplies such as note books and pencils.Republica United on Facebook, retrieved February 22, 2001. History Republica United was founded by Greg Chapman and his wife Geilyn in January 2010. Greg was born and raised in Caledonia, Michigan, and went to college at Western Michigan University and continued at the Chicago Graduate School of Theology. His first job out of college was in international business. He has been to 14 different countries on 4 continents. Through Greg's international experience, he understood the needs of children who couldn't afford to attend school. With this experience, research, and hard work, he and his wife founded Republica United. Mission Republica United's vision is to eliminate illiteracy and impact the lives of children who do not have the opportunity or financial resources to attend school, and to develop globally aware leaders who have the opportunity to obtain knowledge and access to resources through the use of technology. Republica United provides direct assistance to impoverished children and early education schools in the agricultural regions of Costa Rica through new or improved educational infrastructure, uniforms, and programs resources. To bring that vision into reality, Republica United identifies schools and individuals who are in need of assistance. Through generous support and the work of their volunteers, Republica United assists in the repairs of schools, introduces technology, provides program resources, introduces leadership programs, and provides school supplies and uniforms. Services Republica United is currently working on receiving donations to help schools in Costa Rica, and they look forward to helping Nicaragua and other parts of Central America. Many children in Costa Rica miss out on school because they cannot afford school Uniforms. Republica United uses donations to help local children attend school by providing uniforms for them. They also negotiate with local companies in Costa Rica to produce the school uniforms rather than using expensive shipping methods to transfer them. The local schools inform the organization on what children are in need of school uniforms. Money not spent on school uniforms is put toward school furnishing, repairs and new supplies for students. The government of Costa Rica does not help pay for school supplies for the children, so many students do not have all the resources to get the most out of their education. Many of the schools are not in the best condition, so money is also spent to help make repairs to help make the schools a better place to learn. Republica United is also looking to help with computer labs. This can be very difficult because it is nearly impossible to ship computers over to Costa Rica because of legal regulations. Republica United is looking to make a difference wherever they can by providing students with notebooks, pencils and school uniforms.

Despite having no formal training in aerodynamics, he became one of the world's foremost designers of jet engines. He was involved with the Rolls-Royce company in a variety of roles for almost 30 years. Biography Adrian Lombard was born in the city of Coventry, Warwickshire, on 19 January 1915. He was the second of three sons of Arthur, a toolmaker, and Louisa. Lombard was taught at the John Gulson Central Advanced School, and later attended evening classes at the Coventry Technical College. After leaving school at the age of 15, he began training in the drawing office of the Rover Company. Early career After spending five years with Rover, Lombard took a job with Morris Motors Limited where he was put in charge of engine stress calculations and worked as a motor car engineer. However, he returned to Rover in 1936 and within four years was part of Maurice Wilks' design team. In April 1940 Lombard began his work with jet engines when the team was entrusted with the task of preparing the Whittle W.2B jet engine for production. His designs during this period incorporated a new combustion system and were the precursor to the later successful Rolls-Royce Derwent and Nene engines, which powered most of the first generation of British jet fighters. Rolls-Royce A Gloster Meteor, which was powered by the Derwent engine designed by Lombard. In 1943, Rover and Rolls-Royce completed a deal in which the latter took over interest in the jet engine production factories in Clitheroe and Barnoldswick. Lombard subsequently joined Rolls-Royce and was appointed chief engine designer of factories in the north of England. He assembled a team that built 100 of the W.2B engines for use in Gloster Meteor fighter planes, while simultaneously supervising the design of the Derwent engine. In October 1945, a Meteor equipped with Derwent V engines broke the world speed record at . The design centre was relocated to Derby in 1946, and there Lombard became chief projects designer. His team designed the Avon engine, which powered the Fairey Delta, the first aeroplane to exceed , and other civil jet aircraft including the de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner to make a scheduled transatlantic flight. In 1949, Lombard was promoted to chief designer at the Derby plant, and was made Rolls-Royce's chief aeronautical designer three years later. Lombard was appointed chief engineer at Rolls-Royce in 1954, and around this time he was involved in the production of the world's first 'bypass turbojet' or turbofan engine, the Conway, which was used in the Vickers VC10 and installed in the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 aircraft. He also joined the council of the Royal Aeronautical Society, and was also involved with the Air Registration Board and the Aeronautical Research Council. Lombard became the director of the Rolls-Royce aeronautical engine division in 1958, and was responsible for overseeing the production of all the company's jet turbines. Under his guidance, the company worked on new technology for building jet engines solely from reinforced plastics. This technology was later used in the production of the RB211 engine; its fan blades were originally made from plastic reinforced with carbon fibre. However, during a test in which a chicken was thrown into the engine at high speed, to simulate birds flying into the engine during flight, the composite blades shattered and were subsequently replaced with titanium ones in the final design. In November 1962, Lombard visited Japan to meet with several companies that had expressed an interest in Rolls-Royce's vertical take-off (VTOL) aircraft engines. During the trip, he predicted that such engines would be in general civil use within ten years. Lombard and Stanley Hooker, then technical director of Bristol Siddeley, were jointly awarded the James Clayton award by the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in February 1967, for their pioneering work with vertical take-off engines. Significantly, Lombard predicted the crossover of lift jet technology to the by-pass engine, where the engine carcasses would be integral with the pod structure, thus reducing engine weight. Lombard indicated that the same principle could be applied to a pair of propulsion engines mounted on an underwing pylon. The by- pass duct would be an integral part of the permanent pod structure, into which the engines are assembled.Transatlantic Betrayal. Andrew Porter. Amberley, 2013 In 1966, Adrian Lombard presented the first Royal Society Technology Lecture Aircraft: Power Plants Past, Present and Future. In his presentation, Lombard indicated that the chosen subject was a \\"very topical one both because of the very advanced technology required for the design and manufacture of aero engines and of the interest which has recently centred on the aircraft industry in this country and the controversy on its future\\". Among the controversial issues highlighted by Lombard and centering on the aircraft industry was the Duncan Sandys 1957 Defence White paper. The industry had a number of setbacks, perhaps the most drastic of them was the 1957 Defence White Paper, which erroneously forecast that there would be no new manned aircraft. Following on from the erroneous 1957 White paper and hard on its heels was the Labour government inspired Plowden enquiry that Lombard criticised for causing long term uncertainty for the UK aviation industry. Yet despite the apparent political efforts to stall the British aviation industry, Lombard emphasised that '...the British aero engine industry has retained its technical competitive capability...' and he demonstrated the value of competitive technologies, which led the export of aero engines and returned a major financial contribution to the UK economy: 'The value of engine exports over the last twelve years or so was nearly ¬£650 million excluding engines installed in export aircraft'. Following his death in July 1967, it was written that Rolls-Royce had been \\"deprived of one of the finest trouble- shooting engineers in the industry\\". Lombard's death had unfortunate consequences for Rolls-Royce when it came to the initial design of the early RB211, which suffered performance problems, the cost of solving-which, ultimately were to lead to the company going into receivership in 1971. > \\"It was all too obvious that the Derby engineers, normally proud and self- > confident to the point of arrogance, had slid from bad to worse when their > great leader, Lombard, had been so suddenly plucked from them in 1967, his > death had left a vacuum which nobody could fill ...\\" - Stanley Hooker Lombard's place at Rolls-Royce was eventfully to be filled by former Rolls- Royce and Bristol Siddeley engineer Stanley Hooker, who had by then retired, and under his leadership, assisted by fellow Rolls-Royce ex-retirees Arthur Rubbra and Cyril Lovesey, the RB211 went on to become a most successful design. Personal life Lombard was married to Joan Taylor on 18 April 1940 and the couple had three children, one of whom died in infancy. He was appointed a CBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours in June 1967. Lombard died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage at the Derbyshire Royal Infirmary in Derby on 13 July 1967, at the age of 52. The 'Lombard Award' was established by Rolls- Royce in Sir Adrian's memory, with those in the final year of a company apprenticeship eligible for consideration.. His granddaughter, Fleur, was a firefighter who became the first female firefighter to die in the line of duty in the United Kingdom.

This pair of highways comprise the old alignment of MD 97 between MD 26 near Eldersburg and MD 32 in Fenby in Carroll County. MD 854A and MD 854B, which have lengths of and , respectively, are separated by Morgan Run Natural Environment Area. Route description View south along MD 854B at MD 32 in Fenby MD 854A begins at an intersection with Bushey Road just north of the county highway's intersection with MD 26 (Liberty Road) west of Eldersburg near the junction of MD 26 and MD 97 at Dorsey Crossroads. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road parallel to MD 26, then curves north and parallels MD 97 as the two highways cross Little Morgan Run. North of Bear Branch Road, MD 854A reaches its northern terminus at the entrance to a private driveway just south of the Morgan Run Natural Environment Area property. South of Bear Branch Road, access to MD 97 (New Washington Road) is provided by Bartholow Road, which also leads to the main entrance of the natural environment area east of the state highway. MD 854B begins at county-maintained Muller Road's eastern terminus adjacent to MD 97 just north of the Morgan Run Natural Environment Area property. The state highway heads north as a wide two-lane undivided road that crosses Morgan Run and follows one of the run's tributaries upstream out of Morgan Run's narrow valley. MD 854B widens to in width before intersecting Nicodemus Road, then heads north through farmland on top of a ridge. The state highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 32 (Washington Road) next to Carroll Community College. History The first portion of Old Washington Road to be constructed as a state highway was from MD 32 in Fenby south to Salem Bottom Road in 1935. By 1939, this road, which became one of two disjoint sections of MD 570, was extended south to Nicodemus Road. All of Old Washington Road from MD 32 to MD 26, except the east-west portion parallel to MD 26, became a state highway in 1956 when MD 97 was extended north through Westminster from Howard County. Construction on a new alignment for MD 97 from MD 26 to Westminster, New Washington Road, began in 1957 from the Westminster Bypass south to Fenby; this new highway was completed in 1960. The new alignment of MD 97 was under construction at Morgan Run by 1959 and was completed to MD 26 (now MD 850H) in 1961. MD 854 was assigned to the old alignment of MD 97 except for the abandoned portion of the highway between Muller Road and north of Bear Branch Road. The number was also assigned to the newly constructed east-west portion of MD 854A built east from Bushey Road, which maintained the highway's connection to MD 26 after the original alignment was subsumed by the construction of MD 26's interchange with MD 97 in 1962.

Patrols of around 30 men were ambushed in several places, but the Taliban attackers were driven back. The Marines lost team leader Nicholas Kirven in the meantime. Otherwise, the operation to patrol Laghman Province was a success.  Background  Hours before the Marines were ambushed, they had set out on a rainy morning in a convoy in Laghman Province. It was May 8, 2005, the third day of a week-long patrol called Operation Tar Heels. The platoon of 30 men, commanded by Marine Lieutenant Samuel Monte, had driven as far as it could before the road ended, compelling the Marines to dismount and walk along a valley trail that led to several remote villages. The men had left their bulky flak vests at their patrol base and wore only their SAPI (Small Arms Protective Insert), two-inch- thick bulletproof plates that fit in a vest-so they would have a lighter load when hiking in the mountains. Without full body armor, they could move faster in case of coming into contact with the Taliban, who did not wear any body armor. The goal of the operation was to meet with tribal leaders to find out what help they needed, like medical kits or veterinary visits. The Marines were also hoping to obtain information about the drug lords and militants who were freely operating and living in the area.  Battle of Shatagal  At the third village visited by the Marines, they learned that they were being targeted for an ambush (an interpreter found out over the radio that the Taliban had located \\"thirty Americans. They will not get out alive\\").Zullo, Allan: Battle Heroes: Voices from Afghanistan In a Marine drill called a \\"movement contact\\", the Americans went looking for the militants. Shortly afterward, the Marines, via an interpreter, discovered that they would be ambushed on their way out of the village. Monte had his men stop and form defensive positions in the valley, bordered by two ridges and a river. The Marines then spotted 12 insurgents crossing the river. After being shot at, they (the insurgents), scattered into a large draw (a natural depression into which water drains), before hiding in caves and rock outcroppings. Despite being pummeled by two A10 Warthogs, the insurgents fired from a cave and mortally wounded team leader Nicholas Kirven and Corporal Richard Schoener. Team leader Jason Valencia then cleared out the cave in which Kirven and Schoener's killer was hiding. Another message was decoded by the interpreter, which said that 30 more ambushers were coming. With the use of AC130 gunships, fourteen more charging militants were wiped out. By now, it was nighttime on May 8 and another 15 insurgents were killed. Although what was supposed to be a six-hour patrol turned into a 22-hour firefight, the ambushers were neutralized.  Aftermath  On February 1, 2006, the hard-fighting Lieutenant Stephen Boada was awarded the Silver Star for his bravery in battle. He also received a Purple Heart for being wounded in the battle. So did Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Kirven and Richard \\"Rick\\" Schoener, who died after the battle in the same hospital that treated Boada.

The Fisher River Cree Nation is composed of two reserves; Fisher River 44 and Fisher River 44A. The reserve population is 1945, the off reserve population is 1934 for a total of 3879 band members as of June 2017. Fisher River is 15,614 acres (6,319 hectares). Fisher River is named after the fisher, a North American mammal which belongs to the same family as weasels and skunks. The Chief of Fisher River is David Crate. History =Norway House= The Fisher River Cree Nation were among the hundreds of Cree who began trading at Norway House‚Äîthe administrative centre for Rupert‚Äôs Land‚Äîthe watershed stretching from Hudson Bay to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains and trading hub of Hudson's Bay Company. Furs from Great Slave Lake were traded at Norway House for goods such as metal and cloth from England. By 1875 there were 800 Cree people‚Äîmainly from the Hayes and Nelson River systems‚Äîliving at the Norway House settlement with hundreds employed by the HBC. By the 1870s the natural resources area around Norway House had been depleted and the Hudson's Bay Company scaled back its operations. In 1869 the Government of Canada took over the vast area controlled by the HBC. =From York boats to steamboats= In the 1870s when the Hudson's Bay Company replaced York boats with steamboat transportation on Lake Winnipeg the 200 Cree who operated the York boats in the inland waterways for the HBC lost their jobs. =Rossville mission= In 1840 the Methodists established the Rossville mission‚Äîthe first Methodist mission station West of Lake Superior in British North America‚Äîand by 1875 most Christian Crees lived near the Rossville mission. It was established in 1810 on the eastern channel of the Nelson River just below the northern outlet of Lake Winnipeg.' Six years later, it had grown into a village, consisting of about thirty houses and a church. In the 1870s As the economic situation deteriorated for the Rossville Cree, local missionaries encouraged them to locate further inland on lands more favourable for agriculture and other traditional activities. HBC Chief Factor Roderick Ross reported to James A. Graham that during the 1870s the village of Rossville was in a chronic state of starvation and needed assistance from the HBC Post. This situation was relieved only when its \\"surplus population\\" of 180 Cree moved to Fisher River in 1877 and 1888. The HBC earned $1000 in revenue by assisting with the move. Treaty 5 In 1874, representatives of the Christian Indians of Rossville, led by Chief David Rundle, wrote the federal government requesting support to move to their southernmost hunting region around Grassy Narrows and the present day White Mud River. \\"In 1874, Chief David Rundle and a group of Rossville maskekomowak wrote to Lieutenant-Governor Alexander Morris stating their intention to and requesting assistance to relocate further south to Grassy Narrows/White Mud River region on the western shore of Lake Winnipeg. They had family there already, and the land and fisheries were good.\\" In the summer of 1875 they were denied because the land was being reserved for an Icelandic settlement. The government instead offered them land at the mouth of the Fisher River. Unlike other Treaty No.5 Band who received 160 acres per family, Fisher River only received 100 acres per family.\\" In 1875, the Government of Canada had granted a strip of land along the western shore of Lake Winnipeg between Boundary Creek and White Mud River inclusive of Hecla Island to Icelandic immigrants who established a settlement in what is now Gimli in the fall of 1875. A severe smallpox epidemic erupted in 1876 originating from the second wave of hundreds of Icelandic settlers resulting in hundreds of deaths as it quickly spread to the indigenous First Nation population including the nearby Sandy Bar Band first nation community at Riverton. The newly formed Council of Keewatin imposed severe restrictions on the fur trade with furs and trading posts burnt to prevent the spread of smallpox and no possibility of compensation. The epidemic and quarantine postponed the move until the summer of 1877 when 43 families‚Äîrepresenting 200 people made the 200 mile journey south to the present day Fisher River Reserve. \\"Treaty No.5 was negotiated at Norway House on September 24, 1875 by Chief David Rundle and Councillors James Cochrane, Harry Constatag (Koostatak) and Charles Pisequinip on behalf of the Norway House Band. Charles Pisequinip remained in Norway House when the rest relocated to Fisher River.\\" Then- Lieutenant Governor Alexander Morris represented the Queen in signing Treaty 5 with the Saulteaux and Swampy Cree non-treaty band governments and peoples around Lake Winnipeg in the District of Keewatin. The Christian Indians of Rossville under David Rundle were granted the land on the present reserve at Fisher River. Upon arrival on the reserve lands \\"the people built homes and divided up the land to be used for farming...In addition to farming, the people took part in the seasonal labour provided by the fishing and lumber industries.2 Throughout the 1880s many more families from northern Manitoba joined the original settlers.3 In 1908, the band signed the adhesions to Treaty Number Five which brought more people into the band.\\" Culture Fisher River Cree Nation cultural activities used to include family oriented activities such as dancing, square dances, jigging, fiddling, sports events, and movie nights. =Treaty days= Historically on Treaty days each person would receive five dollars as well as food supplies from the federal government. Families would gather by the Fisher River and camp in large canvas trappers‚Äô tents. Treaty day activities included sports competitions and games, trade booths, and dances. \\"Treaty days were the most anticipated recreational event of the year. When families came together to share and celebrate it created a strong community atmosphere.\\" =Pow Wow= Fisher River holds an annual Ada Wilson \\"Grey Cloud Woman\\" Memorial Pow Wow in August \\"with dancers from across North America in a large arbour beautifully constructed from logs. The pow wow was renamed in 2006 to honour Ada Wilson, a well respected community member.\\" Past Chiefs * David Rundle: Treaty 5 Signatory 1875 * John Cochrane: 1905 ‚Äì 1917 * Joseph Everett: 1917 - 1921 * Moses McKay: 1921 ‚Äì 1922 * Daniel Cochrane: 1922 ‚Äì 1925 * James Murdock: 1926 ‚Äì 1931 * Jeremiah Rundle : 1931 - 1937 * James Murdock : 1938 to 1940 * Alex Hudson: 1940 - 1945 Before the Election of 1945, Previous lists are read to the best understanding * James Murdock: 1945 - 1953 * Charles Sinclair: 1953 - 1959 * Solomon Mallett: 1959 - 1963 * George Sinclair: 1963 - 1965 * Isaac Cochrane: 1965 - 1967 * Solomon Mallett: 1967 - 1969 * Charles Sinclair: 1969 - 1973 * Wesley Hart: 1973 - 1989 * David Crate: 1989 - 1991 * Lorne Cochrane: 1991 - 1995 * David Crate: 1995 - 2001 * Sam Murdock: 2001 - 2003 * David Crate: 2003 - Present Notable people * Verna Kirkness (born 1935 Fisher River Cree Nation, is a Cree scholar, pioneer and lifelong proponent of indigenous language. *Kent Monkman (born 13 November 1965 St Marys, ON, is a member of Fisher River and is visual and performance artist) See also *Fisher River Hawks References External links *Official website *Map of Fisher River 44 at Statcan *Map of Fisher River 44A at Statcan ","title":"Fisher River Cree Nation"},{"id":"31544625","title":"1948 Western Samoan general election"},{"id":"31544628","text":"Julietta is a 1953 French romantic comedy film directed by Marc All√©gret and starring Dany Robin, Jean Marais and Jeanne Moreau.Julietta (1953) at the Films de FranceThissen & Zimmerman p.173 The film was based on a novel of Louise de Vilmorin.

Vadim rewrote the script to the star's satisfaction. The movie was a big success. Vadim and Allegret tried to have Vadim's wife Brigitte Bardot cast as the female lead but the producer went with the better known Dany Robin.

The functional sculpture is located at the Indianapolis Museum of Art's 100 Acres: Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park. Description Based on a section of a topographical map of 100 Acres the artwork consists of emerald green layered platforms that are shaped in a flowing organic manner along the south side of the sculpture parks lake. The artwork consists of fiberglass grids that sit upon a support system made of steel. The support system sits at varied heights. Visitors are welcome to walk on, sit, fish at and explore the structure, which is occasionally non-accessible due to flooding. Information Stratum Pier was created to appear as if it is an extension of the shoreline, exhibiting artist Kendall Buster's desire to merge \\"the natural and the built environment.\\" A visit to the structure allows one to view the cycles of erosion and growth in the 100 Acres environment, cycles that are represented in Stratum Piers layered build. Fiberglass was chosen due to its light weight allowing it to easily sit in its present location and its durability which allows for heavy use by visitors to the park. Buster started to design the piece after a visit to the park and inspiration from the topographical maps created to document the parks environment. Buster expects the work to merge with the landscape as the grass and brush that surrounds the area grows into the work. Buster worked with architect Jeremy Olsen of Wheeler Kearns and project engineer Chris Rockey of Rockey Structures to create the piece. The artwork was commissioned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art and funded by a grant from The Indianapolis Foundation. In June 2010 Indianapolis based Motus Dance Theatre performed one day, every 45 minutes, on Stratum Pier in response to the installation and to celebrate the opening of the park. The artist Before pursuing fine art, Kendall Buster obtained her degree in medical technology, then moved on to earning her BFA at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. After receiving her MFA from Yale University she was involved in the Whitney Museum of American Art's Independent Study Studio Program. Buster's work is described as \\"biological architecture\\" and resides in the collections of the Kreeger Museum, the Kemper Museum, Hirshhorn Museum, among others. She has been commissioned to create public art for the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Markel Corporation, the BOK Center, Nevada Museum of Art, and many others. In 2005 Buster was awarded an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in the Arts. Teaching at Virginia Commonwealth University, she lives and works in Richmond, Virginia.

It happened on December 5, 2001 when a U.S. soldier responsible for calling in airstrikes accidentally misguided the Boeing B-52 bomber to strike a hill held by American Special Forces and dozens of their Afghan allies.  Events  Two days earlier, U.S. Army Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) Jason Amerine and Afghan tribal leader Hamid Karzai fought for the vital Arghandab town of Sayyd Alma Kalay. The Taliban withdrew from the town, and Amerine and Karzai entered the town. After both talked in the headquarters, Amerine left to discuss further airstrikes with another officer. While studying a map, a huge explosion hit the hill near them, apparently from one of their own bombs. Amerine was wounded, while many on the hill were killed or also wounded. A military investigation revealed that one of the men from the headquarters in Sayyd Alma Kalay who arrived earlier in the day made a mistake: he was on the ground calling in airstrikes when he accidentally gave the wrong coordinates for a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress that dropped the 2,000 lb bomb on the hill on which several Americans and Afghans were located.  Deaths and Wounds  Three of Amerine's friends died: *Master Sergeant Jefferson Davis, 39 years old, of Watuga, Tennessee *Sergeant First Class Dan Petithory, 32 years old, of Cheshire, Massachusetts *Staff Sergeant Brian Prosser, 28 years old, of Bakersfield, California 10 Afghans died as well. Forty Afghans and Americans, including Amerine, were wounded. The wounded were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany for treatment.

In 1933, the Capitol was the most luxurious cinema, with full stage facilities and a Compton Organ. The Capitol closed for regular film showings in the 1960s, but it was used also for occasional rock concerts until the late 1990s; it was largely moth-balled since 1998, except for the use of the restaurant as a bar called \\"Oscars\\". The B-listed Art deco interior was extremely well preserved at that point. Permission was granted in 2002‚Äì03 for conversion to nightclubs, which saw the auditorium split horizontally to form two large bar- clubs, and the rear stage wall cut open to create a large glass wall and additional entrances.

Ruvarac introduced the critical methods into Serbian historiography. He was archimandrite of Grgeteg monastery. His three brothers were all distinguished‚Äîthe eldest, Lazar Ruvarac, as a high government official; the second, Kosta Ruvarac (1837‚Äì1864), as a writer and literary critic; and the youngest, Dimitrije Ruvarac, as a historian, Orthodox clergyman, politician and one of the most active publishers of his time.  Biography  Jovan Ruvarac was born at Sremska Mitrovica on 1 September 1832 to Very Reverend Vasilije Ruvarac (1803‚Äì1873) and his wife Julijana, n√©e ≈†eviƒá. He had three brothers, Lazar, Kosta and Dimitrije. His childhood was spent at Stari Slankamen and Stari Banovac in Srem, where he went to grammar school. In 1847 his family moved from Banovac to Karlovci and later to Vienna, where he completed his high school education at the Gymnasium of Karlovci and a gymnasium in Vienna before he enrolled at the University of Vienna's School of Law in 1852. At the same time, he studied history, a passion of his going back to high school days when two of his professors, Jakov Gerƒçiƒá and Aleksandar Stojaƒçkoviƒá, instilled in him a curiosity that remained with him for the rest of his life. In Vienna in the early 1850s he met poet Branko Radiƒçeviƒá, philologist Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, and historian Leopold von Ranke. After graduating with a law degree in 1856, he enrolled at the Theological Seminary of Saint Arsenius (Sveti Arsenije) in Sremski Karlovci, graduating in 1859. Upon completing his studies in law, history, and theology, he decided to take holy orders and the new name of Ilarion on the date of his tonsure at Kru≈°edol monastery on 1 January 1861. Under his new name (Ilarion), he published numerous historical studies that he had written up until then. Ruvarac was devoted to his scholastic work in history, and was hospitable to the many friends and strangers who found their way to Karlovci. He had great admiration for Vuk Karad≈æiƒá and ƒêura Daniƒçiƒá, although their relation were never intimate. He met writer Jovan Subotiƒá (1817‚Äì1886) in 1852 and their mutual admiration and respect for each other lasted until Subotiƒá's death in 1886. He was appointed clerk of the Serbian Orthodox Ecclesiastical Court at Karlovci. In 1872 he became a member of the teaching staff at the Gymnasium of Karlovci, his Alma mater. He was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite at the Monastery of Grgeteg in 1874, and a year later, he was appointed rector of the Theological Seminary of Saint Arsenius in Karlovci. He was prominent in secular as well as religious works, interesting himself in every movement that promoted health, morality, or education, and especially serviceable as friendly, unofficial counsellor of all classes. His theology was that of a liberal high-churchman, and his sympathies were broad. In early 1880 he was commissioned to report on the state of education among Serbs in Austria- Hungary, and his able performance of this task brought him an offer of the bishopric of Karlovci, which he declined. In 1882 he decided to resume his monastic career as archimandrite of the Monastery of Grgeteg. The last years of his life were passed in complete seclusion at the monastery. He died there on the 8th of August 1905. Ruvarac family Ruvarac family settled in Syrmia in Austria-Hungary, today's Serbia, from the region between Bihaƒá and Cazin, nowadays Bosnia and Herzegovina, then Ottoman Empire. His brother, Kosta Ruvarac (1837‚Äì1864), was a writer and literary critic who died while still a student at a university in Pest. Lazar Ruvarac who graduated from the University of Vienna, became a high official in the Serbian Government. His younger brother, Dimitrije Ruvarac, was also a prominent historian and an Orthodox priest, besides being a politician and a publisher. Ilarion Ruvarac, like many of his Serbian peers of his day, spoke several languages, Latin, Greek, German, Hungarian, Rumanian, and Italian. Historiography In 1887 a serious intellectual debate was being waged between adherents of old, traditionalist and romantic schools in Serbian historiography, represented by historians Panta Sreƒákoviƒá and Milo≈° Milojeviƒá, and the advocates of the new, critical and realistic school, headed by Ilarion Ruvarac and Ljubomir Kovaƒçeviƒá. Ruvarac was the first to make a name for himself as a historian who sought justice and truth in every critical work he undertook. He used scientific approaches to refute many deeply rooted and beloved legends, traditions about the treachery of Vuk Brankoviƒá, the eternal freedom of Montenegro, and the death of Tsar Stefan Uro≈° V at the alleged hands of Vuka≈°in Mrnjavƒçeviƒá. Ruvarac was the first to stress the use of primary sources as much as possible in order to obtain evidence of historical truth. He even questioned himself, more often than not, when critically examining historical texts, asking how they were obtained, who had written them and when, and for what purpose. Being pitilessly conscientious and of cynical, sharp wit, Ruvarac exposed many Montenegrin fables that some wished to palm off as historical facts‚Äîeither for personal, political gain, dynastic reasons (Habsburgs, Vatican, Ottomans), or simply to flatter their own vanity. Ruvarac ushered in a revision of all historical inconsistencies written by foreigners or inspired by them concerning Serbs of Montenegro and other regions, destroying one ill-conceived legend after another with no less passion than had those who fabricated them in the first place. Ruvarac, like most intellectuals, knew that so-called events can exert influence even though they never occurred. He also proved that the so-called massacres as described in Njego≈°'s The Mountain Wreath and in the Montenegrin histories of that period, had never taken place. He knew that Njego≈° used poetic license to create a drama in which he could get his ideas across. Ruvarac was right only in that he denounced such speculation as being unauthenticated and therefore unhistorical, as indeed they were. Ruvarac had good reason sometimes to be exasperated by the inaccuracies and fabrications of histories because they were written by foreigners who perpetuated all kinds of stories and myths without researching Venetian archives. It was the Republic of Venice, after all, which had lorded it over the Adriatic coast and fought over it with the Turks for some four centuries (not to mention the French, Austrians, Hungarians, and the intrigue of the Vatican, each with their own political agenda). Most of Ruvarac's career was spent mercilessly struggling with national myth which distorted the historical truth, but there was no turning back after him since he inspired other historians to investigate the past with a critical eye. The tradition of Ruvarac's scholarship and the critical method was carried on by Stojan Novakoviƒá (1842‚Äì1915), Ljubomir Kovaƒçeviƒá (1848‚Äì1918), Mihailo Gavriloviƒá, Stanoje Stanojeviƒá and many others. Jovan Radoniƒá dedicated his first book to Ilarion Ruvarac honoring him for the introduction of the critical approach to Serbian historiography. Legacy He is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.

The film stars Patrick McGoohan as radio talk show host John Kingsley, Margaret Trudeau as his wife Elizabeth, and Kanner with Andrea Marcovicci as terrorists. The story is set within one day during Christmas Eve. The movie was made on a budget of 1.2 million and was filmed in Montreal. Its title is derived from a line in John Donne's poem \\"Death Be Not Proud\\" (Holy Sonnet X): \\"Thou art slave to Fate, Chance, kings, and desperate men.\\" Film director Kanner later took legal action against the film producers of Die Hard in the late 1980s, alleging the producers stole the idea for Die Hard from his film Kings and Desperate Men. Kanner lost his case. Trudeau was the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who was in office at the time of both the film's production and its eventual release. Plot On Christmas Eve, a radio talk show host, his wealthy wife, their mentally challenged son and a federal judge are taken hostage by a group of terrorists.

As Nabokov spent part of his youth at Vyra, he visited his grandmother at Batovo and his uncle at Rozhdestveno. The Batovo mansion burned down in 1925, Vyra was destroyed in 1944, leaving Rozhdestveno as the sole survivor of the triad of estates owned by the Nabokov family. The estate is named after the Rozhdestva Bogoroditsy Church (Church of the Nativity of Our Lady). The mansion designed in the Italian style displays six Ionic columns supporting the main facade. The roof is crowned by a rectangular belvedere. Inside, the large center hall was used for balls and formal receptions. While rooms on the ground floor served for official functions, rooms on the second floor contained the actual living quarters, while the kitchen and other household facilities were located in the basement. Stables and other estate buildings are nearby. During the nineteenth century the estate was acquired by Nabokov's grandfather Ivan Rukavishnikov, and inherited by his son, Vasiliy Ivanovich Rukavishnikov, in 1901. \\"Uncle Ruka\\" died in 1916 and bequeathed the estate along with \\"what would amount nowadays to a couple of million dollars\\" to his nephew Vladimir Nabokov. Nabokov did not enjoy his property for long. In the course of the revolution he left the Leningrad area in 1917 never to see it again. The museum did not start as a memorial to Nabokov, when, in 1957, it began as a venue to show the local history, and was then converted into a museum of a local collective farm named after Lenin. With the presentation of photos from Nabokovs' cook the former estate owners entered the picture. In 1974 the \\"Museum of Local History and Tradition\\" moved to the manor, and ten years later it was transformed into the \\"Rozhdestveno Historic Literary and Memorial Museum of Vladimir Nabokov\\". Nabokov readings started in 1988, and the Nabokov Room was opened in 1992. Significant damage was done by a fire in 1995.

During his playing days, Legg stood , weighing . Legg spent a total of 13 seasons as an active player, all in the Philadelphia organization, later managing the Phillies' Minor League Baseball (MiLB) Double-A farm team, the Reading Phillies, for whom he had previously played. In and , Legg was the hitting coach for the back-to-back South Atlantic League-champion Lakewood BlueClaws. He returned to Reading, as field manager of the Fightin Phils, for the ‚Äì seasons. Legg joined the Lehigh Valley IronPigs‚Äô coaching staff, for the season. Early life and college Greg Legg was born on April 21, 1960 in San Jose, California. He graduated from Duncan High School in Duncan, Oklahoma and matriculated at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in 1978. He played four seasons for the Savages; in all four of his playing years, the team competed in the NAIA Baseball World Series. Legg was a two-time All-American and was named to the all-district team in 1980, 1981, and 1982. During his four-year career at Southeastern, the baseball team accumulated a 209-40 win‚Äìloss record (a .839 winning percentage). After college, Legg was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 22nd round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft. Baseball career =1982-1984= After signing, Legg was assigned to the Peninsula Pilots, the Phillies' A-level affiliate in the Carolina League. Playing alongside future Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame members Darren Daulton and Juan Samuel, Legg appeared in 44 games, making 56 putouts and 130 assists. He committed 15 errors--the lowest total among the team's three regular shortstops--good for a .925 fielding percentage. At the plate, he posted a .343 batting average, notching 9 doubles and 20 runs batted in (RBI). He also stole 2 bases and scored 20 runs during the 1982 season. Legg and Juan Samuel (pictured) were teammates in the minor leagues in 1982 and 1983. Legg, Daulton, and Samuel were all promoted together to the Eastern League Reading Phillies in 1983. Legg posted a .317 average for the season, the second-best mark among the team's regular batters (40 or more games played); he also notched his first professional home runs, hitting four to go with fourteen doubles and one triple. In the field, he appeared in at least one game at all four infield positions, with most coming at shortstop and third base. In 29 games as a shortstop, Legg committed ten errors, but in 41 games at the other three infield spots, he recorded only three fielding mistakes. The Phillies shifted Legg primarily to second base for the 1984 season; he appeared in 57 games at the position for Reading before a promotion to the Portland Beavers. In the first half of the season for the R-Phils, Legg batted .241 in 64 contests, amassing 14 extra-base hits and 27 RBI. After moving to the Oregon club, Legg continued his .241 batting pace in 141 at-bats, collecting eight doubles and one home run. =1985-1987= Playing for Portland in 1985, Legg increased his power, hitting a career-high seven home runs. He added seven triples and eleven doubles to his total for a tally of 25 extra-base hits. His 420 at-bats were third-most on the team, and he played in 115 games, appearing only as a second baseman. In 1986, Legg began the season with the major league club, appearing in three April games. He made his major league debut against the New York Mets, entering in the seventh inning of an April 18 contest as a defensive replacement for second baseman Luis Aguayo. He notched his first two major league at-bats against the Mets on April 20, striking out once. His first hit came on April 27, a pinch-hit against the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 13-5 Phillies loss, after which he was sent back down to Portland. Appearing exclusively at second base, Legg appeared in 120 games in the field for Portland, committing only four errors to notch a .994 fielding percentage. As a hitter, he batted .323, the best mark on the team among those players who exceeded 100 games played. He also led the Beavers with 66 RBI, was fifth-best with six home runs, and tallied 149 hits. He returned to the major league Phillies as a September call-up, appearing in eight major league games after September 1. Legg collected the top performance of his major league career against the Pirates on September 16, hitting safely three times in five at- bats, including a double, scoring one run, and earning his first major-league RBI. He went 1-for-1 against the Chicago Cubs on September 29, and then hit safely twice in two consecutive games against the Montreal Expos on October 4 and 5, raising his season average to .450. Legg spent most of the 1987 season in Triple-A with the Maine Guides, for whom he batted .241 with 16 doubles, 4 triples, 4 home runs, and 30 RBI. He appeared at second base, third base, and shortstop in 1987, mirroring his brief appearance with the major league Phillies. In three contests with the top-level club in 1987, he appeared in one game at each of those three positions, scoring one run in two at-bats over the three games. In the field for Maine, he made a total of 13 errors: 8 at second base, 4 at third base, and 1 at shortstop, regardless of making more appearances at shortstop than at the hot corner. =1988-1990= Legg split time between Reading and Maine in the 1988 season. In Reading, he batted .266 in 84 games. He played 81 games in the field: 80 as a second baseman; and 1 as a shortstop. His ten extra-base hits playing in Pennsylvania included eight doubles, one triple, and one home run, and he batted in 33 runs. As a fielder, he amassed 132 putouts at second base, along with 215 assists against 6 errors; at shortstop, he committed no errors while putting out one and assisting on five outs. After promotion to Maine, where the club was now known as the \\"Maine Phillies\\", Legg batted .242 with a home run and seven doubles under manager George Culver. He split time equally at shortstop and second base for the New England club, collecting a .966 fielding percentage at the former position and a .956 percentage at the latter. For the year, Legg's final average was .258, along with a .308 slugging percentage and a .345 on- base percentage. After the 1988 season, the Phillies' Triple-A franchise moved to the Wyoming Valley in Northeastern Pennsylvania, becoming the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons. Legg batted .248 for the newly minted team, batting in 33 runs on 94 hits, 12 for extra bases. He played primarily third base (40 games) and shortstop (42 games), but made limited appearances at second base as well (21 games), totaling 11 errors as a fielder. Legg also made his first career appearances as a pitcher, totaling two innings pitched. He allowed six runs on eight hits to amass a 27.00 earned run average (ERA) for the 1989 season. Legg continued with the Red Barons in 1990, becoming mostly a third baseman for Scranton. He also appeared at second and first bases, as well as shortstop, but totaled a .974 fielding percentage (2 errors) at the hot corner. He raised his batting average 60 points to .308, amassing 6 extra-base hits and 21 RBI. 31 walks helped to raise his on-base average to .416, and he slugged .355, scoring 25 runs. =1991-1994= For the 1991 Red Barons, Legg was the primary backup to the starting infielders, making the team's second-highest number of appearances at second base, third base, and shortstop. His highest total came at third, where he made 22 putouts, 72 assists, and 4 errors in 45 games, amassing a range factor of 2.09. At second base, he had a perfect 1.000 fielding percentage, with no errors in 38 games. He also made a single pitching appearance, allowing a run on three hits in a single inning of work. He batted .290 for the year, collecting four triples and three home runs, along with 15 home runs and 41 RBI. The following year, Legg split time between second and third bases, making 6 errors in 86 games played in the field. As a hitter, he batted only .228, the lowest single- season total of his career. He hit for extra bases 15 times and batted in 29 runs. Legg bounced back in 1993 at age 33--the oldest Red Baron--raising his average to .280. He notched 13 doubles and 3 triples, batting in 25 runs. He led the team in appearances at second base, making five errors. He also played in a few games at third base and one at shortstop. Having stopped playing to coach for the 1994 season, Legg was activated into the minor league system by the Phillies after an injury to shortstop Kevin Stocker. After batting .298 with four doubles, two home runs, and ten RBI during the 1994 season, Legg retired for good to become a coach. After playing Legg replaced Mike Schmidt (pictured) as the Clearwater Threshers manager in 2005. After leaving the Red Barons, Legg stayed with the Phillies franchise, moving to the Clearwater Phillies as their hitting coach for 1994 and 1995; the team finished with the Florida State League best record in his second year. In 1996, Legg was inducted into the Southeastern Oklahoma State University Athletic Hall of Fame by his alma mater on January 27. He was the hitting coach for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons that season, when the team posted a 70-72 record. In 1997, Legg was given his first managing position, leading the Batavia Clippers to the New York‚ÄìPenn League finals, where they lost to the Pittsfield Mets. He managed the Martinsville Phillies in 1998, and returned to Batavia in 1999, where the newly renamed Muckdogs lost in the semi-finals. He led the Piedmont Boll Weevils to another semi-final defeat in 2000, and was named the Lakewood BlueClaws inaugural manager in 2001. In 2002, the Reading Phillies named Legg their manager, and he accumulated a 76-66 record in his first season. It was his only winning record, however, in three seasons as the team's manager; his 202 wins are the fifth-best total among Reading's managers. For the 2005 season, Legg moved to Clearwater, with the team now known as the \\"Threshers\\", taking over the manager's duties from Mike Schmidt. In two seasons with Clearwater, he improved the team from a .301 winning percentage (41-95) to .482 (67-72), and he proceeded to the Williamsport Crosscutters for the 2007 season. For the 2008 season, Legg returned to Lakewood as the hitting coach, helping the BlueClaws to an 80-60 record. In July 2008, during the Beijing Olympics, Legg served on the staff of the major league club as a short-term replacement as bullpen coach for Roly de Armas, who was on the staff of Team USA. In 2009 and 2010, Legg and the BlueClaws staff led the team to back-to-back South Atlantic League championships. Philanthropy In February 2010, Legg established the Northeast Pennsylvania Diamond Scholarship Award, a $1,000 award presented annually to a high school baseball player from Luzerne or Lackawanna Counties in Pennsylvania. Legg said of the scholarship, \\"There are so many charities that touch all our lives... I wanted to put a face on it, I wanted it to be a baseball scholarship. Down the road we will be looking to add a softball player as well.\\" See also *Philadelphia Phillies all-time roster (L) References External links 1960 births Living people Peninsula Pilots players Reading Phillies managers Reading Phillies players Portland Beavers players Maine Guides players Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons players Philadelphia Phillies players Southeastern Oklahoma State Savage Storm baseball players Baseball players from California Baseball players from Oklahoma Sportspeople from San Jose, California People from Duncan, Oklahoma Minor league baseball managers ","title":"Greg Legg"},{"id":"31545062","text":"Palais Widmann in Bolzano/Bozen, seat of the South Tyrolean government The Government of South Tyrol (; ) is the chief executive body of the autonomous province of South Tyrol in northern Italy enforcing the provincial laws as written by the Landtag legislature.

History During Israel's first two decades, the Israel Police headquarters were in Tel Aviv. As the organization increased its size, the need for a new staff building became apparent. Following the Six-Day War, in which Israel captured all of Jerusalem, a new location was chosen in eastern Jerusalem, between Mount Scopus and the western part of the city. The original building, first planned during the Jordanian period as a hospital, was redesigned by architect Dan Eytan and inaugurated in 1973, at which time a second and larger building was added. The Ministry of Public Security building was later built next to the police headquarters.

It was partially destroyed by fire in World War II, reopened in a limited form until 1953, and was finally demolished in 1976. History Haus Potsdam, 1913 =Haus Potsdam= The six-storey building was designed by Franz Heinrich Schwechten, who was also the architect of the Anhalter Bahnhof and the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, and constructed between 1911 and 1912 as Haus Potsdam. It was primarily an office building; from 1917 or 1919 until 1927 Universum Film AG or UfA, which owned the site, was headquartered there;Hans Borgelt, Die UFA - ein Traum: hundert Jahre deutscher Film: Ereignisse und Erlebnisse, Berlin: Ed. q, 1993, , pp. 70, 127 (1917)Klaus Kreimeier, trans.

The building was faced with sandstone and gave the impression of masonry, but had a steel frame and the cinema space was spanned by five girders.Peer Zietz, Franz Heinrich Schwechten: ein Architekt zwischen Historismus und Moderne, Stuttgart: Menges, 1999, p. 51 At the northern end, facing the square, was a circular pavilion topped by a copper dome rising 35 metres above the pavement, with a row of Attic statues beneath it;Otto Sarrazin and Friedrich Schultze, \\"Der Neubau 'Haus Potsdam' in Berlin\\", Zentralblatt der Bauverwaltung May 18, 1912, pp. 254-57, p. 254 this was essentially a recreation of the mausoleum of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Ravenna. The cafe entrance was on the bottom two floors of this section.Zietz, p. 50. Behind it, a long, narrow section in a simplified Wilhelmine architectural style, with a mansard roof, extended some 100 metres alongside the Potsdamer Bahnhof. The Caf√© Piccadilly could accommodate some 2,500 guests and was lavishly decorated with wall and ceiling paintings and Sienese marble.Photographs Sarrazin and Schultze, p. 259, Plate 16; Green p. 218, Plate 12.

After World War I began in 1914, it was renamed to the more patriotic Caf√© Vaterland.Eberhard Buchner, Kriegsdokumente, Munich: Albert Langen, 1914, p. 241 There is disagreement about the exact new name of the cafe and about when the building was renamed. According to Jeffrey Verhey, The Spirit of 1914: Militarism, Myth and Mobilization in Germany, Cambridge: Cambridge University, 2000, p. 87, Caf√© Piccadilly became Deutsches Caf√© (German Caf√©); according to Werner Hecht, et al., ed., Bertolt Brecht, Werke: grosse kommentierte Berliner und Frankfurter Ausgabe, Volume 1, St√ºcke I, [East] Berlin: Aufbau/Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1989, /9783518400616, p. 561 , it became Deutsches Kaffeehaus 'Vaterland' ('Fatherland' German Coffeehouse); according to Mark R. McGee, Berlin: A Visual and Historical Documentation from 1925 to the Present, Woodstock, New York: Overlook, 2002, , p. 136, it became the Deutsches Cafehaus (German Coffeehouse), and he and Zeitz among others state that the entire building was renamed Haus Vaterland in 1914; H√§nsel and Schmitt, p. 193, also implies this, saying that the cinema became the Kammerlichtspiele im Haus Vaterland in 1914, and Kreimeier, p. 43, refers to it as \\"the Fatherland House (formerly the Piccadilly)\\" in 1919. However, according to Green, the building was Haus Potsdam for 16 years. Also Elfi Pracht, M. Kempinski & Co., Historische Kommission zu Berlin, Berlin: Nicolaische Verlagsbuchhandlung Beuermann, 1994, , p. 72 dates the renaming of the building to 1 February 1928. =Haus Vaterland= Haus Potsdam became less successful during the 1920s, and in 1927 was sold to the Bank f√ºr Handel und Grundbesitz, which leased it for ten years to the Kempinski family of restaurateurs. They had an exclusive contract to provide all food and drink and to manage the business, which became their flagship.Gottfried Korff and Reinhard R√ºrup, Berlin, Berlin: die Ausstellung zur Geschichte der Stadt, Exhibition catalogue, Berlin: Nicolai, 1987, , p. 412 Jochen Kleining, M.

In 1928, the building was reopened as Haus Vaterland, based on an idea by Leo Kronau, who had visited Coney Island in New York and wanted to emulate the international attractions in the amusement parks there and improve on Berlin's own imitation, Lunapark.Green, pp. 212, 216. He persuaded the Kempinski family, who had a 65-year track record of success as restaurateurs in Berlin, to convert Haus Potsdam into a Haus der Nationen (house of nations), and became its first artistic director, arranging entertainment to suit the flavour of each of the gastronomic units.Green, pp. 216, 220. The architect for the conversion, Carl Stahl-Urach, the architect for Fritz Lang's Doctor Mabuse films,McGee, p. 136, describes him as an entrepreneur. modernised the exterior by applying stucco and in particular by wiring the domed section to be illuminated at night as an example of Architecture of the Night (Architektur der Nacht) or Light Architecture (Licht-Architektur) which also emulated Coney Island lighting effects.Green, p. 218. The lettering around the rotunda was illuminated, and approximately 4,000 bulbs arranged in intersecting arcs on the dome turned on and off to create the illusion of spinning motion. A reporter in Germania applauded the \\"Babylonian dome\\" as irrefutable evidence that \\"here, world-capital life is pulsing.\\"Green, p. 218 and note 34, p. 223. David Clay Large describes it as \\"a beacon of commercial kitsch\\". Inside, the cafe was renovated and the building extended and the cinema moved to make room for a new entrance block in the centre of the building; in the rest of the space, restaurants dedicated to different countries and regions of the world were constructed. Each was decorated appropriately with dioramas up to 6 metres deep,Wilhelm Klauser, \\"Vom Pot au Feu zum Processed Food: Das Restaurant als Ort der Moderne\\", Petra Hagen Hodgson and Rolf Toyka, Der Architekt, der Koch und der gute Geschmack / The Architect, the Cook, and Good Taste, Akademie der Architekten- und Stadtplanerkammer Hessen, New York: Birkh√ºser/Basel: Springer, 2007, , pp. 110-19, p. 114 panoramas, and lighting effects, and served appropriate food; it was an early example of modern theme dining or experiential gastronomy.Andreas Muhs and Heinrich Wefing, Der neue Potsdamer Platz: ein Kunstst√ºck Stadt, Berlin: be.bra, 1998, , p. 22 Michael Sontheimer, Berlin Berlin: Der Umzug in die Hauptstadt, Hamburg: Spiegel, 1999, , p. 164 While the main shows took place in the ballroom, each theme restaurant also had musicians of the appropriate origins on staff to complete the dining experience, including at least six dance bands.A 1979 article in Cadmos, referring to it as the peak of the early modern movement to entertain the customer with complete experiences of exotica: p. 85 : \\"Le comble est atteint √† Berlin . . . une sorte d'immense b√¢tisse o√π sont install√©s des restaurants de toutes les cuisines et employ√©s des orchestres de toutes les nationalit√©s.\\"John Chilton, Sidney Bechet: The Wizard of Jazz, London: Macmillan/New York: Oxford University, 1987, , p. 85.Green notes (p. 223, note 40) that Richard Fleischer, the artistic director from 1935 to 1943, told him that the Wild West cowboys were Americans, but most of the other performers were Germans playing parts. Sontheimer also says the \\"gypsy\\" violinists were from Neuk√∂lln (p. 164). A central kitchen occupied the entire top floor, connected to the different dining establishments by pneumatic tubes, through which orders came up, and dumbwaiters, by means of which food was sent down and dirty dishes sent back up; conveyor belts at kitchen level transferred the dishes to be machine washed, dried and stacked. The whole was run on American- influenced principles of industrial efficiency.Green, p. 220. It published a house magazine called Berolina - Latin for Berlin and most famously embodied in the statue in the Alexanderplatz.Chilton, p. 86. It was an enormous and popular establishment,Klauser, p. 114, characterises it as \\"one of the greatest gastronomic sensations of Europe.\\" and like Haus Potsdam before it, is frequently alluded to in both artistic and tourist contexts, for example in Irmgard Keun's 1932 novel Das kunstseidene M√§dchen (The Artificial Silk Girl). Its combination of spectacle, variety performances, international dining and cinema was unique.MatHias Bleckman, Harry Piel: ein Kino-Mythos und seine Zeit, D√ºsseldorf: Filminstitut der Landeshaupstadt D√ºsseldorf, 1992, , p. 194 Large sees it as having been \\"a kind of proto-Disney World\\".David Clay Large, Berlin, New York: Basic Books, 2000, , p. 206. The building could accommodate up to 8,000 people; the 4,454 square metres of theme restaurants had a capacity of 3,500 people and Caf√© Vaterland was the largest in the world; the one millionth guest was recorded in October 1929, barely a year after the opening.Green, pp. 211, 220.Pracht, p. 75. =Third Reich and World War II= In the Nazi years, the mix of restaurants was modified and the Jewish Kempinskis had to sell the building for a pittance to \\"Aryans\\" and leave the country. A 1936 French film, Les Loups entre eux (English title: The Sequel to Second Bureau), features scenes in Haus Vaterland, including \\"the Horst Wessel song booming from the loud-speaker\\".Review by Graham Greene in The Spectator, 19 March 1937, The Graham Greene Film Reader: Reviews, Essays, Interviews & Film Stories, ed.

The business continued to host throngs of customers even after Berlin began to suffer heavy bombing by the Allies. In 1943 the building was damaged, particularly in the central section, in the raid on the night of 22 November that destroyed much of the centre of the city.Volker Wagner, \\"Die Nacht, in der die Uhr stehen blieb\\", Tagesspiegel 22 November 2003 On 2 February 1945 it was bombed out, only the walls left standing. Burnt out ruin of Haus Vaterland after the war, 1947 The Park Kolonnaden on the site of the former Haus Vaterland (2004). The semicircular frontage is paying homage to the vanished building. =Under occupation= After the war, Potsdamer Platz was the point where three of the four Allied occupation zones met. The ruined Haus Vaterland was in the Russian sector, but had doors to both the British and the American. In 1947, Caf√© Vaterland was reopened in an acclaimed gesture of will to rebuild the city, and in 1948 the Communist cabaret Frischer Wind was playing there,\\"Heldentum zu hohen Preisen: am entgleisten Pof\\", Der Spiegel 28 August 1948 while because of its position on the sector lines, it was a hotbed of spying, flight from the East, and black marketing in currency and goods.Heinrich Goertz, \\"Frischer Wind im Haus Vaterland 1948 / Erinnerungen\\", Die Horen: junger Literaturkreis 117-18 (1995) p. 119 =Destruction= The building was finally completely burnt out on 17 June 1953, along with Erich Mendelsohn's Columbushaus, during the East German strike and protest.\\"Briefe kamen nie an\\", Der Spiegel 6 July 1955 It was then left in ruins, the windows simply being walled up. It was adjacent to the Berlin Wall after its construction in 1961. In 1966 Der Spiegel described the desolation of the Potsdamer Platz during those years, with birch trees growing out of the rubble of what had been the busiest traffic intersection in Europe and kestrels nesting in the ruin of Haus Vaterland and hunting rats which emerged from locked S-Bahn entrances.\\"Das Glitzerding\\", Der Spiegel 3 October 1966 In 1972, the Senate of West Berlin bought the building as part of 8.5 hectares of land to build a road,\\"Anordnung der Alliierten Kommandatura vom 21.

The 600 tonnes of iron and steel were sold as scrap. In the mid-1980s artists and members of the alternative culture converted the wasteland, which had been used for dumping and parking, into a caravan colony.Sontheimer, p. 158. Ironically, when Potsdamer Platz was rebuilt after German reunification, the site of Haus Vaterland was the only parcel on which no entertainment facility was sited, only offices, because it was felt to be too small. The new building abutting the square, which is part of the Park Kolonnaden ensemble, was given a semi-circular fa√ßade in homage to the round section of the building which had once stood there.Frank Roost, Branding Center: √úber den Einfluss globaler Markenkonzerne auf die Innenst√§dte, Wiesbaden: VS, 2007, , pp. 148-49 Description Haus Vaterland promised die Welt in einem Haus - \\"the world in one house\\".The souvenir programme for the 1928 opening celebration, on Klaus Lindow's site Green, p. 212. Siegfried Kracauer said, \\"Haus Vaterland includes the entire globe\\".Siegfried Kracauer, Die Angestellten: aus dem neuesten Deutschland, Frankfurt: Societ√§ts-Verlag, 1930, , , quoted in Info Box: The Catalogue, 2nd ed.

He also pointed out the contrast between the \\"exaggerated\\" New Objectivity in the style of the \\"immense\\" lobby and the \\"luxuriant sentimentality\\" of the dining establishments as little as one step away.Kracauer, p. 92. He used this example to argue that the New Objectivity was merely a fa√ßade.Die Angestellten, p. 96, quoted in Sabine Hake, Topographies of Class: Modern Architecture and Mass Society in Weimar Berlin, Ann Arbor, Michigan: University of Michigan, 2008, , p. 163; photograph of the lobby Fig. 4.7, p. 164, from Elisabeth Maria Hajos and Leopold Zahn, Berliner Architektur der Nachkriegszeit, Neue Architektur der Gross-st√§dte, Berlin: Albertus, 1928, . To Franz Hessel, it was a \\"perfectly planned city of entertainment\\" which demonstrated the nascent totalitarianism of \\"monster Germany\\".Franz Hessel, Ein Flaneur in Berlin, p. 57, cited in Anke Gleber, The Art of Taking a Walk: Flanerie, Literature, and Film in Weimar Culture, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University, 1999, , p. 72 and Hake, pp. 53-54. Sydney Clark summed it up in his guide for British tourists as a must-see because it typified Berlin: > I can think of no better way to top off a Berlin night . . . than an hour or > two or three in Haus Vaterland. The place is certainly not \\"high hat,\\" nor > is it low hat, but it is of the very essence of Berlin.Sydney Clark, Germany > on ¬£10, Ten pound series 2, London: Nicholson and Watson, 1934, , p. 190. The original attractions were: =Kammerlichtspiele im Haus Vaterland= The cinema, from about 1920 renamed UFA-Haus am Potsdamer Platz, was moved and enlarged to 1,415 seats in Stahl-Urach's renovation. The auditorium was strikingly modern, on a circular plan and with vibrant red carpeting and gold- painted wooden trim on the seats. It was one of five Berlin cinemas Sydney Clark recommended to the American tourist in 1933 as worth seeing (the others being the Titania-Palast, the UFA-Palast am Zoo, the Primus-Palast and the Phoebus Palast).Sydney Clark, Germany on $50, Fifty dollar series, New York: McBride, 1933, , p. 194. =Ballroom= Variety show in the Palmensaal The ballroom, also called the Palmensaal (palm room) was under the dome, and intended as a re-creation of the Garden of Eden.Green, pp. 212, 218. The Palmensaal had a dance floor mounted on springs to prevent fatigue. It was considered the most beautiful ballroom in Berlin, and attracted up to a million visitors a year. It was decorated with silver palm fronds and sculptures by Josef Thorak, who was to be popular during the Nazi era. Jazzmeister Bill Bartholomew led the house dance band and the \\"Vaterland- Girls\\" performed. =Grinzinger Heuriger= A re-creation of a Viennese Heuriger in Grinzing, on the third floor. The menu included Sachertorte prepared from the authentic recipe; the Kempinskis had an exclusive licence to offer it in Berlin.Green, pp. 218, 220. Guests sampled the new wine looking out at the steeple of St. Stephen's cathedral against a starry sky, and a tram with interior lights lit crossed the bridge over the Danube. In the Berliner Tageblatt, the Austrian writer Arnold H√∂llriegel declared the place to be far more genuine than the real thing.\\"viel echter als selbst in Wien\\": \\"Donnerwetter inbegriffen. Berlin wird so amerikanisch\\", 14 November 1929, cited in Christian J√§ger and Erhard H. Sch√ºtz, St√§dtebilder zwischen Literatur und Journalismus: Wien, Berlin und das Feuilleton der Weimarer Republik, Wiesbaden: Deutscher Universit√§ts-Verlag, 1999, , p. 153 , and elsewhere. =Rheinterrasse= The Rheinterrasse (Rhine terrace) on the third floor in the circular section of the building, had a diorama to give the illusion of sitting outdoors overlooking the river between Sankt Goar and the Lorelei rock. A troupe of twenty \\"Rhine maidens\\" danced between the tables under hoops twined with grape vines. Hourly thunderstorms were created by lighting and sound effects; one American visitor reputedly \\"beam[ed] like a movie theater fa√ßade on Broadway\\" when told about this.Janet Ward, Weimar Surfaces: Urban Visual Culture in 1920s Germany, Weimar and now 27, Berkeley: University of California, 2001, , p. 181. The establishment used the motto: > Haus Vaterland machts gr√ºndlich ‚Äì im Haus Vaterland gewitterts st√ºndlich > (Haus Vaterland does it thoroughly - in Haus Vaterland it storms hourly)Some > sources have Im Haus Vaterland i√üt man gr√ºndlich, hier gewitterts st√ºndlich > - In Haus Vaterland one dines thoroughly, here it storms hourly. =T√ºrkisches Caf√©= The T√ºrkisches Caf√© (Turkish cafe), on the fourth floor, had gilded arches and marble floors. =L√∂wenbr√§u= The L√∂wenbr√§u, across from the T√ºrkisches Caf√© on the fourth floor, emulated a Bavarian bierkeller and looked out on a painted view of the Zugspitze, behind which diners could watch the sun set. An \\"original Bavarian band\\" provided the entertainment. =Puszta Czardas= A Hungarian peasant tavern, on the fifth floor, with gypsy violinists. =Bodega= A Spanish wine cellar, also on the fifth floor, with mandoline players. =Wild West Bar= A frontier saloon in the Rocky Mountains, also on the fifth floor. Dancing was to American jazz, and cowboys in full western get-up, some of them black, twirled their lassos. Beautiful chorus girls also performed there. Sidney Bechet played there in the early 1930s, with \\"The McAllan Blackband\\", which was led by the Somali-German drummer William 'Willi' Mac Allan, and the \\"Tom Bill Nigger Band\\". It was later renamed the Kolonialstube (colonial parlour). There were no British or French rooms because Kempinski was too patriotic to forgive them for the Treaty of Versailles. In 1930, the Bodega was relocated to make room for two more regional German rooms: =Bremer Komb√ºse= The Bremen Galley, named for the ship-board cooking of the North German seaport. =Teltower R√ºbchen= An \\"old Berlin beerhall\\" named for the variety of turnips named for Teltow, near Berlin.Nentwig, p. 178.Peter Lummel, \\"Erlebnisgastronomie um 1900 ‚Äì Das ‚ÄûHaus Vaterland‚Äú in Berlin\\", Herbert May and Andrea Schilz, eds., Gasth√§user: Geschichte und Kultur, Arbeit und Leben auf dem Lande 9, Exhibition catalogue, Museen des Ausstellungsverbundes, Petersberg: Imhof, 2004, 193-206, p. 194 Two small rooms were also added to honour friends of the Third Reich, although before the Tripartite Pact of 1940: =Japanische Teestube= A Japanese teahouse, with \\"original Japanese service\\". =Osteria= An Italian bar, replacing the Hungarian Czardas.

It was officially opened on 15 December 2012.\\"Footbridge opens safe new path for Auckland pedestrians\\", New Zealand Transport Agency. 15 December 2012. Retrieved 8 July 2013. The bridge connects Westhaven Marina, over the widened 10-lane motorway, to the Jacob's Ladder stairs leading up to the Saint Marys Bay suburb. The bridge is 102m long, 3.7m wide, and be 6m above the motorway with an internal height of 3m. The bridge was forecast to cost up to $5 million.Gateway to Auckland - The Aucklander, 12 November 2009, Page 5 The final cost of the bridge was $7.9 million.\\"Bridge completes $340m project\\", Stuff.co.nz. 4 December 2012. Retrieved 8 July 2013. The bridge provides a gateway statement to Auckland for travellers on the motorway, clad in a golden-coloured mesh network reminiscent of Maori fishing nets or fish traps, and it is lit up at night to provide a similar visual effect. Previously, the Jacob's Ladder stairs had come all the way down to the motorway level on the southern side, and then connected on the eastern side via a footpath. The stairs now only extend down as far as the bridge's crossing height, with ramped pedestrian paths running west and east along the motorway's southern side. On the northern side, stairs and an elevator provide access down to the marina car park. Construction was underway for abutments and column footings of the bridge as of early 2011. While Jacob's Ladder access was restored in time for the Rugby World Cup 2011, the new bridge was to be completed some time later. In August 2011, the two trusses had been installed, and the floor slabs for the bridge were beginning to be installed, transport in place by a temporary \\"monorail\\" attached to the top of the truss.  History of the name  The Bridge derives its name from the adjacent staircase, originally a wooden set of stairs dating from the late 19th or early 20th century and now replaced by a newer structure built at the same time as the bridge. The Auckland stairs derive their name, as do other similar stairs around the world, from a Biblical reference. Jacob's Ladder is the colloquial name for a bridge between the earth and heaven that the biblical Patriarch Jacob dreams about during his flight from his brother Esau, as described in the Book of Genesis. \\"And he dreamed, and behold, there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!\\". This name is applied to a number of steep public staircases throughout the world as well as being depicted on a large scale as sculptural elements on the facade of Bath Abbey. The name also has many other uses.

Originally a founding member of the Mission Mountain Wood Band, his songs have also been recorded by artists Michael Martin Murphey and Loretta Lynn among others. He is known as a musical and cultural ambassador for the state of Montana and was appointed to the Montana Arts Council by Governor Brian Schweitzer. He has toured extensively throughout the United States, Canada, and Japan. He was the Democratic nominee for Montana's House seat in the 2017 special election.  Early life  Born January 5, 1948 in Cut Bank, Montana, Quist began singing at a young age and learned to play multiple instruments, including trombone and cello. As a high school senior he led the Cut Bank Wolves to the 1966 Class B Boys State basketball championship under coach Willie Degroot before playing basketball at the University of Montana. While at UM, he also successfully auditioned to join the Jubileers singing group. While in the Jubileers he met Steve Riddle, and the two decided to form a band which eventually evolved into the Mission Mountain Wood Band. 1970s and 1980s career The Mission Mountain Wood Band was a bluegrass and country rock band that played their first public performance opening for the band Rare Earth in 1971. The group went on to tour nationally and opened for many notable acts of the era, but were also popular headliners in their local region for events such as the University of Montana's Aber Day kegger. They performed on national television on shows such as Hee Haw and the ABC Cheryl Ladd Special. After the band broke up in 1982, Quist joined with fellow members Terry Robinson and Kurt Bergeron to form the Montana Band, which continued to tour extensively and took first prize in the Willie Nelson country challenge. Quist had left the Montana band prior to a tragic plane crash that killed Robinson, Bergeron and the other members of the band.  Solo career  Quist performing in 2014 \\"Team Quist and the Berners\\" 2017 campaign rally appearance featuring Quist's grown children Halladay (with banjo) and Guthrie (guitarist to right of lectern) As a solo performer Quist formed a backup band called Great Northern. He periodically reunites with the surviving members of the Mission Mountain Wood Band for a small number of concerts. Rob Quist and Great Northern have performed his original music with the North Dakota State Symphony, the Fairbanks Alaska Symphony, the Glacier Orchestra as well as the Billings, Butte, Helena and Missoula Symphonies. He has written and recorded national television and radio ads for Levis 501 Jeans, Amtrak's Empire Builder and Original Coors. His original song, \\"Blue Jean Love Affair\\" was heard in the Top 20 Country Music Markets. During a stint in Nashville, Quist forged a songwriting partnership and enduring friendship with Michael Martin Murphey. Their partnership culminated in their song \\"Close to the Land\\" which became the theme song for the American Public Television program \\"America's Heartland.\\" The song went on to win Song of the Year at the Texas Music Awards. His original song \\"America...Pass It On\\" and video featuring Jack Gladstone won a Finalist Award at the International Wildlife Film Festival for National Geographic, received airplay on Public Television and featured at many Interpretive Centers throughout the United States. Quist has released 15 CDs of mostly original music about the lives and history of the people of Montana and the West, placing his songs on Billboard and Independent Charts. Quist received airplay in Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, Japan and Switzerland. Both as a solo artist and with M2WB, Quist appeared with a number of musical acts including Heart, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, Jimmy Buffett, Dolly Parton,The Allman Brothers Band, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Bonnie Raitt,Parrett, p. 66 the Charlie Daniels Band, Tim McGraw, Martina McBride, and Jay Leno. Quist has been featured on CBS National News in a segment called \\"Country Comes to New York\\"; he was a guest artist on the Riders in the Sky national radio show \\"Riders Radio Theater\\" as well as Montana Public Television. He composed original music for the Montana Repertory Theatre Production \\"Voice of The Prairie\\" and original songs for a production about rodeo in present-day Montana, tentatively titled \\"Cowboy Up.\\" Quist was one of the first honorees to be inducted into the University of Montana School of Fine Art's \\"Hall of Honors\\", saluted as \\"a celebrated Montana musician and composer who has captured the spirit of the West in his music, an evocative and versatile artist whose gift of song has touched the hearts and souls of his countrymen, an eloquent proponent of the history and beauty of the West whose legacy in song will be embraced by generations to follow.\\" Politics =2017 Montana special election= Quist at a March 2017 campaign rally On January 4, 2017, Quist announced he would seek the Democratic nomination for the special election that was anticipated to fill the U.S. House seat held by Ryan Zinke, as Zinke was expected to be nominated to be Secretary of the Interior. Quist was endorsed early on by former Governor Brian Schweitzer, and was selected as the Party's nominee on March 5. Quist stated, \\"I was approached by people who I really respect and they asked me to run. And my first thought was 'Wait a minute, I'm not a politician.' Their response was, 'exactly.'\\" Quist cited as qualifications his work with the state government, lifelong experience traveling in and around Montana, and his upbringing in a ranching family. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders as well as the organization Our Revolution endorsed Quist in the race and campaigned for him. The special election was announced by Governor Steve Bullock on March 1 and set for May 25, the minimum 85 days required after Zinke's confirmation. The race generated considerable national attention, and over $17 million was spent, much of it by outside groups and on television ads, with Quist and third-party organizations supporting him being outspent by about four to one by his opponent Greg Gianforte and Gianforte's supporters. Quist was endorsed by a number of politically progressive organizations as well as various unions, environmental organizations and sportsmen's groups. Quist's opponent had been endorsed over Quist by three Montana newspapers, the Billings Gazette, the Missoulian, and the Helena Independent Record, all owned by Lee Enterprises. However, the day before the election, Gianforte assaulted Ben Jacobs, a reporter from The Guardian, an incident captured on audio recording and which was witnessed by reporters from Fox News. Gianforte was charged with a misdemeanor for the incident. As news broke, the editorial boards of these three newspapers rescinded previous endorsements of Gianforte.Gazette opinion: We're pulling our endorsement of Gianforte, Billings Gazette, Editorial Board, May 24, 2017. Retrieved May 25, 2017. However, as many voters had already cast early voting ballots, the incident had relatively little impact on the election. Gianforte later pled guilty. Quist lost the general election to Gianforte, 50% to 44%, with Libertarian Mark Wicks receiving 6%. This result was the highest percentage of the vote for a Democrat in a Montana house race in the past four election cycles. = Political positions = Bernie Sanders campaigned with Quist the weekend prior to the 2017 special election Politico described Quist's policies as \\"an economic fairness platform\\" and \\"a commitment to Montana's particular brand of prairie populism.\\" According to the Washington Post, the Quist campaign opted not to turn the special election into a referendum on Trump's alleged scandals, but to focus on \\"policy decisions by the president and congressional Republicans.\\" Quist thinks the country should eventually move to a single- payer healthcare system. Quist opposed efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), stating in 2017 that doing so would \\"raise healthcare costs for working Montanans\\", which is consistent with an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, and be a \\"tax cut for millionaires\\". Quist has criticized inequality in the United States, and argued that tax breaks for the rich exacerbates the inequality. He has called for tax cuts for the working class. Quist opposes the privatization of federal lands, military intervention and regime change, as well as any form of religious ban or registry. Quist has called for transferring money from the federal military budget \\"towards health care or Social Security\\". Quist supports a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. He has called for investments in clean coal technology, as well as energy from wind, solar, biomass and geothermal sources. Quist has pledged to protect public lands. Quist supports the legalization of marijuana, saying \\"the war on drugs has been an abject failure.\\" Quist supports same-sex marriage. Quist supports access to birth control, preventive screenings and abortion rights. Quist has argued that \\"the assault on women's reproductive rights\\" must come to an end. He has called for pay equity for women. Quist accepts the scientific consensus on climate change and supports actions to mitigate climate change, saying climate change \\"could have a serious impact on our farms, ranches, and our economy.\\"  References  Bibliography * 1948 births 20th-century American singers 21st- century American politicians 21st-century American singers American banjoists American male singer-songwriters American singer-songwriters Guitarists from Montana Living people Montana Democrats Montana Grizzlies basketball players People from Cut Bank, Montana 20th- century American guitarists American male guitarists American men's basketball players 20th-century male singers 21st-century male singers ","title":"Rob Quist"},{"id":"31545147","text":"Statistics of the V-League in the 2000-01 season.

It runs parallel to Broad Street, connected by Union Street, Queen Victoria Street and Cross Street. At the western end is the Greyfriars Church and at the eastern end are the Town Hall and St Laurence's Church.  History  Friar Street looking west, c. 1875 by Henry Taunt Excavations carried out on Friar Street in 1997 at the location of a proposed extension Marks and Spencer store by the Oxford Archaeological Unit revealed successive layers of old buildings, some of which date back to the 13th century. The Frank Matcham-designed Royal County Theatre, built in 1895, was located on the south side of Friar Street. It burned down in 1937. The opening of a Sainsbury's supermarket in 1963 led to the closure of many smaller shops.  Friars Walk  Friars Walk shopping centre, located at the western end of Friar Street, opened in 1973-4. From around 2009 to 2019 it was derelict. For six years (up until 2018), Friars Walk was known as \\"The Mall\\" and used as a venue for airsoft and immersive zombie survival games. Zed Events have since moved the Zombie Mall experience to a new site to allow for demolition of Friars Walk as part of the Reading Station Hill development. On 1 August 2019, a scaffolding collapse occurred at the demolition site.

She is a Democrat and a member of the Illinois House of Representatives. She was selected to represent the 14th district, on Chicago's North Side, in April 2011 following incumbent Harry Osterman's election to the Chicago City Council. She took office on May 16, 2011. Most notably Kelly Cassidy was the chief sponsor of House Bill 1438, making Illinois the first state to legalize the Adult-Use of Cannabis though legislature, not a ballot measure. Early life and career Cassidy went to Manatee High School in Bradenton, Florida. From 1991 to 1993, she worked as the legislative director for the Chicago chapter of the National Organization for Women. From 1993 to 1997, she worked for state senate president John Cullerton, running his district office. In 1997, Cassidy joined the Cook County state's attorney's office, initially as a legislative liaison. In 2001, she became the director of programs and development for the state's attorney's office, a post she held until her appointment to the legislature in 2011. Cassidy served as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Legislative service Following state representative Harry Osterman's election as 48th ward alderman in February 2011, Cassidy was one of 23 candidates to seek appointment as his successor in the state house. The 14th district, which Osterman was vacating and Cassidy now represents, includes the neighborhoods of Edgewater, Andersonville, and Rogers Park. Per Illinois law, the vacancy was filled by Democratic committeemen from the wards making up the district, their votes weighted to reflect the share of the district falling in each ward. Because more than half of the 14th district's voters live in Chicago's 48th ward, that ward's committeeman ‚Äì former state senator Carol Ronen ‚Äì cast more than half of the votes. On April 17, the committeemen unanimously selected Cassidy to fill the vacancy. In the 2012 Democratic primary, Cassidy was challenged by Paula Basta, a lesbian and longtime North Side activist. On March 20, 2012, Cassidy won the Democratic primary with 6,040 votes (62.4% of the vote) to Basta's 3,636 votes (37.6%). In 2018, J.B. Pritzker appointed Cassidy to the gubernatorial transition's Restorative Justice and Safe Communities Committee. In 2019, Cassidy was an advocate for the Reproductive Health Act, which repealed many restrictions on abortion, including the ban on partial-birth abortions. Personal Cassidy is openly lesbian. Her spouse is Candace Gingrich. She lives with her three sons on the North Side of Chicago. She is one of four openly LGBT members of the Illinois General Assembly, alongside Rep. Greg Harris and Lamont Robinson, both Chicago Democrats, and Sam Yingling, a Democrat from Round Lake Beach, Illinois, a northern suburb of Chicago. Other In 2014 Cassidy was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. In 2019, Cassidy succeeded Joe Moore as the Democratic committeeman for the 49th ward after Moore's loss to Maria Hadden in the 2019 Chicago aldermanic election.

Retrieved on April 18, 2011 was the daughter of Edith Ellen (Nelly) and Gilbert Hyde-Lees, and the wife of the poet William Butler Yeats.Foster, 437 Early life Georgie was born in Fleet, Hampshire on 16 October 1892. When she was only a few years old her parents' marriage failed due to her father's alcoholism. He had enough income to support his family but his wife was in the awkward social position of being a \\"married woman without a husband\\". The family lived a vaguely bohemian and nomadic lifestyle, traveling frequently to country homes and spending long periods visiting relatives. She attended a number of schools in Knightsbridge, London art schools, studied languages and classics, and piano. She became close friends with Dorothy Shakespear, who was fond of Georgie and shared many of her interests despite being six years her senior.Saddlemeyer, 194 After the death of her father in 1909, Georgie's mother married Dorothy's uncle, Henry Tucker, Olivia Shakespear's brother, and they moved to Kensington. W. B. Yeats Her mother often brought young musicians and artists she had recently met to Olivia Shakespear's salon, many of whom became well-known modernists, including Ezra Pound, Walter Rummel, and Frederic Manning. Georgie continued to make the rounds of country estates with her mother and Olivia and Dorothy Shakespear. It was in their company in 1910 or 1911, as a seventeen-year-old, that one morning she met Yeats at the British Museum and again that afternoon during tea at the Shakespears. Seven years later, when she was 25 and he 52, Yeats asked Georgie to marry him. Only a few weeks earlier Iseult Gonne, the daughter of Maud Gonne whom Yeats had loved for many years, had rejected Yeats' marriage proposal. Georgie and Yeats married just three weeks later, on 20 October 1917, in a public registry office, witnessed by her mother and Ezra Pound. During the honeymoon, while Yeats was still brooding about Iseult's rejection, Georgie began the automatic writing which fascinated him. Yeats wrote about her psychography days later in what was to be A Vision, and it held the marriage together for many years. Within a year of marriage Yeats declared her name of Georgie to be insufferable, and henceforth called her George. Personal life The couple had two children, Anne and Michael. Georgie died on 23 August 1968.  References  Sources * Foster, R.F. W.B Yeats: A Life.

White (born 1963) is a Canadian artist and sculptor. He is the Dominion Sculptor of Canada, a position whose duties include the creation of original works of art in sculpture. He works are primarily in figurative art. He is an architectural sculptor and carver and creates works in stone, wood, and bronze.  Early influences  Born in Peterborough, Ontario, in 1963, White was raised in artistic environment where he was encouraged to be creative. He began carving wood and sculpting at very young age. His initial inspiration was a master stonemason and wood carver ‚Äì his grandfather. Later, sculptor Bill Reid and other Haida artists became a major influence. White looked at these works during many family trips to British Columbia. At age 17, he sold his first pieces in commercial art galleries in the Peterborough area and later in Toronto, Ontario. He participated in several group shows at Whetung Gallery and Art Loft Gallery from 1982 to 1986. At Sir Sandford Fleming College, he studied art conservation techniques. Later in the 1980s, he continued his studies for three years at the Canadian Conservation Institute. There he focused on art history, conservation and historical artifacts' restoration, conservation theory, metal and woodworking techniques and traditional finishes.  Early career  After graduation, he pursued a career in conservation and museum collection management with both the Canadian War Museum and the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Ottawa. This period laid the foundations for White's work as Dominion Sculptor, where part of his job is the restoration of architectural sculpture on Parliament Hill. At the Canadian War Museum As Exhibit Artist at the Canadian War Museum, White created sculptures and decorative arts for exhibitions and presentations for both museums.Benoit, Barbara, The Heritage Protectors, a Contingent of Craftspeople is Helping Protect our History, Ottawa Interiors, January 1993 He received commissions to create a series of sculptures in wood, which were later exhibited at the museum.Morse, Jennifer, Canada's War Art, Featured Artist Philip White.

Based on photographs of Paul Manson, former Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada), he created a bronze sculpture of a Cold-War era fighter pilot entitled \\"QRA scramble\\". It is currently on exhibit in the Canadian War Museum's permanent galleries. After he completed the design for the coat of arts for the Canadian War Museum,Mullington, Dave, Leblanc Praises Museum Emblem, Ottawa Citizen, 1 October 1999Gillett, Mitch, Artist Captures the Faces of War, The Maple Leaf his interest in heraldic art and sculpture deepened. His design features hands raising a book, maple leaves, poppies, and a key. \\"The book represents military research and the key is a reminder of the museum's role in protecting the country's military collection and unlocking knowledge,\\" White said. As a result of this work, he received commissions for heraldic carving for Rideau Hall, the Canadian Heraldic Authority, the Canadian Bar Association, and the Canadian Nurses Association.CNA‚Äôs New Coat of Arms Unveiled, Canadian Nurses Association, History  Dominion Sculptor  White applied to a national competition that was held for Dominion Sculptor.The Official Government Sculptor ‚Äì a job steeped in tradition \\"The guardians of sculpted antiquities in Canada's public buildings especially those on Parliament Hill and the source of much original ornamentation for historic buildings left un- embellished at their time of construction,\\" the role encompasses the care of architectural sculpture that already exists and creating original works. He received the appointment in 2006.Bosc, Marc; O'Brien, Audrey (2009), The Parliament Buildings and Grounds, House of Commons Procedure and Practice (2 ed.), Ottawa: Queen's Printer for Canada, White is the fifth sculptor to hold this position. Created in 1936 by the Department of Public Works, the position's mandate is to carry out the decorative work planned by John A. Pearson, the architect of Parliament Hill‚Äôs Centre Block. Rebuilt after the Great Fire destroyed the original building in 1916, Pearson designed the Centre Block with the express intention that future generations of sculptors would create stone carvings and sculptures from stone blocks in the building's interior. White oversees that work and creates original additions, in collaboration and with the approval of the offices of the Speaker of the House of Commons (Canada) and the Speaker of the Senate (Canada). Notwithstanding the longstanding \\"rule against partisan subjects\\" in decorative work on Parliament Hill, within the confines of Neo-Gothic traditions, the position contains considerable scope to create original works. More than 25 different types of stone and marble were used in the building's construction, but much of the exterior carving is done in Tyndall limestone from Manitoba and Indiana limestone. Inside, the history and traditions of Canada are reflected in many stone carvings. This work represents the ongoing intermittent work of over 60 sculptors and carvers since 1916.Bosc, Marc; O'Brien, Audrey (2009), The Parliament Buildings and Grounds, House of Commons Procedure and Practice (2 ed.), Ottawa: Queen's Printer for Canada, Since his appointment, key projects White has produced include a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in bronze for the House of CommonsIsaacson, Fiona. \\"Carving his Place on Parliament Hill\\" The Peterborough Examiner, 20 May 2008 and a portrait of the Queen in stone, for the Senate Foyer in 2010.Galloway, Gloria.

But with the notable exception of John Harman's equestrian statue of the Queen located on the grounds outside, there were no publicly owned sculptural representations of Canada's reigning monarch inside the Parliament buildings. White returned to military themes with a commission to produce a series of six carved oak panels depicting insignia of the Canadian Forces. These were later installed in a meeting room used by the House of Commons Veterans Affairs Committee in Centre Block. White has also created two bronze busts of Sir Sandford Fleming for the lobbies of Fleming College in Peterborough Ontario, and Lindsay, Ontario, and a plaster bust of Fleming for the Haliburton School of the Arts. Commissioned to create a portrait of Elizabeth II for the Department of National Defence & the Royal Canadian Mint in the year of her Diamond Jubilee, White based his portrait on the earlier ones he did for Parliament Hill. But in this portrait, carved in Dura stone, the Queen wears two insignia: Sovereign of the Order of Canada and of the Order of Military Merit (OMM). Displayed in National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, the portrait was commissioned to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Order of Military Merit. It recognizes \\"conspicuous merit and exceptional service by members of the Canadian Forces.\\" On 27 June 2012, White was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

Rankine was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and then studied at University College London (UCL), graduating in 1904 with first-class honours in physics. Following graduation, he worked as an assistant in the UCL physics department from 1904, a position he would remain in until 1919 apart from a period spent doing wartime research. In 1907, he married Ruby Irene Short, with whom he would have two sons and two daughters. University College and World War I During this period at UCL, Rankine worked under the Irish physicist Frederick Thomas Trouton. In 1908, he and Trouton carried out what become known as the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment. This experiment was among a number being carried out at the time, and was intended as a test of aether theory and Einstein's special relativity, with Trouton and Rankine's null result providing support for the latter theory. Two years later, in 1910, Rankine obtained his D.Sc in Physics (awarded by the University of London).The historical record (1836‚Äì1912) being a supplement to the Calendar completed to September 1912, University of London, Hodder & Stoughton, 1912 A further two years after that, in 1912, he was elected a fellow of University College. His research in this period was on the viscosity of gases, and he invented a viscosimeter (the Rankine viscosimeter), enabling him to carry out experimental determinations of the Sutherland constant (described by William Sutherland). The aim of this work was to produce estimates of the size and shape of gas molecules, and Rankine's results in this area were published between 1910 and 1926. While at UCL, Rankine also served twice as President of 'The Chemical and Physical Society' (ChemPhysSoc), the students' society of the chemistry and physics departments, doing so in the years 1910‚Äì11 and 1915‚Äì16.History ‚Äì Past ChemPhysSoc Presidents, History of UCL, University College London.

Rankine's wartime research took place in 1917 and 1918, and he worked under recently appointed UCL professor William Henry Bragg and British-born Canadian physicist Arthur Stewart Eve. Rankine worked first at Aberdour on the Firth of Forth in Scotland, then at the Harwich research station, both as part of work by the Admiralty Research Laboratory. His final posting was as Director of the research station at Kingswear. Rankine's work during this period included developing submarine detection technology. Rankine's research during and immediately after the war also looked at ways to achieve the optical transmission of sound, a problem being worked on by other scientists and engineers in several countries. The device was similar to the photophone constructed by US inventor Alexander Graham Bell in the 1880s, and the system being developed by the Polish engineer Joseph Tykoci≈Ñski-Tykociner from 1918. Rankine's work in this area was mentioned in Popular Science in 1922,Will America or England Win Race to Make Movies Talk?, Popular Science, October 1922, p.29 and has been described as an \\"effective technique for the transmission of speech by sunlight\\".A History of Optics at Imperial College London, Imperial College London.

Retrieved 18 April 2011 He was the second holder of this post, succeeding Frederic John Cheshire, and the department name was changed at his request (it had previously been the Optical Design Department). From 1931 onwards, Rankine was again solely Professor of Physics following the merger of the Technical Optics Department with the Physics Department, with Louis Claude Martin taking over as leader of what was now a postgraduate section (and today is the photonics section). These changes mirrored Rankine's shift in interests from optics to the newly emerging field of geophysics. His interest in this area developed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and from 1927 onwards he became an advisor for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later the Anglo-Iran Oil Company, and later still British Petroleum). It was in 1934 that the School of Applied Geophysics was established at Imperial College, with Rankine directing the research.The history of Imperial College London, 1907‚Äì2007, Hannah Gay, World Scientific, 2007 His work in this area included improving the gravimeter invented by Lor√°nd E√∂tv√∂s (the E√∂tv√∂s gravimeter) and constructing a magnetometer \\"of great sensitivity\\". In 1937, Rankine resigned from Imperial College to take up a full-time position with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, in which role he made several visits to Persia (Iran). This resignation was marked by the following rhyme, published in 1937 in The Record of the Royal College of Science Association: > If Rankine prefers travel > To academic toil, > No one of us will cavil, > At the fact that he's struck oil. On his departure, Rankine became Emeritus Professor of Physics at Imperial College, holding that title from 1937 to his death.

These included being asked to present the 1932 Royal Institution Christmas Lecture, which he gave under the title: 'The Round of the Waters'. In 1934 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He was also made the Guthrie Lecturer in 1949, delivering the 33rd Guthrie Lecture on 19 March 1949, titled 'Experimental Studies in Thermal Convection'. World War II and later years During World War II, Rankine again worked for the government, this time on the development of the FIDO system for clearing fog from military runways. This work was done with the Petroleum Warfare Department, and he contributed to both the design and testing done on the system in wind tunnels at the Empress Hall, Earls Court. The system was then developed further by Arthur Hartley, and when brought into operation helped to save the lives of many World War II aircrews. After the war, Rankine resumed his work with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for a few years before resigning from full-time work in 1947. He continued as an advisor for the company until 1954 when his health began to break down.

Muslims, Christians, and Jews co-existed for over seven centuries in the Iberian Peninsula during the era of Al-Andalus states. The degree to which the Christians and the Jews were tolerated by their Muslim (predominantly Arab) rulers is a subject widely contested among historians. The history of Al- Andalus indicates that Muslims, Christians, and Jews who lived within Al- Andalus had relatively peaceful relations, with the exception of a few scattered revolts, and times of religious persecution. The great amount of cultural and social interaction that took place between these three distinct social and religious groups led to the creation of a unique and diverse culture that continued to flourish even after the Reconquista. Social interaction The Muslim Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula signaled the coming together of three different religions and the social customs and culture associated with each. This period has become known as the Convivencia, meaning culture of coexistence. Although this idea of a culture of tolerance is disputed by some historians, only a few instances of revolts and violence were actually recorded. This does not mean that discrimination by Muslims did not occur at the local level. However, the more educated classes of Muslims respected Christians and Jews under Islamic law as dhimmis (protected peoples) or ‚ÄòPeoples of the Book.‚Äô It is important to note that the Muslim and Berber soldiers who carried out the conquest formed only a small minority of the population of the Iberian Peninsula. Thus the emergence of this unique Islamic society that formed in Al-Andalus was a slow and uneven process. In order to understand how these distinct cultures and societies meshed into one, over time, it is important to recognize what was distinct about each and how they were viewed within the broader society. =Muslims= A self-depiction by the Muslims in Iberia. Taken from the Tale of Bayad and Riyad. In Al-Andalus, Muslims were divided into three distinct ethnic groups. The largest group was the Berbers. It is important to note that these Berbers, which mostly came from North Africa, were mostly sedentary in lifestyle, not to be confused with the Nomadic Berbers found in roughly the same geographic region of North Africa. In terms of social class, after the invasion, Berbers mostly went on to form the rural proletariat, although a number of them went to the cities, mostly working to pursue crafts. In terms of religion the Berbers were all Muslims, their ancestors having converted mostly to share in the wealth of Arab conquests. The second group of Muslims found in Al-Andalus was the Arabs. They formed a relatively small section of Al-Andalus‚Äô total population. They tended to have a higher economic position in society and constituted the majority of the ruling class. They owned land in the richest parts of the country. The most important cultural elements they brought with them were their language and the Arabic tradition of learning and high culture, which emulated that which could be found in Caliphate of Damascus. However, the actual amount of culture these Arab invaders actually brought with them has been disputed by some historians. Historian W. Montgomery Watt argues that the ancestors of the Arabs that came to invade the Iberian Peninsula had been living a very rough life in the Steppes of Arabia, thus the actual invaders had little time to acquire a high level of culture. These Arab and Berber invaders were also busy consolidating their control, having little time and money to devote to purposefully spreading culture to the newly conquered regions. The Iberian Umayyad golden age was also, in part, a result of its geographic location and relative isolation from the central part of the Arabian empire. These Umayyad rulers felt the need to prove that they were the equals of those in the homeland. This was combined with their need to prove their worth as an independent region. It can thus be concluded that the invading Arabs brought some level of culture to the peninsula, but the high culture that was achieved during the golden age of Al-Andalus was the result of the combination and growth of the multiple cultures present in the geographic area. The Muwallads, or Muslims of Iberian descent, were far more numerous than those of purely Arabic descent. They were composed of those descended from the marriages of the original invading Arabs to the native women of Iberia along with those who converted to Islam by choice since the invasions. The muwallads adopted Arabic genealogies and thus became further fused to the Arabs ethnically over time. By the 10th century, no clear distinction existed between the muwallads and the Arab Muslims and by the 10th century, Muslims represented about 80% of the total population of Al-Andalus, including Christian converts and the Berber Muslims. =Christians= 200px The Christians living in Al-Andalus, both before and after the invasion, were the Visigoths, Hispano-Romans, and the native tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. The Visigoths and the Hispano-Romans formed the noble class prior to the Arab- Berber invasion. The Christian population as a whole was predominantly Catholic, although some Paganism and Arianism still persisted in some areas, mixing with the Catholic tradition. Under the Christian Visigoth rule, a tradition of learning had been established at Seville by Isidore (636 AD). Over time, Seville became one of the leading intellectual centers of Christian Europe. This Isidorian tradition seems to have been abandoned in favor of the Arabic tradition, although it undoubtedly played a role in the further development of the Arabic tradition on the peninsula. After the Muslim invasion, the Christians were classified under Islamic law as dhimmis (protected peoples). This status allowed them to practice their religion freely under the Umayyad dynasty. Christians were allowed to maintain many of their churches and the organization of the Church remained mostly intact, with the exception of the confiscation of many Catholic properties. Bishops and other high ranking church officials had to be approved by the Caliphate before they could take office. Although culturally many Christians adopted the Arabic tradition, the cultural tradition of the Catholic Church and the culture that had developed under the Visigoths was maintained in monasteries by monks. The strong monastic tradition throughout the southern portion of the Iberian Peninsula continued to flourish and develop under Muslim rule. Within the cities, some Christians were able to rise to prominent positions within the Umayyad bureaucracy. One example is of a Christian with the adopted name of [Abu Umar ibn Gundislavus], who became vizier under Abd al-Rahman III. Another example being, Revemund, a Christian who was a secretary under the same ruler and was later sent as an ambassador to Germany in 955‚Äì6. He eventually became the bishop of Elvira. It is also important to note that Christian artisans, especially from the Eastern Roman Empire, were called to work on various building projects in the Caliphate of Cordoba. Some of these artisans remained integrated into Andalusian society. Although Christians lost the absolute dominant status they had previously experienced in Iberia, they were still able to gain positions of prominence under Muslim rule, however, these conditions deteriorated with the Almoravids and Almohads (see Restrictions Imposed on Christians and Jews). =Jews= 150px Jews formed an iota, yet significant ethnic minority in the Iberian Peninsula, constituting about 5% of the total population in Al-Andalus. They began to settle in the Iberian Peninsula in significant numbers around the 1st century AD. Under Christian Visigothic rule, Jews faced persecution. In 613, the Visigothic King Sisebut issued a decree which forced Jews to convert to Christianity or be exiled and have their property confiscated. It comes as no surprise that many Jews welcomed their Muslim rulers and saw the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula as deliverance. After the conquest, under Islamic law, Jews were also categorized as dhimmis, having the same social standing as Christians. The Jewish communities scattered throughout the rural areas of Al-Andalus remained fairly isolated, however Jews living in cities and towns, like those in Cordoba that became integrated into Islamic culture and society. Jews came to hold very influential positions in the Umayyad bureaucracy. One example is the Jewish scholar and physician Hasdai ibn Shaprut, who served as a diplomat of the Umayyad government. Many Jews living in the cities also became involved in trade as merchants. Under the Caliphate of Cordoba, Jews experienced [A Golden Age of Jewish Culture] within Spain, in which Jewish scholars, philosophers, and poets prospered. Jews also contributed to the scientific and mathematic fields of study prominent in Cordoba at this time. Overall, Jews were granted better treatment, with the coming of the Muslims invaders, than they had previously experience under Christian rule. Conditions deteriorated under Almoravid and Almohad rule (see Restrictions Imposed on Christians and Jews). Restrictions imposed on Christians and Jews Although Christians and Jews experienced a relatively high degree of religious and social freedom under Muslim rule, they did lack certain rights that were reserved exclusively for Muslims. The dihimmis, which included both Christians and Jews, were required to pay an annual poll tax called a jizya. If a non-Muslim also owned a substantial amount of cultivatable land, they were required to pay the kharaj or land-tax. There were also certain restrictions and taxes levied on the church buildings themselves. Certain religious practices like processions, chanting, and church bell ringing, were also censored by law, although the enforcement of these laws varied from region to region. Under Islamic law, dihimmis were supposed to assume a subordinate position in that they were not allowed to hold authority over any Muslim. In practice, this was not the case, as many Christians and Jews acquired positions in the Cordoban bureaucracy as tax collectors, translators, and secretaries. That being said, there were numerous advantages to converting to Islam. The ability for social mobility changed drastically upon conversion to Islam. Converts had a greater ability to acquire wealth and status. Slaves were also instantly freed and enfranchised if they converted to Islam reciting the Shahada. Under the Almoravids tensions grew as more and more restrictions were forced upon non- Muslims, although a certain level of prosperity for religious minorities was still maintained under their rule. Under the Almohads these relative eras of tolerance ended with many Christians and Jews being forced to convert to Islam or face persecution. Many churches and synagogues were destroyed during Almohad rule and many Christians and Jews moved to the newly conquered Christian city of Toledo. Overall, relations between the various religious groups varied from region to region and the term convivencia, or culture of tolerance, cannot be universally applied to Al-Andalus. Ibn Hazn (1064), a prominent poet and philosopher from Cordoba, described the Christian community as ‚Äòaltogether vile,‚Äô demonstrating that prejudices against Christians persisted in Al-Andalus, although it is hard to gauge to what degree since they varied from region to region. The invasion of the Almoravids, and later the Almohads, signaled a shift and eventual end to the religious tolerance fostered under the Caliphate. Social mobility and conversion Conversion to Islam translated into a higher rate of social mobility for Christians and Jews alike. There is little documentation available to indicate the conversion rates of Jews in Al-Andalus, although the numbers of Jewish converts have been estimated as relatively small. This is perhaps due to the tightly knit Jewish communities that had formed before the Muslim invasion. Christians on the other hand were more eager to convert to Islam. Many wished to secure higher ranking government positions; while others took such liking to Islamic teaching and culture that they felt compelled to convert. Half of the Christians in Al-Andalus are reported to have converted to Islam by the 10th century, with more than 80% by the 11th century. Many Christians who did not accept Islam as their religion became increasingly Arabized in terms of culture. These Christians, known as Mozarabs or musta‚Äôribs, a word meaning ‚ÄòArabized‚Äô, adopted the Arabic language and customs. Although the high conversion rates, as well as the adaptation of Arab culture homogenized the society of Al-Andalus to a degree, factionalism still persisted, which lead to occasional revolts and conflicts between the major religious groups. Religious and social conflicts At the time of the invasion, many Christians did indeed resist Muslim rule. In these early years, certain kingdoms within Al-Andalus itself attempted to retain semi-autonomous status under Muslim rule, but were soon forced to submit. Many Christians also fled to the mountains up north and eventually formed the northern Christian kingdoms of Iberia that would eventually bring down Islamic rule, through the Reconquista. After this initial struggle, religious fervor did not manifest itself in the form of any significant religious revolts. This is shown by the fact that not a single religious revolt took place during the 8th century within Al-Andalus. However, in the middle of the 9th century, a small group of zealous Christians led by Eulogius of Cordoba, a priest who was later canonized by the Catholic Church as a Saint, caused a stir mostly around Cordoba by encouraging Muslims to convert to Christianity and publicly denouncing Islamic teaching. Both of these acts were punishable by death under Islamic law. These outbursts were mostly tied to the monastic movement and purposeful [martyrdom]. Between 851 and 859 AD, Eulogius and forty-eight other Christians were put to death. The movement did not gain widespread support from Christians in Al-Andalus and after the executions the movement subsided. Religious tolerance deteriorated under the Almoravids and the Almohads. Around the year 1000 AD, Jews were being persecuted throughout Al-Andalus, although the city of Toledo still remained fairly tolerant. The Almohads were especially severe in their treatment of non-Muslims and persecution of Christians and Jews prompted many to migrate from Al-Andalus. Hybridization of cultures: architecture and art By understanding the background and social standing of each individual religious and ethnic group, as well as their individual cultural backgrounds within Al-Andalus, it is possible to understand how the culture of Al-Andalus formed into, not a completely unified new culture, but rather a composite hybrid culture. These cultural aspects have withstood the test of time and prove as the most evident examples of this hybridization that can be seen in the art, architecture, language, and literature of Al-Andalus. The hybrid works that were produced under, and resulted from Muslim rule of Al-Andalus, resulted in what has become known as the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain and laid the foundation for the European Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. =Art and architecture= Moorish architecture of the praying hall. Interior of the synagogue. A casket made of ivory with carved decoration and engraved silver demonstrating traditional Islamic art. It is important to note that a distinction between Islamic art and architecture is not important since the two are often tied together. Muslim art is limited, in a sense, by Islamic religious dogmas that frown upon the glorification of human being or animals in the form of art. Thus Muslim art tends to avert from depicting people or animals in art. The art of Al-Andalus had a distinctly Arabic and Islamic inspired flavor, and manifested itself mostly in sculptures and mosaics, as well as, other artifacts that served a dual purpose besides that of being aesthetically pleasing. What made these works distinctly Andalusian was the combination of various artistic elements from Catholic, Classical Roman, and Byzantine artistic traditions. The culmination of Christian and Moorish art culminated in the 11th century. This style became known as the Mozarabic art. This artistic style included ceramics which incorporated mosaic works. It also included the use of repetitive patterns revolving around flower-like designs within sculptures and crafted works. Moorish ivory caskets in Al-Andalus showed signs of western influences. Some depicted individual people and human forms, an element that is not typical in Islamic art. Visigothic tradition also had an influence on the rulers of Cordoba as they adopted the crowns in the style of those worn by Visigothic kings. Many of these artistic elements were incorporated into architectural works, which reflected Muslim rulers‚Äô desire to associate themselves with their ancestral roots in the Middle East, and indeed to assert their Arabic heritage, even though many of these rulers were hybrids even in terms of their genealogy. This is indicative of the multi-cultural influences that culminated in the unique architectural style of Al-Andalus. One famous example that illustrates this desire of Muslim rulers‚Äô to tie themselves to their ancestral homeland, while at the same inadvertently reflecting their multiculturalism, is the Great Mosque of Cordoba. Construction began under the reign of Abd ar-Rahman I in 784 AD and was completed in 987 AD. It was built in part to demonstrate the linkage between Al-Andalus and the ancestral land of the Arabs in Syria. The Great Mosque of Cordoba's architectural layout and style shares many similarities with the Great Mosque of Damascus (completed 715). They share many of the same features like the prayer halls, high ceilings held by double-tiered arcades on columns, and many mosaics. The two also share similar foundation myths, which further points to Muslim attempts in Al-Andalus to reconnect to a nostalgic sense of homeland. Despite these similarities, the mosque is not purely Arabic in style. It is a combination of Roman, Byzantine, and Visigothic architectural elements. The capitals and columns closely emulate older Visigothic and Roman buildings found throughout the city of Cordoba. The red and white colored arches are also reminiscent of the Roman aqueduct of Merida. The mosaics themselves, although connected to those at the Great Mosques of Damascus, are also a hybrid of Christian and Arabic influence. The artisans that produced these mosaics, both at the Great Mosque and at the Cordoban palace estate al- Rustafa, were called from Byzantium. Another example of the cultural exchange within architecture is illustrated by the Medina Azahara, meaning beautiful city, on the outskirts of Cordoba started in 996 AD, by Abd-ar-Raham III al- Nasir, which served as the capital of the Iberian Caliphate. Roman influences can be seen throughout with the incorporation of an old Roman statue of a goddess present in the gardens of the building. The feminine form also appeared on all the various gates to the city. The capitals and columns of the palace are also in the style of Christian cathedrals, while Byzantine influence is also seen throughout the construction of the palace. Byzantium artisans are believed to have come to teach these techniques to Andalusian artisans. Some of the original Byzantium artisans also remained in Al-Andalus and became integrated into Andalusian society. Likewise, Christians and Jews adopted the Arabic architectural elements into their own churches and synagogues built under Moorish rule. This became known as the Mozarabic style. Mozarabic architecture included the absence of exterior decoration, diversity of floor plans, the use of the horseshoe arch in the Islamic style, and the use of the column as support, with a capital decorated with vegetable elements. Moorish styled architecture continued to be popular long after Muslim rule was pushed out of Spain by the Reconquista. Many Christian Cathedrals were built in the Moorish architectural style. Jewish synagogues, like the Sinagoga del Transito in Toledo (built between 1357‚Äì1363), were built in the Moorish style. The Spanish-Moorish artistic style that is exemplified by the Sinagoga del Transito became known as the Mudejar style. Overall, the architecture of Al-Andalus is reflective of the cultural exchange that took place between Christian and Arabic architectural styles, the latter being representative of the need of Muslims leaders to form a connectedness with their ancestral homelands. =Language and literature= Manuscript page by Maimonides, one of the greatest Jewish scholars of Al Andalus, born in C√≥rdoba. Arabic language in Hebrew letters The first Arabic numerals in the West. Much like art and architecture, language and literature are best understood as evolving together through a hybridization process, in the context of Al-Andalus. It is also important to note that language and literature also had a huge impact on all ideas that flowed into all areas of study, which will be briefly touched on in this section. The Muslim invasion of Iberia brought about [universal education], which in turn significantly raised literacy rates, compared to the rest of Christian Europe at this time, although rural areas still had lower literacy rates. The literature of Al- Andalus represents a combination of Arabic, Christian, and Jewish styles, which fused over time under the Caliphate of Cordoba. The Arabic tradition in Al-Andalus has its roots in the Qur‚Äôan and in Arabic poems. These poems tended to have both religious and secular subject matter. Some of these poems contained secular themes and love stories that would later be influential to Iberian literature. By the 9th century these poems became lyrical and almost musical in nature. These types of musical poems became known as muwashshahs. The Muslims also introduced translations of ancient Greek and Roman works that had been lost during the Dark Ages. The Muslim invaders declared Arabic the official language of Al-Andalus, but Arabic was only used by a small minority within the region. Variations of Romance dialects persisted in many areas and the dialect varied from area to area with no clear boundaries. These Romance languages eventually fused with Arabic and some elements of Hebrew to form the Mozarabic dialect, which became influential in the literature produced in this geographic area. The later dispersion of Mozarabs across the Iberian peninsula explains why many of the words in modern-day Spanish, Portuguese, and Catalan are derived from these early Mozarabic Romance dialects. It must be stressed that no standard language existed on the Iberian Peninsula as a whole, or even in Al-Andalus itself, at the time this style took shape. This newly formed Mozarabic style first appeared in literature in the kharjas or choruses of the muwashshahs. These kharjas were usually written in Arabic or Hebrew, but eventually appeared in a vernacular Mozarabic. style A literal mixture of phrases from the Iberian vernacular, Hebrew, and Arabic was not uncommon in the kharjas. Kharjas are of great importance to the Iberian literary and linguistic tradition because they represent a hybridization of the Christian and Classical tradition of having repetitive choruses as those found in earlier lyric poems, with the Hebrew and Arabic tradition which emphasized love and the everyday struggles of life. This combination was important to linguistic development as vernacular Romance languages began to adopt and alter Arabic or Hebrew words found in the kharjas. The evolution of the Mozarabic style in language and literature perpetuated what has come to be called the Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain. The dates for this so-called golden age are widely disputed although they correspond roughly with the beginning of the Caliphate of Cordoba, entering a decline under Almoravid rule, and being put to an end under Almohad rule. Jewish authors living in Al- Andalus became inspired by the influx of ideas that came with the wealth of literature. This literature represented both a translation of classical Greek and Roman works under rulers like al-Hakam II, which had been lost to Europeans previous to the Muslim invasion, and also the coming together of Christian and Arab ideas into entirely new works. Muslim universities, libraries, courts, and to some degree Christian monasteries were hubs for literature, the former were also hubs for the hybridization of literature and thus of ideas. Foreigners from across Europe and the Middle East came to these universities in Al-Andalus, contributing their own ideas, and translating many of the works in Al-Andalus upon their return home. As a result of this literary exchange, a wealth of new literature on the subject of theology, philosophy, science, and mathematics was produced during this time. The works of Jewish philosopher and theologian Maimonides, Muslim polymath Ibn Rushd(Averroes), Muslim physician Abulcasis, Jewish scholar and physician Hasdai ibn Shaprut, are direct products of the cultural exchange manifested through literature. Their ideas are immortalized through literature, like the novelist Ibn Tufail whose work inspired John Locke‚Äôs theory of tabula rasa, which produced far-reaching waves. Both Jewish and Christian scholars adopted Arabic as their language of choice for academic purposes. Jewish poet Moses ben Jacob ibn Ezra, and Christian bishop Recemundus were both bilingual, the latter writing an Arabic-Christian liturgical calendar. Literary development continued under the Almoravids, although a gradual decline occurred as a result of stricter enforcement of Islamic laws. Under the Almohads, the progressive development of literature, previously started under the Caliphate of Cordoba, almost ceased, with the Almohads censuring works they considered to undermine the authority of the Qur‚Äôan. Scholars, like Maimonides, were persecuted and forced to flee. The eventual expulsion of the Almohads, which resulted from the Christian Reconquista, saw a re-emergence of the literary works produced under the Caliphate of Cordoba. The Christian kingdoms of Iberia attempted to uphold the beacon of this literary tradition with the translation of many Arabic and Hebrew works into Latin and later the vernacular (see Toledo School of Translators).

He was born in Albany, Georgia, and moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he attended the Art Institute of Chicago. After graduation, he became heavily involved in the local art scene and through his early work he explored the working life of blacks in Chicago and found influence in the sights and sounds of jazz music. In the late 1960s he opened WJ Studio and Gallery, where he, along with his wife, Jae, hosted regional artists and musicians. Mid-1960s Chicago saw a rise in racial violence leading to the examination of race relations and black empowerment by local artists. Jarrell became involved in the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC), a group that would serve as a launching pad for the era's black art movement. In 1967, OBAC artists created the Wall of Respect, a mural in Chicago that depicted African American heroes and is credited with triggering the political mural movement in Chicago and beyond. In 1969, Jarrell co-founded AFRICOBRA: African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists. AFRICOBRA would become internationally acclaimed for their politically themed art and use of \\"coolade colors\\" in their paintings. Jarrell's career took him to Africa in 1977, where he found inspiration in the Senufo people of Ivory Coast, Mali and Burkina Faso. Upon return to the United States he moved to Georgia and taught at the University of Georgia. In Georgia, he began to use a bricklayer's trowel on his canvases, creating a textured appearance within his already visually active paintings. The figures often seen in his paintings are abstract and inspired by the masks and sculptures of Nigeria. These Nigerian arts have also inspired Jarrell's totem sculptures. Living and working in Cleveland, Jarrell continues to explore the contemporary African American experience through his paintings, sculptures, and prints. His work is found in the collections of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, High Museum of Art, The Studio Museum in Harlem and the University of Delaware. Personal life =Early life= Jarrell was born in Albany, Georgia, in 1929 to Solomon Marcus and Tabitha Jarrell. Named after the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, he was the youngest of six children.Douglas, 1. A year after Jarrell's birth the family moved to a 28-acre farm near Athens, Georgia, where they grew vegetables and cotton. Jarrell's father was a carpenter and furniture maker who had his own business, the S.M. Jarrell Furniture Store.Douglas, 2. All three Jarrell boys worked there, one of them learning to cane chairs. Their father's artistic ability and mother's skill as a quilt-maker contributed to the entire family's love for art. As a child, Jarrell first attended a one-room schoolhouse where he was encouraged by his teacher, Jessie Lois Hall, to explore his artistic side. He then went to a private Baptist school starting in the seventh grade before transferring to Athens High in the tenth grade. In high school his talent for art was apparent as he started creating his own comic strip, cartoons for the school paper, and illustrations for sports events, finally taking up oil painting. As a young man interested in art during the late 1930s and early 1940s he learned about painting and illustration through magazines such as the Saturday Evening Post and Collier's. Unable to figure out the distinction between illustration and painting, Jarrell thought \\"artists eventually got rich ‚Äì but it was illustrators making the large sums of money.\\"Douglas, 2‚Äì3. Jarrell's relationship with his mother became closer once his father and one of his brothers left to work at a shipyard during World War II. His father died of malaria while working there. While in high school, Jarrell helped his mother tend the farm, but did not like the work. After graduating from high school, he joined the Army, was stationed at Fort Polk, Louisiana and served briefly in Korea. At Fort Polk he became company artist and made extra money designing shirts and making paintings for fellow soldiers.Douglas, 5. =Higher education and current life= After military service, Jarrell moved to Chicago where his sister Nellie attended Northwestern University. It was in Chicago where Jarrell would have his first museum experiences. Growing in up Georgia, African Americans were not allowed to visit museums until the Civil Rights Act of 1964, therefore these early museum visits made a major impression on him. A year later he enrolled at the Art Institute of Chicago for advertising art and graphic design, where he attended night classes. His days were spent working at the International Paint company where he mixed paint. He also took classes at the Ray Vogue School for Commercial Arts. He began attending the Art Institute full-time in 1954. Jarrell eventually lost interest in commercial art and focused on classes about painting and drawing, gaining inspiration from instructor Laura McKinnon and her ideas about spatial relationship theory. In 1958, he graduated with his original major(s), retaining a strong desire to pursue the life of a fine artist. At this time he also met artist Jeff Donaldson, who became a friend who influenced his career. In 1959, the year of his first marriage, he became an advertising photographer, taking photos of type and lettering styles. The couple would divorce shortly after the marriage.Douglas, 7. In 1963, Jarrell met Elaine Annette Johnson, known as Jae, who ran a clothing boutique,Douglas, 19. the woman who became his second wife on June 2, 1967.Douglas, 22. They spent their honeymoon in Nassau and on January 7, 1968, Wadsworth Jr. was born. During the pregnancy Jae closed her boutique and moved into Jarrell's studio, running a mail order service instead.Douglas, 24. As the social and economic world of Chicago declined, gang violence threatened the family's neighborhood. After their second child, Jennifer, was born the family decided to move to the New York City area.Douglas, 36. In May 1971, they made the move, first heading to Waterbury, Connecticut, then New Haven before spending three months in Boston. The family then moved to Washington, D.C. where Jarrell began teaching at Howard University in 1971, recruited by Jeff Donaldson.Douglas, 39. At Howard he pursued his MFA, focusing on African culture, specifically the Senufo people.Douglas, 42. The couple would have another daughter, Roslyn Angela, in 1972. S Struggling to fit in at Howard, unable to make tenure, and with concerns about the increasing crime rates in Washington, the family decided to move once again in 1977,Douglas, 50. this time to Athens, Georgia. Shortly after the move Jarrell became an assistant professor at the University of Georgia. He and his wife started a high-end educational toy company that stemmed from their children's love for similar toys when living in Washington, D.C.Douglas, 53. They opened a small shop called Tadpole Toys and Hobby Center in Athens to great reception. However, as a result of poor sales in May 1982 they were forced to close it. Soon afterwards, Jarrell received tenure at the University.Douglas, 64. In 1988, he retired from his position and from teaching as a whole in order to focus on his creative work. By 1994 all three children were grown; the two daughters attended the Art Institute of Chicago, and Wadsworth Jr. became a seafarer. That year, Jae and daughter Jennifer moved to New York to find a place to live, settling in SoHo, where they were joined by Jarrell a few months later.Douglas, 91. Currently, Jarrell and Jae live and work in Cleveland, Ohio. Artistic career =Chicago= After graduation from the Art Institute, Jarrell lived off his wages from mixing paint and furthered his skills in his studio for a year. He started to submit his work to competitions, being accepted at the Chicago Show at the Navy Pier and the Union League Show. Jarrell produced artworks inspired by theories learned in school and scenes of everyday life in black Chicago. With an interest in horse racing, jazz clubs and bars, he often took a sketchpad on his explorations, eventually creating paintings like Neon Row (1958), a street scene, Shamrock Inn (1962), a bar scene, and The Jockeys #1 (1962), from a visit to a horse racing track. These themes would recur throughout his career. His early works display the \\"two-dimensional illusionism\\" he learned in school: linear and geometric perspective with overlapping objects receding to a vanishing point on the horizon. Color is used to depict movement and stability, a contrast seen in Shamrock Inn and The Jockeys #1, however, Jarrell's palette had evolved into brighter and bolder color combinations, at times contrasting in their final execution. The influence of post-impressionism is evident in these earlier works, in line with art education trends at the time.Douglas, 9. A notable turning point for his career came in 1963 when a watercolor (similar to Jazz Giants #1 (1962)) was accepted for the Art Institute's \\"2nd Biennial Drawing, Watercolor and Print Exhibition.\\" The exhibit earned him prizes, media attention, and the opportunity to exhibit his work at other galleries throughout the Midwest. He moved to a large studio in the Hyde Park neighborhood and continued expanding on his work and focusing on musical and sport related themes. His pigment application became rapid, whether he was depicting a jazz musician or a jockey on his horse, allowing the image to express strong movement. Cockfight (1965) shows the evolution of Jarrell's work: intense color bands, swirls, and at times a psychedelic appearance to the bird in focus, a style that became a mainstay in his work.Douglas, 10. Influenced by his honeymoon in the Caribbean, Jarrell became interested in the effects of man-made and natural sunlight on the environment. Experimentation with pigments, media, imagery and design allowed him to create artworks that fully expressed his intended messages. Referring to works such as Nassau (1968) and Sign of the Times (1966), Jarrell commented: \\"The colors of the Bahamas influenced my use of color and my approach to my work.\\" With Sign of the Times he shows a street scene, his first attempt at a painting involving social interaction. In 1968, Jarrell became art director at Sander Line Graphics, only to quit shortly thereafter to become self-employed. Aside from creating his art he also started a successful mail-order photo processing business. Soon after Jarrell and Jae decided to open a gallery space below their studio: WJ Studio and Gallery. While the studio and gallery flourished, Jarrell taught part-time art classes at Wadsworth Elementary School and considered moving to New York, seeking refuge in the heart of the art world.Douglas, 35. Wall of Respect In 1964 Chicago experienced two major race riots. Triggered by Civil Rights struggles and angst, more riots followed in subsequent years and the Black Power movement came into fruition. Artists began to explore ways to express black pride, self-determination and self-reliance leading in 1966 to the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC). Artist Norman Parish asked Jarrell to attend a meeting for OBAC's Artists' Workshop. The meetings would consist of artists bringing their work to be critiqued and reflect on ideas of the black experience in art, leading to the concept behind Wall of Respect. The mural consisted of African American heroes and personalities, each artist deciding who should be depicted in their section. Sylvia Abernathy designed the layout, giving Jarrell a 12 √ó 14-foot space to share with photographer Bill Abernathy.Douglas, 20. Jarrell focused on a favorite theme, rhythm and blues, and featured portrayals of James Brown, B.B. King, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, Aretha Franklin and Dinah Washington. The Artists' Workshop would sour towards the end of the project: there were controversies stemming from the painting in Norman Parish's section, conflicts regarding copyrights being sold without permission, disagreements on law enforcement involvement, as well as deceit. Nevertheless the Wall was considered a success, triggering the creation of liberation themed murals in Chicago and beyond. WJ Studio and Gallery In 1968, Jarrell and his wife opened WJ Studio and Gallery, below their home and studio. The space not only showcased the couple's work and that of other artists but went on to display the talents of Chicago poets and musicians. Jarrell's love for blues and jazz music made it easy for him to access the city's talent and his involvement with OCAC provided him with contacts in the poetry world. Artists such as Muhal Richard Abrams, John Stubblefield, Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton and the Chicago Art Ensemble would perform at the space.Douglas, 25. The gallery also served as a gathering place for the likes of Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Gerald Williams and others, who would come to discuss concepts of a relevant black art aesthetic. The group struggled: Jarrell described the search as an attempt to find \\"a collective concept that would say 'black art' at a glance.\\"Douglas, 26. Eventually, the group made a breakthrough while listing principles and ideas regarding the concept of black art; the term \\"coolade colors\\" was contributed by a fabric designer. The term covered the bright fashion of stylish African American men of the time, which Jarrell described as \\"loud lime, pimp yellows, hot pinks, high-key color clothing.\\" The final concept for their aesthetic search would be message oriented art, revolving around socially aware content. African design would be included and meaningfulness for black people would be a necessity. This group's formation would be considered one of the best aligned and organized collectives in the Black Arts Movement. This group went on to form COBRA.Douglas, 29. COBRA and the black aesthetic Like many African American grass roots organizations, Jarrell's gallery group struggled to carry the torch after the deaths of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X. Jarrell and his fellow Chicago artists took the path of non-violence by way of their artistic talents and a sense of ownership through their contributions at WJ Studio and Gallery. With these ideals backing them and their new aesthetic philosophy, the group took on the name COBRA ‚Äì Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists. With the creation of COBRA, Jarrell completed his first work that conceptualized the concept behind the group, Black Family (1969), which utilized the color scheme of the coolade colors such as light blue and orange contrasting with white areas, which heightened the bright colors' intensity. This technique allowed Jarrell to create what he described as an \\"intuitive space,\\" drawing the viewer's attention towards the family on the canvas: a caring mother, protective father and two relaxed children. With a father depicting strength and honesty, and what Robert Douglas describes as a \\"heroic quality,\\" to the painting, Jarrell expresses important aspects of the COBRA ideal. Writing also appears on the canvas, with the word \\"blackness\\" represented by the letter B. The group decided to go from focusing on themed exhibitions to encouraging artworks that \\"portray the general problems of black people or attempt to visualize some solutions to them.\\"Douglas, 30. AFRICOBRA's beginnings A model wearing Jae Jarrell's \\"Revolutionary Suit\\", which would serve as an inspiration for the painting Revolutionary In 1969, COBRA revised their philosophy and artistic concept to expand their concern for black liberation and civil rights on an international level. Inspired by the words of Malcolm X, \\"All black people, regardless of their land base, have the same problems, the control of their land and economics by Europeans or Euro-Americans.\\", they changed their name to AfriCOBRA: African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists. Jarrell's work had evolved to bring the focus figure to the foreground of his paintings, as seen in Coolade Lester (1970), a portrait of musician Lester Lashley. Letters make another appearance: D (down), B (black), F (fine) and Q (question). The work is described as a \\"humanistic portrayal of the genius of Africans in the creation of jazz.\\" Other works by Jarrell at the time became politically and socially charged with the aesthetics put forth by AfriCOBRA. Homage to a Giant (1970) is Jarrell's first tribute to Malcolm X. This work is used by Jarrell to speak for the black struggle against oppression and the death of student protestors fighting for that cause.Douglas, 32. Four images of Malcolm X are painted alongside those of Huey Newton, Jesse Jackson and Stokley Carmichael. \\"B\\" makes its usual appearance representing \\"blackness\\" and \\"badness\\" as well as a quote from Ossie Davis's eulogy at Malcolm's funeral. This piece, along with Coolade Lester, appeared in AFRI-COBRA's first exhibition in 1970 at the Studio Museum in Harlem: \\"AFRI-COBRA I: Ten in Search of a Nation.\\" The response to the show was one of misunderstanding by many viewers, with the result that the concepts presented were interpreted as \\"protest art.\\"Douglas, 34. \\"AFRICOBRA II\\" was held in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it traveled to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying \\"Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues.\\" Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt is attached to the canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words \\"love\\", \\"black\\", \\"nation\\", \\"time\\", \\"rest\\", \\"full of shit\\", \\"revolution\\", and \\"beautiful\\" burst out of her head on the canvas. The message \\"I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that is the way it will be,\\" travels down her chest and left arm. \\"B\\", as usual, represents \\"blackness\\" \\"bad\\" and in this painting \\"beautiful\\". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as \\"jam-packed and jelly tight.\\" Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as \\"a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans ‚Äì with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art.\\"Douglas, 40. Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. \\"B\\" appears in the painting, as well as \\"P\\"; \\"PRINCE\\" and \\"BLACK\\" which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote \\"I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results,\\" is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, \\"AFRICOBRA III\\", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell \\"together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all.\\" =Out east= Despite the offers for a position he received from Jeff Donaldson, who was running Howard University's art department, Jarrell sought to remain independent and the family moved to New York. Jarrell obtained work as a photographer in Boston, eventually choosing to accept Donaldson's offer, moving the family in time for Jarrell to teach photography classes during the fall semester. During this time \\"AFRICOBRA II\\" traveled to Howard and Jarrell exhibited Together We Will Win (1973), showing black \\"warriors,\\" children, women and workers \\"offering solutions to African people's problems,\\" and Liberation Soldiers, (1972), depicting the Black Panthers. Both works included the use of aluminum and gold foil glued to the canvas. In 1973 the final AFRICOBRA show, \\"AFRICOBRA III\\" was held. However, members still continued to meet and practice the ideals put forward by the group. African influences A mask created by the Senufo people, which would influence Jarrell's paintings and sculpture. Jarrell's studies of African art and the Senufo people appeared as a major influence during the mid-1970s. Paintings such as Prophecy, Reorientation and Navaga depict human figures that appear blended with Senufo sculptures. Navaga (1974) shows a seated woodcarver, holding a staff he works on, appearing to be made of wood himself. He wears clothing of and is surrounded by coolade colors. The face is that of Jarrell's father, manipulated into a Senufo sculptural style. In the triptych Prophecy Jarrell shows African women as Senufo figures holding sculptures of the Yoruba deity Shango, and is described as \\"jam- packed\\"Douglas, 46. with imagery, making it hard to decipher in a short time.Douglas, 44. In winter of 1977 Jarrell and Jae visited Lagos, Nigeria, as part of the American delegation to FESTAC '77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, making this the couple's first international exhibition. Other AFRICOBRA members journeyed there as well. Jarrell was influenced heavily by the bronze lost-wax castings of Benin and the woodcarving and textile arts of Oshogbo, which he believed solidified the mission of AFRI-COBRA's symbolic work through \\"intuitive space.\\" Jarrell also revisited his passion for horse racing, attending the Grand Durbar in Kaduna. On Jarrell's return, AFRI-COBRA formed their next show \\"AFRI- COBRA/Farafindugu\\"; farafindugu inferring \\"black world\\" in Mandinka. The exhibit, at the African American Museum in Philadelphia, featured two works by Jarrell created as a response to his journey to Africa: Mojo Workin and Soweto (both 1977). Mojo Workin featured a contribution from his then six-year-old eldest daughter, Jennifer.Douglas, 48. She created the drawing The Magic Lady and with Jarrell's painting it was believed that mojo was expressed when others encountered the work. This is one of the first times Jarrell uses a stained canvas. Soweto reflects the struggles of African people, specifically those suffering from the apartheid in South Africa.Douglas, 49. The painting is named after the city of Soweto, where a massacre of students occurred in 1976. Continuing to be inspired by his travels to Nigeria, Jarrell completed the work Zulu Sunday which was created to express similarities between African Americans and Nigerians through a celebration of a Sunday afternoon social affair. The painting shows Zulus dressed in ornate traditional dress, socializing on the street, unified by a sunburst.Douglas, 58. =Georgia= In 1977 the Jarrells moved from Washington, D.C. to Athens, Georgia. With his children getting older and the couple's toy company struggling to stay afloat, Jarrell became assistant professor at the University of Georgia. His position at the university assured him studio space. In 1979 he had two solo shows and participated in three AFRICOBRA exhibitions. His work continued to be socially and politically aware with paintings like Festival #1 (1978) showing brilliant Senufo figures, a work supporting South Africans at war. African imagery became more apparent in his paintings with zigzag patterns and lizards appearing, representing \\"that Africans, as the first people, have the right to speak on their own behalf,\\" as seen in Midnight Poet at 125th Street & Lenox (1979). In 1979 Jarrell received grant money to create a 52 x 31-foot mural at the East Athens Community Center. A team of art students helped Jarrell and Jae to complete the work, titled Ascension, which remains in Athens today. By the mid-1980s Jarrell was being represented by the Fay Gold Gallery in Atlanta. In 1984 the family moved to Atlanta when Jae accepted a teaching position at The Lovett School. Jarrell continued to commute to Athens to teach. The move to Atlanta provided more income for the family while allowing Jarrell to sell more work and spark relationships with potential customers, galleries and museums in the region.Douglas, 64. Jarrell became the painting professor for the University's Studies Abroad Program in 1986. For two months he lived in Cortona, Italy with Jae and his two daughters, while Wadsworth Jr. remained in Atlanta finishing high school. The opportunity allowed him to explore the country, visiting historic sites throughout Italy and the Venice Biennale.Douglas, 66. Upon his return he was promoted to full professor at the university in February 1987, but he resigned in 1988.Douglas, 68. During the 1990s Jarrell continued to explore aspects of black life in his paintings. Dudes on the Street (1991) is a depiction of black life in the city; two cartoon-like men and two women stand on the street with an expired parking meter next to them. The background features a ribs restaurant and a record shop, with coolade colors drenching the entire landscape. Robert Douglas compared the piece to Chicken Shack by Archibald Motley, stating \\"both artists have fulfilled the mission of celebrating black life.\\" Two paintings about boxing were created during this time as well: Stride of a Legend/Tribute to Papa Tall, a tribute to Muhammad Ali and textile designer Papa Tall of Senegal, and The Champion (1991) a portrayal Evander Holyfield. Horse racing revisited While in Georgia Jarrell revisited his interest in horse racing. He became interested in African American jockeys, creating the paintings The Jocks #2 (1981) and Master Tester (1981) and Homage to Isaac Murphy (1981). The Jocks #2 is a group portrait of James \\"Soup\\" Perkins, William Walker, Jimmy Winkfield and Isaac Murphy. The figures appear like a Kemetic wall painting with hints of green and light blue. At the center is Isaac Murphy, a legendary jockey of the Kentucky Derby, wearing a glowing crown. A full tribute to Murphy is seen in Homage to Isaac Murphy, a large polyptych consisting of four canvasses. Cut out leaf motifs are adhered to the canvas and applied with acrylic stains, which make the motif's appear as negative space on the surface of the painting. Zigzags are prominent, a lizard appears to represent speed, a lawn jockey, and the dates of Murphy's wins, titles and horse names are at the top. The painting is finished with a stylized portrait of Murphy and cowry shells are glued to the canvas representing the money won by Murphy during his career. Master Tester is an abstract of horse trainer Marshall Lilly, riding a horse, wearing a derby hat.Douglas, 60. In 1993 Jarrell would have a solo show, titled \\"Edge Cutters,\\" at the Kentucky Derby Museum in Lexington, Kentucky. The bricklayer's trowel and jazz tributes Jazz Giants, lithograph, 1987 In December 1982 Jarrell was commissioned by Westinghouse Electric Company to create a three-hundred-foot mural in their Athens headquarters, to boost the morale of the employees. The mural was the first time he used a bricklayer's trowel in his work, a tool introduced to him by Adger Cowans. The Apple Birds and The Return of the Apple Birds, from 1983, show his dramatic use of the trowel. The paintings were inspired by a drawing by his daughter, Jennifer, at the age of two. The Apple Birds were drawn by and talked about by Jennifer as having apple-shaped heads with stems at the top, long arms and short bodies. Zigzags, geometric shapes and layers make up the environment that the Apple Birds live in on the canvas. The trowel is used throughout to create 3-D layers and overlaps. Jarrell created many jazz tributes starting in the 1980s. Cookin' n Smokin' (1986) is a tribute to jazz musician Oscar Peterson, who is shown playing piano with a sunburst design around his head. To the left of Peterson is bass player Ray Brown. Both figures have large heads, their faces have exaggerated features similar to African masks, and are described as being \\"midpoint between naturalism and abstraction\\" by Robert Douglas. The trowel is used throughout to blend color. Jazz Giants (1987), another jazz tribute, shows Dizzy Gillespie, Harry Carney, Johnny Hodges and Cootie Williams performing. Leaf patterns and circles common in Jarrell's work are seen throughout. The trowel is used to create recognizable portraits of the musicians, with the paint on a white background appearing as if a woodcut. Priestess (1988) depicts another jazz icon, Nina Simone, who appears twice ‚Äì playing piano and singing solo, backed by a band. 1979's I Remember Bill is a memorial to Jarrell's friend guitarist Bill Harris, originally of The Clovers.Douglas, 80.Douglas, 79. Jarrell occasionally traveled with Harris, hanging his paintings behind Harris as he performed. The painting is a large mixed-media polyptych of shaped canvas, and a painted six-stringed guitar sits on the top of the work. The painting features glued on photographs of Harris and two painted portraits of the musician, surrounded by Jarrell's signature symbols, designs and patterns. Other works include: Corners of Jazz (1988), a large mural featuring Ray Charles, Lester Young, and Billie Holiday, Shon'nuf (1989), featuring Ray Charles, At the Three Deuces (1991) with Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Sam Potter, Basie at the Apollo (1992) with Count Basie's orchestra, The Empress (1992) for Bessie Smith, and Lady & Prez #2, showing Holiday and Young performing together.Douglas, 72, 75. =Sculpture= Inspired by his trip to Italy, Jarrell created the sculpture Tribute to Ovambo Bellows, a conical-shaped painted tribute to the Ovambo people, which would be the basis for a new shift in his work, towards sculpture. The new works would be categorized by their heavy spiritual nature, reflective of African culture and heritage. Hausa Space ‚Äì a Village (1993) represents the villages Jarrell visited in Nigeria. The houses that he saw were decorated with icons and symbols of spiritual and ritual meaning, painted in bright colors. These decorations are used to fight evil spirits, while Jarrell's pieces speak for peace.Douglas, 85. Many of the sculptures blend elements of African art and design; Sorcerer (1993) and Messenger of Information (1993) show his earlier influences from Senufo art and other inspirations related to the design, spirituality and people of Africa.Douglas, 89. Totem‚Äìlike sculptures began to be created in 1995. The three sculptures making up the Ensemble series (1995) each stand over five feet tall and are painted with brilliant colors, topped off with a small animal. For the first time, in Days of the Kings (1995), horse racing appears in Jarrell's sculptures. Sixteen totems serve as tributes to African Americans in horse racing, reminiscent of the designs of the Bijogo and Alberto Giacometti. Epiphany (1996) memorializes the Million Man March, held in Washington, D.C. the previous year, an event that Jarrell described as one of the most important of that century. This piece, and other works, were later exhibited at the 1996 Summer Olympics.Douglas, 94. =Reception= Dr. Stacy Morgan, association professor in the department of American Studies at the University of Alabama, describes Jarrell's work as \\"a remarkable body of vibrant, stylistically innovative and politically engaged art.\\" Awards *First prize, 1988, Atlanta Life Invitational Exhibition, Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art *Cover, 1985, Art Papers *Excellence in painting award, 1985, Southern Home Shows ExpositionDouglas, 65. *Award, 1974, District of Columbia Commission on the Arts *Artist-in-Residence, 1974, District of Columbia Public Schools Selected exhibitions =Solo exhibitions= *Edge Cutters. 1993, Kentucky Derby Museum. *Large Format. 1987, Southwest Atlanta Hospital. *Paintings and Sculptures, Wadsworth Jarrell. 1987, Albany Museum of Art. *The Power and the Glory. 1979, University of Georgia. *Going Home., 1976, Howard University. =Group exhibitions= *AFRI-COBRA: No Middle Ground. 1992, Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, Illinois. *Twelfth Annual Atlanta Life Invitational Exhibition. 1992, Herndon Plaza, Atlanta. *Vital Signs. 1991, Atlanta Contemporary Art Center. *AFRI-COBRA: The First Twenty Years. 1990, Florida A&M; University. *Horse Flesh. 1990, Kentucky Derby Museum. *Beaches Annual Exhibition. 1989, Museum of Contemporary Art Jacksonville. *Artists in Georgia 1988., 1988 Atlanta Contemporary Art Center. *The Art in Atlanta. 1988, Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. *Birmingham Biennial. 1987, Birmingham Museum of Art. *AFRICOBRA USA. 1987, Sermac Gallery, Fort-de-France, Martinique. *Ot Och In. 1986, Malm√∂ konstmuseum. *Artists in Georgia. 1985, Georgia Museum of Art. *Atlanta in France. 1985, Chapelle de la Sorbonne. *U.S.A.

After high school, Fosty moved to Bellingham, Washington where he attended Western Washington University majoring in history and journalism and graduating in 1992. During his college years he played bass guitar with the band First Step considered the 'sister band' for the Seattle-based Brotherhood, the band which included future Sunny Day Real Estate and Foo Fighters' bassist Nate Mendel. \\"I remember playing shows with him [Nate]. He told me he thought I was [a] good [bassist]. But he only practiced about 2 hours a day and I was practicing up to 12 and thinking, if I am not better than him, I must suck, so I quit playing. Little did I know at the time he was probably the best bassist in Seattle.... If it wasn't for him, I might still be playing.\\"a In 1994, Fosty wrote press releases for the Seattle Sounders FC sports information department. After leaving the Sounders, he worked in the technology industry becoming the first employee of the Internet security start-up Zendit, now Authora.a In 2003, Fosty released his first book with his brother George, \\"Splendid is the Sun: The 5,000 Year History of Hockey.\\" In 2004, Fosty released the book \\"Black Ice: The Lost History of the Colored Hockey League of the Maritimes, 1895-1925\\" which briefly entered the US Top 100, and becoming one of the highest charting hockey books in the history of American publishing. In 2012 Black Ice was praised as one of Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Top Four books. According to Oprah.com \\"this little-known story of the first professional black ice hockey players appealed to Gooding partly because he has been a regular at the rink for the past 17 years. When the slaves escaped the South, some of them went to Philly or New York, but some of them continued on to Canada, where the Indians befriended them,\\" he says. \\"As I remember the book, the Indians saw the ex- slaves as being in the same situation they were: oppressed by the white man. So they intermarried, shared food‚Äîand played. And one of the games they played was hockey. Soon they had teams with names like the Moss Backs‚Äîfor the moss on the side of a tree that shows you how to get up North to freedom. There was a league of black men playing hockey before the NHL,\\" Gooding says. \\"Amazing!\\"\\" Many believe the book credits Nova Scotia Black hockey players with being the first to develop the slap shot. But according to Fosty the slap shot cannot be attributed to anyone. \\"No one can invent basic human movement. But, if people feel the need to \\"credit\\" others with innovation by being the first to do these types of things in an organized amateur, professional, or semi- professional hockey league then the Colored Hockey League and their players deserve the credit for being the first. During this period, other leagues didn't permit the stick coming over the waist, whereas the Colored Hockey League didn't have any such rule. Because of this, they were able to be innovative without intending to be innovative\\". In January 2014, he and his brother George released a follow-up book to Black Ice called Tribes: An International Hockey History. Fosty's latest book \\"Where Brave Men Fall: The Battle of Dieppe and the Espionage War Against Hitler, 1939-1942\\" points a damning finger at American and British news organizations, including Time Magazine and Life Magazine, accusing them of leaking the Battle of Dieppe pre- raid information to the Germans resulting in the deaths, woundings, and capture of over 4,300 American, British and Canadian soldiers.

He was Wisconsin Poet Laureate for 2011-2012, having been appointed by Governor James Doyle. He also served as secretary for the Wisconsin Fellowship of Poets for six years. Early life and influences Bruce Dethlefsen was born to Frank and Patricia Dethlefsen in 1948. Bruce lived in Kansas City with his family until 1966. Frank worked as a grocer. According to Bruce, his father wanted him to attend college, but was not keen on Bruce's desire to be a poet, as he did not think it practical. Bruce recalls the early influence his mother had in encouraging creativity with words and rhythm. He says, > I watched my mother, a displaced Okie, in her house-dress dance and sing > around the kitchen. She loved to make up songs and little rhymes. The > sillier, the better. She gave me permission to mess with words, the sound of > words strung and unstrung together. E. E. Cummings also told me it‚Äôs okay to > play. Most poets I know read and were read to as children. I remember fondly > the words, the pictures, the touching, the warmth of hand and voice as my > mother read to me. Dethlefsen was aware of his poetic inclinations as a teenager but has later remarked that, ‚ÄúI wish that when I was in 7th or in 8th grade, a man would have gotten up in front of our class and read a poem that I understood and said ‚Äòit‚Äôs really ok to do this.‚Äô I think it would have added 10 years to my writing career.\\" Career and education Bruce graduated from Paseo High School in 1966. He completed his undergraduate degree in Secondary Education at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìLa Crosse, where he had initially thought he would attend on a football scholarship, but was injured before graduating from high school. Throughout college, Bruce worked in the emergency ward of the La Crosse Lutheran Hospital. He earned his master‚Äôs degree in Curriculum and Instruction from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìOshkosh. Dethlefsen credits at least two writers for his success in poetry: John Judson, an instructor at UW‚ÄìLa Crosse, and David Steingass, artist-in-residence in Wisconsin schools. Dethlefsen took a position as a school media specialist for the Nekoosa Wisconsin School District. From there, he became a public librarian, serving as director of the Montello Public Library from 1999 to 2007. During his time there, he held regular poetry readings that included open mic sessions. At these events, Dethlefsen encouraged everyone to share their own poetry. He also taught poetry workshops there where he helped people to focus and refine their style. During his time as Montello Library Director, he worked closely with the Friends of the Library to offer the once a month Poet Tree event. Since retiring, Dethlefsen has increased his attention to his writing and also stays active with a variety of artistic ventures. He sings and plays bass guitar with musician Bill Orth as the Obvious Dogs who recorded a CD with Wisconsin Poet Cathryn Cofell. Poet Laureate Dethlefsen was appointed to the position of Wisconsin Poet Laureate for 2011-2012. In an interview for the Wisconsin Eye, he says, ‚ÄúWisconsin needs an ambassador for the arts. My job will be to go out and promote poets and poetry in Wisconsin.‚Äù He intends to use his position as the State Poet Laureate to promote the writing and sharing of poetry throughout Wisconsin. He plans to encourage and support local cultural and creative talent by organizing local poetry readings in public libraries, schools and coffee houses throughout the State. =Creation and abolishment of WI Poet Laureate position = Executive Order 404, given by Governor Thompson, created the Commission in on July 31, 2000 to recommend candidates for the Poet Laureate of Wisconsin. Seven members were appointed to 4-year terms. Each of five organizations recommended one person for membership: the Council for Wisconsin Writers, the Wisconsin Fellowship of Poets, the Wisconsin Regional Writers Association, the Wisconsin Humanities Council, and the Wisconsin Arts Board. On February 4, 2011, The Wisconsin Poet Laureate Commission received a form letter from the office of Governor Scott Walker indicating that the commission would be abolished. In May, 2011, the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Art and Letters picked up the sponsorship of the Wisconsin Poet Laureate position. =Artistic inspiration= Asked how poems come to him, Dethlefsen says, ‚ÄúThey float by in the air and I catch them. If I‚Äôm not paying attention, they go on by. That‚Äôs the most important thing for poets, to pay attention. Listen, watch, regard. Artists must pay close attention.‚Äù In an interview for Quill and Parchment, he comments on his writing habits, > I write every day, the fourth thing every morning for the last twelve years > or so. Thank you, Julia Cameron, author of The Artist‚Äôs Way, for giving me > ‚Äúmorning pages‚Äù to write. I buy cheap spiral notebooks and use purple ink > from my Waterman fountain pen.

It was the subject of an initial public offering in July 2014. Facilities Spire Healthcare operates a network of 38 private hospitals and ten clinics across the UK, as well as the London Fertility Centre. Ian Paterson Spire Murrayfield Hospital, Wirral Ian Paterson, a breast surgeon who worked at Bupa hospitals in Solihull and Sutton Coldfield, latterly run by Spire Healthcare, was convicted of 17 counts of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and three counts of unlawful wounding in respect of 10 patients.Chustecka, Z. Breast Surgeon Found Guilty of 'Wounding With Intent'. Medscape. April 28, 2017 350 patients who had been treated privately at Spire clinics are pursuing civil action against him and against the company. According to Thompsons Solicitors, Spire had allowed him to operate well after 2012, when he had been suspended by the General Medical Council. Spire's statement was \\"What Mr Paterson did in our hospitals, in other private hospitals, and in the NHS absolutely should not have happened, and today justice has been done.\\" He has been jailed for 20 years and ¬£37 million allocated for compensation. Spire initiated litigation in August 2017 against Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust claiming the trust‚Äôs failure to warn it of concerns about Paterson‚Äôs conduct was negligent and that the company relied on the NHS, as the primary employer, to tell it whether doctors were competent or whether there were patient safety concerns. Spire and the NHS Spire Liverpool Hospital The company alleged in 2013 that a block contract agreed between Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the Clinical Commissioning Groups in Blackpool, and Fylde and Wyre offered a ‚Äúclear incentive‚Äù for GPs to refer patients to the foundation trust and that this was anti-competitive behaviour. The contract provided the trust with a guaranteed income regardless of the number of patients that chose to use its services. Monitor conducted an investigation and decided that there was no evidence to support the claim though they did conclude that Blackpool CCG‚Äôs plans did not ‚Äúgo far enough‚Äù to ensure patients would be offered choice, or that the right to choice would be ‚Äúpublicised and promoted‚Äù. Its NHS business grew from ¬£262 million in 2015 to ¬£293 million in 2016. 20% is directly commissioned by NHS trusts and 80% comes from patients using the NHS e-Referral Service. Income from medical insurers reduced 1.3% to ¬£429 million. Direct payments by patients increased 9% to ¬£170 million. In 2017 turnover increased 0.6% to ¬£932 million, but NHS-funded income fell 1.9% to ¬£287.8 million. The company's pre- tax profit in 2018 fell by 64% because of lower NHS income and higher costs. Awards In 2008 Spire Healthcare won the Independent Healthcare Award for Best Healthcare Outcomes and followed this in 2009 with the Nursing Practice award for their approach to infection prevention and control. In 2010, Spire won the Nursing Practice award for the second year in succession, together with the award for Excellence in Risk Management. Spire won the Innovation Award in 2011, before going on to win the Medical Practice award in 2012.

A state of Australia, it is a large South Pacific archipelago of one large main island and a range of smaller islands. The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, many small islands, and a variety of topographical and edaphic regions on the largest island, all of which promote the development of unusually concentrated biodiversity. During long periods geographically and genetically isolated, it is known for its unique flora and fauna. The region's climate is oceanic. Overview The marine fauna of the period, separate from that of the southwest Pacific, was distinguished as the \\"Maori province\\". Gondwana began its fragmentation in the middle and upper Jurassic, and the arrival of benthic invertebrate fauna is visible in fossil deposits. The Cretaceous marked the appearance of marine invertebrate fauna of southern origin. It was then that angiosperm flora such as Nothofagus and Proteaceae colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia, from South America, along the Antarctic margin of Gondwana: Antarctica, mainland Australia and Tasmania. At the beginning of the Tertiary the area moved to north to a warmer climate. This led to long periods of evolution in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given the rise and fall of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types. Flora heathland at High Shelf Camp near Mount Anne, in Southwest National Park. 60% of Tasmanian alpine flora is endemic to the state. The most ancient communities in Tasmania have an ancestry that extend back to a time when the Earth's continents were all joined as single landmass known as Pangea which existed beyond 200 million years ago. Pangea split from east to west into Laurasia, comprising North America and Eurasia, and Gondwana, the two remaining connected at Gibraltar with the Tethys Sea separating them. The presence of closely related organisms in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres cannot be accounted for by migration. The Antarctic flora is a distinct community of vascular plants which evolved millions of years ago on the supercontinent of Gondwana, and is now found on several separate areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including southern South America, southernmost Africa, New Zealand, Australia and New Caledonia. Based on the similarities in their flora, botanist Ronald Good identified a separate Antarctic Floristic Kingdom that included southern South America, New Zealand, and some southern island groups. Good identified Australia as its own floristic kingdom, and included New Guinea and New Caledonia in the Paleotropical floristic kingdom, because of the influx of tropical Eurasian flora that had mostly supplanted the Antarctic flora. Millions of years ago, Antarctica was warmer and much wetter, and supported the Antarctic flora, including forests of podocarps and southern beech. Antarctica was also part of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwanaland, which gradually broke up by continental drift starting 110 million years ago. The separation of South America from Antarctica 30-35 million years ago allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to form, which isolated Antarctica climatically and caused it to become much colder. The Antarctic flora subsequently died out in Antarctica, but is still an important component of the flora of southern Neotropic (South America) and Australasia, which were also former parts of Gondwana. Some genera that originated in Antarctic Flora are still a recognised major component of New Caledonia, Tasmania, mainland Australia, Madagascar, India, New Zealand, and southern South America. There are three species of Nothofagus in Australia. Stands of myrtle beech (Nothofagus cunninghamii) exist in the Tarkine Forest. There are also stands of this species in the Great Otway National Park, the Central Highlands, the Strzelecki Ranges and Wilsons Promontory National Park, of Victoria. Deciduous beech (Nothofagus gunnii) occurs in mountainous parts of Tasmania. Antarctic beech (Nothofagus moorei) is found in eastern NSW cool temperate rainforests and cloud forests, but does not occur in Victoria or Tasmania. Australia rafted north and became drier; the humid Antarctic flora retreated to the mainland east coast and Tasmania, while much of the rest of Australian vegetation became dominated by Acacia, Eucalyptus, Casuarina and xeric shrubs and grasses. Humans arrived in Australia 50-60,000 years ago, and used fire to reshape the vegetation of the continent. The woody plants of the Antarctic Floristic Kingdom include conifers in the families Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae and the subfamily Callitroideae of Cupressaceae, and angiosperms such as the families Proteaceae, Griseliniaceae, Cunoniaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Winteraceae, and genera like southern beech (Nothofagus) and fuchsia (Fuchsia). Many other families of flowering plants and ferns, including the tree fern Dicksonia, are characteristic of the Antarctic flora. In the past Tasmania was omitted since its plant species are more closely related to those found in the Australian Floristic Kingdom. Good noted, as had Joseph Dalton Hooker much earlier, that many plant species of Antarctica, temperate South America and New Zealand were very closely related, despite their disjunction by the vast Southern Ocean. Tasmania and New Caledonia share related species extinct in Australia mainland. Investigations of Upper Cretaceous and Early Tertiary sediments of Antarctica yield a rich assemblage of well-preserved fossil dicotyledonous angiosperm wood which provides evidence for the existence, since the Late Cretaceous, of temperate forests similar in composition to those found in present-day southern South America, New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania. It is suggested a paleobotanical habitat similar to the extant cool temperate Valdivian rainforests. Tasmania has extremely diverse vegetation, from the heavily grazed grassland of the dry Midlands to the tall evergreen eucalypt forest, alpine heathlands and large areas of cool temperate rainforests and moorlands in the rest of the state. Many flora species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of Gondwana in the Paleotropical Kingdom, 50 million years ago. Wet eucalypt forests grow mostly in the south, west and north west, the Tasman Peninsula, and higher altitude areas of north east. Dry eucalypt forests grow where there is little rainfall and droughts are common. Areas such as the east coast, midlands and north east, i.e. the Bass Strait Islands. Tasmania is home to some of the oldest trees of the world. For example, some individual Huon pines are recorded as more than 2,000 years old. A clonal stand of male Huon pines at Mount Read maintained itself by vegetative reproduction for an estimated more than 10,000 years. The tallest trees in the Southern Hemisphere, and the tallest flowering plants anywhere ( tall or more), are Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus globulus and Eucalyptus viminalis in Tasmania (mostly in the Styx Valley). Tasmania hosts endemic plant genera as well as plant genera of restricted distribution; an example of such a genus is Archeria. For millions of years in the past, these types of vegetation present in the island, covered much of the tropics of Earth. The species of Tasmania are relicts of a type of vegetation disappeared, which originally covered much of the mainland of Australia, South America, Antarctica, South Africa, North America and other lands when their climate were more humid and warm. Although humid forests of warmer climates retreated during the glaciations, they re- colonised large areas every time the climate was favourable again. Most of the humid forests are thought to have retreated and advanced during successive geological eras, and their species adapted to warm and wet gradually retreated and advanced, replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the then existing species became extinct because they could not cross the barriers posed by new oceans, mountains and deserts, but others found refuge as relict species in coastal areas and Islands. When the large landmass of the Australian continent developed a drier and harsher climate, this type of forest was reduced to those boundaries areas. Although some remnants of archaic rich flora still persisted in coastal mountains and sheltered sites, their biodiversity were reduced. In times of high sea level such as the present era, Tasmania as an island, has a climate moderated by the Southern and Pacific Oceans and maintained relatively humid and high rainfall, which has allowed these communities to persist to the present day. The ecological requirements of many of the species, are those of the laurel forest and like most of their counterpart laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate their preferred habitats. The geographical isolation and special edaphic conditions helped to preserve it too. Many members of the late Cretaceous - early Tertiary Gondwanan flora survived in Tasmania and New Caledonia's equable climate. Fauna The invertebrates provide abundant evidence of Gondwanan ancestry. Possibly the best known example is the \\"mountain shrimp\\", Anaspides tasmaniae (Anaspididae), which is very similar to Triassic (230-million-year-old) fossils. Currently, its closest relatives are found in New Zealand and South America. The Tasmanian cave spider is considered to be one of the most primitive spiders in the world, and is the only member of its family outside Chile. The vertebrates with strong Gondwanan affinities include the major family of freshwater fish Galaxiidae, the two families of frogs within Tasmania (Myobatrachidae and Hylidae) and the parrots. Echidnas and platypus evolved from ancient ancestors which inhabited Gondwana too. Close relatives of marsupials thrive in South America and fossil platypus have also been discovered in South America. The repeated lowering of sea levels during the ice ages of the Pleistocene facilitated the movement of many species more, including the five species of rodent and eight species of bat. ;Thylacine/Tasmanian tiger Photograph of a pair of captive thylacines (Tasmanian tigers) at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., circa 1906. The island of Tasmania was home to the thylacine, a marsupial which resembled a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia about 4,000 years ago because of competition by the introduced dingo. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The thylacine was the largest known carnivorous marsupial of modern times. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes (the other is the water opossum). The male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a protective sheath, protecting the male's external reproductive organs while running through thick brush. The last known animal died in captivity in 1936. Many alleged sightings have since been recorded, none of them confirmed. The mature thylacine ranged from long, plus a tail of around . The largest measured specimen was from nose to tail. Adults stood about at the shoulder and weighed . There was slight sexual dimorphism with the males being larger than females on average. ;Tasmanian devil A Tasmanian devil The Tasmanian devil is a carnivorous marsupial found on the island of Tasmania. It also occurred on mainland Australia thousands of years ago. The size of a small dog but stocky and muscular, the Tasmanian devil is characterised by black fur with white patches. It has a loud and disturbing screech-like growl, possesses a vicious temperament and is predominantly a scavenger. The Tasmanian devil survived European settlement and was considered widespread and common throughout Tasmania until recently. As with a lot of wildlife, fast vehicles on roads are a problem for Tasmanian devils, which are often killed while feeding on other road-killed animals such as wallabies. They eat everything including bone. As of 2005, the Tasmanian devil population has been reduced by up to 80% in parts of Tasmania by the devil facial tumour disease, which is gradually spreading throughout the island. It is believed the majority starved when the tumours spread to their mouths, and that the tumours are spread by fighting between devils over carcasses they feed on‚Äîtypically, fighting devils will bite one another's faces. There is no known cure for the disease, and intensive research is underway to determine its cause. There is also a captive breeding program being undertaken by the Tasmanian government to establish a disease-free, genetically diverse population of Tasmanian devils outside Tasmania. This has been relatively successful so far. ;Birds The Tasmanian nativehen. Many birds of the Australian mainland and surrounding oceans are also found in Tasmania. Tasmania has 12 endemic bird species: * 4 honeyeaters (family Meliphagidae) ‚Äì the yellow wattlebird (world's largest honeyeater) and the yellow-throated, black-headed and strong-billed honeyeaters * 3 Australo-Papuan warblers (family Acanthizidae) ‚Äì the Tasmanian thornbill, the scrubtit and the Tasmanian scrubwren * 1 pardalote (family Pardalotidae) ‚Äì the endangered forty-spotted pardalote * 1 Australo-Papuan robin (family Petroicidae) ‚Äì the dusky robin * 1 cracticine (family Artamidae) ‚Äì the black currawong * 1 parrot (family Psittaculidae) ‚Äì the green rosella * 1 rail (family Rallidae) ‚Äì the Tasmanian nativehen, Australia's only flightless land bird other than the giant ratites (emu and southern cassowary). The endemic Tasmanian emu was exterminated in the mid-19th century. The Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is a threatened endemic subspecies. ;Frogs The brown tree frog is found in Tasmania Tasmania is home to 11 species of frog. Three of these are found only in Tasmania, the Tasmanian tree frog (Litoria burrowsae), the Tasmanian froglet (Crinia tasmaniensis) and the recently discovered moss froglet (Bryobatrachus nimbus). Of the 11 species that inhabit Tasmania all are endemic to Australia. Tasmania is home to the largest breeding population of growling grass frogs (Litoria raniformis), a vulnerable species, which has declined over much of its range. ;European red fox On 20 June 2001, Tasmania formed a fox task force, now the Fox Eradication Branch, to eliminate the European red fox. Officials planned to spend up to A$50 million on an eradication campaign, which has since been reduced. No foxes have been captured, poisoned or photographed with certainty in the Island state, although four carcasses have been recovered. Of these, one was claimed to be shot, and the other three presumed road-kills. The lack of an abundance of foxes, through low population densities, and fox-poisoning campaigns, has resulted in an abundance of denial of fox presence by the Tasmanian community. Established foxes in Tasmania could devastate native mammals, livestock, ground-nesting birds and native rodents. Experts estimate there are fewer than 30 million foxes on mainland Australia, having been introduced by European settlers.Mercer, Phil (24 September 2007) 'Fox invasion fear grips Tasmania', BBC NEWS Since white settlement, about 28 native mammal species or subspecies have become extinct from the Australian mainland, the worst rate of continental extinction in the world. Red foxes are known to be a significant contributing factor to this. Mainland extinctions or near- extinctions include the eastern barred bandicoot, eastern quoll, and Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii); all still common in Tasmania. A member of the upper house, the Legislative Council member for Windermere Ivan Dean MLC has been publicly critical of the fox evidence used to obtain funding for a taxpayer funded Fox Eradication Branch of the Tasmanian D.P.I.P.W.E.. Former Tasmanian Police Commander Dean led a Police investigation into the alleged importation and release of foxes into Tasmania. The investigation did not uncover any evidence of illegal importation. He then raised the Tasmanian fox issue in the Tasmanian Parliament on 17 April 2007.Tasmanian Parliament Legislative Council Part 1- Pages 1‚Äì61 Hansard 17 April 2007 In addition to the four carcasses, over 40 independently tested fox-DNA-confirmed scats have been located across Tasmania. Through government review, foxes are now confirmed to be in Tasmania. Certain prominent Tasmanians including Dr David Obendorf have been calling for a Federal Police investigation into allegations that evidence has been planted and this is all part of an elaborate hoax to receive funding from the Commonwealth.

There are 2 differences between tmpfs and ramfs. 1) the mounted space of ramfs is theorically infinite, as ramfs will grow if needed, which can easily cause system lockup or crash for using up all available memory, or start heavy swapping to free up more memory for the ramfs. For this reason limiting the size of a ramfs area can be recommendable. 2) tmpfs is backed by the computer's swap space There are also many \\"wrappers\\" for the RAM disks for Linux as Profile-sync-daemon (psd) and many others allowing users to utilize RAM disk for desktop application speedup moving intensive IO for caches into RAM.

The current version, VSuite Ramdisk II, has been rebranded as 'Primo Ramdisk', all versions of which are chargeable.https://www.romexsoftware.com/en-us/index.html =Microsoft source code= Ramdisk.sys sample driver for Windows 2000 Microsoft Windows offers a 'demonstration' RAM disk for Windows 2000 as part of the Windows Driver Kit.

RAMDisk sample for Windows 7/8 Microsoft provides source code for a RAM disk driver for Windows 7 and 8 Native Windows also has a rough analog to tmpfs in the form of \\"temporary files\\". Files created with both FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY and FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE are held in memory and only written to disk if the system experiences high memory pressure. In this way they behave like tmpfs, except the files are written to the specified path during low memory situations, rather than to swap space. This technique is often used by servers along with TransmitFile to render content to a buffer before sending to the client. Solaris =Ramdiskadm= Ramdiskadm is a utility found in the Solaris (operating system) to dynamically add and destroy ramdisk volumes of any user defined sizes. An example of how to use ramdiskadm to add a new RAM disk in a Solaris environment is as follows: $ ramdiskadm -a ramdisk1 100m To destroy the RAM disk: $ ramdiskadm -d ramdisk1 All created RAM disks can be accessed from the \`/dev/ramdisk\` directory path and treated like any other block device; that is, accessed like a physical block device, labeled with a file system and mounted, to even used in a ZFS pool.

The extent of coastal flooding is a function of the elevation inland flood waters penetrate which is controlled by the topography of the coastal land exposed to flooding. The seawater can flood the land via from several different paths: *Direct flooding ‚Äî where the sea height exceeds the elevation of the land, often where waves have not built up a natural barrier such as a dune *Overtopping of a barrier ‚Äî the barrier may be natural or human engineered and overtopping occurs due to swell conditions during storm or high tides often on open stretches of the coast. The height of the waves exceeds the height of the barrier and water flows over the top of the barrier to flood the land behind it. Overtopping can result in high velocity flows that can erode significant amounts of the land surface which can undermine defense structures. *Breaching of a barrier ‚Äî again the barrier may be natural (sand dune) or human engineered (sea wall), and breaching occurs on open coasts exposed to large waves. Breaching is where the barrier is broken down or destroyed by waves allowing the seawater to extend inland and flood the areas. Coastal flooding is largely a natural event, however human influence on the coastal environment can exacerbate coastal flooding. Extraction of water from groundwater reservoirs in the coastal zone can enhance subsidence of the land increasing the risk of flooding. Engineered protection structures along the coast such as sea walls alter the natural processes of the beach, often leading to erosion on adjacent stretches of the coast which also increases the risk of flooding.  Causes  Coastal flooding can result from a variety of different causes including storm surges created by storms like hurricanes and tropical cyclones, rising sea levels due to climate change and by tsunamis. = Storms and storm surges = Storms, including hurricanes and tropical cyclones, can cause flooding through storm surges which are waves significantly larger than normal. If a storm event coincides with the high astronomical tide, extensive flooding can occur. Storm surges involve three processes: # wind setup # barometric setup # wave setup Winds blowing in an onshore direction (from the sea towards the land) can cause the water to 'pile up' against the coast; this is known as wind setup. Low atmospheric pressure is associated with storm systems and this tends to increase the surface sea level; this is barometric setup. Finally increased wave breaking height results in a higher water level in the surf zone, which is wave setup. These three processes interact to create waves that can overtop natural and engineered coastal protection structures thus penetrating seawater further inland than normal. = Sea level rise = Major cities threatened by sea level rise. The cities indicated are under threat of even a small sea level rise (of 1.6 foot/49 cm) compared to the level in 2010. Even moderate projections indicate that such a rise will have occurred by 2060.:File:Projections of global mean sea level rise by Parris et al. (2012).pngSea level rise chart The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimate global mean sea-level rise from 1990 to 2100 to be between nine and eighty eight centimetres. It is also predicted that with climate change there will be an increase in the intensity and frequency of storm events such as hurricanes. This suggests that coastal flooding from storm surges will become more frequent with sea level rise. A rise in sea level alone threatens increased levels of flooding and permanent inundation of low- lying land as sea level simply may exceed the land elevation. This therefore indicates that coastal flooding associated with sea level rise will become a significant issue into the next 100 years especially as human populations continue to grow and occupy the coastal zone. = Tsunami = Coastal areas can be significantly flooded as the result of tsunami waves which propagate through the ocean as the result of the displacement of a significant body of water through earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions and glacier calvings. There is also evidence to suggest that significant tsunami have been caused in the past by meteor impact into the ocean. Tsunami waves are so destructive due to the velocity of the approaching waves, the height of the waves when they reach land and the debris the water entrains as it flows over land can cause further damage.  Mitigation  It has been said that one way to prevent significant flooding of coastal areas now and into the future is by reducing global sea level rise. This could be minimised by further reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, even if significant emission decreases are achieved, there is already a substantial commitment to sea level rise into the future. International climate change policies like the Kyoto Protocol are seeking to mitigate the future effects of climate change, including sea level rise. In addition, more immediate measures of engineered and natural defences are put in place to prevent coastal flooding. = Engineered defences = (Figure 1) Groynes are engineered structures that aim to prevent erosion of the beach front There are a variety of ways in which humans are trying to prevent the flooding of coastal environments, typically through so-called hard engineering structures such as seawalls and levees. That armouring of the coast is typical to protect towns and cities which have developed right up to the beachfront. Enhancing depositional processes along the coast can also help prevent coastal flooding. Structures such as groynes (Figure 1), breakwaters and artificial headlands promote the deposition of sediment on the beach thus helping to buffer against storm waves and surges as the wave energy is spent on moving the sediments in the beach than on moving water inland. = Natural defences = (Figure 2) Mangroves are one of the coasts natural defense systems against storm surges and flooding. Their high biomass both above and below the water can help dissipate wave energy. The coast does provide natural protective structures to guard against coastal flooding. These include physical features like gravel bars and sand dune systems, but also ecosystems such as salt marshes and mangrove forests (Figure 2) have a buffering function. Mangroves and wetlands are often considered to provide significant protection against storm waves, tsunamis and shoreline erosion through their ability to attenuate wave energy. To protect the coastal zone from flooding, the natural defenses should, therefore, be protected and maintained.  Responses  As coastal flooding is typically a natural process, it is inherently difficult to prevent flood occurrence. If human systems are affected by flooding, an adaption to how that system operates on the coast through behavioral and institutional changes is required, these changes are the so-called non-structural mechanisms of coastal flooding response. Building regulations, coastal hazard zoning, urban development planning, spreading the risk through insurance and enhancing public awareness are some ways of achieving this. Adapting to the risk of flood occurrence, can be the best option if the cost of building defense structures outweighs any benefits or if the natural processes in that stretch of coastline add to its natural character and attractiveness. A more extreme and often difficult to accept response to coastal flooding is abandoning the area (also known as managed retreat) prone to flooding. This however raises issues for where the people and infrastructure affected would go and what sort of compensation should/could be paid.  Social and economic impacts  The coastal zone (the area both within 100 kilometres distance of the coast and 100 metres elevation of sea level) is home to a large and growing proportion of the global population. Over 50 percent of the global population and 65 percent of cities with populations over five million people are in the coastal zone. In addition to the significant number of people at risk of coastal flooding, these coastal urban centres are producing a considerable amount of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP). People's lives, homes, businesses and city infrastructure like roads, railways and industrial plants are all at risk of coastal flooding with massive potential social and economic costs. The recent earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia in 2004 and in Japan in March 2011 clearly illustrate the devastation coastal flooding can produce. Indirect economic costs can be incurred if economically important sandy beaches are eroded away resulting in a loss of tourism in areas dependent on the attractiveness of those beaches.  Environmental impacts  Coastal flooding can result in a wide variety of environmental impacts on different spatial and temporal scales. Flooding can destroy coastal habitats such as coastal wetlands and estuaries and can erode dune systems. These places are characterised by their high biological diversity therefore coastal flooding can cause significant biodiversity loss and potentially species extinctions. In addition to this, these coastal features are the coasts natural buffering system against storm waves; consistent coastal flooding and sea level rise can cause this natural protection to be reduced allowing waves to penetrate greater distances inland exacerbating erosion and furthering coastal flooding. Prolonged inundation of seawater after flooding can also cause salination of agriculturally productive soils thus resulting in a loss of productivity for long periods of time. Food crops and forests can be completely killed off by salination of soils or wiped out by the movement of flood waters. Coastal freshwater bodies including lakes, lagoons and coastal freshwater aquifers can also be affected by saltwater intrusion. This can destroy these water bodies as habitats for freshwater organisms and sources of drinking water for towns and cities.  Examples  (Figure 3.) The Thames Barrier provides flood control for London, U.K. Examples of existing coastal flooding issues include: = London and the Thames Barrier= The Thames Barrier (Fig. 3) is one of the world's largest flood barriers and serves to protect London from flooding during exceptionally high tides and storm surges. The Barrier can be lifted at high tide to prevent sea waters flooding London and can be lowered to release stormwater runoff from the Thames catchment (for more information see Thames Barrier) (Figure 4.) Significant flooding in New Orleans as a result of Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the city's flood protection systems = South Canterbury Plains in New Zealand = Flooding of this low-lying coastal zone can result in prolonged inundation, which can affect the productivity of the affected pastoral agriculture for several years. = Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans = Hurricane Katrina made landfall as a category 3 cyclone on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale, indicating that it had become an only moderate level storm. However the catastrophic damage caused by the extensive flooding (Fig. 4) was the result of the highest recorded storm surges in North America. For several days prior to landfall of Katrina, wave set up was generated by the persistent winds of the cyclonic rotation of the system. This prolonged wave set up coupled with the very low central pressure level meant massive storm surges were generated. Storm surges overtopped and breached the levees and flood walls intended to protect the city from inundation. Unfortunately New Orleans is inherently prone to coastal flooding for a number of factors. Firstly, much of New Orleans is below sea level and is bordered by the Mississippi River therefore protection against flooding from both the sea and the river has become dependent on engineered structures. Land use change and modification to natural systems in the Mississippi River have rendered the natural defenses for the city less effective. Wetland loss has been calculated to be around since 1930. This is a significant amount as four miles of wetland are estimated to reduce the height of a storm surge by one foot (30 centimeters). (Figure 5.) A village near the coast of Sumatra lies in ruin on 2 January 2005 after the devastating tsunami that struck on Boxing Day 2004 = Indonesia and Japan post-earthquake and tsunamis = An earthquake of approximately magnitude 9.0 struck off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia causing the propagation of a massive tsunami throughout the Indian Ocean. This tsunami caused significant loss of human life, an estimate of 280,000 ‚Äì 300,000 people has been reported and caused extensive damage to villages, towns, and cities (Fig. 5) and to the physical environment. The natural structures and habitats destroyed or damaged included coral reefs, mangroves, beaches, and seagrass beds. The more recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2012 also clearly illustrates the destructive power of tsunamis and the turmoil of coastal flooding.

It is part of the route of InterCity services between Karlsruhe and Nuremberg and is single-track and electrified. The line follows the course of the upper Jagst river, which it is named after. The prefix distinguishes it from the Lower Jagst Railway (Unteren Jagstbahn), which is the Bad Friedrichshall‚ÄìOsterburken section of the modern Franconia Railway (Frankenbahn). History  In 1863 the line from Aalen to N√∂rdlingen was completed; this line is now called the Ries Railway (Riesbahn). Since the construction of the route to Crailsheim was already planned at that time, Goldsh√∂fe station was built as a junction station (Trennungsbahnhof, literally ‚Äúseparation station‚Äù). The two lines share an entrance building, which lies between the two lines. The line from Goldsh√∂fe to Crailsheim opened on 15 November 1866. In 1870, there were suggestions of building a connection from Ellwangen to Dinkelsb√ºhl and continuing to Nuremberg. However, these plans were rejected for the much shorter route via Crailsheim and Ansbach (the Nuremberg‚ÄìCrailsheim railway). In 1939, it was decided to duplicate the single-track Upper Jagst line, but these plans came to nothing due to the outbreak of World War II. The operation of electric trains on the Upper Jagst line was possible from 14 May 1985 and regular electrical operation commenced at the timetable change on 2 June 1985. Operations  The line is electrified and single-track, and completely equipped with H/V (Haupt-/Vorsignal-System) colour light signals. Only Goldsh√∂fe station still has semaphore signals, operated by two mechanical signal boxes. The maximum speed limit on the line is 120 km/h, although it is only reached on the southern section. The regional plan of Ostw√ºrttemberg envisages the duplication of the line. There are passing loops in Jagstheim (not for passenger trains), Jagstzell and Ellwangen. In the course of electrification in 1985 the sidings in Stimpfach and Schwabsberg were removed. All sidings for freight transport in Ellwangen were removed in September 2003. Some stations do not conform to modern standards. Thus, the height of the platforms in Ellwangen and Goldsh√∂fe are below the minimum standard of 38 cm above rail level. The central platforms of the stations are only reached by crossing the tracks on the flat. Currently (winter of 2010-2011) the platform in Ellwangen is being renovated. In Schrezheim, a level crossing will be replaced by an underpass. In Ellwangen-Rindelbach an existing underpass will be upgraded. These will replace two level crossings, which will be closed. In the summer of 2010, the platforms in Jagstzell were modernised. For some time there have been efforts to reactivate Jagstheim station, which is no longer used for passengers, and Stimpfach station, which is disused. The city of Ellwangen is also pressing for the construction of a station at Ellwangen-Rindelbach. In November 2009, the Ostw√ºrttemberg Region commissioned a feasibility study on the duplication of the line and the establishment of additional stations between Ellwangen and Crailsheim. =Regional services = Regional-Express services run hourly on the Ulm‚ÄìCrailsheim route from Ulm to Ellwangen, with every second train extended to Crailsheim. The journey time from Aalen to Crailsheim is 43 minutes. In the opposite direction trains take 40 minutes, because of the limited passing opportunities, which mostly occur in Jagstzell. The main vehicles used for regional services on the line are class 650 Regio- Shuttles. Because of cutbacks in public transport in Baden W√ºrttemberg, the existing schedule has become thinner. Ellwangen station Goldsh√∂fe station was originally built not to serve the location, but as a junction station on the lines from Aalen to N√∂rdlingen and to Crailsheim. Today many people from the nearby municipalities of H√ºttlingen and Buch (in the municipality of Rainau) use Goldsh√∂fe station. =Long distance = From 1991 to 2002 the Upper Jagst Railway was served by InterRegio services on the Stuttgart‚ÄìAalen‚ÄìCrailsheim‚ÄìNuremberg route. Since 2002, InterCity trains on line 61 run on the (Basel SBB‚Äì) Karlsruhe‚ÄìPforzheim‚ÄìStuttgart‚ÄìAalen‚ÄìNuremberg route at two-hour intervals. Some freight trains run on the Upper Jagst Railway between Stuttgart and Nuremberg.

It is a branch of econophysics.  Background on instrument pricing  Finance theory is heavily based on financial instrument pricing such as stock option pricing. Many of the problems facing the finance community have no known analytical solution. As a result, numerical methods and computer simulations for solving these problems have proliferated. This research area is known as computational finance. Many computational finance problems have a high degree of computational complexity and are slow to converge to a solution on classical computers. In particular, when it comes to option pricing, there is additional complexity resulting from the need to respond to quickly changing markets. For example, in order to take advantage of inaccurately priced stock options, the computation must complete before the next change in the almost continuously changing stock market. As a result, the finance community is always looking for ways to overcome the resulting performance issues that arise when pricing options. This has led to research that applies alternative computing techniques to finance.  Background on quantum finance  One of these alternatives is quantum computing. Just as physics models have evolved from classical to quantum, so has computing. Quantum computers have been shown to outperform classical computers when it comes to simulating quantum mechanics as well as for several other algorithms such as Shor's algorithm for factorization and Grover's algorithm for quantum search, making them an attractive area to research for solving computational finance problems. = Quantum continuous model = Most quantum option pricing research typically focuses on the quantization of the classical Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation from the perspective of continuous equations like the Schr√∂dinger equation. Haven builds on the work of Chen and others, but considers the market from the perspective of the Schr√∂dinger equation. The key message in Haven's work is that the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation is really a special case of the Schr√∂dinger equation where markets are assumed to be efficient. The Schr√∂dinger-based equation that Haven derives has a parameter ƒß (not to be confused with the complex conjugate of h) that represents the amount of arbitrage that is present in the market resulting from a variety of sources including non-infinitely fast price changes, non- infinitely fast information dissemination and unequal wealth among traders. Haven argues that by setting this value appropriately, a more accurate option price can be derived, because in reality, markets are not truly efficient. This is one of the reasons why it is possible that a quantum option pricing model could be more accurate than a classical one. Baaquie has published many papers on quantum finance and even written a book that brings many of them together. Core to Baaquie's research and others like Matacz are Feynman's path integrals. Baaquie applies path integrals to several exotic options and presents analytical results comparing his results to the results of Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation showing that they are very similar. Piotrowski et al. take a different approach by changing the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton assumption regarding the behavior of the stock underlying the option. Instead of assuming it follows a Wiener‚ÄìBachelier process, they assume that it follows an Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process. With this new assumption in place, they derive a quantum finance model as well as a European call option formula. Other models such as Hull‚ÄìWhite and Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss have successfully used the same approach in the classical setting with interest rate derivatives. Khrennikov builds on the work of Haven and others and further bolsters the idea that the market efficiency assumption made by the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation may not be appropriate. To support this idea, Khrennikov builds on a framework of contextual probabilities using agents as a way of overcoming criticism of applying quantum theory to finance. Accardi and Boukas again quantize the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton equation, but in this case, they also consider the underlying stock to have both Brownian and Poisson processes. = Quantum binomial model = Chen published a paper in 2001, where he presents a quantum binomial options pricing model or simply abbreviated as the quantum binomial model. Metaphorically speaking, Chen's quantum binomial options pricing model (referred to hereafter as the quantum binomial model) is to existing quantum finance models what the Cox‚ÄìRoss‚ÄìRubinstein classical binomial options pricing model was to the Black‚ÄìScholes‚ÄìMerton model: a discretized and simpler version of the same result. These simplifications make the respective theories not only easier to analyze but also easier to implement on a computer. = Multi-step quantum binomial model = In the multi-step model the quantum pricing formula is: C_0^N=mathrm{tr}[(bigotimes_{j=1}^{N}rho_j){[S_N-K]}^+] which is the equivalent of the Cox‚ÄìRoss‚ÄìRubinstein binomial options pricing model formula as follows: C_0^N=(1+r)^{-N}sum_{n=0}^{N}frac{N!}{n!(N-n)!}q^n{(1-q)}^{N-n} {[S_0{(1+b)}^n{(1+a)}^{N-n}-K]}^+ This shows that assuming stocks behave according to Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann classical statistics, the quantum binomial model does indeed collapse to the classical binomial model. Quantum volatility is as follows as per Meyer: sigma=frac{ln{(1+x_0+sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2})}}{sqrt{1/t}}  Bose‚ÄìEinstein assumption  Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann statistics can be replaced by the quantum Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics resulting in the following option price formula: C_0^N=(1+r)^{-N}sum_{n=0}^{N}left(frac{q^n{(1-q)}^{N-n}}{sum_{k=0}^{N}q^k{(1-q)}^{N-k}}right){[S_0{(1+b)}^n{(1+a)}^{N-n}-K]}^+ The Bose‚ÄìEinstein equation will produce option prices that will differ from those produced by the Cox‚ÄìRoss‚ÄìRubinstein option pricing formula in certain circumstances. This is because the stock is being treated like a quantum boson particle instead of a classical particle.  Quantum algorithm for the pricing of derivatives  Rebentrost showed in 2018 that an algorithm exists for quantum computers capable of pricing financial derivatives with a square root advantage over classical methods. This development marks a shift from using quantum mechanics to gain insight into computational finance, to using quantum systems- quantum computers, to perform those calculations.

Prior to his arrest he was the editor of Alma-Ata Info. Personal life Yesergepov is married to Raushan Yesergepova. Career Yesergepov founded Alma-Ata Info in 2005. In 2006, the newspaper was charged under Administrative Code Article 342 for alleged violations of the law on mass media; namely, the Almaty City Council claimed that the newspaper had changed its thematic focus but failed to register the change with the government. The newspaper faced a maximum fine of T206,000 (roughly US$1600). Yesergepov believed the real reason for the charges was retaliation for articles criticising the authorities. In November 2008, Yesergepov published a piece entitled \\"Who Rules the Country: President or National Security Committee?\\", featuring private correspondence from the chief of the Jambyl Regional Department of the National Security Committee. The NSC then listed the document as classified information, and ordered Yesergepov to reveal his sources. Around the same time, Yesergepov suffered an infarction and went to obtain medical care; due to his hospitalisation, he did not attend an interrogation as ordered, even after his release from hospital. Arrest and imprisonment On 6 January 2009, officers of the NSC's Jambyl department detained Yesergepov on charges of \\"unlawful compilation and proliferation of information containing state secrets\\" and \\"abuse of position\\". The initial charges were brought under Penal Code Article 172 Part 2, carrying a maximum sentence of three years. However, the Taraz District Court #2 then decided to charge Yesergepov under Part 4 of the same article instead, meaning that he could face up to eight years in prison. In August 2009 he was sentenced to three years in prison; the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to investigate the legality of the decision. Yesergepov's case returned to the Taraz court, which upheld the original sentence in October 2009. Yesergepov was imprisoned at Taraz Standard Regime Penal Colony #158/2. He applied for parole in January 2010; when that request was denied, he requested transfer to a lesser-security colony-settlement instead, which was also refused. On 30 June 2010, he announced his intention to go on hunger strike. His hunger strike lasted until 11 July. Two days later, his next request for parole was also denied. At the end of that month, his wife delivered an appeal from her husband to Viktoriya Tiuneleva of the NGO Kazakhstani Bureau for Human Rights, to be forwarded to the United Nations Human Rights Council. In September 2010, another application of Yesergepov's for transfer to a colony- settlement was denied. Response to imprisonment The case against Yesergepov led to condemnation by Kazakhstani opposition party Azat, which called his arrest an attempt to intimidate journalists. Local newspaper Adil Soz stated that Yesergepov did not receive a public trial, violating Criminal Procedural Code Article 17. A number of international organisations also condemned the matter. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to which Kazakhstan had submitted a bid for chairmanship, stated that Yesergepov's imprisonment \\"violated international standards and Kazakhstan's commitments on media freedom\\", and sent a letter of protest to the Kazakhstani government. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists accused Kazakhstan's government of undermining the OSCE through human rights violation at home; Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Ilyas Omarov stated in response that no OSCE member state had complained to his ministry over the matter, and that Kazakhstan had a \\"healthy media environment\\" run primarily by private companies rather than state bodies.

Revering the king as god incarnated on earth is the concept of devaraja. \\"DevarƒÅja\\" was the religious order of the \\"god-king\\", or deified monarch in medieval Southeast Asia. The devarƒÅja order grew out of both Sanatana Dharma and separate local traditions depending on the area. It taught that the king was a divine universal ruler, a manifestation of Shri Bhagawan (often attributed to Shiva or Vishnu). The concept viewed the monarch to possess transcendental quality, the king as the living god on earth. The concept is closely related to the Bharati concept of Chakravartin (universal monarch). In politics, it is viewed as the divine justification of a king's rule. The concept was institutionalized and gained its elaborate manifestations in ancient Java and Kambujadesha, where monuments such as Prambanan and Angkor Wat were erected to celebrate the king's divine rule on earth. The devaraja concept of divine right of kings was adopted by the indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia though Indian Hindu Brahmins scholars deployed in courts. It was first adopted by Javanese kings and through them by various Malay kingdoms, then by the Khmer empire, and subsequently by the Thai monarches.  Etymology and evolution  In Sanskrit the Hindu origin term deva-raja could have different meanings such as \\"god-king\\" or \\"king of the gods\\". In Hindu pantheon the title of king of gods is often attributed to Shiva, sometimes Vishnu, or previously Indra. Thus the mortal kingdom on earth mirrored the celestial kingdom of gods, the concept regarded the king as the living god on earth. It is also from influences in Sanatana Dharma and separate local traditions. Indian origin religions (also called Dharmic or Indic religions) originated in the Indian subcontinent; namely Hinduism, and its later offshoots such as Jainism, Buddhism, and Sikhism.Adams, C. J., Classification of religions: Geographical, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2007. Accessed: 15 July 2010 With ancient roots in the Indus Valley Civilisation, the documented history of Indian origin religions begin with the historical Vedic religion during the Vedic period which lasted from 1750 BCE to 500 BCE., p. 33 Various reform movements in Hinduism led to development of offshoots of Hinduism such as Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism., p=259-60, pp=xx‚Äìxxiv As evidence from the history of Indian influence on Southeast Asia, the Southeast Asian kingdoms adopted Indian Sanskrit terms and Hindu-Buddhist concepts through the process off indianisation and sanskritization, the evolution and spread of the concept of deveraja is once such example. Devaraja concept evolved from the earlier Indian concept of \\"Chakravarti\\". Chakravarti refers to an ideal universal ruler, especially in the sense of an imperial ruler of the entire Indian sub- continent (as in the case of the Maurya Empire).Rosenfield, 175 The first references to a Chakravala Chakravartin appear in monuments from the time of the early Maurya Empire, in the 4th to 3rd century BCE, in reference to Chandragupta Maurya and his grandson Ashoka. In Hinduism, the term generally denotes a powerful ruler whose dominion extended to the entire earth. In Buddhist kingship and Jainism, the term generally applies to temporal as well as spiritual kingship and leadership. In Buddhism, the Chakravarti came to be considered the secular counterpart of a Buddha. Ashoka was an emperor of the Maurya empire, who ruled almost all of the Indian subcontinent from to 232 BCE. For the spread of Buddhism, he sent buddhist missions to 9 destinations, including Tibet and China, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia., pp=143* , pp=10-12, pp=32 Establishment of these early era links led to the ongoing transmission of Indian concepts to Southeast Asia.  Devaraja concept of \\"the divine ruler\\"  = Purpose = The Devaraja concept has been established through rituals and institutionalized within the Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia. It enables the monarch to claim the divine authority which could be used on ensuring political legitimacy, managing social order, economic and religious aspects. In political aspects, it strengthens the justification of the king and the ruling dynasty as the rightful ruler of the land. It also used to maintain social order, exalting the king as living god definitely demands the utmost service and devotion of his people. Introducing the Indian caste system also defining social class, occupations, as well as the way of life of their people. The Devaraja religious order also enabled the king to embark on large scale public works and grand projects, by mobilizing their people to create and maintain elaborate hydraulic irrigation system to support large scale rice agriculture or to construct imposing grand monuments and temples in the king's honor. The example of this grand projects are Borobudur, Prambanan, also temples and barays in Angkor. = Ritual = Example of the Devaraja religious order ‚Äî such as demonstrated by Jayavarman II ‚Äî associate the king with the Hindu deity Sri Shiva, whose divine essence was physically embodied by the linga (or lingam), a phallic idol housed in a mountain temple. The king was deified in an elaborate and mystical ceremony, requiring a high priest, in which the divine essence of kingship was conferred on the ruler through the agency of the linga. The safeguarding of the linga became bound up with the security of the kingdom, and the great temple architecture of the Khmer period attests to the importance attached to the belief.  Adoption of the devaraja concept  = Indian Subcontinent =  Tamil kings  In Dravidian culture, before Brahmanism and especially during the Sangam period, emperors were known as ‡Æá‡Æ±‡Øà‡ÆØ‡Æ∞‡Øç (Iraiyer), or \\"those who spill\\", and kings were called ‡Æï‡Øã (Ko) or ‡Æï‡Øã‡Æ©‡Øç (Kon). During this time, the distinction between kingship and godhood had not yet occurred, as the caste system had not yet been introduced. Even in Modern Tamil, the word for temple is '‡Æï‡Øã‡ÆØ‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Øç', meaning \\"king's house\\". Kings were understood to be the \\"agents of God\\", as they protected the world like God did. This may well have been continued post- Brahminism in Tamilakam, as the famous Thiruvalangadu inscription states: = Indianized polities in Southeast Asia = Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Southeast Asia deployed the Indian Hindu Brahmins scholars in their courts. Under the influence of the Brahmin scholars these kingdoms adopted the concept of deveraja. It was first adopted by the Indianised Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Java. Khmer empire which ruled Cambodia and Vietnam and other parts of the nearby present day nations adopted it from the Javanese kings. Eventually, Thai kings adopted the concept from the nearby Khmer empire.  Javanese kingdoms  Prambanan Trimurti temple, according to Shivagrha inscription (856 CE) dedicated for the highest god Siwa Mahadewa The concept of devaraja or God King was the ancient Cambodian state religion, but it probably originated in Java where the Hindu influence first reached Southeast Asia. Circa 8th century, Sailendras allegedly ruled over Java, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and parts of Cambodia. In ancient Java, since Sailendra dynasty. The devaraja concept is believed to be introduced to Java in 732, when king Sanjaya installed a linga to consecrate a new Mataram Dynasty, as stated in Canggal inscription, thus the king seek Shiva's protection of his rule. Even older Tarumanagara kingdom, the state religion regarded the king as god incarnated on earth. The Tarumanagara fifth century CE Ciaruteun inscription, inscribed with king's sole print, regarded King Purnawarman as incarnation of Vishnu on earth. The Kebon Kopi I inscription, also called Telapak Gajah stone, with an inscription and the engraving of two large elephant footprints, associated king's elephant ride as Airavata (elephant ride of God Indra), thus associated the king also with Indra. In Medang kingdom in Central Java, it is customary to erect candi (temple) to honor and sent the soul of a dead king. The image of god inside the garbhagriha (central chamber) of the temple often portrayed the deceased king as a god, as the soul of the dead king finally united with the revered god in svargaloka. Some archaeologists propose that the statue of Shiva in the garbhagriha of Prambanan main temple was modelled after King Balitung, serving as a depiction of his posthumous deified self.Soetarno, Drs. R. second edition (2002). \\"Aneka Candi Kuno di Indonesia\\" (Ancient Temples in Indonesia), pp. 16. Dahara Prize. Semarang. . It is suggested that the concept was the fusion of Hinduism with native Austronesian ancestor worship. The 11th century great king Airlangga of Kahuripan in East Java, was deified posthumously as Vishnu in Belahan temple. In Java, the tradition of divine king continued well to Kediri, Singhasari, and Majapahit kingdom in the 15th century. After the coming of Islam in the archipelago and the fall of Majapahit, the concept of God-King were most likely ceased to exist in Java, since Islam rejects the concept of divinity in mortal human being. Yet the concept survived in traditional Javanese mysticism of Kejawen as wahyu, suggesting that every king and rulers in Java was bestowed wahyu, a divine authority and mandate from God. A heavenly mandate that could be revoked and transferred by God, to explain the change of dynasty in Java during Demak, Mataram Sultanate era, well to the succession of the president of Indonesia.  Cambodia and Khmer empire  The concept of Devaraja enabled Khmer kings to embark on grand-scale project, such as to build Angkor Wat. In ancient Cambodia, devarƒÅja is recognized as the state's institutionalized religion. The Cambodian the concept of the \\"god-king\\" is believed to be established early in the 9th century by Jayavarman II, founder of the Khmer empire of Angkor, with the brahmin scholar Sivakaivalya as his first chief priest at Mahendraparvata. For centuries, the concept provided the religious basis of the royal authority of the Khmer kings. In a Khmer context the term was used in the latter sense as \\"god-king\\", but occurs only in the Sanskrit portion of the inscription K. 235 from Sdok Kak Thom / Sdok KƒÉk Tho·πÉ (in modern Thailand) dated 8 February 1053 CE, referring to the Khmer term kamrate·πÖ jagat ta rƒÅja (\\"Lord of the Universe who is King\\") describing the protective deity of the Khmer Empire, a distinctly Khmer deity, which was mentioned before in the inscription K. 682 of Chok Gargyar (K√≤·∏• Ker) dated 921/22 CE.Claude Jacques, \\"The Kamrate·πÖ Jagat in ancient Cambodia\\", Indus Valley to Mekong Delta. Explorations in Epigraphy; ed. by Noboru Karashima, Madras: New Era Publications, 1985, pp. 269-286 In the Sdok KƒÉk Tho·πÉ inscription a member of a brahmin family claimed that his ancestors since the time of Jayavarman II (), who established around 800 CE by marriage to the daughter of a local king in the Angkor region a small realm which became at the end of the 9th century the famous Khmer Empire, were responsible for the concept of the DevarƒÅja (kamrate·πÖ jagat ta rƒÅja). Historians formerly dated his reign as running from 802 CE to 850 CE, but these dates are of very late origin (11th century) and without any historical basis. Some scholarssee for example Michael Vickery, Society, Economics, and Politics in Pre-Angkor Cambodia: The 7th-8th Centuries, Tokyo: The Centre for East Asian Cultural Studies for Unesco, The Toyo Bunko, 1998, p. 396: \\"Not only was Jayavarman II from the South; more than any other known king, he had particularly close links with VyƒÅdhapura. This place is recorded in only one pre-Angkor inscription, K. 109/655 [exactly: 10th February 656], but in 16 Angkor-period texts, the last dated 1069 [K. 449 from P√†lh√†l, dated Sunday, 3rd May 1069] ‚Ä¶ Two of them, K. 425/968 and K. 449/1069, are explicit records of Jayavarman II taking people from VyƒÅdhapura to settle in Battambang‚Äù now have tried to identify Jayavarman II with Jayavarman Ibis who is known from his inscriptions from Pr√°·∏• Th√£t Pr√°·∏• Srƒïi south of Kompo·πÖ ƒå√†·πÉ (K. 103, dated 20 April 770)Inscriptions du Cambodge, Vol. V, Paris 1953, pp. 33-34 and from Lob≈è‚Äôk Sr√≥t in the vicinity of Kraƒç√®·∏• close to the ancient town of ≈öambhupura (K. 134, dated 781 CEInscriptions du Cambodge, Vol. II, Hanoi 1942, pp. 92-95). The Sdok KƒÉk Tho·πÉ inscription incised c. 250 years after the events (of which their historicity is doubtful) recounts that on the top of the Kulen Hills, Jayavarman II instructed a brahmin priest named Hira·πáyadƒÅman to conduct a religious ritual known as the concept of the devarƒÅja () which placed him as a cakravartin, universal monarch, a title never heard of before in Cambodia. Coedes states, \\"...in southern India, Mount Mahendra was considered the residence of Siva as king of all gods (devaraja), including Indra Devaraja, and as sovereign of the country where the mountain stands. The ritual of the Devaraja established by the brahmin Hiranydama was based on four texts - Vinasikha, Nayottara, Sammoha, and Siraccheda...the four faces of Tumburu. These Tantras \\"were supposed to have been uttered by the four mouths of Siva represented by the gandharva Tumburu.\\" He goes on to state, \\"In the Indianized kingdoms of Southeast Asia, the Hindu cults...eventually became royal cults. The essence of royalty...was supposed to reside in a linga...obtained from Siva through a brahmin who delivered it to the king...the communion between the king and the god through the medium of a priest took place on the sacred mountain.\\" Khmer emperor Jayavarman II is widely regarded as the king that set the foundation of the Angkor period in Cambodian history, beginning with the grandiose consecration ritual conducted by Jayavarman II (reign 790-835) in 802 on sacred Mount Mahendraparvata, now known as Phnom Kulen, to celebrate the independence of Kambuja from Javanese dominion (presumably the \\"neighboring Chams\\", or chvea). At that ceremony Prince Jayavarman II was proclaimed a universal monarch (Kamraten jagad ta Raja in Cambodian) or God King (Deva Raja in Sanskrit).Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., According to some sources, Jayavarman II had resided for some time in Java during the reign of Sailendras, or \\"The Lords of Mountains\\", hence the concept of Devaraja or God King was ostensibly imported from Java. At that time, Sailendras allegedly ruled over Java, Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula and parts of Cambodia. An inscription from the Sdok Kak Thom temple recounts that at Mahendraparvata, Jayavarman II took part in a ritual by the Brahman Hiranyadama, and his chief priest Lord Sivakaivalya, known as devaraja () which placed him as a chakravartin, Lord of the Universe. Today, the tradition of public reverence to the King of Cambodia is said to be the continuation of this ancient concept of devaraja, and is mistakenly said of the King of Thailand. Thailand  This concept of \\"\\" ( (or \\"divine king\\") was adopted by the Thai kings from the ancient Khmer tradition of devaraja followed in the region, and the Hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the Thai king. The concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation (avatar) of the god Vishnu and that he was a Bodhisattva (enlightened one), therefore basing his power on his religious power, his moral power, and his purity of blood. Brahmins took charge in the royal coronation. The king was treated as a reincarnation of Hindu gods. Ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation: Indra, Shiva and Vishnu, or Rama. Seemingly, Rama was the most popular, as in \\"Ramathibodhi\\". However, Buddhist influence was also evident, as many times the king's title and \\"unofficial\\" name \\"Dhammaraja\\", an abbreviation of the Buddhist Dharmaraja. The two former concepts were re-established, with a third, older concept taking hold. The king, portrayed by state interests as a semi-divine figure, then became‚Äîthrough a rigid cultural implementation‚Äîan object of worship and veneration to his people. From then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule. Living in palaces designed after Mount Meru (\\"home of the gods\\" in Hinduism), the kings turned themselves into a \\"Chakravartin\\", where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm. Kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as revolving around them, and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies. For four centuries these kings ruled Ayutthaya, presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural, economic, and military growth in Thai History. Other Indianised Rajanates and Sultanates in Southeast Asia In the Malay Annals, the rajas and sultans of the Malay States (today Malaysia, Brunei and Philippines) as well as their predecessors, such as the Indonesian kingdom of Majapahit, also claimed divine right to rule. The sultan is mandated by God and thus is expected to lead his country and people in religious matters, ceremonies as well as prayers. This divine right is called Daulat (which means 'state' in Arabic), and although the notion of divine right is somewhat obsolete, it is still found in the phrase Daulat Tuanku that is used to publicly acclaim the reigning Yang di- Pertuan Agong and the other sultans of Malaysia. The exclamation is similar to the European \\"Long live the King\\", and often accompanies pictures of the reigning monarch and his consort on banners during royal occasions. In Indonesia, especially on the island of Java, the sultan's divine right is more commonly known as the way, or 'revelation', but it is not hereditary and can be passed on to distant relatives.

The dam is long and high, and generates 10 megawatts of power.Water Projects Bureau, p. 1. The dam is a \\"run-of-the- river\\" dam because it can generate electricity without needing to store additional water supplies behind the dam. Construction The dam is named after the town of Toston, Montana, which is just away. A $1.12 million dam was originally proposed in 1935.\\"Toston Dam Seems to be Certain and Work May Start This Fall.\\" Three Forks News. August 15, 1935. This project never was built. A smaller dam, whose construction would cost $900,000, was proposed in 1938, and the Montana State Water Conservation Board sought Public Works Administration funds to help construct the dam.\\"Prospect of Toston Dam is Looking Very Favorable.\\" Three Forks News. May 12, 1938. This effort proved successful, and the federal agency gave the state $820,000 to build the dam.\\"Big Toston Dam Money Allocated.\\" Three Forks News. August 4, 1938. The project was the second-most-expensive hydro effort in the state at the time (only the Tongue River Dam, which cost $1.2 million, was larger). The dam was built on a natural ridge of rock which ran perpendicular to the Missouri River on a point about above Big Spring. An inlet gate was built slightly upstream of the dam which connected to an underground pipeline that exited the ground downstream and connected to an irrigation canal running eastward. A ditch diverted water on the west down a canal for more irrigation purposes. About of Northern Pacific Railroad track was moved and raised to prevent it from being inundated by the Toston Reservoir. The dam was completed 1940. Operation Toston Dam is owned and operated by the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation (DNRC). The dam includes inflatable Flashboards made of rubber at the crest of the dam, which can be used to raise the dam's height slightly (so that more water may be retained). Toston Reservoir, behind the dam, has a storage capacity of of water. About of land are irrigated by the dam. Toston Dam originally did not generate power. But in 1979, the Montana state legislature passed a bill which would have allowed a state rural electrical cooperative to install generators at the dam.Moes, Garry J. \\"Hydro Hunt: Power Play Fails.\\" Spokane Spokesman-Review. June 7, 1980. Governor Thomas Judge vetoed the bill, and the DNRC installed the generators instead. The agency's sole purpose was to generate revenues which it could then use to fund other projects throughout the state. Despite opposition, the agency went ahead in December 1982 with its $23 million plan to install a generating plant.\\"Dam Plans Move Ahead.\\" Associated Press. December 6, 1982. But the power plant did not go online until 1989. Toston Dam generates approximately $900,000 a year in net revenues for the DNRC, which it uses to maintain other state-owned recreation, irrigation, and flood-control projects. Major upgrades have occurred at Toston Dam in the past several years. A $26 million refurbishment in 1989 added the power plant, the inflatable flashboards, and improvements to maintenance and access roads. In 2002, the state spent $450,000 installing automatic \\"rakes\\" along the crest of the dam to clear debris. The rakes prevent damage to the dam, and helped to greatly reduce the number of times the power plant had to be shut down in order to clean the penstocks. In 2005, a bridge was built over the crest of the dam to give maintenance workers access to the dam face and to give the public access to the east side of the river. Conservation issues Toston Dam is threatened with environmental degradation due to invasive species. In 2009, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) warned that the reservoir had been invaded by northern pike which had escaped from private ponds upstream.Henckel, Mark. \\"Pike Create New Fishery Above Toston Dam.\\" Billings Gazette. March 18, 2009. Northern pike are an aggressive predatory fish which feed on trout and other species highly prized by fishermen. A year later, the state sought approval to remove the limit on daily catches of northern pike to protect several trout species, which had come under severe pressure from the pike.Evaro, Donna. \\"FWP Seeks Comments on Fishing Regulations for Season Starting in March.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 12, 2010. In April 2011, the pike problem became so severe that the FWP announced an even more aggressive plan to try to remove the predatory fish from Toston Reservoir and other upstream waters.Byron, Eve. \\"FWP Seeks to Remove Northern Pike From Missouri Headwaters.\\" Helena Independent Record. April 10, 2011. In 2010, FWP officials announced that non- native milfoil had invaded Toston Reservoir and Fort Peck Dam Reservoir.\\"Noxious Milfoil Found in Missouri River at Toston, Fort Peck.\\" Belgrade News. August 24, 2010. Milfoil is classified by the state of Montana as a Priority 1B noxious weed, one of the highest priority invasive species.

The company was developing the Blythe Solar Power Project, the largest solar plant in the world in the Mojave Desert, among other projects. The company was noted for having turned down a $2.1 billion loan guarantee by the Department of Energy (DOE) for the construction of the Blythe project. Uwe T. Schmidt was CEO. On April 2, 2012, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Solar Trust of America files bankruptcy, Reuters, April 2, 2012 History Solar Trust of America was founded in 2009 to develop utility scale solar energy projects in American Southwest. The company was a joint venture between Solar Millennium and Ferrostaal. As of September 19, 2013 the assets of the company have been liquidated per order of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross and all operational activities have ceased. The case is In re: Solar Trust of America LLC, case number 12-11136, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Technology The company's projects employed parabolic trough concentrated solar power technology. Specifically, Solar Trust of America uses the new Heliotrough technology, developed by Flagsol GmbH. Heliotrough reduces costs by about 20% compared to its predecessor Skal-ET. The cost reduction is achieved through a 10% increase in efficiency. Due to improvements in reflector geometry, 99% of solar irradiation can now be reflected onto the absorber pipe, compared to 95% previously. In June 2010, Heliotrough won the \\"Concentrated Solar Power Innovation Award\\" at the 4th Concentrated Solar Power Conference in San Francisco. Projects Solar Trust of America had 2,000 MW of solar projects in advanced stages of permitting at locations throughout California and Nevada, including the world‚Äôs largest permitted solar power plant facility near Blythe, CA. Other projects were proposed near Palen, CA and Amargosa Valley, NV. =The Blythe Solar Power Project= Solar Trust of America was developing the Blythe Solar Power Project, originally specified as a 1,000 MW concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in east Riverside County, California. The multibillion-dollar Blythe Project would have included four independent 250 MW plants that combined could have delivered 1,000 MW of nominal generating capacity to the California power grid. On October 25, 2010, Solar Millennium LLC, the development subsidiary of Solar Trust of America, received full permitting by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to develop of public land for the project. Originally intended to use concentrated thermal technology, the planned first phase of the Blythe Solar Power Project was changed to photovoltaics in 2011. The company cited both the plunging price of photovoltaic panels and the comparative ease of obtaining commercial financing for the more conventional design. The project was sold off to NextEra Energy in 2012, and land clearing for the project began in 2015.Chris Clarke, Vegetation Clearing Starts at Desert Solar Project, KCET January 23, 2015 Loan guarantee Though it had successfully sought a Department of Energy a $2.1 billion loan guarantee based on its original design, the technology change caused Solar Trust to turn down the federal assistance. The loan guarantee, conditionally approved in April 2011, would have been the largest ever made by the DOE for a renewable energy project, and the second largest overall in the history of the program.

She coined the term \\"Halloween Carols\\" to describe her music compositions that celebrate the autumnal season.  Biography  = Early years = Kristen Elise Lawrence was born in Orange County, California and fondly calls Disneyland's Haunted Mansion her second home. After studying piano for five years, she began her organ studies at age 12 from Pulitzer Prize-nominated composer/organist Dr. Robert Cummings. During her high school years she played at church services, arranged music for choral ensembles, and was the featured guest organist at a community Handel's Messiah Sing-along. In 1993 she won a Philharmonic Society of Orange County music competition. She accepted a music scholarship to Brigham Young University, studying organ under Dr. Parley Belnap and Dr. Douglas Bush, where her experiences ranged from accompanying on the organ in front of audiences of 20,000 at televised live devotional broadcasts, to singing in the Early Music Ensemble, to performing as a can-can dancer in the university's production of Franz Leh√°r's The Merry Widow. She graduated from BYU in 2001 with a Bachelor of Music in organ performance and pedagogy, and taught music in Salt Lake City, Utah and Orange County, California. = Performances = As well as teaching music, playing organ for weddings, funerals/memorial services and church services after college, she arranged and played keyboard in the pop rock band, Checkpoint Charley, recording one album with them and winning the B. B. King‚Äôs Battle of the Bands in Hollywood in 2005. Lawrence was introduced as a \\"Halloween Specialist\\" when she played guest keyboards with all-female Iron Maiden tribute metal band, The Iron Maidens, in their October 2010 \\"Heavy Metal Halloween Show\\" where she met Iron Maiden keyboardist Michael Kenney and \\"Eddie\\" artist Derek Riggs. This was a happy coincidence; Lawrence and Riggs had each been featured in the same Rue Morgue magazine Halloween issue that fall. In October 2008, Lawrence began performing with Pacific Symphony for the family and school concerts when she was cast as the spooky music teacher/organist in their Halloween Spooktacular, playing on the $3 million C. B. Fisk-built William J. Gillespie Concert Organ in the Ren√©e and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall in the Orange County Performing Arts Center. Lawrence again performed with Pacific Symphony for their 2011 Halloween family program, opening the show with Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 as well as demonstrating to the audience how the massive pipe organ is played. Besides performing, Kristen's composition skills were utilized when she was asked to score John Williams' Jurassic Park for organ to play with the orchestra. In addition to her performing with Pacific Symphony, she also performs with the Pacific Symphony Youth Orchestra and their ensembles when an organist is needed.  A unique kind of music  = Music genre = Lawrence's music and lyrics have been called unique and eclectic, colored by the diversified influences of Bach, Tori Amos, Loreena McKennitt, Danny Elfman, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Nightwish. Lawrence incorporates these classical, rock, and folk genres and arranges them into her elegant quirky songs for Halloween and the autumnal season. Lawrence's original vampire-themed music, with her luxurious \\"Blood Waltz\\" and the lush \\"Vampire Empire\\", showcases her clear soprano voice. Her use of harpsichord and organ, as well as her somewhat dark subject matter‚Äîas in \\"Sleeping Dust\\" (a death lullaby) ‚Äîhave afforded her a nod by many as an \\"honorary goth\\". And yet, her \\"Cats in the Catacombs\\" is pure whimsy in featuring her cat's hisses and yowls as the clever lyrics use words beginning with \\"cat.\\" Rue Morgue magazine Music Editor, Trevor Tuminski described Lawrence's music this way: \\"Lawrence spins ethereal tales with a balance of macabre elements and kid-friendly whimsy ... that give her creations an instantly classic, fun-for-all-ages feel.\\" = Halloween Carols = The interest in Halloween and songwriting came together one day when she was playing the organ at a funeral, and the tune to the traditional round, \\"Ghost of John,\\" wove through her head. This provided the inspiration that began her musical journey; she wrote the first four songs based on Halloween traditions that day when she returned home. Lawrence first composes each Halloween Carol as a round, where it harmonizes itself (with the exception of \\"Dark Glass\\"). She then composes the melody into four-part harmony where the chords of the carol differ from the repeating chords of the round to give interest and variety. She then writes the lyrics and orchestrates the music. Lawrence created her \\"Halloween Carols\\" for people to enjoy playing during the autumnal season, just as Christmas carols are enjoyed during December. By 2009, she had written over 60 Halloween Carols about trick-or-treating, witches, haunted houses, cats, bats, vampires, ghosts, and pumpkins, as well as the deeper aspects of Halloween history, releasing them over time in her albums. Stephen Fortner, Executive Editor of Keyboard Magazine (October 2010) foretold a spooky coincidence by stating that Kristen's \\"... Halloween carols produce \\"an elegance Jack Skellington never quite managed. If the Halloween Town of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas had a resident keyboardist, it would be Kristen Lawrence.\\" Who would have guessed that the planets would align so that Steve Bartek, the orchestrator for Nightmare and other Tim Burton film music, would be playing guitar with Kristen's latest music projects! = Halloween Research = The desire to begin researching the history of Halloween germinated during a college semester abroad in Austria in 1999 as she tramped through the leaves in the Vienna Woods and noticed people celebrating All Saints' Day (also called All Hallows) and All Souls' Day. Halloween had always been a time of fun, but its history now intrigued her. Lawrence continued her research on cultures and traditions of Halloween when she returned to BYU, gathering a large collection of books and articles to study further after she graduated. Favorite researchers include professor of folklore Jack Santino and Halloween expert Lesley Bannatyne Lawrence was asked by Bannatyne to make comments about Halloween music to be included in her book, Halloween Nation: Behind the Scenes of America‚Äôs Fright Night. In addition to her original compositions, Lawrence researches traditional folk songs and arranges them for organ. The songs are largely based on the older roots of Halloween traditions, from pagan ceremonies to the Christian traditions that eventually melded with them. = Music Producer =  Arachnitect  The title song of her first album, Arachnitect, is her quirky rock arrangement that touches on the children's classic theme of \\"Spider and the Fly,\\" complete with a harpsichord and guitar-driven \\"silent-film-esque\\" chase scene across a web. She scored two versions of the American folk tune, \\"Ghost of John,\\" one orchestrated with influences from Bach and Ralph Vaughan Williams, and the other \\"Bare Bones\\" version for voice and organ. She added several verses of new lyrics for poor John, describing his deteriorating body.  A Broom with a View  In researching for her second CD, A Broom with a View, Lawrence found two tunes associated with soul cakes. She combined and arranged her \\"Souling Songs\\" with additional original melodies into two versions with very different perspectives of the cultural forces behind Halloween‚Äîpaganism and Christianity. As she played around with the traditional Cheshire tune, she was hit with an epiphany that the beginning notes are the same as the medieval plainchant Dies Irae, \\"Day of Judgment,\\" calling the people to repent and pray for the dead. It struck her as plausible that the Cheshire tune could be a folk corruption of the chant as children and beggars asked for cakes in return for praying for the dead. She then wrote the Samhain version from the prospective of the dead coming to visit and enjoying some soul cakes.  Vampire Empire  Lawrence edited songs from her first two albums, Arachnitect and A Broom with a View, to create an album with songs to meet the time constraints to play on the radio. She also added the instrumental version of \\"Dark Glass\\" to the playlist.  The Raven  In the 2012 CD album with title song, Edgar Allan Poe‚Äôs \\"The Raven,\\" Lawrence sings all 18 verses of Poe's famous poem as if she were the ghost of Lenore. The musical setting with organ and strings reflects Lawrence's serious study and analysis of Poe's essays, The Philosophy of Composition and The Poetic Principle. Lawrence's \\"The Raven\\" music was used throughout a month-long program sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts THE BIG READ: Shades of Poe in San Diego and Burbank, California. The events and performances are designed to encourage and inspire the community through stories, music, authors, art, poetry, film, actors and dance to read the works of Edgar Allan Poe.  Hallowe'en: Night of Spirits  \\"Night of Spirits\\" is one of the old names for Halloween, and the traditions from both Pagan Celtic as well as medieval Christian influences are presented in this double album. The etymology of \\"haunt\\" relates to the concept of home ‚Äì a place to inhabit or linger. It was a night to discern spirits: whom to welcome and whom to ward away. Lawrence not only wrote all the music and lyrics (except for the traditional Scottish words in \\"Bumps In The Night\\"), but she also performed all the vocals and played organ, harpsichord, celesta, bells and piano and contributed various sound effects. = Discography = ALBUMS * Arachnitect (2008) * A Broom with a View (2009) * Vampire Empire (2009) * Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Raven\\" (2012) * Hallowe'en: Night of Spirits\\" (2018) SINGLES * Zombie Ambience (2015) * Zombie Ambience (\\"Zombies Around Steve Bartek\\" Version) (2015) * Zombie Ambience (\\"Quick Bite\\" Radio Edit) (2015) * Gust (\\"Ghost Town\\" Version) (2015) * Gust (\\"Crossroads\\" Version) (2015) * Witch of the Salem Town (2019) GUEST PERFORMERS Besides organ and keyboard skills, Kristen also shows the \\"rock\\" side and features special guest performers.

Jayan worked in malayalam cinema, a sector of the Indian movie industry based in Kerala and was a highly popular stunt actor of his time. Jayan quotes began as an internet & sms phenomenon amongst malayalees around the world in the early 2000s as part of the Jayan phenomenon & resurgence which started in the late 1990s. These satirical quotes are the first known collection of its kind from anywhere in the world (other factoids like those on Chuck Norris, Kyle Katarn, Rajnikanth, Dharmendra etc. emerged later after 2004). Soon the quotes attained mainstream popularity and have become an integral part of popular culture in Kerala. Origin =Jayan's superhuman image= The idea behind the origin of the quotes can be traced back to the action thrillers of the late 1970s in Malayalam which were filled with high risk stunt performances from Jayan who seldom relied on stunt doubles. Through such monumental stunt feats, his machismo image, masculine base voice and unique attire like elvis bellbottoms, Jayan had attained a reallife superhero image at the peak of his career. After his death in a helicopter accident while performing a stunt, these gradually paved way to the actor transforming into a legend over time while the fascination towards his image & style remained dormant in later generations, eventually giving rise to his persona's depiction as a comic superhero and in the process, the Jayan quotes. =1990s Mimics Movement= Jayan quotes is related to the popularity of mimicry, an artform of imitation, comedy skits and impersonation, which gained mainstream fame among malayalee communities in the 1990s. Mimics sector was going through a period of stagnation with washed up ideas and worn out programs and at one point of time, was even facing a threat of dying out. It was during this crisis period that some groups decided to exploit Jayan's image and devised impersonations & skits based on Jayan persona which became instant hits giving rise to full scale commercialisation of the persona which was presented as a comic superhero who frequently delivered signature quotes demonstrating superhuman strength. Format Jayan quotes follow a unique pattern in that these are dialogues which are almost always in first person (unlike other trending factoids & jokes which are in third person). These dialogues are depicted as being said by Jayan or the person in the Jayan persona (although the actor has never uttered a single such quote in his lifetime). All known Jayan quotes are originally in Malayalam language which are translated to English in this article. Most of the quotes follow a general format; If there was \\"this\\", could've turned into \\"that\\" or If \\"this\\" was available, (I) could've done \\"that\\". For example, a popular Jayan quote is \\"If there was a football field with four wells, could've played a game of carrom\\". There are also quotes which do not follow this general rule such as another quote which says: \\"What? the money purse in my pocket was actually a cement bag?\\" =Voice & Style= The voice style used to say Jayan quotes actually come from the style of dialogue delivery in Jayan films released after the actor's death in which the voice was dubbed by Alleppey Ashraf, a popular mimicry artist of the time. Although the tone does resemble Jayan's original sound, the voice imitated widely in mimics programs and grotesquely used style is that of Alleppey Ashraf. Actor Jayan is not known to have ever uttered a single Jayan quote during his life. =Popular quotes= English translations of some of the highly popular quotes are given below: * Had I got a python, could have used it as a belt * If a storm blew, could've enjoyed the breeze. * If a volcano blew, could've enjoyed the warmth. * If the sun could be reached, could've enjoyed a sun bath. * If a knife was available, could've pricked the skin. * If there was an elephant here, could've done some wrestling (same quote replacing elephant by \\"crocodile\\") See also * Chuck Norris facts  Bibliography  * Mathrubhumi Weekly, November 21, 2010 * Chithrabhumi, November 25, 2010  References  Internet memes ","title":"Jayan quotes"},{"id":"31546691","title":"2011 Arkansas Razorbacks football team"},{"id":"31546693","text":"Mian are Rajput clans of Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh states in India.

Reedy held a variety of research and leadership positions within the organization, including the head of Research Operations and four years as associate director. Early life and education Reedy was born in Johnson City, Tennessee on April 22, 1940. He attended high school at Boones Creek High School. Reedy received a Bachelor of Science in 1963, a Master of Science in 1964 and a Ph.D. in 1968 in electrical engineering, all from the University of Tennessee. Career Reedy was in the United States Army Reserve for 21 years, which included two years (1968-1970) as a Captain (Signal Corps Officer) at the Communications Electronics Command in Fort Monmouth, New Jersey. In 1970, Reedy joined the Georgia Tech Research Institute as a junior research engineer. Reedy steadily progressed through the ranks; from 1974 to 1975, he was the head of the Systems Technology Branch; from 1975 to 1977 he was the Chief of the Radar Application Division; and from 1977 to 1990 (13 years) he was the director of GTRI's Radar and Instrumentation Laboratory. In 1990, he became a Laboratory Group Director, where he was responsible for approximately half of the organization. From 1993 to 1997, Reedy was the associate director of GTRI and director of research operations. Reedy has been an adjunct professor for Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering since 1987. After GTRI director Richard Truly's departure in March 1997 to become director of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Reedy served as interim director for eight months, and was subsequently named director of GTRI. As director, Reedy was particularly influential in securing the $7.3 million in funding required to build the Food Processing Technology Building. Under his leadership, GTRI's first endowed chair was established in March 1998 in honor of Glen P. Robinson, the $1.5 million Glen P. Robinson Chair in Electro-Optics. GTRI and Georgia Tech played host to sitting president George W. Bush in March 2002, and demonstrated new technologies in a simulated disaster. In 2003, Reedy retired from the GTRI directorship after 33 years at the organization and seven as director. Reedy currently works part- time for the GTRI Sensors and Electromagnetic Applications Laboratory and as an independent consultant. Memberships and honors Reedy is an IEEE member, and was named an IEEE Fellow in 1991 \\"for technical leadership and contributions to developing and exploiting the millimeter wavelengths in radar applications\\". In 1995, he was the president of IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society. From 1998 to 2000, Reedy served on IEEE's national board and was Director of Division IX. In addition, Reedy has served on numerous IEEE committees including the IEEE Technical Activities Board (1995 to 2001). In 2000, he received the IEEE Third Millennium Medal. Since 2002, he has been on the IEEE Strategic Planning Committee, and since 2004, he has been on the selection committee for the IEEE Dennis J. Picard Medal for Radar Technologies and Applications. Reedy is currently Executive Chair of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society Radar Conference, RadarCon. Reedy was on the Army Science Board for two three-year terms, from 1993 to 1996 and 1999 to 2005, and served on a Tri-Service Panel led by the Naval Research Advisory Committee to study the \\"Science and Technology Community in Crisis\\". In 2004, he was named an honorary alumnus of the Georgia Institute of Technology.
