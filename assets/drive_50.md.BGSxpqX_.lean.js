There were also at different times five taverns, three stores, two tanneries, four blacksmith shops, a pottery, a brewery, a wagon shop, a lead pipe factory and several weaver shops. By 1886 all that remained of the businesses was a blacksmith shop. Pierstown was becoming more of an agricultural zone. But like any other area in upstate New York, farming declined in the last quarter of the 20th century. Pierstown was named after The Pƒ´er family was among the earliest settlers in what was called the Great Barrington Purchase and arrived c. 1786.

White Company Mill Complex, is a historic industrial complex at 140 Water Street in North Bennington, Vermont. The White Company was founded in 1879, producing stereographic viewers and stereograph cards, as well as the Kiddie-Kar, a three-wheeled wooden scooter for children. These premises were occupied by the company from then until its closure in 1935. The complex, with buildings dating from 1887 to 1919, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The former White Company Mill complex is located on the south side of North Bennington, on the west bank of Paran Brook above its mouth at the Walloomsac River. The complex includes a number of brick and wood-frame buildings, as well as a c. 1900 concrete dam across the brook, creating a mill pond north of the complex. The oldest building in the complex is a timber-framed three-story building constructed in 1887, after an earlier mill building was destroyed by fire. The major feature of the complex is a larger three-story brick building dating to the late 1910s. Other significant buildings include a two-story office building and a smaller two-story factory building. A number of smaller buildings dot the site. Hawley C. White was a North Bennington native who learned the trade of grinding optical lenses in New York City. He returned to North Bennington in 1874, where he continued this trade, apparently in partnership with B.G. Surdam, producing lenses and stereoscope viewers. In 1878 White struck out on his own, acquiring this property, which then had industrial buildings already standing. These were destroyed by fire in 1887, after which White quickly rebuilt. In 1899 White expanded his business to include the production of stereoscopic images, sending photographers out to take pictures of the wonders of man and nature across the world. The company's high-quality images made it one of the leading producers of such imagery for over a decade. In the 1910s, seeking a new market, White embarked on the manufacture of wooden children's furniture and the highly popular Kiddie-Kar, a three-wheeled scooter. The company exited the steoroscope business in 1915, selling its image collection to the Keystone View Company. The company survived until 1935, when it went into receivership and closed. The complex has since been adapted to a variety of other uses, including office space, light industrial manufacturing, and residences. Substantial expansion occurred following the Second World War when the building operated as a printing press. Building 3 (two floors, each 20,000 square feet) was then added in 1959 and Building 5 was added in 1969, providing a further 15,000 square feet of space. The next major use was under the ownership of Chem Fab, later St. Gobain. From the late 1970s the buildings served as a small business incubator under the management of Bennington County Industrial Corporation. In 2007 the buildings were acquired by HRH Management, a property development company. Since that time, the buildings have been heavily renovated to standards set by the National Park Service; the industrial uses have largely remained but a significant number of apartments have been constructed, giving the buildings a healthy new lease on life See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Bennington County, Vermont References Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Buildings and structures completed in 1887 Buildings and structures in Bennington, Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Bennington County, Vermont Stereoscopy ","title":"H.C.

She and her sister, Laura B. Wikoff Pahmeyer (1855-1933), played key roles in the cultural and scientific growth of their community while also helping to advance women's rights during the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s through their development of financial support services for women. Early life Ida Wikoff Baker was born in Decatur, Illinois, on July 31, 1859. Her father, Peter Montfort Wikoff (1826-1899), a butcher and farmer, was a native of Warren County, Ohio, who moved with his father to Illinois while quite young. He was a descendant of Peter Cloesen Wikoff, who came from Holland in 1636 and settled on Long Island, where he held a position under the Dutch Government. He married Margaret Van Ness. Baker's mother, whose maiden name was Elizabeth Fletcher (1824-1896), was born near Crotches' Ferry, Maryland. Career In 1889 Baker's sister, Laura B. Wikoff Pahmeyer (1855-1933), organized a stock company composed of women only, for the purpose of promoting the industrial, educational and social advancement of women, and for literary, scientific and musical culture in the city of Decatur.

Williams was motivated to revisit the older material by her husband and manager Tom Overby, who co-produced the album with her. The release has received positive reviews. Reception Mark Deming of AllMusic Guide gave the album a positive assessment, with the editorial staff ranking it 3.5 out of five stars. Deming calls this release \\"a genuine improvement\\" over the famously fraught 1992 album, with his only complaint being the wearing on Williams' voice due to age. Writing for Exclaim!, Mark Dunn gave the album seven out of 10, agreeing that Williams' voice has changed dramatically in the ensuing 25 years but noting that she uses it as an instrument masterfully, pairing it with stripped-down country arrangements, compared to the more pop feel of the 1992 release. George de Stefano of PopMatters gave the release nine out of 10, calling it a \\"surprising and bold move\\" and writes that both the re-recordings and the new tracks are \\"gems\\". In The San Francisco Chronicle, Joshua Zucker calls the album a document of Williams' musical evolution, with a mix of live energy, emotional lyrics, and rocking sound. In The Independent, Andy Gill recommended several tracks for download and gave the album five out of five stars, summing up: Her voice, meanwhile, has grown into these songs splendidly: it‚Äôs amazing how much brazen sensuality she can bring to an image like ‚ÄúSaw you in the laundromat, washing your clothes/Getting all the dirt out‚Äù.

In it, 'the Hyksos king Apophis challenges Seqenre, the local ruler of Thebes, with an adynaton [puzzle] (the hippopotami of Thebes disturb with their cries the sleep of Apophis, who resides at Avaris on the Nile Delta, hundreds of miles away). The end of the tale has been lost, but Seqenenre presumably found a solution, perhaps with the help of a wise counsellor.' It is part of a wider corpus of ancient Egyptian tales of wisdom- contests: it has some similarities, for example, to the much later \\"Tale of Setne Khamwas and Si-Osire\\", attested on papyrus in the Roman period.Ioannis M.

He was the main author of the landmark book Introductory Mycology, commonly used in mycology and mycology-related courses in undergrad and grad schools around the globe. Introductory Mycology was translated into five languages.  Education  Although born in the United States of America, Alexopoulos studied in Athens until the beginning of high school, when he returned to his birthplace of Chicago in October 1919. Alexopoulos had to move to Greece at an early age to accompany his deployed father who joined the Greek army in the Balkan Wars. After returning to the US, Alexopoulos finished high school at Lane Technical High School and already showed interest in plants. From this interest, his career choice arose and he started horticulture at the University of Illinois in 1923. His master studies were focused on \\"the cytology of microsporogenesis of raspberry hybrids\\". Alexopoulos received his M.Sc. degree in 1928. Alexopoulos got a Ph.D. degree in 1932 based on his research entitled \\"Pycnidial Fungi from Vitis\\".  Career  Alexopoulos was unlucky to obtain his Ph.D. degree at the beginning of the Great Depression, a period of unprecedented economic crisis in the USA. After his former Ph.D. advisor Frank Lincoln Stevens had a heart attack, Alexopoulos started to work as a full-time instructor teaching classes in Mycology from 1934 to 1935, when he was then hired by Kent State University (KSU) as an instructor in Biology. During this job, Alexopoulos met his soon-to-be wife Juliet Dowdy. After KSU, Alexopoulos worked at the Institute of Chemistry and Agriculture, in Greece and the Rubber Development Corporation, in Brazil. In 1947, Alexopoulos started working at Michigan State University (MSU), where he published the first edition of the infamous Introductory Mycology book in 1952. He worked as a Full Professor at MSU from 1952 to 1956, when he moved to the University of Iowa. In 1962, Alexopoulos took the position as a faculty member at University of Texas at Austin, where he lived the rest of his career and life In 1939 he married Juliet Dowdy, a music instructor.  Scientific production and contribution  Alexopoulos identified and named several species like Echinostelium elachiston, Echinostelium cribrarioides, Physarella oblonga f. alba, and higher taxa, such as Acrasiogymnomycotina. He participated in 85 publications during his life, half of which focused on Myxomycetes. A list of his most notable publications is shown below.

On the upper branches of Alexopoulos' \\"scientific genealogic tree\\" lies the Heinrich Anton De Bary known as the Father of Plant Pathology.  Memberships, positions and awards  Alexopoulos' career granted him recognition by many different organizations around the globe. Alexopoulos received honors such as the Fulbright research fellow (1954) by the University of Athens, Distinguished Mycologist (1981) and W.H. Weston Award for Teaching Excellence in Mycology by the Mycological Society of America (1983). Currently, Alexopoulos names an award for mycologists - annually, the Mycological Society of America rewards mycologists in early career with the C.J. Alexopoulos Prize, in recognition to their outstanding work Alexopoulos was the last mycologist to be the President of the Botanical Society of America, a landmark of the connection loss between these two fields of science.

On his final appearance in the Maghull Novices' Hurdle at Aintree, he finished a long way behind and was found to be lame.Raceform Up-To-Date Form Book National Hunt Annual 1977/78 Published by Raceform Ltd  1978/79 Season  Silver Buck embarked on a novice chase program in this season. He won five out of his seven starts, establishing himself as one of the best in his sphere. He won all of his first four starts at Teesside, Wetherby, Stratford and Leicester. At Wetherby he beat Alverton, who himself would go on and win a Cheltenham Gold Cup. He suffered a defeat when brought down at Windsor, then lined up for the final of the Embassy Premier Chase, run over two and a half miles at Haydock Park. The race had been due to be staged in its original spot in January, but the meeting was abandoned and the race saved and moved to early March. Silver Buck came up against the dual Champion Hurdle winner Night Nurse, who had started brightly in his career over fences, winning five of his six starts prior to this race. In a seven-runner field Silver Buck, ridden by the stable jockey Tommy Carmody, started 5/2 second favourite. The race turned out to be a memorable one. Night Nurse went to the front from the beginning and stayed there until being joined by Silver Buck, at the first fence on the far side. They raced side by side until Silver Buck took a definite lead turning for home. Night Nurse fought back, and landed in front over the final fence, but Silver Buck proved the better on the long run in and passed the winning line two and a half lengths clear. Timeform stated that, ' Silver Buck and Night Nurse put on a superb, unforgettable exhibition'. On his final appearance of the season, Silver Buck finished third in the Sun Alliance Chase at the Cheltenham festival, run on heavy ground.Chasers & Hurdlers 1978/79 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1979/1980 Season  Silver Buck was unbeaten in all of his six starts during this season - he also took a seventh race by means of a walk over. He began the season with wins at Wincanton and Hereford. He next appeared in the Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase at Haydock Park in November. Although there were only three runners, the field was made up of Night Nurse and Border Incident, both high class chasers. Silver Buck beat Night Nurs by one and a half lengths. His next race was on Boxing Day when he lined up for the King George VI Chase at Kempton Park. Silver Buck faced ten rivals and started the 3/1 second favourite behind the Irish trained Jack Of Trumps. Silver Buck was always close up and led down the back straight for the final time. He was never headed after and saw off the challenge of Jack Of Trumps to win by a length and a half, with Border Incident a further twenty lengths back in third. His next lined up at Newbury in February, for the Compton Chase. The race was run on heavy ground, conditions under which he had run below par in the past. He eventually won, beating Royal Mail by two lengths, but failed to impress. In early March Silver Buck appeared in a small race at Hereford, which was to be his prep for the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He won but again was far from impressive. He was later found to have a low blood count which put his participation at Cheltenham in doubt. Silver Buck's connections eventually withdrew him from the Cheltenham Gold Cup on the morning of the race, but this was due to other circumstances. They cited the heavy ground as the reason for him not taking his place in the race.Chasers & Hurdlers 1979/80 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1980/1981 Season  In this season,Silver Buck won five of his seven races. He started the season with victories at Worcester and Folkestone, then followed up last season's win in the Edward Hanmer Memorial Chase at Haydock Park . He then had a prep race in early December for the King George VI Chase. This was at Catterick , and though beaten a length by Sunset Cristo, he was conceding 34 lb to that rival, who went on to prove himself a useful horse in his own right. Silver Buck had seven rivals to contend with in the 1980 King George VI Chase. He started the 9/4 favourite in the betting, ahead of the Fulke Walwyn trained Diamond Edge, the front-running Irish mare Anaglog's Daughter, and old adversary, Night Nurse . Silver Buck took the lead from Anaglog's Daughter four fences from home, but was being hard pressed by Night Nurse when that rival unseated his rider at the last. The race reader reporting for Raceform that day, John Hanmer, that 'Night Nurse looked the likely winner' before his mishap.Chaseform Note Book 1980/1981 Published by Raceform Ltd Silver Buck appeared once between Kempton Park and Cheltenham, when winning the Jim Ford Challenge Cup at Wincanton by three lengths from Artifice. Silver Buck faced 14 opponents in the 1981 Cheltenham Gold Cup. He started the 7/2 favourite ahead of the Peter Easterby trained pair Little Owl and Night Nurse. Silver Buck was well in contention as the race heated up and had every chance when making an untidy jump at the second last. His stamina then appeared to fail him and he eventually finished in third place, behind Little Owl and Night Nurse. The general consensus was that three and a quarter miles on soft ground was too much of a test of stamina for Silver Buck to produce his very best form.Chasers & Hurdlers 1980/81 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1981/1982 Season  Silver Buck ran five times this season, winning on four occasions. He was partnered by his new jockey, Robert Earnshaw. He began the campaign with a victory at Wincanton, then suffered an unexpected reversal on his next start in November, in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow. He fell four fences from home when already well out of contention. John Hanmer was the Raceform representative at Chepstow that day and wrote, \\"there was clearly something radically wrong, as this is not his form at all.\\"Chaseform Note Book 1981/1982 Published by Raceform Ltd Silver Buck returned later in the month to win the Edward Hanmer Chase at Haydock Park for the third year in succession, on this occasion beating Sunset Cristo by a length and a half, with Night Nurse a long way back in third. However, the result may have been different if the Irish trained runner Royal Bond had not fallen when challenging at the final fence. The 1981 King George VI Chase was lost to freezing weather, but Silver Buck had injured a hind foot shortly before and would not have been able to take his place anyway. The injury had caused speculation that he might miss Cheltenham but he recuperated in time for him to reappear for a prep at Market Rasen in the first week in March, where he led all the way to successfully give weight away to inferior rivals. Twenty two runners lined up for the 1982 Cheltenham Gold Cup. With heavy ground prevailing again, Silver Buck started at 8/1 in the betting, with Night Nurse, Royal Bond, and Venture To Cognac being preferred in the market. Silver Buck won by two lengths from stable companion Bregawn, with Sunset Cristo a further twelve lengths back in third. Raceform's John Sharratt reported, \\" ...Silver Buck disproved once and for all the supposition that he does not get the trip in testing ground.... the challenge of his stable companion was just the spur he needed to make him stretch out, and there is not the slightest doubt he won on merit.\\" Timeform considered his Gold Cup victory to be the best performance of his career. He was their Champion Jumper of the season. Silver Buck also received twenty five of the thirty one votes to win the National Hunt Horse Of The Year Award.Chaser & Hurdlers 1981/82 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1982/1983 Season  Silver Buck won four of his six races during this season. Following victories at Wincanton and Stratford, Silver Buck won his fourth Edward Hanmer Chase at Haydock Park in November, beating future Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Burrough Hill Lad by two and a half lengths. He then lined up against five other rivals in the King George VI Chase, where he started the even money favourite. Silver Buck could only finish third behind stable companion,Wayward Lad, and the Fred Winter-trained, Fifty Dollars More. Michael Dickinson considered that a throat infection may have affected Silver Buck's performance. Silver Buck prepped for Cheltenham with a victory in a small handicap at Market Rasen. Eleven runners lined up for the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup. Dickinson ran five horses in the race and Silver Buck started the 5/1 third favourite behind Bregawn and the David Elsworth-trained Combs Ditch. In a race famous for Dickinson training the first five home, Silver Buck could only finish a distant fourth behind Bregawn, Captain John, and Wayward Lad. Ashley House finished fifth. That was Silver Buck's final race of the season and he was now eleven years old. Despite being beaten in both the King George VI Chase, and Cheltenham Gold Cup, his annual Timeform rating of 171, was only 4 lb below his rating of the previous year. This was based on the merit of his performance in the Edward Hanmer Chase.Chasers & Hurdlers 1982/83 A Timeform Publication Portway Press Ltd  1983/1984 Season  This was to be Silver Buck's last season of racing. He ran eight times in all, winning five of his races. He won his first two starts at Folkestone and Market Rasen. The Edward Hanmer Chase was lost to the weather, which meant that Silver Buck next appeared in the Rehearsal Chase at Chepstow in December, where he finished second to the Fred Winter trained Observe. He next appeared at Cheltenham in January, winning the Courage Cup Handicap under top weight. Shortly after he won at Wincanton beating Half Free, then came two disappointing performances in succession, as Silver Buck finished last in both the Gainsborough Chase at Sandown Park, and Greenall Whitley Chase at Haydock Park. His last appearance on the racecourse was a winning one. This came on Easter Monday at Wetherby, where he beat three opponents in the H.S.Commercial Spares Handicap.Chaseform Annual 1983/84 Published by Raceform Ltd  Death  Silver Buck died in a freak accident at Dickinson's Harewood stables in 1984. Graham Bradley was aboard him, preparing to make his way to the gallops. It began to rain so they returned to the yard and Bradley changed into waterproofs. As he was remounting the abrasive sound of the waterproofs against the saddle spooked Silver Buck, who took off suddenly across the yard, colliding with a stable block wall. The vet diagnosed a compound fracture of the pelvis, and Silver Buck had to be put down immediately to save him from further suffering.'The Wayward Lad' Autobiography of Graham Bradley Greenwater Publishing 2000  References  1972 racehorse births 1984 racehorse deaths Racehorses bred in Ireland Cheltenham Gold Cup winners National Hunt racehorses ","title":"Silver Buck"},{"id":"55374678","text":"This was the first edition of the tournament.

Josina Machel Hospital in Luanda. Lucr√©cia Pa√≠m Maternity Hospital. Our Lady of Peace Hospital. Healthcare in Angola consists of a network of hospitals, clinics, and dispensaries. Description The National Health Service in Angola is run by the Ministry of Health, the Provincial Governments run Provincial Hospitals and the Municipal Administrations run Municipal Hospitals, Health Care Units and Posts. The Municipal Administrations are leading the primary healthcare network. Services are free, since independence in 1975, but very limited in rural areas. Medicine is regulated by the General Health Inspection and the National Directorate of Health which manage the National List of Essential Medicines. Medicinal products are regulated by the National Pricing System. Tendering for medical products is run by the Centralized Medicine Purchase Authority which also distributes medicine. Staffing Due to the length of the Angolan Civil War, nearly an entire generation of Angolans was not given the opportunity to receive any education. This has led to a dramatic decrease of health workers and added to the poor maternal health problem. In response to the shortage of health workers, Cuban physicians are currently working in the country to improve health overall, as well as to focus on improving maternal health.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mA1SnN4N_zo. Accessed 9, 2012 The health care system has felt the social effects of the War. Due to the large number of people who were unable to receive an education during the War, today, educated medical personnel, administrators, and other needed positions in the governmental system are not able to be filled. The population of Angola has lost nearly an entire generation of educated personnel. It was estimated in 2012 that there were about 0.08 physicians per 1,000 people in Angola.CIA Factbook April 9, 2012 Operation Some improvements were made after the end of the Civil War. According to UNICEF reports in 2005, 2% of the nation's public expenditures were allotted to health care. That number increased after 2005. Larger problems include the shortage of doctors, the destruction of health care facilities throughout the country, and disparities between rural and urban primary care availability.http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/angola_54038.html. Accessed April 30, 2012. Public spending on health decreased after 2014. The free public health system was still described as severely underfunded and understaffed in 2020. The medical technology and infrastructure is outdated and the system is difficult to access, so both locals and expatriates opt for private healthcare. Private healthcare insurance often has cover for emergency evacuation to better healthcare facilities in South Africa or other neighbouring countries. The Cl√≠nica Multiperfil in Luanda, although publicly owned, was granted special status by former President Jos√© Eduardo dos Santos, and is allowed to charge for care. Most of its patients are insured politicians and members of the military. Hospitals cannot always provide prescribed medication and patients may have to buy this, and some medical supplies, privately. History The healthcare system in Angola suffered considerably during the Angolan War of Independence (1961‚Äì1975) and the subsequent civil war (1975 ‚Äì 2002). Healthcare facilities were dilapidated, equipment was not maintained, and medical supplies which are almost all imported were very scarce. Wealthier people could get treatment at private hospitals, but the public system barely functioned. The Government of Japan set up a grant aid project, the ‚ÄúProject for Improvement of Medical Equipment in Primary Health Facilities in Luanda Province,‚Äù in 2000 with the intention of improving the 27 health centres there. This was followed by finance of almost 3 million yen for the planned reconstruction and repair of Josina Machel Hospital, the main specialist referral centre in the country. Procurement of medical supplies and equipment was, and still is, complicated by the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate.

When European conquistadors invaded Peru, they brought with them diseases against which the Inca population had no immunity. Much of the population was decimated, and this marked an important turning point in the nature of Peruvian healthcare. Since Peru gained independence, the country's major healthcare concern has shifted to the disparity in care between the poor and non-poor, as well as between rural and urban populations. Another unique factor is the presence of indigenous health beliefs, which continue to be widespread in modern society. Gran Sello de la Rep√∫blica del Per√∫ History Before the arrival of Spanish conquistadors in the early 1500s, the population of the Inca Empire which covered five countries - Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, northern and central Chile, northwest Argentina - is estimated at between 9 million and 16 million people. The Andean people had been isolated for millennia and therefore had no reason to build up any sort of immunity against foreign diseases. This meant that the introduction of a non-native population had the potential to spell disaster for the Andeans. Even before Francisco Pizarro arrived on the coast of Peru, the Spaniards had spread diseases such as smallpox, malaria, typhus, influenza, and the common cold to the people of South America. Forty years after the arrival of European explorers and conquistadors, Peru‚Äôs native population had decreased by about 80%. Population recovery was made almost impossible by the killer pandemics that occurred approximately every ten years. Additionally, the stress caused by war, exploitation, socioeconomic change, and psychological trauma caused by the conquests was enough to further weaken the indigenous people and render recovery impossible. Health in Peru today In many ways, health in Peru has been improving. In 2010, the World Health Organization collected data about the life expectancy of people living in Peru. It found that, on average, life expectancy for men at birth is 74 years, while for women it is 77. These values are higher than the global averages of 66 and 71 years, respectively. The mortality rate of this population has been decreasing steadily since 1990 and now stands at 19 deaths per 1000 live births. Regardless of this improvement, health in Peru still faces some challenges today. Marginalized groups, such as individuals living in rural areas and indigenous populations, are especially at risk for health related issues.  Healthcare system  Peru has a decentralized healthcare system that consists of a combination of governmental and non-governmental coverage. Health care is covered by the Ministry of Health, EsSalud, the Armed Forces (FFAA), and National Police (PNP), as well private insurance companies. The Ministry of Health insures 60% of the population and EsSalud covers another 30%. The remaining population in Peru is insured by a combination of the FFAA, PNP, and private insurance companies.  Current issues  * The risk of infectious disease in Peru is considered to be very high. Common ailments include waterborne bacterial diseases, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, dengue fever, malaria, yellow fever, and leptospirosis. * In the population under five years of age, common causes of death are congenital anomalies, prematurity, injuries, pneumonia, birth asphyxia, neonatal sepsis, diarrhea, and HIV/AIDS. The mortality rate of this population has been decreasing steadily since 1990 and now stands at 19 deaths per 1000 live births. *Demand for health workers in Peru has increased over time. The number of health workers per area is not evenly distributed, and many rural areas lack the amount of health workers they need. The country has been working to solve this problem by incentivizing health care providers to remain in rural areas, however this has yet to solve the issue *Climate change also has a significant impact on the quality of health in Peru today. Small changes in climate allow for the vectors that spread diseases like dengue and yellow fever to thrive. Deforestation that contributes to climate change may also be a factor, as it allows more carriers of pathogens to move between previously unaffected areas.  Indigenous health  Indigenous populations in Peru generally face worse health risks than other populations in the country. One source of this issue is access to health facilities. Health facilities are often a large distance away from indigenous communities and are difficult to access. Many indigenous communities within Peru are located in areas that have little land transportation. This hinders the indigenous population's ability to access care facilities. Distance along with financial constraints act as deterrents from seeking medical help. Furthermore, the Peruvian government has yet to devote significant amounts of resources to improving the quality and access to care in rural areas. Traditional medicine is widely used in indigenous populations and it is debated whether this is a factor in the quality of health in these communities. The indigenous groups of the Peruvian Amazon practice traditional medicine and healing at an especially high rate; Traditional medicine is more affordable and accessible than other alternatives and has cultural significance. It has been argued that the use of traditional medicine may keep indigenous populations from seeking help for diseases such as tuberculosis, however this has been disproven. While some indigenous individuals choose to practice traditional medicine before seeking help from a medical professional, this number is negligible and the use of traditional medicine does not seem to prevent indigenous groups seeking medical attention.

It is further classified as a band cup, a type of Little-Master cup. Description This terracotta band cup, or kylix, is 16.4 cm high and has a diameter of 28.4 cm. At present, it is exhibited in Gallery 155 (Greek Art: Sixth Century B.C.) at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The band serves as a miniature frieze, on one side showing the return of Hephaistos to Olympus, and on the other the wine god Dionysus with his wife, Ariadne. Dionysus is indicated by his holding of a band cup, his long beard, and the thyrsus appearing staff or ivy vine. Ariadne has a shared gaze with Dionysus on the side featuring their encounter, and is the only female depicted wearing a mantle. In the other side of the cup, Hephaistos is depicted on his mule, or horse, being led by Dionysus, just as in the archaic story. The mule is shown to have an erect penis and all of the satyrs are depicted with obnoxiously long, erect penises, adding toward the theme of sexual excitement and celebration. Such themes were commonly seen on band cups used in symposiums. Both of these main scenes are surrounded by satyrs and maenads, who are depicted in a rhythmic dance. Detail of the Satyr facing the viewer. A single figure stares at the viewer of the artwork; it is a satyr that can be found behind Hephaistos' mule. The outwardly facing satyr invites the viewer to become a participant in the scene of dancing maenads, which were similar to girls who could be seen dancing at a party. The on looking satyr is a common element in subsequent versions 'Return of Hepaistos' artworks, as can be seen in similarly depicted works, such as the column krater ascribed to Lydos.  Function  The band cup is often depicted with imagery of Dionysus and served as a vessel used to hold wine at parties. Exploiting the circumstance in which band cups would exclusively be used, the imagery acts as encouragement, in addition to the wine, to engage in similar acts in the real world.  Interpretation  This band cup shows an uninhibited procession, a common depiction of Dionysian myth. Author Mary Moore discusses the importance of the viewer facing Satyr, being that it brings attention to the scene of Hephaistos and Dionysus, in which these two figures have their gazes fixated on each other which reflects the significance of their interaction. Author Anne Mackay elaborates on the decision artists who chose to depict outwardly facing figures as not simply a traditional motif, but as technique to direct viewer's attention and in which connected the world the artist's figure inhabits to the real world of the viewer. Furthermore, the outwardly facing satyr invites the viewer to become a participant in the scene of dancing maenads, which were similar to girls who could be seen dancing at a party. The gaze of the outwardly facing figure is a classic example of breaking the fourth wall, and the gaze often urges the viewer to share the figure's emotion.

The majority of the alm cottages are now used as vacation and tourist facilities. History It was first mentioned in 1489. The name has probably a phytonymic origin. The plain was known to tourists in the 19th century as a point on the path to Triglav. A number of Slovene fiction works use Uskovnica as a setting. Before the World War II there was a hotel. Monument to the victims of Nazi aggression on Uskovnica, Geopedia On November 11th 1944 500 Germans attacked the Jesenice-Bohinj partisan troops settled at Uskovnica. The partisans escaped after short shooting. Janez Oblak (44), a permanent Uskovnica resident, was shot by German soldiers at the entrance into his house and thrown into flames. A monument to 4 victims of Uskovnica has been set close to the abandoned sirarna (cheese cottage). German troops burnt 150 cottages, stalls and haybarns at Uskovnica and took away 40 cows and oxen. Tourism After World War II Uskovnica was rebuilt. Some town people bought the ruins where they put up their summer facilities. The mountaineering association of Bohinj built a mountain guest house in 1955.

He was engaged to Nancy Mitford. Early life James Alexander Wedderburn nicknamed \\"Hamish\\" was the son of James St Clair-Erskine, 5th Earl of Rosslyn (1869‚Äì1939). His siblings were Mary St Clair-Erskine Dunn Campbell McCabe Dunn (1912‚Äì1993), Rosabelle St Clair-Erskine (1891‚Äì1956) and Francis St Clair-Erskine, Lord Loughborough (1892‚Äì1929). At Eton College, St Clair-Erskine was the lover of Tom Mitford. He attended Oxford University, where he was friends with English poet Sir John Betjeman. In the Letters edited by Betjeman's daughter, Candida Lycett Green, and published in 1996, she remembers how her father and St. Clair-Erskine \\"went out in fast cars, driving all night in the flat country near Coolham\\". According to James Lees-Milne's diaries: \\"At Oxford he had the most enchanting looks ‚Äì mischievous, twinkling eyes, slanting eyebrows. He was slight of build, well dressed, gay as gay, always snobbish however, and terribly conscious of his nobility [...] the toast of the university.\\" At Oxford he was friends with Evelyn Waugh. Career He fought in the World War II, became a Major in the Coldstream Guards, escaping from a prison camp and walking through Italy to join the Allied troops. He was awarded a Military Cross in 1943. In 1969, together with Anthony Rhodes, he translated Tapestries by Mercedes Viale Ferrero. He was the dame de compagnie to Daisy Fellowes and Enid Kenmare. Personal life Hamish St. Clair-Erskine was gay, but nevertheless, Nancy Mitford fell in love with him, and it was due to this unrequited love that she attempted suicide and wrote her first novel, Highland Fling: the male lead is based upon St. Clair-Erskine. In the 1920s he was friends with Aileen Sibell Mary Guinness and the Hon. Brinsley Sheridan Bushe Plunket and was guest to their residence, the Luttrellstown Castle, County Dublin. He was good friends with Patrick Leigh Fermor and his wife Joan: in the 1940s the three of them drove down through France and Italy, and later, Joan accompanied Peter Quennell and St. Clair-Erskine to Sicily, where she was to take the photographs of an article Quennell was writing. At St. Clair- Erskine's death in 1973, Alan Payan Pryce-Jones described him as a \\"bright apparition who once upon a time swept past them like a kingfisher: all colour and sparkle and courage [...] [he found] small place in a world which turned away from an unambitious charmer whose only enduring gift was his charm\\".

Highway networks use learned gating mechanisms to regulate information flow, inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. The gating mechanisms allow neural networks to have paths for information to follow across different layers (\\"information highways\\"). Highway networks have been used as part of text sequence labeling and speech recognition tasks.  Model  The model has two gates in addition to the H(WH, x) gate: the transform gate T(WT, x) and the carry gate C(WC, x). Those two last gates are non-linear transfer functions (by convention Sigmoid function). The H(WH, x) function can be any desired transfer function. The carry gate is defined as C(WC, x) = 1 - T(WT, x). While the transform gate is just a gate with a sigmoid transfer function.  Structure  The structure of a hidden layer follows the equation: begin{align} y = H(x,W_{H}) centerdot T(x,W_{T}) + x centerdot C(x,W_{C}) = H(x,W_{H}) centerdot T(x,W_{T}) + x centerdot (1 - T(x,W_{T})) end{align} The advantage of a Highway Network over the common deep neural networks is that solves or prevents partially the Vanishing gradient problem, thus leading to easier to optimize neural networks.

Forcepoint was founded in 1994 as an information technology reseller called NetPartners. It was renamed Websense in 1999 and became a public company in 2000 at the peak of the dot-com bubble. Vista Equity Partners acquired Websense in 2013 for $906 million. Raytheon acquired an 80% interest in Websense in April 2015 for $1.9 billion and acquired the remaining 20% interest in 2019. In 2015, Websense acquired network security vendor Stonesoft from Intel and in 2016, the company was renamed Forcepoint. Corporate history NetPartners The company was founded in 1994 as NetPartners in Sorrento Valley, San Diego by Phil Trubey. The company began as a reseller for network security products, then developed software for controlling Internet use by employees. In 1998, NetPartners raised $6 million in venture capital funding and had $6 million in annual revenue. Later that year, investors pushed Trubey out of the CEO position and appointed John Carrington as his replacement. Websense In June 1999, NetPartners was renamed Websense. In March 2000, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, Websense raised $72 million in an initial public offering. The stock price doubled on its first day of trading. In 2006, former McAfee CEO Gene Hodges succeeded Carrington as chief executive officer of the company. Also in 2006, Websense acquired a fingerprint security company called PortAuthority for $90 million. In October 2007, the company acquired email security vendor SurfControl for $400 million. In 2009, Websense acquired Defensio, a spam and malware company focused on social media. By 2009, Websense had 1,400 employees, with offices in England, China, Australia, and Israel. In 2011, Facebook deployed Websense to check every link users shared on the site. In 2013, Vista Equity Partners acquired the company for $906 million. Websense headquarters were moved to San Diego that year and to Austin, Texas in 2014. In 2015, Raytheon acquired cybersecurity firm Websense, Inc. from Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion and combined it with RCP, formerly part of its IIS segment to form RaytheonWebsense. In October 2015, RaytheonWebsense acquired Foreground Security, a provider of security operations centers, managed security service solutions and cybersecurity professional services, for $62 million. Forcepoint Raytheon acquired an 80% interest in Websense in May 2015 for about $1.9 billion. In October 2015, the company acquired Stonesoft and Sidewinder from Intel for $389 million. Stonesoft was a network security product previously known as \\"McAfee Next-Generation Firewall;\\" Sidewinder was a firewall previously known as McAfee Firewall Enterprise. In January 2016, the three companies were combined and rebranded as \\"Forcepoint\\". The new company also included Raytheon's \\"Cyber Products\\" business. At the time, Forcepoint had 2,000 employees, with one-third of its customers being departments in the federal government of the United States. Forcepoint became the smallest of five major businesses owned by Raytheon, but had the highest profit margin. The following year, Forcepoint began shuffling executives in a re-organization effort that included some layoffs. The company was divided into four business units: Cloud Security, Network Security, Data & Insider Threat Security, and Global Governments. In April 2016, Matthew Moynahan was appointed chief executive officer of Forcepoint. In February 2017, Forcepoint acquired a cloud-based access broker (CASB) security product from Imperva called Skyfence. In August 2017, Forcepoint acquired user and entity behavior analytics company RedOwl. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Raytheon acquired the remaining 20% of the company from Vista Ventures Partners LLC for $588 million.

Version 3.0 introduced the software's first graphical, web-based administrative user interface. At the time, Forcepoint's software was only used to prevent employees from viewing certain types of content at work, but in 2006 features were added to detect when employees were attempting to visit websites suspected of hosting malicious code. In 2007 Websense introduced a product to control content a user can see on social media websites, an endpoint security product, a website reputation ranker, and a small business version. Additionally, a product was added to the Websense suite that identifies sensitive files in un-secure locations on the corporate network and looks for records of those files being transmitted. Websense introduced its first appliance product in 2009. In 2010, some products were consolidated into the Triton software, which became responsible for increasingly large portions of the company's revenue. In February 2012, Forcepoint released a cloud-based suite of IT security products for smartphones, tablets, laptops, USB drives, and other mobile devices. Upgrades to the suite in 2012 added the ability to identify confidential information in an image file. Three new products or revisions were introduced in 2016, all focused on security risks caused by employees. Censorship Forcepoint has a policy against selling to governments and ISPs that engage in Internet censorship, however it has been criticized for a \\"perceived link to censorship of free speech and the dissemination of knowledge.\\" In 2009, it was discovered that the Yemeni government was using Forcepoint's products to monitor the public's internet use and block tools that allow citizens to hide their internet use from the government and the software Alkasir was created to circumvent it. Forcepoint responded by cutting off the country's access to Forcepoint's database updates. In 2011, Forcepoint said it would join the Global Network Initiative, which is focused on privacy and Internet freedom. It left the initiative in 2014. A 2002 study in JAMA found that Forcepoint had the best-performing web-filtering products in terms of blocking pornography while allowing health information. In contrast, a 2005 report by the Rhode Island branch of the American Civil Liberties Union said Forcepoint is a \\"blunt instrument\\" and that in public libraries equipped with Forcepoint people of all ages \\"are still denied access to a wide range of legitimate material.\\" A 2006 report by Brennan Center for Justice found that Forcepoint often blocked websites that discussed pornography, but did not actually feature pornography. Forcepoint software also blocked a furniture website called \\"the-strippers.com \\", which is not pornographic, and instead a website for a furniture refinisher. In the author's study, 0-15 percent of the sites blocked by Forcepoint should have been viewable by the user and 10 percent of objectionable websites were let through, rather than blocked. According to blogger Jillian York, Forcepoint blocks pages that contain pornographic links anywhere in its content, even in the comments section. He said \\"a malicious attacker could get your whole site blocked at any time by the simple procedure of leaving dangerous, malicious or pornographic links in a blog's comments\\". For approximately 15 minutes in 2009, Forcepoint classified router company Cisco Systems's website under 'hack sites'. Due to one of Cisco's IP addresses being named on a hacker website. The IP address was reviewed, and deemed not a threat.

Throughout his life, he served the nation in a number of capacities such as; politician, journalist & officer. He served as an aide-de-camp in the army in Algeria and the Crimea, then entered politics and was a member of the Corps l√©gislatif during the Second French Empire. He was briefly Minister of Public Works at the outbreak of the Franco- Prussian War of 1870. Early years J√©r√¥me David was born in Rome, Italy, on 30 June 1823, nominal grandson of the painter Jacques-Louis David, and godson of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, King of Westphalia and Catharina of W√ºrttemberg, his wife. He was the natural son of King J√©r√¥me. His family destined him for the navy, where he served from 1835 to 1837, but he took a dislike to this service and chose to join the army instead. He graduated from the √âcole de Saint-Cyr on 1 October 1844 as second lieutenant of the Zouaves. David was in turn an aide to General Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac, head of the bureau arabe at Lalla Maghnia on the Moroccan frontier, aide to General Paul de Ladmirault, aide to General Jacques Louis Randon the governor-general of Algeria, and finally commanding officer of the Beni-Massour circle in Kabylie. In 1853 he married Jeanne C√©cile Elisa Merle of Langon, Gironde. In 1853‚Äì55 he was an aide to his brother, Prince Napol√©on Bonaparte, whom he followed in the Crimean War. David was made a captain of the 21st line regiment in 1854. He returned with the prince to France when the prince's physical and moral condition no longer allowed him to stay with the army. He resigned from the army in 1857. Political career Second French Empire In 1854, David was elected Mayor of Langon and general councilor of the Gironde for the canton of Saint- Symphorien. He ran for election to the legislature for the 3rd constituency of Gironde on 22 June 1857 but was defeated. He ran again on 1 May 1859, for the 4th constituency of Gironde, La R√©ole, and was elected. He sat with the dynastic majority, and spoke in favour of free trade on the eve of the Treaty of Commerce with England. David was reelected on 1 June 1863 for the 4th constituency of Gironde. He continued to support the Emperor's personal policy. For three successive years, he served in the capacity of the secretary of the Corps l√©gislatif. The Emperor Napoleon III appointed David Vice- President of the Corps l√©gislatif for the sessions of 1867, 1868 and 1869. HeHe was active in debates, with uncompromising conservative view Whenen he was reappointed Vice-President in June 1869, this was seen as a promise to the reactionary party, and President Eug√®ne Schneider submitted his resignation. Schneider agreed to remain only at the personal request of the emperor. David was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor in August 1864 and Grand Officer on 19 June 1869. David was reelected for the 6th constituency of Gironde on 24 May 1869. He opposed the ministry of √âmile Ollivier. He spoke against the Hohenzolern candidacy for the Spanish throne, and was one of the strongest supporters of the declaration of war against Prussia in 1870. After the Ollivier cabinet fell on 10 August 1870, he was made Minister of Public Works in the Palikao cabinet. David announced the defeat at the Battle of Sedan to the Senate, and declared \\"Paris will not capitulate, and, if necessary, we will be buried under its ruins.\\" The next day, on 4 September 1870, he returned to private life. French Second Republic After a short exile in Great Britain in which he was one of the main correspondents of Louis- Napoleon, David attempted to return to politics. On 2 July 1871, he ran for reelection as deputy for the Gironde but was defeated. Strongly affected by the disappearance of his two children in 1872, and then by the death of Louis Napoleon, he seemed tempted to abandon politics. However, on 6 October 1874 he was elected to the general council for the canton of Langon. He was reelected to Parliament for Bazas on 5 March 1876, after a campaign based on defending the achievements of the Empire and denouncing the Republic. He sat with the Appel au peuple group. He supported Albert de Broglie against the 363. David was beaten in Langon in the municipal elections of February 1877. He was reelected as deputy as an official candidate on 18 October 1877. The Republican majority invalidated this election, but he was reelected on 7 July 1878 and continued to vote with the Bonapartists. He gave up the political struggle after the death of the Prince Imperial. He did not defend his seat in the cantonal elections of 1880 or the legislative elections of 1881. He died on 27 January 1882 in Langon. His entire fortune was a house, valued at 15,000 francs.

The attack has been attributed to the Glenanne gang Background Since at least 5 August 1969, loyalists had been planting bombs across the Irish border in the Republic, most of them had been planted by the Ulster Volunteer Force, a few had been planted by the Ulster Freedom Fighters of the UDA, and at least one by the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). These early bombs were small and only did small structural damage to a certain target. The worst of these bombings happened in May 1974 when 34 people were killed and 300 injured in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. On 14 February 1976, a month before the bomb at Castleblayney, a UVF bomb exploded in the main street of the small border town of Swanlinbar in County Cavan. There were no injuries.http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/violence/docs/kaystavern0706.pdf Bombing At around 8.20 pm a car bomb, for which no warning had been given, exploded outside the Three Star Inn in Castleblayney, killing 56 year-old Patrick (Packie) Mone instantly. Patrick had a wife called Anna and was a bicycle-mechanic. Despite prompt medical attention, he died on his way to hospital in the ambulance. Additionally, 17 people were injured in the blast which caused much damage in the immediate vicinity. Loyalist and Glenanne gang member John Weir claimed Mone was not the intended target, the 8.20 pm Derry- Dublin bus which usually ran like clock-work was the intended target but it was late by about two minutes. Weir also claimed that the attack was carried out by RUC officer Laurence McClure and UDR soldier Robert McConnell, using explosives provided by UDR Captain John Irwin and stored beforehand at James Mitchell's farmhouse. A memorial to Patrick Mone was erected near the site of the bombing in Castleblayney.Cassel Report (2006), p. 53 After the bombing On the 17 March, 10 days after the Castleblaney bombing, the Glenanne gang carried out another car bomb attack in the Hillcrest Bar bombing which killed four more people (including two 13 year olds) and injured 50.

Its original purpose was to assist Italian veterans of World War I, and later, needy Italian residents of New York City. Today the League raises funds for a variety of charitable purposes, such as medical research.  History  After World War I, a group of Italian-American women organized the Italian Committee of the American Red Cross. Originally its purpose was to assist the riservisti, veterans who had returned to the U.S. after fighting in the Italian army. It soon became clear that there was a general need for their services in the Italian neighborhoods in New York, where thousands of residents were mired in poverty, had little education, and were not fluent in English. To address these larger issues, the group met in May 1920 and formed the Italian Welfare League (IWL). Among the founding members were Margherita de Vecchi, Paola Berizzi, Elizabeth T. Bava, and Carolina Allen Perera, who served as the League's first president. Perera's husband, banker Lionello Perera, also played an important role in the founding of the female-dominated organization. The IWL had offices in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Ellis Island. At the Ellis Island office, they assisted Italians who were having trouble with immigration, including hundreds who were detained on the island during World War II. The league helped Italian New Yorkers find jobs, housing, and medical care, and provided emergency aid to the needy. In response to the Americanization Movement, they helped Italian immigrants learn to speak English and conform to the social norms of Anglo-Saxon Protestant America. From 1934 to 1973, executive secretary Angela Carlozzi Rossi oversaw much of the league's activity, in addition to handling many cases personally. In 1945, league members created the Godparents Committee for Italian War Orphans, which provided food, clothing, money, and medicine for orphaned children in Italy. The following year they created a Port and Dock Committee to help Italian immigrants get through customs. The IWL also helped reunite family members who had been separated during the war. Since the 1960s, as the needs of Italian immigrants have become less pressing, the IWL has turned its attention to raising funds for medical research, hospitals, nursing homes, and scholarships to students seeking advanced degrees in social services.  Present Day  In 2001, the Italian Welfare League was revived and began to focus on serving the needs of Italian American children with special needs, or who had suffered from trauma. The League holds an annual luncheon to raise funds and has donated more than $2,000,000 to children and families in need since 2002.

Simon has led four businesses and has served on the boards of several leading Maryland non-profits. He was the CEO of Bronfman Rothschild, which managed $6.1 billion, until its sale in May 2019. From 2006 to 2008, Simon was the chairman of the board of the Montgomery County Community Foundation and in 2016 Simon was elected chairman of the board of the Greater Washington Community Foundation. In April 2016, Simon and his family were recognized by Interfaith Works as Humanitarians of the Year. In 2018, Simon ran as an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maryland on a politically centrist platform. Though he at one point polled as high as 18%, he ultimately earned less than 4% of the vote. Simon is the author of Contract to Unite America: Ten Reforms to Reclaim Our Republic. Early life and education Simon was born in New York City, the middle child of Donald Simon and Sylvia Abitbol Simon. At a young age, his family moved to North Woodmere, New York, while his father worked in equipment leasing and his mother worked as a school teacher then a travel agent. In 1986, Simon graduated from George W. Hewlett High School, where he served as class president for three years. Donald Simon was from Brooklyn, NY and is the son of immigrants from Belarus. Simon's mother, Sylvia Abitbol, was born in Casablanca, Morocco. In 1986, Simon began his studies at Brown University. He also attended the Sorbonne (Universite de Paris) for the summer semester. While at Brown University, Simon attended Tel Aviv University for the spring semester of his junior year, and he spent two summers working for Neuberger Berman in New York, NY. In 1990, he graduated from Brown University with a BA cum laude in Applied Mathematics and Economics. His senior thesis evaluated the impact on Palestinians of work in Israel. Between stints at William Kent International, Simon attended University of Chicago Graduate School of Business where in 1995 he received a Master of Business Administration high honors (top 5% of class). Upon graduation, in recognition largely for his starting and running the business school's Public Service Fellowship program, Simon received the President's Award for Student Volunteer Service. While at University of Chicago, Simon attended Universidad Catolica in Santiago, Chile, for one trimester. During the summer of 1994, he worked for the World Bank in Washington, DC. Business career Simon worked for William Kent International (WKI) from 1990 to 1993 and again from 1995 to 1999. WKI specialized in helping large US corporations build their businesses overseas. Simon's clients included Alcoa, Rockwell, Kennametal, and Rubbermaid. During his time at WKI, he worked in over 30 countries and ultimately became the firm's COO. Simon also served on the Board of the company's joint venture in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1999, Simon left WKI to become chairman and CEO of USLaw, a national network of small law firms. USLaw was financed with $15 million led by UBS Capital, and the website USLaw.com quickly became the leader for consumers and small businesses researching their legal issues. The company gained notoriety for its offering online chats with attorneys. At its peak in 2000, the company employed 96. In November 2000, the company laid off 16 of its 96 people in a business restructuring. In late 2001, in the midst of the bursting of the tech bubble, USLaw was sold to Grand Central Holdings in New York City. In October 2000, Simon was recognized by Washington Business Forward as one of the top 40 business leaders under the age of 40 and in December 2000 he appeared on the cover of Money magazine. After leaving USLaw in 2001, Simon joined the Meltzer Group as its president and COO. In 2002, Simon started a registered investment advisor which four years later became Highline Wealth Management. By 2015, the company managed $1.5 billion and was one of the fifty largest registered investment advisers in the country. On July 31, 2015, Highline was acquired by Bronfman Rothschild. The Washington Post estimated the acquisition price at $30 million. As part of the transaction, Bronfman Rothschild moved its headquarters to Rockville, Maryland, and Simon was hired as chief executive officer. Simon's new partners included Sir Evelyn Rothschild and Matthew Bronfman. In 2015, Simon appeared on the cover of Charles Schwab‚Äôs Portraits of Independence, a collection of success stories in investment management. In January 2016, along Matthew Bronfman, Simon appeared on the cover of Financial Advisor magazine. In October 2017, Simon appeared on the cover of Financial Planning magazine, for an article featuring the company's growth. In July 2016, Bronfman Rothschild was recognized by Financial Advisor Magazine as the second-fastest growing investment advisory in the country. In August 2017, Simon hired Michael LaMena as president and COO, creating a new position in the company's leadership team. On March 26, 2019, Bronfman Rothschild announced its sale to NFP Corp. The sale was closed in May 2019, and Simon elected not to be part of the new company. During Simon's 17-year tenure as CEO, the company had grown every year.  2018 campaign for U.S. Senate  On February 6, 2018, Simon declared his candidacy to represent the state of Maryland in the U.S. Senate as an independent. Three weeks after the campaign launch, Unite America, a grassroots political organization that advocates for the statewide election of independent candidates, announced their formal endorsement of Simon, Governor Bill Walker (I-AK), Greg Orman, Terry Hayes, and Craig O‚ÄôDear. During the first quarter of 2018, Simon's fundraising matched that raised by incumbent Ben Cardin. On July 19, 2018, Simon submitted over 12,000 signatures to complete Maryland's state requirement for nomination by petition so he could be included on the ballot. Among Simon's signers was Governor Larry Hogan. Simon endorsed Maryland Governor Larry Hogan for re-election and said that Hogan told had him that he had voted for Simon. On Monday, September 24, Simon's campaign held a rally with Isaac Slade, the lead singer of The Fray, which was Slade's first solo performance.  General election debate  On Sunday, October 7, Simon participated in a debate against Senator Ben Cardin and Republican candidate Tony Campbell. At the debate, Simon criticized Cardin for \\"failing to solve a range of problems during 52 years in public office\\", saying that he wants voters to be able to see ‚Äúwhat a different government could look like, and what it might look like if we didn‚Äôt just have a senator following his party 97 percent of the time.‚Äù In response to a question about Baltimore's education system, Simon had some of his harshest criticisms. Simon also made his case against overt partisanship in the Senate, saying ‚ÄúI think the Steelers and Ravens are nicer to each other than the people in the United States Senate.\\" In his closing statement, Simon called for two more debates, which were never scheduled.  General election  In an October Gonzales Research poll, Simon polled at 18% in the three-way race and had an overwhelming lead among undecided voters over his Democrat and Republican opponents. In mid-October, Simon suspended advertising and stopped actively fundraising. On November 6, Simon received 84,453 votes for 3.7% of the vote in the general election.  2020 book release  In January, 2020, Simon‚Äôs book Contract to Unite America: Ten Reforms to Reclaim Our Republic was published through RealClear Publishing. In the book, Simon explores the root causes for political gridlock in national politics, and unveils ten reform prescriptions to create incentives for politicians to work together on behalf of the American people. Cindy McCain, wife of the late-Senator John McCain praised the book, saying: ‚Äú My husband always put country ahead of party, and he would be proud to know that other mavericks out there are still doing the same. Contract to Unite America makes a compelling case for reforms that were dear to John: not only campaign finance reform and bipartisan administrations, but also enriched civics education and expanded national service.‚Äù CNN and Sirius XM politics host Michael Smerconish wrote in his review, \\"Whenever I speak about the dysfunction in our politics, which is often, I am asked for solutions. Here at last is what I can recommend. Neal Simon has written a thoughtful, well-sourced, and truly independent prescription for what ails America. This is the book our elected officials hope you never read.‚Äùhttps://www.amazon.com/Contract-Unite-America-Reforms- Republic/dp/1645430642/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=neal+simon&qid;=1579619931&sr;=8-1 In a review in Real Clear Politics, Morton Kondracke wrote that Simon \\"has written a dazzlingly effective analysis of what‚Äôs wrong with our politics and has compiled the best list of specific changes I‚Äôve encountered in several years of covering America‚Äôs growing political reform movement....His book is also well-written, clear, forceful, deeply researched, and filled with historical background tales.\\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/02/18/neal_simons_roadmap_out_of_our_partisan_morass_142424.html The book also received praise from Frank Luntz, Michael E. Porter, Jason Altmire, Glenn Nye, Nancy Jacobson, and Evan McMullin.  Political positions and affiliations  Neal Simon identifies himself as a \\"moderate independent.\\" In the 2018 campaign, he described his fiscal positions as being closer to that of the Republican platform and his social positions as closer to those of the Democratic platform. He supports lower taxes, and advocates strongly for responsible fiscal management of the federal budget, including reducing federal debt. Simon supports same-sex marriage, maintaining the legality of abortion, and universal background checks for gun purchases. On his Senate campaign site, Simon favors a compromise solution for immigration, including tighter border security, nationalizing the E-Verify program, and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants that have been in the country for many years. One of Simon's stated primary objectives was to bring the country together. Simon advocates several reforms to our political system that are designed to improve the functioning of our democracy. Simon supports open primaries, which would allow independent voters to participate in Maryland's primary elections, a system believed to result in more moderate representatives. Simon supports the elimination of gerrymandering for political advantage. He favors either mathematical algorithms or independent commissions to draw congressional districts. Simon supports the mandatory release of tax returns by both the President and the Vice President, and he is an advocate for term limits.

Navarro, 579 U.S. ___ (2016), 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a Supreme Court of the United States case addressing overtime pay. Specifically at issue is whether automotive service advisors are eligible for overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The case had been heard twice by the Supreme Court. In the first pass, the Court had vacated a previous decision by the Ninth Circuit Appeals Court which relied on an interpretive ruling on the Fair Labor Standards Act provided by the United States Department of Labor to states that service advisors were not exempt, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit.. On rehearing, the Ninth Circuit still found the same; its decision was reversed in the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling.. Facts and prior history Respondents are \\"service advisors\\" at Mercedes-Benz of Encino (California). Their primary job responsibilities involve identifying service needs and selling service solutions to the dealership's customers. Respondents brought suit against the dealership under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), seeking time-and-a-half overtime pay for working more than 40 hours per week. The FLSA exempts from its overtime requirements \\"any salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.\\" The district court denied the claims, concluding that a service advisor is a \\"salesman . . . engaged in ... servicing automobiles\\" and therefore exempt from the FLSA's overtime requirements. The Ninth Circuit reversed, citing a 2011 Department of Labor interpretive regulation stating that service advisors are not exempt under ¬ß213(b)(10)(A) because they do not personally service automobiles. This finding was contrary for findings from the Fourth and Fifth Circuits, several district courts, and the Supreme Court of Montana,\\" all of which held that service advisors are exempt employees. First Supreme Court opinion Encino petitioned to the Supreme Court, who granted certiorari, and heard the case on April 20, 2016. The Court ruled on June 20, 2016, giving a 6-2 decision to vacate the Ninth District's decision and remanded the case back to that court. The majority decision was provided by Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Justices Roberts, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. Kennedy's opinion focused on whether the 2011 DOL regulation qualified for the \\"Chevron deference\\", defined by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. and which states that courts must defer to regulations made by the appropriate administrative agency granted powers by Congress on some matters. Kennedy stated that past cases related to the Chevron deference, such as FCC v. Fox (2009) and National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services (2005), determined that this deference is only allowable when agencies make these regulations with \\"good reasons for the new policy\\"; the 2011 DOL policy change, the Court determined, was a complete change from a 1978 DOL policy, and the DOL did not provide adequete rationale for its change. As such, the Court ruled that the Ninth could not consider the 2011 DOL ruling as part of its decision. Kennedy's decision otherwise did not rule on the other merits of the case. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Alito. In the dissent, Thomas agreed that the 2011 DOL ruling did not enjoy the Chevron deference, but believed that the Supreme Court should evaluate the other merits of the case at that time, and in his opinion, the FLSA should be read to have service advisers as exempt from overtime as they are \\"primarily engaged in ... servicing automobiles\\", and suggested reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision on this basis. Remand to Ninth Circuit The Ninth Circuit still found against Encino during the rehearing, ruling that the service advisors were not exempt, basing their decision primarily on the legislative history of FLSA. Second Supreme Court opinion Encino again appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in September 2017. The case provides the unusual example of the same case being heard a second time, allowing a view into the new court's attitude toward federal rulemaking. The Court heard oral arguments January 17, 2018. The court issued its ruling on April 2, 2018, in a 5-4 decision that reversed the Ninth Circuit and affirmed that service advisors are to be considered exempt under FLSA. The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas joined by Justices Roberts, Alito, Kennedy, and Gorsuch, while Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the dissenting opinion joined by Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.

Biography Balfour was the second son of judge Sir James Balfour, Lord Pittendreich, and Margaret Balfour, daughter and heiress of James Balfour of Burleigh Castle. His elder brother, Michael, was created Lord Balfour of Burleigh in 1609. (Baron Balfour of Glenawley is sometimes identified as the second son of the first Lord Balfour of Burleigh, but this appears to be an error.) In 1573, James Balfour received in fee a charter for the lands at Costertoun in the lordship of Musselburgh from Robert Pitcairn, commendator of Dunfermline Abbey. In 1599, he was styled as feuar of Pitcullo. Balfour was a favourite of James VI and was knighted at some point. By 1617, he was referred to as Sir James Balfour of Pitcullo. Along with James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn and Andrew Stuart, 1st Baron Castle Stuart, Balfour was among the most important of the ennobled \\"undertakers\\" ‚Äî the English and Scots tasked with the colonisation of Ulster. Balfour was the largest planter in Fermanagh; in addition to the lands he received from the crown, he also purchased lands from his elder brother Lord Burleigh, also an undertaker. By 1641, his lands in the baronies of Knockninny and Magherastephana covered 8,275 acres (7,520 of which were turning a profit). Sir James purchased his brother's land in Fermanagh by deed dated 7 January 1615. The land included Lisnaskea, where around 1620, he began construction on Castle Balfour. On 8 November 1619, Balfour was created Baron Balfour of Glenawley (a Scoticisation of Clanawley) of Fermanagh, in the Peerage of Ireland. The title became extinct upon the death of his younger son, the third Baron (who had succeeded his elder brother), in 1636. The lordship of Glenawley was revived in 1661 for Hugh Hamilton, 1st Baron of Glenawley, whose wife, Arabella Susan Balfour of Pitcullo, was also a relative, a daughter of a Sir William Balfour, and a nephew of Lord Balfour's daughter Anne. His uncle Michael Balfour of Mountwhanny, Commendator of Melrose Abbey, was the ancestor of the Balfours of Orkney. His younger brother William Balfour, who also settled in Ireland, was the ancestor of the Townley- Balfour family of Townley Hall, County Louth. Marriage and issue Lord Balfour married three times. He married firstly a cousin, Grizel Balfour, daughter of Patrick Balfour and Katherine Ramsay, by whom he had three sons and three daughters. After 1599 he married secondly Lady Elizabeth Leslie, daughter of George Hay, 7th Earl of Erroll and Helen Bryson, who had divorced her first husband, Sir John Leslie, 10th Baron of Balquhain, for adultery shortly after their marriage in 1597. He had three sons and three daughters from his first wife: *James Balfour, 2nd Lord Balfour, Baron of Glenawley (died 16 February 1635), succeeded his father but shortly after decessit sine prole *Alexander Balfour, 3rd Lord Balfour, Baron of Glenawley (died 1636). He married Anne Warren, widow of William Warren and the daughter of Sir Francis Goldsmith of Crayford, Kent. He succeeded his brother but the title became extinct upon his death without an heir. *Pearce, died young *Hon. Anne Balfour, married firstly, Sir John Wemyss, High Sheriff of Fermanagh, who was murdered as part of her father's feud with the Bishop of Clogher. She married, secondly, Archbishop of Cashel Archibald Hamilton, son of Malcolm Hamilton or son of Sir Claude Hamilton. Her nephew Hugh Hamilton was created Lord of Glenawley in 1661. His third wife was Hon. Anne Blayney, eldest daughter of Edward Blayney, 1st Baron Blayney and Anne Loftus, daughter of Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin In the 1620s, Lord Balfour ‚Äî \\"though an ancient man of great adge\\" ‚Äî married the 15-year-old Anne, who brought a dowry of ¬£1,200 (), with the agreement that Anne would be granted jointure lands worth ¬£300. > After the wedding, 'which was done on both sides with more haste than good > speed', Balfour reneged on the marriage settlement on the grounds that > another man 'had abused his wife both before his marriage with her and > after'. Under duress, Anne confessed to her infidelities and a lengthy and > very public lawsuit ensued that threatened to bankrupt her father, Lord > Blayney (something that Balfour had fully intended). The causes that induced > her to accuse herself in a matter of unchastity, to her own and her parent's > dishonour' puzzled the king, who then instructed the two peers to settle the > 'unnatural' dispute without bringing further shame to all concerned. Lord Balfour complained to the King about his dispute with the Blayneys, claiming they were receiving preferential treatment, which led to a feud with James Spottiswood, the Bishop of Clogher. The feud came to a head in 1626 when Lord Balfour's son-in-law Sir John Wemyss was murdered by the bishop's men. All of this was very costly and despite his land holdings, Lord Balfour was financially ruined. In June 1634 sold his estate for a little over ¬£3,000 to Sir William Balfour, keeper of the Tower of London, who was probably his cousin. Lord Balfour died in London in October 1634 and was buried at St Ann Blackfriars (destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666). His will, dated shortly before his death, was proved by probate in Dublin on 5 March 1635 but was probated again the following June. Balfour apparently died intestate and his two sons sued each other and his will was not proved until June 1636, by which at least one of his sons had died.

It was found in October 1979 in the ancient city of Motya (), originally a Phoenician settlement which occupied the island of San Pantaleo off the coast of Sicily. It is owned by, and on view in, the Museo Giuseppe Whitaker (inv. no. 4310) on the same island. Description The marble statue depicts a young male figure in a swinging contraposto pose, with his right foot forward, his left hand resting on his hip, and his right arm raised. He wears a very long chiton, with a broad flat belt over his chest. Two holes once accommodated a metal fitting at the centre of the belt, perhaps a clasp. The figure's musculature, genitals, and posterior are clearly visible; the sculptor managed to create the illusion that they are seen through the sheer fabric of the chiton. Bulging veins are depicted on the upper arms in a rudimentary manner. The figure's face is impassive, with puffy eyelids and almond-shaped eyes. The hair is depicted as three rows of circles, commonly known as \\"snail curls.\\" Above them, the head is a featureless dome. There are small holes around the bottom of the dome, which were probably for pins to secure a metal skull cap or helmet. When the sculpture was toppled in antiquity, both arms were snapped off and lost, as were the legs below the shins. The face is also heavily damaged and the head was snapped off at the neck, but it has been reattached by the archaeologists. Dating The charioteer was found in a stratigraphic layer associated with the destruction of Motya in 397 BC, which provides a terminus ante quem. Several stylistic features make clear that it dates from the 470s BC and is an early example of Classical sculpture. This early date is suggested by the depiction of the hair with rows of snail curls, which is typical of Archaic Greek sculpture, as well as the bulging veins. Such veins were first depicted in sculpture by Pythagoras of Rhegium ca. 480-470 BC, suggesting a date around this time. Moreover, the facial features are similar to those of the figures in the pedimental sculpture of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, which dates to the 460s BC. Subject The subject of the statue is heavily disputed. It clearly belongs within the Greek sculptural tradition, but Motya was a Punic settlement. Which of these two factors should be given preeminence in interpreting the statue is an open question. Scholars who foreground the Punic context of the sculpture have seen it as depicting a Punic priest. In this interpretation, the belt around the figure's chest is compared to a piece of priestly regalia seen in depictions of priests in Punic art. Some go further and see the sculpture specifically as a depiction of Hamilcar I of Carthage, who led the invasion of Sicily that culminated in the Battle of Himera in 480 BC, and is depicted as a priest in Greek literary sources. Image of the Charioteer of Delphi. Scholars such as R. R. R. Smith, who emphasise the Greek artistic context, interpret the sculpture as a depiction of a charioteer celebrating a victory in one of the Panhellenic Games. On this interpretation, the chiton and belt are the chiton poderos or xystis, the traditional costume worn by charioteers - to be compared with that worn by the Charioteer of Delphi. One objection to this interpretation is the starkly different postures of the Motya Charioteer and the Charioteer of Delphi. However, Smith argues that this difference reflects the divergent status of the two charioteers. Usually, the owners of chariots entered in the Panhellenic Games did not drive their own chariots, instead employing professional drivers. Sculptural groups commemorating victories commonly depicted the charioteer, but presented him in an impassive guise and focused attention on a figure of the victorious owner. Some chariots, however, were driven by their owners; examples include Herodotus of Thebes and Thrasybulus of Acragas. In that case, the victorious owner and the charioteer would be one and the same. Smith proposes that the Motya sculpture depicts an owner-charioteer of this type, arguing that \\"the swaggering whole embodied agonistic arete as conceived in the early fifth century BC.\\" Scholars who favour this latter interpretation have tended to explain the charioteer's presence in the Punic settlement of Motya by regarding it as war booty seized from one of the Sicilian Greek centres destroyed in the Carthaginian invasion of Sicily in 410-404 BC. R. R. R. Smith argues that this explanation may not be necessary, given the large Greek population resident in Motya as well as the familiarity of the Punic inhabitants of Motya with Greek culture.  Discovery and archaeological context  The Motya Charioteer was discovered in 1979 in the northeast sector of the island of Motya, while archeologists were excavating an open area between an ancient potters' workshop and a sanctuary. The area was filled with rubble and dirt that may have once formed barricades erected during Dionysius I of Syracuse's siege of Motya in 397 BC. The statue was found lying on its back with its head detached and resting in place, suggesting that the weight of the soil that had buried the statue was responsible for its decapitation. The arms, metal accessories, and base of the statue were not found at the site and remain missing; therefore, it is likely that the statue was not found in its original context. It is possible that the statue was originally displayed in the nearby sanctuary and was knocked down during the Syracusan siege.  References   Sources   Papadopoulos, J.

It has a cosmopolitan distribution. It was first described in 1852 by the Russian/German zoologist August David Krohn who gave it the name Syllis prolifera. Description This small worm grows to a length of about . The two palps are widely separated and the eversible pharynx bears a large tooth near the rim but behind the pharyngeal opening. On the dorsal surface, long and short cirri alternate. The antennae and cirri have dark spots, but the general body colour is variable, being some shade of brown, grey or pink, sometimes with orange or pink speckling near the anterior end. Distribution and habitat S. prolifera is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the northwestern Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, Mozambique and New Zealand. It is present from the lower shore down to the sublittoral zone, on soft sediments of varying types and among seaweeds. Life cycle S. prolifera is a \\"stolonate\\" worm and has an unusual life cycle. When the worm has reached a length of about forty segments, the posterior portion of the worm develops into a stolon inside which the gonads mature. The stolon is either female (pale orange) or male (whitish) and becomes a storage receptacle for the eggs or sperm. Breeding is regulated by the phases of the moon, and when the breeding period arrives, the stolon becomes detached and joins others to swarm in the water column, in a process known as \\"epitoky\\". Here the gametes are released and the stolon dies. Meanwhile, the parent worm remains on the seabed and starts to grow a new stolon which is ready for release some 28 days later. When fertilised, the eggs sink to the seabed. After about 48 hours they hatch into metatrochophore larvae. After six days, these grow their first segment with parapodia and develop into chaetigerous larvae. Three weeks later they start to grow the pharyngeal apparatus they need as an adult and when this is complete they are juvenile worms. They continue to grow, adding a new segment every two days. They are mature at a length of about forty segments.

Governing the Whitecap Indian Reserve No. 94, historically referred to as the Moose Woods Sioux Reserve, it is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Dundurn No. 314 and located along Highway 219 between the South Saskatchewan River and CFAD Dundurn. Wapahaska (White Cap), a Dakota, was born in 1819 and died in 1889. In the 1850s White Cap had been a Headman of the Five Lodges Band, he was believed to have been a son or perhaps a nephew of Old Thunder Face. His group was an aggressive portion of that band that became designated as the Cankute or Shoot the Woods people. White Cap fled to Canada from Minnesota with Standing Buffalo after the so-called Minnesota Massacre of 1862. While in Canada Standing Buffalo and White Cap engaged a Metis trader by the name of Georges Racette to work for them and represent them in their negotiations with the Canadian government. On March 14, 1870 White Cap wrote a letter to Lt. Governor Adams Archibald of Fort Garry to inform him of his intentions to settle permanently on British territory. He said that he and his nation (presumably including Standing Buffalo's band) lived on English ground and had made peace with the Metis, Chippewa, Cree, and Assiniboine. After fleeing Minnesota in 1862, a number of Dakota Sioux who went to the North West Territory joined Metis buffalo hunting groups. James H. Howard notes: There was also a considerable band of Eastern Sioux under White Cap and the son of Standing Buffalo who ranged further west on the Qu‚ÄôAppelle River in present Saskatchewan. When contacted by the treaty commissioners in 1875, White Cap informed them that his people had been in the region for thirteen years and that they wished to be left as they were, with the privilege of hunting with the Metis. They did not wish to settle on reserves with the other Sioux. Barkwell, Lawrence. http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/11967.White%20Cap.pdf Chief Wapahaska first selected a reserve near the elbow of the South Saskatchewan River at Aiktow, but because of the sandy soil in 1878, he moved north near the Metis settlement of Prairie Ronde, located in the Moose Woods, south of Saskatoon. This made his group neighbours to Charles Trottier's Metis Band. The two groups had hunted buffalo together on the plains for many years and Trottier was considered to be a Chief within the Dakota Sioux community. The two groups had also intermarried over the years and Trottier often referred to them as his cousins. Whitecap was given a reserve at Moose Woods in 1879 but it was not surveyed until 1881. Barkwell, Lawrence. Op cit. As noted Chief Wapahaska (White Cap) and his band eventually settled along the South Saskatchewan River, and received a reserve in June 1881 despite not having signed a treaty. The First Nation has a registered population of 656 people as of March 2017; approximately 322 members of the First Nation live on-reserve and approximately 334 live off-reserve. The First Nation is led by Chief Darcy Bear and is affiliated with the Saskatoon Tribal Council. The Dakota Dunes Casino is located on Whitecap Dakota First Nation.

Identity It is unclear who this John Martin was, although there are several mentions of other John Martins which may relate to him. There were Martins involved in governing Berwick-upon-Tweed later in the sixteenth century, who may have been his relations. The first guild book of the town is incomplete between 1509 and 1537, leaving us little information. Not all Members of Parliament had connections to the area they represented, and it has been speculated that he was the John Martin who was baron of Leconfield, Yorkshire, and served Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland as Groom of the Chamber in October 1523. This Martin was with the Earl in Newcastle upon Tyne in 1523 and was given an annuity from a North Riding of Yorkshire manor by the Earl. It is also speculated that John Cooper, who he served alongside and who we also have scant information on, may have been associated with the Earl and the Percy family. There was also a John Martin who served as a member of Cardinal Wolsey's household in the 1520s. Without being clear on his identity, we have no information on his family, early life or career outside Parliament. Career He was a Member (MP) of the Parliament of England for Berwick-upon- Tweed in 1529. It can be speculated that he may have also been returned in 1536, as Henry VIII had asked for the serving Members of Parliament to be re- elected.

Cast * Bob Mason as Les * Veronica Roberts as Carol, Les' girlfriend * Rachel Davies as Yvonne, Les' sister Plot Before his date with Carol, Les brings her to his family's flat. His sister Yvonne arrives soon after, and the three engage in small talk, wherein Yvonne reveals that her husband left her and she has decided to try dating again. Les eventually rushes Yvonne off, and he and Carol resume their awkward conversation, which nearly ends due to her impatience with him. She asks if he has treated previous girlfriends in such a manner, and he admits to her being his first. He has also never had sex, which explains him never making a pass at Carol. His stepfather's misinformation of sex has caused Les to remain a virgin. Les apologises for his behaviour, as Carol looks around the flat, spying his ukulele. She asks him to play for her, and he sings \\"Leaning on a Lamp-post\\". She kisses him. Yvonne returns, after her date was a no-show. Les invites her to go out with them, but she declines.

History During the early stages of World War II, when it was going well for Germany, the airline Deutsche Lufthansa raised a requirement for a postwar transatlantic flying boat with a capacity of 100 passengers. Blohm & Voss gave the design work to their Head of Preliminary Design, Hans Amtmann, who had the necessary experience.Amtmann, Hans; The Vanishing paperclips, Monogram (1988), pp.67, 72-73.Amtmann, Hans; \\"Blohm & Voss Remembered\\", Part I, Aeroplane Monthly, February 1998, pp.26-27. Design Structurally, the P 200 was a scaled-up BV 222 Wiking. It was bigger even than the BV 238, and only the Hughes H-4 Hercules has ever been bigger.Cowin (1963). Its hull accommodated three deck levels, providing luxury facilities for 120 passengers, with additional freight holds fore and aft. The wing used Chief Designer Richard Vogt's standard technique of a tubular steel wing spar which also functioned as the main fuel tankage. Its section was thick enough for engineers to go along inside the wings and attend to the engines in flight. The P 200 was to be powered by eight BMW 803 series twin-radial engines, each driving a contra- rotating propeller and delivering .

Early life Laura Davis Worley was born in McMinnville, Tennessee in 1849, the daughter of Frank and Betty Davis. She was a descendant of Frederick Davis, one of the original settlers of Nashville and niece of Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy during the American Civil War. She was graduated in 1865 from St. Cecilia's Convent, in Nashville, where she laid the foundation of a liberal education and devoted much time to the study of music, painting and the French language. After leaving school she continued her studies with private teachers. She traveled much in the United States and Canada. Career Finding the need of occupation and amusement in a little country village, Worley turned her attention to dairy farming. She owned a large herd of Holstein and Jersey cattle and made a high grade of butter. She shipped butter to Indianapolis, Louisville, and Chicago. The venture was too large for a small town like Ellettsville and it was liquidated. She was the secretary of the Indiana State Dairy Association since its organization, and was a writer on subjects connected with dairying in all its branches. She was affiliated with the agriculture department at Purdue University. She was a member of the World's Fair Congress Auxiliary in the labor department, vice-president of the Indiana Farmers' Reading Circle, and a member of the advisory board of the National Farmers' Reading Circle. She was a member of the executive committee of the World's Fair Managers for Indiana. Laura‚Äôs sister, Florence Davis, was appointed by the Governor of Tennessee to also serve on the World‚Äôs Fair commission. In 1893 she was one of the commissioner of the World's Columbian Exposition. She is the author of \\"The Kenner Family\\". Personal life She became the wife of Frank E. Worley, a banker and a large land-owner, of Ellettsville, Indiana. He was the owner of the Worley Bank. The bank was caught up in the Panic of 1893 and Worley lost several thousand dollars in personal wealth. The Frank E. Worley House on the outskirts of Ellettsville was built in 1876 on the site of the old home of Worley's parents. The new house had a tower in the center front and the entrance is through the portico formed by the base of the tower. The architect was Joseph Marshall, Indianapolis. The stone mason was Thomas McIntosh of Greencastle. The Worleys sold it in 1898 and moved to St. Louis, Missouri. The house was demolished in 1942. The Worleys owned a Mansion on Mobile Avenue in Daytona, Florida. She died in August 1937, in St. Louis, and is buried at Riverside Cemetery, McMinnville. Legacy In 1915 she paid to place the Davis Memorial Fountain in the city park of McMinnville, as a memorial to her parents. The fountain feature a statue of Hebe, goddess of youth. She was the first benefactor for the founding of the Wm. H. & Edgar J. Magness Community House and Library or Magness Library, in McMinnville.

Career Born in capital city of Croatia, Zagreb, Graf started his football path in football school of local city based lower league Kusto≈°ija football club where he spent his entire youth career. With Kusto≈°ija he also kicked off his senior career in 2006‚Äì07 season which was his first senior competitive season. After debut season with Kusto≈°ija he decided to leave his domestic club on a free transfer and joined another lower league city club, neighbouring Vrapƒçe on a two-year contract for the start of 2007‚Äì08 season. Graf spent two seasons in row with Vrapƒçe and by the end of 2008‚Äì09 season with his two-year contract completed he decided not to extend his contract and stay at Vrapƒçe. He felt as a free player it was time to move on and to change the domain of Croatian lower league football after playing it for three seasons. Therefore, joining Slovenian club Primorje Ajdov≈°ƒçina the following season was seen as uncommon move due to general opinion at the time that Slovenian football was limited compared to Croatian one in almost all aspects of football such as tactics, training, style of play, finance, managing, fan base and overall status of football and was not attractive enough for Croatian football players whose financial demands were higher. However, Graf made a firm decision to join NK Primorje Ajdov≈°ƒçina due to initiative from Primorje head coach Vjekoslav Lokica. Croatian coach Lokica after tight relegation from Slovenian PrvaLiga in 2008‚Äì09 season was preparing the team for express comeback and saw in young Graf a key figure to secure the promotion. NK Primorje was seen till then for a number of seasons as a stable Slovenian first division club and with Graf in defence they achieved the goal, becoming Slovenian Second League Champions with only two games lost and sixteen goals conceded in entire 2009‚Äì10 season winning so promotion to Slovenian PrvaLiga for 2010‚Äì11 season in style. In October 2010, it was announced that the salaries of him along with four other players were due. As a result, he started a legal procedure. He was also linked to a transfer to fellow Slovenian club Dom≈æale. In March 2011, he moved to Ukrainian club Tavriya on a two year contract and became the sixth signing for the club in the winter transfer window. In October, his contract was terminated by mutual consent. Graf returned to Croatia in 2012 and signed for Luƒçko on an undisclosed fee. In 2013, he was transferres to Zagreb. In July, he joined fellow Croatian club Istra 1961. He made his debut in a 3‚Äì1 victory against Osijek where he scored a goal in the 59th minute. Graf joined Kazakhstan Premier League team FC Irtysh Pavlodar at the start of the 2015 season, being told he could leave the club in July 2015, before signing a new one-year deal with Irtysh Pavlodar in January 2016.

Virginia, No. 16-1027, 584 U.S. ___ (2018), was a case before the US Supreme Court involving search and seizure. At issue was whether the Fourth Amendment's motor vehicle exception permits a police officer uninvited and without a warrant to enter private property, approach a house, and search a vehicle parked a few feet from the house that is otherwise visible from off the property. In an 8‚Äì1 judgement, the Supreme Court ruled that the automobile exception does not apply to vehicles parked within the home or the curtilage of a private homeowner.. Background In Albemarle County, Virginia, Officer David Rhodes observed from the street what appeared to be a motorcycle with a distinctive appearance under a tarp parked on the property of a home in which the Charlottesville resident Ryan Austin Collins was staying. Rhodes had recognized the colors from a previous high-speed chase two months earlier in which the rider of the motorcycle had eluded him. Rhodes found photographs of the motorcycle on Collins's Facebook pages that appeared to be taken from where he had seen it parked, which was near the home in an area that was walled on one side by the home and on two sides by a short brick wall. With that as reasonable cause, Rhodes entered the property in the absence of Collins and, without a warrant, lifted the tarp, observed the vehicle identification number, took additional photographs, and determined that the bike had been stolen. When Collins returned to the home, Rhodes arrested him on charges of stealing the bike, and the key to the motorcycle was discovered in Collins's possession on arrest. Collins denied owning or having ridden the bike for months. At trial court, Collins argued that the police had illegally entered the property to search it, as the vehicle was parked with the walled area that he considered the curtilage of the home, a violation under the Fourth Amendment, and sought to void the evidence taken by Rhodes's search. The state argued that the previous chase and both photographs Collins had posted on Facebook of himself and the motorcycle were sufficient cause.Collins v. Commonwealth, 292 Va. 486, 790 S.E.2d 611 (2016). The trial court agreed with the state that Rhodes has reasonable cause to search under the tarp. The ruling was upheld both in the state's appeal courts and in the Virginia Supreme Court, with the latter affirming that Rhodes's search was proper under the motor vehicle exception to the Fourth Amendment defined by past Supreme Court cases, which allowed for warrantless searches for automobiles with reasonable cause. Supreme Court Collins petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari on whether the Fourth Amendment protected his rights of privacy for the area a few feet from the boundaries of his home. The Supreme Court agreed in September 2017 to hear the case. The Court heard oral arguments on January 9, 2018. In oral arguments, the Justices discussed the curtilage, the homeowner's expectation of privacy there, and the officer's right to enter on the property. They discussed the officer's right to lift the tarp, which was potentially a search. Aldo, they discussed the difference between an automobile, which is potentially mobile and creates an exigent circumstance for search, with drugs or papers, which are immobile. The discussion devolved into a discussion of the differences between garage, carport, driveway, and street. Justice Ginsburg pointed out that protection of the garage but not a driveway burdens people who cannot afford a garage. Decision The Court announced judgment in favor of the accused on May 29, 2018, reversing and remanding the case back to lower courts. The Court ruled 8‚Äì1 that the automobile exemption does not include the home or curtilage and that vehicles that are stored within the home's curtilage cannot be searched without a warrant. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion, which was joined by all but Justice Samuel Alito. Justice Clarence Thomas also wrote a concurring opinion agreeing with the decision but questioning if the Court had the right to force states to suppress incriminating evidence that was obtained unconstitutionally, as that would be akin to forcing states to follow the federal exclusionary rule. Alito wrote the sole dissenting opinion, arguing that whether the motorcycle was parked in the curtilage or not was unnecessary since the motorcycle was within plain view and so there was a reasonable cause for the officer to examine the vehicle.

Werker was a blacklisted Hollywood organizer and producer who collaborated with the Spanish film director Luis Bu√±uel and writer Hugo Butler. Early life Son of William Pepper and Sophie Werker, George Pepper was a violin child prodigy making headlines for soloing with adult symphony orchestras.... At age four, along with his older brother Jack, he raised money to construct the Hollywood Bowl by playing the violin, and both boys names were inscribed in the amphitheater's seats. In 1925, at age 12, Pepper received a scholarship to the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia to study with the violinist Carl Flesch. Later he continued his studies with Leopold Auer and Efrem Zimbalist, until his playing career was cut short by a repetitive stress nerve condition in his left hand at age 24. Career Hollywood organizer During the 1940s, Pepper became secretary of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions (HICCASP). According to Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund's book The Inquisition in Hollywood, during Pepper's term as executive secretary, membership skyrocketed, and the HICCASP became \\"the major outpost of progressivism west of the Hudson River\\". Hollywood intellectuals and stars like Gene Kelly, Gregory Peck, Dalton Trumbo, and Orson Welles worked with the organization to improve the rights, conditions, and pay of industry workers across the country. Blacklisting HICCASP was targeted by the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC) during McCarthyism. Thousands of radical and progressive workers, including Pepper and his wife Jeanette, were blacklisted as \\"potential communists,\\" which meant their termination or exclusion from their profession. On April 25, 1951, film director Edward Dmytryk appeared before HUAC as a friendly witness and named Pepper as a communist. Jeannette Pepper was subsequently named by writer Stanley Roberts on May 20, 1952. Film producer In Spring of 1951, George and Jeanette Pepper fled to Mexico to dodge a subpoena from the Tenney Committee, California's subcommittee of HUAC. In Mexico, Pepper created Producciones Olmec and met Spanish filmmaker Luis Bu√±uel. He introduced Bu√±uel to the blacklisted screenwriter Hugo Butler. Then, working under the alias George P. Werker, Pepper produced Butler's scripts for The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (1954), Torero (1956), The Little Giants (1958), and The Young One (La joven, 1960) Collector Pepper also became one of the foremost authorities and collectors of Pre-Columbian artifacts, with his name displayed as donor of many important works in the National Museum of anthropology in Mexico City. In Mexico City, Pepper met Fred Vanderbilt Field and Nieves Orozco who introduced him to artist Miguel Covarrubias.

Siege money or money of necessity was minted in Newark-on-Trent in 1646 during the third and final siege (1645‚Äì1646) ‚Äî the last year of the First English Civil War. To meet need for money, the besieged Royalists set up a mint that manufactured lozenge-shaped coins ‚Äî half-crowns, shillings, ninepences, and sixpences. Royalist noblemen and gentlemen freely gave their flagons and drinking cups, and these were fashioned into the lozenge-shaped coins. On some of them it is possible to see the pattern of the cup and salver from which they were hastily cut. The coins bore on the obverse a Royal crown between C R, and the value in Roman numerals; and on the reverse \`OBS Newark\` (OBS is an abbreviation of obsidium, Latin for siege), and the year 1645 or 1646, in which they were coined. The year 1645 is confusing because all the coins were probably struck in 1646. Those struck with the year 1645 would have been struck before 25 March (the official start of the year Old Style) and those from 25 March with 1646. History lozenge-shaped coins minted at Newark during the 1646 siege The First English Civil War (1642‚Äì1646), commenced when the King Charles I raised his standard at Nottingham on 22 August 1642, south west of Newark. The town was a mainstay of the Royalist (Cavalier) cause: \\"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by the King after his own surrender\\". The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided many nearby towns of the opposing Parliamentarians (Roundheads). At the end of 1644 it was besieged, but relieved in March by Prince Rupert. Parliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 following more raiding, but this was relieved after a month. The final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. King Charles surrendered at Southwell, west of Newark, on 5 May 1646. He ordered Newark to surrender, which accepted under protest by the town's garrison. Coins were issued dated 1645 and 1646. Those struck in 1645 have face values of thirty, twelve, and nine pence; while those struck in 1646 have in addition sixpences. The general design of these coins is the same, the obverse having within a pearled border the letters \`C R\` on each side of a crown, and the value expressed beneath in Roman numerals; whilst upon the reverse was the legend \`OBS NEWARK\`, with the date beneath, in Arabic figures. All the coins issued from Newark are struck upon lozenge- shaped flans, which flans were apparently cut directly from the dishes, trenchers, and other varieties of silver plate, in the town, or obtained from Royalist adherents in the neighbouring country districts. Also silver from plundered from Leicester including the corporation's plate. By detailed analyse of the coins it is possible to estimate their probable chronological sequence. The first piece to appear would be the shilling, which bears upon the obverse a most curiously shaped crown, the jewelled band of which is straight across the front, whilst the reverse reads \`OBS: NEWARKE 1645\`. This coin is found with the obverse struck from two separate dies: # 9 dots in the left arch of the crown, 9 dots in the right arch ; \`C R\` and \`XII\`. being in thin letters (a). Weight, 94 grains. # 9 dots in the left arch, 8 dots in the right arch; \`C R\` and \`XII\`. being in thick letters. Weight, 93 grains (b). The occurrence of two distinct obverse dies for this coin, in the opinion of Dr. Philip Nelson of Liverpool University (writing in 1904), disproved the theory that has been advanced that these pieces were forgeries; more especially since there are also shillings and ninepences, the obverses of which are known to be genuine, combined with the self same reverse. The second coin to appear was probably the shilling with the same reverse reading, \`NEWARKE\`, but with a new obverse, the crown on which has a high arch and richly jewelled band. It weighs 87 grains. At about the same time ninepences reading, \`NEWARKE\`, were struck, that with pieces from two different obverse dies: # 11 dots in the left arch, 11 dots in the right arch of the crown, which has a richly jewelled band. Weight, 69 grains (c). # 11 dots in the left arch, 9 dots in the right arch of the crown, which has a simple jewelled band. Weight, 68 grains (d). Following this a shilling was issued with wording the following wording appearing for the first time \`OBS NEWARK 1645\`. The crown upon the obverse has 10 dots in the left arch, and 8 dots in the right arch of the crown, the jewelled band of which is of a very simple character. This piece weighs 92 grains. Upon one of the shillings of this date a retrograde R is engraved upon the obverse. Subsequently, the ninepence which reads \`OBS : NEWARK 1645\` appeared (e). The obverse die of this coin is identical with that of the ninepence previously described as \\"d\\", and has upon the crown 11 and 9 dots in the left and right arches respectively. This coin weight 64 grains. United with the same obverse die there was another reverse die in use, the same as found upon the half-crown of 1645, which is verified by the occurrence of a small dot beneath the 4 of the date, 1645. This ninepence weighs 63 grains (f). The last denomination to be struck in 1645 was the half-crown, the obverse of which shows us a crown with a chequered arrangement of jewels on the band; whilst the reverse is from the same die as the NEWARK ninepence \\"f\\" of the same date. This coin, which weight 221 grains, is of comparative rarity, which would point to the fact of its having been struck very late in 1645, probably in March. In regard to the coins struck at Newark in 1646, it is evident that the three higher values would be issued simultaneously, and no doubt towards the end of the siege, probably in April, the sixpence would appear, which no doubt accounts for its greater rarity. In considering the date of these coins it is necessary to remember that the year began on March 25 (and the end of the siege on 8 May). The issues of 1646 are as follow: *Half-crown. ‚Äî obverse: From the same die as the half-crown of 1645. Reverse: From the same die as the shilling \\"b\\" and ninepences of 1646, as is proved by the occurrence a flaw in the 6 of the date. Weight, 243 grains. *Shillings: *# Obverse: A crown with a simply jewelled band, having 10 dots in the left arch and 8 dots in the right arch. Reverse: \`OBS : NEWARK 1646\` in somewhat thin letters. Weight, 86 grains. *# Overse: A crown with a richly jewelled band, having 10 dots in the left arch and 10 dots in the right arch. Reverse: \`OBS . NEWARK 1646\` in thick letters, from the same die as the half-crown. Weight, 90 grains. *Ninepence: *# Overse: From the same die as the ninepence \\"e\\" of 1645, having 11 dots in the left and 9 dots in the right arches respectively. Reverse: From the same die as the shilling (b) and half-crown of 1646. Weight, 67 grains. *# Obverse : A crown having the band elaborately jewelled, 10 dots in the left arch and lo dots in the right arch. Reverse: From the same die as the shilling \\"b\\" and half-crown of 1646. Weight, 68 grains. *Sixpence: obverse: An elaborate crown, \`C R\` on each side and \`VI.\` beneath. Reverse: \`OBS : NEWARK 1646\`. Weight, 46 grains. A lot of examples of the shilling, ninepence, and sixpence of 1646 are found to be gilt, and were doubtless struck upon flans cut from a service of gilt-plate. Some specimens of the shilling and ninepence of 1646 exist having the Royal arms upon the reverse, and the coins so marked may have formed part of some Regal service of plate, which was sacrificed in order to pay the expenses of the siege. Of the coins struck at Newark, two coins stand out. The first is a ninepence, in the collection of coins the property of the Corporation of Liverpool (in 1904), and is of importance since upon the reverse we find beneath the \`A of NEWARK\` a leopard's head, the hall-mark of the period. The second is a shilling which in 1904 was in the possession of Dr. Appleby, of Newark. That coin bears upon the reverse a capital M within a dotted indent, which appears to be a silversmith's private stamp, and indicates the source from whence the piece of plate originally came. There was in the Hyman Montagu (1844‚Äì1895) collection a specimen of a shilling bearing only an impression of the obverse die, and the reverse being plain; the coin is, therefore, undated. Legacy Surviving coins are collectors' items and can be valuable; in 2012 a Newark shilling sold for US$1,900. Apart from their obvious interest to numismatists and historians, images of the coins are used to decorate rubbish bins, and a few residents of Newark would like to introduce a \\"Newark Siege Pound\\" as a form of local currency they believe would benefit the local economy.

He served as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the world's largest paper bag manufacturing company, Duro Bag Manufacturing from 1987 to 2014 before selling it to South Carolina-based Hilex Poly Co. LLC. Early life Shor was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on April 2, 1954. His father, S. David Shor had started the Covington, Kentucky-based paper bag manufacturing business, Duro Bag Manufacturing the year before Charles was born. At this point, the company had one location with only a handful of employees. In 1976, Charles graduated from University of Michigan with a degree in economics. In 1977, Charles joined the family business where he worked alongside his father until the elder Shor's death in 1987, at which point Charles took over responsibilities as Duro Bag's chief executive officer. Epilepsy Early in life, Shor had only experienced intermittent seizures. However, after a kidnapping attempt and being promoted to president of Duro, Shor began to have seizures on an almost-daily basis. Shortly after, he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Charles' epilepsy eventually inspired him to start the Charles L. Shor Foundation for Epilepsy Research. Career After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1976, Charles joined his family business as a salesman in 1977. After four years with the company, Charles' father named him president of Duro Bag at the age of 27. After his father's death in 1987, 33-year old Shor took the helm at Duro Bag where he was instantly faced with various challenges. In addition to his epilepsy, as well as increased competition from the plastic industry, Duro Bag's lender had also threatened to call the company's loans. However, then-local Fifth Third Bank eventually agreed to take on Duro's debt. Fifth Third Banks's assistance gave Duro Bag the time it needed in order to realign its business strategy, ultimately resulting in Duro Bag's becoming the largest paper bag manufacturing company in the world. During Shor's tenure as chief executive officer and majority owner, Duro Bag made several innovations in the realm of paper bags, including; the first grocery bag made from 100% recycled material, the first tear-proof shopping bag (made from DuPont's TyVek material), as well as the first specialty bags for retailers; Tiffany's and Hallmark. Duro Bag purchased 17 competing paper bag companies on its path to becoming the biggest paper bag company in the world. As a result of Duro's innovations in paper bags, the company found itself on the list of The Cincinnati Enquirer's top 100 private companies. Starting in 1988, Duro Bag moved from 7th to 5th to 4th, where it remained a consistent top 10 until 2014. In 2014, Charles Shor sold Duro Bag to Hilex Poly Co. LLC. for an undisclosed amount. The South Carolina-based paper bag firm bought Duro in an effort to augment its line of recycled products. On July 3, 2014 the formal relationship between Shor was effectively dissolved as the sale was finalized. Philanthropy Prior to a kidnapping attempt at age 25, Shor had only ever experienced a handful of seizures. However, due to the harrowing event, his seizures became an almost daily occurrence. After being diagnosed with epilepsy, Shor continued in his career as chief executive officer of Duro Bag, and joined the medical community in its fight against the disorder. In 2002, Shor launched the Charles L Shor Foundation for Epilepsy Research. The foundation has made donations in excess of $1,000,000 to various organizations including University of Cincinnati, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and the Children's Hospital of Cincinnati and is one of the top private foundations in Ohio. Through the foundation, Charles Shor has also heavily contributed to several neurological studies aimed to better understand seizures and the effect of stress on the brain. Though it is a major focus, Charles Shor's philanthropy is not solely reserved for epilepsy. In addition to his support for epilepsy research, Charles Shor, and the Charles L. Shor Foundation (not to be confused with the Charles L. Shor Foundation for Epilepsy Research) have consistently made contributions to Northern Kentucky University, the Cincinnati Zoo, and more. In 2017, Charles Shor was the founding donor of the \\"Charlie Shor Park\\" at Aleh Negev, a rehabilitation village for disabled children and adults located in southern Israel.

The movie was shot in the city of Berlin and after its web release on August 2, 2013, it became a small case among the Bitcoin community and between augmented reality video game developers. The documentary had its European Premiere at Cineglobe Film Festival du CERN, now Geneva International Film Festival Tous Ecrans, where it won the Audience Favourite Documentary prize and its North American premiere at the Silicon Valley Science Fiction Short Film Festival. The movie was also named and shown as a nominee in many other film festivals. Overview The short movie describes the possible aftermaths due to the release of an augmented reality game, which awards its users with Bitcoin prizes. The game is an action game inspired to the Nintendo‚Äôs Super Mario Bros platform game, transposed to an augmented reality environment. The actors walk through the city, jumping, climbing, grasping yellow coins with their phones, obsessed by the gold fever. The Berlin city is the stage of this strange behaviour, while the gamers discover new ways of living the city landscape and its socio- economic texture. The game has been seen as an allegorization of the gold farming and microlabor mechanisms of Bitcoin mining. Part of the work is dedicated to the \\"Bitcoin kiez\\", a district of Berlin Kreuzberg which aroused the interest of the media for being the place with the highest density of businesses accepting the Bitcoin currency in the world. The story is a consideration of the huge impact that the usage of smartphones on a great scale and the rising business of the big data market and data mining can have on the private life and habits of the users, as local Bitcoin developers, journalists and hackers discuss about the secret identity of the game developer, which winks at the mysterious figure of the Bitcoin designer Satoshi Nakamoto, and about the financial reasons which lay behind the release of the game app. Release During the weeks after its release, The 1 Up Fever received critical praise, and many started searching for how to download the game app, until the author revealed the Mockery. In 2017 The 1 Up Fever was on the news again, to have been allegedly inspired the Pokemon Challenge's April 1st Mockery of 2014, and the consequent creation of the Pok√©mon GO App. References External links * 2013 short films 2013 independent films Films shot in Berlin Student films Films about video games 2013 films German independent films ","title":"The 1 Up Fever"},{"id":"55376872","text":"Cossar is a surname.

In other words, the appreciation for the benefits arising from the success of an endeavor is heightened, but the appreciation of the risks of failure lags behind. The dual systems model hypothesizes that early maturation of the socioemotional system (including brain regions like the striatum) increases adolescents' attraction for exciting, pleasurable, and novel activities during a time when cognitive control systems (including brain regions like the prefrontal cortex) are not fully developed and thus cannot regulate these appetitive, and potentially hazardous, impulses. The temporal gap in the development of the socioemotional and cognitive control systems creates a period of heightened vulnerability to risk-taking during mid-adolescence. In the dual systems model, \\"reward sensitivity\\" and \\"cognitive control\\" refer to neurobiological constructs that are measured in studies of brain structure and function. Other models similar to the dual systems model are the maturational imbalance model, the driven dual systems model, and the triadic model.  Historical perspective  The dual systems model arose out of evidence from developmental cognitive neuroscience providing insight into how patterns of brain development could explain aspects of adolescent decision-making. In 2008, Laurence Steinberg's laboratory at Temple University and BJ Casey's laboratory at Cornell separately proposed similar dual systems theories of adolescent risky decision-making. Casey et al. termed their model the maturational imbalance model.  Models  Development of the socioemotional and cognitive control systems as depicted by the dual systems model, maturational imbalance model, and driven dual systems model  Maturational imbalance model  Both the dual systems model and the maturational imbalance model conceive of a slower developing cognitive control system that matures through late adolescence. The dual systems model proposes an inverted-U shape development of the socioemotional system, such that reward responsivity increases in early adolescence and declines thereafter. The maturational imbalance model portrays a socioemotional system that reaches its peak around mid-adolescence and then plateaus into adulthood. Further, the dual systems model proposes that the development of the cognitive control and socioemotional systems is independent whereas the maturational imbalance proposes that the maturation of the cognitive control system leads to dampening of socioemotional responsivity.  Driven dual systems model  Recently, another variation of the dual systems model was proposed called the \\"driven dual systems model\\". This model proposes an inverted-U shaped trajectory of socioemotional system responsivity, similar to the dual systems model, but hypothesizes a cognitive control trajectory that plateaus in mid-adolescence. This cognitive control trajectory differs from that proposed by the dual systems model and maturational imbalance model which continues to increase into the early 20s. Similar to the driven dual systems model, a model has been proposed including a hyperactive socioemotional system that undermines the regulatory ability of the cognitive control system. These later models hypothesize that cognitive control development is completed by mid-adolescence and attribute increased risk-taking during adolescence to the hyperarousal of the socioemotional system. The dual systems model and maturational imbalance model propose that cognitive control development continues into early adulthood and that increased risk-taking in adolescence is attributable to a developmental imbalance where the socioemotional system is at its peak of development but the cognitive control system developmental trajectory lags behind.  Triadic model  The \\"triadic model\\", which includes a third brain system responsible for emotion processing and primarily implicating the amygdala. The triadic model proposes that this emotion system increases impulsivity during adolescence by increasing the perceived cost of delaying decision-making. This model posits that impulsivity and risk seeking in adolescence is due to a combination of hyperactive reward systems causing adolescents to approach appetitive stimuli, emotion processing systems causing adolescents to enhance perceived costs of delaying behaviors and reduce avoidance of potentially negative stimuli, and an underdeveloped cognitive control system that is unable to regulate reward-seeking behaviors.  Adolescent risk-taking  Risk-taking in certain, but not all, domains peaks during adolescence. Most notably, mortality and morbidity rates increase significantly from childhood to adolescence despite the fact that physical and mental capabilities increase during this period. The primary cause for this increase in mortality/morbidity among adolescents is preventable injury. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2014 about 40% of all adolescent deaths (ages 15‚Äì19 years) were caused by unintentional accidents. From 1999 to 2006, almost one-half of all adolescent deaths (ages 12‚Äì19 years) were due to accidental injury. Of these unintentional injuries, about 2/3 are due to motor vehicle accidents, followed by unintentional poisoning, unintentional drowning, other land transportation accidents, and unintentional discharge of firearms. The dual systems model proposes that mid-adolescence is the time of highest biological propensity for risk-taking, but that older adolescents may exhibit higher levels of real- world risk-taking (e.g., binge drinking is most common during the early 20s) not due to greater propensity for risk-taking but due to greater opportunity. For example, individuals in their early 20s compared to mid-adolescence have less adult supervision, greater financial resources, and greater legal privileges. The dual systems model looks to experimental paradigms in developmental neuroscience for evidence of this greater biological propensity for risk-taking. There is also a consistent relation between age and crime with adolescents and young adults being more likely to engage in violent and non-violent crime. These findings are linked to increases in sensation- seeking, which is the tendency to seek out novel, exciting, and rewarding stimuli, during adolescence, and continued development of impulse control, which is the ability to regulate one's behavior. The dual systems model points to brain development as a mechanism for this association.  Reward seeking  Across many species including humans, rodents, and nonhuman primates, adolescents demonstrate peaks in reward-seeking behaviors. For example, adolescent rats are more sensitive than adult rats to rewarding stimuli and show enhanced behavioral responses to novelty and peers. Adolescent humans show peaks in self-reported sensation-seeking, increased neural activation to monetary and social rewards, greater temporal discounting of delayed rewards, and heightened preferences for primary rewards (e.g., sweet substances). Sensation-seeking is a type of reward seeking involving the tendency to seek out novel, exciting, and rewarding stimuli. Sensation-seeking has been found to increase in preadolescence, peak in mid-adolescence, and decline in early adulthood.  Impulsivity  Impulsivity has been found to exhibit a different developmental trajectory than reward or sensation seeking. Impulsivity gradually declines with age in a linear fashion. Around mid- adolescence when impulsivity and sensation-seeking are at their peak is the theoretical peak age for risk-taking according to the dual systems model.  Social influence  Adolescent risk-taking is more likely to occur in the presence of peers compared to adults. Animal studies have found that adolescent mice, but not adult mice, consume more alcohol in the presence of peers than when alone. In humans, the presence of peers has been found to result in increased activation in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex risk- taking, and activation in these regions predicted subsequent risk-taking among adolescents but not adults. Age differences in activation of the striatum and frontal cortex have been interpreted to suggest heightened risk-taking in the presence of peers is due to the influence of peers on reward processing rather than the influence of peers on cognitive control.  Socioemotional system  The term socioemotional brain network or system (also known as the ventral affective system) refers to the striatum as well as the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices.  Dopamine  Evidence from rodent studies indicates the dopaminergic system, the pathway connecting the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, plays a critical role in the brain's reward circuitry and the dopamine-rich striatum has been implicated as a key contributor to reward sensitivity in the brain. During puberty, the dopaminergic system undergoes significant reorganization. Increased dopamine projections from mesolimbic areas (e.g., the striatum) to the prefrontal cortex have been observed during mid- and late-adolescence. These projections are pruned/decline in early adulthood. Adolescent-specific peaks in dopamine receptors in the striatum have been observed in humans and rodents. Additionally, dopamine concentrations projecting to the prefrontal cortex increase into adolescence as do the dopamine projections from the prefrontal cortex to the striatum (namely the nucleus accumbens).  Hyper- versus hypo- sensitivity to reward  The striatum has been linked to reward processing, learning, and motivation. = Hyperactivity = Neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the ventral striatum is more active among adolescents compared to children and adults when receiving monetary rewards, primary rewards, and social rewards. Peaks in striatal activity as associated with increased self-reported risk-taking. = Hypoactivity = Some studies have found that striatum activity is blunted compared to children and adults when anticipating rewards, which has been linked to greater risk-taking behaviors. The theory linking this hypoactivation to greater risk-taking is that adolescents experience less gratifying experience from anticipating rewards and they are therefore motivated to seek out more reward-inducing experiences to achieve the same level of reward sensation as other age groups. = Current consensus = Although evidence exists for both adolescent hyper-responsiveness to rewards and hypo-responsiveness to rewards, the field of developmental neuroscience has generally converged on the view of hyper-responsiveness. In other words, that is, that adolescents are motivated, in part, to engage in greater reward- seeking behaviors because of developmental changes in the striatum that contribute to hypersensitivity to reward.  Cognitive control system  The cognitive control system refers to the lateral prefrontal, lateral parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices. The most commonly investigated region is the prefrontal cortex which undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence. The development of the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the ability to regulate behavior and engage in inhibitory control. As a result of synaptic pruning and myelination of the prefrontal cortex, improvements in executive functions have been observed during adolescence.  Synaptic pruning  During development, the brain undergoes overproduction of neurons and their synaptic connections and then prunes those that are unnecessary for optimal functioning. This developmental process results in grey matter reduction over development. During adolescence, this pruning process is specialized with some areas losing approximately half of their synaptic connections but others showing little change. Total grey matter volume undergoes substantial pruning starting around puberty. The process of grey matter loss (i.e., maturation) occurs differentially in different brain regions with frontal and occipital poles losing grey matter early, but the prefrontal cortex losing grey matter only at the end of adolescence.  Myelination  In addition to synaptic pruning, the brain undergoes myelination, which influences the speed of information flow across brain regions. Myelination involves neuronal axons connecting certain brain areas to become insulated with a white, fatty substance called myelin that increases the speed and efficiency of transmission along axons. Myelination increases dramatically during adolescence. Myelination contributes to the developmental thinning or reduction in grey matter in the prefrontal cortex during adolescence.  Links to inhibitory control  Evidence supporting the dual systems model theory of delayed maturation of the cognitive control system is supported by evidence of structural changes like cortical thinning as well as less diffuse activation of frontal regions during inhibitory control tasks from adolescence to adulthood. Regardless of age, increased activation of the prefrontal cortex is related to better performance on response inhibition tasks.  Experimental paradigms   Reward tasks  Three primary experimental paradigms are used to study reward behavior in adolescents (1) passive receipt of reward, (2) reward conditional on task performance, and (3) decision-making selecting different types of reward options. = Passive exposure tasks = Passive exposure tasks generally involve exposing the participant to pleasant stimuli (e.g., monetary reward, attractive faces). These paradigms also involve exposure to negative stimuli for the purposes of comparison (e.g., monetary loss, angry faces). Although these tasks are more commonly used to investigate emotion processing rather than reward, some studies have used a slot-machine passive task to target reward circuitry in the brain. Faces have also been used as reward for motivational paradigms. Passive exposure tasks have been found to activate the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex, with striatal activation greater in adolescents in response to rewarding stimuli but orbitofrontal activation greater in adults in response to negative stimuli. = Performance contingent tasks = Reward tied to task performance typically involves participants being asked to complete a task in order to obtain a reward (and sometimes to avoid losing a reward). Task performance is not necessarily directly related to the reward. Examples of this type of task are the Pirate's paradigm, monetary incentive delay (MID) task, Iowa Gambling Task, Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and Columbia Card Task, among others. Differences in activation to anticipation of reward versus preparation to try and achieve reward have been reported on performance related reward tasks. = Decision-making tasks = Reward decision-making tasks involve participants being asked to choose among different options of reward. Sometimes the rewards differ on probability, magnitude, or type of reward (e.g., social versus monetary). These tasks are typically conceived to not have a correct or incorrect response, but rather to have decision-making based on the participants' preference. Examples of decision making tasks include delay discounting tasks and the Driving Game. During feedback on decision-making tasks, greater striatal activation to rewarding outcomes has been observed in adolescents compared to adults.  Response inhibition tasks  Common response inhibition tasks are the Go/No- Go, Flanker, Stroop, Stop Signal, and anti-saccade tasks. Individuals who perform well on these tasks generally activate the prefrontal cortex to a greater extent than individuals who perform poorly on these tasks. Performance on these tasks improves with age. = Go/No-Go task = The Go/No-Go task requires participants to respond, usually by pressing a button or a key on a computer keyboard, to a designated cue or withhold a response, by not pressing the button/key, to a different designated cue. Variants of this task include alphabet letters, shapes, and faces. = Flanker task = The Flanker task typically involves presentation of a target flanked by non-target stimuli that is either in the same direction as the target (congruent) or in the opposite direction of a target (incongruent) or neither direction (neutral). Participants have to respond to the direction of the target ignoring the non- target stimuli. = Stroop tasks = Stroop tasks require participants to respond to one facet of the presented stimuli (e.g., read the word) but ignore another competing facet (e.g., ignore a contradictory color). = Stop signal task = The Stop Signal task is similar to the Go/No-Go task in that participants see a cue indicating a go trial. For stop trials, participants see the go cue but then are presented with the stop signal (typically a sound) indicating they should not respond to the go trial. Presenting the stop signal after the go cue makes this task more difficult than traditional Go/No-Go tasks. = Anti-saccade task = Anti-saccade tasks typically require participants to fixate on a motionless target. A stimulus is then presented on one side of the target and the participant is asked to make a saccade (either move their eyes or respond with a button press) in the direction away from the stimulus.  Legal relevance  Adolescent developmental immaturity and culpability were central to three US Supreme Court cases: Roper v. Simmons,Roper v. Simmons 543 U.S. 551 (2005) Graham v. Florida,Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48 (2010) and Miller v. Alabama.Miller v. Alabama, 567 U.S. 460 (2012) Prior to Roper in 2005, the Supreme Court had relied on common sense standards to determine adolescent culpability. For example, in Thompson v. Oklahoma,Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815 (1988) the Court prohibited capital punishment for individuals under the age of 16 stating that \\"Contemporary standards of decency confirm our judgment that such a young person is not capable of acting with the degree of culpability that can justify the ultimate penalty.\\" In Roper, however, the Court looked to developmental science as rationale for abolishing capital punishment for juveniles. In 2010, the Court ruled life without parole was unconstitutional for juveniles in Graham and in 2012 the Court ruled that States could not mandate life without parole for juveniles even in the case of homicide in Miller. In Miller, the Court stated \\"It is increasingly clear that adolescent brains are not yet fully mature in regions and systems related to higher-order executive functions such as impulse control, planning ahead, and risk avoidance.\\"  Criticism  Others have criticized the triadic model for a lack of evidence implicating the emotion processing systems (e.g., the amygdala) in risk-taking during adolescence.

It is a common feature in apples and pears. Russeting is typically an undesirable trait, which reduces the storage life of fruits and makes their appearance unattractive to consumers, although some cultivars, so-called russet apples, are appreciated for the feature. Causes In apples and pears, russet results from micro-cracking of the cuticle, the outer epidermal layer of the fruit. The cuticle is a natural waterproof barrier composed of a polymerized cutin matrix embedded with waxes, which protects the fruit from outside stresses, and helps maintain post- harvest preservation. When the cuticle cracks, a corky suberized layer is formed on the fruit skin. Apples are particularly susceptible to russet. Many naturally-occurring varieties exhibit the feature consistently, while other cultivars may develop russet due to environmental stresses. As a result, cuticular structure is impaired, leading to reduced strength of the peel, which impacts handling and post-harvest processing. Russeting and cuticular cracks may accelerate the development of flesh browning due to oxidation, as well as softening of internal tissue due to the loss of an external support.

He graduated from the Moscow Art School and in 1946, right after the end of war, joined animation courses at Soyuzmultfilm where he watched many \\"trophy\\" movies, including films by Disney that served as a major inspiration for him. Between 1947 and 1949 Stepantsev worked as animator on a number of films, including the award-winning Grey Neck (1948) by Leonid Amalrik and Vladimir Polkovnikov.Grey Neck at Animator.ru He spent the next five years serving in the Soviet Navy, and on his return entered the Moscow State University of Printing Arts while continuing his animation career. In 1954 he co-directed his first short A Villain with a Label (together with Vsevolod Shcherbakov) which also became one of the first Soviet post-war stop motion animated films produced at the newly founded puppet division of Soyuzmultfilm. Vovka in a Far Far Away Kingdom stamp based on the animated film Starting with 1955 Stepanstev worked with Anatoly Savchenko, an art director and his regular collaborator on the majority of his animated and art projects that included book illustrations and filmstrips produced for the Diafilm studio.Books and diafilms by Boris Stepantsev at the National Children's Digital Library (in Russian) In 1958 they produced Petya and the Little Red Riding Hood, a postmodern comedy based on the fairy tale by Vladimir Suteev about a pioneer Petya who sneaked into the Little Red Riding Hood movie in order to save the girl from the Big Bad Wolf. The film was co-directed by Evgeny Raykovsky and drew inspiration from Disney and Tex Avery in contrast to the majority of \\"realistic\\" movies of that time that used rotoscopy. It turned very popular and won a prize at the 1960 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. In 1962 they made a sequel of sorts ‚Äî a half-hour live-action animated film Not Just Now where Petya, played by a real-life child actor, traveled through time and interacted with hand-drawn environment.Monsters of Animation. Boris Stepantsev at the official 2√ó2 channel (in Russian) From 1956 to 1960 Stepantsev and Raykovsky also directed one of the first Soviet mini-series that starred Murzilka, a popular character from the children's magazine of the same name. The third part, Murzilka on Sputnik (1960), became the first Soviet widescreen animated short and was awarded the first prize at the 1960 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. Since 1963 Stepantsev directed films on his own. Between 1965 and 1970 he produced three of his most popular pictures: Vovka in a Far Far Away Kingdom (1965), another postmodern comedy about a lazy pioneer Vovka who found his way into a book of Russian fairy tales, and the Karlsson-on-the-Roof dilogy (1968, 1970) based on the fairy tale by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. The latter were also the first Soviet animated movies to introduce xerography. With the colorful cartoon art style, funny dialogues and some of the best voice talents involved (Rina Zelyonaya, Vasily Livanov, Klara Rumyanova, Faina Ranevskaya) all of them became extremely quatable and the main characters joined the pantheon of beloved animated icons, along with Cheburashka. In fact, Stepantsev and Savchenko illustrated Cheburashka's adventures for the Diafilm strips in 1968, before the work on animated series was even started.Denis Filin. And the ears are sticking out anyway article at Nezavisimaya Gazeta, December 15, 2005 (in Russian) Author Eduard Uspensky later used it as an argument during his legal battle against the artist Leonid Shvartsman, stating that he held no rights for the character's image.Eduard Uspensky // Cheburashka. The Road to Calvary interview with Eduard Uspensky at the Delo newspaper, October 10, 2005 (in Russian) Junior and Karlson stamp based on the animated dilogy Around the same time Stepantsev felt he \\"got tired from quizzery\\" and decided to explore other themes. He directed two pictures without a single spoken word, based solely on classical music: Window (1968) inspired by Sergei Prokofiev's Visions fugitives and The Nutcracker (1973) adapted from Pyotr Tchaikovsky's ballet of the same name. He described Prokofiev's music as \\"drawing what should happen on screen by itself, defining character's smallest gestures... its dramaturgy was more logical, clearer than many far-fetched plot twists\\". While filming The Nutcracker he and cinematographer Yan Topper used trick photography, and Anatoly Savchenko described the work on it as \\"non-stop torture\\".Curiosity Is My Teacher interview with Anatoly Savchenko at Animator.ru They received awards for both of the movies at the international film festivals in Romania and Spain. In 1967 they produced the first Soviet widescreen paint-on-glass animation Song of a Falcon (1967) based on the story by Maxim Gorky. It also used classical musical score by Alexander Scriabin to tell the story, but with the involvement of several voice actors. In 1972 he was chosen as a vice- president of ASIFA where he served until 1982. In 1974 Iosif Boyarsky \\"lured\\" Stepantsev to the puppet division of Soyuzmultfilm where he directed two stop motion shorts based on Nikolai Gogol's Dead Souls. According to Boyarsky, the second film turned less successful because of the weak voice cast, and Stepantsev left the studio for the Studio Ekran where he served as a creative director of the Multtelefilm animation department from 1980 till his death.Iosif Boyarsky (1995). Literary Collages. ‚Äî Moscow: Russian Binding (online magazine, in Russian) Stepantsev liked to spend a lot of time developing his films, and yet he easily switched between completely different projects as soon as he got obsessed with a new idea. Neither the Karlsson-on- the-Roof nor the Dead Souls series where ever finished because of this. In one of his last publications he expressed a lot of enthusiasm regarding the possibilities of computer animation which he predicted to be the future of animation. His last project Assol (1982) based on the Scarlet Sails novel by Alexander Grin was also his first feature. Once again he decided to combine live action with traditional animation. Only this time he wanted to \\"approach from the other end... to transform a live actor into an animated figure using the achievements of modern photography\\". All this resulted in an unusual look, \\"as if it went through the Prisma app\\". According to Iosif Boyarsky, the work on this movie was hard and nervous, and it undermined director's health.

In the Chicago Review of Books, Dean Jobb called Fraud ‚Äúan ambitious exploration of two centuries‚Äô worth of swindles, bogus stock schemes and corporate crime‚Äù with ‚Äúplenty of shady characters and ingenious fraudulent schemes‚Äù to engage readers. Balleisen is coeditor of Policy Shock: Recalibrating Risk and Regulation after Oil Spills, Nuclear Accidents, and Financial Crises, published in 2017, which explores the ways in which industrialized democracies have reshaped their regulatory institutions following major crises. He also coedited Government and Markets: Toward a New Theory of Regulation, published in 2010, with David Moss, in conjunction with The Tobin Project. This volume includes essays from leading social scientists about the role of effective regulatory policy in constituting markets and reducing socioeconomic harms associated with modern capitalism. Balleisen directed the Rethinking Regulation program at Duke's Kenan Institute for Ethics from 2010 to 2015. While director, he produced Business Regulation, a three-volume work composed of influential writings on regulatory policy since 1870. As Duke‚Äôs vice provost for interdisciplinary studies, Balleisen oversees the Bass Connections program, as well as university-wide institutes and initiatives that foster collaborative research, teaching, and outreach. He is the lead Principal Investigator on the Versatile Humanists at Duke project, funded by a Next Generation PhD implementation grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities. According to Colleen Flaherty of Inside Higher Ed, Balleisen has observed that collaborative research ‚Äúleads to excellence, whether one envisages research within the academy or research outside of it, whether it‚Äôs teaching or whether it‚Äôs civic engagement, again, from the academic perch or outside of it.\\" Works  *Balleisen, Edward J.; Bennear, Lori S.; Krawiec, Kimberly D.; Wiener, Jonathan B.; eds.

Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia XZ1 Compact at the annual IFA 2017 on August 31, 2017. It is the direct successor to the Sony Xperia XZ according to Sony, and is the latest flagship after the Xperia XZ Premium. The Xperia XZ1, along with the Xperia XZ1 Compact, were recognized as the first Android smartphones to come with the recently launched Android 8.0 Oreo operating system pre-installed. Its highlight features are the HDR-enabled 5.2\\" FHD IPS display and a new world's-first-in-a-smartphone 3D-modelling feature that doesn't need a dual camera setup. Hardware Design and Build Sony refreshes the trademark Xperia Loop Surface design for the Xperia XZ1. But instead of using glass surfaces like the Xperia XZ Premium, the XZ1 is mostly consisted of a wraparound metal chassis, making up the back and sides of the device, with subtly-curved nylon top and bottom edges giving a more smoother approach to the overall design. The most defining change in the XZ1 as well as the XZ Premium is the placement of the image sensors at the back. It is now arranged across the camera lens, centered along the top, as opposed to being longitudinally placed below the lens like on the XZs. But unlike the XZ Premium which has a glass back panel, on the XZ1, the NFC antenna is housed alongside the image sensors, placed directly at the center of the glass window. A durable scratch-resistant glass panel made of Corning's Gorilla Glass 5 adorns the front of the device. Dual front-firing stereo speakers with Sony's new S-Force Front Surround stereo, producing 50% more sound pressure than previous Xperia models for a more immersive surround sound, along with a 13 MP front camera, ambient light and proximity sensor and a notification LED make up the Xperia XZ1's front panel. The Xperia XZ1's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . It has an IP rating of IP65/68, making it dust-proof and water resistant for over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes. The device also features a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button that can be used to unlock the phone and secure it from unauthorized access. This feature, however, is disabled on units sold in the US. Display and Performance The Xperia XZ1 is one of the first smartphones with an HDR display. But unlike the Xperia XZ Premium, the Xperia XZ1 abandons the 4K UHD resolution, settling for a 1080p FHD display instead. It is HDR10 compliant just like the XZ Premium, but has no Dolby Vision support. The IPS LCD screen has a pixel density of 424 ppi and features Sony's TRILUMINOS display and X-Reality for mobile technology. It is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (MSM8998) found in the Xperia XZ Premium, built on 10 nm process technology with 8 custom Kryo processors (4x 2.35 GHz and 4x 1.9 GHz), 4 GB of LPDDR4X RAM and uses the Adreno 540 for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 64 GB and comes in single-SIM and dual-SIM versions, with both featuring LTE Cat. 16 with Gigabit-class speeds, a 4x4 MIMO antenna design and a total of 10 antennas. It also has microSD card expansion of up to 256 GB (in a hybrid slot for the dual-SIM variant). Camera Sony debuted in the Xperia XZs and the XZ Premium the world's first three-layer stacked image sensor with DRAM for smartphones. Known as the Sony IMX400, the sensor features a RAM chip sandwiched in between the sensor and control circuitry layers which serves as a large and fast buffer to where the sensor can temporarily offload a significant amount of captured data before transferring it to the phone's internal memory for processing. This enables the camera to record super slow-motion videos at 960 fps, at a steady 720p resolution. Recording at super slow motion is limited to 0.18 seconds per buffer though, due to limitations. The Xperia XZ1 borrows the Motion Eye Camera from the Xperia XZ Premium and XZs. It comprises a 19 MP 1/2.3‚Äù Exmor RS for mobile sensor with a 1.22 Œºm pixel pitch, f/2.0 aperture and 25 mm wide G Lens. It also features 4K video recording, which supports SteadyShot video stabilization alongside the standard 1080p/30 fps, a high-speed 1080p/60 fps and a 120 fps recording in 720p options. The front selfie camera has a 13-megapixel sensor (1/3.06\\") with 22 mm, f/2.0 lens, a 90-degree wide angle lens and SteadyShot with Intelligent Active Mode (5-axis stabilization). The Xperia XZ1 has the Triple Image Sensing technology that started with the Xperia XZ as standard. It is composed of the image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems, featuring a hybrid autofocus that utilizes Phase Detection (PDAF) to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, and also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking. It also has a laser autofocus sensor for fast tracking and locking focus on a subject, as well as an RGBC-IR (RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the surrounding environment. It also has SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the five-axis sensor-shift image stabilization first seen in the Xperia XZ. The Motion Eye Camera in the Xperia XZ1 also has Predictive Capture. When it detects fast-paced movement, the camera automatically captures a maximum of four photos before the shutter button is pressed, and lets the user select the best one afterwards. This is done without any user intervention and is possible due to the same built-in RAM chip on the image sensor used in capturing the 960 fps super slow-motion videos. The newest addition to the Motion Eye Camera of the Xperia XZ1 is a 3D scanning feature without the need of a dual-camera setup, a world first for Sony. It utilizes the IMX400's built-in DRAM to offload captured data before being combined and built up in the proprietary 3D Creator application, creating a near-perfect rendition of the subject, be it a face of a person, a whole head or any object the user may wish to capture. The user is then given the option to use the rendered 3D image on the included animated figures for a more creative approach or have it 3D-printed by Sony's approved 3D printing companies, all within the app itself. Battery The Xperia XZ1 is powered by a non-removable 2700 mAh battery. Charging and data transfer is handled by a USB-C port with support for USB 3.1. It also has Qualcomm's QuickCharge 3.0 and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery unit's lifespan. It also comes with Battery Care, a Sony proprietary feature, that controls the charging process of the phone by learning and recognizing the user's charging patterns, preventing the phone from damaging the battery's cells from excessive heat due to overcharging. For example, when charging overnight, Battery Care stops the initial charge to 90 percent and then continue charging until full where it left off the next day. Audio and Connectivity The Xperia XZ1 comes with a standard 3.5 mm audio jack for plugging in wired headphones. It also has improved LDAC, an audio coding technology developed by Sony, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 5 with aptX and Low Energy, NFC, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with 2x2 MIMO antennas, Wi-Fi Direct, screen casting via Miracast, Google Cast, DLNA, GPS (with A-GPS), GLONASS, BeiDou and Galileo satellite positioning. Like most flagships today, the Xperia XZ1 has no FM radio support. Software The Sony Xperia XZ1 is the first smartphone to launch with Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, along with Sony's famed minimalist approach to customizing its interface, Smart Stamina battery saving modes and multimedia apps.

According to chronicler Ziauddin Barani, 20,000 or 30,000 Mongols were killed as a result of this order.  Background  The Khalji dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate was of Turkic ethnicity and had fought several wars against the Mongol invaders from Central Asia. In 1292, the Delhi Sultan Jalaluddin Khalji had permitted several thousand Mongols to settle in his empire after they converted to Islam. These Mongol converts were called New Muslims (or Neo-Muslims), and by 1311, more than 10,000 of them lived in the capital Delhi alone. Several of them served in the Delhi army, and during the 1299 Gujarat campaign of Jalaluddin's successor Alauddin, some of them had staged an unsuccessful mutiny. After facing three other rebellions (not by Mongols), Alauddin had taken several measures to prevent further rebellions, including prohibition and confiscation of wealth from his subjects. His administration had greatly reduced salaries and inams (feudal land grants) of the Mongol amirs, and some of them had lost their employment. All these factors caused discontent among the leading Mongols of Delhi.  Conspiracy against Alauddin  In 1310-1311, Alauddin had sent his general Malik Kafur on a campaign to the southern Hoysala and Pandya kingdoms. During Kafur's invasion of the Pandya kingdom, his Mongol commander Abachi (or Abaji Mughal) conspired to betray the imperial forces and to kill Kafur. The plot failed, and Abachi was brought as a prisoner to Delhi, where Alauddin ordered him to be executed. Abachi's execution prompted the already- resentful Mongols to conspire against Alauddin. The conspirators made a plan to kill Alauddin when he would come out to fly his hawks, wearing a cloak without any armour. Alauddin's attendants at this time would be unarmed, so the Mongols thought that a contingent of 200-300 Mongol horsemen could easily overpower them. The conspirators planned to set up a government after killing Alauddin. They believed that the general public would support them for liberating the people from Alauddin's tyranny.  Alauddin's order  Before the Mongol amirs could put their plan into action, Alauddin's agents came to know about the conspiracy. Alauddin then issued a confidential order, instructing his royal officers to kill all the Mongol men in his empire on a specified day. The wives and children of the victims were to be handed over to the assassins. This event has been mentioned by the 14th century chroniclers Ziauddin Barani and Isami. The later chronicler Yahya also mentions the event in Tarikh-i-Mubarakshahi, but he confuses it with the Mongol mutiny during Alauddin's Gujarat campaign. A manuscript of Barani's Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi states that Alauddin's order was to kill the New Muslims who held jagirs (feudal land grants). However, the term jagir was not used in Barani's days, and seems to be a copyist's addition. Alauddin ordered all New Muslim men of Delhi Sultanate to be killed. According to Barani, 20,000 or 30,000 Mongol men were massacred as a result of Alauddin's orders. Their women and children were turned into destitutes. Most of the victims were unaware of the conspiracy against Alauddin. According to historian Peter Jackson, the victims of this massacre may have included Ali Beg and Tartaq, the Mongol commanders who had led the 1305 Mongol invasion of India. Isami states that after being defeated and imprisoned, they had been recruited into Aluaddin's service (probably because of their high ranks), but they were later killed on Alauddin's orders.

After graduating with the Gold Medal for 1950 from the University of Buenos Aires, she studied at Taliesin West with Frank Lloyd Wright and studied municipal planning in Canada, Great Britain and the United States. After returning to Argentina in 1964, she opened her own design studio at the University of Buenos Aires, working her way through the academic ranks to head the post-graduate research program in the architectural department, to finally Professor Emerita of the School of Architecture and Urbanism. At a time when few women were able to work in the field, Su√°rez was a pioneer and was committed to region-wide professionalism and scholarship. As an urban planner, she served as president of the City Council of Urban Planning for Buenos Aires and consulted on projects in Managua, Nicaragua and Puerto Madero. Her expertise led to a consultancy with the United Nations for planning and urban design throughout Latin America. Throughout her career, she won nineteen national architecture prizes and was one of the pillars of urban planning for Buenos Aires. Early life Odilia Edith Su√°rez was born on 12 November 1923 in Villa Mar√≠a, C√≥rdoba Province, Argentina to Luc√≠a and Marcelino Su√°rez. In 1944, she entered the University of Buenos Aires studying in the School of Architecture, where she met Eduardo Sarrailh, with whom she would become both a professional and personal partner. Before she finished her schooling in 1948, Su√°rez began working under the direction of Antonio Bonet Castellana and on the team studying the city plan for Buenos Aires. At that time, she developed two primary ideas, which she would later publish in her work, La Autonom√≠a de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires: Reflexiones desde un punto de vista territorial (The Autonomy of the City of Buenos Aires: Reflections from a territorial point of view, 1995): that urban planning must not only be strategic to satisfy needs, but must be dynamic to recognize that changes are, and have been, constant in an urban area. She graduated in 1950 with the Gold Medal for her class and continued her studies, traveling to England on a postgraduate fellowship offered by the British Council. In 1952 she went to Mexico City to write about the Eighth Pan-American Congress of Architects for Revista de Arquitectura and met Frank Lloyd Wright. She was invited to study in Arizona at Taliesin West for six months to further her education. Career Upon her return to Buenos Aires in 1953, Su√°rez joined Ferrari Hardoy's team, then called the Directorate of Urbanism, and worked on the proposal for the plan of the Bajo Belgrano neighborhood of Buenos Aires. The following year, Su√°rez and Sarrailh founded the Estudio Su√°rez-Sarrailh Asociados (Studio Su√°rez-Sarrailh Associates) and won the first prize in a contest to create the Colonia de Vacaciones (Vacation Neighborhood) for the Federation of the Meat Industry in the Calamuchita Department in the C√≥rdoba Province. The plan proposed a large complex developed on 250 hectares of land following the principals of organic architecture, which Su√°rez had learned from Wright. Though the plan was never implemented, the duo submitted a design for Newell's Old Boys Athletic Club and won first prize. Their design included a football stadium for 100,000 people, as well as an indoor stadium with a capacity to seat 10,000 spectators. It was not built at that time, but the plan was revived in 1978 for the Argentine World Cup stadium. In 1955, Su√°rez- Sarrailh won 5th prize for their proposal of a civic center complex for the city of C√≥rdoba and 4th place for a similar proposal for a civic center for Santa Rosa, La Pampa. Simultaneously, in her work for the Directorate, in 1956 she helped integrate the organization into an Urban Planning Department which focused on regulating the direction of city planning. She became the first woman to hold a chair in the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urbanism (es) (FAU-UBA) at the University of Buenos Aires in 1957 and began her teaching activities at that time. In 1958 she became a member of the Board of Directors for the newly created Organization of the Regulatory Plan of the City of Buenos Aires (). The organization focused on both academic evaluation and advisory capacities to the municipality for future development. That same year, Su√°rez-Sarrailh won the competition for their design of the Regulatory Plan of Mar del Plata and directed a proposal for the neighborhood Casa Amarilla, which integrated among the 15,000 homes pedestrian and vehicular districts to create both a functional and visual cohesion. Though not fully implemented, the plan created the districts of Catalinas Sur, and Lugano I and II, which later became significant parts of the urban plan. Between 1960 and 1990, Su√°rez won recognition in nineteen national architecture contests and served as a juror in more than fifty competitions. In 1963 Su√°rez-Sarrailh took first prize in the contest for the civic center for the Tres de Febrero Partido. Winning an Organization of American States (OAS) scholarship in 1964, Su√°rez returned to Europe and studied regional planning in Great Britain and Scandinavia. She also took further courses at York University in Toronto. In 1966 because of the military coup d'√©tat by Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, Su√°rez was forced to leave her position at FAU-UBA and on OPRBA. In 1967, she worked as an urban planning advisor to the Province of Buenos Aires and the National Development Council ). In 1969 she won the design competition for building the civic center of Colonia Catriel in R√≠o Negro Province, with her proposal which incorporated the use of environmental elements such as curtains of trees, ditches and mirrors of water to add interest to the bare and inhospitable appearance of the Patagonian Desert. She also designed a plan for Bah√≠a Blanca, which was developed between 1968 and 1971 and then from 1971 to 1973 worked on the technical aspects of the Urban Planning Code (), which was an update of the 1962 Urban Plan and attempted to update the obsolescence of the previous plan as well as develop a planning framework. For the next decade, Su√°rez predominantly worked on projects outside the country. Between 1973 and 1974, she served as a consultant to the United Nations on a plan for the reconstruction of Managua, after the 1972 Nicaragua earthquake. She designed the Guayaquil Development Plan and worked in Guayaquil, Ecuador between 1976 and 1977. Though she maintained her home in Recoleta, Buenos Aires, Su√°rez also kept a residence in Punta del Este, Uruguay during the military junta. In 1983, democratic government was re-established in Argentina and by 1985, Su√°rez was returned as the Design Chair at FAU-UBA. She was appointed as Secretary of Research and Postgraduate Studies and after eight years, was awarded the Gold Medal of the University in 1993, when she was named as a Professor Emeritus and granted a Doctor Honoris Causa from FAU-UBA. Throughout her career, Su√°rez published numerous books, articles and essays on urban planning, including Planes y C√≥digos para Buenos Aires 1925‚Äì1985 (Plans and Codes for Buenos Aires 1925‚Äì1985\\", 1986); Ampliaci√≥n del puerto de Buenos Aires-Apreciaciones urban√≠sticas (Extension of the port of Buenos Aires- Urbanistic appraisals, 1998) and Sistema aeroportuario comercial metropolitano (Metropolitan commercial airport system, 2000) From 1995 until her death, Su√°rez worked as a consultant on various projects and seminars, working as the director of the Center for Urban Documentation at FAU-UBA. Beginning that year, she worked with Lucila Oliver on a forum Ciudad and Rio (City and River), which evaluated the integration of plans for the city with those of the nearby river port development. Among other consultancies, she worked on a plan for the R√≠o de la Plata, drainage issues for the city because of the confluence of the Reconquista and Matanza River basins, transport and transit issues along the north-south coastal highway, airport policies, an environmental and development plan for Puerto Madero. Her concerns for the developmental problems focused on three main axes: balancing the need to expand services in the central city with the need for high-density housing, expanding development of the southern part of the metropolis to take pressure off of the northern and more developed areas, and better communication with citizens to integrate community concerns in the planning process. Death and legacy Su√°rez died on 11 August 2006. In 2014, her family donated her papers to the Archivo Hist√≥rico Sociedad Central de Arquitectos (Historical Archive of the Central Society of Architects) of Buenos Aires. The collection includes personal papers as well as drafts, drawings, photographs, working papers, writings, and other materials. After completion of the inventory and cataloging processes, the collection opened for public consultation.

Plotius Pegasus was a Roman senator and jurisconsult active under the Flavian dynasty. He was suffect consul in an uncertain year, most likely 72 or 73 AD, as the colleague of Lucius Cornelius Pusio Annius Messalla. Shortly after his ascension to the imperial throne, Domitian appointed Pegasus urban prefect, one of the most prestigious offices in a senatorial career.  Family  According to a scholiast on Juvenal, Pegasus and his brother Griphus were named by their father after ships he commanded as a trierarch, or naval commander. Professor Edward Champlin of Princeton University provides evidence to show that ships of the imperial fleet were often named after swift and powerful winged beasts. He makes the suggestion that their father should be identified with a \\"M.Plotius Paulus qui et Zosimus\\", whose tombstone was recovered at Rome. An inscription from Dalmatia mentions him, but it is broken where it contains his name: [...]tius Pegasus. Champlin makes a convincing argument that the best restoration for his gentilicium is Plotius, the same as his brother. There are some possible descendants of Pegasus or his brother. The cognomen of Lucius Plotius P[...], proconsul of Cyprus in 81/82, has been argued to be Pegasus, and thus the proconsul is very likely his son, although Ronald Syme has argued that the cognomen is actually Pulcher and is an otherwise unknown member of the Plautii Silvani.  Life  Prior to the Year of Four Emperors, Pegasus' life is unknown. Brian Jones, author of The Emperor Domitian, writes, \\"At all events, he and his brother were committed Flavians at the right time and, despite their comparatively humble background and possibly eastern origin, were amply rewarded.\\" The scholiast to Juvenal states that Pegasus was governor of several provinces, but the only one we have evidence for is Dalmatia from the year 70 to 73. One of the military tribunes of the Legio IV Flavia stationed in Dalmatia at the time was Gaius Petillius Firmus, the younger son of Quintus Petillius Cerialis; since governors often appointed relatives to hold the commission of one of the military tribunes in their province, this has led some to speculate that Pegasus is somehow related to the young Firmus. Juvenal notes in his Fourth Satire that Pegasus was so honest that people were astonished when they learned he was selected as Urban prefect.Satires, IV.77 However, the date he took office and how long he held it is uncertain. The Fourth Satire is set at the beginning of Domitian's reign, a dramatic date between mid-September 81 and Spring of 83. Pegasus' ethical reputation suggests he would not willingly have taken part in Domitian's notorious proscriptions against Senators that started in the year 91. Lastly, a number of personages were appointed Urban Prefect between the years 81 and 91 who must also be accommodated in that decade, including Marcus Arrecinus Clemens, Gaius Rutilius Gallicus, and Titus Aurelius Fulvus, listing them in the order Jones suggests they held the office. Champlin suggests \\"his absence from the voluminous extant works of Statius, Martial, and the younger Pliny (who was certainly familiar with all of the leading jurists of the day) suggests that he may have died not long after leaving office.\\"  As a jurisconsult  During his lifetime, Pegasus was considered \\"a iuris peritus of glorious memory, a walking encyclopaedia\\". He succeeded the namesake as head of the Proculian school of law. Jones speculates his suffect consulship followed soon after Nerva's, whose father and grandfather were also leading Proculians. Despite this reputation while he was alive, \\"not a single word of his writings survives. Indeed, but for notices in the Digest and in Juvenal and his scholiast, he would have been quite forgotten.\\" The Senatus Consultum Pegasianum, which addressed difficulties concerning inheritances not covered by the Senatus Consultum Trebellianum, was named for Pegasus.

The focus of this model was not only on the health of each patient with AIDS, but also on the well-being of each person. As AIDS was beginning to be treated as a significant epidemic, San Francisco General Hospital recognized the need to create new standards of care for a disease that had never before been experienced. Compassionate care has now become a priority worldwide and an expected standard in hospitals as there places a greater emphasis on the social, psychological, and economic aspects of treatment in addition to the medicine.  Gay liberation movement  As the gay liberation movement began to gain prominence following the Stonewall riots, gay pride and its affiliated political and social actions asserted the acceptance of homosexuals throughout major cities. With this new ideology, San Francisco became one of these many major centers for gay liberation groups. In 1980, 17% of the city's population was homosexual, and more were attracted to this city for its large gay network and supportive environment. The Castro district contained the majority of the gay population, and thus represented the epicenter of homosexuals in San Francisco. Away from the social stigma against them, this concentrated group of gay men participated freely in social rebellion, including liberal participation in sexual practices that were otherwise prohibited. Gay communes, or communal living systems, were also created to celebrate and publicly acknowledge their prideful acceptance of free sexual preferences. With many gay-friendly meeting places existing and a thriving population of gay men, gay bars and bathhouses were created as another hub for available social interaction.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=aph&AN;=110590583&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site  AIDS in San Francisco  AIDS first erupted within the gay population, initiating the quest to understand the disease that would soon become endemic around the world. A sexually transmitted disease, HIV was especially prominent within this city because of San Francisco's abnormal tolerance for sexual freedoms and gay-friendly places. Bathhouses were a major factor for the spread of this disease, as it acted as a sexual outlet for homosexuals to practice risky behavior. Thus, as one of the largest gay communities, San Francisco suffered from a large number of AIDS cases and had the greatest incidence of AIDS until 1994, especially within the more concentrated area of the Castro District. The inception of AIDS was initially thought to be contained within the gay population under the title of GRID (gay related immune deficiency). 71% of 3,064 reported cases were of gay and bisexual men; 12% of these cases were in San Francisco. Yet with the first infant case in San Francisco discovered by Dr. Art Ammann in 1982, fear began to spread throughout the remaining population as many realized the disease could also infect through blood contamination. As such, GRID was renamed to AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) in 1982‚Äî now encompassing the cases found in hemophiliacs, Haitians, and drug users. Because the CDC could only provide strong evidence that AIDS was an infectious disease, not proof, there was no way to alleviate public panic. Casual contact was considered a threat despite claims by Paul Volberding and other respected AIDS doctors because no proof was able to combat these fears. With homophobia, stigma, and a lack of knowledge for this disease, fear was a major motivating factor in interacting with AIDS victims. At San Francisco General Hospital, some doctors and nurses were unwilling to cooperate with or treat AIDS patients for fear of catching this disease, refusing to even enter an AIDS patient's room. For the gay community, this disease was rapid and terrifying. Friends and partners, once active and well, were now ill, unable to care for themselves, and dying. Not knowing how the disease was spread or what prevention methods were available, the gay community was unknowingly infecting itself and increasing the prominence of this disease in their population.  Care  AIDS patients were often ostracized and subjected to homophobic intentions and fear-induced actions. Many treated AIDS as a punishment for the risky lifestyle of the gay community. Consequences of infection included unemployment, increased homophobia, and exclusion. Ryan White, for example, was banned from attending school in his county due to the lack of knowledge and fear of his disease. A New York City TV station refused to interview an AIDS patient for fear of catching this disease. As such, the harsh stigma associated with this disease could also result in a denial for medical treatment in order to avoid the hateful stigma directed towards them. Such stigma thus accelerated the social death of those infected. Excluded from the community and denied the respect of a living person, AIDS infected patients were considered and treated as dead while still alive. This treatment resulted in a lack of will to live, suicidal intentions, and denial for treatment in order to avoid the implications of social death.  The model for AIDS care  Because AIDS was a multidisciplinary disease, requiring attention in the medical, psychological, and social fields, a new approach had to be made in order to care for AIDS patients. In addition, the majority of AIDS patients were young adults suddenly subjected to the responsibilities of death and the harsh realities of social stigma. As such, hospitals could no longer maintain only the responsibility of medical care, but also adopt different psychosocial support systems. AIDS introduced the social and psychological implications of a disease amidst the many physical aspects that one may inflict. AIDS patients introduced not only biological, but also psychological, social, and political factors‚Äîsuch as discrimination, isolation, and poverty‚Äîinto a clinical setting, thus eradicating traditional measures taken to treat disease, and forcing clinics and hospitals to expand their resources to cover these new multidisciplinary requirements. Specific needs for AIDS care continuum include: * Self care (personal care, buddy program, attendant) * Care of home (homemaker-chore worker) * Food (home delivered meals) * Residential care (board and care, congregate housing) * Transportation * Socialization (social day care) * Altering home environment in response to functional limitations * Special care for dying (hospice, counseling, psychiatric care, legal services) * Medical service at home * Continuous nursing care * Emotional psychological problems * Legal and financial planning * Employment counseling * Emergency response * Protection from abuse Consideration of these topics is essential in understanding the model of care necessary for those patients inflicted with this disease. This model may also be used to improve the care in other disease. In obtaining substantial progress to accomplish these new requirements, volunteer organizations were essential to this cause. Support systems were created by organizations as a response to those suffering from this disease. A large impact of these organizations was providing support and personal contact to a patient that was normally met with discrimination. Extra attention on people with AIDS helped them feel welcomed and important to a society that victimized and ostracized them. Volunteer organizations also reduced costs for already limited hospital funding. The Shanti Project, in addition to providing buddy programs and counselors, teamed up with the city and county of San Francisco to arrange low cost housing options for AIDS patients. In this way, the city leased housing units to Shanti and thus allowed patients to live under the care of Shanti and other agencies. By living in these provided housing units, patients were also able to create support systems within them, thus decreasing the need for inpatient services. As such, hospitals were able to reduce costs by increasing outpatient management with the help of volunteer agencies. Other organizations include The San Francisco AIDS Foundation, which provided financial and social assistance, food donations, and education programs through community forums discussing AIDS therapy, sexual risk reduction, and AIDS virus antibody testing. This program also provided aid through telephone hotlines and physical referrals. The Hospice of San Francisco and the Visiting Nurse Association provided in-home and special care, allowing patients to reduce overall hospitalizations and maintain the option of having an at-home death. People with AIDS Alliance was a network of AIDS patients that emphasized the importance of people with AIDS as vital members of their communities and not as victims. This program supported AIDS patients by advocating and providing education, recreational programs, retreats and support groups for them. In addition to established organizations, professionals would volunteer time to assist patients. Interior designers created comfortable spaces, legal workers helped make wills, florists provided flowers, and other people would donate food, games, and toys for the patients and their families. Specific support groups were available to meet any circumstance, for example, groups for inpatients, Hispanic women, or the transgender community; they were also available for the care-takers, burdened with the death toll of so many patients. As a result, it became essential to adopt this new form of care‚Äî focusing on the social and psychological implications of this disease. Mobilization against AIDS includes caring for the sick, and increased involvement‚Äî not only on stopping the infection itself.  The San Francisco Model  Paul Volberding was one of the first to notice the sudden increase in Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) cases in young gay men. In time, he learned the correlation between this cancer and AIDS infection, and thus began his career with AIDS patients. As an oncologist, he was also able to recognize the emotional toll the disease inflicts upon these patients, and was aware of the psychosocial care that would be required of them. In this way Volberding was one of the first to help implement this new and necessary model of care‚Äîmultidisciplinary and directed towards patients' well-being. Dubbed the San Francisco model of care, this model removed the social death of AIDS by directing attention and care towards the patients as humans‚Äînot as helpless victims. Priority was now given to patient advocacy, care, and education rather than on the sole concern of avoiding death. This model of care was first recognized in wards 86 and 5B, respectively the outpatient and inpatient wards of San Francisco General Hospital. Both were created with the intention to improve the care directed towards AIDS patients. Outpatient clinic ward 86 was co-founded by Volberding and was initially started as a KS clinic at UCSF. Yet surrounded by fear and homophobia, patients in this clinic were neglected by caretakers, rejected, and treated poorly‚Äîsubjected to appalling treatment, patients were forced to change their own sheets, food was left outside instead of brought into rooms, and floors hosting AIDS patients were avoided. In addition, UCSF hospital feared exposing other patients to this disease and labeling their renown hospital as a center for disease. As such, Volberding's KS clinic was moved to San Francisco General Hospital where it then received its current name of ward 86. Recognizing the expense of hospitalizations and the hardships of this disease, this outpatient ward provided AIDS patients with an environment that was responsive and conducive to the accompanying struggles of their disease. Inspired by the model of care demonstrated in ward 86, an inpatient clinic‚Äîward5B‚Äî was created in 1983 to implement similar values for care. Cliff Morrison, a nurse and advocate for AIDS patients, was responsible for creating this ward. Originally opposing the creation of a separate unit, Morrison wanted to diminish stigma and discrimination towards these patients by keeping them with other patients in the hospital. Yet with ongoing fear and homophobic hostilities, it became apparent to create an AIDS specific unit for the AIDS patients and staff where proper treatment could be expected and not hoped for. Ward 5B was specifically lead by volunteer nurses to ensure genuine care as a passion and not a burden. Demands of this job were incredibly high‚Äîemotionally and physically‚Äî as the majority of patients died, and lack of funding did not allow for nurses to be paid for all the hours worked. Yet because of this voluntary system, ward 5B supported an environment of sincerity and humane care‚Äî attention directed towards patients and not only on the medicine. Both wards demonstrated a holistic approach towards care. Physicians were no longer in charge, but teams of people‚Äî social workers, physicians, nurses, volunteers, nutritionists, and mental health staff ‚Äîcollaborated for the patients‚Äô benefit. The clinical approach to this disease emulated oncology models, requiring a strong infrastructure of nurses and social support. Exceptions were made for patients‚Äîvisitor hours never ended, items from home were brought to the patients‚Äô rooms‚Äî often because supervisors were unwilling to get involved with the novel ward and the risks associated with it. Yet because of these changes, patients were given more control over their medical decisions and hospitalization. (lauren Kim users) Originally a county hospital, it was common for San Francisco General to receive inmates or homeless patients‚Äîthose with less resources. As such, those without insurance, first attending Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic, would receive care until conditions worsened enough to merit a visit to San Francisco General Hospital (academia article), whereas those with insurance went to UCSF hospital. Thus, middle, middle-upper class patients were less willing to receive care from this county hospital, but because of the model of care demonstrated within this hospital, San Francisco general became a sought-after establishment rather than a last-resort place for the poor and uninsured.  Caregivers  Caregivers played an essential role in this model of care. As noted, they acted as an emotional and social outlet for patients isolated from normal human contact because of their disease. AIDS, in this way, was and still is a nursing disease. Nurses provide for the opportunistic infections, mental well- being, and social health of the patient‚Äîseeing more patients, and initiating interactions with them, nurses and not doctors remained the most experienced in AIDS care. Not only did caregivers provide for complex mental and social needs, but also for simple chores such as laundry, cooking, cleaning, and organizing appointments. Care was also provided through informal social networks‚Äî support among people who could understand the true reality of AIDS, and who are accepted as a person and not a burden to be abandoned. The trust, concern, and compassion freely provided by these caretakers were essential for the emotional well-being of AIDS patients, especially for those unaccustomed to reaching out for help.http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AN;=9508080089&db;=aph&site;=ehost- live&scope;=site People often chose to become a caregiver as a responsibility to care for a family member, lover, or friend. Others volunteered with the hope of helping others through advising or supporting. Yet both nurses and patients were placed in undesirable positions. The patient, forced to cope with this disease, and the nurse, forced to cope with helplessness. A caregivers job was difficult in that they were responsible for a dying patient‚Äî his mood swings, associated stigma, and oncoming death. In effect, nurses often were unable to sleep, emotionally numbed by the pain suffered by these patients, and physically drained from the chores required of them. Because AIDS patients were often in the same age group as the caregivers‚Äî an age categorizing healthful youth‚Äî it was especially difficult for nurses to watch patients die. As a result, emotional support groups are also necessary for these social and emotional outlets for AIDS patients‚Äî those suffering from care-related depression.http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&sid;=1e51a17c-f4e7-4910-9bcd-f41fbd8c5ea6@sessionmgr4007 The continuance of this model is reliant on the prominence of caretakers. In this way, training the next generation of caretakers must include rotation through HIV units and experience with the many stages of HIV care in order to ensure this model of care remains within hospital settings.  A Future Model  The UNAIDS 90-90-90 target is aiming to have 90% of people living with AIDS knowing of their diagnosis, 90% of those infected being treated, and 90% of those on treatment suppressing their virus by 2020. With this goal in mind, the model of care has been readily adopted by cities to facilitate this intention. By understanding the importance of outpatients clinics, cities are able to adopt this model by providing resources necessary for those who are no longer in need of acute inpatient care, but are still in need of emergency housing, longer-term housing, hospice care and support systems‚Äî programs made possible by implementation of this model of care. As such, there is also an economic benefit with this model in that organizing care for patients can reduce a hospital stay and allow for the patient to be cared by the volunteers and organizations associated with this model. With the many variations among different cities, this model itself will not be identical nationwide, but rather the idea of care and intentions for the actions facilitated by this model will be recognized among the many variations that will exist. Created in 1988, the University of Alabama's 1917 clinic is modeled after the San Francisco model of care. A community based clinic that prioritizes patients, it is able to focus on the needs of patients rather than only on the implications of medicine. In this way, the clinic has placed a greater emphasis on helping the low income and uninsured population‚Äîstigmatized as marginalized and unimportant to society. One method for monitoring patients in order to maintain viral suppression and consistent use of medication is through electronic medical records. As a result, 71% of the patient population had a virally suppressed load in 2012‚Äî similar to that of San Francisco General. Though the homosexual population is still the most affected in terms of size, there has been an increase in AIDS infections among African American and Hispanic gay and bisexual men. In this way, the current model of care is emphasizing a focus on minority and marginalized populations and not only on the white homosexual population of San Francisco in 1983. The fight to eradicate the effects of stigmatization and discrimination directed towards AIDS patients remains constant, though the focus must expand to include other populations that are infected. The model now includes addressing the health of disadvantaged populations and not only on the maintenance of community involvement and emotional support. In this way, it may not only advance public health, but also social justice. Thus, the future of this model must now depend on the responsiveness of the health care system in order to ensure that current at-risk populations will continue to use these programs and remain in them. Health care must address medical discrimination and unsatisfactory experiences in order to ensure the continuance and effectiveness of this model of care. The different implications of marginalized populations must be considered in continuing this model, adding greater emphasis on mental and health substance abuse services, or increasing the involvement of family members. In addition, this model of care must now adapt to an older generation of patients. As the young AIDS patients of the 1980s are now able to live longer with ART treatment, PReP, and a possible future vaccination, these create different circumstances that must be considered. With AIDS infecting a greater variety of people, more resources and a broader outlook will be needed in order to maintain this model of care.

In innovation helical framework theory, each sector is represented by a circle (helix), with overlapping showing interactions. The initial modelling has advanced from two dimensions to show more complex interactions, for example over time. The framework was first theorized by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff in the 1990s, with the publication of ‚ÄúThe Triple Helix, University-Industry-Government Relations: A laboratory for Knowledge-Based Economic Development‚Äù.

The triple helix innovation framework has been widely adopted and as applied by policy makers has participated in the transformation of each sector.  Three components of the model  The triple helix model of innovation, as theorized by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, is based on the interactions between the three following elements and their associated ‚Äòinitial role‚Äô: universities engaging in basic research, industries producing commercial goods and governments that are regulating markets. As interactions increase within this framework, each component evolves to adopt some characteristics of the other institution, which then gives rise to hybrid institutions.

Therefore, interactions between university and industry revolve initially around those two elements. In a linear model of innovation, universities are supposed to provide the research on which industry will build upon to produce commercial goods. The other interactions take place through the involvement of industry managers and university faculty in both sectors. According to Etzkowitz, the transfer of people between university and industry constitutes a very important transfer of knowledge. This can be a permanent move in one direction or the other, or in other cases, entire careers spent between the two spheres. He gives the example of Carl Djerassi, a research director for a pharmaceutical company who joined Stanford University while continuing his industrial activity. However, other scholars have pointed out that consulting activities of faculty members could also have drawbacks, like a reduced focus on educating the students, and potential conflict of interests relating to the use of university resources for the benefit of industry. Additional transfer of knowledge between university and industry happens through informal communication, conferences or industrial interest in university publications. Another type of interaction, for example, is the creation of co-op programs like the MIT-General Electric course which aims at integrating an industry approach into the students' curricula.  University-government interactions  The strength of the interactions between the government and universities depends on the government's general relationship to and policy towards higher education. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff's model uses a spectrum to define the extent of these interactions. On the one hand, when higher education is largely public, as in continental western Europe, the government has a higher influence on universities and the research they conduct by being the main source of funding. On the other end of the spectrum, typically associated with the United States, universities still receive some government funding but overall have a higher degree of independence from government influence. However, the two ends of this spectrum are used as ideal-types that are not necessarily reflective of the reality. The changing circumstances can push the government to create closer ties with academia, for example in wartime, and/or through funding of strategic disciplines, like physics. For example, in the United States, the Department of Defense has extensively funded physics research during World War II and the Cold War. Another example of state involvement in higher education is the establishment of new universities, as through the Morrill Land-Grant Acts of 1862 encouraging the creation of land-grant colleges. Cornell University, the University of Florida and Purdue University are three of the seventy-six institutions created under the land-grant.  Government-industry interactions  The relationship between governments and industry depends on the government's attitude towards the market. In liberal economies the role of the government will be limited to preventing market failures. On the other hand, where the government is more involved in the economy, the government's role is the regulation of the industry. These are also two ends of a spectrum, leaving room for substantial variation, based on circumstances and disciplines. For example, as pointed out by Bhaven Sampat, in the 1960s, the government created a regulation to prevent patenting by or licensing to industry of university research funded by the National Institutes of Health. One key role of the government in its interaction with industry is the establishment of intellectual property law and its enforcement.  Strength of interaction  Figure 1:Triple Helix Interactions in a Developing Country (Silo Confinement) Figure 2:Beginning of Triple Helix Strategic Interactions in a Middle Income Country (Push-Pull) Figure 3:Triple Helix Strategic Interactions in a Developed Country (Red Indicates Science Park) Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff initially argued that the strength of the interactions between governments, industry and university depends on which component is the driving force in the framework. In a statist model, a strong state is driving interactions between the three components in a top-down implementation. It creates stronger ties and a more integrated model. In a laissez-faire model, in which the industry and market forces are the leading forces, the ties are weaker and each institution tends to remain very independent. However, the distinction between the two models is not always clear cut, as the government can choose to adopt a strong or a weak stance depending on the context and the industry. Strength of interactions can also vary according to the development of a country, with a silo model predominating in an underdeveloped country, moderate interactions developing in a middle-income country due to the push for economic growth on the one hand and the pull for a competitive market-driven technological advancement on the other, and strong interactions developing in a developed country, for example in the form of a science park. In a recent paper, Etzkowitz emphasized that the shift towards a knowledge-based society has given a bigger role to universities. Indeed, as innovation is increasingly based on scientific knowledge, the role of universities as creators of knowledge is more valued. As a result, he argues that university, industry and government are more equal, and that no particular element is necessarily the driving force of the triple helix model of innovation.  Evolution and hybridization  The triple helix model of innovation also blurred the boundaries of the traditional basic roles of university, industry and government. According to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, this marks the second step in the triple helix of innovation framework. For example, universities increasingly take part in commercial activity through patenting and licensing, moving beyond the production of basic research. The next step is the emergence of intermediaries between the three elements as well as the hybridization of the three entities. Nevertheless, each entity retains a strong primacy in its original field of expertise: the university remains the main source of knowledge production, industry is the primary vehicle of commercialization and the government retains its regulatory role. Technology transfer offices have been established by universities to foster the transformation of university basic or applied research with a commercial value into commercial goods. One of the aims of TTOs is to create some revenues for the university, thus enhancing its role as an economic actor. However, the average profitability of TTOs remains very low. For example, the revenues earned through the licensing of patents by TTOs in American universities are, on average, ten times larger than for European TTOs according to the Innovation Policy Platform. Science parks have also emerged as the result of the collaboration of industries and universities with the government. They can stem from the initiative of an industrial region to modernize itself with the impulse of a university. On the other hand, they can be the result of a university initiative to attract industry, as was the case with the development of Stanford's science park around the university or the Research Triangle in North Carolina. The 'entrepreneurial university' is another hybrid element which Etzkowitz defines around the following elements: the capitalization of knowledge, strong ties with industry and governments, a high degree of independence, and permanent evolution of the relationships between universities, industry and government. Etzkowitz recognizes MIT as a great example of an 'entrepreneurial university‚Äô.  Extensions of the model   Quadruple helix model  Building on the triple helix model, the quadruple helix model adds a fourth component to the framework of interactions between university, industry and government: the public, consisting of civil society and the media. It was first suggested in 2009 by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell. The framework aims to bridge the gaps between innovation and civil society, and it claims that under the triple helix model, the emerging technologies do not always match the demands and needs of society, thus limiting their potential impact. The framework consequently emphasizes a societal responsibility of universities, in addition to their role of educating and conducting research. The quadruple helix is the approach that the European Union has intended to take for the development of a competitive knowledge-based society. Subsequently, the quadruple helix has been applied to European Union-sponsored projects and policies, including the EU-MACS (EUropean MArket for Climate Services) project, a follow-up project of the European Research and Innovation Roadmap for Climate Services, and the European Commission's Open Innovation 2.0 (OI2) policy for a digital single market that supports open innovation.  Quintuple helix model  The quintuple helix model was co-developed by Elias G. Carayannis and David F.J. Campbell in 2010. It is based on the triple and quadruple helix models and adds as fifth helix the natural environment. The quintuple helix views the natural environments of society and the economy as drivers for knowledge production and innovation, thus defining socio-ecological opportunities for the knowledge society and knowledge economy, such as innovation to address sustainable development, including climate change. The quintuple helix can be described in terms of the models of knowledge that it extends, the five subsystems (helices) it incorporates, and the steps involved in the circulation of knowledge. How to define both the quadruple and quintuple helices has been debated, and some researchers see them as additional helices, while others see them as different types of helix which overarch the previous helices.H√∂glund, Linda; Linton, Gabriel (2017-12-27). \\"Smart specialization in regional innovation systems: a quadruple helix perspective\\". R&D; Management. 48 (1): 60‚Äì72. doi:10.1111/radm.12306. ISSN 0033-6807.  Triple helix and policy making  Figure 4: DOE National Laboratories‚Äô Relationship to Universities and Industry in the Energy Innovation System The triple helix model has been used as a lens through which evolving relationships between university, industry and government can be analyzed. However, according to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, it can also be a policy making tool. It has been applied for both purposes by government organizations, such as the United States Department of Energy. Etzkowitz argues that after the end of the Soviet Era, triple helix inspired policies were implemented in Eastern Europe to promote their growth. In Sweden, the triple helix policy aimed at tying together innovation initiatives at different scales to increase their overall efficiency. The triple helix model has also been applied to developing countries and regions.  Criticism of the model  The triple helix model as a policy-making tool for economic growth and regional development has been criticized by many scholars. One main criticism is that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff's framework was developed within Western developed countries, which means that it is based on a particular set of infrastructures and under circumstances. For instance, the model takes for granted that knowledge intensive activities are linked to economic growth, that intellectual property rights will be protected, and that the state has a democratic and market oriented culture. Further scholarly criticism of the model focuses on the conditions that enable the implementation of a triple helix innovation policy. It argues that Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff's model is too vague and takes for granted those necessary preconditions within their model. Therefore, according to critics, the triple helix model is not a relevant policy making tool for developing countries where at least one of these conditions is missing. However, others have argued that the triple helix model is capable of both describing the situation in developing countries and is useful for planning policy.

Literature professor Thomas J. Ferraro calls her \\"the first significant Italian American woman novelist.\\" Tomasi also worked as a journalist and local historian, and served a term in the Vermont House of Representatives.  Biography   Early life and education  Mari Tomasi was born on January 30, 1907, in Montpelier, Vermont, the third of five children of Bartolomeo and Margarita Tomasi. Her parents were immigrants from Turin in Northern Italy who owned a grocery and cigar store in Montpelier. Tomasi was born with a disability and walked with a limp; she was taken to Burlington, Vermont, as a child for corrective surgery, which was partially successful. Originally aspiring to practice medicine, Tomasi attended Wheaton College in Norton, Massachusetts, and Trinity College in Burlington, Vermont, but left school to work as a journalist.  Career  She wrote for newspapers and magazines, and became city editor of the Montpelier Evening Argus. She also worked for the Vermont Federal Writers' Project, interviewing the people of Barre, Vermont, about their lives during the Great Depression; the resulting collection of interviews, titled Men Against Granite, was published posthumously in 2003. One of her literary mentors at this time was Arthur Wallace Peach. Her first novel, Deep Grow the Roots (1940), sold few copies but received positive reviews, and earned her national recognition as an emerging writer. Set in the Piedmont region of northern Italy, it depicts the tragic effect of fascist militarism on the life of two young peasants, Luigi and Nina. Tomasi had stayed in that part of Italy as a child while recovering from surgery, and had never forgotten the experience. The book received positive reviews from Dorothy Canfield Fisher, Mary Ellen Chase, and Faith Baldwin, among others. Tomasi was one of ten new novelists selected that year by the American Booksellers Association and the New York Herald Tribune to be honored at the Hotel Astor. On the strength of that novel, she also received a Bread Loaf Writers' Conference fellowship in 1941. Writing in 1975, critic Alfred F. Rosa was unimpressed with the novel, citing problems with structure and pacing and describing the ending as \\"contrived.\\" In 1999, Helen Barolini wrote that although the reviews were positive, the early reviewers, who had described the book as quaint and even pastoral, seemed to have missed the point. The story, Barolini argues, \\"is tougher than that.\\" Tomasi received another fellowship in 1948 that allowed her to finish her second novel. Like Lesser Gods (1949) depicts the hardships and dangers faced by the Italian stonecutters of Granitetown, a fictionalized version of Barre. The novel grew from a short story, Stone, first published in Common Ground in 1942. In this novel, presumably influenced by her work for the Federal Writers' Project, Tomasi shifted to a brisker, more realistic writing style. It was chosen as Book of the Month by the Catholic Literary Foundation, and was taught for many years in Vermont schools. Although she published no more novels, Tomasi continued to write articles and short stories, and was active in the Poetry Society of Vermont. She was Associate Editor of Vermont Life for two years. She also edited the Vermont State Welfare magazine, and three volumes of Vermont: Its Government. In December 1949 she was appointed to the Vermont House of Representatives to complete the term of Fred Gleason, who had died. Her term ended in January 1951.  Personal life  Sometime after college, Tomasi changed her name to Mari (pronounced \\"Mary\\") because she thought her given name, Marie, sounded \\"too foreign.\\" Tomasi was a devout Catholic all her life. She never married, but lived at her family home at 63 Barre Street until she died of cancer on November 10, 1965. Her papers are on file with the University of Vermont.

She was the first practical woman designer in the United States. Cory took up designing in 1877, being led to it by the sight of ugly carpets. After a course of theory in Cooper Union, she visited representative factories of the United States, and became familiar with the practical end of the business. She became a designer of wall paper, woolens and silks, as well as carpets. In 1878, Cory taught an afternoon class of 17 women pupils in Cooper Union the art of designing practically for carpets. This was the first class as far as known ever formed to teach practical industrial design to women. In 1880, Cory taught a class of practical design in the Woman's Art Association on Fourteenth Street in New York; and in 1881, she founded the School of Industrial Art and Technical Design for Women, 134 Fifth Avenue, New York. Early years and education Florence Elizabeth Hall was born in Syracuse, New York, June 4, 1851. She was a daughter of Johnson L. Hall. She came of American Revolution ancestry and traced her descent back through those on her father's side, who won distinction worthy of historical mention in the War of 1812, and more notedly in the battles of Monmouth and Stony Point in the American Revolutionary War, to General Isaac Hall and to Col. Harry Hall. Her education was of that sort so commonly sufficient for the average society girl, but wholly inadequate to meet her great desire of becoming independent. Career At the age of 19, she married Hon. Henry W. Cory, of St. Paul, Minnesota, but in two years, returned with her only child, a girl, to reside with her parents. In spite of the fact that she had loving parents and a home replete with all the comforts and luxuries that money and refinement bring, her longing to do for herself could not be conquered, and she was continually casting about for some occupation in which to find support and, possibly, distinction. Industrial designer Florence Elizabeth Cory Cory first wished to become a designer for carpets, having made up her mind to that effect by seeing an ugly carpets and wondering why more beautiful ones were not made. She could find anyone to tell her where she could learn anything of the kind, or even where carpets were made. She looked in the encyclopaedia, but found very unsatisfactory instructions there, telling merely that carpets were made in the United States, but not where they were made or how. During the centennial year, while looking through a pile of papers filled with illustrations of the Centennial exhibits, among others was one of the carpet department at the Centennial Exposition. This drawing was made with divisions; over each division was the name ‚ÄúYonkers,‚Äú \\"Hartford,\\" ‚Äú Lowell,\\" and so forth. She took the first, which happened to be Hartford, and wrote a letter to the Hartford Carpet Company, asking if designs were in demand, how much was paid for them, how they were made, whether one was restricted in color, and where she could procure the paper on which to make these designs. They were much pleased with the idea of a woman designing. Cory seemed to be the first who had thought of it. Reune Martin, the agent of the Hartford Company, who wrote her, said that as women bought carpets, he thought it a good thing for women to design them, as they would know best what women liked. He sent me as full instructions as he could by letter, five designs to look at, and several sheets of paper. She made three or four designs and sent them to him. They were returned to Cory as being imperfect, but Martin thought with instruction, Cory might be able to please their firm, and advised her attending Cooper Union in New York. That was in the spring, and she found she could not enter the institute till the autumn. During the summer, she employed her time constantly in studying the structure of fabrics by unraveling them and in making original designs, one of which was accepted by a prominent manufacturer, and she was paid US$15; it was the first money she had earned. On entering Cooper Union in the fall, she found that her instructors knew the principles of design and could teach them well, but could not at that time teach any practical method of applying those principles to an industrial purpose. She began a course in drawing, of which she felt a great need. She also made time to visit the carpet departments in the principal stores in New York and finally found the information she wanted, that is, where the carpets were made, and by whom they were made. She found a number of agents in New York, most of them in Worth Street. She went to Worth Street and first called upon William Burrage Kendall, president of the Carpet Trade Association of the United States, and agent of the Bigelow Carpet Company. He was pleased with Cory's idea, and sent her with a note to the head designer at the Higgins Carpet Factory in the city. The head designer offered to give Cory six weeks‚Äò free instruction. At that time, she was still a pupil at Cooper Union, and by the time she had taken this practical instruction, Cooper Union thought Cory competent to teach a class. She subsequently visited the representative factories of nearly every art industry in the United States and thoroughly familiarized herself with the technicalities of design and workings of machinery in each. After spending three years in the West, she returned to New York City and established herself as a practical designer. In a short time, she received more work than she could do. Teacher She became an instructor in Cooper Union in the art she had herself come there to learn but a few months before. She had a class of 17 girls and women, which was the first of the kind ever taught in the United States, and possibly in the world. That position she was obliged to resign on account of ill health. In 1881, Cory taught a small class at the Ladies‚Äò Art Association rooms in New York on Fourteenth Street. At that time, she was not a teacher, nor did not profess or intend to be one. She was a designer, and earned her living in that way. There seemed to be such a demand, so many women who wanted to know how to design, so many who were trying to learn at Cooper Union and other schools, meeting with the same difficulties Cory had encountered, and who, hearing of her, asked Cory to help them. She helped hundreds of women in three or four years, by giving them instructions and hints, teaching them as well as she could until there came so many, she could not attend to her business and decided to found a school, which she did in 1881, classifying the pupils, and confining them to regular hours, so that she had leisure for her other business and to teach besides. By a system of home instruction, Cory taught pupils in every State and Territory in the United States, and several foreign countries. Cory was a member of the society of the Daughters of the Revolution, of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and of the Daughters of 1812. She was President and Treasurer of the School of Industrial Art and Technical Design for Women, at 159 West Twenty-third Street, New York. Amputation and death About six weeks before Cory's death, a tiny red spot appeared on one of her fingers. She noticed it first by finding herself dreading to shake hands with anyone. An infection of the fingertip pulp was lanced, but proved more serious after development of gangrene in the right arm. First the finger and then the entire arm were amputated in an effort to save Cory's life. She died in New York City, March 20, 1902, at the Post-Graduate Hospital.

Viacom put a caveat in the agreement that the principal photography of any of the films must start by 8 June 2017, else the rights would revert to Viacom. Soon after the announcement in June 2014, several Indian directors and actresses expressed their desire to do the film, but Thiagarajan maintained that no one had been finalised and that he was still considering his options. Thiagarajan announced his potential plans of casting Lisa Haydon to reprise her supporting role and for his son Prashanth to act in the film, but remarked that he was unsure if Prashanth would accept to play a character with \\"grey shades\\". Samantha held discussions about portraying the film's lead role during July 2014, but turned the film down after being unconvinced about the way the original script was set to be adapted into the South Indian regional languages. After a period of inactivity and further media reports about the casting of the lead actress, Thiagarajan revealed in February 2016 that he had signed on Revathi to direct the Tamil version of the film, while Suhasini would work as the dialogue writer. Soon after, Nayanthara turned down the opportunity to work on the film citing scheduling issues during early 2016. In mid-2016, Trisha was also approached to play the lead role but conflicting schedules meant that she could not sign on to appear in the film. The media also linked actresses Parvathy and Nithya Menen to the lead role, but neither were signed on. During an interaction with the media in November 2016, Thiagarajan revealed that he had finalised Revathi to direct the Tamil and Malayalam versions of the film, while Anish Kuruvilla and Prakash Raj would make the Telugu and Kannada versions respectively. He added that Tamannaah would feature in the lead role of the Tamil version, while Amala Paul and Parul Yadav would reprise the role in the Malayalam and Kannada versions respectively. He also stated that Amy Jackson was signed on to feature in all four versions of the film in the role originally portrayed by Lisa Haydon. In April 2017, Tamannaah stated that the film was shelved, though Thiagarajan refuted her claim and stated that production would begin in May 2017. He revealed that talks with the actress to play the lead role had fallen through after a dispute over her remuneration for the lead role. In June 2017, further confusion about the remake arose after two separate production houses apart from Thiagarajan's Staar Movies had claimed rights to the film. As per a contract signed on 30 July 2016, Staar Movies agreed to enter into a co- production agreement with Mediente International Films Ltd and Liger Commercial Brokers for the making of the films. However a mutual cancellation form was then signed between the parties on 5 April 2017 after Mediente allegedly failed to pay the consideration provided under the agreement. Then, as per a contract signed on 21 April 2017, Staar Movies agreed to assign the rights of all four South Indian versions of Queen to Golden Crab Film Production Ltd. In order to avoid the reversion of rights back to Viacom due to three years of inactivity, Staar Movies and Golden Crab swiftly began shooting the film on 17 May 2017 with a series of supporting actors including Nassar under the title of Vaanil Thedi Nindren. However, on 3 June 2017, Staar Movies again assigned and transferred the remake rights of the film to Mediente and Liger, with the Kannada version of the film titled Butterfly (2018) featuring Parul Yadav, starting immediately with Ramesh Aravind taking over as director. Staar Movies then produced a declaration affidavit on 14 June 2017 that any agreement with Golden Crab Films was false. Kajal Aggarwal revealed in August 2017 that she had agreed terms to play the lead role in the Tamil version of the film, which would also be directed by Ramesh Aravind and produced by Mediente, and that the film's shoot would begin in September 2017. In September 2017, it was revealed that Tamannaah would work on the Telugu version of the film which would be directed by Neelakanta. Amala Paul also opted out of the Malayalam version citing date issues and was later replaced by Manjima Mohan. Amy Jackson was initially in talks to play the role Lisa Haydon played in Queen however opted out due to unavailability of dates and creative differences. Filming began on 2 November 2017. Two months later, Neelakanta left the film, and was replaced by Prashanth Varma. However, Neelakanta soon decided to direct the Malayalam remake titled Zam Zam with Manjima Mohan in the lead.  Soundtrack  The music of the film is composed by Amit Trivedi and lyrics are by Krishna Kanth. The songs were released under Zee Music Company on 1 September 2020.

He is best known for his seminal role in the development of polyelectrolyte multilayers, which is today known as ‚Äúlayer-by-layer (LbL) assembly‚Äù, a simple yet powerful nanofabrication method that has enabled the development of entirely new technologies, such as biocompatible coatings on medical devices, ultrastrong nanocomposites, neural interfaces, charge-storage devices, gas separation, fire retardants, and gene delivery platforms. According to CNRS International Magazine, Decher's work has ‚Äúsparked a small revolution in materials science‚Äù. Layer-by-layer assembly is now an established part of the nanobiotechnology curriculum. Decher's work on the self-assembly and buildup of multilayer films by alternating application of anionic and cationic components during the early 1990s is generally credited for the revitalization of the layer-by-layer assembly technique and its current prevalence in nanoscience. His 1997 article on ‚Äúfuzzy nanoassemblies‚Äù published in Science Magazine highlighted the potential of layer-by-layer assembly, and was identified by ISI as 8th most cited among all journal articles in chemistry in the decade 1997‚Äì2007. This article has been cited over 8000 times as of March 2019. Over his career, Decher's research has focused on the layer-by-layer assembly method, macromolecules at interfaces, nanocomposite (bio)materials, (bio)functional nanoparticles, functional coatings, thin-film devices and nano-organized multi-materials in general. His current research is centered around the assembly of multi-nanocomposites with complex anisotropies. Education and academic career Decher studied chemistry at Philipps Universit√§t, in his hometown of Marburg, Germany. Prior to completing his Diploma thesis with Gernot Boche on the NMR spectroscopy of carbanions, he spent a year working with William Russey at Juniata College in Pennsylvania. In 1986 he obtained his PhD in organic chemistry from Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany, working in the laboratory of Helmut Ringsdorf on drug-carrying polymers and lyotropic liquid crystals. He then took up a position as a postdoctoral fellow at Ciba-Geigy AG in Fribourg, Switzerland, where he worked with Bernd Tieke on non-centrosymmetric Langmuir- Blodgett films. From 1988 to 1994 Decher was an Assistant Professor with Helmuth M√∂hwald at Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, where he began his research on the development of layer-by-layer assembly as part of his Habilitation in physical chemistry. From 1994 to 1995 he was Visiting Professor at Universit√© Louis Pasteur in Strasbourg, France, and was promoted to Full Professor of Chemistry in 1995. His research laboratories are located at the CNRS Institut Charles Sadron in Strasbourg, France, where he served as Deputy Director from 2001 to 2009. He was appointed Distinguished Professor by Universit√© Louis Pasteur (now Universit√© de Strasbourg) in 2006. Professional achievements Decher is a member of the International Center for Frontier Research in Chemistry (ICFRC) and of the excellence cluster ‚ÄúNanostructures and their Environment‚Äù, both in Strasbourg. He is also a Senior Member of the Institut Universitaire de France (IUF). Further distinctions awarded to Decher include the Emilia Valori Grand Prix of the Acad√©mie des sciences (France) for Nanobiotechnology in 2009, the ECIS‚ÄìRhodia European Colloid & Interface Prize in 2010, and the International Award of the Society of Polymer Science Japan in 2013.

It is one of the oldest and most distinguished centres for the study of classical languages, literature, thought, religion, art, archaeology and history in the United Kingdom.  History  Foundation Echoes of Hellas title page (1887) King's College was established in 1829 under the patronage of George IV. Its royal charter outlined its mission as \\"the general education of youth in which the various branches of Literature and Science are intended to be taught, and also the doctrines and duties of Christianity [...] inculcated by the United Church of England and Ireland.\\" The College counted among its founders and benefactors the Duke of Wellington, who was Prime Minister at the time, and a number of other eminent politicians and theologians of the British Establishment. The College included a Chair of Classical Literature as part of its foundational setup. Classical subjects, along with Law, Literature and Theology, were therefore taught at King's from the day it first formally opened its doors in 1831. The inaugural Professor of Classical Literature was the English scholar Joseph Anstice, whose introductory lecture on the enduring significance of classical education marked the inauguration of what is today the Classics Department. The Tale of Troy The Tale of Troy is the title given to a series of famous performances in London between 1883 and 1887. George Charles Winter Warr, Professor of Classical Literature from 1879 to 1901, developed an adaptation of the Iliad and the Odyssey entitled The Tale of Troy. Four performances were scheduled in late May and early June 1883, two in English and two in the original Greek. The goal was to raise sufficient funds to secure premises in Kensington for the newly founded King's College Lectures for Ladies.https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/classics/about/hist/troy.aspxhttp://www.kingscollections.org/victorianlives/v-z/warr- george-charles- winterhttp://www.academia.edu/20013758/Professor_Warrs_Tale_of_Troyhttps://www.jstor.org/stable/29737302https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/10539399 Although originally planned on a modest scale, the end product was a lavish spectacle staged in the South Kensington mansion of Sir Charles and Lady Freake. The plays were attended by prominent figures in scholarship, art, music, theatre and high society. The production was revived in May 1886, this time to raise funds for the extension of university teaching in London. This expanded version was moved to Prince's Hall in Piccadilly and included the story of Orestes, adapted from Aeschylus's Oresteian Trilogy. The Prince and Princess of Wales were also in attendance. The complete final version was published in 1887 under the title Echoes of Hellas with illustrations by Walter Crane.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical- review/article/echoes-of-hellas-by-profgeorge-c-warr-with-illustrations-by- walter-crane-london-marcus-ward-co-1887-4-4s/F7233BD7943A47D7C63588FBE4B45C2A The Koraes Chair Adamantios Koraes The Koraes Chair of Modern Greek and Byzantine History, Language and Literature was established at King's College in 1918 to serve as the British focus for Hellenic studies beyond antiquity. It was championed by the likes of the Anglo-Hellenic League and Eleftherios Venizelos, then Prime Minister of the Hellenic Parliament and a close friend of King's College Principal Ronald Montagu Burrows. Burrows was himself a famous classical scholar and philhellene. The Koraes Chair is named in honour of Adamantios Koraes, the founding father of the modern Greek nation state. Its inauguration also marked the beginning of the Department of Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, which has itself since been merged into the Department of Classics. The Koraes Chair is currently held by the Belgian- American scholar Gonda Van Steen. Second World War The Parthenon sculptures were hidden directly under the department in the tunnels of Strand station during the Second World War. They were only brought back to the British Museum in nearby Bloomsbury in 1948, where they have remained since. The work of the original Chair of Classical Literature was split into two separate Chairs of Greek and Latin at this time. Modern Era The Centre for Hellenic Studies (CHS) was established at the Department in 1989 to promote research and scholarship of Hellenic history, culture and language. On Greek Independence Day in 2010, plans were announced for the CHS to include teaching alongside its research activities. Under these new arrangements the CHS also came to incorporate the Department of Byzantine & Modern Greek Studies. A public dispute arose in 2010 over plans to axe the last Chair of Paleography in the United Kingdom and wider English speaking world. Principal Rick Trainor announced the controversial plans as part of a College restructuring project. The issue was debated as an Early Day Motion in Parliament. The British parliamentarian Boris Johnson visited the College in 2011 as Mayor of London to deliver a speech on the importance of classical education. In 2014, the Centre for Hellenic Studies merged its teaching and research activities with the Department of Classics. The CHS continues to be a prominent research centre of its own in the Arts & Humanities Research Institute (AHRI).  Location  169 Strand The Department of Classics is located on the historic Strand. It occupies a set of buildings at the corner of Surrey Street which are linked internally through a series of corridors and staircases. 169 Strand was purpose-built for College use in 1928 above the disused Strand tube station, and features the old coat of arms on its facade. The Royal Strand Theatre stood on this site from 1832 until its demolition in 1905. 170 Strand contains offices, teaching rooms and the department common room with a balcony overlooking the street. 171 Strand is a corner house with retail operating on ground floor level. Academic offices extend along 39 to 41 Surrey Street. The King's College London Rifle & Pistol Club (KCLRPC) have occupied the Strand underground tunnels beneath the department as their shooting range since the 1920s. The vaults at the rear of the Surrey Street buildings house the old Roman Baths on Strand Lane.  Reputation  The work of the department is rated highly in various rankings. In the most recent Research Excellence Framework (2014), the department ranked 3rd in the United Kingdom for research power. The Complete University Guide ranks the department at 11th nationally. QS World University Rankings ranks the department at 5th nationally and 21st globally.  Traditions  The King's Greek Play has been an annual tradition since 1953. It is the only dramatic production in the United Kingdom to be performed every year in the original ancient Greek language. The production has also previously toured America and Canada. The Department of Classics houses a physical archive of related materials and recordings. Every year on the first Thursday of February, the department hosts its annual Runciman Lecture named in honour of Sir Steven Runciman. The lectures were established in the early 1990s and funded in perpetuity by the Czech count and artist Nicholas Egon. The event is traditionally preceded by an Orthodox Vespers in the College Chapel on the Strand.http://www.ekathimerini.com/37493/article/ekathimerini/life/peter- brown-to-deliver-runciman- lecturehttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/ahri/centres/chs/publications/chsnewsletter-2017-18.pdfhttps://www.kcl.ac.uk/events/event- story.aspx?id=adacbfe2-bb0d-46fb-a052-1bfe146d9269 The Jamie Rumble Memorial Fund was established in 2013 through a major donation from a former student. The Rumble Fund sponsors field trips where students have the opportunity to engage directly with the classical lands in their studies. Travel destinations have so far included Athens and Rome, with future trips to sites in Cyprus, Sicily, North Africa and Turkey proposed. The Rumble Fund also subsidises an annual guest lecture in classical art. The Department of Classics also supports the Iris Project, an educational charity designed to promote study of the classical world to state schools in the United Kingdom. Students in the department have the opportunity to teach Latin to disadvantaged children. Student life in the department is administered by the Classics Society (formerly the Classical Society). The Society publishes a journal titled the New Satyrica. A new undergraduate research journal, Kerberos, was also launched in 2018. There is a common room at 170 Strand which previously housed the departmental library. The Classics Society hosts an annual Winter Ball.

The Quinault Canyon is visible, below it, and the Juan de Fuca Strait, above it. East is Washington state; Canada is north. Juan de Fuca Channel is a submarine channel off the shore of Washington state, United States and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The geography of Juan de Fuca Channel The Juan de Fuca Channel is a submarine canyon running from the shelf break, off southern Vancouver Island to Juan de Fuca Strait. The canyon is both narrow and deep and has sides that are steep. Over its width at the rim it drops from in depth to over deep at the thalweg. Along a track, seismic profiles over Juan de Fuca Channel show the canyon consists of two distinct parts. The upper canyon is narrow, extending southwestward down the continental slope. This area has an average gradient of . It is there carved in consolidated or semi-consolidated material of the slope. The lower part of the channel trends northwestward, parallel to the shelf edge, with a gradient of only , terminating at the apex of Nitinat fan. The lower channel represents a small fan and valley feature. Further, Nitinat Fan was constructed on the deep-sea floor at what is the presently the terminus of Juan de Fuca Channel. Most of the shelf break canyons from Oregon and north cross only part of the continental shelf, and cut from the shelf break toward the coast. Then well below the mixed layer, they end on the continental shelf. Different from other aquatic canyons, the Juan de Fuca Channel cuts the continental shelf and continues into the Strait of Juan de Fuca The amount of water in the channel The Juan de Fuca Channel carries more water than the Amazon River. And the Amazon is Earth's biggest river, by discharge volume of water. The Juan de Fuca Channel reaches to the opening of the Juan de Fuca Strait, which separates the United States and Canada. The canyon is just less than wide and at least deep, that is, twice the depth of the surrounding seafloor. More detail For decades, it has been known that 20 to 30 times more deep water flows into Puget Sound than from all Earth's rivers combined, far bigger than the Amazon River. This flow is towards land, not away. New (as of 2017) measurements show this canyon may supply most the water coming into Puget Sound, the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Canada‚Äôs Georgia Strait. The pattern of water circulation sends a dense lower layer of ocean water towards land, while the upper layer flows out to sea. Its role Juan de Fuca Channel appears to be a pathway, bringing deep Pacific water into the Salish Sea. Life within Puget Sound has famously rich water. There is reason for this; the channel pulls nutrient-rich water from the deep ocean. Recent measurements (as of 2017) may explain why this canyon helps the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs inland waters support so many shellfish, salmon runs and even pods of whales. Water surges up the channel, mixing at surprisingly high rates. The intense flow and mixing measured inside the Juan de Fuca Channel may help explain the formerly mysterious productivity of the shores of Washington; coastal winds usually bring in some nutrients, but the numbers don‚Äôt add up: \\"Washington is several times more productive ‚Äì has more phytoplankton ‚Äì than Oregon or California, and yet the winds here are several times weaker. That‚Äôs been kind of a puzzle, for years,\\" observes Matthew Alford, an oceanographer with the University of Washington's Applied Physics Laboratory. At below the surface, water has flowed as fast as , showing mixing up to 1,000 times the normal rate in the deep ocean. The flow is hydraulically-controlled, which means it flows smoothly over a shallow ridge just off Cape Flattery then on the other side forms a turbulent breaking undersea wave, mixing with surface water far above. The deep water forced up through the channel is rich in nutrients, which support the growth of marine plants, which then feed other marine life. The water is more acidic, and lower in oxygen, both of which contribute to water conditions in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Fishing in the Juan de Fuca Canyon \\"The location of this sill would be an outstanding place to fish,\\" observes Matthew Alford, the oceanographer with the University of Washington‚Äôs Applied Physics Laboratory. \\"People fish in Juan de Fuca Canyon pretty actively, and that‚Äôs probably no coincidence.\\" See also Nearby submarine canyons All of the following submarine canyons are near, headed north to south: * Barkley Canyon * Clayoquot Canyon * Father Charles Canyon * Loudon Canyon * Barkely Canyon * Nitinat Canyon * Juan de Fuca Canyon * Juan de Fuca Trough * Quileute Canyon * Quinault Canyon * Grays Canyon * Guide Canyon * Willapa Canyon * Astoria Canyon Local geography * Abyssal fan * Astoria Canyon * Astoria Fan * Cascadia Basin * Cascadia Channel * Cascadia Margin * Cascadia Subduction Zone * Grays Canyon * Juan de Fuca Canyon * Juan de Fuca Plate * Juan de Fuca Channel * Nitinat Canyon * Nitinat Fan * Quileute Canyon * Willapa Canyon References External links and references * One link * A geography link * Submarine canyon flow feeds Strait of Juan de Fuca like an underwater Amazon River * Research on the Juan de Fuca Canyon * More research * Article from the San Francisco Chronicle Coastal and oceanic landforms ","title":"Juan de Fuca Channel"},{"id":"55381832","text":"Emery Oleochemicals (M) Sdn Bhd is a Malaysian oleochemical company. Emery operates production plants in Malaysia, the United States and Germany. Its products serve a wide range of industries, including agriculture, heavy industry and consumer products. The company is a 50:50 joint venture between Malaysian agriculture group Sime Darby Plantation and PTT Global Chemical of Thailand. History Emery traces its origins to 1840, when Thomas Emery began converting lard discarded by meat producers in Cincinnati into candles and lamp oil. In 1887, the Emery Candle Company was incorporated. From then, the company underwent expansion and diversification, most notably under the stewardship of John J. \\"Jack\\" Emery, Jr. (grandson of founder Thomas Emery) and was renamed Emery Industries. Jack Emery headed the company until 1968, and was the last of the family to run the business. In 1978, Emery Industries was merged into National Distillers and Chemical Corp. In 1989, the business was acquired by Henkel and became part of its Chemicals Group. Henkel Chemicals Group was later renamed Cognis and was spun off by Henkel in 2001. In 2006, Cognis transferred its global oleochemicals business to Cognis Oleochemicals, a 50:50 joint venture between Cognis and Golden Hope Plantations of Malaysia. The business's headquarters were moved to Teluk Panglima Garang (near Banting) in Malaysia. Golden Hope subsequently underwent a merger with Guthrie and Sime Darby in 2007, with the enlarged group retaining the Sime Darby name. Cognis sold its 50% stake in the company to PTT Global Chemical in 2008. Following the exit of Cognis, the company revived the \\"Emery\\" brand name and was renamed \\"Emery Oleochemicals\\". Business Emery is a producer of commodity and specialty chemicals made from natural oils and fats. It is one of the largest oleochemical manufacturers in the United States, along with Vantage Specialty Chemicals. Emery's products are organized into six business units: Agro Green, Bio-Lubricants, Eco-Friendly Polyols, Green Polymer Additives, Home and Personal Wellness, and OleoBasics. The company's main production plants are in Teluk Panglima Garang, Cincinnati, Ohio and Loxstedt, Germany. Cincinnati and Loxstedt also house the group's technical development centers (TDCs). Its D√ºsseldorf plant and operations was sold to another Malaysian agriculture group, Kuala Lumpur Kepong, in 2015.

The first Lebanese migrants to arrive to Brazil was in 1882, with the majority of them being Maronite Christians from Mount Lebanon. In 1920, Brazil opened a consulate in Beirut to facilitate Ottoman (Lebanese) emigration to Brazil. By 1914, over 60,000 Lebanese had immigrated to Brazil. In October 1945, Lebanon obtained its independence from France and in November 1945, Brazil recognized and established diplomatic relations with Lebanon. In 1954, Lebanese President Camille Chamoun paid an official visit to Brazil, becoming the first Lebanese head of state to visit Brazil. Later that year, both nations opened embassies in each other's capital's, respectively. Between World War I and World War II, a second wave of Lebanese migrants immigrated to Brazil. The last wave of Lebanese immigrated to Brazil during the Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990).

Its summit reaches a height of 276 or 300 m above sea level according to different sources and its depth varies between 3 and 20 m. The island is the result of intense ancient volcanic activities. In between 20 minutes and half an hour, one can reach the island by renting a boat at the Juque√≠ and Barra do Una beaches. There are no beaches there, but access is made possible with an improvised pier.  Tourism and wildlife  Mont√£o de Trigo Island is a fine place for both free and scuba diving. The best season for the activity is the summer, when the waters' temperature rises and visibility improves. Windsurf is another popular activity there. The local sea life is not very rich, but the island still offers caves and holes in its area where tourists can find pargos, badejos, grouper, lobsters, salemas and French angelfish, in couples or alone.

GoEco - Volunteer Abroad for Ecological & Humanitarian Projects. Retrieved on October 03, 2017  Economy  Almost all the island's inhabitants make a living out of artisanal fishing, since trawling is forbidden. In the past years, the fishes population have been decreasing, and by 2013, fishermen captured 1/6 of what they used to capture in 2005, due to the competition with bigger boats. However, in 2018, the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment limited the capture of mullets at the southern and southeastern coasts of Brazil, allowing for more of these fish to be found at the waters surrounding the island; in fact, by July of that year, eight tons of mullets were fished around the island. Some families make some extra money by selling handicrafts.  Infrastructure  1612 map of part of the coastline of the states of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with the island's location, still called \\"Monte de Trigo\\" at the time (Wheat Pile). The island is at the beginning of the sharp turn taken by the coastline in the drawing. For the last three centuries, the island has been permanently inhabited by cai√ßara families (around 52 in January 2012, a number that remained unchanged in March 2013 and in January 2014; the locals are known as \\"monteiros\\"), who earned in early 2012 permission to occupy and explore the island, which still belongs to the government, but will no longer be subjected to real state projects. The permission is part of a program by the federal government which aims to benefit small villages with native people throughout the country. The permissions are called TAUS - Termo de Autoriza√ß√£o de Uso Sustent√°vel (Term of Authorization of Sustainable Use). Normally, they are given to river villages in Northern Brazil; this was the first time an island population received such benefit. With the TAUS, the locals can request improvements such as sewer, drinking water and housing programs. The local population lives with little infrastructure: there's no electricity, so they live on batteries. There's no sewer system and many houses have no toilets, so the locals urinate and defecate in external dry toilets or simply in the woods. In 2012, no doctor had visited the island for two years. There's only one school which teaches up to the fourth grade (fifth since 2010), which has a bedroom for the teacher to spend the nights and only go back to the continent on the weekends.

Because of circumpolar regions' past as colonised territories inhabited by nomads, circumpolar studies focusses on indigenous peoples as well as early agricultural settlers.  Information  Circumpolar studies is the interdisciplinary study of regions located on and above the polar circle. As such, circumpolar studies embraces wider than Arctic studies, which deals with the Arctic sensu stricto. Classified as regional studies, circumpolar studies finds a parallel in European studies, African studies, Latin American studies, and so on. Gaining increased prominence in the wake of post-Cold War initiatives like the Arctic Council, circumpolar studies is maintained as an independent field of study by universities like the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Nord University and recognised as ditto by publishers like Berghahn Books. Based on a degree model developed by the University of the Arctic, over twenty educational institutions in circumpolar regions offer circumpolar studies at undergraduate level, including bachelor's degrees and short-term programmes. There is also a French university offering circumpolar studies at graduate level.

The wing became active on 15 August 1947 at Biggs Field, Texas, with the 47th Bombardment Group as its operational unit. On 1 February 1948 Biggs was turned over to Strategic Air Command, forcing a relocation of the wing to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana in November. In the fall of 1948 North American B-45 Tornado bombers began to be delivered to the wing, which became the first in the Air Force to fly the aircraft.Knaack, p. 72 However, the B-45As were not truly operational, because they lacked both fire control and bombing equipment.Knaack, pp. 74‚Äì75 The Air Force planned to equip five groups with the B-45, but in programming the units that would comprise its forty-eight group structure authorized in 1948, the number of light bombardment groups flying the B-45 was reduced to one. With this reduction, the Air Force decided to inactivate the 47th wing and transfer its B-45s to the 3d Bombardment Wing in Japan. However, the first B-45As delivered to the wing lacked sufficient range to ferry across the Pacific and they were too large to send on board available ships. The additional high cost of maintaining its B-45 aircraft led the Air Force to inactivate the 47th on 2 October 1949. However, the 84th and 85th squadrons of the 47th Bombardment Group kept their B-45s and moved to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia where they were attached to the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing.Maurer, Combat Squadrons. pp. 291‚Äì292Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 294‚Äì295Ravenstein, pp. 191‚Äì194 Flightline photo of B-45A-5-NA Tornadoes of the 47th Light Bomb Wing, Langley Air Force Base, Va., before trans-atlantic flight to Sculthorpe, England, in July 1952.Identifiable aircraft are (nearest to farthest) 47-082, 47-089, 47-050, 47-061, 47-058, 47-081, 47-059, 47-064.

The game was never released outside of Japan. However, an unofficial English translation has been made.http://projects.mattsmessyroom.com/ladysword/ Gameplay The game's format is first-person, much similar to Dungeon Master or the Might and Magic franchise. The combat is turn based with traditional RPG elements, although they are limited with several distinctions from now-traditional RPGs. Unlike traditional RPGs, a complete level-up system is not provided in the game, making the player oblivious to what experience level they are on. Another distinction is that when the player's health gets low, then healing is only available by way of resting. However, a dangerous dream monster known as Dream Flayer will occasionally appear to attack the hero while sleeping. The player starts off without a map of the dungeon, although an item named Faun Fresco can soon be picked up to help the player find their way through the Tower of Faunus. There are additional items, which include the Beezleboule, a magical skull-like device that helps the player detect fake walls, the Tachyo-Stone, which lets the player create their own waypoint, and the Polytron, that teleports the player direct back to that waypoint. Every floor of the tower has several protectors (which are mainly Elemental Spirits) that must be defeated in order to advance floors. Certain protectors can only be defeated by way of particular items. Failure to find and use the necessary weapon will only result in death for the hero. Plot A mysterious swordsman named Kenshi is traveling through the deadly cursed labyrinth Tower of Faunus, on a search for a powerful weapon known as the Lady Sword - and a young lady who was kidnapped and locked away in the tower by inhabiting monsters. In addition to finding the missing lady and the powerful sword, there are Ten Maidens who were kidnapped by the monsters, and are trapped within the tower themselves. Providing assistance to Kenshi is Weintein, a white wizard, and another swordsman named Palermo. Additionally, the souls of maidens who were slaughtered by the monsters will telepathically contact Kenshi periodically.

History The station opened in November 1940 to serve Small Arms Ammunition Factories Nos. 3 and 4 at Hendon during World War II. The station was located east of Tapleys Hill Road and was an island platform with sidings but the track was single for the entire length. After the war, rail traffic declined and passenger services at Hendon were reduced to morning and afternoon peak-hours only, providing services to residents and workers of factories established in the old munitions factories, including Philips Electrical Industries and the South Australian Brush Company. Ownership was transferred from the Commonwealth Government to South Australian Railways in 1951. Passenger trains to and from Hendon ran through to Woodville or Adelaide, and after the end of World War II, the Hendon trains only operated at industrial shift-change times. In spite of low passenger numbers the service continued operation until 1 February 1980, after which the line was closed and removed.\\"The Hendon Branch Line\\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin September 2002 pp323-327 There is no evidence of the station or track left, and the trackbed of the Hendon branch now forms part of the eastern end of West Lakes Boulevard, a main approach road to the suburb of West Lakes and the Westfield West Lakes shopping mall.

As an intelligence officer he was an early proponent of the Brandenburgers, commanded unconventional warfare operations in the Sudetenland, and was an active conspirator against Hitler's agenda. He was later reassigned to the regular army following his criticism of war crimes committed by German forces in Poland. After commanding an infantry battalion in the invasion of France he assumed a variety of staff roles. He was involved in the events of the Bila Tserkva massacre where he attempted to avert the killing of Jewish children. He ended his active service as Karl Strecker's Chief of Staff in the 11th Army Corps. He participated in the Battle of Stalingrad and helped draft the final message from the German forces trapped there. After the surrender he contracted typhus and died while in Soviet captivity. The recovery of his diaries and papers provided a significant source for historians researching the early resistance to Hitler within the German military.  Early life  Groscurth was a devout Protestant and conservative nationalist, born in L√ºdenscheid to German theologian and priest, Reinhard Groscurth(de). His older brother, also named Reinhard, was a German lawyer who worked against corruption and Nazi influence in the Evangelical Church of Bremen. Groscurth joined the German 75th Infantry Regiment in 1916 and fought on the Western Front where he was severely wounded and taken as a POW by the British the following year. After the war he transferred to the Reichswehr and then left the military to pursue studies in agriculture. He rejoined the Reichswehr in 1924 and in 1929 was appointed as the adjunct to Erwin von Witzleben, a fellow anti-Hitler conspirator who would go on to be executed for his participation in the 20 July plot.  Military intelligence officer  He was recruited into the Abwehr in 1935, eventually becoming an active conspirator in the extensive network of officers within military intelligence who were part of the German resistance under the direction of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris. In 1938, Canaris assigned Groscurth, now a Major, to head the Abwehr II, the \\"Minorities and Sabotage\\" section of the military intelligence service responsible for unconventional warfare in foreign countries. Canaris feared the growing power of the SS in such operations, particularly its influence over Konrad Henlein, and so he sent Groscurth to the Sudetenland in the run up to the planned annexation of the Sudetenland to prepare a pro-German fifth column under the control of the Abwehr. His mission included strengthening moderate ethnic Germans in the area in the hope that a negotiated solution could be found and a war avoided. He collected intelligence on Czech defenses, planted secret arms dumps, and trained potential insurgents in sabotage. These activities angered Reinhard Heydrich and the SD, who were working to aggravate tensions in order to justify an invasion. As a part of the larger strategy of taking the Sudetenland, Hitler wanted the British to be as distracted as possible when Germany forced the issue. To this end, Canaris and Groscurth traveled to Baghdad for a secret meeting with Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. Afterward Groscurth coordinated a weapons smuggling operation on behalf of Arab forces fighting the British in the Arab revolt in Palestine. Groscurth's plan set up an underground route for German weapons to be sent to by sea to Lebanon and then loaded onto local Arab fishing boats, which ferried the weapons to Palestine. Despite some successes by Abwehr elements, Henlein was greatly impressed with Hitler's victory in the Austrian Anschluss and decided to side with the radicals backed by Heydrich. Once the Germans occupied the Sudetenland, Heydrich turned on Henlein by undermining his power and murdering or imprisoning many of his friends and allies. Terrified, Henlein's wife begged Groscurth to protect them from the SS, which Groscurth and the Abwehr tried to do, with limited success. Although Henlein was not killed outright, he was removed from the proximity of power and was allowed only to live because of the personal relationship he had built with Hitler. After his assignment in the Sudetenland, Gorscurth successfully advocated on behalf of his subordinate Theodor von Hippel's proposal to form the Brandenburgers within Abwehr II. Groscurth was replaced by Erwin von Lahousen and promoted to be the chief of Abteilung Heerwesen zbV, a newly-created liaison unit between the Abwehr and the OKH. The new position proved to be key in his coordination of anti-Nazi activities between military intelligence, the regular army, and the German diplomatic corps.  Chief of Abteilung Heerwesen zbV  Canaris used Groscurth's new unit as a way of giving intelligence directly to senior army commanders, with the intention of combating the growing influence of the SS and its expanding intelligence capabilities. Groscurth's new duties made him extremely well-informed and connected. He used his position and the contacts that came with it to further the resistance to Hitler and the SS, including becoming one of the primary co- ordinators between the various elements of the Oster conspiracy. On the behalf of Canaris, he acted as the handler for Josef M√ºller's covert mission to the Vatican to secure the Pope's support for the overthrow of Hitler. He went so far as to secure explosives for an assassination attempt. During the missions Groscurth took extensive notes for operational reference and to provide evidence of resistance to Hitler for posterity if they failed. Additionally, Groscurth was active in maintaining communications between the anti-Hitler elements in Germany and the Chamberlain government in Britain. The communications attempted to create a deal with the British to ensure the Allies would not attack Germany if Hitler could be deposed. After Himmler provoked outrage in the Wehrmacht with his directive that SS men should breed as many children of \\"good blood\\" as possible, regardless of the marital status of the mother, Groscurth actively and publicly campaigned to have the order rescinded. In December 1939, Groscurth traveled throughout the Western Front during the Phoney War, disseminating reports and memorandums of atrocities committed during the invasion of Poland passed to him by a fellow objector Johannes Blaskowitz in an attempt to convince commanders there to act against Hitler. He visited Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, Erwin von Witzleben, Gerd von Rundstedt, and Fedor von Bock, but only Leeb was willing to take any official action by authoring a complaint to Hitler. That overall effort proved to be unsuccessful and, along with his open criticism of SS policies, created pressure on the Chief of the Army Walther von Brauchitsch from Himmler and other sources, leading to Groscurth's eventual dismissal from military intelligence by January 1940. He was then reassigned to command an infantry battalion in the West, where he took part in the invasion of France.  Army staff officer  After France he became the General Staff Officer for the 295th Infantry Division. In August 1941, Groscurth attempted to prevent the execution of approximately 90 Jewish children in Bila Tserkva. Groscurth became aware of the children's situation after several Heer soldiers confronted the SS Sergeant in charge of guarding a church locked full of crying children who had been recently orphaned by the execution of their parents. After being turned away by the SS, the soldiers went to their chaplains, who in turn went to Groscurth. On 8 August 1941, Groscurth reported his concerns to the Chief of the General Staff of Army Group South, General Georg von Sodenstern. Although Sodenstern took his report, he told Groscurth that he was unable to intervene. Groscurth continued his objection all the way to Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau at a meeting in the field commander's office on 21 August 1941. Reichenau echoed the position of the local SS Feldkommandant(de), Josef Riedl, who \\"regarded the extermination of Jewish women and children as absolutely necessary.\\" Also present was Paul Blobel, the head of Einsatzgruppe C, who responded by saying any commanders in the army who objected should be made to carry out the executions themselves. Some reports assert that Groscurth was then beaten although Groscurth did not mention that in his own report on the matter. The next day, the SS took the children out to a mass grave where they were all shot by the Ukrainian auxiliaries. To the displeasure of Reichenau, Groscurth filed an official report with the army, protesting the killings as inhumane and demoralizing for the army troops in the vicinity, calling it \\"a horror\\". The criticisms that Groscurth made in his report were, however, directed exclusively at the failure by local commanders to carry out such mistreatment and killing of children away from German troops, some of whom had already been disturbed by the children's \\"whimpering\\". Groscurth's report did not officially object to the children's plight itself but the inefficiency of the process and the potential detrimental effect on the fighting spirit of nearby German soldiers. Despite his public rebuke, Groscurth was promoted to colonel and appointed Chief of the General Staff for XI Army Corps, commanded by Karl Strecker, which was subsequently committed to the Battle of Stalingrad. As the situation of the 6th Army in Stalingrad deteriorated, Groscurth again became convinced that the only way to avoid calamity was to remove Hitler. To that end, he asked a friend, Major Alred von Waldersee, to travel to Berlin and contact officers who might listen and act. Waldersee first met with Friedrich Olbricht and Ludwig Beck. Beck advised Waldersee to travel to see Carl-Heinrich von St√ºlpnagel in Paris as well as solicit Gerd von Rundstedt for support. His efforts proved fruitless. Groscurth and Strecker were the last senior German officers trapped in the city to surrender their command and, on the morning of 2 February, drafting the final communication sent by the 6th Army and signing it \\"Long Live Germany!\\" That was an intentional deviation from the standard \\"Heil Hitler,\\" although the signal was changed before it reached Hitler himself, to include a \\"Long live the F√ºhrer!\\" Strecker, Groscurth and the rest of the 6th Army were taken as prisoners-of-war and marched to labour camps in the Soviet Union. Groscurth was placed in an officer's prison camp in Frolovo, where he later died of typhus.  Legacy  Groscurth was one of the first Army officers to join the resistance and became known, along with Oster, as the \\"soul of the Resistance within the Abwehr\\" since the summer of 1938. After the war Groscurth's diary was published, revealing his role as one of the key members of the Oster Conspiracy. He was also one of the authors of a secret memorandum written in October 1939 titled, \\"An imminent disaster,\\" with diplomats Hasso von Etzdorf and Erich Kordt, outlining a potential coup against Hitler. His diaries and the documents that he saved gave important insights for historians into the workings of the early resistance to Hitler by conservatives and military officers, as well as the process of the eventual submission of the Wehrmacht to Nazi policies and SS atrocities. His papers from handling M√ºller's secret activities in Rome also provided a substantial body of evidence on the correspondence between the German resistance, the British government, and the Vatican. Historian Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen described Groscurth as \\"a determined opponent of Nazism\\".

Company history  Twipe was founded in 2011 by Danny Lein and is based in Leuven, Belgium. Twipe's first clients were in Belgium, including the daily newspaper De Standaard, which was named 'App of the Year' by The Mobile Revolution for its newspaper app. De Standaard also launched a digital-only evening edition with Twipe. In 2014, it was Twipe's NextGen publishing platform that was used for the creation of \\"De Media App\\", a publication looking at the Flemish media sector. Twipe is active in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and the Nordic countries. Twipe's weekly blog was named one of the 'top new media and publishing sites', by State of Digital Publishing, who wrote that their articles focus on \\"providing insights around membership subscriptions and content development for better- paid content strategies.\\" The name Twipe comes from a combination of touch and swipe.  Products  Replica publishing allows newspaper to automatically generate an interactive version of their newspapers available on mobile or tablet, through responsive web applications, as well as native iOS or Android applications. NextGen publishing creates mobile-optimized version of newspapers through partially or fully automated templates, which can integrate additional content such as games and videos. EngageReaders is an analytics tool that uses a predictive model developed with KU Leuven and imec to give newsrooms a view on their newspaper‚Äôs performance, and translate it into actionable analytics. In 2018, it was given top prize from the Big Data & AI for Media Association for Excellence in the Use of Predictive Analytics. magazine.live allows individual and corporate publishers to create their own digital magazines, newsletters, and event guides.  Innovation  Reader attached to sensors for digital reader engagement research. In 2016, Google announced part of its Digital News Fund would be allocated to the EngageReaders project submitted by Twipe and Mediahuis. EngageReaders was one of the 128 winners chosen in that funding round. This joint project aimed to improve the daily production process of newspapers through the integration of scientifically-researched engagement insights. The research for this project was conducted in partnership with Mediahuis, imec, and two research groups at the KU Leuven in 2015. As part of the project, a panel of 60 people were watched while reading digital editions, and had their pulse, skin conductance, body temperature, and eye movements tracked, which allowed for a predictive model to be built. The study found that a strong reaction in the body is provoked when reading a digital edition. JAMES - Your Digital Butler In 2017, Twipe again was one of the winners of the innovation fund from Google DNI, with the selection of their joint project with The Times and The Sunday Times called 'JAMES - Your Digital Butler'. JAMES will use machine learning and AI to gradually get to know readers' habits, interests, and preferences. By exposing readers to relevant content in editions in their preferred formats, channels, times, and frequencies, JAMES will increase reader satisfaction and engagement and ultimately accelerate subscription growth. Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism called this project \\"a development to watch\\" in 2018. A March 2018 article in Digiday announced that a team of 9 people would be dedicated to the development of JAMES, combining a group from News UK's data science team along with Twipe's own development team. On May 23, 2019, The Times and The Sunday Times, along with their partner Twipe, introduced the key results of the JAMES project. The event took place at the News UK Building in London. As Charlotte Tobbit of Press Gazette explains, JAMES creates individualised emails by predicting content that subscribers are likely to be interested in, then sending it in their preferred format at the time they are most likely to read it. 117,000 subscribers of The Times and Sunday Times were part of the various experiments and 70 per cent of them interacted with James by either opening or clicking on the newsletter. The number of subscription cancellations, or churn, fell by 49 per cent among these subscribers compared with a control group which was not exposed to the James AI. This was particularly efficient with low- or medium- engagement subscribers. As Danny Lein, CEO of Twipe interviewed by Journalism.co.uk, added: ‚Äúthe key interest of JAMES is habit-building in readers, with AI providing a trigger for the audience to pick up the digital paper\\".  International presence  In 2013, Twipe signed their first French customer, Ouest-France and created the first purely digital French newspaper, L‚Äô√©dition du Soir. In 2015, Twipe strengthened its leadership position in the French market with the launch of Le T√©l√©gramme's apps. Le Parisien relaunched their apps in 2016 with Twipe's replica publishing solution. 2017 saw the launch of a new breed of app from Twipe, with Centre France‚Äôs app using the new Web App Touch technology. Twipe has also been active in the Dutch market, starting in 2014 with Holland Media Combinatie, one of the largest publishers of regional newspapers in the Netherlands. In 2017, Twipe signed their first big partnership in Germany with the launch of new ePaper apps for DuMont's seven regional newspapers. In 2017, it was announced that Agfa Graphics was migrating its mobile publishing activities to Twipe. With this migration of Agfa Graphics clients to the Twipe platform, Twipe strengthened its position in the German, Swiss, and Austrian newspaper and magazine markets. The migration doubled Twipe's customer base in German-language markets.

Based on the short story \\"Barn Burning\\" from The Elephant Vanishes by author Haruki Murakami, it stars Yoo Ah-in, Steven Yeun, and Jeon Jong-seo. The movie depicts a young deliveryman, Jong-su (Yoo), who runs into his childhood friend, Hae-mi (Jeon). She asks if he would look after her cat while she is away on a trip to Africa. On her return, she introduces to Jong-su an enigmatic young man named Ben (Yeun), who she met during her trip. One day, Ben tells Jong-su about an unusual hobby of his. The first film directed by Lee in eight years, the film premiered on May 16, 2018, at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it competed for the Palme d'Or; it ended up receiving the FIPRESCI International Critics' Prize at the festival. It was released the following day in South Korea and on October 26, 2018, in the United States. It received almost universal critical acclaim, particularly for its sense of unease, ambiguous narrative, and performances. It was selected as the South Korean entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards; although it was not nominated, it became the first Korean film to make it to the final nine-film shortlist; another South Korean film, Parasite (2019), won that award at the following year's ceremony. It received numerous other accolades, and was included on several critics' \\"top ten\\" lists for the year 2018, notably those of The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and the Associated Press; it was also included on some lists of the greatest films of the decade.  Plot  An aspiring young novelist, Lee Jong-su performs odd jobs in Paju. One day he runs into Shin Hae-mi, a childhood neighbor and classmate, at a promotion at which he is making a delivery. Jong-su initially does not remember her, but Shin Hae-mi tells him she had plastic surgery. Jong-su then remembers and gives her a pink watch that he won at the promotion. Later, she tells him about her upcoming trip to Africa, and asks him to feed her cat, Boil, while she is away. Before Hae-mi's departure, Jong-su's father, a cattle farmer, got tangled in disagreeable legal affairs, and Jong-su had to return to the farm. Jong-su passes by Hae-mi's apartment, where he receives instructions about feeding the cat. Later, they have sex in Hae-mi's apartment. After Hae-mi departs, Jong-su dutifully feeds her cat, although he never sees it. He does, however, know that a cat is there because he finds feces in the cat's litter box. He also begins habitually masturbating in her apartment. One day Hae-mi calls, saying she had become stranded at Nairobi Airport for three days after a bombing nearby. When Jong-su comes to pick her up, she arrives with Ben, whom she met and bonded with during the crisis. The three go out for dinner, where Hae-mi recalls a sunset she witnessed during her travels. Moved by the memory, she cries and confesses that she wanted to disappear. Ben is well-off and confident, though it is never entirely clear what he does for a living. Jong- su, struggling to get by and taking care of his family farm while his father is in prison, envies Ben and his relationship with Hae-mi from afar. Hanging out at Jong-su's farm, the trio smoke cannabis and Hae-mi dances topless. After Hae-mi has fallen asleep on the sofa, Ben confesses a strange hobby: Every two months, he burns an abandoned greenhouse. He notes that Jong-su's rural neighborhood is full of greenhouses. When asked when his next burning will take place, Ben claims it will be very soon and close to Jong-su's house. Jong-su tells Ben that he loves Hae-mi, but later berates Hae-mi for disrobing in front of other men. Hae-mi quietly gets into Ben's car and as they leave, Jong-su tells Ben he will keep an eye on the greenhouses in his area. Over the following days, Jong-su keeps watch around the neighborhood to see if any greenhouses burn down, but none do. One afternoon, in front of an intact greenhouse that he happens to be inspecting, he receives a call from Hae-mi, which cuts off after a few seconds of ambiguous noises. Jong-su becomes worried as she does not answer any of his calls afterwards, and begins to investigate after her phone number becomes disconnected. Eventually, he convinces the landlady to let him into Hae-mi's apartment so that he can feed her cat. Hae-mi's apartment is unnaturally clean; her pink suitcase remains; and all signs of the cat are gone. Jong-su begins stalking Ben, staking out his apartment and following him to see where he goes. When he sees Ben's Porsche parked outside a restaurant, he goes inside to confront him. A young woman suddenly approaches the table, apologizing to Ben for being late. As the three of them leave the restaurant, Jong-su asks Ben if he has heard from Hae- mi and whether she had gone on a trip. Ben says he has not heard from her, and he doubts she had gone on a trip because she could not afford it. Ben says Jong-su was the only person she trusted and that it made him jealous for the first time in his life. One day, Ben finds Jong-su outside his place and invites him up to his apartment, where he finds that he has a new cat, which Ben claims is a rescued stray. Jong-su's suspicions are raised further when on a visit to the toilet he finds a pink watch, similar to the one he had given Hae-mi, hidden in a drawer containing other pieces of women‚Äôs jewelry. Shortly afterwards, Ben's cat runs out of the apartment and Jong-su finds that it answers to \\"Boil\\", the same name as Hae-mi's cat. Jong-su asks to meet Ben in the countryside, claiming he is with Hae-mi. After Ben sees that Hae-mi is not there, Jong-su stabs Ben several times, killing him. Jong-su douses Ben's car and body in gasoline and sets it all aflame, tossing his blood-soaked clothes in as well. He stumbles naked to his truck and drives off.  Cast   Production  Developed as the work of the international project which was based on one of Haruki Murakami's short stories in The Elephant Vanishes, \\"Barn Burning\\". Production was set to begin in November 2016 but was delayed by a dispute between Murakami and NHK, which owns the rights to many of Murakami's works. It also merges elements of William Faulkner's 1939 short story of the same name. In October 2016, however, Lee said, \\"it is a story about young people in today‚Äôs world. When they think of their lives and the world, it must feel like a mystery\\", at the Busan International Film Festival. In September 2017, the studio said that it had only brought the basic outlines of the story. In 2016, it was thought that Gang Dong-won and Yoo Ah-in would feature in the film, but an official announcement was not made. On September 5, 2017, it was announced that Yoo Ah-in had been confirmed for the role of Jong-su. Three days later, newcomer Jeon Jong-seo was cast for the role of Hae-mi based on auditions which began in August. On September 20, Steven Yeun joined the film as Ben. Principal photography began on September 11, 2017. Filming was completed on January 30, 2018, in Paju.  Release  Cast and director at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.

Critical response  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 95% from 185 reviews, with an average rating of 8.59/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Burning patiently lures audiences into a slow-burning character study that ultimately rewards the viewer's patience -- and subverts many of their expectations.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 90 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Los Angeles Timess Justin Chang called it \\"a masterpiece of psychological unease‚Äî the most lucid and absorbing new movie I've seen this year, as well as the most layered and enigmatic.\\" The Guardians Peter Bradshaw called it \\"a gripping nightmare\\" and lavished praise on how \\"Lee creates a sense of mood and place with masterly flair.\\" Sight & Sound rated it the third best film of 2018, and Jessica Kiang wrote in her Cannes review, \\"The embers are banked up so gradually that it‚Äôs not until a few hours after the ending of this elusive, riveting masterpiece that you are far enough away to appreciate the scale of the conflagration.\\" Tim Robey in The Daily Telegraph observed, \\"This is Lee‚Äôs closest ever film to a thriller, but it defies expectations, offering multiple, murky solutions to a set of mysteries at once.\\" Vultures Emily Yoshida praised the film for its \\"perception of the rich vampirizing youth ‚Äî not directly biologically or physically or financially, but emotionally\\" but considered that \\"Burning lost its steam in its second half\\". Peter Debruge of Variety suggested that \\"[t]he degree to which Burning succeeds will depend largely on one's capacity to identify with the unspoken but strongly conveyed sense of jealousy and frustration its lower-class protagonist feels\\". Rolling Stones Peter Travers wrote that the film \\"sizzles with a cumulative power that will knock the wind out of you\\" and declared that \\"Lee has crafted a hypnotic and haunting film that transcends genre to dig deep into the human condition. You won‚Äôt be able to get it out of your head.\\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out was similarly positive, hailing it as a \\"movie rich in teasing ambiguities and possible lies... Lee's interest lies not in crime- solving but in exploring Jongsu's emotional confusion... Both a slow-burn suspense drama and an intriguing enigma, his film is beautifully executed\\". Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter reacted enthusiastically to the film, writing that \\"[t]his is a beautifully crafted film loaded with glancing insights and observations into an understated triangular relationship, one rife with subtle perceptions about class privilege, reverberating family legacies, creative confidence, self-invention, sexual jealousy, justice and revenge\\". For The Canadian Press, David Friend said the film includes \\"simmering layers of subtext and tension build over the film's two-and-a-half hour runtime.\\" Nick Pinkerton, writing in ArtForum, was more muted, writing that \\"Burning is strewn with all sorts of information whose exact meaning and validity is impossible to determine... a film with such a diffident, often passive protagonist must generate its tensions and attractions elsewhere‚Äîmemorable supporting players, a tactile atmosphere, a complex sense of the social sphere, an emphatic emotionalism\\". The depiction of the female character Hae-mi in the film attracted some criticism. However, Adam Nayman from Film Society of Lincoln Center argued and emphasized for The Ringer that the story is \\"told fully from Jongsu's point of view,\\" so \\"it's fair to ask whether Lee Chang Dong is cultivating true audience solidarity or urging us to understand the story exclusively through the lens of his hero's prejudices: to see Haemi and Ben as idealized and demonized figures, respectively.\\" Phoebe Chen of the Film Feminist Journal: Another Gaze, analyzed that Haemi's existence had a grander purpose in the film, and wrote, \\"If you know Burning is adapted from a Haruki Murakami short story, however loosely, you know that Haemi will vanish. The trope of the missing woman is built into Murakami's narrative DNA: her vanishing will preoccupy the protagonist, neurotically at first, then fade over the months and years to a dull malaise\\", and \\"The mystery of Haemi‚Äôs disappearance is technically 'solved', but becomes supplanted by one grander: the mystery of a world that tantalises with the hope of futurity while locking its millions of subjects in a cold impasse.\\" Alexandra Heller-Nicholas of Alliance of Women Film Journalists emphasized that the character of Hae-mi is much more than simply a missing woman as plot device but one of the most powerful parts of a film that casually yet firmly addresses the pressures on women, \\"While the film‚Äôs well-executed action and unflinching, profound exploration of its deeper thematic questions circle Jong-su and Ben with increasing intensity, it is this question of Hae-mi that drives the story. This is much, much more than simply a missing woman as plot device: one of the most powerful parts of a film that can comfortably boast a range of achievements is how casually yet firmly the film addresses the pressures on women ‚Äì not just Hae-mi and her colleagues, but Jong-su's own mother ‚Äì to live up to financially unsustainable images of femininity in contemporary South Korea.\\" Accolades Burning won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival.

He was an early example of a science popularizer, giving tours and experimental demonstrations across England and Ireland. He travelled and resided in Calcutta, India and travelled to China along with Lord Macartney as part of the Macartney Embassy to lecture on physics and promote British astronomical techniques.  Life and work  Dinwiddie was born on 8 December 1746 in Tinwald near Dumfries where his parents John Dinwoody and Catharine Riddick were farmers. One of five children, he was born shortly after the death of his father. He worked on the farm and gained an interest in mechanical devices, building a wooden clock even as a young boy. He went to school at the Dumfries academy where he studied mathematics and languages and continued his studies at the University of Edinburgh. The family hoped he would join the church but he took an interest in science. After his studies he spent some time as a teacher of mathematics and natural philosophy (physics mostly). Around this period he took a special interest in surveying and navigation. In February 1778 he received a Master of Arts from the University of Edinburgh and he was invited to teach at Ayr by Professor Dugald Stewart. In his lectures he demonstrated experiments, instruments and emphasised the use of mathematical principles involved in physical laws and gave examples to support his view: Dinwiddie however fared badly economically and earned little. For some time he taught geography. When Charles Spalding, the inventor of a diving bell and fellow experimenter, was killed in 1783 in an underwater operation, Dinwiddie attempted to examine the cause of the accident. When Jean-Pierre Blanchard and others began to make ballooning popular in Europe, Dinwiddie also attempted to make one. He used a technique to make silk airtight and ballooned from Bristol to Waterford while forgetting to pay his rent back in Dublin and nearly losing all his equipment which were to be sold off by the owner. He received an honorary Doctor of Law degree in 1792 from the University of Edinburgh and he was invited to join the embassy of Lord Macartney to China in 1792-93 where he was to demonstrate science and especially astronomy, a diving bell and a balloon for the Chinese emperor. He was initially designated as \\"Machinist to the Embassy\\" and later as \\"Astronomer\\". The astronomical instruments however failed to impress the Chinese unlike a German made planetarium device known as the Weltmaschine designed by Philipp Matth√§us Hahn. On return from China he met Sir John Shore, the governor of Calcutta. Dinwiddie stayed on in Calcutta and continued his researches. In 1795 he gathered subscriptions to lecture to nearly 180 ladies and gentlemen in Calcutta and raised rupees 100 for it. Some of the surveying instruments carried by Dinwiddie to China such as the chain were then sold in Calcutta and used by William Lambton in his initial surveys in southern India. In August 1795 Dinwiddie was appointed to assist the Board of Trade on matters of science for a pay of 500 rupees a month for a year but this was not extended. He also constructed a voltaic pile with which he claimed to have \\"treated\\" patients with palsy and rheumatism with electric shocks. Meanwhile, Dinwiddie was appointed as professor of natural philosophy at the Fort William College in 1801. He also conducted public as well as private lectures and demonstrations for Europeans and some of the Indian elite. He trained the Indian students Hurry Mohun Thakoor and Gopee Mohun Deb in astronomy in 1795. His students included the surveyor James Rennell. Dinwiddie advised the East India Company, prepared the chemists kit carried by Francis Buchanan for his survey of Mysore and manufactured nitrous acid for use in the hospital at Calcutta. Dinwiddie was also in correspondence with Joseph Hume who was his agent and supplier of chemicals in London. In 1796 he visited Madras where he met the Governor, Lord Hobart. He was elected to the Asiatic Society of Bengal. Dinwiddie left India in September 1806 and returned to England. He settled in London where he put together a collection of curiosities from India, China and Java. His hearing and health declined but he continued to pursue his researches, attending the lectures of others. In July 1810 he was elected to the Royal Institution and was made a member of the Committee of Mathematics, Mechanics, and Mechanical inventions. Dinwiddie was never married but he acknowledged a daughter Ann, named after her mother Ann Muir.

Early life Craufurd was the son of Patrick Craufurd of Auchenames, Renfrew, and Crosbie and Drumsoy, Ayr and his wife Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of George Middleton of Errol, Perth and Kinross. He was educated at Eton College from 1753 to 1757 where he was nicknamed 'The Fish' for his avid curiosity. There, he was a schoolfellow of Stephen Fox. He entered Glasgow University in 1757 and undertook a Grand Tour with Fox from 1760 to 1761. Through Fox he became an intimate of the Holland House circle. After his tour he made annual visits abroad and was as well known in French as in English society. He was a small man with a weak physique but exceptionally intelligent. His temperament was mercurial swinging between poles of gaiety, wit and restless activity on one hand and melancholy, hypochondria and indolence on the other. He was a notorious gambler and in 1764 was one of the early members of Almack's. He hoped to succeed his uncle Col. John Craufurd as MP for Berwick but was disappointed. He spent most of 1765 with Horace Walpole and David Hume in Paris, and formed an attachment to Madame du Deffand, whose devotion to her 'petit Craufurd' lasted many years. Early in 1766 he went home deep in debt. He managed to pacify his angry father by 'prudence, management and submission', and persuaded him to make over to him the revenues of the Errol estate. Considering Scotland as 'a vile country' where 'neither love nor wit can flourish', he became bored in the company of his father and returned to fashionable London life. He was cultivating Grafton's favour on behalf of his father and himself at the next election. Political career Craufurd hoped for a seat at Stockbridge but it fell through. He went to Bath obsessed by his health and later went to Paris with Lord March and G. A. Selwyn, in a bored and despondent mood. He kept in touch with political changes, and maintained contact with Shelburne and with Grafton, who, shortly after Craufurd's return home in December, offered him the place of Chamberlain of Fife and Strathearn which he held from 1767 to his death. He also obtained from Thomas Pitt the promise of a seat at Old Sarum and in addition proposed to contest Renfrew in place of his father. In the 1768 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Old Sarum Shortly after his election Craufurd had a dispute with Grafton and considered 'throwing up' his place, but was dissuaded by Hume. He gave up speaking in Parliament after his speech in support of a Government bill concerning the East India Company on 18 December 1768. He said \\"It was a prepared speech, ill-timed, ill-received, ill-delivered, languid, plaintive, and everything as bad as possible. Add to this, that it was very long, because being prepared and pompously begun, I did not know how the devil to get out of it ... The only thing I said which was sensible or to the purpose, was misrepresented by Edmund Burke. Certainly it was not the intention of nature that I should be a public speaker and I shall never attempt it any more\\". During the recess in 1771 he remained at home for once, where he persuaded his father to give him full possession of Errol. Mme du Deffand commented: \\"Il n‚Äôen est pas plus riche mais son credit en augmente et il aura la satisfaction de se pouvoir ruiner.\\" In the House his attendance was erratic. He later became concerned about his father's determination to curb expenditure and entail all the family estates. He consulted William Mure on this and on his election prospects, particularly as Sir Lawrence Dundas had offered to bring him in elsewhere if he failed in Renfrewshire. He showed considerable skill in election intrigue in Renfrewshire, Ayrshire, and Perthshire, in the 1774 British general election and was returned as MP for Renfrewshire. In 1775 Craufurd induced Lord North to give him life tenure of his post as Chamberlain of Fife, hitherto held at pleasure. Shortly afterwards his absurd behaviour became as notorious as his gambling. He plagued his friends with his imaginary ailments, his 'ennui and jealousies', with requests to pay his debts 'pour le delivrer des Juifs', 'gate-crashed' parties, but seldom attended when invited. Selwyn wrote in December 1775 'I think verily he grows more tiresome every day, and everybody's patience is √† bout.' At the 1780 general election, he was faced by a combination against him at Renfrewshire and withdrew. With the support of the Hamilton and Argyll interest he transferred to Glasgow Burghs where he was returned. In the new Parliament he continued to keep a foot in each camp. Having sold his estates of Errol and Drumsoy, he was now well funded and renewed his solicitations on behalf of his brother James Craufurd. In May he was toadying to Lord North, but in July, when he had received nothing, he \\"took occasion to say everything disagreeable to Lord North that one could well imagine\\". Selwyn wrote in October 1781 \\"That abominable cortigiano-ism with his affected disinterestedness and noblesse d'√¢me make him intolerable.\\" When he was in a quandary Craufurd usually made illness his excuse. Before the motion of censure against the Admiralty, Selwyn wrote \\"I hope that Government will send two yeomen of the guard to carry the Fish down in his blankets, for he pretends to have the gout ... He should be deposited ... and be fairly asked his opinion and forced to give it one way or the other en pleine assembl√©e.\\" In 1784 in the expectation of a dissolution, Craufurd was planning to stand for Ayrshire as well as for Renfrewshire and Glasgow, and to put his brother in for the former and some friend in for the latter. When no immediate dissolution took place, he fell 'ill' and went to Bath. In the event, at the 1784 general election he did not attempt Renfrewshire, he had little chance in Ayrshire and he lost his seat at Glasgow Burghs. Craufurd did not contest an Ayrshire by-election of 1789. Coutts commented \\"I do not imagine he thinks of Ayr or Renfrew any more. Politics is by no means his natural bent; yet had he taken a public line early, few have better abilities.\\" Glasgow Burghs fell vacant in 1790 and Craufurd won back his old seat in a by-election on 26 February 1790. After a few months, he lost it again at the 1790 general election and his bid for Dysart Burghs also failed. Later life Soon after losing his seat, Craufurd fell seriously ill. In 1792 he went to Paris but was horrified by revolutionary excesses and returned home. Thereafter he did not try to re-enter Parliament and abandoned his Foxite friends. He died on 26 May 1814.

It falls under the municipality of Oeiras in Lisbon District. History Attacks by French and Turkish pirates, especially in 1552 and 1556, demonstrated the need for Portugal to strengthen the defence of Lisbon. This led to the decision to fortify the island of S. Juli√£o da Barra in the River Tagus estuary in 1556. The fort of S√£o Louren√ßo do Bugio followed in 1590. As early as 1693, the fort is believed to have already possessed a light to aid navigation. An inspection of the lighthouse in 1751 reported that the fire was fuelled with olive oil and operated from October to March. This original lighthouse was destroyed during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake but in 1758, Sebasti√£o Jos√© de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal ordered the construction of six new lighthouses, including a new one at Bugio. In 1775, the new lighthouse came into operation, illuminated by an Argand lamp with parabolic reflectors. In 1829 a new rotating mechanism driving 16 lamps was installed and in 1896, a 3rd order optics device with a new oil supply was installed. The Bugio Lighthouse with its characteristic green light. To the left can be made out the red light of the S√£o Juli√£o lighthouse. Together, these lights mark the entrance to the port of Lisbon. During the First World War, the light did not function. In 1923, a new, larger 3rd order optical device was installed. In 1933, after it was decided to replace all fixed lights in Portugal, the lighthouse was changed to a flashing bright green one, a feature that it still has today. In 1946, the fuel was switched to petroleum and the light was electrified with the use of a 500 W / 110 V lamp in 1959, using generators for power. A foghorn was introduced in 1961. In 1981, the light was automated, permitting it to be remotely controlled, and became unmanned the following year. A fog detector was also installed. In 1994, an ML 300 omnidirectional Fresnel lens operating with solar energy replaced the old equipment and a new foghorn was also installed. Since the fort is located on an island that is very exposed to the action of the sea, it has been necessary to carry out maintenance and consolidation on numerous occasions. There are works documented in 1788, 1804, 1807, 1818, 1952, and 1981. In the winter of 1993, the sea brought down a significant part of the lower platform of the fort, and the situation became more acute in the following years, requiring urgent repair. This was carried out between 1997 and 2001, by which time the tower had been in danger of collapse. In July, 2008, the ML 300 flashlight was removed and replaced with a Vega VLB44 Beacon, together with 4 solar panels, increasing the luminous range to 15 miles. The lighthouse emits a green flash of one second every 5 seconds. It marks the entrance to the port of Lisbon, along with the S√£o Juli√£o lighthouse.

Siege money or money of necessity is a form of Notgeld (emergency money) that was issued in times of war or invasion, such as during a siege. In the early modern period, it was necessary in Europe because at that time coinage had an intrinsic value and even though a town was besieged commerce had to continue and soldiers had to be paid. There are examples from the Eighty Years War (1568‚Äì1648) and the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651). There is also related coinage issued by some field commanders such as Duke of Ormonde in Ireland who did not have ready access to official coinage minted by the civil authorities (see Civil War mints). The issuing of money during sieges is not restricted to that period; for example during the Siege of Khartoum (1884‚Äì1885) currency in the form of paper money was issued by Governor-General of the Sudan, British Major-General Charles George Gordon. Eighty Years War During the Eighty Years War a number of towns and cities issued their own currency (money of necessity), for example during the siege of Leyden (1574), the authorities issued diamond (square) silver coinage struck with a circular die. When silver ran out they used the same die to print money on cardboard. This was the first usage of paper money in Europe. English Civil War During the First English Civil War a number of garrisons issued their own siege money they included Carlisle (1645), Scarborough (1645) and Newark-on-Trent (1646). Of these the siege money of Newark was the most plentiful and compared to other similar coins minted at the same time more has survived. Around 2011 a rarer Scarborough siege sixpence sold for ¬£42,000, while in 2012 a Newark shilling sold for 1,900 USD.

Adapted from the novel l'Affaire Saint-Fiacre by the Belgian writer Georges Simenon, it tells how Maigret goes privately to the aid of his late father's employer who has received an anonymous death threat and, though unable to prevent the death, unmasks the plotters. Plot Commissioner Maigret returns to Saint-Fiacre, the village he grew up in, where his father had been estate manager for the family owning the ch√¢teau. The widowed countess has asked him to come urgently because she has received an anonymous letter saying she will die next day, which is Ash Wednesday. He finds the ch√¢teau in a sorry state: its contents are being systematically sold by the countess' young assistant Sabatier and its lands by the current estate manager Gautier and his young son √âmile, a bank clerk. They say they are doing this to fund the countess' son Maurice, an alcoholic playboy who rarely visits his now-sick mother. Early next morning the countess goes to mass at the village church where, on returning to her pew after receiving the sacrament, she falls dead. The local doctor Bouchardon is not surprised, telling Maigret that her heart was weak and that she died of natural causes. When that day's local paper arrives, the front page reports that the young count Maurice killed himself in Paris the day before. But Maurice is in fact alive and has rushed back on learning of his mother's death. Ringing the newspaper, Maigret is told that the report was phoned in last thing without time to check. Now convinced of a plot to rob and kill the countess, whose young favourite he had once been, Maigret starts his own investigation of what caused her sudden death and who wanted her dead. On returning to her pew she had opened her missal, which has disappeared. He finds it hidden in the sacristry and pasted in it is the newspaper report of her son's suicide. At the time of her death the day's newspapers had not reached the village shop, so somebody brought the cutting from the town where the paper was printed. Without revealing his hand, Maurice has also been investigating and, while his mother's body is still lying upstairs, organises a macabre dinner party for those he suspects. At it, Maigret accuses both the doctor and the assistant of negligence, but not homicide, and then reveals that the plotters were the manager and his son, who sought to cut out Maurice and enrich themselves. He calls the local police to take them away.

The Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest is an ongoing protest in Taiwan started on Ketagalan Boulevard in Taipei City by Taiwanese aborigines in February 2017 asking for more official recognition of land as traditional territories, in particular for the possibility of private land to also be designated as indigenous territory, which was not allowed for by the February 2017 regulations brought forward by the governmental Council of Indigenous Peoples. Some more prominent figures who have led the protests are activist Panay Kusui (Â∑¥Â•à¬∑Â∫´Á©ó), her husband Nabu Husungan Istanda (ÈÇ£Â∏É) and documentary filmmaker Mayaw Biho (È¶¨Ë∫ç¬∑ÊØîÂêº). One of the movements' slogans is \\"No one is an outsider\\" (). History On 14 February 2017 the Council of Indigenous Peoples held a press conference on the \\"Regulations for Demarcating Indigenous Traditional Territories\\" () and on 18 February 2017 the same governmental body officially proclaimed those regulations. Because the regulations excluded private land from what was designated as indigenous land in the draft proposal, only around eight hundred thousands hectares of land would be recognized as traditional territory, which was in sharp contrast with an earlier estimate by the same Council of Indigenous Peoples, based on a survey completed in 2007, in which it was said that around 1.8 million hectares of land should be designated as such. This was the reason for the start of the \\"Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest\\" on 23 February. The activists feared that the police would destroy their campout before the first anniversary of the inauguration of president Tsai Ing-wen on 20 May 2017. Because, on 3 June 2017, the protest site was destroyed by the police, the activists resettled the protest to the Taipei Metro National Taiwan University Hospital Station. Relation to other protests =Sunflower movement= Sunflower Student Movement leader Lin Fei-fan (ÊûóÈ£õÂ∏Ü) actively joined the first day of the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest and later, on 28 February 2017, on Peace Memorial Day () which commemorates the February 28 Incident, Lin Fei-fan again joined the protest, marching towards 228 Peace Memorial Park and afterwards published a later translated essay in which he claims \\"to stand with Taiwan‚Äôs indigenous peoples\\" on the issue. =Asia Cement's mining rights= In June and July 2017, thousands of people protested between the building of the Executive Yuan and the Presidential Office Building to raise concerns about the twenty-year extension of the mining rights of the corporation Asia Cement (part of the Far Eastern Group conglomerate) granted on 14 March 2017 without conducting an environmental impact assessment. The protestors being large in numbers was said to be following the death of Taiwanese documentary maker Chi Po-Lin earlier in June while filming a sequel to his 2013 film \\"Beyond Beauty: Taiwan From Above\\", as the release of Chi's final footage of the \\"Sincheng Mine\\" (referring to Asia Cement's mine in Hualien County's Xincheng Township) in which one could purportedly see the company having expanded it operations, while the latter claimed it had reduced them, went viral. Activist Panay Kusui (Â∑¥Â•à¬∑Â∫´Á©ó) joined these environmental protesters, on the common grounds of accusing the government of not protecting Aboriginal land from exploitation. The environmental activists of the protests against Asia Cement's extension of mining rights, on their turn, joined the relocated protest site of the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest. Nabu Husungan Istanda (ÈÇ£Â∏É) claimed that a friendship and cooperation thus arose between the indigenous and environmental protesters. Popular culture On 17 March 2017, the English singer and songwriter Joss Stone, as part of her \\"Total World Tour\\", went to learn a song from the protest leader Panay Kusui (Â∑¥Â•à¬∑Â∫´Á©ó) and sing it together with her where Panai had been camping out twenty-three days at the protest sit-in, then still located on Ketagalan Boulevard. In the video which resulted from this collaboration Stone briefly introduces the Indigenous Ketagalan Boulevard protest.

The brook is formed at the confluence of Bower Brook and Hole Bottom Brook. This occurs near the Rochdale Canal in Failsworth in the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham. It flows southwest, forming the border between Moston, Manchester and Failsworth before being culverted almost all of the remaining route to its meeting the River Irk. It has a total length of about 3.7 miles (6 kilometres). The river was used industrially during the Cottonopolis period of Manchester's history, such as for the washing, bleaching and dyeing of yarns, although Moston was mostly noted for silk weaving. Clay and sand pits, which once fed brickworks, were later used for landfill sites. These landfills were later expanded by culverting the brook, though the last one closed in the 1990s. The brook's heavy industrial use and urban location led to it becoming badly polluted. In the early 2000s, the brook was identified as one of the most polluted bodies of water in Greater Manchester, if not the whole of the North West of England. However, this was the beginning of an ongoing concerted effort to enhance the water quality of the brook. This included work to divert and renovate combined sewer overflows, and the installation of drainage channels to divert surface water from nearby industrial sites and leachate from historic landfills. Work continues to improve the environment around the brook. Reprofiling and landscaping in the 1980s and environmental improvements in the 21st century mean that the brook is now seen as a community asset and an area of biodiversity. The remaining parts of the brook that avoided being culverted are used for recreation by the local community. Course A map showing most of the non-culverted parts of Moston Brook The brook flows approximately 3.7 miles (6.0 km) from its source (the confluence of Bower Brook and Hole Bottom Brook) to its confluence with the River Irk. It forms part of the River Irwell drainage basin. The source of Moston Brook is now hidden. Its most upstream part is fully obscured in two culverts, the South Culvert and the North Culvert. The South Culvert is what remains of one of the brook's upstream tributaries, Bower Brook, which flows from the Werneth area and past a pumping station in South Chadderton. Another tributary, Hole Bottom Brook, rises in north Hollinwood and runs to the Failsworth boundary near the Rochdale Canal, where a short section is still in daylight. The North Culvert was connected in the 1990s in order to take run- off from a newly constructed part of the M60 motorway. The confluence of Bower Brook and Hole Bottom Brook is considered the start of Moston Brook proper. The brook then flows southwest, forming the boundary between the City of Manchester and the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, both parts of Greater Manchester. It is partly culverted at Broadway Common due to landfilling activities. The brook flows into Manchester at the southern boundary between Moston and Newton Heath, where it passes into another culvert which takes it underneath Moston Vale. Here it is joined by the Dean Brook, which flows past the site of Moston Hall in Broadhurst Park and is also culverted south of Joyce Street. Up to the early nineteenth century, the section between Failsworth and the Dean Brook was known as Morris Brook. The brook is briefly visible again in Collyhurst near Manchester Communication Academy, before again entering culverts which take it most of the way to its confluence with the River Irk. The main part of the brook that is currently above ground is broken down into the following areas: * Wrigley Head ‚Äì part of the brook near the Rochdale Canal. * Hardman Fold ‚Äì once a farm, brickworks and clay-pit, and later a landfill, the area is now meadows, woodland and a waterside walk. Public footpath 79 also runs on the northern (Manchester) side of the valley. * Broadway ‚Äì incorporating Lower Failsworth Memorial Land which, after World War I, was purchased by public subscription for the people of Failsworth. * Moston Fairway ‚Äì a rare urban nature reserve, run by the Lancashire Wildlife Trust. Part of it was, until 1981, the site of Moston Exchange railway sidings on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Although it does not directly connect with the brook valley, it is close by and is considered part of the same amenity area. History There were once \\"white hills\\" beside the brook near Wrigley Head, here shown in 1970. The area was largely rural but had been engaged in the washing, bleaching and dyeing of yarns since the 16th century, although Moston itself was mostly noted for silk weaving. By 1848, Moston Mill Print Works had already sprung up next to the brook to make use of the running water, joined later by Spring Valley Dye Works in Failsworth. A mill pond, a mill race and a weir were constructed to feed the former, of which only the weir remains. Monsall Hospital was constructed on the banks of the brook in 1871. In 1878, North Road football stadium and cricket ground was built nearby for the use of Newton Heath LYR works team, the team that would later become Manchester United F.C. There were \\"white hills\\" along the banks of the brook, formed from industrial waste. The origin of the hills is unclear, though the hills are shown in photographs dated 1913. Excavation of clay and sand pits alongside the brook fed brickworks on Hale Lane, Failsworth. From around 1949, these pits were used as landfills, the last of which (Hardman Fold) was closed in the 1990s. The brook was gradually culverted along much of its length, in some cases to make room for more landfill sites. For example, the part of the brook that was near Monsall Hospital was culverted to make way for a landfill in the mid-1970s. The hospital itself closed down in 1993 and was demolished soon after. Moston Brook High School, which was built on the former site of the North Road sports pitches, was closed in August 2000. The remaining visible part of the brook between Failsworth and Moston was reprofiled and landscaped in the 1980s. Valley slopes were smoothed, paths and steps were incorporated, drainage channels were installed and stabilisation work was conducted. Environment Pollution The proliferation of factories and works in north Manchester, Failsworth and Oldham during and after the Industrial Revolution led to Moston Brook becoming badly polluted. Local children referred to it as the \\"Black Brook\\", though the brook changed colour depending on the dyes or pigments being discharged into the brook and its tributaries. At the time, children were known to have drowned in the brook while playing there. Other pollutants over the years included oil gas tar from Hollinwood Gas Works and waste from Failsworth tannery. Both the Rochdale and Hollinwood Canals discharged overflows into the streams, so pollution from the canal water would also find its way into the system. The inflow to one of Moston Brook's culverts From 1990 to 2007, the brook consistently received the lowest possible grade from the Environment Agency, meaning it was very polluted and had a severely restricted ecosystem. Of all the bodies of water in the Water Framework Directive, it was considered one of the most challenging to improve. It was thus one of the most polluted bodies of water in Greater Manchester, possibly even in the whole North West of England. As part of the Water Framework Directive, it was given the Ecological Quality of Moderate Potential and the possibility of achieving good status by 2027. The brook was failing with regard to levels of ammonia, phosphate and dissolved oxygen. Improvements These poor results led to the Environment Agency and United Utilities agreeing to work together to improve the brook's water quality. This included screening of combined sewer overflows (CSOs). An assessment in 2013 found that the likely causes of pollution in the brook included: intermittent discharge from sewers during storm overflows; leachate from old landfill sites; and continuous sewage discharges from domestic properties due to wrong connections. Other factors investigated were leakage from St Josephs's Cemetery and runoff from the M60 motorway. The study found that fish are absent from the brook. United Utilities has spent ¬£2 million improving sewerage infrastructure near the brook and the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority (GMWDA) has spent ¬£400,000 on a methane-stripping plant for one of its former landfills. The Environment Agency has funded sustainable drainage systems to prevent surface water entering the brook from a nearby industrial site and former landfill areas. Both Oldham and Manchester Councils recognise the brook's potential as an area of biodiversity. In 2010, Oldham Council hired a member of staff as project officer, in charge of improving the quality of the Moston Brook corridor. Manchester Council has investigated fly tipping incidents. Song thrushes have been found around Moston Brook (illustrative) There is a local friends group called Moston Brook Friends Group. The group meets to plan access improvements, events, volunteering sessions, guided walks and nature activities. Wildlife A habitat survey of the Moston Brook corridor was conducted by The Greater Manchester Ecology Unit in 2007. Important habitats identified include lowland broad leaved woodland, marshy grassland, reed bed and lowland heath/acid grassland, all of which are priority habitats for conservation listed in the national and Greater Manchester Biodiversity Action Plans. Important species identified included song thrush, house sparrow, starling, snipe and kestrel. The Moston Brook corridor is bookended by two important sites designated for their nature conservation area. The first of the Rochdale Canal Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) which is a European Designated Site of international conservation importance. The second is the Moston Fairway Nature Reserve (former railway sidings at Moston), a Site of Biological Importance (SBI) which is a designated site of sub-regional nature conservation importance. Recreation On the border between Moston and Failsworth, Moston Brook is a recreational resource for residents of both communities. The project officer for the site is tasked with coordinating activities and encouraging the local communities to make use of the corridor. For example, an annual Fun Day is held on Lower Failsworth Memorial Land, with activities such as falconry displays, bouncy castles, arts and crafts and model train rides. Lancashire Wildlife Trust has organised volunteering sessions around Moston Brook and the project officer has conducted bat spotting tours with the local community. Entrances to the brook have been built along its route by Oldham and Manchester Councils. These allow access to paths and cycleways which can be used for walks, rides and educational activities.

It has been described as an homage to the 1962 Agn√®s Varda film Cl√©o from 5 to 7. The film was shot in 16 days in New York City, and follows Vivienne (Parker), a singer who is diagnosed with a glioblastoma. It had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2018. It was released in the United States on November 9, 2018, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Movie starts with the zooming in of Vivienne‚Äôs (Sarah Jessica Parker) trembling blue crystal eyes. Whilst in the waiting room, Vivienne who is visibly anxious receives a call from her manager, Ben (Common), that she is late for the rehearsal. Afterwards, Vivienne finds out from her doctor, Dr. Marianne Holt (Mary Beth Peil), that she has a terminal brain tumor. Additionally, if she decides to undergo treatments, her average rate of survival is 14 months. However, the side effect from removal of her tumor includes impacts to her mobility, language skills and musical ability. Which in turns jeopardizes her livelihood since she is a singer. After the visit with Dr. Holt, Vivienne walks aimlessly around NYC. She receives multiple calls which she rejected/missed from her mother, Jeanne (Jacqueline Bisset). Vivienne finally reaches the rehearsal studio and is received by Ben at the front door. He informs her that she has an upcoming interview right after the rehearsal. As she comes face to face with her band mates, she apologizes for being late. She begins hugging everyone else except the drummer, Jordan (Taylor Kinney), whom she simply just said hello to. After the rehearsal, Jordan asks Vivienne out for coffee and is refused due to the interview. Their fingers linger on his drum set, implying that they have a romantic relationship. After, Vivienne climbs up to the second floor with Jordan ensue. They begin making out passionately with Ben later interrupting. They then proceed to have sex. Afterwards, Vivienne continues to wander around aimlessly as she makes her way to the interview location. She passes by a clothing store and buys an expensive dress to wear for her tour. She then attends the interview but doesn‚Äôt seem like she is into the conversation with the interviewer, Oona (Phillipa Soo). After the interview, Vivienne goes to Birdland and meets Ray (Michael Potts). Their conversation ends with Vivienne rushing off for her Lyft. Throughout her Lyft ride, Sami (Waleed Zuaiter), the Lyft driver is in a heated argument over the phone and blasted rock music after. Vivienne visibly uncomfortable in her Lyft ride, demanded to get off early. She returns home and is greeted by her mother who bombarded her with tons of questions and concerns. Vivienne becomes increasing annoyed and replies rudely to Jeanne. Jeanne apologizes to her and left the kitchen. After a glass of wine, Vivienne locks herself in her room, saw a young picture of her daughter, Lucie (Gus Birney), and started crying. She realizes what she has done to her mother and went out to apologize and hugs her. Subsequently, she recalls that she has left her dress in her Lyft and called Sami to retrieve it. Sami arrives outside Vivienne‚Äôs house to return her dress. As he is about to drive off, Vivienne halts him and asked if she can catch a ride to somewhere nearby. Sami rejects her request and drives off as he didn‚Äôt want anyone on board with him while he is attending to a personal phone call. Vivienne arrives at her ex, Nick‚Äôs (Simon Baker), house unannounced. Nick invites her to dinner and she politely declines. On one hand, Vivienne wants to talk to Nick about her condition before Lucie gets home. On the other hand, Nick wants to talk to Vivienne about attending Lucie‚Äôs recitals. Which means that Vivienne will have to cancel some of her tours to attend the recitals. Before Vivienne could proceed further, Lucie returns home. She appears to treat and respond to Vivienne‚Äôs advances coldly. Vivienne who is sensitive enough to know that her daughter is unhappy with her, decides to remove herself from Nick‚Äôs house. She bids Nick and Lucie farewell and left. Outside the door, she starts to sob. She continues wandering around aimlessly, ends up on a bridge and has a rather odd conversation with an older lady (Venida Evans). Vivienne then calls Ben to arrange a meet up at their usual spot. As she travels to their meeting spot, she chances upon her old friend, Tessa (Ren√©e Zellweger). They have a little catch up session about their lives before Tessa returns to her birthday party. Vivienne then attends a performance in which Jordan is playing the drums. After the performance, she is invited to sing on stage. Vivienne covers a song \\"Unfollow the Rules\\" by Rufus Wainwright. She later has sex with Jordan at his apartment and leaves him in the middle of the night. She gets into a Lyft and met Sami again, who drives her to Nick‚Äôs house. Nick is dismayed that Vivienne has once again shows up announced. Lucie who is already awake comes out of her bedroom to see what the common is about. Nick excuses himself to allow Vivienne some time with Lucie. In her bedroom, Lucie plays her song to her mother and is met with a huge adoration by Vivienne. Vivienne proceeds to hand the dress she bought earlier to Lucie and passes it off as a gift, which was originally intended for her tour. Before Lucie fell asleep, Vivienne expresses her regrets for not being there for her. Lucie acknowledges and comforts Vivienne by saying that she likes her so much more than her friends like their mothers right now. Vivienne kisses Lucie goodnight and leaves her bedroom and goes to the living room to see Nick watching an old French movie. They converse awhile before Nick realizes something is wrong with Vivienne. Vivienne discloses that something is indeed wrong with her. Nick reprimands her for prioritizing work over what is actually important and alludes that she is selfish. Before they conclude their conversation, Nick wants Vivienne to update him about her condition before they decide how to disclose her condition to Lucie. Nick then holds her hand and expresses that he really does care for her and that he is scared. Vivienne then pull her hand away from Nick and returns to Lucie‚Äôs bedroom. She sits down beside Lucie‚Äôs bed and spends the night shaking and weeping. In the morning, Vivienne sneaks out Nick house without informing neither Lucie nor Nick. She returns home to pack some clothes for her surgery and leaves the house without informing Jeanne. She takes a Lyft and is chauffeured by Sami once again. As Vivienne reveals her destination, Sami realizes that she is facing some health issues. While driving he turns around to check out Vivienne, but Vivienne avoids his eye contacts and takes a nap for the remainder of the Lyft ride. She is later awakened by him. Outside the hospital, due to Vivienne‚Äôs request, both Vivienne and Sami get out of the car for coffee. Vivienne politely declines Sami's invitation to stay. She begins walking away from Sami and finally turns around smiling at him. Sami returns her a comforting smile. After, Ben shows up walking out of the hospital to fetch Vivienne. He proceeds towards her as they embrace, he then carries her bag, and they entered the hospital. While on the hospital bed, Vivienne removes her jewelries. The scene cuts back to the movie opening but coupled with her heavy breathing and a loud nervous sigh.

Shortly after, Paramount Pictures acquired US distribution rights to the film and set the film for a November 9, 2018, release. Reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 23% based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 4.03/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on ten critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Peter Debruge of Variety found that \\"Constant can't decide whether Vivienne is keeping her emotions buried deep inside or wearing them on her sleeve, and because Parker plays it somewhere in between, we rely on other characters to elucidate the situation.\\" Rex Reed of The Observer similarly found the film \\"Bleak and paced with the energy of drops of water from a plumbing leak, Here and Now is deliberately slow, hoping to provide viewers a chance to share the torturous mental anguish Vivienne is going through. The process only succeeds in boring us to death. This is no fault of Parker, who also produced the film, but of Fabien Constant, an inexperienced film director best known for TV commercials, who is making his feature-film debut.\\" The film, widely considered an homage to Cl√©o from 5 to 7 (1962), was negatively compared to the original. David Erhlich of IndieWire felt that \\"for an homage boasting a far more fatal outlook than Varda's original, it's frustrating and kind of perverse that Blue Night [Here and Now] should be so gentle. 'I'm not done yet,' Vivienne declares. But we never even see her get started.\\" Erhlich also found that \\"a chance run-in with an estranged friend (Ren√©e Zellweger, in a very welcome cameo) leaves all sorts of meat on the table, minutes of screen time wasted on the vague understanding that growing older requires people to tighten their emotional bandwidth.\\" In a mixed review, Dana Schwartz of Entertainment Weekly found that \\"the premise‚Äîan homage to the 1962 Agn√®s Varda film Cl√©o From 5 to 7‚Äîworks in spurts\\" while praising the appearance of Zellweger, describing the film as \\"heightened by the magnetic Ren√©e Zellweger, barely concealing her suburban rage behind a cheerfully swirled glass of wine.\\" Overall she felt however, \\"for most of the film, Parker's Vivienne is bland and forgettable.\\" References External links 2018 films 2018 romantic drama films American films American romantic drama films English-language films Films about cancer Films about singers Films set in New York City Paramount Pictures films 2018 drama films ","title":"Here and Now (2018 film)"},{"id":"55383663","text":"A colliery viewer or coal viewer was the manager of a coal mine or colliery. The term was mostly used in the late eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, in the UK. In modern use, the viewer would be the senior and responsible mining engineer at a site.  Origins  The role began as a person to represent the owner of the land, often an aristocrat, who had leased the rights to mine there to another who would 'work' the mine. One of the first formally recorded arrangements for such was at the Ironbridge Gorge in 1608, where Jesse Whittingham leased four adits from James Clifford, at a rent of ¬£200 a year for five years. Clifford had acquired the lands of Wenlock Priory at Broseley in 1560, after the priory's dissolution in 1540. Several such monastic lands moved from traditional tenant farming to entrepreneurial mineral exploitation at this time, spurring the early industrial revolution, particularly around the Gorge. Land at this time was rarely sold, the aristocratic estates were intent on preserving themselves intact, and so mining rights would usually be in terms of a long-term lease. As both of these gentlemen were affluent, if not titled, they would not be familiar with mining themselves and would not generally wish to become so. As mines grew larger and more complex into the nineteenth century, the role of the viewer shifted to representing the safe technical management of the mine, on behalf of the owner. Later, as mine safety laws were passed, the viewer had a duty to represent the interests of the miners as well. The viewer was usually employed by the owner, but in some cases was also the owner, or part-owner, themselves. The New Hartley Pit, of the Hartley Colliery disaster, was owned by the Carr brothers, where one brother acted as viewer. An experienced viewer, known for their good judgement, was recognised as a skilled profession and in the North East they often became an independent contractor or consultant who would advise a number of mines on particular issues, such as sinking a new shaft, or making a new investment. This represented the shift from the viewer as manager or agent, to the development of the modern mining engineer. Even at the time, the distinction between managers, or 'agents', for the day-to-day operation of collieries, and consultant viewers, who advised on the development of new aspects, was never a clear one. The viewer would be responsible for deciding major expenditures, such as the purchase of a pumping engine or construction of a tramroad or railway. These new technical innovations were described in advisory guide books such as John Curr's The Coal Viewer and Engine Builder's Practical Companion (1797).  Other roles   Overman  The overman is a deputy to the viewer and involved more directly with the daily work of the pit. When a colliery has a number of pits under a viewer, there is an overman to each pit. The overman has responsibilities for daily and hands-on tasks, such as inspecting the pit's safety each day and recording the work performed for piece work systems. An overman would be an experienced miner who has been promoted on the basis of experience. A viewer in the early years, in contrast, would often be a 'gentleman' from a social class comparable to that of the bourgeois owner. In later years, from the mid-19th century, it became more common for viewers to be skilled miners who had risen through the ranks. Wages in 1849 for an overman were 26 shillings to 28s. per week. This was twice that of other skilled trades, such as blacksmiths, indicative of the responsibility. As for most jobs, down to the lowliest colliers, a house and free small coal were also provided. There was a distinction in a colliery between 'day wagemen', those such as overmen and engine drivers, who were paid a daily or weekly wage and 'oncostmen', those such as coal cutters and loaders, who were paid according to a 'bargain', a form of piecework. The overman would keep the records of work done underground, so that on the Wednesday before a Friday payday he could 'reckon' with the men and agree the totals of work done. The overman would also have regular roles underground, whereas the viewer would spend most of their time on the surface. = Back- overman = Pits in the 19th century worked a two shift system, with a morning or 'fore' shift (6am-2pm) and an afternoon or 'back' shift (2-10pm). Having an overman permanently on site was considered so important that a second deputy or 'back-overman' would work the second shift. Depending on pit conditions, the fore shift might concentrate on winning coal and the back shift on the 'dead work' of timbering and propping roadways etc.  Under- viewer  The viewer's role, particularly with the development of parliamentary mining regulations in the mid-nineteenth century, was ultimately that of responsibility. Although not necessarily owning the mine or being the engineer engaged to direct it technically, the viewer would be held responsible for any accident. The under-viewer, under-looker or steward, was a deputy to the viewer. As well as being an assistant to them, their main role was to act as a locum if the viewer is away from the colliery, and to ensure that the responsible person was always present.  Check-viewer  A viewer employed by the lessor to see that the provisions of the lease are duly observed. These provisions would include that the area being mined did not exceed the boundaries contracted for in the lease, that the amount of support left by stall and pillar working would be sufficient to avoid surface collapse, and sometimes also that surface waters were not polluted by run-off from mine drainage.

He has done more real work, and seen more seams of coal with his own eyes, than any other living follower of the art of mining engineering\\"\\"The duties of a colliery viewer, in which Mr. Forster was so largely engaged, were such as none but the most vigorous and laborious men could execute. Sometimes at midnight, or at the early hours of two or three o'clock, he was subject to be called upon to travel many miles, to descend deep pits, to traverse underground works, and, not unfrequently, to penetrate into parts of a mine where nothing but the most careful judgment could preserve him from extreme risk of explosion or other accident. The commander, as it were, of many thousands of miners, he not only directed their labours, but gained their friendly confidence. In the mine he was thoroughly at home. He affected only such habits and modes of speech as were perfectly understood by the pitman ; and to this peculiar tact his usefulness and success were in a great measure owing. In dealing with those of elevated rank, a respectful deference was never allowed to interfere with the most plain and freely spoken expression of opinion; and thus he maintained at all times a consistency of character, and a large amount of influence with all parties he met, or for whom he was concerned in professional business.\\"  References  Coal mining Industrial occupations ","title":"Colliery viewer"},{"id":"55383665","text":"Srƒëan Pirivatriƒá () is a Serbian historian and diplomat.

His paintings have been exhibited in the United Kingdom, including the Tate Modern in London, China, USA, Germany Australia Mexico Poland and Italy. Litten attended Amersham College of Art (now Amersham & Wycombe College) in his teens and later began higher art education but found it claustrophobic and restricting. He moved to Cornwall in 2001 and chose to begin exhibiting. Early success came in 2003 when his work was included in an exhibition titled ‚ÄòNudes‚Äô in New York City, (along with Jacob Epstein and Pierre-Auguste Renoir) with a review in the New York Times. In 2007 Litten had his first major London exhibition with \\"Dog Breeder\\" created as an anti-art statement on the absurdity of the contemporary art world and its hierarchies. Recent work (since 2014) deals with humanistic themes such as social alienation, love, sensuality, fear, anger, loss, ageing, addiction, paranoia and other identity disturbance. His dynamic and gestural figurative paintings express a strong interest in the universal complexity of everyday existence. Sudden Involuntary Chemical Withdrawal oiloncanvas 120 x 120cm 2016  Early life  Andrew Litten \\"Domestic Fight\\" 1994 At the age of sixteen Litten began taking evening classes in life drawing, with an early interest in expressionist art. He then attended art college as a teenager but found it \\"restricting and claustrophobic\\" so left college with the intention of finding inspiration within commonplace life. From 1990 to 1999, he created figurative representations of the ordinary and the everyday that often conveyed emotive poignancy. Litten's paintings and assemblages at this time often referenced song titles, including 'Stepping Out' by The Fall, 'You Always Hurt The One You Love' by The Mills Brothers and 'Kitchen Person' by The Associates. His use of wit is a striking factor in his work at this time and is manifest in his choice of materials and their appropriateness to his subjects. Joseph Clarke wrote \\"in Litten's past work, the addition of hair, stuffed creatures, staples, screws, the scraps of paper or board that the work was made on, often created formal as well as emotional shift; important vehicles for helping the strange message within to reveal itself and go to work on the viewer\\". Often using humble domestic or found materials (including envelopes and assembled furniture parts) the work made at this time deliberately challenged ideas of art elitism and art as commodity. Retrospective exhibitions of Litten's early work have taken place at Royal Cornwall Museum and the Australia National University. Litten lived in London in the 1990s and later moved to Oxford where he worked as a photographic assistant and visits to the studio of Richard Hamilton encouraged a renewed interest in painting. 2000 to 2014 Dog Breeder 2007 Litten moved to Cornwall in 2001 and began exhibiting with Dick The Dog and then Goldfish, along with other independent art spaces in Bristol. His work at this time is considered to be highly emotional, subversive and haunting with subject matter that hints at both our animal impulses and spiritual yearnings. His figurative representations often appear ambiguously expressive and indefinite in sex. During these years, Litten's subject matter deals with issues of voyeurism, dysfunctional sexual attachments and behaviors. Litten's visual narratives at this time are questioning and considered to defy rather than define, with a likeness to the unpunctuated texts of Jack Kerouac. Dog Breeder Dog Breeder (which incorporates paint with human hair) uses a subverted sexual subtext to convey a twisted anti-art statement that comments on the absurdity of the contemporary art world and its hierarchies. The subject refers to the control of the art dealer over artists, and this is represented by the depiction of four sexualised dog-like figures that are on heat and clustering around one large dominant dog human. Dog Breeder was first exhibited in London, Vyner Street during Frieze art week 2007 and then in Cornwall the following year where it was described as sick and depraved. Recent Work Litten's dynamic and gestural figurative paintings express interest in a wide range of humanistic themes such as love, sensuality, fear, anger, loss, addiction and personal growth. His large scale gestural and impasto paintings are raw and emotive with introspective tensions that expose the visceral identity of the human subconscious. In 2018 Litten's solo exhibition was developed with support by Arts Council England.

It's commonly used in the Spanish cuisine of Castile, with the variants of Ar√©valo and Segovia being the most popular ones. Although it's also a beloved dish in Madrid and in some places in the regions of la Mancha and Arag√≥n. This oven dish is traditionally prepared in an earthenware pot and served hot with a crispy crust. It's recommended to combine cochinillo asado with wine. Cochinillo asado  History  Tost√≥n asado, just like roast lamb, forms part of the Castilian cuisine since the Roman conquest of Hispania. There are no recipes and descriptions available of the pre-Celtiberian period. In the 17th century, cochinillo asado became popular at bars and soup kitchens across the region of Castile. Little by little, it was served to travelers that were heading to Madrid. Yet in the middle of the 20th century, several taverns and restaurants in Segovia and Madrid claimed to have the best recipe in an attempt to attract tourists. C√°ndido is one of the most popular taverns, and the innkeeper became famous in the middle of the 20th century for accompanying the piglet dishes with songs. This ceremony gained international fame.  Preparation  Lots of markets and butcher shops in Spain offer cochinillo asado. According to some recipes, the piglet needs to be entirely cleaned, but without removing the kidneys. There are many different ways to prepare tost√≥n asado, with the same applying for chopping up the piglet. The preparation process includes cutting the piglet's stomach, as well as the backbone's center, followed by cleaning the interior part. The piglet is usually coated in batter, alongside pork fat, a bit of laurel, leaves and twigs, and prepared in an earthenware pot in an oven. In other regions they use white wine during the process to ensure the meat's tenderness. Tost√≥n asado is usually served in the same earthenware pot. It's also possible to marinate the meat parts during several days, and dehydrate them on the day of the roasting process. A wood- fired oven is traditionally used to roast piglets. Wine is one of the most widely accepted drinks to complement roast suckling pigs, according to gastronomic literature. Normally it's served with special decorations, with an apple on top of the piglet's mouth being one of the most common forms.

Early life Fatma Sultan was a daughter of Sultan Murad III, and his consort Safiye Sultan. She had two brothers, Sultan Mehmed III, and ≈ûehzade Mahmud, and a sister, Ay≈üe Sultan. Marriages On 6 December 1593, Fatma, at Murad's behest, married Halil Pasha, Admiral of the Fleet. The wedding took place at the Old Palace, and was celebrated in a seven-day ceremony. The historian Mustafa Selaniki described the excitement of the crowds who turned out to watch the elaborate processional that carried Fatma, who was concealed behind a screen of red satin, to the palace of her new husband. Selaniki wrote that at the wedding of Fatma \\"skirtfulls of shiny new coins were distributed... those who did not receive any sighed with longing.\\" According to the historian Hoca Sadeddin Efendi, her dowry was 300,000 ducats. As part of the celebrations, the members of the Imperial Council were given a seven-day leave. In 1595, Halil Pasha did not sail with the fleet. This was particularly because neither Safiye nor Fatma were willing to let him leave Istanbul. Their reluctance probably stemmed from the fact that Fatma was pregnant. She gave birth to a son in October 1595, which strengthened the new Sultan Mehmed's and Safiye's affection for Halil Pasha. After Halil Pasha's death in 1603, she married Hƒ±zƒ±r Pasha in December 1604. He was then in charge of securing the passes on the Danube.

An Anti- Federalist, he voted against the U.S. Constitution as a delegate to the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention. He was angered by perceived Federalist arrogance surrounding the adoption of the Constitution and thought that it provided too much power to the national government. He supported the American Revolution and wanted to limit wealthy Bostonians' sway over state politics. Early and personal life He was born in Sutton, Worcester County, Massachusetts, in September 1721. He was the first male birth in the town, the youngest son of Mary Grelee (or Greele) and John Singletary, a farmer and tithingman. John had moved to Sutton around 1720 and soon bought a lot on which he built a gristmill for municipal use. Singletary never attended school and learned only at home; despite this, town annals published in 1970 note that he was a keen learner in later life. An earnest Baptist, he signed a petition in 1742 asking for a parcel of land to be set aside in northern Sutton for a new church. In late 1747, several dozen churchgoers, including Singletary, broke off from the First Church of Sutton and formed their own in a part of town that is now Millbury. He was elected as a ruling elder of that church on February 4, 1768. He married Mary Curtis, from Topsfield, on September 6, 1742; she died on June 28, 1798. They had nine children, six girls and three boys. All worked in offices at the church, except his youngest, also named Amos, who town annals call a \\"profligate.\\" Singletary ran his father's gristmill along Singletary Stream from 1764 to 1777. He had purchased it from his brother, Richard, and later sold it to Abraham Waters. Political career Singletary represented his hometown of Sutton (red, with Worcester County in pink) at various conventions. On January 5, 1775, Singletary was elected to be a delegate of Sutton to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in Cambridge held on February 1. Later, on May 22, he was elected again, to a second congress in Watertown on May 31. He was nominated to be a justice of the peace on September 18 of that year, entering politics upon assuming the office. He and Willis Hall were elected May 19, 1777, to represent Sutton in the General Court in the coming year. In the next decade, Hall became the chair of Worcester County conventions that hoped to influence the Court; Singletary served in the House of Representatives in the 1781‚Äì82 and 1783‚Äì84 sessions, representing Sutton with Hall during the former. During the Revolutionary War, he was listed on a committee to train men in Worcester County to fight in New York and Canada, and as a legislator, he opposed eastern Massachusetts policies that, in his view, tormented western Massachusetts farmers. He was chosen on September 25, 1786, to be a delegate to a county convention in Leicester to ask for the state capital to be moved out of Boston. Many residents of western Massachusetts resented the influence of Boston elites over the state legislature, which they felt was taxing the Western region too heavily. This resentment also motivated Shays' Rebellion, an armed uprising that had emerged that summer. The town of Sutton selected Singletary as part of a committee to try to mediate between active rebels and the state government, which had sent thousands of troops to suppress the uprising. The delegation managed to meet with General Benjamin Lincoln, though the rebellion continued for many months more. Constitution Ratifying Convention Debate on ratification of the Constitution lasted for almost a month at the Massachusetts State House. Singletary is best known as a zealous, outspoken Anti-Federalist during Massachusetts's hearings on ratification of the United States Constitution in 1788. He and David Harwood became the delegates from Sutton on December 10, 1787, to the Massachusetts Ratifying Convention in Boston which began on January 9 of the next year. On January 25, 1788, over two weeks into the convention, Singletary spoke against the Constitution in response to Representative Fisher Ames. He argued that the federal government's powers under the Constitution would be similar to those held by Great Britain, from which they had just won independence. He worried that the interests of the common people would not be protected and became furious with Federalists' immodesty on pushing for ratification. He insisted‚Äîbreaking with some Anti-Federalists‚Äîthat the national government should ensure that officials pass a religious test. Other demands included opposition to a standing army and stricter term limits to avoid life tenure. The Massachusetts Centinel reported a section of his speech: Representative Jonathan Smith of Lanesborough responded. He cited Shays' Rebellion as justifying the need for a more centralized government, and said that the writers of the Constitution could be trusted. The Centinel quoted: Although Singletary was not the only delegate to voice opposition, Massachusetts ratified the Constitution on February 7, 1788, with a 187‚Äì168 vote. Sutton annals write that several town members‚Äîalong with other parts of the state‚Äîcelebrated its ratification. Later politics and death Singletary represented Sutton in the state senate, serving four consecutive one-year terms from 1787 to 1790. In the 1788 election, Singletary received 94% of his vote from Anti-Federalist towns in Worcester County and 4% from Federalist ones; compare this to the Federalist senator Moses Gill, also from Worcester, who received 83% from Anti-Federalist towns and 14% from Federalist ones. According to historian Jon L. Wakelyn, \\"It is unclear whether Singletary took part in post-1789 politics. There is some indication that he had moved to Maine.\\" He died on October 30, 1806, at age 85. His remains are interred in the County-Bridge Cemetery, on Providence Street along Blackstone River in Millbury, Massachusetts.

Synopsis The music video opens with Xu holding an umbrella standing on the banks of River Thames. As the song starts, Xu is seen lying on bed unmotivated. He finally got up but he is grieving i.e. crying while eating plain bread and breaking plates. As he was eating the bread, he remembered their happy times together. He saw the doll they bought and the camera they used while taking pictures of each other. He revisited the store where they bought the doll from and saw a single piece. He brought his other doll and placed it beside the lone piece. He finally threw all the pictures they took together and broke down crying. Lastly, there was a flashback scene where they had a date at the river bank. He went to that place again, as seen on the opening scene and let go of his umbrella. He smiled while leaving that place finally letting go of the past. Xu, wearing a black shirt with a black background singing along was shown between each scene.

IBA focusses on three business segments: cell selection, protein purification and oligo custom services. The company is the original manufacturer and supplier of the Strep-tag/Strep-Tactin technology, an affinity chromatography system developed for protein purification. The method is based on one of the strongest non-covalent interactions in nature, which is the interaction of biotin to streptavidin. An intrinsic binding affinity of the Strep-tag towards Strep-Tactin results in a highly specific interaction, which enables the isolation and purification of sensitive proteins in a native state as wells as intact protein complexes, respectively. The technology was patented by the Max Planck Society (former ‚ÄúGarching Innovations‚Äù) and later assigned to IBA. Recently, the method was further developed to be used for cell selection from whole blood or other single cell suspensions.  Products and technologies   Cell Selection & Expansion  IBA has developed an affinity chromatography system for non-magnetic isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T cells, B cells and other cells of interest. This technology is known as Fab-TACS (Traceless Affinity Cell Selection) and is based on Strep-tagged Fab fragments, which reversibly capture and release the target cells. This delivers label-free, non-activated cells suitable for immunologic or cell biological assays. The technology can be used with manual gravity flow columns as well as with the automated cell selection device FABian. Isolated and purified cells are being deployed for basic research as well as diagnostic applications. The Streptamers for cell expansion enable the controlled stimulation of T cells. They consist of non-magnetic soluble protein complexes generated by multimerization of Œ±CD3- and Œ±CD28 Fab-Streps with a Strep-Tactin multimer. The reversible reagents can be easily removed from the cells by the addition of biotin. This allows to regulate the extent of stimulation precisely and to study functional and label-free activated T cells.  Protein Production & Assays  The company exhibits a wide range of tools related to recombinant protein purification consisting of expression vectors, affinity purification and detection reagents based on its Strep- tag/Strep-Tactin system. This can be used for i.e. drug screening, diagnostic assays, immobilization and interaction studies. Due to its small size and biochemically almost inert character, the Strep-tag does not influence protein folding, secretion and function. The latest generation of the system is called Strep-Tactin XT. In combination with the Twin Strep-tag it binds the recombinant protein of interest with an extremely high affinity. This results in improved batch purification runs, higher yields of the expressed recombinant protein and a versatile approach for the immobilization on solid surfaces like beads, slides/arrays or microplates.  Custom Oligos & Predefined DNA/RNA  Modified oligonucleotides are being generated with a large variety of fluorescent labels as well as diverse base and backbone modifications. These include more than 50 chemical modifications and more than 200 dyes. Furthermore, the company offers Aptamers, small DNA, RNA (or peptide) molecules that show the ability to bind to specific target molecules. Aptamers have been widely used in medical and industrial fields.

The emperor Jahandar Shah who had came to power in 1712 was defeated by his nephew Farrukhsiyar in put to death in 1713. As he was helped by noble Sayad brothers, he was under their influence. He concluded treaty with Ajitsingh of Jodhpur. Daud Khan Panni, the powerful general, was appointed as the viceroy but there were riots in Ahmedabad in 1714. Ajitsingh was appointed as the next viceroy who had disputes with other noble Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n. After some reluctance, Ajitsingh let Kh√°n Daur√°n Nasrat Jang Bah√°dur to be appointed as the next viceroy. In 1719, the emperor Farrukhsiyar was deposed by influential Sayad brothers in 1719. He was succeeded by short reigns of Rafi ud-Darajat and Shah Jahan II. Finally Muhammad Shah was raised to the throne by them. Viceroys under Farrukhsiyar (1713‚Äì1719) This expedition of Farrukhsiyar was successful. He put Jahandar Shah to death and mounted the throne in 1713. As he had been raised to the throne mainly by the aid of Sayads Husain √Åli and Abdullah Kh√°n, the new emperor fell under the power of these nobles. Husain √Åli was sent against Aj√≠tsingh of M√°rw√°r, and concluded a treaty with that chief, whereby Aj√≠tsingh engaged to send his son to court and to give his daughter to the emperor in marriage: and the marriage was solemnised in 1715. In 1714, shortly after this treaty was concluded, Aj√≠tsingh sent his son Abheysingh to court, and on him in place of one Sayad √Åhmed G√≠l√°ni was conferred the post of governor of Sorath. Abheysingh remained at court and sent his deputy K√°yath Fatehsingh to Junagadh. Abd√∫l Ham√≠d Kh√°n was appointed revenue officer of Surat. After some time he resigned his Surat office and went to court, where on being made superintendent of the shrine of Sheikh Ahmed Khattu, he returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In 1713, Muhtarim Kh√°n was appointed to succeed him in Surat. Shah√°mat Kh√°n, Forty-fifth Viceroy, 1713 and D√°ud Kh√°n Panni, Forty-sixth Viceroy, 1714‚Äì15 Early in 1714, Shah√°mat Kh√°n, who had been appointed forty-fifth viceroy of Gujar√°t, was superseded by Daud Khan Panni as forty-sixth viceroy. The reckless courage of D√°ud Kh√°n Panni was renowned throughout India. His memory survives in the tales and proverbs of the Dakhan. On giving battle he used to show his contempt for his enemies by wearing nothing stronger than a muslin jerkin. So stern was his discipline that none of his Afgh√°n soldiers dared to touch a leaf of the standing crops where they were encamped. When at √Åhmed√°b√°d, he was either engaged in scattering the Kolis or in coursing with greyhounds. He preferred life under canvas on the S√°barmati sands to the viceregal surroundings of the Bhadra Palace. His civil work he used to trust to Dakhan Br√°hmans and Pandits. He was much devoted to the use of bhang. Until D√°ud Kh√°n's arrival, Abd√∫l Ham√≠d Kh√°n was appointed viceroy and took charge of the province from Shah√°mat Kh√°n. At this time, on the security of R√°ja Muhkamsingh of N√°gor, a sum of Rupees 50,000 was granted to the brother of Durg√°d√°s R√°tho·∏ç. ;Riots in √Åhmed√°b√°d, 1714 In 1714, in √Åhmed√°b√°d Har√≠r√°m, the agent of Madan Gop√°l a successful North Indian banker, who came to √Åhmed√°b√°d as treasurer with F√≠r√∫z Jang, while celebrating the Holi with his friends, seized a Muslim gentleman and handled him with great roughness. Aggrieved with this treatment the Muslim complained to a preacher of much eloquence and influence, Mulla Muhammad √Åli. The preacher took the Muslim to the Assembly Mosque and sent for Mulla Abd√∫l √Çz√≠z the chief or leading member of the Sunni Bohra community. He answered the call with a strong party of his men, and on his way was joined by numbers of Muslims both soldiers and citizens. With cries of ‚ÄòD√≠n‚Äô ‚ÄòD√≠n‚Äô, they went to the mosque and carried off the insulted man and the priest and the Bohra leader to the house of the K√°zi Khair-ul-l√°h. The K√°zi closed his doors against the crowd who returned abusing him to the Ratanpol pillaging and killing as they went. They next swarmed towards Madan Gop√°l's Haveli in the Ratanpol. But the Nagarsheth Kapurchand Bhans√°li closed its strong gates and with his Muslim soldiers met the swarm with firearms. The viceroy who was camped at the Shahibaug sent soldiers and under the influence of the leading citizens of both classes, the disturbance was quelled. When the particulars of the riots were known in the imperial camp, the Hindus, clamouring against Mulla Muhammad √Åli and Sheikh Abd√∫l √Çz√≠z Gujar√°ti, struck business and closed their shops. The emperor ordered mace-bearers to proceed to Gujar√°t and bring the Muslim ringleaders together with the Hindu Nagarsheth Kapurchand Bhans√°li. Some Bohras at the imperial camp, sending advance-news to √Åhmed√°b√°d, the Mullah, and the Bohra Sheth and after him, the Bhans√°li started for the imperial camp. On reaching the camp the Mulla, who was very impressive and eloquent, preached a sermon in the Assembly Mosque and his fame reaching the emperor, he was called to court and asked to preach. He and the Sheth were now able to explain their case to the emperor and the Bhans√°li was imprisoned. It is said that the Bhans√°li made the Mulla the medium of his release and that he and the Bohra returned to Gujar√°t while the Mulla remained in honour at court till he died. About the same time a great flood in the S√°barmati did much damage. Abd√∫l Ham√≠d Kh√°n was now chosen governor of Sorath in place of Abheysingh, and Mom√≠n Kh√°n was appointed from Delhi, governor of Surat, and was at the same time placed in charge of Baroda, Bharuch, Dholka, Petlad and Nadiad. D√°ud Kh√°n, the viceroy now went into Kathiawad and Nawanaagr to collect tribute, and on his return to √Åhmed√°b√°d, married the daughter of the chief of Halvad in the Jhalawad. It is related that this lady, who was with child, on hearing of D√°ud Kh√°n's death cut open her womb and saved the child at the sacrifice of her own life. D√°ud Kh√°n, though an excellent soldier and strict disciplinarian failed to distinguish himself as a civil administrator. He introduced Dakhani pandits into official posts, who levied a fee called chithy√°man from landholders and took taxes from the holdings of Sayads and otherwise made themselves unpopular. About this time Mom√≠n Kh√°n, governor of Surat, arrived in Gujar√°t, and placing his deputies in Petl√°d, Dholka, Baroda, and Na·∏çi√°d, went himself to Surat in 1715. Here he was opposed by the commandant of the fort, Zia Kh√°n, who was obliged to give way, his subordinate, Sayad K√°sim, being defeated by Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n. There were Hindu-Muslim riots again in Ahmedabad in 1715. On this account, and for other reasons, D√°ud Kh√°n was recalled, and Ghazni Kh√°n Jh√°lori was directed to act in his place until the arrival of a new viceroy. Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh, Forty- seventh Viceroy, 1715‚Äì16 In 1715, the Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh was appointed forty-seventh viceroy of Gujar√°t, and his son Kunvar Abheysingh was appointed governor of Sorath. Aj√≠tsingh sent Vajer√°j Bhand√°ri to act as his deputy until his arrival, and Fatehsingh K√°yath was chosen deputy governor of Sorath. Perhaps one of the most remarkable appointments of this time was that of Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n to be minister as well as military commandant of Baroda, N√°ndod, Arhar-M√°tar (in Kheda district), and of the ports of Surat and Cambay. Haidar K√∫li chose an officer to act for him as minister, and after appointing deputies in his different charges himself went to Surat. The Mah√°r√°ja Aj√≠tsingh, on reaching √Åhmed√°b√°d, appointed Ghazni Kh√°n Jh√°lori governor of Palanpur and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n B√°bi governor of Radhanpur. During this year an imperial order conferred on Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, Sorath and Gohilwad or south- east Kathiawad then in charge of Fatehsingh, the viceroy's deputy. On receiving this order Haidar sent Sayad √Çkil as his deputy, and that officer went to Jambusar, and, collecting men, set out to join his appointment. He first camped at Loli√°nah, where the province of Sorath begins, and from Loli√°nah marched against Palitana and plundered the town. ;Disagreement between the Viceroy and Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, 1715 The viceroy, who was by no means well disposed to Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, sent a message that if any injury was done in Sorath he would take vengeance on the aggressors; and as neither Aj√≠tsingh nor Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n was of a very compliant temper, civil war was on the point of breaking out. By the help of Sal√°bat Kh√°n B√°bi, the deputy in Gohilwad, matters were arranged, and Sayad √Çkil returned from Sorath. Haidar was anxious to send Sal√°bat Kh√°n as deputy to Sorath. But as Sal√°bat demanded too high a salary, Raza K√∫li, brother of the late governor of Baroda, was chosen. When this officer, with his brother Ma√¢s√∫m K√∫li, reached Amreli, Fatehsingh, the viceroy's deputy, evacuated Jun√°ga·∏çh. After this Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n, in company with K√°z√≠m Beg, governor of Baroda, marched against and defeated the chief of Munjpur (near R√°dhanpur), who had refused to pay the usual tribute. The viceroy went to Sorath to collect the imperial revenue, and, owing to his excessive demands, met with armed resistance from the J√°m of Nawanagar. Finally, the matter of tribute was settled, and after visiting the shrine of Dwarka, the viceroy returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Kh√°n Daur√°n Nasrat Jang Bah√°dur, Forty-eighth Viceroy, 1716‚Äì1719 In 1716, while the viceroy was at Dwarka, in consequence of numerous complaints against Aj√≠tsingh and his M√°rw√°ri followers, the emperor sent Sams√°m-ud-daulah Kh√°n Daur√°n Nasrat Jang Bah√°dur as forty-eighth viceroy of Gujar√°t. As it was expected that Aj√≠tsingh would not give up his government without a contest, an army was prepared to compel him to leave. On the arrival of the army, Aj√≠tsingh marched straight on √Åhmed√°b√°d and encamped at Sarkhej, but Nahar Kh√°n persuaded him to retire to Jodhpur without giving battle. In 1717, after the departure of Aj√≠tsingh, Haidar K√∫li Khan, who had been appointed deputy viceroy, leaving Surat set out for √Åhmed√°b√°d. When Haidar arrived at Petl√°d, some of the √Åhmed√°b√°d nobles, among whom was Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi, went out to meet him. A dispute arose between one of Haidar's water carriers and a water-carrier in the army of the B√°bi, which increased to a serious affray, which from the camp followers spread to the soldiers and officers, and the B√°bi's baggage was plundered. Safdar Kh√°n took serious offence, and returning to √Åhmed√°b√°d collected his kinsmen and followers and marched against Haidar K√∫li Kh√°n. In a battle fought on the following day Safdar Kh√°n was defeated.

History  The Moors and Christians Festival of Alcoy, in honor of Saint George was declared of International Tourist Interest in 1980 and is the origin for all the Moors and Christians festivals celebrated in the Valencian Community. In 1276, different historical figures related to the various Muslim uprisings taking place in the region led to Saint George being recognized as the patron of Alcoy, who is attributed to the intervention in a battle to defend the population who were under attack by the Muslims. It was in this battle when the Muslim leader Al-Azraq is reputed to have been killed and the place where the battle took part is now called The Ravine of the Battle in Spanish Barranco de la Batalla. Today it is accepted that the Moors and Christians festivities has a marked and established three-day structure, but it is generally not known what the evolution of a festivities has been, which was originated in a strictly religious commemoration. Tradition marks the date of April 23, 1276 as the beginning of the patronage of St. George for Alcoy, for his miraculous intervention, as narrated by our ancestors, in the defence of Alcoy from the Muslim attack of Al-Azraq. Soon there was a chapel dedicated to the Saint, which is already known shortly after 1300, in fact, there are documents of 1317 because it was perpetual vowed to honor him in his festivity. Thus, the current structure of three days, dedicated the first one to the ' 'Entradas' ' or parade, the second to the religious festivity and the third to the ' 'Alardo, culminating with the appearance of San Jorge, begins to be gestating taking as axis the festivity of San Jorge, the day 23 of April. Initially, the documents speak to us of a religious celebration, basically, but already in 1412, there is information about some payments made for the celebration of the religious festivity. However, it was at the beginning of the 16th century when the Town Hall decided to give more importance to the celebration, including profane acts. In this aspect, in 1552 was organized an ' ' arcabucer√≠a ' ' contest where the local militias took part, and the logical variants will originate later the ' ' Alardo ' ', that nowadays corresponds to the celebrations of the third day of the festivities when the actual battle take part. In 1672, Vicente Carbonell in his work \\"C√©lebre Centuria\\" speaks about two companies: one of Christians Moors and the other of Catholic Christians, which originated the current division of Moorish and Christian sides. With the victory of Philip V in the War of Succession, the city of Alcoy was treated as an enemy for having been a supporter of the Archduke Charles, and it will not be until 1741 when the festivities were again celebrated. Dated on the same year, the Chronicle of Father Picher, said that the eve of the Saint, the 22nd of April, the captains and military officers made a \\"colorful walk\\"; this walk or parade is the one that with the passage of time will give rise to the entradas, both Christian and Moorish. Also referred to the same year 1741 and according to Father Picher, for the following day of the Saint, day 24, an artificial castle was built up, called Aduar del Puche. It also says that in the morning, after an embassy, the Moors took the castle, but that in the afternoon, using also an ambassador, the Christians surrendered the castle by force of arms. This corresponds practically to the current structure of the day of the ' ' Alardo ' ', although in order for it to be complete the appearance of Saint George on the battlements of the castle is missing. However, in 1743, always according to Fr. Picher, the \\"apparition of the Saint over the walls of the Villa\\" was arranged. In the middle of the XVIII century, the elements that form festivities were determined, and with the logical evolution of more than 250 years, the current structure of the Moors and Christians Festival of Alcoy was established. Shortly afterward, at the end of the 18th century, the ' 'Filaes' ' (troupes in English) appeared, some of which have survived to the present day. Practically at the beginning of the 20th century thirteen Moorish ' 'filaes' ' were already structured, being completed in the last quarter of that century, with a fourteenth ' 'fil√†' '. In the Christian side, although some of the initial ' 'filaes' ' remain, it has had many more changes and the current fourteen ' 'filaes' ' will not be settled until the sixties of the last century.  Museum  The Museu Alcoi√† de la Festa MAF (English: Museum of the Moors and Christians of Alcoy) in Alcoy, is a museum dedicated entirely to the festival of the Moros y Cristianos of Alcoy, where the visitors can experience all the details, aspects and feelings surrounding this international festival.  Dates  The official Alcoy festival calendar states that the celebrations will take place on 22, 23 and 24 April, but it is possible that these dates may be altered due to Easter week.

The screenplay was written by Paul Schofield and William DuBois from a story by Miguel de Z√°rraga. Plot In the California of the late 1800s, Jos√© Antonio Romero hears of the nearby discovery of gold. Wanting to provide his fianc√©, Carmela, with all the good things in life, he decides to go hunt for gold. He tells his friend, Francisco, who is a Brother at a nearby mission, of his intentions and the reason. Carmela, who also lives near the mission, is having second thoughts about her relationship with Jos√©. When she is kidnapped by bandits, Francisco, who is unaware that she is his friend's fianc√©, goes off to her rescue. After freeing her, the two begin to have an attraction for each other. When Francisco realizes she is Jos√©'s beloved, he begins to distance himself, although he is attracted to her. Carmela, equally attracted to Francisco, is dismayed to learn that he is a member of the religious order. When one of the miners, Jaime, arrives at the mission and tells Francisco that Estaban, another miner, has been stabbed at the mining camp, Francisco does not hesitate to head out to the camp to render aid. On his return, he is forced to seek shelter in a cave due to a sudden storm. While in the cave, he accidentally discovers a large vein of gold. He struggles with his desire for Carmela, who he fantasizes about living happily ever after if he took the gold, left the religious order, and married her. In the end, his commitment to his religious devotion wins out, and he decides to tell his friend Jos√© the gold's location. However, Jos√© has been told by another villager of the seeming infatuation growing between Francisco and Carmela. Consumed by jealousy, Jos√© confronts Francisco, accusing him of betraying their friendship. He attacks the Brother with a knife, but in the ensuing fight, Francisco convinces Jos√© that nothing untoward occurred between him and Carmela, and Jos√© asks for his friend's forgiveness. Now able to support his fianc√©, Jos√© asks Francisco to sing at his wedding, which Francisco gladly does.

A subsidiary of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the railway used former Turtle Creek Valley Railroad tracks that Westinghouse rebuilt and extended from Trafford through Wilmerding to East Pittsburgh along the right bank (northern side) of the creek. The railroad transported freight between the Westinghouse plants and also tested and demonstrated electric rail cars. History of Operations: 1902-1962 A 1904 promotional article for the Westinghouse Interworks Railway The Westinghouse Interworks Railway was chartered on February 25, 1902, and on April 8 of the following year the company signed a 25-year lease allowing its trains to operate over a portion of the East Pittsburgh Branch owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). J.C. Bair, a civil engineer for the PRR, was assigned as superintendent of the Interworks Railway in June 1903. The Interworks Railway began limited service on August 9, 1903, and became fully operational on December 1, 1904. This company shipped raw materials and finished products between the Westinghouse facilities charging tonnage fees for the freight and hourly fees for the labor. The line shuttled factory workmen to and from their jobs as well. Exhibition of 135 ton Baldwin- Westinghouse electric locomotive to members of the International Railway Congress on May 16, 1905 Ridership on this line was not limited to workmen, and the vehicles that rode the rails were not limited to steam powered freight trains. A portion of the railway was electrified, allowing its use for the testing and promotion of Westinghouse's new electric trains. One such promotional event occurred in 1905, when during an international railway congress the track was used to demonstrate a new 1500 horsepower Baldwin- Westinghouse single-phase alternating-current electric locomotive. This locomotive type was then shipped out of the plant via the railway in 1906. By 1938 the railway owned over 40 pieces of rolling stock, which it operated along five miles of track between Trafford and East Pittsburgh. Maps indicate that Westinghouse owned only the portions of the track nearest its facilities, with the connecting segments being owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad company. However long-term Interworks Railway superintendent J.C. Bair believed his company compared well to the much larger railroad from which it leased track rights; he was known to often say, ‚ÄúOur tracks may not be as long as the Pennsylvania‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre just as wide.‚Äù A 21st century evaluation also echoed the relative importance of the Westinghouse interworks Railway, opining that it had played a greater role in the creation and growth of the borough of Trafford than did the neighboring Turtle Creek Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Post Operational Years : 1962 - present The Airbrake Park Walking Trail follows part of the path of the old Westinghouse Interworks Railway in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. The buildings of the Westinghouse Air Brake Company can be seen across Turtle Creek. A large flood control project stretching from the 1950s through the '60s included a change to the banks of the Turtle Creek waterway that required the removal of Interworks tracks between Wilmerding and Pitcairn, and the decision was made not to rebuild them. Thus on September 30, 1962, the rail link on the right bank of Turtle Creek between Trafford and Wilmerding was severed, and nearly all of its track between these two boroughs was eventually removed. Most of this track-bed now lies abandoned, save for a fraction of a mile in Wilmerding which became the Airbrake Avenue Walking Trail. Proposals exist to convert the rest of the abandoned line into a rail-trail as well. Remnants of the railway lie idle between Turtle Creek and the Keystone Commons in Turtle Creek, PA The remaining portion of the railroad west of Wilmerding was never formally abandoned, and has been acquired by the Regional Industrial Development Corporation of Southwestern Pennsylvania (RIDC) who also purchased the old Westinghouse Electric plant adjacent to the rail, renaming it, \\"The Keystone Commons\\". Since this acquisition some limited rail activity has been observed at the southernmost section of The Commons in East Pittsburgh, where a locomotive from the adjoining Union Railroad has been occasionally spotted pushing deliveries. Farther north in the borough of Turtle Creek the remainder of the tracks appear to have fallen into prolonged disuse, as it was reported that no trains have traveled there since the 1980s. Controversy over this idle section of track arose in 2014 when Allegheny County replaced the Greensburg Pike bridge, which passed over the remnants of the railway. The rails had to be temporarily removed during part of the bridge constriction; their owner wanted them replaced, and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission agreed that the county was obligated to replace them. Local civic leaders as well as neighboring businessmen voiced their objections, questioning the wisdom of using public funds to restore unused track, arguing that the money could have been better spent. The county ultimately spent $365,000 restoring the rails. The 10.114 acres of vacant industrial land on which they lie was assessed at $39,700 in 2017. No specific plans to restore train service on the tracks were reported.

Biography  Ayyub Huseynov was born in Khok in Norashen district (now Kangarli) of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. His first education was received in 1930 in the Azerbaijan Painting Technique in Baku and later in 1935 at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts. Education at the Academy of Art in Tbilisi was accompanied by difficulties and successes in mastering artistic skills and deep knowledge. During his studies in Tbilisi, he has learned from the prominent Georgian artists and has mastered the skills of perfection in painting. After completing higher education, he returned to Nakhchivan. During his life in Nakhchivan, he produced artworks for the young artists, who created works of various genres and performances staged at the local theater. Here he has prepared artistic designs and costume sketches for many performances with well-known painter Shamil Gaziyev. In the theater of Nakhchivan, he created costume sketches and paintings for plays like Abdurrahim bey Hagverdiyev's \\"Peri-cadu\\", \\"Farhad and Shirin\\" of Samad Vurgun, \\"Vatan\\" by Abdulla Shaig, \\"Polad\\" by Nagi Nagiyev, \\"Gunash doƒüur\\" by Abulfaz Abbasguliyev. A young artist, who was convinced that the artistic environment of Baku will create more opportunities for his future career, moved from Nakhchivan to the capital in 1948. By that, he became a teacher where he studied for the first time. Along with teaching at the Azerbaijan State Art School named after Azim Azimzade, he was also engaged in independent creativity. Ayyub Huseynov, who has been teaching here since 1948, worked as a school director in 1956-1965. During this period, a successful outcome of the school teaching process was that most of our artists and sculptors, representing Azerbaijan's deserving art in the world, have been trained in the years when he was the director. He played an important role in the history of \\"Azimzadeh School\\", which was the prestigious educational institution in the former USSR. While it is difficult to combine pedagogical activity with creativity, Ayyub Huseynov managed to succeed. An artist who has been participating in exhibitions in Baku and the former USSR, as well as outside the country borders, has introduced himself as a master artist in all genres of his own art.

In 1923 it became the Compagnie fermi√®re des chemins de fer tunisiens.  History  Evolution of the Tunisian railway network between 1880 and 1941 The Bone-Guelma Railway Company was founded in 1875. The concession for construction of the line from Bone to Guelma, between the French government and the Soci√©t√© de Construction des Batignolles, was ceded by the latter in 1876 to the B√¥ne-Guelma Railway Company, which had been founded by Ernest Go√ºin, with the assistance of the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, of which Go√ºin was a director. The Bone-Guelma company contracted with Batignolles to build the line. It developed its network in Algeria and Tunisia with respectively and in each of the two countries. The line had a station at Taya, eight kilometers by mule track from the Djebel Taya antimony mine . The Algerian network was purchased by the State on 6 June 1914 and operated from 1 April 1915 by Algerian State Railways. In 1922, the Tunisian government bought the Tunisian part of the network and entrusted operations to the Compagnie fermi√®re des chemins de fer tunisiens by an agreement of 22 June 1922. On June 8, 1923, a general meeting of shareholders took note of the change in the company's activities by changing its name to the Compagnie fermi√®re des chemins de fer tunisiens.

Gujarat (now in India) was managed by the viceroys appointed by the emperors. The emperor Muhammad Shah (1719‚Äì1748) died in 1748 and he was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah Bahadur. He appointed Vakhatsingh, brother of Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh of Marwar as a viceroy but he never took a charge. Sensing opportunity in weakening Mughal power, the Marathas and the Mughal nobles started plotting to establish themselves in Gujarat. The Maratha houses, Gaikwar and Peshwa, engaged in a struggle and finally brokered a peace. Jawan Mard Khan, who was in charge of Ahmedabad, had to surrender to them after a long siege. Thus the Marathas established themselves firmly in Gujarat in 1752. In 1754, Ahmad Shah Bahadur was deposed and Alamgir II came to power on the Mughal throne. Viceroys under Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1748‚Äì1754)  Mah√°r√°ja Vakhatsingh, Fifty-ninth Viceroy, 1748 The emperor Muhammad Shah died in 1748 and he was succeeded by his son Ahmad Shah Bahadur. Shortly after his accession Mah√°r√°ja Vakhatsingh, brother of Mah√°r√°ja Abheysingh, was appointed fifty-ninth viceroy of Gujar√°t. When he learned what was the state of the province, he pleaded that his presence would be more useful in his own dominions, and never took up his appointment of viceroy. Vakhatsingh was the last viceroy of Gujar√°t nominated by the imperial court, for although by the aid of the Mar√°th√°s Fakhr-ud-daulah was of importance in the province, he had never been able to establish himself as viceroy. In this year also occurred the death of Khush√°lchand Sheth, the chief merchant of Ahmedabad. Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r appointed R√°ghavshankar his deputy at √Åhmed√°b√°d, and Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi issued from √Åhmed√°b√°d with an army to levy tribute from the chiefs on the banks of the Sabarmati river. When Fakhr-ud- daulah, the former viceroy, heard of the appointment of Mah√°r√°ja Vakhatsingh, seeing no chance of any benefit from a longer stay in Gujar√°t, he retired to Delhi. In 1748, √Åsif J√°h, Niz√°m-ul-Mulk, died at an advanced age, leaving six sons and a disputed succession. ;Disorder Spreads. About the same time B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa, who was jealous of the power of the G√°ikw√°r, sent a body of troops, and freed Rangoji from the hands of Khander√°v G√°ikw√°r. During these years adventurers, in different parts of the country, taking advantage of the decay of the central power, endeavoured to establish themselves in independence. Of these attempts the most formidable was the revolt of one of the P√°tan Kasb√°tis who established his power so firmly in P√°tan that Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n found it necessary to proceed in person to reduce him. Shortly afterwards Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n deemed it advisable to recall his brothers Safdar Kh√°n and Zor√°war Kh√°n, who were then at Unjha under P√°tan, and took them with him to √Åhmed√°b√°d. Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n who had been residing at Atarsumba (near Vadodara) now asked permission to return to √Åhmed√°b√°d, but as Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n did not approve of this suggestion, Fid√°-ud-d√≠n departed to Bharuch and there took up his residence. Jan√°rdhan Pandit marched to Kaira (Kheda) and the Bh√≠l district to levy tribute, and Khander√°v appointed Shevakr√°m his deputy. ;Surat Affairs, 1750. In the meantime at Surat, Sayad Achchan endeavoured to consolidate his rule, and with this view tried to expel H√°fiz Mas√ªud Habsh√≠, and prevent him again entering the city. But his plans failed, and he was obliged to make excuses for his conduct. Sayad Achchan then oppressed other influential persons, until eventually the Habsh√≠ and others joining, attacked him in the citadel. Except the English leader Mr. Lamb, who considered himself bound by the deed signed in 1747 in favour of Sayad Achchan, all the merchants of Surat joined the assailants. Among the chief opponents of Sayad Achchan were the Dutch, who sending ships brought back Safdar Muhammad Kh√°n from Thatta, and established him as governor of Surat. The English factory was next besieged, and, though a stout resistance was made, the guards were bribed, and the factory plundered. In 1750 Sayad Achchan, surrendering the citadel to the Habsh√≠, withdrew first to Bombay and then to Poona, to B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa. Shortly afterwards, in consequence of the censure passed upon him by the Bombay Government for his support of Sayad Achchan, Mr. Lamb committed suicide. Wearied by these continual contests for power, the merchants of Surat asked R√°ja Raghunathd√°s, minister to the Niz√°m, to choose them a governor. R√°ja Raghunathd√°s accordingly nominated his own nephew, R√°ja Harpras√°d, to be governor, and the writer of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi to be his deputy. But before R√°ja Harpras√°d could join his appointment at Surat, both he and his father were slain in battle. In 1750, occurred the deaths of R√°ja R√°isingh of Idar, of Safdar Kh√°n B√°bi of Balasinor, and of Fid√°-ud-d√≠n Kh√°n, who had for some time been settled at Bharuch. ;Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and the Peshwa, 1750. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, who, seeing that they were inclined to become permanent residents in Gujar√°t, was always opposed to the G√°ikw√°r's power, now entered into negotiations with B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa. He chose Patel Sukhdev to collect the Mar√°tha revenue and asked the Peshwa to help him in expelling D√°m√°ji's agents. The Peshwa, being now engaged in war in the Dakhan with Sal√°bat Jang Bah√°dur, son of the late Niz√°m, was unable to send Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n any assistance. Towards the close of the year Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n started from √Åhmed√°b√°d to collect tribute from the S√°barmati chiefs. Returning early in 1751, at the request of Jetha Patel a subordinate of Bh√°vsingh Des√°i, he proceeded to Banod or Vanod under Viramgam and reduced the village. √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n, the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi, who about this time was raised in rank with the title of Bah√°dur, states that owing to the Mar√°tha inroads most of the districts had passed entirely into their possession; in others according to agreements with Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n they held a half share. Consequently, in spite of new taxes, the entire remaining income of the province was only four l√°khs of rupees, and it was impossible to maintain the military posts or control the rebellious Kolis. ;The Peshwa and G√°ikw√°r, 1751 In 1751, the Peshwa, decoying D√°m√°jir√°v into his power, imprisoned him and forced him to surrender half of his rights and conquests in Gujar√°t. Taking advantage of the absence of the G√°ikw√°r and his army in the Dakhan, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n marched into Sorath. He first visited Ghogha, and then levying tribute in Gohilwad advanced into Kathiawad and marched against Nawanagar, and, after collecting a contribution from the J√°m, returned to √Åhmed√°b√°d. In 1752, as soon as the news reached Gujar√°t that the Mar√°th√°s‚Äô share in the province had been divided between the Peshwa and G√°ikw√°r, Mom√≠n Kh√°n, who was always quarrelling with the G√°ikw√°r's agent, sending Varajl√°l his steward to B√°l√°jir√°v Peshwa begged him to include Cambay in his share and send his agent in place of the G√°ikw√°r's agent. B√°l√°jir√°v agreed, and from that time an agent of the Peshwa was established at Cambay. In the same year Raghun√°thr√°v, brother of the Peshwa, entering Gujar√°t took possession of the Rewa and Mahi K√°ntha districts and marched on Surat. Shiaji Dhangar was appointed in Shevakr√°m's place as D√°m√°ji's deputy, and Krishn√°ji came to collect the Peshwa's share. ;Bharuch Independent, 1752 Up to this time the city of Bharuch had remained part of the Niz√°m's personal estate, managed by Abd√∫llah Beg, whom, with the title of Nek √Ålam Kh√°n, √Åsif J√°h the late Niz√°m-ul-Mulk had chosen his deputy. On the death of Abd√∫llah Beg in 1752 the emperor appointed his son to succeed him with the same title as his father, while he gave to another son, named Mughal Beg, the title of Khertalab Kh√°n. During the contests for succession that followed upon the death of the Niz√°m in 1752, no attempt was made to enforce the Niz√°m's claims on the lands of Bharuch; and for the future, except for the share of the revenue paid to the Mar√°th√°s, the governors of Bharuch were practically independent. ;P√°ndurang Pandit Repulsed at √Åhmed√°b√°d, 1752. The Peshwa now sent P√°ndurang Pandit to levy tribute from his share of Gujar√°t, and that officer crossing the Mahi marched upon Cambay. Mom√≠n Kh√°n prepared to oppose him, but the Pandit made friendly overtures, and eventually Mom√≠n Kh√°n not only paid the sum of Rupees 7000 for grass and grain for the Pandit's troops, but also lent him four small cannon. P√°ndurang Pandit then marched upon √Åhmed√°b√°d, and encamping near the Kankaria Lake laid siege to the city which was defended by Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n. During the siege P√°ndurang Pandit, sending some troops, ravaged Nikol, part of the lands of √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n Bah√°dur, the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi. Meanwhile, as the operations against √Åhmed√°b√°d made no progress, P√°ndurang Pandit made offers of peace. These Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n accepted, and on receiving from Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n the present of a mare and a small sum of money under the name of entertainment, the Mar√°tha leader withdrew to Sorath. ;Mar√°tha Invasion. About this time the Peshwa released D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r on his promise to help the Peshwa's brother Raghun√°thr√°v, who was shortly afterwards despatched with an army to complete the conquest of Gujar√°t. Meanwhile, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's anxiety regarding the Mar√°th√°s was for a time removed by the departure of P√°ndurang Pandit. And, as the harvest season had arrived, he with his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi, leaving Muhammad Mub√°riz Sherw√°ni behind as his deputy, set out from √Åhmed√°b√°d to levy tribute from the chiefs of the Sabarkantha. Certain well informed persons, who had heard of Raghun√°thr√°v's preparations for invading Gujar√°t, begged Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n not to leave the city but to depute his brother Zor√°war Kh√°n B√°bi to collect the tribute. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, not believing their reports, said that he would not go more than from forty-five to sixty miles from the city, and that, should the necessity of any more distant excursion arise, he would entrust it to his brother. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n then marched from the city, levying tribute until he arrived on the P√°lanpur frontier about seventy-five miles north of √Åhmed√°b√°d. Here meeting Muhammad Bah√°dur Jh√°lori, the governor of Palanpur, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was foolishly induced to join him in plundering the fertile districts of Sirohi, till at last he was not less than 150 miles from his headquarters. Meanwhile, Raghun√°thr√°v, joining D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, entered suddenly by an unusual route into Gujar√°t, and news reached √Åhmed√°b√°d that the Mar√°th√°s had crossed the Narmada river. On this the townspeople sent messenger after messenger to recall Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and building up the gateways prepared for defence, while the inhabitants of the suburbs, leaving their houses, crowded with their families into the city for protection. Raghun√°thr√°v, hearing that Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n and his army were absent from the city, pressed on by forced marches, and crossing the Mahi river despatched an advance corps under Vithal Sukhdev. Kos√°ji, proprietor of Nadiad, at D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r's invitation also marched towards √Åhmed√°b√°d, plundering Mehm√∫d√°b√°d Khokhri, only three miles from the city. In the meantime Vithal Sukhdev reached Kaira (Kheda), and taking with him the chief man of that place, Muhammad Daur√°n, son of Muhammad B√°bi, continued his march. He was shortly joined by Raghun√°thr√°v, and the combined forces now proceeded to √Åhmed√°b√°d and encamped by the K√°nkaria lake. Next day Raghun√°thr√°v moved his camp to near the tomb of Sh√°h Bh√≠kan, on the bank of the Sabarmati river to the south-west of the city. Raghun√°thr√°v now proceeded to invest the city, distributing his thirty to forty thousand horse into three divisions. The operations against the north of the city were entrusted to D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r; those on the east to Gop√°l Hari; while the troops on the south and west were under the personal command of Raghun√°thr√°v and his officers. After leaving Sirohi, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n had gone westwards to Tharad and Vav, so that the first messengers failed to find him. One of the later messengers, M√°ndan by name, who had not left √Åhmed√°b√°d until the arrival of Raghun√°thr√°v at the K√°nkaria lake, made his way to V√°v and Thar√°d, and told Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n what had happened. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n set out by forced marches for Radhanpur, and leaving his family and the bulk of his army at P√°tan, he pushed on with 200 picked horsemen to Kadi and from that to √Åhmed√°b√°d, contriving to enter the city by night. The presence of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n raised the spirits of the besieged, and the defence was conducted with ardour. In spite of their watchfulness, a party of about 700 Mar√°th√°s under cover of night succeeded in scaling the walls and entering the city. Here they could do any mischief they were discovered and driven out of the town with much slaughter. The bulk of the besieging army, which had advanced in hopes that this party would succeed in opening one of the city gates, were forced to retire disappointed. Raghun√°thr√°v now made proposals for peace, but Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n did not think it consistent with his honour to accept them. On his refusal, the Mar√°tha general redoubled his efforts and sprung several mines, but owing to the thickness of the city walls no practicable breach was effected. Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n now expelled the Mar√°tha deputies, and continuing to defend the city with much gallantry contrived at night to introduce into the town by detachments a great portion of his army from P√°tan. At length, embarrassed by want of provisions and the clamour of his troops for pay, he extorted Rupees 50,000 from the official classes. As Jaw√°n Mard was known to have an ample supply of money of his own this untimely meanness caused great discontent. The official classes who were the repository of all real power murmured against his rule and openly advocated the surrender of the city, and Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, much against his will, was forced to enter into negotiations with Raghun√°thr√°v. Raghun√°thr√°v was so little hopeful of taking √Åhmed√°b√°d that he had determined, should the siege last a month longer, to depart on condition of receiving the one-fourth share of the revenue and a safe conduct. Had Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n only disbursed his own money to pay the troops, and encouraged instead of disheartening the official class, he need never have lost the city. At last to Raghun√°thr√°v's relief, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n was reduced to treat for peace through Vithal Sukhdev. It was arranged that the Mar√°th√°s should give Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n the sum of Rupees 1 l√°kh to pay his troops, besides presenting him with an elephant and other articles of value. It was at the same time agreed that the garrison should leave the city with all the honours of war. And that, for himself and his brothers, Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n should receive, free from any Mar√°tha claim, the districts of Patan, Vadnagar, Sami, Munjpur, Visnagar, Thar√°d, Kheralu, and R√°dhanpur with Tervada and Vijapur. It was further agreed that one of Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's brothers should always serve the Mar√°th√°s with 300 horse and 500 foot, the expenses of the force being paid by the Mar√°th√°s. It was also stipulated that neither the Peshwa's army nor his deputy's, nor that of any commander should enter Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n's territory, and that in √Åhmed√°b√°d no Mar√°tha official should put up at any of the Kh√°n Bah√°dur's mansions, new or old, or at any of those belonging to his brothers followers or servants. Finally that the estates of other members of the family, namely Kaira, Kasba M√°tar and B√°nsa Mahudha, which belonged to Muhammad Kh√°n, Kh√°n Daur√°n, and √Åbid Kh√°n were not to be meddled with, nor were encroachments to be allowed on the lands of K√°yam K√∫li Kh√°n or of Zor√°war Kh√°n. This agreement was signed and sealed by Raghun√°thr√°v, with D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r (half sharer), Malh√°rr√°v Holkar, Jye √Åpa Sindhia, R√°mchandar Vithal Sukhdev, Sakh√°r√°m Bhagvant, and M√°dhavr√°v Gop√°lr√°v as securities. The treaty was then delivered to Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n, and he and his garrison, marching out with the honours of war, the Mar√°th√°s took possession of √Åhmed√°b√°d on 2 April 1753. On leaving √Åhmed√°b√°d Jaw√°n Mard Kh√°n retired to P√°tan. At √Åhmed√°b√°d Raghun√°thr√°v with D√°m√°ji arranged for the government of the city, appointing Shripatr√°v his deputy. He then marched into Jhalawad to levy tribute from the Limbdi and Wadhwan chiefs; and was so far successful that Harbhamji of Limb·∏çi agreed to pay an annual tribute of Rupees 40,000. As the rainy season was drawing near Raghun√°thr√°v returned to Dholka, while Patel Vithal Sukhdev forced Muhammad Bah√°dur, the governor of Palanpur, to consent to a payment of Rupees 1,15,000. From Dholka, Raghun√°thr√°v went to T√°r√°pur, about twelve miles north of Cambay (Khambhat), and compelled Mom√≠n Kh√°n to submit to an annual payment of Rupees 10,000. At the same time √Åli Muhammad Kh√°n Bah√°dur, the author of the MirƒÉt-i- √Åhmedi, was appointed collector of customs, and his former grants were confirmed and he was allowed to retain his villages of Sayadpur and K√ªj√°dh close to √Åhmed√°b√°d, as well as the village of P√°nm√ªl in Vij√°pur. D√°m√°ji G√°ikw√°r, after levying tribute in the V√°trak K√°ntha, went to Kapadvanj, which he took from Sher Kh√°n B√°bi. From Kapadvanj he passed to Na·∏çi√°d and appointed Shevakr√°i to collect his half share of the revenue of Gujar√°t. ;Mughal Coinage Ceases In the √Åhmed√°b√°d mint, coin ceased to be struck in the emperor's name and the suburbs of the city which had been deserted during the siege were not again inhabited. The Kolis commenced a system of depredation, and their outrages were so daring that women and children were sometimes carried off and sold as slaves. After the rains were over (1754) Shetuji, commander of the √Åhmed√°b√°d garrison, and Shankarji, governor of V√≠ramg√°m, were sent to collect tribute from Sorath. Though the imperial power was sunk so low, the emperor was allowed to confer the post of K√°zi of the city on K√°zi R√ªkn-ul-Hak Kh√°n who arrived at √Åhmed√°b√°d and assumed office. ;Failure of an Attempt on Cambay, 1753 At the close of the year Shripatr√°v, who was anxious to acquire Cambay, marched against Mom√≠n Kh√°n. After two doubtful battles in which the Mar√°th√°s gained no advantage, it was agreed that Mom√≠n Kh√°n should pay a sum of Rupees 7000, and Shripatr√°v departed from √Åhmed√°b√°d early in 1754. The Kolis. When the Kolis heard of the ill success of the Mar√°th√°s at Cambay, they revolted and R√°ghoshankar was sent to subdue them. In an engagement near Luh√°ra in Bahyal in the G√°ikw√°r's territory about eighteen miles east of √Åhmed√°b√°d, R√°ghoshankar scattered the Kolis, but they again collected and forced the Mar√°th√°s to retire. At this time Shetuji and Shankarji returned from Sorath, where they had performed the pilgrimage to Dwarka. Shetuji was sent to the Bh√≠l district against the Kolis. He was unsuccessful, and was so ashamed of his failure that he returned to the Dakhan and Dandu D√°t√°tri was appointed in his place. In this year died Nek √Ålam Kh√°n II, governor of Broach. He was succeeded by his brother Khertalab Kh√°n who expelled his nephew H√°mid Beg, son of Nek √Ålam Kh√°n. H√°mid Beg took refuge in Surat. At B√°l√°sinor a dispute arose between Sher Kh√°n B√°bi and a body of Arab mercenaries who took possession of a hill, but in the end came to terms. ;Mar√°th√°s Attack Cambay, 1754 With the Peshwa's permission his deputy Bhagvantr√°v marched on Cambay. But Varajl√°l, Mom√≠n Kh√°n's steward, who was then at Poona, sent word to his master, who prepared himself against any emergency. When Bhagvantr√°v arrived at Cambay he showed no hostile intentions and was well received by Mom√≠n Kh√°n. Subsequently, a letter from Bhagvantr√°v to S√°lim Jam√°d√°r at √Åhmed√°b√°d ordering him to march against Cambay fell into Mom√≠n Kh√°n's hands. He at once surrounded Bhagvantr√°v's house and made him prisoner. When the Peshwa heard that Bhagvantr√°v had been captured, he ordered Ganesh √Åpa, governor of Jambusar, as well as the governors of V√≠ramg√°m, Dhandhuka, and other places to march at once upon Cambay. They went and besieged the town for three months, but without success. Eventually Shripatr√°v, the Peshwa's deputy, sent the author of the MirƒÉt-i-√Åhmedi to negotiate, and it was agreed that Bhagvantr√°v should be released and that no alteration should be made in the position of Mom√≠n Kh√°n. Shortly afterwards Shripatr√°v was recalled by the Peshwa and his place supplied by an officer of the name of R√°gho. About this time Khertalab Kh√°n, governor of Broach, died, and quarrels arose regarding the succession. Ultimately Hamid Beg, nephew of Khertalab Kh√°n, obtained the post, and he afterwards received an imperial order confirming him as governor, and bestowing on him the title of Nekn√°m Kh√°n Bah√°dur. At Delhi, during 1754, the emperor Ahmad Shah Bahadur was deposed, and √Çz√≠z-ud-d√≠n, son of Jah√°nd√°r Sh√°h, was raised to the throne with the title of Alamgir II.

Strayer, which stars Claire Windsor, Johnny Mack Brown, and Anita Louise. The screenplay was written by Gordon Morris and Anthony Coldeway, was produced by Invincible Pictures and was released by Chesterfield Motion Pictures on January 22, 1934. Plot When he is spurned by his fianc√©, Ann Clement, at his college graduation, young doctor Adam Blythe begins drinking heavily. Ann marries the wealthy Jerry Grattan. Adam conducts surgery while under the influence, and loses his patient. Disgraced, he becomes a small-town veterinarian, unable to practice medicine. After seventeen years, Adam runs into an old schoolmate, Morton Talbot, who although he flunked out of college, is now quite wealthy. Hearing Adam's story, he empathizes with his old friend, and begins to formulate a plan. He convinces Adam to accompany him to the upcoming graduation ceremonies at their old college, Clifton University. When they arrive, Morton hints of the possibility of his making a large bequest to the school of medicine to Dean Todd, the head of the college. It was Todd who had flunked Morton, causing him to leave school. Morton introduces Adam, claiming that he is an eminent surgeon with a flourishing practice in Europe. Meanwhile, Adam meets June Grattan, the 17-year-old daughter of Ann and Jerry. When an opportunity comes up, Morton pushes Todd to allow Adam to perform a very delicate piece of surgery. At first, Adam does not want to, but allows himself to be convinced to perform the surgery, which he does flawlessly. Impressed, Dean Todd offers Adam the position as head of the new research wing of the medical school, which is to be built with funds donated by Morton. June is equally impressed, and she and Adam fall in love. When her parents find out about their blossoming relationship, Ann is consumed by jealousy, which in turn fuels Jerry's jealousy. He approaches Adam and threatens to tell June that Adam is her father, unless Adam leaves her alone. At a banquet that evening, however, Adam is consumed by guilt over the deception he and Morton have perpetrated. In front of the entire audience, he lets them all know the truth about his history. Everyone is in a state of shock, but June lets him know that it doesn't change her feelings for him. Adam, seeing the hopelessness of their relationship, convinces June that he is not the man for her, and that she should return to her fianc√©. After she leaves, Ann arrives prepared to let him know she still has feelings for him. Jerry, blind with jealousy, has followed Ann, and when he sees her with Adam, takes out a gun and fires at her. Adam jumps in front of the bullet. As he lays dying, he asks Jerry for the gun, which he wipes clean of fingerprints. Then, just before his death, he tells Ann and Jerry to say that he committed suicide. Morton dedicates the new research center to Adam's memory.

The power output of the hydro scheme is 330 kW with an annual output of 1,400 MWh and is the fourth hydro scheme on the river after the opening of similar power plants at Linton near Grassington, and two further downstream from Burley at Pool-in-Wharfedale and Garnett Wharfe at Otley. All of these schemes have been located on sites previously used to generate power from the water flow. History The site was previously used as a water mill from the 1790s up until 1966, when the mill that worked cotton, Greenholme Mill, went out of business. In 2010, a joint venture between Derwent Hydro Power (DHP) and Trade Link Solutions (TLS), developed a new turbine on the site to generate electricity from the water passing through the old mill race. The old mill race was diverted slightly, but cuts a path east of the River Wharfe whilst the main body of the river curves north east and then around to the south in a horseshoe shape. The mill race had silted up and had to be cleared before the new turbine plant could generate power. The plant generates enough electricity to power between 300-340 homes per year, from a flow of per second and saves over of carbon dioxide emissions being pumped into the environment each year. The capacity of the plant is 1,400 MWh per year. At the same time as the turbine house was being built, a fish pass was installed to help with the bio-diversity of the river. The plant at Burley is the fourth scheme of its kind to be built on the River Wharfe after Linton Falls re-opened near Grassington and a similar scheme to the one at Burley opened in 2010 at Pool-in-Wharfedale, though the one at Pool has a third of the generating capacity (100 Kwh). A fourth plant was reconditioned at an old papermill at Garnett Wharfe in Otley in 2016 as part of an estate build of 240 homes. Garnett Wharfe has a similar power output to Burley. Whereas other schemes have used Archimedes' screws in a reverse direction (IE the water flowing through downstream turns the screws and generates electricity), the turbine plant at Burley houses a Kaplan Turbine, which means the water flowing through turns two blades and as it does so, it changes pressure. This requires the inward flow to always have a good head of water. Measures have taken to prevent water loss at Burley even though the turbine will not work when there is a low flow of water such as in a dry summer. The plant was opened by Phillip Davies MP in August 2011 and is designed to feed electricity into the National Grid.

At least 23 people were killed and 39 others were injured in the stampede. The incident took place between the Parel railway station and Elphinstone road railway station. Incident On the morning of 29 September 2017, around 10:30 am local time, a stampede erupted on a footbridge at the suburban Elphinstone road railway station in Mumbai which connects two of the city's major suburban lines. Cause The incident occurred during the morning rush hour at Elphinstone road station, when four trains arrived simultaneously at the station. It was further raining at the time and there were already numerous people crammed into the narrow bridge. Someone may have slipped and fell when passengers resumed their travel after the rain, leading to the stampede. A rumour that the pedestrian bridge was collapsing may have caused the passengers to surge forwards to flee. According to a witness, the situation worsened as police and emergency officials did not respond immediately or enforce crowd control measures. At least 23 people died and 39 others were injured in the stampede. According to a hospital's official, most of the people who died suffered from chest compression and haemorrhage due to injuries. Police investigation \\"The overbridge of Elphinstone station was overcrowded and due to rain it got slippery too. This caused panic and resulted in the stampede,\\" said Atul Shrivastav, IG of the Railway Protection Force. A case of Accidental Death (ADR), was registered at the Dadar Police Station. S. Jaykumar, Additional Commissioner of Police (Central Region), Mumbai also stated that overcrowding was a factor. Reactions Piyush Goyal, the Minister of Railways, announced a compensation of ‚Ç®.10 lakh or about $15,200 for the victims. President of India, Ram Nath Kovind expressed grief over the \\"loss of lives in the stampede in Mumbai\\". Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to \\"all those who have lost their lives due to the stampede in Mumbai\\", in a tweet. . Venkaiah Naidu, the Vice President; Devendra Fadnavis, Chief Minister of Maharashtra; Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of Bengal and opposition leader Rahul Gandhi also expressed condolences over the deaths caused by the stampede. Shiv Sena called the stampede \\"a public massacre of the people by the government\\". Many Indians took to social media and called out the government for spending on projects such as a new bullet train from Mumbai to Ahmedabad in Gujarat, instead of focusing on basic infrastructure. Many media reports criticised the infrastructure in the station and reported the incident as a tragedy which was waiting to happen. MNS chief Raj Thackeray warned PM that he would not allow a single brick to be placed for the bullet train in Mumbai, until the infrastructure of local railways was made better. In the aftermath, railway minister Piyush Goyal said that the government has ordered a probe into the incident. He also ordered a safety and capacity audit of all foot over-bridges at suburban stations across Mumbai. In February 2018, the Indian Army opened three new Bailey bridge footbridges at Elphinstone Road, Currey Road and Ambivli. These were erected quickly, in response to the stampede.

Ballantine (1883‚Äì1960) was a 20th-century American lawyer, tax specialist, who became the first solicitor of the Internal Revenue Service and Undersecretary of the Treasury under U.S. President Herbert Hoover and later partner in what became the Dewey Ballantine law firm. Background Austin Hall, Harvard Law School, which Ballantine attended in the 1900s Arthur Atwood Ballantine was born in 1883. His father was William Ballantine, president of Oberlin College. In 1904, he obtained a BA from Harvard University and in 1907 an LLB from Harvard Law School. Career IRS, of which Ballantine was the first solicitor Ballantine was an expert in corporate income taxes. In 1917, he joined a committee to advise the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on legal questions arising from the new war revenue laws. He focused on the excess profits tax of October 1917. In 1918, he became Solicitor of the Internal Revenue Service and then served as Undersecretary. In 1919, Ballantine joined Root, Clark & Bird. In 1925, the firm added his name to its name (Root, Clark, Howland & Ballantine): Ballantine headed a growing tax division. In 1927, Ballantine became advisor to the Treasury as well as the Joint Committee of Congress on Internal Revenue Taxation. By the 1930s, the firm was known as Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine. Ballantine and Buckner ran the firm throughout the 1920s and 1930s. During the Great Depression, the firm flourished by moving away from its traditional focus on litigation and began to focus on bankruptcy and reorganizations and New Deal regulations. The firm also built up a corporate practice, serving clients such as AT&T; and Standard Oil. Overall, the firm expanded from eight (8) to 74 associates and opened a second office in Washington, D.C. Both Henry Friendly and John Marshall Harlan II worked at the firm during this period. In 1931, the offices of Root, Clark, Buckner & Ballantine were at 31 Nassau Street (Manhattan) in Manhattan. Ballantine was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Practicing Law Institute, Columbia Teachers College, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the Harvard University Board of Overseers. From 1947 to 1952 and again from 1955 to 1958, he had a strong association with the Practicing Law Institute and may have lectured there or served on a board there. In 1955, Governor Thomas E. Dewey joined the firm as a partner after leaving office and the firm, then called Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood, became Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood. (In 1990, the firm shortened the name to Dewey Ballantine. Later, it adopted the limited liability partnership form, becoming Dewey Ballantine LLP. The firm later merged again to form Dewey & LeBoeuf.) Hiss Case involvement rightAlger Hiss ca. 1950, with whom Ballatine had several connections, including the CEIP. Ballantine was involved in the Hiss Case in several ways, starting with the fact that at the time he was a member of the board of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, of which Alger Hiss was president. On August 31, 1948, Hiss wrote to his lifelong friend and fellow Harvard lawyer William L. Marbury, Jr.: > I am planning a suit for libel or defamation...

Scala opened on 31 December 1969 with a screening of The Undefeated (1969), a US Western starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson. It closed on 5 July 2020, showing, as its last film, Cinema Paradiso. The Scala, called \\"...the finest movie theater left in Southeast Asia\\" was the last stand-alone cinema in Bangkok, down from roughly 140 movie houses in the 1950s and 1960s.  History  Scala, in the Siam Square shopping area, was one of the Apex group of cinemas which included Siam Cinema, Lido Cinema, and Scala. The 800-seat Siam Cinema opened on 15 December 1966 with The Battle of the Bulge as its first screening. Siam burnt down during the 2010 Thai political protests. In 1968, the Apex Group built the 1000-seat Lido Cinema. It closed its doors when its lease expired in May 2018, but was reopened in 2019 as a performing arts venue, Lido Connect. The Scala was the last remaining standalone single-screen cinema in Bangkok, offering film aficionados a retro film-going experience. The president of Apex attributed Scala's closing to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and changing consumer preferences. Its last screening was shown amid rumours that the building will be demolished to make way for new development. Designed by architect Chira Silpakanok, the building is late-Modernist in design with interior decorations in the Art Deco style. A grand staircase dominated the interior, illuminated by a huge Italian chandelier. The cinema received the ASA Architectural Conservation Award in 2012. The building's future is uncertain as Chulalongkorn University, owners of the property, searches for a new tenant. The Scala hosted film festivals such as the Bangkok International Film Festival, the Silent Film Festival, and was itself the subject of a documentary film shown at the Salaya International Documentary Film Festival in 2016. Final films On Scala's last day, four movies curated by the Thai Film Archive were shown. They included two Italian classics by Michelangelo Antonioni: Blowup at noon; followed by a double-bill of Thai documentaries The Scala, and Phantom of Illumination, which pay homage to standalone movie theaters at 15:00; and Antonioni's Cinema Paradiso, Scala's last film, at 18:00. Death of the Thai grand cinema In the heyday of big screen cinema, there were 700 stand-alone cinemas in Thailand, according to cinema historian Philip Jablon. One hundred-forty of them were in Bangkok alone. By 2019, only three remained in Thailand: the Scala in Bangkok, Det Udom Mini Theatre in Ubon Ratchathani, and Chum Phae Cineplex in Khon Kaen. Jablon observes that, \\"What's surprising is that it went from so many to [almost] zero,\\" he said. \\"I can't think of anywhere else that this kind of culture, technology and buildings have completely disappeared. All over the world, stand-alone movie theatres have declined. But I don't know anywhere it declined to the point of being extinct, except Thailand. It's funny because people still go to the movies in Thailand. Thailand has a strong film industry and also imports a lot of movies. Yet, the old-fashioned way of watching a movie has completely died.\\" Writer Sonthaya Subyen, together with his colleague Morimart Raden-Ahmad, set out to capture what remains of Thailand's cinemas for their 2014 book, Once Upon a Celluloid Planet: Where Cinema Ruled. \\"Stand-alone theaters used to be city landmarks and the only mass entertainment place for people of all ages,\\" he observed. According to the authors, stand-alone theaters flourished in Thailand between the 1950s and the 1970s before seeing attendance decline in the 1980s with the coming of VHS tapes. \\"Similar to attending temple fairs, locals dressed up to go to stand- alone theaters\\". Usually found in city centers near central markets, theaters became community gathering points. \\"They supported one another, the theater and the community.\\" Notes :1.

The Buddha is carved out of the cliff face of a stone hill that lies to the north east of Rongxian and the Rongxi River in the eastern part of Sichuan province in China. Standing 414 metres above sea level, the stone sculpture overlooks the town of Rongxian below its feet. After the Leshan Giant Buddha, it is the second tallest pre-modern statue. The Temple is located on the Dafo Road, Rongxian, Zigong Shi, Sichuan Sheng, China. D√†f√≥ (Â§ß‰Ωõ) in Chinese means Big Buddha. The nearest city is Zigong. History Rongxian Giant Buddha in 1910 Construction was started in around 817, by Chinese monks. A sophisticated drainage system was incorporated into the Rongxian Giant Buddha when it was built, still in working order; it includes drainage pipes carved into various places on the body, to carry away the water after the rains so as to reduce weathering. When the Giant Buddha was carved, a huge ten story wood structure, with five roofs was built to shelter it from the rain and sun. Unusually this structure is still in place. The statue had been known about by westerners from as far back as the late 1870s when Edward Colborne Baber (a British traveller visiting Jah-ding and Mount Omei (Leshan)) had been told of its existence by an unknown Russian traveller. However it was not until 1910 that Roger Sprague (an American University Graduate) visited it. He found the figure to be on the same plan as the Buddha at Leshan. The upper half of the hill was sandstone cliff into which a niche 50 feet broad had been cut, \\"leaving a central core of stone carved into a figure seated in European style, not cross legged as Buddha is so often represented. There he sits, grimly gazing out at the tiled roof of the city which lies before him\\". Sprague was also to see a Temple in Yong- hien, the city below the Great Buddha, where he noticed two chimneys which disproved the theory that \\"in China proper chimneys are unknown\\". Degradation The Rongxian Buddha has been affected by the pollution emanating from the unbridled development in the region. According to Xinhua news agency, the Leshan Giant Buddha and many Chinese natural and cultural heritage sites in the region have seen degradations from weathering, air pollution, and swarms of tourists. The government has promised restoration work.Reuters, article Dimensions At tall, the statue depicts a seated Maitreya Buddha with his hands resting on his knees. His body is 36.67 metres high, the head 8.76 metres, and his shoulders are 12.67 metres wide The knees 12 metres high, and the feet 3.5 metres wide. There is a local saying: \\"The mountain is a Buddha and the Buddha is a mountain\\". The Temple covers an area of about 80,000 square metres, the temple and housing enclosing the Buddha is an area of 2000 square metres.

The identities of the purported clients to whom she was showing the property ‚Äì and who are the prime suspects in her murder ‚Äì remain unknown. As of 2020, her murder remains unsolved.  Background and events leading up to the murder  Lindsay Buziak was born on November 2, 1983, to Jeff Buziak and Evelyn Buziak (n√©e Reitmayer). She had one sister, Sara. In 2008, 24-year-old Lindsay was an ambitious Victoria real estate agent who had made a promising start to her career and was described by her family, friends, and colleagues as being popular and caring. Her boyfriend, Jason Zailo, is part of a prominent and wealthy family that owns a successful real estate business. In late January 2008, Lindsay Buziak received a call from a woman who told Lindsay that she and her husband were looking urgently for a home to buy, with a budget of $1 million. According to Lindsay, the caller had a foreign accent that she could not place, sounding \\"a bit Spanish but not really\\". Lindsay believed that the caller could have been faking an accent in order to conceal her identity. Unnerved by the nature of the call, Lindsay asked the caller how she had gotten her personal cell phone number, as she was a relatively junior employee. The caller said that a previous client of Lindsay's had passed it on to her. Lindsay told her boyfriend, Jason Zailo, and her father, Jeff Buziak, about the call and revealed her concerns. Jason encouraged Lindsay to take on the client because of the high commission she would get from the sale, and to reassure her, Jason offered to be outside the property in his car in case anything went wrong. Lindsay found a suitable property and made an appointment with the client to view it at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, February 2, 2008.  Day of the murder  On Saturday, February 2, 2008, Lindsay and Jason ate a late lunch at a restaurant, paying the bill at 4:24 p.m. They left separately in their own vehicles. It is believed that Lindsay went home to change clothes before the viewing. Jason travelled to an auto shop to pick up a colleague. Jason was running late, and CCTV at the auto shop showed him and his colleague leaving at 5:30 p.m. Jason and Lindsay had exchanged several text messages and Lindsay was aware that Jason would be late. The street on which the house is located, De Sousa Place, is a small cul-de-sac containing four houses. Number 1702 is at the outer end of the cul-de-sac, on the intersection of De Sousa Place and a main thoroughfare, Torquay Drive. The side of the property and the fence of the back garden run parallel to Torquay Drive. Despite the client telling Lindsay that she would come alone, a couple turned up for the viewing. At 5:30 p.m., two witnesses saw a 6-foot-tall Caucasian man with dark hair and a blonde-haired woman aged between 35 and 45 wearing a distinctively patterned dress walking up the cul-de-sac. The witnesses then saw Lindsay shake hands with the couple, and from the body language of their greeting it appeared that she had never met them before. The three of them then entered the house. Jason and his colleague arrived at the cul-de-sac at about 5:40 p.m. As they were driving up to the property, he saw a man and a woman coming out of the front door; upon seeing him, they immediately turned around and went back inside the house. Jason parked outside the property for about 10 minutes. He then decided to drive back out to Torquay Drive and park there, as he did not want to be \\"a nosey, interfering boyfriend\\". After waiting another 10 minutes parked on Torquay Drive, Jason texted Lindsay to ask if she was OK. Lindsay never opened this message. After twenty minutes had passed since Jason had arrived and seen the couple go back into the house, Jason went to the front door and found it locked when he tried to open it. Through the mottled glass on the front door, he saw Lindsay's shoes in the entrance hall, but there was no sign of movement and no one answered his repeated knocks at the door. At this point, he called 911. While Jason was on the line with the operator, his colleague found a gap in the fence in the back garden, entered the garden and saw that the back patio door was wide open. He called out to Jason, who told the operator that they were going into the house. Jason then hung up. Jason's colleague came through the main level of the home to unlock the front door to let Jason in. Jason immediately ran upstairs and found Lindsay lying in a pool of blood in the master bedroom. Jason called 911 a second time and the emergency services arrived soon after. Lindsay was pronounced dead when the paramedics arrived. She had been stabbed multiple times. There were no defensive wounds, indicating that she had probably been initially stabbed from behind and had no inkling of what was about to happen. None of Lindsay's possessions had been stolen and she had not been sexually assaulted.  Investigation  Jason and his colleague were taken into custody but were released without charge after their version of events was verified and the timestamped surveillance footage from the auto shop proved that they could not have committed the murder. According to the Saanich Police Department, Jason has been interviewed several times over the years and has always cooperated with the police. He has also passed a polygraph test. However, he has always refused to provide a DNA sample. Due to the complete lack of DNA, fingerprints or any other physical evidence at the scene, it is believed that the murder was a well-organized professional hit carried out by people who had killed before. The police are satisfied that the killers were leaving through the front door when Jason drove up to the property, and that they then fled through the back door, leaving the back patio door open and passing through the fence and back to a vehicle, which was presumably parked somewhere on or near Torquay Drive. This is consistent with the witness statements of the unknown couple walking (rather than driving) up the cul-de-sac, and the fact that all the vehicles on the cul-de-sac once the police arrived were accounted for. The cell phone used by the unknown woman to call Lindsay was purchased in Vancouver several months before the murder and had never been used until that call was made. It was activated under the name of Paulo Rodriguez, which authorities believe is a fake name. It was registered to a legitimate address in Vancouver, which is a business address, but it is believed that the business has no connection with the case and that its address was simply chosen at random. The phone was deactivated soon after the murder and has not been used since. Cell phone tower \\"pings\\" show that the phone travelled on the ferry from Vancouver the day before the murder. Authorities believe the phone was used for the sole purpose of the murder and was discarded afterwards. This supports their theory that the murder was planned. The family of Jason Zailo were investigated due to their connections with the cul-de-sac. De Sousa Court is named after developer Joe De Sousa, a friend and business associate of Shirley Zailo, Jason's mother. Part of the cul-de-sac was still under construction at the time of the murder, and De Sousa himself was at the location an hour before the murder, supervising the construction work. However, the police have stated that no one in the Zailo family is a suspect. In September of 2010, NBC aired a Dateline episode, \\"Dream House Murder.\\" The Saanich Police Detectives, Horsley and McColl revealed that in December 2007, about 8 weeks prior to her murder, Lindsay tried to contact the friend of her ex-boyfriend while on a visit to Calgary. On January 22, 2008, the largest drug bust in Alberta's history took place and the friend was arrested as being a major participant in the illegal drug trafficking operation. It was speculated that Lindsay's murder may have been ordered by a drug cartel because she was believed to be a police informant. The detectives investigated the possibility but quickly ruled it out as a motive because she was not an informant and the personal nature of her murder did not fit a hired killer's method of operation. Crime scene investigator Yolanda McClary and veteran Homicide Detective Dwayne Stanton both agree that Lindsay's murder was not a contracted murder related to a drug cartel; it was brutal but too amateurish. Both seasoned investigators stated that they do believe that Lindsay's murder was very personal and planned by someone very close to her; someone who had access to inside information from the Re/Max office where she worked. Speculation regarding another drug bust related to this group of people was also investigated as a link to Lindsay's murder. Jasmohan Singh Bains' phone had been tapped because of his high level of involvement in the trafficking and sale of illegal narcotics in British Columbia and Alberta. During the wire taps, law enforcement uncovered information that led to the BC Legislature Raids in 2003. Lindsay's and her boyfriend's phones at the time were also tapped because of his association with Jasmohan. Although this theory was interesting, it was quickly dismissed because Lindsay was never known to be involved in drug use or trafficking and was not on the witness list released to the defense during the trial.  Later events  Later in 2008, a close friend of Lindsay's, called Nikki, claimed that she was woken by a telephone call in the middle of the night from an unknown number. As she was half- asleep, she did not register much of what the female caller was saying, but she noticed that the caller had a strange accent that she could not place. She became scared when she remembered that Lindsay had reported that her unidentified client (and possible murderer) had an odd accent that she could not put her finger on, and which she thought may have been fake. Now fully alert, she called the number back but no one picked up. She called repeatedly, \\"20 or 30 times\\", until someone answered. The person on the other end of the line was Shirley Zailo. Nikki asked Shirley why she called her and how she had her number, as they did not know each other. Shirley replied that she meant to call another Nikki, her secretary, and that she didn't know why this Nikki's number was in her contact list but presumed that her son Jason must have added it. Shirley Zailo categorically denies that this event occurred, and it has not been publicly revealed whether Nikki's claim was followed up by the authorities. In February of each year, Lindsay's father Jeff leads an annual walk in remembrance of Lindsay and to keep her case in the public eye. In August 2017, a public message was posted on the investigative website run by Jeff Buziak. The message, which contained misspellings throughout, stated: \\"I killed Lindsey [sic] and stupid cops will never prove it.\\"  See also  * List of unsolved murders * Suzy Lamplugh, a British estate agent who disappeared during a scheduled property viewing in London.

Williams (1869 - 1958) was a career officer in the United States Army and served as the 12th Chief of Ordnance for the U.S. Army Ordnance Corps.  Early life  Clarence Charles Williams was born in Georgia on November 8, 1869 and graduated fourth in the class of 1894 from West Point as a Second Lieutenant in the Artillery branch.  Military career  Following initial assignments at Fort McHenry, Maryland, and Fort Monroe, Virginia, he served in the Philippines during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Following his transfer to the Ordnance Corps as a First Lieutenant in October 1898, Williams spent a short time at Rock Island Arsenal and, then, inspected gunpowder for three years at the DuPont Powder Works in Wilmington, Delaware. As a Captain, he spent the period from August 1902 until April 1904 as an assistant to Brigadier General William Crozier, the Army's Chief of Ordnance in Washington. Several years at Rock Island Arsenal followed, and then he spent two years as Inspector of Ordnance at the Bethlehem Steel Plant in Eastern Pennsylvania. As a Major, Williams served four years from December 1907 until January 1912 as a member of the Joint Army-Navy Board to Formulate Specifications for Gun Forgings, followed by six months in 1912 inspecting ordnance materiel in England. Returning to the United States as the commanding officer at Watertown Arsenal, he again traveled to Europe at the end of 1914 as American Military Observer with the German Army for six months. Now, a Lieutenant Colonel, he again took up duties with the Joint Gun Forgings Board from May 1915 until June 1916. Following eight months as the Ordnance Officer for the Southern Department of the Army during the mobilization of Regular Army and National Guard units for the Punitive Expedition, he was called to Washington at the end of February 1917, to become Assistant Chief of Ordnance. With American entry into World War I in April 1917, he traveled to France as the Chief Ordnance Officer for the American Expeditionary Forces. Williams spent eleven months there, during which time he was advanced two grades to the rank of Brigadier General. On April 30, 1918, Williams became the acting Chief of Ordnance, while the current Chief of Ordnance Major General William Crozier was on special duty for President Woodrow Wilson. On July 16, 1918, he was promoted to Major General and official appointed as the 12th Chief of Ordnance, a post he would hold until 1930. During the closing months of World War I, he improved the organization of the Ordnance Department to increase efficiency and decentralize the procurement process to avoid delays. In contrast with the control that the Ordnance Department had over the development and utilization of weapons prior to World War I, he strongly believed that the combat arms should help determine the kinds of weapons they wanted to use in future conflicts. His postwar reorganization of the Ordnance Department realigned responsibilities into a logical scheme which served as the pattern for Ordnance Department operations until American entry into World War II. Williams encouraged planning for industrial mobilization in a period when budgets were comparatively small and placed considerable emphasis on the partnership between the arsenals and industry.

He was later awarded the Croix de Guerre 1939‚Äì1945 and was made an officer of the Legion of Honour. At the start of the German occupation of France Roland Laudenbach co-edited the literary review Pr√©texte with Jean Turlais and Fran√ßois Sentein, and was associated with the theater company \\"Le Rideau des jeunes\\" led by Pierre Franck, whom he had met through Jean Cocteau. Pr√©texte was replaced by Cahiers de la g√©n√©ration in 1941, and its team became the core of the Cahiers fran√ßais published by the Vichy youth organization. The Cahiers fran√ßais attracted nonconformists of the 1930s such as Louis Salleron, Jean de Fabr√®gues, Ren√© Vincent and Pierre Andreu, and followers of Charles Maurras such as Raoul Girardet, Antoine Blondin and Jean Turlais.

Coke is an essential fuel and reactant in the blast furnace process for primary steelmaking. The demand for metallurgical coal is highly coupled to the demand for steel. Primary steelmaking companies often have a division that produces coal for coking, to ensure a stable and low-cost supply.Reed Moyer, Competition in the Midwestern Coal Industry, Harvard University Press, 1964 , page 56, pages 85-86 Raw coke The original blast furnaces at Blists Hill, Madeley Metallurgical coal is low in ash, moisture, sulfur and phosphorus content, and its rank is usually bituminous. Some grades of anthracite coal are used for sintering, pulverized coal injection, direct blast furnace charge, pelletizing, and in production of ferro-alloys, silicon- manganese, calcium-carbide and silicon-carbide. Metallurgical coal produces strong, low-density coke when it is heated in a low-oxygen environment. On heating, the coal softens, and volatile components evaporate and escape through pores in the mass. During coking, the material swells and increases in volume. The coking ability of coal is related to its physical properties such as its rank, but laboratory testing is required to completely evaluate the coking ability of a coal. The strength and density of coke are particularly important when it is used in a blast furnace, as the coke supports part of the ore and flux burden inside the furnace. Metallurgical coal contrasts with thermal coal, which does not produce coke when heated. Because of their different end-uses, prices for the two types of coal are usually quite different. Metallurgical coal comes mainly from Canada, the United States, and Australia. In the United States, the electric power sector used \\"93% of total U.S. coal consumption between 2007 and 2018\\"; only 7% of the total was metallurgical coal and coal for other uses such as heating.  Caking ability  The suitability of coal for conversion to coke is also referred to as the caking ability.

This lordship was created after the Viscounty of L√©on was divided into a viscounty and the lordship at the end of the 12th century. The lordship of L√©on was a large fief made of about sixty parishes and '. The estates of the lordship are located around the valley of the √âlorn river, the town of Landerneau and the castle of La Roche-Maurice. The lordship was initially held by the junior branch of the Viscounts of L√©on, which was founded by Harvey I. After Harvey VIII died without issue, the fief was inherited by the Viscounts of Rohan. In the middle of the 16th century the fief became known as \\"Pincipality of L√©on\\". Landerneau, Landivisiau, Daoulas, Coat-M√©al, Penz√© and La Roche-Maurice were the seats of the jurisdictions of this huge Breton lordship.  History  In the 12th century, the Viscounts of L√©on rebelled against Henry II of England in order to escape Plantagenet's domination in the Duchy of Brittany. In 1179, after the death of Guihomar IV, who had submitted to the Ducal power not long before, Henry II of England confiscated the L√©on estates. Following the confiscation of Morlaix by Duke Geoffrey Plantagenet, Guihomar IV's two sons Guihomar V et Harvey recovered their inheritance. Guihomar V got the castellanies of Lesneven, Brest, Saint-Renan and Le Conquet as well as the title of Viscount. Harvey got the estates of Landerneau and Daoudour, as well as the lordship of Coat-M√©al. Being a juveigneur, i.e. a younger son endowed with an estate, Herv√© had to content himself with the title of Lord of L√©on and founded the junior branch of the House of L√©on, which managed to keep his fief of La Roche-Maurice for 8 generations (from Harvey I to Harvey VIII).

This part of the inheritance went to Louis of Valois, Count of Chartres, who had obtained the estate of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thymerais. When King Philip VI died childless in 1329, he gave his brother Charles II of Valois, Count of Alen√ßon and Perche, a part of their brother's inheritance, and gave him in a charter dated May 1335 the lands of Ch√¢teauneuf-en-Thimerais, Senonches and Champrond among others. * Harvey V: his son, died in 1304 * Harvey VI: his son, died in 1337, married Joan of Montmorency. * Harvey VII: his son, died in 1344, married Margaret of Avaugour; Lord of Noyon-sur- Andelle. * Harvey VIII: his son, born in 1341, died in 1363. His birth certificate has been conserved: \\"In the Lord's year 1341, the Sunday after the transfer of Saint Martin, during the night, about two hours before sunrise, was born in La Roche-Morice, Harvey of L√©on from parents belonging of the highest nobility. His father was My Lord Harvey of L√©on and his mother was My Lady Margaret of Avaugour (‚Ä¶)\\". During the War of the Breton Succession which started in 1341, the Lords of L√©on supported Charles of Blois partly because of their links with the House of Avaugour. Harvey VII of L√©on was captured by the English in 1342 and spent two years imprisoned in the Tower of London. He died in 1344 soon after he was released. The fief of La Roche-Maurice was inherited by his son Harvey VIII of L√©on, then aged 3. A note in the Lords of L√©on's Bible indicates that Harvey VIII was born in La Roche-Maurice in 1341. During the War of the Breton Succession, the situation became confused. The last Lord of L√©on died without issue in 1363. The fief was inherited by John I, Viscount of Rohan through his marriage with Joan of L√©on, Harvey VIII's sister.La Roche-Maurice et Landerneau , Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique du Finist√®re, May 2011 In 1363, Harvey VIII died without issue: the Lordship of L√©on was inherited by his sister Joan, wife of John I of Rohan.The Viscounts of Rohan sometimes styled themselves Viscounts of L√©on The Lordship became part of the estates held by the Rohans.

She is also remembered for becoming an active campaigner for women's suffrage in the early 20th century. Early life and education Born on 26 July 1858 in Ebeltoft, Anna Sophie von der Hude was the daughter of Sophus Waldemar von der Hude and Johanne Larentine Elisabeth Tulinius. She was raised together with her four siblings in Roskilde. After working for a time as a schoolteacher, she moved to Copenhagen in 1878 to complete her secondary schooling. After earning her matriculation certificate in 1882, she studied at Copenhagen University. In 1887, she became the first woman to graduate in history. The following year, she was awarded the university's gold medal for her dissertation on the origins of feudalism, En Fremstilling og Kritik af de nyere Opfattelser af Sp√∏rgsmaalet om Lensv√¶snets Opkomst. In 1893, she became the first woman to receive a Dr.phil for her work on the Danehof medieval parliament titled Danehoffet og dets Plads i Danmarks Statsforfatning. Rape incident While Hude was studying, in 1879 she became acquainted with C.J. Leerbeck, the family doctor of her uncle with whom she was staying. A few months later, Leerbeck raped her. After first attempting suicide, she shot him on an open street. He survived but later hanged himself in the cell where he was being held after Hude explained the reason for her action. The case was widely publicized, leading to Hude's release after only five months in prison. Career and later life Hude was the first woman to be employed by the Danish National Archives where she worked from 1889 to 1910. While there, she collaborated with Kristian Erslev and on Repertorium diplomaticum Regni danici medi√¶valis. From 1884, Hede became increasingly active in the cause for women's rights, becoming a member of the Danish Women's Society. In 1904, she became active in campaigning for women's suffrage, cofounding the Political Women's Association (Politisk Kvindeforening) which she headed as the first president in 1905. The association was the basis for Landsforbundet for Kvinders Valgret, founded in 1907. From 1908, she lost interest in women's rights, preferring to devote her time to spiritism. In 1913, she published The Evidence of Communication with the Dead in English, since reprinted. Anna Hude died in Copenhagen on 9 August 1934.

Life and career Gombocz was born in √ñdenburg/Sopron, and spent his early years there, where his father was a professor at an evangelical college. He studied philology, which also included Romance languages, under the linguists Josef Szinnyei, August Ph. Becker and also Zsigmund Simonyi at Budapest University, and through them absorbed the principles of the Junggrammatiker. Szinnyei's diplomacy is said to have been decisive in influencing Gombocz's decision to concentrate on languages related to Hungary's historic roots. he obtained his doctorate in 1900. He studied abroad, under the Jesuit linguist Jean-Pierre Rousselot at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, in Germany over 1903/4 in Leipzig where he came under the influence of Hermann Paul and Wilhelm Wundt, and in Finland where he mastered Finnish. He took up appointments successively thereafter as Professor of Finno-Ugric languages at Kolozsv√°r and Szeged, and was appointed chair of the subject in Budapest in 1921, where he rose to become rector in 1927 of the most prestigious institution of learning in his country, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University. Aside from writing a key modern text on Hungarian, An Outline of a Historical Hungarian Grammnar, Gombocz tackled one of the most recondite problems of his discipline the reconstruction of the ancient vowel and vowel-ablaut system of proto-Finno-Ugrian, which, together with the work of his Finnish colleague Eemil Nestor Set√§l√§, put Finno-Ugrian phonology on a firm scientific basis. Together with his friend and colleague Melich J√°nos, Gombocz compiled a comprehensive etymological dictionary of Hungarian, the first scientific work of its kind for one of the Finno-Ugrian languages. Gombocz also mastered Turkology and made fundamental contributions to the topic, writing important papers on the analysis of Turkic loan-words into Hungarian. Death and tributes Gombocz died of a seizure during a faculty meeting, at the early age of 58, and was mourned by his peers as one of the two outstanding altmeister of Finno-Ugric studies of his time, the other being Set√§l√§, who had died earlier in February, the same year.
