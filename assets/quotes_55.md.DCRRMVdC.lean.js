Kish village surrounded by mountains  History According to Movses Kaghankatvatsi, in the 1st century A.D. St. Elishe, a disciple of Thaddeus of Edessa, arrived to a place called Gis, where he built a church and recited a liturgy. The church became the \\"spiritual center and the place of enlightenment of people of the East\\". On his way from Gis St. Elishe was killed near the pagan altar in small Zerguni valley by unknown people.Movses Kaghankatvatsi. History of Albania. Book 1, Chapter VI According to the Baku eparchy of the Russian Orthodox Church, the location of Gis mentioned by Movses Kaghankatvatsi is identified with the present-day Kish, located on the left bank of river Kura, in Shaki district of Azerbaijan.Official website of Baku eparchy of Russian Orthodox Church. Architectural heritage of Caucasian Albania The Church of Kish was the first church built in Caucasian Albania and in the Caucasus.Interview with Russian Orthodox Baku and Caspian Bishop Alexander However, according to Armenian commentator Karapetian, the geographical position of Kish does not seem to match that described by Kaghankatvatsi. Karapetian believes that they have identified Gis as the village of Bomen / Bum 60 km to the south-east of Kish, in Gabala district, Uti (Utik) province.KISH_eng According to Georgian historiography, in the 10th century, the population of Kish converted to the Georgian Orthodox Church. Known at the time as part of Sourb Asvatzatzin Church, Kish turned into a residence of Georgian bishop, functioning till 17th century.Samvel Karapetian, \\"Research on Armenian Architecture\\", Online Version The population of Kish converted to Islam in 1720s; however, when Russia later took possession of the region, some villagers returned to Christian faith. In 1836, the Albanian church, along with all active churches in this region that were not Georgian or Russian, was incorporated into the Armenian Apostolic Church, and the Church of Kish was refounded in 1860s and became a place of pilgrimage due to the belief that it was associated with St. Elishe (Yegishe).

A variety of views circulated about the racial identity of the Egyptians and the source of their culture.Edith Sanders: The Hamitic hypothesis: its origin and functions in time perspective, The Journal of African History, Vol. 10, No. 4 (1969), pp. 521‚Äì532 Some scholars argued that ancient Egyptian culture was influenced by other Afroasiatic-speaking populations in North Africa or the Middle East, while others pointed to influences from various Nubian groups or populations in Europe. In more recent times some writers continued to challenge the mainstream view, some focusing on questioning the race of specific notable individuals such as the king represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, native Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun, Egyptian Queen Tiye, and Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII. Mainstream scholars reject the notion that Egypt was a white or black civilization; they maintain that, despite the phenotypic diversity of Ancient and present-day Egyptians, applying modern notions of black or white races to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. In addition, scholars reject the notion, implicit in the notion of a black or white Egypt hypothesis, that Ancient Egypt was racially homogeneous; instead, skin color varied between the peoples of Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Nubia, who in various eras rose to power in Ancient Egypt. Moreover, \\"Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward the Sudan\\". Within Egyptian history, despite multiple foreign invasions, the demographics were not shifted by large migrations. Origins The earliest examples of disagreement regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians occurred in the work of Europeans and Americans early in the 19th century. One early example of such an attempt was an article published in The New-England Magazine of October 1833, where the authors dispute a claim that \\"Herodotus was given as authority for their being negroes.\\" They point out with reference to tomb paintings: \\"It may be observed that the complexion of the men is invariably red, that of the women yellow; but neither of them can be said to have anything in their physiognomy at all resembling the Negro countenance.\\" In the 18th century, Constantin Fran√ßois de Chasseb≈ìuf, comte de Volney, wrote about the race controversy. In one translation, he wrote \\"The Copts are the proper representatives of the Ancient Egyptians\\" due to their \\"jaundiced and fumed skin, which is neither Greek, Negro nor Arab, their full faces, their puffy eyes, their crushed noses, and their thick lips...the ancient Egyptians were true negroes of the same type as all native born Africans\\". In another translation, Volney said the Sphinx gave him the key to the riddle, \\"seeing that head, typically negro in all its features\\", the Copts were \\"true negroes of the same stock as all the autochthonous peoples of Africa\\" and they \\"after some centuries of mixing...,must have lost the full blackness of its original color.\\" Just a few years later, in 1839, Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion stated in his work Egypte Ancienne that the Egyptians and Nubians are represented in the same manner in tomb paintings and reliefs, further suggesting that: \\"In the Copts of Egypt, we do not find any of the characteristic features of the ancient Egyptian population. The Copts are the result of crossbreeding with all the nations that successfully dominated Egypt. It is wrong to seek in them the principal features of the old race.\\" Also in 1839, Champollion's and Volney's claims were disputed by Jacques Joseph Champollion-Figeac, who blamed the ancients for spreading a false impression of a Negro Egypt, stating \\"the two physical traits of black skin and kinky hair are not enough to stamp a race as negro\\"and \\"the opinion that the ancient population of Egypt belonged to the Negro African race, is an error long accepted as the truth. ... Volney's conclusion as to the Negro origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization is evidently forced and inadmissible.\\" Foster summarized the early 19th century \\"controversy over the ethnicity of the ancient Egyptians\\" as a debate of conflicting theories regarding the Hamites. \\"In ancient times, the Hamites, who developed the civilization of Egypt, were considered Black.\\" Foster describes the 6th century CE curse of Ham theory, which began \\"in the Babylonian Talmud, a collection of oral traditions of the Jews, that the sons of Ham are cursed by being black.\\" Foster said \\"throughout the Middle Ages and to the end of the eighteenth century, the Negro was seen by Europeans as a descendant of Ham.\\" In the early 19th century, \\"after Napolean's expedition to Egypt, the Hamites began to be viewed as having been Caucasians.\\" However, \\"Napolean's scientists concluded that the Egyptians were Negroid.\\" Napoleon's colleagues referenced prior \\"well-known books\\" by Constantin Fran√ßois de Chasseb≈ìuf, comte de Volney and Vivant Denon that described Ancient Egyptians as \\"negroid.\\". Finally, Foster concludes, \\"it was at this point that Egypt became the focus of much scientific and lay interest, the result of which was the appearance of many publications whose sole purpose was to prove that the Egyptians were not Black, and therefore capable of developing such a high civilization.\\" The debate over the race of the ancient Egyptians intensified during the 19th century movement to abolish slavery in the United States, as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people. For example, in 1851, John Campbell directly challenged the claims by Champollion and others regarding the evidence for a black Egypt, asserting \\"There is one great difficulty, and to my mind an insurmountable one, which is that the advocates of the negro civilization of Egypt do not attempt to account for, how this civilization was lost.... Egypt progressed, and why, because it was Caucasian.\\" The arguments regarding the race of the Egyptians became more explicitly tied to the debate over slavery in the United States, as tensions escalated towards the American Civil War. In 1854, Josiah C. Nott with George Glidden set out to prove: \\"that the Caucasian or white, and the Negro races were distinct at a very remote date, and that the Egyptians were Caucasians.\\" Samuel George Morton, a physician and professor of anatomy, concluded that although \\"Negroes were numerous in Egypt, but their social position in ancient times was the same that it now is [in the United States], that of servants and slaves.\\" In the early 20th century, Flinders Petrie, a professor of Egyptology at the University of London, in turn spoke of \\"a black queen\\", Ahmose- Nefertari, who was the \\"divine ancestress of the XVIIIth dynasty\\". He described her physically as \\"the black queen Aohmes Nefertari had an aquiline nose, long and thin, and was of a type not in the least prognathous\\". Position of modern scholarship Modern scholars who have studied ancient Egyptian culture and population history have responded to the controversy over the race of the ancient Egyptians in different ways. At the UNESCO \\"Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script\\" in Cairo in 1974, the Black Hypothesis met with \\"profound\\" disagreement by scholars. Similarly, none of the participants voiced support for an earlier theory where Egyptians were \\"white with a dark, even black, pigmentation.\\" The arguments for all sides are recorded in the UNESCO publication General History of Africa,UNESCO, Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings, (Paris: 1978), pp. 3‚Äì134 with the \\"Origin of the Egyptians\\" chapter being written by the proponent of the black hypothesis Cheikh Anta Diop. At the 1974 UNESCO conference, most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. Since the second half of the 20th century, most anthropologists have rejected the notion of race as having any validity in the study of human biology.\\"American Anthropological Association Statement on Race\\", American Anthropologist Volume 100.

New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1996 Stuart Tyson Smith writes in the 2001 Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Egypt, \\"Any characterization of race of the ancient Egyptians depends on modern cultural definitions, not on scientific study. Thus, by modern American standards it is reasonable to characterize the Egyptians as 'black', while acknowledging the scientific evidence for the physical diversity of Africans.\\"Stuart Tyson Smith,(2001) The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Egypt, Volume 3. Donald Redford, Oxford University Press. p. 27‚Äì28 Frank M.

Snowden Jr., Bernal's 'Blacks' and the Afrocentrists, Black Athena Revisited, p. 122 Barbara Mertz writes in Red Land, Black Land: Daily Life in Ancient Egypt: \\"Egyptian civilization was not Mediterranean or African, Semitic or Hamitic, black or white, but all of them. It was, in short, Egyptian.\\" Kathryn Bard, Professor of Archaeology and Classical Studies, wrote in Ancient Egyptians and the issue of race that \\"Egyptians were the indigenous farmers of the lower Nile valley, neither black nor white as races are conceived of today\\". Nicky Nielsen wrote in Egyptomaniacs: How We Became Obsessed with Ancient Egypt that \\"Ancient Egypt was neither black nor white, and the repeated attempt by advocates of either ideology to seize the ownership of ancient Egypt simply perpetuates an old tradition: one of removing agency and control of their heritage from the modern population living along the banks of the Nile.\\" Frank J. Yurco, an Egyptologist at the Field Museum and the University of Chicago, said: \\"When you talk about Egypt, it's just not right to talk about black or white, That's all just American terminology and it serves American purposes. I can understand and sympathize with the desires of Afro-Americans to affiliate themselves with Egypt. But it isn't that simple [..] To take the terminology here {in the United States} and graft it onto Africa is anthropologically inaccurate\\". Yurco added that \\"We are applying a racial divisiveness to Egypt that they would never have accepted, They would have considered this argument absurd, and that is something we could really learn from.\\" Yurco writes that \\"the peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of North-East Africa are generally regarded as a Nilotic continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types)\\".Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\", 1996, in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, Black Athena Revisited, 1996, The University of North Carolina Press, pp. 62‚Äì100. Barry J. Kemp argues that the black/white argument, though politically understandable, is an oversimplification that hinders an appropriate evaluation of the scientific data on the ancient Egyptians since it does not take into consideration the difficulty in ascertaining complexion from skeletal remains. It also ignores the fact that Africa is inhabited by many other populations besides Bantu-related (\\"Negroid\\") groups. He asserts that in reconstructions of life in ancient Egypt, modern Egyptians would therefore be the most logical and closest approximation to the ancient Egyptians. In 2008, S. O. Y. Keita wrote that \\"There is no scientific reason to believe that the primary ancestors of the Egyptian population emerged and evolved outside of northeast Africa.... The basic overall genetic profile of the modern population is consistent with the diversity of ancient populations that would have been indigenous to northeastern Africa and subject to the range of evolutionary influences over time, although researchers vary in the details of their explanations of those influences.\\" According to Bernard R. Ortiz De Montellano, \\"the claim that all Egyptians, or even all the pharaohs, were black, is not valid. Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward the Sudan\\". Near-Eastern genetic affinity of Egyptian mummies Shared drift and mixture analysis of ancient Egyptian mummies with other ancient and modern and populations. The affinity is strongest (in red) with ancient populations of the Near East. A study published in 2017 by Schuenemann et al described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from a site near the modern village of Abusir el-Meleq in Middle Egypt, near the Faiyum Oasis. The area of Abusir el-Meleq, near El Fayum, was inhabited from at least 3250 BCE until about 700 CE. The scientists said that obtaining well-preserved, uncontaminated DNA from mummies has been a problem for the field and that these samples provided \\"the first reliable data set obtained from ancient Egyptians using high-throughput DNA sequencing methods\\". The study was able to measure the mitochondrial DNA of 90 individuals, and it showed that the mitochondrial DNA composition of Egyptian mummies has shown a high level of affinity with the DNA of the populations of the Near East. Genome-wide data could only be successfully extracted from three of these individuals. Of these three, the Y-chromosome haplogroups of two individuals could be assigned to the Middle-Eastern haplogroup J, and one to haplogroup E1b1b1 common in North Africa. The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African ancestry in these three individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is significantly lower than the level of sub- Saharan African ancestry in the modern Egyptians from Abusir el-Meleq, who \\"range from 14 to 21%.\\" The study's authors cautioned that the mummies may be unrepresentative of the Ancient Egyptian population as a whole. A shared drift and mixture analysis of the DNA of these ancient Egyptian mummies shows that the connection is strongest with ancient populations from the Levant, the Near East and Anatolia, and to a lesser extent modern populations from the Near East and the Levant. In particular the study finds \\"that ancient Egyptians are most closely related to Neolithic and Bronze Age samples in the Levant, as well as to Neolithic Anatolian populations\\".50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License: However, the study showed that comparative data from a contemporary population under Roman rule in Anatolia, did not reveal a closer relationship to the ancient Egyptians from the same period. furthermore, \\"Genetic continuity between ancient and modern Egyptians cannot be ruled out despite this sub-Saharan African influx, while continuity with modern Ethiopians is not supported\\". The current position of modern scholarship is that the Ancient Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\" in Mary R.

They state the study is missing 3000 years of Ancient Egypt's history, fails to include indigenous Nile valley Nubians as a comparison group, only includes New Kingdom and newer Northern Egyptian individuals, and incorrectly classifies \\"all mitochondrial M1 haplogroups as \\"Asian\\" which is problematic.\\" Keita et al. states, \\"M1 has been postulated to have emerged in Africa; many M1 daughter haplogroups (M1a) are clearly African in origin and history.\\" In conclusion, Keita/Gourdine state due to the small sample size (2.4% of Egypt's nomes), the \\"Schuenemann et al. study is best seen as a contribution to understanding a local population history in northern Egypt as opposed to a population history of all Egypt from its inception.\\" Professor Stephen Quirke, an Egyptologist at University College London, expressed caution about the researchers‚Äô broader claims, saying that ‚ÄúThere has been this very strong attempt throughout the history of Egyptology to disassociate ancient Egyptians from the modern population.‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúparticularly suspicious of any statement that may have the unintended consequences of asserting ‚Äì yet again from a northern European or North American perspective ‚Äì that there‚Äôs a discontinuity there [between ancient and modern Egyptians]\\". Ancient Egyptian genetic studies A number of scientific papers have reported, based on both maternal and paternal genetic evidence, that a substantial back-flow of people took place from Eurasia into North-east Africa, including Egypt, around 30,000 years before the start of the Dynastic period.Diversity of 17-locus Y-STR haplotypes in Upper (Southern) Egyptians Ghada A. Omran, Guy N. Rutty, Mark A. Jobling, 2007, Forensic Science International: Genetics Supplement Series 1 (2008) 230‚Äì232, at Some authors have offered a theory that the M haplogroup may have developed in Africa before the 'Out of Africa' event around 50,000 years ago, and dispersed in Africa from East Africa 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Specific current-day controversies Today the issues regarding the race of the ancient Egyptians are \\"troubled waters which most people who write about ancient Egypt from within the mainstream of scholarship avoid.\\"Ancient Egypt: anatomy of a civilization, by Barry J. Kemp, pg 47, view at The debate, therefore, takes place mainly in the public sphere and tends to focus on a small number of specific issues. Tutankhamun Mask of Tutankhamun Several scholars, including Diop, have claimed that Tutankhamun was black, and have protested that attempted reconstructions of Tutankhamun's facial features (as depicted on the cover of National Geographic magazine) have represented the king as \\"too white\\". Among these writers was Chancellor Williams, who argued that King Tutankhamun, his parents, and grandparents were black. Forensic artists and physical anthropologists from Egypt, France, and the United States independently created busts of Tutankhamun, using a CT-scan of the skull. Biological anthropologist Susan Anton, the leader of the American team, said the race of the skull was \\"hard to call\\". She stated that the shape of the cranial cavity indicated an African, while the nose opening suggested narrow nostrils, which is usually considered to be a European characteristic. The skull was thus concluded to be that of a North African. Other experts have argued that neither skull shapes nor nasal openings are a reliable indication of race. Although modern technology can reconstruct Tutankhamun's facial structure with a high degree of accuracy, based on CT data from his mummy, determining his skin tone and eye color is impossible. The clay model was therefore given a coloring, which, according to the artist, was based on an \\"average shade of modern Egyptians\\". Terry Garcia, National Geographics executive vice president for mission programs, said, in response to some of those protesting against the Tutankhamun reconstruction: > The big variable is skin tone. North Africans, we know today, had a range of > skin tones, from light to dark. In this case, we selected a medium skin > tone, and we say, quite up front, 'This is midrange.' We will never know for > sure what his exact skin tone was or the color of his eyes with 100% > certainty.... Maybe in the future, people will come to a different > conclusion. When pressed on the issue by American activists in September 2007, the Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, Zahi Hawass stated \\"Tutankhamun was not black.\\" In a November 2007 publication of Ancient Egypt magazine, Hawass asserted that none of the facial reconstructions resemble Tut and that, in his opinion, the most accurate representation of the boy king is the mask from his tomb. The Discovery Channel commissioned a facial reconstruction of Tutankhamun, based on CT scans of a model of his skull, back in 2002. In 2011, the genomics company iGENEA launched a Tutankhamun DNA project based on genetic markers that it indicated it had culled from a Discovery Channel special on the pharaoh. According to the firm, the microsatellite data suggested that Tutankhamun belonged to the haplogroup R1b1a2, the most common paternal clade among males in Western Europe. Carsten Pusch and Albert Zink, who led the unit that had extracted Tutankhamun's DNA, chided iGENEA for not liaising with them before establishing the project. After examining the footage, they also concluded that the methodology the company used was unscientific with Putsch calling them \\"simply impossible\\".  Cleopatra  The race and skin color of Cleopatra VII, the last active Hellenistic ruler of the Macedonian Greek Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt, established in 323 BCE, has also caused some debate,Hugh B. Price, although generally not in scholarly sources. For example, the article \\"Was Cleopatra Black?\\" was published in Ebony magazine in 2012,Charles Whitaker, The author cites a few examples of the claim, one of which is a chapter titled \\"Black Warrior Queens\\", published in 1984 in Black Women in Antiquity, part of The Journal of African Civilization series. It draws heavily on the work of J.A. Rogers. and an article about Afrocentrism from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch mentions the question, too.Mona Charen, Mary Lefkowitz, Professor Emerita of Classical Studies at Wellesley College, traces the origins of the black Cleopatra claim to the 1872 book by J.A. Rogers called \\"World's Great Men of Color.\\"World's Great Men of Color, Volume I, By J.A. Rogers; Simon and Schuster, 2011; Lefkowitz refutes Rogers' hypothesis, on various scholarly grounds. The black Cleopatra claim was further revived in an essay by afrocentrist John Henrik Clarke, chair of African history at Hunter College, entitled \\"African Warrior Queens.\\" Lefkowitz notes the essay includes the claim that Cleopatra described herself as black in the New Testament's Book of Acts ‚Äì when in fact Cleopatra had died more than sixty years before the death of Jesus Christ. The Berlin Cleopatra, a Roman sculpture and marble portrait of the queen in the Altes Museum, 1st century BC Scholars identify Cleopatra as essentially of Greek ancestry with some Persian and Syrian ancestry, based on the fact that her Macedonian Greek family (the Ptolemaic dynasty) had intermingled with the Seleucid aristocracy of the time.Tyldesley, pp. 30, 235‚Äì236. Grant states that Cleopatra probably had not a drop of Egyptian blood and that she \\"would have described herself as Greek.\\" Roller notes that \\"there is absolutely no evidence\\" that Cleopatra was racially black African as claimed by what he dismisses as generally not \\"credible scholarly sources.\\" Cleopatra's official coinage (which she would have approved) and the three portrait busts of her which are considered authentic by scholars, all match each other, and they portray Cleopatra as a Greek woman. Polo writes that Cleopatra's coinage presents her image with certainty, and asserts that the sculpted portrait of the \\"Berlin Cleopatra\\" head is confirmed as having a similar profile. In 2009, a BBC documentary speculated that Cleopatra might have been part North African. This was based largely on the claims of Hilke Th√ºr of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, who in the 1990s had examined a headless skeleton of a female child in a 20 BCE tomb in Ephesus (modern Turkey), together with the old notes and photographs of the now-missing skull. Th√ºr hypothesized the body as that of Arsinoe, half-sister to Cleopatra. Arsinoe and Cleopatra shared the same father (Ptolemy XII Auletes) but had different mothers,The Lives of Cleopatra and Octavia, By Sarah Fielding, Christopher D. Johnson, p. 154, Bucknell University Press, with Th√ºr claiming the alleged African ancestry came from the skeleton's mother. To date it has never been definitively proved that the skeleton is that of Arsinoe IV. Furthermore, craniometry as used by Th√ºr to determine race is based in scientific racism that is now generally considered a pseudoscience that supported \\"exploitation of groups of people\\" to \\"perpetuate racial oppression\\" and \\"distorted future views of the biological basis of race.\\" When a DNA test attempted to determine the identity of the child, it was impossible to get an accurate reading since the bones had been handled too many times, and the skull had been lost in Germany during World War II. Mary Beard states that the age of the skeleton is too young to be that of Arsinoe (the bones said to be that of a 15‚Äì18-year-old child, with Arsinoe being around her mid twenties at her death). Great Sphinx of Giza The Sphinx in profile in 2010 The identity of the model for the Great Sphinx of Giza is unknown. Most Egyptologists and scholars currently believe that the face of the Sphinx represents the likeness of the Pharaoh Khafra, although a few Egyptologists and interested amateurs have proposed several different hypotheses. An early description of the Sphinx, \\"typically negro in all its features\\", is recorded in the travel notes of a French scholar, Volney, who visited in Egypt between 1783 and 1785 along with French novelist Gustave Flaubert.\\"... its head is grey, ears very large and protruding like a negro's ... the fact that the nose is missing increases the flat, negroid effect ... the lips are thick....\\" Flaubert, Gustave. Flaubert in Egypt, ed. Francis Steegmuller. (London: Penguin Classics, 1996). . A similar description was given in the \\"well-known book\\" by Vivant Denon, where he described the sphinx as \\"the character is African; but the mouth, the lips of which are thick.\\" Following Volney, Denon, and other early writers, numerous Afrocentric scholars, such as Du Bois,Black man of the Nile and his family, by Yosef Ben-Jochannan, pp. 109‚Äì110 Diop and Asante have characterized the face of the Sphinx as Black, or \\"Negroid\\". American geologist Robert M. Schoch has written that the \\"Sphinx has a distinctive African, Nubian, or Negroid aspect which is lacking in the face of Khafre\\". but he was described by others such as Ronald H. Fritze and Mark Lehner of being a \\"pseudoscientific writer\\".Fritze, Ronald H. (2009). Invented Knowledge: False History, Fake Science and Pseudo-Religions. Reaktion Books. \\"Scholars Dispute Claim That Sphinx Is Much Older\\". The New York Times, 09 February 1992. David S. Anderson writes in Lost City, Found Pyramid: Understanding Alternative Archaeologies and Pseudoscientific Practices that Van Sertima's claim that \\"the sphinx was a portrait statue of the black pharoah Khafre\\" is a form of \\"pseudoarchaeology\\" not supported by evidence. He compares it to the claim that Olmec colossal heads had \\"African origins\\", which is not taken seriously by Mesoamerican scholars such as Richard Diehl and Ann Cyphers.Diehl 2004, p.112. Cyphers 1996, p. 156. Kemet { border=\\"1\\" style=\\"float:right; margin:9px 1em 1em;\\" +km in Egyptian hieroglyphs - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" km biliteral kmt (place) kmt (people) - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" km km:t*O49 km:t-A1-B1-Z3 } Ancient Egyptians referred to their homeland as Kmt (conventionally pronounced as Kemet). According to Cheikh Anta Diop, the Egyptians referred to themselves as \\"Black\\" people or kmt, and km was the etymological root of other words, such as Kam or Ham, which refer to Black people in Hebrew tradition. A review of David Goldenberg's The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity and Islam states that Goldenberg \\"argues persuasively that the biblical name Ham bears no relationship at all to the notion of blackness and as of now is of unknown etymology\\". Diop, William Leo Hansberry, and Aboubacry Moussa LamAboubacry Moussa Lam, \\"L'√âgypte ancienne et l'Afrique\\", in Maria R. Turano et Paul Vandepitte, Pour une histoire de l'Afrique, 2003, pp. 50 &51 have argued that kmt was derived from the skin color of the Nile valley people, which Diop claimed was black. The claim that the ancient Egyptians had black skin has become a cornerstone of Afrocentric historiography. Mainstream scholars hold that kmt means \\"the black land\\" or \\"the black place\\", and that this is a reference to the fertile black soil that was washed down from Central Africa by the annual Nile inundation. By contrast the barren desert outside the narrow confines of the Nile watercourse was called d≈°rt (conventionally pronounced deshret) or \\"the red land\\".Shavit 2001: 148 Raymond Faulkner's Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian translates kmt into \\"Egyptians\\",Raymond Faulkner, A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian, Oxford: Griffith Institute, 2002, p. 286. Gardiner translates it as \\"the Black Land, Egypt\\". At the UNESCO Symposium in 1974, Sauneron, Obenga, and Diop concluded that KMT and KM meant black. However, Sauneron clarified that the adjective Kmtyw means \\"people of the black land\\" rather than \\"black people\\", and that the Egyptians never used the adjective Kmtyw to refer to the various black peoples they knew of, they only used it to refer to themselves. Ancient Egyptian art Ancient Egyptian tombs and temples contained thousands of paintings, sculptures, and written works, which reveal a great deal about the people of that time. However, their depictions of themselves in their surviving art and artifacts are rendered in sometimes symbolic, rather than realistic, pigments. As a result, ancient Egyptian artifacts provide sometimes conflicting and inconclusive evidence of the ethnicity of the people who lived in Egypt during dynastic times.Charlotte Booth, The Ancient Egyptians for Dummies (2007) p. 217 In their own art, \\"Egyptians are often represented in a color that is officially called dark red\\", according to Diop. Arguing against other theories, Diop quotes Champollion-Figeac, who states, \\"one distinguishes on Egyptian monuments several species of blacks, differing...with respect to complexion, which makes Negroes black or copper-colored.\\" Regarding an expedition by King Sesostris, Cherubini states the following concerning captured southern africans, \\"except for the panther skin about their loins, are distinguished by their color, some entirely black, others dark brown. University of Chicago scholars assert that Nubians are generally depicted with black paint, but the skin pigment used in Egyptian paintings to refer to Nubians can range \\"from dark red to brown to black\\". This can be observed in paintings from the tomb of the Egyptian Huy, as well as Ramses II's temple at Beit el-Wali. Also, Snowden indicates that Romans had accurate knowledge of \\"negroes of a red, copper-colored complexion ... among African tribes\\". Conversely, Najovits states \\"Egyptian art depicted Egyptians on the one hand and Nubians and other blacks on the other hand with distinctly different ethnic characteristics and depicted this abundantly and often aggressively. The Egyptians accurately, arrogantly and aggressively made national and ethnic distinctions from a very early date in their art and literature.\\"Egypt, Trunk of the Tree, A Modern Survey of an Ancient Land, Vol. 2. by Simson Najovits p. 318 He continues, \\"There is an extraordinary abundance of Egyptian works of art which clearly depicted sharply contrasted reddish-brown Egyptians and black Nubians.\\" Barbara Mertz writes in Red Land, Black Land: Daily Life in Ancient Egypt: \\"The concept of race would have been totally alien to them [Ancient Egyptians] [..]The skin color that painters usually used for men is a reddish brown. Women were depicted as lighter in complexion, perhaps because they didn‚Äôt spend so much time out of doors. Some individuals are shown with black skins. I cannot recall a single example of the words ‚Äúblack,‚Äù ‚Äúbrown,‚Äù or ‚Äúwhite‚Äù being used in an Egyptian text to describe a person.\\" She gives the example of one of Thutmose III‚Äôs ‚Äúsole companions‚Äù, who was Nubian or Cushite. In his funerary scroll, he is shown with dark brown skin instead of the conventional reddish brown used for Egyptians. = Table of Nations controversy = However, Manu Ampim, a professor at Merritt College specializing in African and African American history and culture, claims in the book Modern Fraud: The Forged Ancient Egyptian Statues of Ra-Hotep and Nofret, that many ancient Egyptian statues and artworks are modern frauds that have been created specifically to hide the \\"fact\\" that the ancient Egyptians were black, while authentic artworks that demonstrate black characteristics are systematically defaced or even \\"modified\\". Ampim repeatedly makes the accusation that the Egyptian authorities are systematically destroying evidence that \\"proves\\" that the ancient Egyptians were black, under the guise of renovating and conserving the applicable temples and structures. He further accuses \\"European\\" scholars of wittingly participating in and abetting this process.\\"Ra-Hotep and Nofret: Modern Forgeries in the Cairo Museum?\\" pp. 207‚Äì212 in Egypt: Child of Africa (1994), edited by Ivan Van Sertima. Asiatics), \\"Nehesu\\" (Nubians), and \\"Themehu\\" (Libyans); middle row: a deity, \\"Reth\\" (Egyptians), \\"Aamu\\" (Asiatics). Ampim has a specific concern about the painting of the \\"Table of Nations\\" in the Tomb of Ramesses III (KV11). The \\"Table of Nations\\" is a standard painting that appears in a number of tombs, and they were usually provided for the guidance of the soul of the deceased. Among other things, it described the \\"four races of men\\" as follows: (translation by E.A. Wallis Budge) \\"The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third are NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians, the AAMU are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the NEHESU are the black races, and the THEMEHU are the fair-skinned Libyans.\\" The archaeologist Karl Richard Lepsius documented many ancient Egyptian tomb paintings in his work Denkm√§ler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien. In 1913, after the death of Lepsius, an updated reprint of the work was produced, edited by Kurt Sethe. This printing included an additional section, called the \\"Erg√§nzungsband\\" in German, which incorporated many illustrations that did not appear in Lepsius' original work. One of them, plate 48, illustrated one example of each of the four \\"nations\\" as depicted in KV11, and shows the \\"Egyptian nation\\" and the \\"Nubian nation\\" as identical to each other in skin color and dress. Professor Ampim has declared that plate 48 is a true reflection of the original painting, and that it \\"proves\\" that the ancient Egyptians were identical in appearance to the Nubians, even though he admits no other examples of the \\"Table of Nations\\" show this similarity. He has further accused \\"Euro-American writers\\" of attempting to mislead the public on this issue. The late Egyptologist Frank J. Yurco visited the tomb of Ramesses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramesses III tomb reliefs he pointed out that the depiction of plate 48 in the Erg√§nzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted on the walls of the tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a \\"pastiche\\" of samples of what is on the tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius' notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings.Frank Yurco, \\"Two Tomb- Wall Painted Reliefs of Ramesses III and Sety I and Ancient Nile Valley Population Diversity\\", in Egypt in Africa (1996), ed. by Theodore Celenko. (Erik Hornung, The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity, 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians. = Fayyum mummy portraits = The Roman era Fayum mummy portraits attached to coffins containing the latest dated mummies discovered in the Faiyum Oasis represent a population of both native Egyptians and those with mixed Greek heritage.Bagnall, R.S. (2000). Susan Walker (ed.). Ancient Faces: Mummy Portraits in Roman Egypt. Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications. New York: Routledge. p. 27.

Their own artistic conventions painted them as pink, but pictures on their tombs show they often married queens shown as entirely black being from the south.\\" Yaacov Shavit wrote that \\"Egyptian men have a reddish complexion, while Egyptian women have a clear yellowish cast; and moreover there are almost no black women in the many wall paintings.\\" Ahmose-Nefertari is an example. In most depictions of Ahmose-Nefertari, she is pictured with black skin, while in some instances her skin is blue, p.175 or red.https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/former-queen-ahmose-nefertari- protectress-royal-tomb-workers-deified In 1939 Flinders Petrie said \\"an invasion from the south...established a black queen as the divine ancestress of the XVIIIth dynasty\\" p.155 He also said \\"a possibility of the black being symbolic has been suggested\\" p.155 and \\"Nefertari must have married a Libyan, as she was the mother of Amenhetep I, who was of fair Libyan style.\\" p.155 In 1961 Alan Gardiner, in describing the walls of tombs in the Deir el-Medina area, noted in passing that Ahmose-Nefertari was \\"well represented\\" in these tomb illustrations, and that her countenance was sometimes black and sometimes blue. He did not offer any explanation for these colors, but noted that her probable ancestry ruled out that she might have had black blood. In 1974, Diop described Ahmose-Nefertari as \\"typically negroid.\\" In the controversial book Black Athena, the hypotheses of which have been widely rejected by mainstream scholarship, Martin Bernal considered her skin color in paintings to be a clear sign of Nubian ancestry.Martin Bernal (1987), Black Athena: Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization. The Fabrication of Ancient Greece, 1785-1985, vol. I. New Jersey, Rutgers University Press In more recent times, scholars such as Joyce Tyldesley, Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes, and Graciela Gestoso Singer, argued that her skin color is indicative of her role as a goddess of resurrection, since black is both the color of the fertile land of Egypt and that of Duat, the underworld.Graciela Gestoso Singer, \\"Ahmose-Nefertari, The Woman in Black\\". Terrae Antiqvae, January 17, 2011 Singer recognizes that \\"Some scholars have suggested that this is a sign of Nubian ancestry.\\" Singer also states a statuette of Ahmose-Nefertari at the Museo Egizio in Turin which shows her with a black face, though her arms and feet are not darkened, thus suggesting that the black coloring has an iconographic motive and does not reflect her actual appearance.Tyldesley, Joyce. Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2006. Hodel-Hoenes, S & Warburton, D (trans), Life and Death in Ancient Egypt: Scenes from Private Tombs in New Kingdom Thebes, Cornell University Press, 2000, p. 268. Queen Tiye is another example of the controversy. American journalists Michael Specter, Felicity Barringer, and others describe one of her sculptures as that of a \\"black African\\". Egyptologist Frank J. Yurco has examined her mummy, which he described as having 'long, wavy brown hair, a high-bridged, arched nose and moderately thin lips.\\" Queen Tiye; Grandmother of Pharaoh Tutankhamun Historical hypotheses Since the second half of the 20th century, typological and hierarchical models of race have increasingly been rejected by scientists, and most scholars have held that applying modern notions of race to ancient Egypt is anachronistic. The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\" in Mary R.

Zakrzewski: Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state ‚Äì Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003) At the UNESCO symposium in 1974, most participants concluded that the ancient Egyptian population was indigenous to the Nile Valley, and was made up of people from north and south of the Sahara who were differentiated by their color. Black Egyptian hypothesis The Black Egyptian hypothesis, which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship, is the hypothesis that ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa and a Black civilization. Although there is consensus that Ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa, the hypothesis that Ancient Egypt was a \\"black civilization\\" has met with \\"profound\\" disagreement. The Black Egyptian hypothesis includes a particular focus on links to Sub Saharan cultures and the questioning of the race of specific notable individuals from Dynastic times, including Tutankhamun the person represented in the Great Sphinx of Giza, and the Greek Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra.Hugh B. Price, Charles Whitaker, The author cites a few examples of the claim, one of which is a chapter titled \\"Black Warrior Queens\\", published in 1984 in Black Women in Antiquity, part of The Journal of African Civilization series. It draws heavily on the work of J.A. Rogers.Mona Charen, Advocates of the Black African model rely heavily on writings from Classical Greek historians, including Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Herodotus. Advocates claim that these \\"classical\\" authors referred to Egyptians as \\"Black with woolly hair\\". The Greek word used was \\"melanchroes\\", and the English language translation of this Greek word is disputed, being translated by many as \\"dark skinned\\" and by many others as \\"black\\". Diop said \\"Herodotus applied melanchroes to both Ethiopians and Egyptians...and melanchroes is the strongest term in Greek to denote blackness.\\" Snowden claims that Diop is distorting his classical sources and is quoting them selectively. There is dispute about the historical accuracy of the works of Herodotus ‚Äì some scholars support the reliability of Herodotus while other scholars regard his works as being unreliable as historical sources, particularly those relating to Egypt. Other claims used to support the Black Hypothesis included testing melanin levels in a small sample of mummies, language affinities between ancient Egyptian language and sub- saharan languages,Alain Ricard, Naomi Morgan, The Languages & Literatures of Africa: The Sands of Babel, James Currey, 2004, p. 14 interpretations of the origin of the name Kmt, conventionally pronounced Kemet, used by the ancient Egyptians to describe themselves or their land (depending on points of view), biblical traditions, shared B blood group between Egyptians and West Africans, and interpretations of the depictions of the Egyptians in numerous paintings and statues. The hypothesis also claimed cultural affiliations, such as circumcision, matriarchy, totemism, hair braiding, head binding, and kingship cults. Artifacts found at Qustul (near Abu Simbel ‚Äì Modern Sudan) in 1960‚Äì64 were seen as showing that ancient Egypt and the A-Group culture of Nubia shared the same culture and were part of the greater Nile Valley sub-stratum, but more recent finds in Egypt indicate that the Qustul rulers probably adopted/emulated the symbols of Egyptian pharaohs. Authors and critics state the hypothesis is primarily adopted by Afrocentrists.\\"Patterson properly noted that the \\"contributionist approach,\\" now commonly called Afrocentric, does violence to the facts, is ideologically bankrupt, and is methodologically deficient. He pointed out that in many respects only a small part of the history of the African continent is relevant to the Afro-American experience, because it has been long established that the vast majority of American blacks came from the western coast of Africa. And he correctly observed that there is no justification for defining the term \\"black\\" to include all the swarthy peoples of Egypt and north Africa.\\" \\"It is ironic that today much of Afrocentric writing about Egypt is based on the same evidence used by earlier Heliocentric authors. However, now the claim is that ancient Egypt was a black African civilization and that Egyptians (or at least the rulers and the cultural leaders) were negroid (Diop, 1974, 1981; Williams, 1974), No one disputes that Egypt is in Africa, or that its civilization had elements in common with sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in religion. However, the claim that all Egyptians, or even all the pharaohs, were black, is not valid. Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward the Sudan\\" At the UNESCO \\"Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic script\\" in Cairo in 1974, there was consensus that Ancient Egypt was indigenous to Africa, but the Black Hypothesis met with \\"profound\\" disagreement. The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\" in Mary R.

Zakrzewski: Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state ‚Äì Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003) Asiatic race theory The Asiatic race theory, which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship, is the hypothesis that the ancient Egyptians were the lineal descendants of the biblical Ham, through his son Mizraim. This theory was the most dominant view from the Early Middle Ages (c. 500 AD) all the way up to the early 19th century.\\"The Hamitic Hypothesis; Its Origin and Functions in Time Perspective\\", Edith R. Sanders, The Journal of African History, Vol. 10, No. 4, 1969, pp. 521‚Äì532.The Origin of Egyptian Civilisation, Edouard Naville, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 37, 1907, p. 201. The descendants of Ham were traditionally considered to be the darkest-skinned branch of humanity, either because of their geographic allotment to Africa or because of the Curse of Ham.Sanders, 1969, pp. 521‚Äì523. Thus, Diop cites Gaston Maspero \\"Moreover, the Bible states that Mesraim, son of Ham, brother of Chus (Kush) ... and of Canaan, came from Mesopotamia to settle with his children on the banks of the Nile.\\" By the 20th century, the Asiatic race theory and its various offshoots were abandoned but were superseded by two related theories: the Eurocentric Hamitic hypothesis, asserting that a Caucasian racial group moved into North and East Africa from early prehistory subsequently bringing with them all advanced agriculture, technology and civilization, and the Dynastic race theory, proposing that Mesopotamian invaders were responsible for the dynastic civilization of Egypt (c. 3000 BC). In sharp contrast to the Asiatic race theory, neither of these theories proposes that Caucasians were the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt.Sanders, 1969, pp. 524‚Äì527ff. At the UNESCO \\"Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script\\" in Cairo in 1974, none of the participants explicitly voiced support for any theory where Egyptians were Caucasian with a dark pigmentation.\\"UNESCO, Symposium on the Peopling of Ancient Egypt and the Deciphering of the Meroitic Script; Proceedings, (Paris: 1978), pp. 3‚Äì134. The current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\" in Mary R.

Zakrzewski: Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state ‚Äì Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003)  Caucasian / Hamitic hypothesis The Caucasian hypothesis, which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship, is the hypothesis that the Nile valley \\"was originally peopled by a branch of the Caucasian race\\".The Rise and Fall of the Caucasian Race: A Political History of Racial Identity By Bruce Baum, p. 108 It was proposed in 1844 by Samuel George Morton, who acknowledged that Negroes were present in ancient Egypt but claimed they were either captives or servants. George Gliddon (1844) wrote: \\"Asiatic in their origin .... the Egyptians were white men, of no darker hue than a pure Arab, a Jew, or a Phoenician.\\"George Robins Gliddon Ancient Egypt: Her monuments, hieroglyphics, history and archaeology 1844, p. 46 The similar Hamitic hypothesis, which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship, developed directly from the Asiatic Race Theory, and argued that the Ethiopid and Arabid populations of the Horn of Africa were the inventors of agriculture and had brought all civilization to Africa. It asserted that these people were Caucasians, not Negroid. It also rejected any Biblical basis despite using Hamitic as the theory's name.Sanders, 1969, pp. 525‚Äì532. Charles Gabriel Seligman in his Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1913) and later works argued that the ancient Egyptians were among this group of Caucasian Hamites, having arrived in the Nile Valley during early prehistory and introduced technology and agriculture to primitive natives they found there.C.G. Seligman, \\"Some Aspects of the Hamitic Problem in the Anglo- Egyptian Sudan\\", The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, Vol. 43 (July‚ÄìDecember 1913), pp. 593‚Äì705. The Italian anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi (1901) believed that ancient Egyptians were the Eastern African (Hamitic) branch of the Mediterranean race, which he called \\"Eurafrican\\". According to Sergi, the Mediterranean race or \\"Eurafrican\\" contains three varieties or sub-races: the African (Hamitic) branch, the Mediterranean \\"proper\\" branch and the Nordic (depigmented) branch.The Mediterranean Race: a Study of the Origins of European Peoples, 1901, pp. v‚Äìvi, \\"Preface\\", also p. 45. Sergi maintained in summary that the Mediterranean race (excluding the depigmented Nordic or 'white') is: \\"a brown human variety, neither white nor Negroid, but pure in its elements, that is to say not a product of the mixture of Whites with Negroes or Negroid peoples\\".Sergi, 1901, p. 250. Grafton Elliot Smith modified the theory in 1911,\\"Concepts of Race in the Historiography of Northeast Africa\\", Wyatt MacGaffey, The Journal of African History, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1966. stating that the ancient Egyptians were a dark haired \\"brown race\\",The Ancient Egyptians and the origin of Civilization, 1911, p. 69. most closely \\"linked by the closest bonds of racial affinity to the Early Neolithic populations of the North African littoral and South Europe\\",Smith, 1911, p. 25. and not Negroid.As according to Smith the hair of the \\"Proto-Egyptian was precisely similar to that of the brunet South European\\" and \\"presented no resemblance whatever to the so-called 'wooly' appearance and peppercorn-like arrangement of the Negro's hair\\". ‚Äì Smith, 1911, p. 58. Smith's \\"brown race\\" is not synonymous or equivalent with Sergi's Mediterranean race.\\"Neither in Sergi's nor in Elliot Smith's scheme are Brown and Mediterranean equivalent terms.\\" ‚Äì MacGaffey, 1966, p. 4. The Hamitic Hypothesis was still popular in the 1960s and late 1970s and was supported notably by Anthony John Arkell and George Peter Murdock.Sanders, 1969, pp. 531; MacGaffey, 1966, pp. 5‚Äì9.

It was proposed by Egyptologist Samuel Sharpe in 1846, who was \\"inspired\\" by some ancient Egyptian paintings, which depict Egyptians with sallow or yellowish skin. He said \\"From the colour given to the women in their paintings we learn that their skin was yellow, like that of the Mongul Tartars, who have given their name to the Mongolian variety of the human race.... The single lock of hair on the young nobles reminds us also of the Tartars.\\"History of Egypt, 1846, Part I, p. 3 \\"The Asiatic Origin of the Race.

Zakrzewski: Population continuity or population change: Formation of the ancient Egyptian state ‚Äì Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, Highfield, Southampton (2003) Dynastic race theory The Dynastic race theory, which has been rejected by mainstream scholarship, is the hypothesis that a Mesopotamian force had invaded Egypt in predynastic times, imposed itself on the indigenous Badarian people, and become their rulers.Early dynastic Egypt, by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, p. 15 It further argued that the Mesopotamian-founded state or states then conquered both Upper and Lower Egypt and founded the First Dynasty of Egypt. It was proposed in the early 20th century by Egyptologist Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, who deduced that skeletal remains found at pre-dynastic sites at Naqada (Upper Egypt) indicated the presence of two different races, with one race differentiated physically by a noticeably larger skeletal structure and cranial capacity.Derry, D.E., The Dynastic Race in Egypt, Journal of Egyptian Archeology, vol 42, 1956 Petrie also noted new architectural styles‚Äîthe distinctly Mesopotamian \\"niched- facade\\" architecture‚Äîpottery styles, cylinder seals and a few artworks, as well as numerous Predynastic rock and tomb paintings depicting Mesopotamian style boats, symbols, and figures. Based on plentiful cultural evidence, Petrie concluded that the invading ruling elite was responsible for the seemingly sudden rise of Egyptian civilization. In the 1950s, the Dynastic Race Theory was widely accepted by mainstream scholarship.Mary R. Lefkowitz, Guy MacLean Rogers, Black Athena Revisited, pg65Early dynastic Egypt, by Toby A. H. Wilkinson, pg 15 While there is clear evidence the Naqada II culture borrowed abundantly from Mesopotamia, the Naqada II period had a large degree of continuity with the Naqada I period,Gardiner, Alan. Egypt of the Pharaohs (Oxford: University Press, 1961), p. 392. and the changes which did happen during the Naqada periods happened over significant amounts of time.Shaw, Ian. and Nicholson, Paul, The Dictionary of Ancient Egypt (London: British Museum Press, 1995), p. 228. The most commonly held view today is that the achievements of the First Dynasty were the result of a long period of cultural and political development,Early Dynastic Egypt (Routledge, 1999), p.15 and the current position of modern scholarship is that the Egyptian civilization was an indigenous Nile Valley development (see population history of Egypt).Prehistory and Protohsitory of Egypt, Emile Massoulard, 1949Frank Yurco, \\"An Egyptological Review\\" in Mary R.

He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft. He was also a member of the Dallas Desperados, Austin Wranglers, and Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League (AFL), and the Amarillo Dusters (then of the IFL). He played college football at West Texas A&M.; Early years Larrimore attended Locke High School, where he played only one year of football as a cornerback and returner. Because of poor grades, he spent one year after graduating earning his GED, before walking-on at Cerritos Junior College where he was named junior college All-American in his second year. After the gang-related death of his brother, he transferred to West Texas A&M;, where he received Division II All-American and All-Lone Star Conference honors. As a junior in 1998, he had 34 tackles (4 for loss), two interceptions (which he returned for 90 yards and one touchdown) and 7 passes defensed, along with 20 kickoff returns for 532 yards (26.6 avg.) and one touchdown of 100 yards (tied a school record). As a senior in 1999, he missed the season opener, but played the rest of the year and had 32 tackles, 5 interceptions (which he returned for 109 total yards and a 74-yard touchdown) and 10 passes defensed, along with 15 kickoff returns for 318 yards. After the season, he played in the Blue-Gray All-Star Game, where he returned a kickoff 99 yards for a touchdown, which was a first in the 62-year history of the game. He also played in the Senior Bowl. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Larrimore was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the fourth round (109th overall) of the 2000 NFL Draft, after dropping because of character concerns and failing a marijuana test in the scouting combine. He impressed the team with his athletic ability from the beginning and moved ahead of fellow rookie draft picks Dwayne Goodrich and Mario Edwards. Two weeks into training camp, he was named the starter at left cornerback in place of a retired Kevin Smith. He was just the second rookie in franchise history (Ron Francis was the first) to start at cornerback in the season opener, but he struggled and was replaced with the more experienced Phillippi Sparks after the fourth game of the season. The move didn't sit well with him and violations of team rules started to affect his standing with the team. In 2001, he was suspended for the final preseason game, the season opener and fined for missing curfew when the Cowboys traveled to Mexico City to play the Oakland Raiders in the American Bowl. He eventually was released on October 23, with reports later surfacing that he had been fined at least 11 other times for various reasons. Larrimore played for the Cowboys for two seasons, appearing in 19 regular season games (15 in 2000, four in 2001) and starting in 6 games. Dallas Desperados (AFL) On May 21, 2002, he signed with the Dallas Desperados of the Arena Football League, who were owned by Jerry Jones, who also owned the Dallas Cowboys. As a rookie, he played in nine games, earning the position as the team‚Äôs top kick returner and defensive specialist. He received AFL All-Rookie honors after finishing with 24.5 tackles, 5 passes defensed and one interception. In 2003, knee and back injuries limited him to seven games, while spending time on the Reserve/Injured list three times. He recorded 26.5 tackles, 4 passes defensed, 2 interceptions and 27 kickoff returns for 476 yards (17.6 avg.). Chicago Rush (AFL) Larrimore was selected by the Austin Wranglers in the league's expansion draft, but was traded to the Chicago Rush in exchange for Cedric Walker on October 15, 2003. He was waived on April 7, 2004, after registering 11 tackles, one interception, 21 kickoff returns for 485 yards and 2 touchdowns. Amarillo Dusters (IFL) After three seasons in the Arena Football League, Larrimore signed with the Amarillo Dusters then of the Intense Football League, on May 28, 2004. Inglewood Blackhawks (LCFL) In 2009, he signed with the Inglewood Blackhawks of the LCFL West Semi pro league. He helped the team win the 2010 LCFL Championship.

Sauce from 1913 OK Sauce is a brand of brown sauce manufactured in the United Kingdom, first by George Mason & Company and later by Colmans. Early history OK Sauce was first made in a factory called the Chelsea Works (formerly a swimming pool) in London. In 1928 production was transferred to a purpose-built factory to the designs of Percy Sharp, at 265 Merton Road, Southfields, in the London Borough of Wandsworth. The company's official title was George Mason & Co Ltd. However, George Mason left the firm before World War 1 and the company was run by the Cooper family, initially by Percy Cooper, then by his son Rex Cooper as Chairman and MD. Colmans Rex's son, Brian, together with Rex's sister Betty Urwin, oversaw the changeover to Colmans. In addition to OK sauce, other sauces and chutneys were made. They also had a satellite factory (called Watersend Condiments) in a converted farm building beside a manor house at Temple Ewell, Dover. This concentrated on horseradish sauce, mint sauce and mint jelly. The factories continued to make sauces until 1969 when the owners of the company sold it off to Reckitt and Colman at Norwich. The products had a Royal Warrant which ceased around the takeover. All production was transferred to Norwich and both factories closed. However, the Art Deco facade of the Southfields building, visible from Merton Road still exists and has been awarded Grade 2 listing status in August 2002. Colmans continues to make OK Sauce and other condiments. OK Sauce's main market is today in the Far East and UK domestic Chinese communities.

The Men's first crew won blades in the May Bumps in 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2014 and 2019. M1, blades, Lents 2012 History Hughes Hall first competed in the May Bumps in 1979 when the men started at 112th on the river and went down two places while the women started at 20th on the river and went down three places. The following year the men achieved HHBC's first ever bump on Sidney Sussex M6 but the women had to wait until 1999 to achieve their first May bump. In 2003 there was an official merger with the boat club of Lucy Cavendish College, an all-women's college of Cambridge University. The result was a combined club formally recognised by the Cambridge University Combined Boat Clubs as the \\"Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish Combined Boat Club\\". This combination was the only of its type at Cambridge. Since the merging of the two college boat clubs, Hughes Hall/ Lucy Cavendish have enjoyed significant advances marked by three squads winning blades during the May Bumps 2009, including a 10 place gain by M2.Bumps Charts  CUCBC It was also the first time the boat club fielded four crews into the May Bumps.

Living in Pueblo Libre, then still little more than an agricultural town on the edge of Lima, he sold octopus and other sea food on the street before founding his tavern, Antigua Taberna Queirolo. Here he sold traditional Peruvian Creole food and bottles of wine and Pisco from grapes grown on land he bought around Ca√±ete, south of the city.

In popular usage, the term carries overwhelmingly negative connotations, although this does not reflect scholarly understanding. Potential sources for deep state organization include organs of state, such as the armed forces or public authorities (intelligence agencies, police, secret police, administrative agencies, and government bureaucracy). A deep state can also take the form of entrenched career civil servants acting in a non-conspiratorial discretionary manner to further their agency mission or the public good, sometimes in contravention of the current political administration. The intent of a deep state can include continuity of the state itself, job security for its members, enhanced power and authority, and the pursuit of ideological or programmatic objectives. It can operate in opposition to the agenda of elected officials, by obstructing, resisting, and subverting their policies, conditions and directives.  Etymology and historical usage  The modern concept of a deep state is associated with Turkey, a presumed secret network of military officers and their civilian allies trying to preserve the secular order based on the ideas of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk from 1923. Similar ideas are older. The Greek language Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒøœÇ ·ºêŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒµŒπ, (kratos en kratei) was later adopted into Latin as imperium in imperiofrom Baruch Spinoza: Tractatus politicus, Caput II, ¬ß 6. or status in statu). In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries political debate surrounding the separation of church and state often revolved around the perception that if left unchecked the Church might turn into a kind of State within a State, an illegitimate encroachment of the State's natural civil power.Cf William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England, IV, c.4 ss. iii.2, p. *54, where the charge of being imperium in imperio was notably levied against the Church At the beginning of the 20th century, the deep state was also used to refer to government-owned corporations or private companies that act independently of regulatory or governmental control.Daniel De Leon: \\"Imperium in imperio\\" in: Daily People, June 4, 1903.  Scholarly understanding  Within social science in general and political science specifically, scholars distinguish between positivism (\\"what is\\") and normativism (\\"what should be\\"). Because political science deals with topics which are inherently political and often controversial, this distinction between \\"what is\\" (positive) and \\"what should be\\" (normative) is critical because it allows diverse people with different preferred worlds to discuss the causes, workings, and effects of policies and social structures. Thus, while readers may disagree on the normative qualities of the \\"deep state\\" (i.e. whether it is good or bad), it is still possible to study the positive qualities (i.e. its origins and effects) without requiring a normative judgement. In the field of political science, the normative pop culture concept of the deep state is studied within the literature on the state. Current literature on the state generally traces a lineage to Bringing the State Back In (1985) and remains an active body of scholarly research as of 2020. Within this literature, the state is understood as both venue (a set of rules under which others act and interact) as well as actor (with its own agenda). An example of a non-conspiratorial version of the 'state as actor' from the empirical scholarly literature would be \\"doing truth to power\\" (as a play on speaking truth to power, which is what journalists often aspire to do) as studied by Todd La Porte. Under this dual understanding, the conspiratorial version of the deep state concept would be one version of the 'state as actor' while the non-conspiratorial version would be another version of the 'state as actor.' The fundamental takeaway from the scholarly literature on the dual nature of the state is that the 'state as actor' (deep state) is a functional characteristic of all states which has effects that may be normatively judged as \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" in different times, places, and contexts. From a positivist scientific perspective, the state-as-venue, colloquially known as the \\"deep state,\\" simply \\"is\\" and should not be assumed to be \\"bad\\" by default.  Intellectual history of concept  While the state has been one of the longest-studied topics in political science, sociology, and economics, the rise of new institutionalism(s) in the 1970s brought to the forefront the dual nature of the state as both venue (a set of rules under which others act and interact) as well as actor (with its own agenda). This new institutionalism stands in contrast to the immediately prior behavioral revolution which focused on society-centered explanations for political outcomes where the state was primarily or solely seen as an arena where interest groups vied for political power.  State-as-actor versus state-as-venue  The normative pop culture concept of the deep state is distinguished from the classical concept of the state within the scholarly literature on the state by the dual nature of the state as both an actor (which pursues certain ends) and a venue (which structures interaction between actors). In this dyad, the \\"deep state\\" is called the state-as-actor while the classical concept of the state is called the state-as-venue. = State-as-venue = To distinguish the traditional, formal processes of the state from the state-as-actor, the state- as-venue view reflects the state serving as an arena in which actors act. Under this concept, the state is seen as a passive organizational structure within which societal actors (e.g. interest groups, classes) compete for power, influence, and resources. = State-as-actor = The state-as-actor concept subsumes the activities described by the pop culture concept of the deep state by focusing on all forms of state goal formation and pursuit which are independent of external societal actors (e.g. interest groups, classes). Positivist political science and sociology further break this concept down into state autonomy and state capacity. State autonomy refers to a state's ability to pursue interests insulated from external social and economic influence. State capacity reflects the state's skills, knowledge, tools, equipment, and other resources needed to do their jobs competently. Together, autonomy and capacity are necessary for states to implement all policy including that delegated by political leaders, court decisions, and agency or ministry programmatic as well as the subversive or clandestine ends suggested by the popular usage of the \\"deep state\\" concept.  Popular understanding  In the United States after the 2016 United States presidential election, the term \\"deep state\\" has become much more widely used as pejorative term with an overwhelmingly negative definition by both the new Donald Trump administration as well as the wider news media. In the United States news media and social media usage during the Donald Trump administration, the term deep state has come to be used as an all-purpose scapegoat for elements of the United States federal civil service that the administration opposes. Cases Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russia The Soviet secret police have been frequently described by historians as a \\"state within a state\\". According to Yevgenia Albats, most KGB leaders, including Lavrenty Beria, Yuri Andropov, and Vladimir Kryuchkov, always competed for power with the Communist Party and manipulated communist leaders.Yevgenia Albats and Catherine A. Fitzpatrick (1994), The State Within a State: The KGB and Its Hold on Russia ‚Äì Past, Present, and Future. . According to Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov in 1991, \\"It is not true that the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party is a supreme power. The Political Bureau is only a shadow of the real supreme power that stands behind the chair of every Bureau member ... The real power thinks, acts and dictates for all of us. The name of the power is NKVD‚ÄìMVD‚ÄìMGB. The Stalin regime is based not on the Soviets, Party ideals, the power of the Political Bureau or Stalin's personality, but on the organization and the techniques of the Soviet political police where Stalin plays the role of the first policeman.\\"The Chechen Times ‚Ññ17, 30.08.2003. Translated from \\"Technology of Power\\", 1991, chapter 34 Russian text However, he also noted that \\"To say that NKVD is ‚Äòa state within the state‚Äô means to belittle the importance of the NKVD because this question allows two forces ‚Äì a normal state and a supernormal NKVD ‚Äì whereas the only force is Chekism\\". According to Ion Mihai Pacepa in 2006, \\"In the Soviet Union, the KGB was a state within a state. Now former KGB officers are running the state. They have custody of the country's 6,000 nuclear weapons, entrusted to the KGB in the 1950s, and they now also manage the strategic oil industry renationalized by Putin. The KGB successor, rechristened FSB, still has the right to electronically monitor the population, control political groups, search homes and businesses, infiltrate the federal government, create its own front enterprises, investigate cases, and run its own prison system. The Soviet Union had one KGB officer for every 428 citizens. Putin's Russia has one FSB-ist for every 297 citizens.Jamie Glazov (23 June 2006).

Retrieved 2 October 2019. = Chechnya = According to Julia Ioffe, the Russian Republic of Chechnya, under leadership of Ramzan Kadyrov, has become a state within a state. United Kingdom The Civil Service has been called a \\"deep state\\" by senior politicians in the United Kingdom. Tony Blair said of the Civil Service, \\"You cannot underestimate how much they believe it's their job to actually run the country and to resist the changes put forward by people they dismiss as 'here today, gone tomorrow' politicians. They genuinely see themselves as the true guardians of the national interest, and think that their job is simply to wear you down and wait you out.\\" The efforts of the Civil Service to frustrate elected politicians is the subject of the popular satiric BBC TV comedy, Yes Minister. United States of America In the United States of America, the \\"deep state\\" is used to describe \\"a hybrid association of government elements and parts of top-level industry and finance that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.\\" Alt URL Intelligence agencies such as the CIA have been accused by elements of the Donald Trump administration of attempting to thwart its policy goals. Writing for The New York Times, the analyst Issandr El Amani warned against the \\"growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file\\", while analysts of the column The Interpreter wrote: According to David Gergen, quoted in Time magazine, the term has been appropriated by Steve Bannon and Breitbart News and other supporters of the Trump Administration in order to delegitimize the critics of the current presidency. The 'deep state' theory has been dismissed by authors for The New York Times and New York Observer.  Venezuela  The Cartel of the Suns, a group of high-ranking officials within the Bolivarian Government of Venezuela, has been described as \\"a series of often competing networks buried deep within the Chavista regime\\". Following the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, the Bolivarian government initially embezzled until there were no more funds to embezzle, which required them to turn to drug trafficking. President Hugo Ch√°vez made partnerships with the Colombian leftist militia Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and his successor Nicol√°s Maduro continued the process, promoting officials to high-ranking positions after they were accused of drug trafficking.  Italy  The most famous Italian case is Propaganda Due. Propaganda Due (better known as P2) was a Masonic lodge belonging to the Grand Orient of Italy (GOI). It was founded in 1877 with the name of Masonic Propaganda,Dino P. Arrigo, Fratelli d'Italia. Cronache, storie, riti e personaggi (per capire la Massoneria), Soveria Mannelli, Rubbettino, 1994, p. 45. in the period of its management by the entrepreneur Licio Gelli assumed deviated forms with respect to the statutes of the Freemasonry and subversive towards the Italian legal order. The P2 was suspended by the GOI on 26 July 1976; subsequently, the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the P2 Masonic lodge under the presidency of Minister Tina Anselmi concluded the P2 case denouncing the lodge as a real \\"criminal organization\\"Willan, Puppetmasters, p. 50. and \\"subversive\\". It was dissolved with a special law, the n. 17 of 25 January 1982.

The hybrid political system is divided between an elected parliament and appointed government. Kuwait is among the Middle East's freest countries in civil liberties and political rights. The Constitution of Kuwait was promulgated in 1962. Freedom House rates the country as \\"Partly Free\\" in the Freedom in the World survey. Kuwait is the only one among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf which is ranked \\"partly free\\". Constitution The Constitution of Kuwait was ratified in 1962 and has elements of a presidential and parliamentary system of government. The constitution stipulates that Kuwait must have an elected legislature (the National Assembly parliament). The Emir is the head of state, whose powers are defined in the constitution. Citizens who have reached the age of 21 years can vote. Parliamentary candidates must be eligible to vote and at least 30 years old. The Constitution expressly supports political parties, but they remain illegal as no law has arisen to define and regulate them. MPs tend to serve as independents or as members of de facto political parties and factions based on ideology, sect, social class or clan. Legislative branch (Parliament) The National Assembly is the legislature in Kuwait. The National Assembly has the power to remove government ministers from their post. MPs frequently exercise their constitutional right to interpellate government members. The National Assembly's interpellation sessions of ministers are aired on Kuwaiti TV. MPs also have the right to interpellate the prime minister, and then table a motion of non-cooperation with the government, in which case the cabinet must get replaced. The National Assembly can have up to 50 MPs. Fifty deputies are elected by popular vote to serve four-year terms. Members of the cabinet also sit in the parliament as deputies. The constitution limits the size of the cabinet to 16, and at least one member of the cabinet must be an elected MP. The cabinet ministers have the same rights as the elected MPs, with the following two exceptions: they do not participate in the work of committees, and they cannot vote when an interpolation leads to a no-confidence vote against one of the cabinet members. The Constitutional Court has the authority to dissolve the house and must subsequently call for new elections within two months. The Constitutional Court is widely believed to be one of the most judicially independent courts in the Arab world. The Emir also has the authority to dissolve the house and must call for new elections within two months. The Constitutional Court can invalidate the Emir's decree dissolving the parliament. The National Assembly is the main legislative power in Kuwait. The Emir can veto laws but the National Assembly can override his veto by a two-thirds vote. The National Assembly (per article 4 of the Constitution) has the constitutional right to approve and disapprove of an Emir's appointment. The National Assembly effectively removed Saad al-Sabah from his post in 2006 because of Saad's inability to rule due to illness. Kuwait's National Assembly is the most independent parliament in the Arab world, it is among the strongest parliaments in the Middle East. Executive branch Government The prime minister chooses the cabinet (government). The appointment of a new government requires the approval of the National Assembly. The prime minister is a member of the ruling family and is appointed by the Emir. At least one member of the cabinet must be a deputy who won election to the National Assembly. The 1992 cabinet included six elected members of the National Assembly, the most of any cabinet in Kuwaiti history. The current cabinet has two elected members of the Assembly. The National Assembly has the right to remove government ministers from their post. MPs frequently exercise their constitutional right to interpellate government ministers. The National Assembly's interpellation sessions of ministers are aired on Kuwaiti TV. MPs also have the right to interpellate the prime minister, and then table a motion of non-cooperation with the government, in which case the cabinet must get replaced. Emir The Emir's powers are defined by the 1961 constitution. These powers include appointing the prime minister, who in turn chooses the cabinet (government). The crown prince must be approved by an absolute majority of the members of the National Assembly parliament. If the new crown prince fails to win approval from the National Assembly, the Emir submits the names of three eligible members of the family to the National Assembly, and the National Assembly selects one to be the crown prince. Upon the death of the Emir, the crown prince succeeds. In January 2006, the Kuwaiti parliament voted to remove the ailing Emir Saad from power. He was Emir only briefly, after the death of Emir Jaber al Sabah on January 15, 2006. The cabinet nominated the previous Prime Minister, Sabah Al Sabah, to be elected Emir. He won the majority of the votes in the parliament and then became the 15th Emir of the state. Elections The constitution calls for new elections to be held at a maximum interval of four years (or earlier if the parliament is dissolved). Kuwait has universal adult suffrage for Kuwaiti citizens who are 21 or older. Once elected, many deputies form voting blocs in the National Assembly. Kuwaiti law does not recognize political parties. However, numerous political groups function as de facto political parties in elections, and there are blocs in the parliament. Major de facto political parties include: National Democratic Alliance, Popular Action Bloc, Hadas (Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood), National Islamic Alliance and Justice and Peace Alliance.

Its corporate headquarters are in Scottsdale, Arizona. The company formed when Taylor Woodrow and Morrison Homes joined forces in July, 2007. Taylor Morrison operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Nevada, and Texas, building mid-to- upscale housing as well as first-time and mid-market homes. History Taylor Woodrow was founded in 1921 by Frank Taylor and Jack Woodrow. They built a pair of modest semi- detached houses at 347 and 349 Central Drive, Blackpool. During the twenties, Lord Taylor‚Äôs new company concentrated on providing low- cost, high quality housing in the Lancashire area. In the 1930s, Taylor Woodrow diversified into building temporary hospitals, etc., and thereby moved into general construction. In 1936 Taylor Woodrow entered the Canadian construction market through the acquisition of Monarch Development Corporation, founded in 1917, one of Canada‚Äôs oldest, largest and most diversified real estate companies. In 1953 the company purchased a controlling interest in a newly established business, Monarch Mortgage and Investments Limited, which owned land, apartment complexes, stores, and houses in the Toronto area, and in 1994, entered into the high-rise sector. Between 1945 and 2001 Taylor Woodrow's main operations were in general construction with Taylor Woodrow Homes only being a small part of the Group. Morrison Homes was initially founded in Seattle in 1905 by C.G. Morrison and moved to northern California in 1946. The company built primarily first-time and midmarket home communities in Phoenix, Sacramento, Denver, Fort Myers, Jacksonville, Orlando, Sarasota, Tampa, Austin, and Houston. George Wimpey Plc acquired Morrison Homes in 1984 when it was based in San Francisco, California. George Wimpey's 2001 acquisition of Richardson Homes was later integrated under the Morrison brand. On July 6, 2007, the United Kingdom-based parent companies of Morrison Homes Inc. and Taylor Woodrow Inc. joined. Taylor Woodrow Plc. and George Wimpey Plc. formed a new company, Taylor Wimpey Plc., becoming one of the world's largest home building companies. Morrison Homes joined with Taylor Woodrow as part of the parent company formation. The companies continued to operate under their existing brands until 2008, when they began to operate under the new Taylor Morrison brand. In July, 2011, Taylor Morrison became a wholly owned subsidiary of TMM Holdings Limited Partnership, which is indirectly owned by investment funds separately managed by TPG Capital, Oaktree Capital Management, as well as JH Investments.

Ernst settled in Venezuela in 1861, where he taught at the Central University of Venezuela. He became the most important scientist in the country during the second half of the 19th century and was a key figure in the creation of the Museum of Natural Science and the National Library of Venezuela, where he also served as its director. He developed important scientific works in this country. Also, as a university professor, he had a marked influence on generations of scientists from the second half of the nineteenth century in Venezuela. He is regarded as the founder of the Venezuelan positivist school.  Biography  His parents were Adolf Ernst and Catalina Bischoff. He studied high school in his hometown, and then enrolled at the University of Berlin where he studied natural sciences, pedagogy and modern languages. At this German institution, he met two children of the Venezuelan general Judas Tadeo Pi√±ango, with whom he struck up a warm friendship, who encouraged him to travel to Venezuela. On December 2, 1861, he came to Venezuela from Hamburg. on August 5, 1864, he married Enriqueta Tresselt with whom he had five children. In May 1867, now completely adapted to the Venezuelan life, he founded the Society of Physical and Natural Sciences of Caracas and later the National Museum in 1874. In 1876, he became the director of the National Library, in which he gave institution a big boost. During the government of Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco, he participated in the international exhibitions organization in Vienna (1873), Bremen (1874), Santiago de Chile and Philadelphia (1876). In 1874, at the request of the President, he organized the chair of Natural History at the Central University of Venezuela, where he spread the Lamarck's and Charles Darwin's \\"natural selection\\" theories, which were fundamental in Zoology and Botany. He was the inspiration and founder of positivism in Venezuela, and among his chief disciples were Lisandro Alvarado, Jos√© Gil Fortoul and Rafael Villavicencio. In 1889, the Central University of Venezuela awarded him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, in recognition of his academic work. Ernst developed comprehensive research in botany, zoology and ethnography. He also did work in geography, geology, language, anthropology, Physics, paleontology and archeology. Adolph Ernst carried out important studies in different regions of Venezuela, such as the Caracas valley, Lake Maracaibo, the Andes, the Venezuelan Guayana, the island of La Orchila, the Aroa copper mines and Betijoque diamond mines. He created the precursor of ethnobotany in Venezuela by developing themes such as Historia de la Yuca (1890) and El Banano (1893). The ethnographic and archaeological collections acquired by the National Museum formed the basis for publishing a series of descriptive anthropological works of diverse indigenous groups in the country: Wayuu, Ayamanes, Warao. In relation to his archaeological work, he emphasized work on the Andean region, which specifically described the lytic plaques also known as the \\"Batwing\\". He also provided ethnographic data on Andean Aboriginals and spent time with petroglyphs (1885-1889). One of Adolf Ernst's main merits was his disclosing Venezuelan material to the international scientific societies of the nineteenth century, and publishing their contributions in journals such as Globus, Zeitschrift f√ºr Ethnologie, American Anthropologist and in the Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© du Anthropologie Paris.

Early life Andrew Bucci was born on January 12, 1922 in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was influenced early in his career by Mississippi artist and teacher Marie Hull, with whom he began studying around 1940. Bucci graduated from St. Aloysius High School in Vicksburg in 1938 and earned a degree in architectural engineering from Louisiana State University. After the outbreak of World War II, Bucci enlisted in the United States Army and received training in meteorology at New York University. Bucci served as a weather officer on air bases in England and Scotland during the war. When the war ended, he was stationed for several months at Orly Air Base near Paris and took life-drawing classes at the Acad√©mie Julian in 1945-46. Career After the war, Bucci was hired by the U.S. Weather Bureau to work at its Vicksburg office. In 1947, he enrolled in the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he received a B.F.A. in 1951 and an M.F.A. in 1954. Between degrees he studied fashion illustration at Parsons School of Design (now known as Parsons The New School for Design). In the late 1940s, Bucci was among the original group of artists to exhibit work and teach at Mississippi's first art colony at Allison's Wells Hotel. After a fire destroyed the hotel in 1963, Bucci continued his affiliation with the art colony for a number of years after it regrouped. During the Korean War, Bucci was called back into military service as a weather officer at Lockbourne AFB in Ohio, which was operated by the Strategic Air Command. He served from March 1952 to August 1953, then returned to Chicago to complete his graduate degree. He retired from the military with the rank of major. Bucci spent most of his career in Maryland and the Washington, D.C. area. He worked for the U.S. Weather Bureau's National Meteorological Center in Maryland from 1956 until his retirement in 1979. He exhibited work in numerous D.C.-area galleries and served as president of the Washington Water Color Association from 1963-65. In 1983, Bucci was artist-in-residence for a semester at Delta State University. He had recently resettled in Vicksburg at the time of his death. Bucci designed the 5-cent United States Postal Service stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of Mississippi statehood. The stamp was introduced on December 11, 1967. Bucci was the recipient of the Mississippi Arts Commission 2009 Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts for lifetime achievement in the visual arts and the 2012 Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Lifetime Achievement award. Bucci's painting, \\"Figure in Green,\\" was chosen by the USA International Ballet Competition as the signature image for the 2014 commemorative poster and program. Bucci's paintings have been viewed throughout the South for over half a century, beginning with the Mississippi Art Association in 1947 and including exhibitions at the Lauren Rogers Museum of Art in 1952, 1965, 1979 and 2000. His works have been part of numerous national and regional shows at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Baltimore Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, Pennsylvania Academy of Design and New Orleans Museum of Art, among others. Bucci's works are in numerous collections, including the Arkansas Arts Center, Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, Mississippi Museum of Art, Ogden Museum of Southern Art, Florence Art Gallery and The Johnson Collection in South Carolina, Delta State University, Hinds Community College and Mississippi University for Women. In 2007 Bucci donated a number of materials to the Smithsonian Archives of American Art. The archive includes several of his own works of art, six figure drawings with fellow student H.C. Westermann modeling from a life drawing class at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, 1947‚Äì48; letters, postcards, and handmade holiday cards to Bucci from artists Anna P. Baker, Marie Hull, Dan Flavin, and Hosford Fontaine; and printed material regarding the artists and the Allison's Wells art colony. From May 26 to August 29, 2015, Belhaven University presented \\"Andrew Bucci: Rediscovered,\\" a retrospective exhibition featuring works from Bucci's personal collection, predominantly oil paintings on canvas, spanning from the early 1950s to 2014. A catalogue produced for the exhibition features photographs of Bucci and his artwork by James Patterson. Death Bucci died on November 16, 2014.

Resource Area For Teaching (RAFT) is a nonprofit (501c3) that is pursuing an alternative approach to education. It has been the subject of studies from the Stanford University School of Business, KPMG and Deloitte. It partners with the San Francisco Exploratorium in developing hands-on demonstrations and activities. While the Exploratorium tends to focus on Science-related activities, RAFT keeps its focus on classroom pursuits of a wider subject area, including Science, Mathematics, Art, and Literature. RAFT has three principal social and pedagogical themes: * Many children learn best through the exercise of tactile and kinesthetic senses that are seldom exploited in traditional classroom settings with their emphasis on auditory and visual learning. * Almost all educational institutions in the U.S. have insufficient government funding for materials for the classroom (known as manipulatives), funding for which is often provided by the teacher at his or her own expense. * Materials for classroom learning are often available in industrial and commercial discards, overruns, and restocks, which businesses will gladly re- purpose to aid education. RAFT has retail locations in San Jose, Redwood City and Sacramento, California as well as Denver, Colorado and serves 10,000 teacher members at the four sites.. It also operates a warehouse and volunteer center in Sunnyvale, California. The organization operates on a $4 million annual budget, which is used to operate programs and subsidize material purchases and teacher-training workshops. Funding is provided by a mix of foundation, corporate and personal donations. In 2012, the organization launched an eCommerce website where teacher classroom kits may be purchased online. In 2013, a joint venture with Scholastic began distribution of RAFT- designed kits through the retail stores that carry Scholastic products. The operation includes several divisions: * Logistics is responsible for material acquisition, warehousing and sorting. Most material donations arrive without solicitation, and are picked up by RAFT trucks or delivered to one of the sites. Material sorting is a labor-intensive activity staffed almost entirely by corporate and individual volunteers. * The Education Department is responsible for developing classroom activities that make use of the available materials. This group consists of professional educators who: ** Schedule and staff workshops, ** Create Idea Sheets posted on the RAFT web site, and ** Design classroom kits (assembled by volunteers) for state-standard aligned activities. * Member Services ensures that RAFT identifies its clients as legitimate educators and non-profit employees and volunteers, provides information on programs to this group, and reaches out to the wider education community.

In about 1911, at the age of 18, he moved to Costa Rica where he spent 20 years at farm work, also becoming a member of the Ancient Order of Ethiopia masonic lodge. His background at this time had been with the Ethiopian Baptist Church, founded in Jamaica by the 18th century Baptist preacher George Lisle. Hibbert returned to Jamaica in 1931, starting his ministry, \\"Ethiopian Coptic Faith\\", to teach that the newly crowned Haile Selassie was divine, in St. Andrew Parish, in a district called Benoah. He reached this conclusion independently, having studied the Ethiopic translation of the Bible. Somewhat later, he transferred his ministry to Kingston, where he found that another street preacher named Leonard P. Howell was already teaching many similar doctrines. Like Howell and Dunkley, Hibbert was subjected to arrest and imprisonment by authorities, and he was also a founding member of EWF Local 17. Hibbert was probably among the Rastafari elders, including Mortimer Planno, who were given the honour of meeting with Haile Selassie I on his historic 1966 visit to Jamaica. In 1970, Hibbert formally invited the Archbishop Laike Mandefro, whom Haile Selassie had sent to Jamaica as emissary of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, to teach Rastafarians about the Orthodox Faith, and in about 1971, Mandefro named Hibbert as a \\"Spiritual Organizer\\".Barry Chevannes, \\"The Apotheosis of Rastafari Heroes\\", in Religion, Diaspora and Cultural Identity by John W.

Administration Palwal district comprises 282 villages, 237 gram panchayats, 1 municipal council, 2 municipal committees, 3 sub-divisions, 4 development blocks and 3 tehsils. The sub-divisions are under the control of sub-divisional magistrate while each development block is under the control of a block development and panchayat officer. All the blocks are covered under Swarn Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojna and other developmental programmes. Developmental programmes are overseen by the additional deputy commissioner- cum chief executive officer, DRDA Palwal. The district is under the overall charge of the deputy commissioner who is also the chairman of the District Rural Development Agency. Economy and infrastructure Palwal consists of agricultural and commercial areas, and has many temples, schools, colleges and banks. It also contains developed areas like Housing board colony, New colony, Main market, shivapuri, Krishna colony, kailash nagar, shiv colony, camp colony and Huda sector 2. There is a main chowk () called the Heart of Palwal. The government plans to develop the economy of Palwal in line with nearby cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad,hodal, Khair, Mathura. Forests The Forest Department aims to increase forestation for soil conservation in the district, in line with the National Forests Policy of the Ministry of Environment and Forests. According to the plan, about one-third of the geographical area should be under tree cover. In order to achieve this objective large-scale plantings have been undertaken on community, panchayat, government and private land over the last 20 years. Saplings of eucalypyus, shisham, neem, and other fruit plants were distributed free of costs to farmers to plant in their fields.

Anderson, et al., Civil Action No. 08-11364, was a challenge brought by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to prevent three Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students from publicly presenting a security vulnerability they discovered in the MBTA's Charlie Card automated fare collection system. The case concerns the extent to which the disclosure of a computer security flaw is a form of free speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The MBTA claimed that the MIT students violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and on August 9, 2008, was granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) against the students to prevent them from presenting information to DEFCON conference attendees that could have potentially been used to defraud the MBTA of transit fares. The MIT students contended that submitting their research for review and approval by a government agency before publication is unconstitutional prior restraint. The case garnered considerable popular and press attention when the injunction unintentionally became a victim of the Streisand effect, increasing the dissemination of the sensitive information of the students' presentation because the slides had been both distributed to conference organizers in the weeks before the injunction as well as inadvertently posted to the district court's public website as exhibits to the MBTA's original complaint. On August 19, the judge rejected the MBTA's request to extend the restraining order and the TRO likewise expired, thus granting the students the right to discuss and present their findings. Background In December 2007, cautions were published separately by Karsten Nohl and Henryk Plotz regarding the weak encryption and other vulnerabilities of the particular security scheme as implemented on NXP's MIFARE chip set and contactless electronic card system. In March 2008, articles on the vulnerabilities appeared in newspapers and computer trade journals. A comparable independent cryptanalysis, focused on the MIFARE Classic chip, was performed at the Radboud University Nijmegen. On March 7 the scientists were able to recover a cryptographic key from the RFID card without using expensive equipment. With respect to responsible disclosure the Radboud University Nijmegen published the article six months later. NXP tried to stop the publication of the second article through a preliminary injunction. In the Netherlands, the judge ruled on July 18 that publishing this scientific article falls under the principle of freedom of expression and that in a democratic society it is of great importance that the results of scientific research can be published. In May 2008, MIT students Zack Anderson,Zack Anderson homepage at MIT Russell J. Ryan,Russell J. Ryan homepage Alessandro Chiesa,Alessandro Chiesa page at MIT and Samuel G. McVeety presented a final paper in Professor Ron Rivest's 6.857: Computer and Network Security class demonstrating weaknesses in the MBTA's automated fare collection system. The report identified four problems: the value is stored on the card and not in a secure database, the data on the card can be easily read and overwritten, there is no cryptographic signature algorithm to prevent forgeries, and there is no centralized card verification system. Anderson, Ryan, and Chiesa submitted a presentation entitled \\"Anatomy of a Subway Hack: Breaking Crypto RFID's and Magstripes of Ticketing Systems\\" to the DEF CON hacker convention which claimed to review and demonstrate how to reverse engineer the data on the magstripe card, several attacks to break the MIFARE-based Charlie Card, and brute force attacks using FPGAs. Before the complaint was filed in August 2008, Bruce Schneier wrote on the matter that \\"Publication of this attack might be expensive for NXP and its customers, but it's good for security overall. Companies will only design security as good as their customers know to ask for.\\" Litigation On August 8, 2008, the MBTA filed suit seeking a temporary restraining order, both to prevent the students from presenting or otherwise discussing their findings until its vendors had sufficient time to correct defects and to seek monetary damages. The motion was granted on August 9 by Judge Douglas P. Woodlock and while the students appeared as scheduled, they did not speak or present at the convention. However, the injunction not only garnered more popularity and press attention to the case, but the sensitive information in the students' presentation became even more widely disseminated afterwards (by what is called the Streisand effect) since it had been both distributed to conference organizers in the weeks before the injunction as well as inadvertently posted to the district court's public website as exhibits to the MBTA's original complaint. The MBTA retained Holland & Knight to represent them and contended that under the norm of responsible disclosure, the students did not provide sufficient information or time before the presentation for the MBTA to correct the flaw and further alleged that the students transmitted programs to cause damage to (or attempted to transmit and damage) MBTA computers in an amount in excess of $5,000 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. Furthermore, it was contended that this damage constituted a threat to public health and safety and the MBTA would suffer irreparable harm if the students were allowed to present; that the students converted and trespassed on MBTA property; that the students illegally profited from their activities; and that MIT itself was negligent in supervising the undergraduates and notifying the MBTA.Complaint, pp. 12‚Äì16. The MIT students retained the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Fish & Richardson to represent them and asserted that the term \\"transmission\\" in the CFAA cannot be broadly construed as any form of communication and the restraining order is a prior restraint infringing their First Amendment right to protected free speech about academic research.Response, pp. 9‚Äì17. A letter published by 11 prominent computer scientists on August 11 supported the defendants' assertions and claimed that the precedent of the gag order will \\"stifle research efforts and weaken academic computing research programs. In turn, we fear the shadow of the law's ambiguities will reduce our ability to contribute to industrial research in security technologies at the heart of our information infrastructure.\\"Letter from Computer Science Professors and Computer Scientists, p. 7.

Complex interactions in metacommunities, with implications for biodiversity and higher levels of selection. Ecology, 73: 1984-2000.Leibold, M.A., M. Holyoak, N. Mouquet and others (2004). The metacommunity concept: a framework for multi-scale community ecology. Ecology Letters, 7: 601-613. The term is derived from the field of community ecology, which is primarily concerned with patterns of species distribution, abundance and interactions. Metacommunity ecology combines the importance of local factors (environmental conditions, competition, predation) and regional factors (dispersal of individuals, immigration, emigration) to explain patterns of species distributions that happen in different spatial scales. There are four theoretical frameworks, or unifying themes, that each detail specific mechanistic processes useful for predicting empirical community patterns. These are the patch dynamics, species sorting, source‚Äìsink dynamics (or mass effect) and neutral model frameworks. Patch dynamics models describe species composition among multiple, identical patches, such as islands. In this framework, species are able to persist on patches through tradeoffs in colonization ability and competitive ability, where less competitive species can disperse to unoccupied patches faster than they go extinct in others. Species sorting models describe variation in abundance and composition within the metacommunity due to individual species responses to environmental heterogeneity, such that certain local conditions may favor certain species and not others. Under this perspective, species are able to persist in patches with suitable environmental conditions resulting in a strong correlation between local species composition and the environment. This model represents the classical theories of the niche-centric era of G. Evelyn Hutchinson and Robert MacArthur. Source-sink models describe a framework in which dispersal and environmental heterogeneity interact to determine local and regional abundance and composition. This framework is derived from the metapopulation ecology term describing source‚Äìsink dynamics at the population level. High levels of dispersal among habitat patches allows populations to be maintained in environments that are normally outside the species environmental range. Finally, the neutral perspective describes a framework where species are essentially equivalent in their competitive and dispersal abilities, and local and regional composition and abundance is determined primarily by stochastic demographic processes and dispersal limitation. The neutral perspective was recently popularized by Stephen Hubbell following his groundbreaking work on the unified neutral theory of biodiversity.

Beattie was born in Waterbeck, Scotland. He graduated from Edinburgh University having studied at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow. Soon afterwards he was appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at South African College in Cape Town. He married Elizabeth Paton in 1898. They had two daughters and a son. Their son was killed while serving with the Royal Air Force in 1942. For his contributions to education in South Africa, he was knighted in 1920. He died in Cape Town. Life John Carruthers Beattie was born on 21 November 1866, in Dumfriesshire. He attended St John's Boarding School in Workington and Moray House in Edinburgh. He entered the University of Edinburgh and obtained a degree in Chemistry, Botany and Mathematics before furthered his studies in Physics at Munich, Vienna, Berlin and Glasgow (under Lord Kelvin). In 1896 he was awarded a Doctorate of Science from the University of Edinburgh for his thesis entitled The Behaviour of Bismuth Plates in a Steady Magnetic Field. He married Elizabeth Paton in 1898. He died in Cape Town in South Africa. University career In 1897 Beattie was appointed as Professor of Applied Mathematics and Experimental Physics at the South African College in Cape Town. Beattie‚Äôs research included the influence of X-rays, ultra-violet light, and the rays from uranium on the electrical conductivity of gases, and the leakage of electricity from charged bodies at moderate temperatures. During the Anglo-Boer War in February 1899, he and others demonstrated the application of wireless telegraphy by transmitting signals over a distance of 120 metres on Cape Town's Grand Parade using equipment imported from Britain. In 1901 he began a magnetic survey of South Africa with Prof John Todd Morrison. Starting in 1908 he extended the survey through central Africa to Egypt, arriving in Cairo in December 1909. Beginning in 1904 there was a movement to obtain a charter for both the University of Cape Town and the University of Stellenbosch. Alfred Beit, a mining magnate and one of Cecil John Rhodes' collaborators, died in 1906 leaving a bequest of ¬£200 000 for the creation of a university in Johannesburg. The then government though had a preference for Rhodes's idea of establishing a university in Cape Town on his former estate. The Beit trustees were then persuaded to allow the Beit Bequest to rather be used to pursue Rhodes's dream and additionally to contribute a further ¬£300 000. Establishing a new university adjacent to South African College would then have inhibited its further development. Seeing an opportunity, Beattie became involved in the ‚Äòaudacious bid‚Äô to develop South African College into this new national university. He succeeded, despite strong opposition from people in Johannesburg who wished to establish the university there, and the Beit's Bequest was subsequently used to establish the University of Cape Town. Beattie in 1917 was appointed Principal of the South African College, abandoning his academic research. In 1918 he was appointed the first Vice- Chancellor and Principal of the University of Cape Town, which he held till his retirement at the end of 1937. He was responsible for the establishment of the campus on the slopes of Table Mountain. The move to the present-day campus took place between 1928 and 1929. This helped establish the reputation of the university, opening of new departments and greatly increasing in the number of students from about 600 in 1918 to 2200 in 1938. Awards Beattie was a member of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society, joining in November 1891. He was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 1 March 1897, his proposers being Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Peter Guthrie Tait, Alexander Crum Brown and Cargill Gilston Knott. He was a member of the South African Philosophical Society and was elected as President for the 1905-6 session. In 1910 he was awarded by the South African Association for the Advancement of Science the South Africa Medal and Grant; he was President of Section A of the Association in that year and President of the Association in 1928. In 1920 he was knighted for his services to education. Honorary degrees were conferred on him by the Universities of the Witwatersrand, Edinburgh, and Cape Town. The citation for the Honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh on 2 July 1927 reads: His numerous public activities included membership of the Board of Trustees of the South African Public Library, Cape Town (Chairman for several years), membership of the Scientific and Industrial Research Committee of the Union of South Africa and Vice-Chairman of the South African Broadcasting Board from 1937 to 1943.

All trams of this type were built by the Finnish tram manufacturer Karia in 1959. The first trams of this type were withdrawn from service in 1993. As of 2008 six trams (numbers 9, 11-14 and 175) remain in operational condition. Of these, two have been extensively repaired and are occasionally used in normal service (numbers 9 and 12), one has been converted into a restaurant tram (former no. 15, now no. 175 \\"Sp√•rakoff\\") and one is used as a non-passenger carrying advertisement tram (no. 14). Concept and construction The HM V type trams, alongside the near-identical RM 3 type produced at the same time by Valmet, were the last development in a series of five near-identical tram types produced by Karia and Valmet for operations on the Helsinki and Turku tram network during the 1950s (the previous types being HM IV and RM 1 for Helsinki and RM 2 for Turku). HKL ordered the HM V type trams from Karia, a subsidiary company of Suomen Autoteollisuus, in 1957. The series designation stands for Helsingin moottorivaunu, viides sarja (). Karia built the bodies and assembled the trams, while Sisu (another subsidiary company of Suomen Autoteollisuus) supplied the bogies and Str√∂mberg the electronics. Service history The first HM V tram, number 1, was delivered to the HKL on 27 April 1959, with number 15 delivered last in the series on 23 October 1959. Coinciding with the delivery of these new trams the HKL had decided to reset their numbering scheme. Therefore, the HM V trams were numbered starting from one and not from 376, as they would have been had the old numbering been continued. The HM V trams were built to be compatible with the HP II type trailers that had been constructed in 1958-59, also by Karia. The usage of trailers in Helsinki ended in 1983, although the couplers needed for hauling trailers were retained in the HM V type trams for many years afterwards, number 14 being the last tram to have one, with the coupler removed only in 2006.P√∂lh√∂, Pyk√§l√§-Aho (1996). p. 194. Originally the HM V trams were built to be operated by two people, with a separate driver and conductor. Between 1978 and 1982 they were converted to one-person operations, with the driver also acting as the ticket seller. HM V number 175 \\"Sp√•rakoff\\", at Mikonkatu tram stop in Rautatientori. The first HM V units to be withdrawn from service were numbers 5 and 6, withdrawn in 1993, with number 7 following in 1994. In 1994 work also begun on converting number 15 into a pub tram. These works were completed in 1995, when number 15 was renumbered into number 175 in honour of the 175th anniversary of the Sinebrychoff brewery, who also paid the conversion work of the tram. In addition to be being renumbered, the tram was named Sp√•rakoff (from Helsinki slang ', tram, and \\"Koff\\", a beer brand brewed by Sinebrychoff). Also during 1995 number 11 was rebuilt as a \\"NAC prototype\\" by ABB, with new traction motors and control devices. During the latter half of the 1990s HKL ordered 40 low-floor Variotrams, which were projected to replace the HM V and RM 3 types in their entirety. During the early 2000s three HM V trams were withdrawn from service, with number 4 withdrawn in 2000, and numbers 1 and 2 during the following year. However, due to persistent technical problems of the Variotrams, some other units in the class remained in service. In 2004-05 number 12 was in Tallinna Trammi- ja Trollibussikoondis (TTTK) depot in Tallinn for large-scale repair/renovation process. Similar renovation were carried out at TTTK on number 9 in 2005-07\\\\. Number 11 received smaller-scale renovation in 2007. While these three trams were restored, numbers 3, 8 and 10 were withdrawn from service in 2006-07, leaving six HM V trams in existence. Liveries Originally all HM V trams were painted in the traditional yellow/green livery used in HKL trams, with the top half of the carriage painted yellow and the bottom half green. In 1995 on conversion into the Sp√•rakoff pub tram, number 175, ex-15, received a new all-red livery advertising Koff beer. Numbers 8, 9 and 15 had occasionally been used as advertisement trams during the 1990s, and from 2005 onwards number 14 has been used as an advertisement tram, covered entirely in adverts of various companies. During the extensive repairs at TTTK in Tallinn, number 9 and 12 have been painted with a modified version of the original livery, with added silver decorative stripes; one running between the yellow and green fields, and another near the bottom of the carriage. Interior layout and design In the original interior layout with a separate conductor and driver the HM V trams had capacity of 29 seated passengers and 69 standing passengers. During the rush hour this could be exceeded by an additional 50 standing passengers. On conversion to one-person operation during the late 1970s and early 80s, the conductor's seat was replaced with two additional seats, bringing the seating capacity up to 31, while the standing capacity was downsized to 57 plus an additional 44 during the rush hour. Following conversion into the Sp√•rakoff, tram number 175 (ex-15) has a capacity of 24 all-seated passengers. Names The nicknames ', ', ' and ' have been used the HM V trams. Below are some of the explanations that have been offered for these nicknames. * ' (\\"stick-\\") and ' (\\"stick-\\")‚Äîreportedly after the stick- like controlling device in the trams combined with the name and location of the manufacturer in Karis. * ' (roughly \\"thing from Laihia\\"), ' (joint of )‚Äîin Finnish folklore, the inhabitants of the municipality of Laihia are believed to be extreme misers, while an articulated tram is in Finnish referred to as ', literally \\"jointed tram\\". These nicknames are said to refer to the changes made to the trams when they were converted to one-person operations.

The award recognized four people or groups for their commitment to innovation, renewal, and a pioneering spirit through political, economic, and cultural activities. The award consisted of a small statue resembling the quadriga atop the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Werkstatt Deutschland presented the award annually on German Unity Day, which commemorates German reunification in 1990. The award was presented by prominent individuals, including Viktor Yushchenko, Bernard Kouchner, and Mikhail Gorbachev. History The award was first given in 2003. For the first two years, the award ceremony took place at Konzerthaus Berlin. From 2005 until 2008, the ceremony was held at Komische Oper Berlin opera house. In 2009, the award ceremony was hosted at the seat of the Foreign Office of Germany. The announcement that Vladimir Putin would receive the award in 2011 was widely condemned. As a result of protests by Quadriga board members and former recipients, the 2011 awards and ceremonies were cancelled. Likewise, the Quadriga was not awarded in 2012.

The announcement that Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin would be awarded the prize led to a public outcry. Quadriga board members Cem √ñzdemir of the German Green Party, Jimmy Wales of Wikipedia, and Heidelberg University history professor Edgar Wolfrum stepped down in protest. Wales is noted as \\"¬´–í–∏–∫–∏–ø–µ–¥–∏–∏¬ª –î–∂–∏–º–º–∏ –£—ç–π–ª—Å\\" (as: \\"Wikipedia\\" Jimmy Wales). Former recipients Olafur Eliasson and V√°clav Havel decided to return their awards. The New York Times commented that from the volume of outcry the ranks of people feeling Putin, a former East Germany-assigned KGB agent and later chief, had rolled back democracy and human rights in Russia are apparently quite large. The organisers decided not to make any awards in 2011 as a result of the controversy. They released a statement on 16 July 2011 saying they acted \\"in light of the growing and unbearable pressure and the danger of further escalation\\" and that they deeply regretted hearing news of Havel's decision.

Generalizations A generalized definition takes the continuant with respect to three sequences a, b and c, so that K(n) is a polynomial of a1,...,an, b1,...,bn‚àí1 and c1,...,cn‚àí1. In this case the recurrence relation becomes : K_0 = 1 ; \\\\, : K_1 = a_1 ; \\\\, : K_n = a_n K_{n-1} - b_{n-1}c_{n-1} K_{n-2} . \\\\, Since br and cr enter into K only as a product brcr there is no loss of generality in assuming that the br are all equal to 1. The extended continuant is precisely the determinant of the tridiagonal matrix : \\\\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ c_1 & a_2 & b_2 & \\\\ldots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & c_2 & a_3 & \\\\ldots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & a_{n-1} & b_{n-1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & c_{n-1} & a_n \\\\end{pmatrix} .

MCT was founded in 2000 to develop ideas of tidal power developed by Peter Fraenkel, who had previously been a founder partner of IT Power,IT Power website a consultancy established to further the development of sustainable energy technologies. The company is based in Bristol and employed 15 people in 2007. By 2003, MCT had installed a 300 kW experimental tidal turbine northeast of Lynmouth, Devon and by 2008 they had a 1.2 MW turbine, SeaGen, in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland which was able to feed electricity into the National Grid. They now have contracts to install a full tidal farm in the Skerries, off northwest Wales and projects in the Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In February 2012 Siemens acquired a majority share in the company, raising its holding from 45% to over 90%. MCT was wholly owned by Siemens, as part of the Hydro and Ocean Business, before being transferred to the Renewables business and finally divested to Atlantis resources who effectively shut the company down.http://www.londonstockexchange.com/exchange/news/market-news/market-news- detail/ARL/12615643.htmlhttp://www.businessgreen.com/bg/news/2406241/siemens- offloads-marine-current-turbines-to-atlantis-resources Technology The technology developed by MCT works much the same as a submerged windmill, driven by the flow of water rather than air. Tidal flows are more predictable than air flows both in time and maximum velocity and it is therefore possible to bring designs closer to the theoretical maximum. The turbines have a patented feature by which they can take advantage of the reversal of flow every 6 hours and generate on both flow and ebb of the tide. The tips of the blades are well below the surface so will not be a danger to shipping or be vulnerable to storms. Because the blades are relatively slow moving (15 rpm)and there are only two, it is considered unlikely that there will be adverse environmental impacts on fish or other aquatic life, and a monitoring project has been set up in the Strangford Lough project to confirm this. Two approaches are being followed, one for relatively shallow waters, up to , and the other for deeper waters. In shallow waters, the turbines are suspended on a tower which extends above the surface of the water and enables the turbines to be lifted clear of the water for maintenance purposes. But since the number of sites around the world where this is possible is finite, they are also developing fully submersed systems which will take advantage of larger scale, but will also be able to be brought to the surface for maintenance. Deep water technology SeaFlow SeaFlow with its rotors raised The SeaFlow project involved building a full-size prototype capable of producing 300 kW. This was installed off the Devon coast near Lynmouth in May 2003. It was the largest tidal turbine operating until SeaGen started. SeaGen SeaGen was a full- scale tidal flow power station that produced electricity on 14 July 2008. However, subsequently a computer problem caused damage to one of the rotors and procuring a replacement took until towards the end of October 2008. However SeaGen was able to operate using just its good rotor through the summer of 2008 and that rotor was operated at full rated power of 600 kW for many hours. After replacement of the damaged rotor SeaGen delivered its full rated power of 1.2MW for the first time on 18 December 2008 - believed to be the first time a \\"wet renewable energy system\\" has delivered in excess of 1MW. Skerries Tidal Stream Array In a proposed joint project with RWE Npower Renewables, 7 of the SeaGen generators, producing about 10MW at peak, would be installed off the Skerries, a patch of very fast moving water off Anglesey in northwest Wales. An environmental consent application was submitted to the Welsh Government in March 2011, though financing still needs to be finalised. Canada An agreement has been made with Canada's Maritime Tidal Energy Corporation in 2007 to develop tidal resources in the Bay of Fundy.Agreement with MTEC With a tidal range exceeding , and flows of up to , this area has long been favoured as the most promising source of tidal power and the newer tidal flow concepts mean that the associated shipping and environmental problems of barrage schemes are no longer prohibitive. MTEC concluded that MCT had the most proven technology of the companies evaluated.Arrangement with Maritime Tidal Energy Corporation On the west coast, they have also agreed to install at least three 1.2 MW turbines in the Campbell River in British Columbia as a first step in developing tidal farms in that river and other tidal waters.

In 2008, he was promoted to the Patriots' assistant director of college scouting. In 2009, he was promoted to the position of Director of College Scouting for the New England Patriots, a position that he held until 2013. Tampa Bay Buccaneers In 2013, Robinson took the position of Director of Player Personnel for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Tennessee Titans Robinson in 2018 On January 14, 2016, Robinson was hired as the general manager of the Tennessee Titans. He improved on the Titans 2015 record, an abysmal 3-13, to 9-7 in 2016. They barely missed the playoffs after a Week 16 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. On January 5, 2017, Robinson, while retaining his general manager position, was promoted to executive vice president. In 2017, the Titans once again went 9-7, but made the playoffs for the first time since 2008.

After beating the Patriots in the Wild Card and heavily upsetting the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round, the Titans lost to the Chiefs 35-24 in the AFC Championship. During his tenure as general manager, Robinson has drafted 29 players. Two of which, running back Derrick Henry and safety Kevin Byard, have made Pro Bowls. Since then, three of Robinson‚Äôs free agent/trade acquisitions have also made Pro Bowls; those being running back DeMarco Murray, safety Brynden Trawick for special teams, and quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Robinson is generally viewed very favorably by Titans fans for his successful tenure with the team. He is commonly referred to as JRob by the fans.

It was built between 1909 and 1911, by popular subscription, to house the Spanish Royal Family. Built by the architects Javier Gonz√°lez Riancho and Gonzalo Bringas Vega, is located in the place where the old Fort of San Salvador de Hano was, which protected the entrance to the bay. History Entrance for carriages (right half of the northwest elevation) Construction of the palace was initiated in 1908 by the local government of Santander for the purpose of providing a seasonal residence for the royal family of Spain. Funding was provided via popular subscription of the local populace. The design and construction of the palace were overseen by architects Javier Gonz√°lez de Riancho and Gonzalo Bringas Vega, with construction completed in 1912. King Alfonso XIII and his family first arrived at the Palacio de la Magdalena on August 4, 1913, and returned annually to summer at the palace through 1930. The royal family used the palace as a base for numerous recreational and sporting activities, and the king sometimes also held government meetings at the property. The annual trips ended with the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. Beginning in 1932, the palace was used to host summer courses through the Men√©ndez Pelayo International University. In 1977 Don Juan de Borb√≥n sold the palace and the peninsula back to the city of Santander, which had previously given it as a gift to the royal family, for 150 million pesetas. The palace, which was declared an historical monument in 1982 and renovated between 1993 and 1995, continues to be used as a conference and meeting hall today. It is the most visited place in the city of Santander. Design The building has an eclectic style, combining English, French, and regional styles. It has two entrances, one on the north side for carriages, with a Porte-coch√®re, and another to the south, which is the main entrance. The south entrance features two octagonal towers and double staircase tranches. The building is covered with stone masonry slate. The highlight of the interior is the reception rooms, which hold paintings of interest by artists such as Luis Benedito, Joaqu√≠n Sorolla y Bastida, and Fernando Alvarez Sotomayor. The stables were designed by Javier Gonz√°lez de Riancho. They emulate a medieval English village with sharp roofs of steep slopes and wooden tiles. After summer courses were started, the stables were converted to student dormitories. The palace is also used in external shots for the Spanish TV series Gran Hotel.

The school is owned and operated by the Cognita Group. Colchester High is the only coeducational independent school in Colchester to offer secondary education.  History  The school was a girls' school only when it opened in 1882. It took boys from 1910, with the first Principal, Mr. Groene, stoutly refusing all approaches by the County Education Committee to incorporate the School into its education remit. It has pursued its independent course ever since, despite a spell as a hospital annexe from 1917 to 1918 and being strafed in 1941. For many years the school was family owned. In 2005, it was bought by Cognita, the largest independent schools business in the UK. The school is still affectionately known by many of the Old pupils from before it became co-educational as the \\"Boys'\\" or \\"Boys' High\\".  The school today  The school admits pupils aged 2 1/2 to 16 from a wide catchment area including Colchester, Braintree, Marks Tey, Coggeshall, Kelvedon, Tiptree, Maldon, and Wivenhoe. Entry is normally at ages 2 1/2‚Äì15. Children are able to join at other ages if there is a vacancy. Younger children spend an informal morning at the school whilst entry to the Senior School from the Juniors is via an Entrance assessment, often held in March. Admission is on the basis of interview and/or assessment, but pupils will not be disadvantaged by the school by virtue of gender, race, background or religion. The 2008 GCSE results for the school were at a high standard, making Colchester High one of the top ranking schools in Essex. Class sizes are typically with approx 16‚Äì18 in a class, although this has grown recently. The school has an 'Old Boys and Girls Association' which all Old Colcestrians are eligible to join once they have left the school, often after their exam year. Membership of the OBGA allows the members to wear the association tie and attend the \\"social events\\" of the year. The school has four houses: Normans (Royal Blue); Saxons (Old Gold); Romans (Red); and Danes (Forest Green). Each house has two senior pupils who act as a Captain of the House and a Sports Captain. The school has traditionally tried to place pupils in the same house as any relatives who have attended the school before them. The school plays several sports during school 'Games', they are mainly: Rugby; Football; Cross Country; Hockey; Athletics; and Cricket. During each Year's PE lessons the main sports are Badminton; Indoor Cricket; Darts; Circuit Training; Volleyball and Basketball.

He was serving as Deputy Inspector-General of Police of Range I, when he was implicated as one of the leaders of the attempted military coup of 1962. Education Dissanayake was educated at Royal College, Colombo and at Ceylon University College where he was an active sportsman. Career He joined the Ceylon Police Force as a Probationary Assistant Superintendent of Police in the Ceylon Police Force in June 1934. Having completed his service examinations, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of Police, Galle in June 1936; Colombo District (North) in February 1937 before undergoing training at Hendon Police College in 1939. On his return in November 1939, he was appointed Assistant Superintendent of Police, Chilaw; Kegalle in December 1941; Colombo Division (North) in May 1942; Avissawella in August 1942; Gampaha in August 1943. In April 1945, he was appointed Acting Superintendent of Police of the Eastern and North-Central Provinces and was confirmed in June 1946. In August 1946 he took over as Superintendent of Police, Kandy; May 1947 of Sabaragamuwa; November 1948 of Western Province (North) and in January 1950 Superintendent of Police, Colombo. In 1950 he underwent a course in Traffic Control in India. In 1953, he was appointed Acting Deputy Inspector-General of Police of Range I and later confirmed. He was in this position during the Hartal 1953 and during riots of 1958. During police serviced he received the Ceylon Police Medal for Meritorious Service, Defence Medal 1939-45, Ceylon Police Independence Medal and the Service Medal of the Order of St John. In 1959, when Inspector General of Police Osmund de Silva was sent on compulsorily retirement by Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike for refusing to carryout orders which Osmund de Silva considered unlawful, DIG Dissanayake was next in line for the post of Inspector General of Police based on the seniority list. Bandaranaike however appointed M. Walter F. Abeykoon, a civil servant instead. Dissanayake tendered his resignation, but it was later withdrawn. Coup As member of the Christian elite, who ever being deprived of the influence they once had due to the Sihinalaisation process started by Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and carried on by Sirimavo Bandaranaike, several disgruntled Christian officers of the army, navy and police began to plot a coup similar to that of General Ayub Khan. The coup members intended to carry out the coups d'√©tat at midnight 27 January 1962 under the instigation of J.F.D. Liyanage of the Ceylon Civil Service and leadership of Colonel F. C. de Saram and C.C. Dissanayake. Colonel de Saram, who would command the military units of the corp and C.C. Dissanayake the police units. The plan was to use troops from the Ceylon Artillery and several other volunteer units along with scout cars of the Ceylon Armoured Corps and policemen to detain the Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike at Temple Trees (the official residence of the prime minister) and round up cabinet ministers, the Permanent Secretary for Defence and External affairs, the Inspector General of Police, DIG (Director of CID), SP (CID) and the acting Navy Commander. The Army Commander were to be restrained too. Colombo placed under curfew and cut off from regular army units based at the Panagoda Cantonment. After the coup members gain control, the newly-self appointed Major-General F. C. De Saram, General Officer Commanding Ceylon, was to command all Military establishments and would have the Governor general Sir Oliver Goonetilleke to dissolve parliament. C.C. Dissanayake would become acting Inspector General of Police. However one of the plotters, SP of Colombo Stanley Senanayake who was brought into the plot that morning by Dissanayake warned the government and all the plotters were arrested. Since no actual coup had happen the government was determined to punish the accused and with the cabinet carrying out the investigation instead of the police, had them confined to solitary confinement in hope of getting a confession. Finlay F. C. de Saram did make a confession, taking all blame for the coup that would become the prosecutions main article of evidence. Dissanayake made no confession, however the day after his arrest he was removed of his post in the police. On 3 June 1963, he was convicted with 11 others out of the 24 accused and sentenced to 10 years in jail and confiscation of property after laws had been modified the government in order to convicted the plotters. The conviction was overruled on appeal to the Privy Council, which ruled that the new Act had denied fair trial, since the new laws only effect the accused. Family He and his wife had two daughters and a son. His son T.D.S.A. Dissanayake became a Sri Lanka and UN diplomat going on to become Sri Lankan Ambassador to Indonesia and Egypt. The current Colombo district Member of Parliament Ravi Karunanayake is his grandson. His brother was DIG S.A. Dissanayake, who was the Director of the Criminal Investigation Department, he was on the list of those to be arrested during the coup, but in turn played a pivotal role in stopping the coup. S. A.

Their repertoire consists of shows for both adults and children.  History  The puppet theatre was founded in 1990 as a professional freelance touring company by the name of \\"Tristans Kompagnons\\". In 2006 the puppeteers changed the name of the theatre to Thalias Kompagnons. From 1997 to 2008 they ran the Nuremberg \\"Theater der Puppen im KaLi\\" in partnership with the \\"Theater Salz & Pfeffer\\". They give guest performances all around the world, and their work has been awarded several prizes, e.g. the Preis der Stadt N√ºrnberg for art and science in 2008.  Ensemble  Joachim Torbahn studied art in Vienna and worked as set-designer for several opera houses and theatres. He has been designing the stage sets and puppets for Thalias Kompagnons since 1990; since 1998 he has also been working as a puppeteer for the theatre. Tristan Vogt studied German literature and sociology; since 1990 he has been working full- time as puppeteer, author and director. Both members of the ensemble give guest lectures at the Ernst Busch School for Performing Arts (in the puppet- show department) in Berlin.  Classification  The productions of Thalias Kompagnons represent mixtures of puppetry, drama and music theatre. They generally belong to the genre of puppet theatre, which makes use of the dramatic technique of animation. With their painting-theatre productions ‚Äì live painting to music ‚Äì Thalias Kompagnons created a special synthesis of art and theatre: as the puppeteer tells a story which, like his painting, develops and changes, he simultaneously demonstrates the techniques of painting. Thalias Kompagnons were influenced by the Ernst Busch School. They treat the traditions of folk drama with affectionate irony and often play with the conventions of the classic German \\"Kasperle-Theater\\" show. Apart from playing with hand puppets on a fourth-wall stage, the actor-puppeteers are actually seen on stage making use of other playing materials as well (e.g. masks, table puppets, simple objects, video projections).

Salomea was the daughter of Leszek I the White, who was the Duke of Krak√≥w and thus the High Duke in Poland, and his wife Grzymis≈Çawa of ≈Åuck (or Lutsk). She was the older sister of Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste. Her marriage to K√°lm√°n, who was the son of King Andr√°s or Andrew II of Hungary, was negotiated when she was about three. Since her mother had ancestral connections to the lands of Galicia, and both her father and King Andrew wanted to dominate that area, this plan seemed to meet the needs of both parties. The marriage of Salomea and K√°lm√°n, who was seven at the time, occurred in 1215. In 1219 their control in Galicia was ended and for a time they were taken as prisoners. After their release they returned to Hungary and lived in Szepes, now Spi≈° in the nation of Slovakia. In 1226 K√°lm√°n was named Duke of Slavonia by his father, and he took responsibility for the rule of Slavonia, Croatia, and Dalmatia. He died in 1241 from wounds suffered at the Battle of Mohi during the Mongol invasion of Europe. In 1245 the widowed Salomea joined the Order of Poor Ladies and founded a monastery in Zawichost in which to live as nuns according to the Rule of Saint Clare. Because of the danger of a Mongol invasion into Poland, Salomea and the other Poor Ladies moved westward from Zawichost in March 1257, and relocated to Ska≈Ça (or Grodzisko), north of Krak√≥w. Salomea was considered saintly and it was said that she had preserved her chastity in marriage. She was beatified in 1672 by Pope Clement X.

This category encompasses over 600 different conditions, including genetic disorders, infections, cancer, seizure disorders (such as epilepsy), conditions with a cardiovascular origin (such as stroke), congenital and developmental disorders (such as spina bifida), and degenerative disorders (such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).  Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms can vary depending on the condition. Given the significance of the nervous system in human physiology, symptoms can involve other organ systems and result in motor dysfunction, sensory impairment, pain, etc.  Causes  Genetic  Some nervous system diseases are due to genetic mutations. For example, Huntington's disease is an inherited disease characterized by progressive neurodegeneration. Huntington's disease results from a mutation in either copy of the HTT gene, which results in an abnormally folded protein. The accumulation of mutated proteins results in brain damage of the basal ganglia.  Congenital/developmental defect  Developing babies can suffer from birth defects that affect the formation of the nervous system. For example, Anencephaly (or spina bifida) causes abnormalities in the nervous system due to neural tube defects. Cancer This figure illustrates how glioblastoma affects brain tissue. Specialized cells in the central nervous system, such as glial cells, may proliferate abnormally and form gliomas. Glioblastoma is an aggressive form of glioma. Infection Pathogens like fungi, bacteria, and viruses can affect the nervous system. For example, meningitis is a common infection of the central nervous system, where bacterial or viral infections cause an inflammation of the meninges. Seizure disorder It is suspected that seizures occur because of synchronized brain activity. Epilepsy, for example, is characterized by an abnormal electrical activity in the brain, which causes repeated seizures. Vascular The brain is rich in blood vessels because it requires a lot of nutrients and oxygen. A stroke may result from a blood clot or hemorrhage.  Degenerative  This diagram shows the myelin sheath around axons of healthy neurons looks like, and the result of demyelination of neurons in Multiple Sclerosis. A neurodegenerative disease is a disease that causes damage to neurons. Examples of neurodegenerative disease include Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. For example, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disease, where the body initiate an inflammatory reaction in the central nervous system, and causes damage to neurons. Neurodegneration is different in each disease, for example, MS is a result of a degenerative process called demyelination. On the other hand, Parkinson's Disease results from damage of neurons in the Substantia Nigra, which is important to initiate motor behavior.  Anatomy  Central nervous system (CNS) According to Tim Newman, the central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord, it collects information from the entire body and it also controls functions throughout the entire body. =Brain= Newman's research also shows that the brain is the most complex organ in the entire body. The brain is split up into 4 lobes: the temporal, parietal the occipital, and the frontal The brain has over 100 billion neurons and it uses about 20% of the body's oxygen. =Spinal cord= The spinal cord runs through most of the back. The spinal cord contains a total of 31 spinal nerves in between each vertebrae. The nerves connect to the peripheral nervous system. Peripheral nervous system The peripheral nervous system connects to the muscles and glands and sends information to the central nervous system.  Diagnosis  There are a number of different tests that can be used to diagnose neurological disorders. Lumbar puncture A lumbar puncture (LP), also known as a spinal tap, is a procedure where a hollow needle is inserted into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, allowing for the collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for collection and subsequent analysis. Red and white blood cell counts, protein and glucose levels, and the presence of abnormal cells or pathogens such as bacteria and viruses can all be screened for. The opacity and color of the fluid can also yield useful information that can assist in a diagnosis.  Treatments The treatments for nervous system disorders varies depending on the condition, and can include interventions such as medication, surgery, and therapy.

It is utilizing high-efficiency, crystalline PV panels designed and manufactured by SunPower. The project includes up to 88,000 SunPower solar tracking devices to hold PV panels that track the sun across the sky. Project overview The project began construction in 2011, and began operation in 2012 with 22 MW completed. It was fully completed in October 2013. At the time it was completed, \\"the California Valley Solar Ranch will power about 100,000 homes and will be one of the largest photovoltaic (PV) solar power plants in the world\\". The project is being constructed on of a site of former grazing land. It is utilizing high-efficiency, crystalline PV panels designed and manufactured by SunPower. The project includes up to 88,000 SunPower solar tracking devices to hold PV panels that track the sun across the sky. The project delivers approximately 550 gigawatt-hours (GW¬∑h) annually of renewable energy and has a capacity of 250 MW. While the plant only has a capacity factor of 25%, its power is generated during the middle of the day, when demand for electricity -- and price -- is much higher than at night. Power Purchase Agreement On August 14, 2008, Pacific Gas and Electric announced an agreement to buy all the power from the power plant. A Conditional Use Permit application for the project was filed with the County of San Luis Obispo Planning and Building Department on January 14, 2009. On November 30, 2010, NRG Energy announced that it would buy CVSR from SunPower for \\"up to $450 million\\". In September 2011, the Department of Energy (DOE) offered NRG Solar a $1.237 billion loan from the federal government to cover most of the construction cost. The total cost of the project is estimated to be $1.6 billion. Environment The Carrizo Plain is home to 13 species listed as endangered either by the state or federal government, including the San Joaquin kit fox, giant kangaroo rat, and the California condor. SunPower worked with the community to protect local wildlife habitat and migration patterns, and reduced the amount of traffic in the area during construction.SunPower Adds 40-MW to California Valley Solar Ranch Renewable Energy World, 3 May 2010.

At least five subspecies are currently recognized. Description Most western terrestrial garter snakes have a yellow, light orange, or white dorsal stripe, accompanied by two stripes of the same color, one on each side. Some varieties have red or black spots between the dorsal stripe and the side stripes. It is an immensely variable species, and even the most experienced herpetologists have trouble when it comes to identification. They are medium-sized snakes, usually . Like many species of North American garter snake, the western terrestrial garter snake possesses a mildly venomous saliva. Specimens collected from Idaho and Washington produced venom with myonecrotic (muscle tissue-killing) effects when injected into the gastrocnemius muscles of mice. Several cases of mild human envenomation with local edema and other symptoms (but without any systemic symptoms) have occurred from the wandering garter snake subspecies, including in Colorado. This species is the only garter snake species with a well-documented tendency to constrict prey, although the constriction is inefficient when compared with the constriction of many other snakes (such as the gopher snake), involving disorganized, loose, and sometimes unstable coils and a longer time required to kill prey. Snakes from Colorado populations of terrestrial garter snakes appear to be more efficient at killing their prey by constriction than those from Pacific Coast populations. Geographic range Thamnophis elegans is found in central British Columbia, central Alberta, and southwestern Manitoba in Canada. As well in the western United States, as far east as western Nebraska and the Oklahoma Panhandle. An isolated population occurs in Baja California, Mexico. Subspecies Thamnophis elegans terrestris with dark coloring Six subspecies have been identified, although the validity of some of them is debated. *Thamnophis elegans arizonae Tanner & Lowe, 1989 ‚Äì Arizona garter snake *Thamnophis elegans elegans (Baird & Girard, 1853) ‚Äì mountain garter snake *Thamnophis elegans hueyi Van Denburgh & Slevin, 1923 ‚Äì San Pedro M√°rtir garter snake *Thamnophis elegans terrestris Fox, 1951 ‚Äì coastal garter snake *Thamnophis elegans vagrans (Baird & Girard, 1853) ‚Äì wandering garter snake *Thamnophis elegans vascotanneri Tanner & Lowe, 1989 ‚Äì Upper Basin garter snake Habitat Thamnophis elegans occurs in a wide variety of habitats, including grasslands, woodlands, and coniferous forests, from sea level up to . It is primarily terrestrial, although populations in the Great Basin and Rocky Mountains are semi-aquatic. Reproduction The western terrestrial garter snake does not lay eggs, but instead is ovoviviparous, which is characteristic of natricine snakes. Broods of eight to 12 young are born in August and September.Schmidt, K.P. and D.D. Davis. (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. p. 246. Diet The diet of Thamnophis elegans relies heavily on the prey available in the environment, and thus varies due to geographical differences. This makes the western terrestrial garter snake an excellent example of polyphagism. There are two main variants that are most prevalent: coastal and inland. Since coastal T. elegans is found along the West Coast of the United States, it is found near the coast of the Pacific Ocean. On the other hand, if the snake population is considered to be inland, it is found near inland water sources such as streams, ponds, or lakes. Coastal populations' food sources mainly include terrestrial prey such as slugs, salamanders, small mammals, and lizards. In contrast, inland populations indulge in a semi-aquatic diet containing frog and toad larvae, leeches, and fish. Thus, aquatic food sources are a staple in the inland snake populations' diet. Coastal snakes are less likely to respond to chemical cues received from fish, which can be inferred by less rapid tongue-flicking when around them. They are also less likely to attack and ingest fish. This preference in diet is so strong that the snake will starve before eating non-preferred prey types. Further, this appears to be genetically determined as this variation in diet is observed in newborn snakes from both populations. When hunting, the Western Garter Snake's actions are chemically and visually mediated on land and in water. Regardless the habitat in which foraging takes place, both ecotypes utilize similar techniques. This consists of attacks that are both aerial and underwater. These include craning, cruising, and diving. However, coastal snakes are less likely to participate these activities. These differences in diet and foraging behavior between coastal and inland snake populations suggest that the species has undergone microevolution. Due to dietary and foraging differences between variants of T. elegans, it can be inferred that coastal populations have filled a niche in the environment that allows them to no longer rely on fish as a major food source.

He bats and throws right-handed. He attended Southwest Missouri State University. Playing career San Francisco Giants Drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 31st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft, Palmer started his professional career strong by having a 1.83 ERA in 2002 with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes. Palmer spent the 2003 season with the Hagerstown Suns. However, Palmer spent three seasons in Double-A before earning a promotion to Triple-A Fresno in 2006. In 2007, Palmer pitched 150 innings for Fresno, recording an 11-8 record with a 4.32 ERA. On August 14, 2008, Palmer was called up by the Giants. He made his Major League debut on August 16 against the Atlanta Braves. He started but only lasted 2.1 innings and allowed 6 earned runs. After making 3 starts, he was sent back to Triple-A and became a free agent at the end of the season. He was 0-2 in his 3 starts for the Giants with an 8.53 ERA. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim In December 2008, he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. In 2009, Palmer would come on as a fifth starter, as the Angels starting rotation struggled to overcome injuries and the death of rookie Nick Adenhart. Palmer made his Angels debut on April 23, 2009, earning the win after pitching six innings, giving up five runs on six hits, three walks, and one strikeout. He continued in the Angels starting rotation amassing a 7-1 record until he was moved to the bullpen on July 1, 2009 when Ervin Santana returned. He finished the season 11-2 with a 3.93 ERA. His elevated win and loss record is helped by the fact that the Angels lineup scored 7.47 runs per game and scored in double figures five times he pitched. In 2010, Palmer was seen as a possible fifth starter after Angels ace John Lackey signed with the Boston Red Sox. However, the signing of Joel Pi√±eiro diminished any chances of Palmer in the starting rotation, and he returned to the bullpen for the 2010 season. In 3 seasons in the Angels organization, Palmer pitched in 57 games (17 as starter) with a 4.22 ERA and 13-5 record. He also spent substantial time with the AAA Salt Lake Bees. San Diego Padres The San Diego Padres signed Palmer to a minor league contract on December 1, 2011. He appeared in 3 games for the Padres in the Majors and allowed 2 earned runs in 2 innings. He was also 6-9 with a 5.66 ERA in 20 starts for the AAA Tucson Padres. Los Angeles Dodgers Palmer signed as a minor league free agent with the Los Angeles Dodgers on January 9, 2013. During spring training, he tore the medial meniscus in his left knee, ending any chance he had to make the Dodgers roster.Matt Palmer injury: Dodgers RHP to have knee surgery, out 6-8 weeks He eventually joined the AAA Albuquerque Isotopes roster in late April.

Original members  The original founding members of the Alma Trio were Roman Totenberg, violin; Gabor Rejto, cello; and Adolph Baller, piano. The members of the Trio had been encouraged by the famed artist, Yehudi Menuhin, to establish themselves as a professional piano trio. Adolph Baller had emigrated to the United States in 1938 with the sponsorship of Menuhin, following harrowing experiences at the hands of the Nazis in Austria and Germany. After arriving in the United States, Baller was a guest of Menuhin and became his regular collaborating pianist, as he had been earlier in Europe.  New violinists  In 1953 Totenberg left the Trio and was replaced by Maurice Wilk, who remained their violinist for ten years until his sudden death in Fall 1963. A review in The New York Times, December 1, 1954, had this to say: :\\"Having acquired a new violinist in Maurice Wilk, the Alma Trio has taken a new lease on life. It deserves to be long and prosperous ‚Äî that is, if the ensemble continues to play as beautifully as it played last night when it opened the cycle of three Beethoven concerts that it is giving at Town Hall . . . few chamber ensembles play the Bonn master with such refinement of spirit and such subtlety of tonal shading.\\" Violinist Andor Toth joined the Trio in the Spring of 1963. During the Fall of 1963, the Alma Trio made their first Russian tour. In a story related to this author, at the airport Rejto was informed of a new rule, that he would need a second ticket for his cello, and there were no remaining seats available. Faced with the impending cancellation of the tour, Rejto responded quickly, \\"But it is a bass balalaika.\\" He was able to fly since that instrument was not listed by the airline  New pianist  This membership of the Alma Trio (Toth, Rejto, Baller) continued until Baller's retirement in 1971, when pianist William Corbett Jones joined the Trio until it disbanded in 1976. From 1982 to 1986 the Trio resumed performing with Andor Toth, Gabor Rejto and Adolph Baller for a few concerts mainly in the northern California bay area. The original cellist \\"Gabby\\" Rejto died in 1987, and the original pianist \\"Usiu\\" Baller died in 1994. Andor Toth lived until 2006 when he died of a stroke in Los Angeles, California at age 81.

Similar to Real Audiencias throughout the Spanish Empire, it was the highest tribunal within the territories of the Captaincy General of the Philippines, a dependency of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Governor-General of the Philippines was appointed as its highest judge, although on many occasions his absence forced other members to rule the tribunal and assume temporary civilian and military powers. History When the Real Audiencia of Manila was established, a justice system already existed that was similar to the judicial and administrative systems of Spain and Latin America. Although the powers and functions of the Royal Audience of Manila were basically the same as those exercised by the other Audiencias, several factors, such as the threat of naval attack by the Dutch and the British and the dependence of the colony on the commerce of China, called for a different approach. The Royal Audience of Manila was created by Royal Decree by King Felipe II dated 5 May 1583, and established in 1584. In the Viceroyalty of New Spain, to which it belonged, it had been preceded by the Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo (1511), the Real Audiencia of Mexico (1527), the Real Audiencia of Panama (1538), the Real Audiencia of Guatemala (1543), and the Real Audiencia of Guadalajara (1548). Law XI (Audiencia y Chanciller√≠a Real de Manila en las Filipinas) of Title XV (De las Audiencias y Chancillerias Reales de las Indias) of Book II of the Recopilaci√≥n de Leyes de las Indias of 1680‚Äîwhich compiles the original decree and the one of May 25, 1596‚Äîdescribes the limits and functions of the Audiencia and its President. > In the city of Manila on the Island of Luzon, Head of the Philippines, shall > reside another Royal Audiencia and Chancellery of ours, with a president, > who shall be governor and captain general; four judges of civil cases > [oidores], who will also be judges of criminal cases [alcaldes del crimen]; > a crown attorney [fiscal]; a bailiff [alguacil mayor]; a lieutenant of the > Gran Chancellor; and the other necessary ministers and officials; and which > shall have for district said Island of Luzon, and the rest of the > Philippines, the Archipelago of China, and its Mainland, discovered and to > be discovered. And we order that the governor and captain general of said > Islands and Provinces, and president of their Royal Audiencia, have > exclusively the superior government of the entire district of said Audiencia > in war and peace, and shall make provisions and favors in our Royal Name, > which in conformity to the laws of this Compilation and the rest of the > Kingdoms of Castile and the instructions and powers that We shall grant, he > should and can do; and in gubernatorial matters and cases that shall arise, > that are of importance, said president-governor should consult on them with > the judges of said Audiencia, so that they give their consultive opinions, > and having heard them, he should provide the most convenient to the service > of God and ours and the peace and tranquility of said Province and Republic. Santiago de Vera, sixth Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines, dissatisfied with the limits that the Audiencia imposed on his authority as a governor, dissolved the institution in 1590, and sent to Mexico all judges that composed the tribunal. Governor-General Francisco Tello de Guzm√°n reestablished it in 1596. Jurisdictions of the Audiencia Most of the laws dealing with the establishment of all 16th and 17th century Audiencias can be found in the Recopilaci√≥n de Leyes de los Reynos de las Indias issued in 1680. Civil Jurisdiction The Audiencia was given supervision over the administration of the estates of deceased persons. Special attention received the trials of cases involving states from native owners, and a provision was made that: \\"our said president and Oidores shall always take great care to be informed of the crimes and abuses which are committed against the Indians under our royal crown, or against those granted in encomiendas to other persons by the governors.\\" The Audiencia was directed to exercise care that \\"the said Indians shall be better treated and instructed in our Holy Catholic Faith, as our free vassals.\\" This was in conformance with the requirement to exercise great care in suits involving the local population, respecting their rites, customs, and practices to which they had always been accustomed. Appointed local government officials were ordered not to dispossess native chiefs of their rule or authority, and on the contrary, to appeal cases involving them without delay to the Audiencia, or to the visiting Oidor. The Audiencia was to devote two days a week to hearing suits to which Indians were parties. The fiscal, who acted as a prosecutor for the government and was the most important official directly connected with the tribunal, was also instructed to \\"take care to assist and favor poor Indians in the suits that they have, and to see that they are not oppressed, maltreated, or wronged.\\" Although it was commanded not to interfere with governors of provinces, it had the right, when charges had been made by private individuals, to conduct investigations on government officials. The Audiencia was also empowered to investigate the judges of provinces, and had the authority to try cases of appeal from local governors, town and city mayors, and other magistrates of the provinces; it also had jurisdiction over civil cases appealed from government officials of the city and original jurisdiction over all criminal cases arising within five leagues of the city of Manila. Civil suits of sufficient importance could be appealed from the Audiencia to the Council of the Indies, that exercised supreme authority over all overseas territories, and acted as a last resort Supreme Court. Government Jurisdiction The Audiencia exercised very pronounced authority over the services of public servants and government officials in the Philippines, and reported to the court all matters relative to the conduct, work, or attitude of any employee or official of the government. The Governor-General himself was forbidden to authorize extraordinary expenditures from the treasury without express royal permission, except in cases of riot or invasion. Although the Governor-General had the right to make appointments in most departments of the government, except in the offices appointed directly by the Crown, the Audiencia imposed a very strict check on these appointments that was almost invariably a source of conflict throughout the history of the colonial government. =Oidores(Justices)= The president of the Audiencia was empowered to delegate on the (oidores) to investigate about the correct administration of government and justice in the provinces. They were to note the state of the towns and their needs, the means taken for the construction and preservation of public buildings. Oidores were also required to check on the condition of the natives on the encomiendas and make sure they were faithfully and efficiently instructed and not permitted to live in ignorance and idolatry. They also had to make reports on the state of the soil, the condition of the crops and harvests, extent of mineral wealth and timber, and just about everything that had to do with the general welfare. On these trips the Oidores were authorized to take such action as they deemed to be necessary. Oidores were forbidden to receive any fees from or to act as advocates for any private person, and they could not hold income-yielding estates in arable land or cattle. Oidores were also forbidden to engage in business, either singly or in partnership, nor could they avail themselves of the services of the natives. Any person could bring suit against an Oidor. The Audiencia was forbidden to act alone in the selection of the Judges, and magistrates were forbidden to hear cases affecting themselves or their relatives. No relative of the President or of an Oidor could be appointed legally to a government post. Criminal charges against the oidores were to be tried by the Governor-General, with the assistance of government officials fit to judge on the case. Military Jurisdiction The Audiencia did assume responsibility for the defense of the Philippines on many occasions, such as in 1607, when it maintained the defense of Manila and Cavite against the Dutch, or between 1762 and 1764, when Oidor Sim√≥n de Anda y Salazar assumed military power on behalf of the Audiencia, organizing and maintaining a defense against the British who had invaded Manila, a move that was later approved by the King of Spain. The Audiencia also assumed temporary military powers during the governments of Pedro Bravo de Acu√±a, Juan de Silva, Juan Ni√±o de Tabora, Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera (1635-1644) and Diego Fajardo Chac√≥n, as they were engaged in lengthy military expeditions outside Manila. =Juicio de Residencia= Among the most frequently complaints made against the Governor-General and his military subordinates was their abuse of power. In order to make all military personnel accountable for their actions a Juicio de Residencia (Trial of residence) was held at the end of their terms (although it could be held at any time, if deemed necessary). This judicial trial was conducted by a judicial official, and it combined the features of a general survey of the career of the official under investigation, an auditing of his accounts and a formal trial. Its purpose was to ascertain whether or not the official had faithfully executed his duties and it served to clear him if he was found to have acted honestly, giving him a clean certificate of recommendation. If he was found guilty of official misconduct, dishonesty or any other crimes, he was apprehended, degraded, and punished, according to his wrongdoings. Edward Gaylord Bourne described the process as extremely harsh: \\"It was designed to provide a method by which officials could be held to strict accountability for all. acts during their term of office. ... To allow a contest in the courts involving the governor s powers during his term of office would be subversive of his authority. He was then to be kept in bounds by realizing that a day of judgment was impending, when everyone, even the poorest Indian, might in perfect security bring forward his accusation. In the Philippines the Residencia for a governor lasted six months and was conducted by his successor and all the charges made were forwarded to Spain.\\" One of the most famous Residencia trials was that of Sebasti√°n Hurtado de Corcuera, Governor-General from 1636 to 1644, who during his rule had managed to anger several personalities from the ecclesiastic, military and civilian hierarchies. Upon leaving office he had a particularly severe Juicio de Residencia after which he was sentenced to a prison term of which he served five years at Fort Santiago and made to pay a substantial fine. Another Governor-General, Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, was convicted at the end of his term in 1701 for cheating on the native laborers. The Court concluded that \\"although the estimated cost of construction for the government house was 30,000 pesos, only 6,000 pesos were disbursed, the remainder representing what the natives contributed of their sweat and blood\\", at a time when one peso was the equivalent of the yearly salary of a native galleon builder in Cavite and a house could be bought for twenty pesos. Jose Basco y Vargas, who first came to the Philippines during the administration of Governor Pedro Manuel de Arandia, as Oidor of the Audiencia, was also made to endure a Juicio de Residencia with charges brought against him in 1764, during which a review was made of his acts while as an Oidor he continued resistance once Manila had fallen during the brief British occupation of Manila, in defiance of the orders of Archbishop Rojo. His actions were not only approved, but he was also awarded high honors and promotions. On November 19, 1769, he was granted an annual pension of 3000 pesos for life. Basco y Vargas later went on to become the 44th Governor of the Philippines, ruling from 1778 until 1787. Ecclesiastic Jurisdiction The Audiencia exercised both executive and judicial powers over the Church. The tribunal ruled over disputes between orders, between the government and the Church or any of its representatives, over cases relating to land titles, over abuses against the natives by representatives of the Church, and over cases involving the Jus patronatus. However the Audiencia was ordered to exercise its mandate without harming the rights and prerogatives of the church and to assist the prelates on all occasions when they petitioned for aid from the Spanish Crown. Some other ecclesiastical affairs could also claim the attention of the Audiencia, such as the supervision over the assignment of benefices, and especially with the settlement of the property and estates of Bishops and Archbishops who had died in the Philippines. Educational Jurisdiction The Audiencia of Manila also exercised its authority over the colleges and universities. Therefore, Oidores and fiscals were automatically excluded as candidates rectories. Instead, they were to make sure that the level of education in the universities, colleges and seminaries was up to approved standards, and that candidates for the licentiate did deserve the degree. As early as 1585 the Jesuits had requested to establish a college in Manila, but although the Audiencia reported satisfactorily on the work of the Jesuit order, it concluded that there was no need to finance such a costly enterprise, granting only permission to establish the college of San Jose in 1601, that managed to maintain itself without royal aid until 1767. in 1648 the Jesuits asked again the Audiencia for the right to grant academic degrees at the newly upgraded University of Santo Tomas, and again their request was denied by the tribunal. However the Audiencia's ruling was overturned by the Council of the Indies in 1653. In 1769, after the expulsion of the Jesuits, the Audiencia tried for a time to administer San Jose, but a cedula was issued ordering to close down the college and transfer all existing students over to secular colleges and seminaries. The Audiencia then reported to the Council of the Indies on the transaction details that involved revenues derived from Jesuit properties, whose income was remitted to the Royal Treasury. The Archbishop of Manila tried to obtain the administration over all those properties and revenues, but it was stopped by the Audiencia. The Crown sustained the Audiencia's measures and forbade the prelate from trying to appropriate any of these assets. District Audiencias In 1893 two District Audiencias were established, one in Cebu and the other in Vigan. They were subordinated to Manila and only had jurisdiction over criminal cases on appeal.

After graduation, he was sent to the Eastern Front, later completed the machine gunner course, and in March 1918 - an aviation course in Wiener Neustadt‚Äôs renowned Theresian Military Academy. After Poland regained independence in the fall of 1918, Sosnowski joined the newly created Polish Army. He fought with distinction in the Polish Soviet War, as a soldier of the 8th Uhlan Regiment of Duke Jozef Poniatowski. Promoted to the Rotmistrz, he became commandant of a horse squadron of the 8th Regiment. Sosnowski was an excellent cavalry rider, taking part in international tournaments in such places as Paris and Berlin. Intelligence activities In 1926 Sosnowski, following advice of his friend, captain Marian Chodacki, became a member of the Second Department of Polish General Staff, which was responsible for military intelligence as well as espionage activities (see: History of Polish intelligence services). After completing a course, he was sent to Berlin, becoming director of the In-3 office of Polish intelligence. Upon arriving in German capital, Sosnowski presented himself as a Polish Baron Ritter von Nalecz, who deeply disliked Jozef Pilsudski and wanted to closely cooperate with Germany. Furthermore, he was presenting himself as a rabid anticommunist, member of a secret antibolshevik military organization. The young and handsome \\"Baron\\" quickly became popular among Berlin‚Äôs social circles and started an affair with Baroness Benita von Falkenhayn, a relative of Erich von Falkenhayn, former Chief of the General Staff of the German Imperial Army. In December 1926, he talked her into cooperating with Polish intelligence, as she, owing to her connections, had a detailed knowledge of the German General Staff. Soon afterwards, Sosnowski managed to gain services of G√ºnther Rudloff, officer of the Abwehr‚Äôs Berlin‚Äôs branch. Rudloff agreed to cooperate, because he had owed a significant amount of money to the Pole. Sosnowski‚Äôs quick successes raised temporary suspicion among officers of the Second Department of the General Headquarters in Warsaw. However, his next movements were even more impressive and convinced Polish headquarters of his professionalism. Agents working for the Polish spy included Irene von Jena of the Reichswehr‚Äôs headquarters (Reichswehrministerium) as well as Renate von Natzmer from the same office. As von Jena hated Poles, Sosnowski at first presented himself as a British journalist named Graves. Later, he revealed his real identity to her. Additional agents were Lotta von Lemmel and Isabelle von Tauscher, both of whom worked in the headquarters of the Reichswehr. Some of these women, including von Falkenhayn and von Natzmer, were also his lovers. All agents supplied the Poles with very useful documentation. In 1929 Sosnowski, with help from Renate von Natzmer, acquired a copy of a war game against Poland, called Organisation Kriegsspiel. He demanded 40 000 German marks for the document, but his superiors from Warsaw refused to pay so much, thinking that information provided by Sosnowski was in fact German disinformation,The Guardians of Europe: Polish secret services protect the borders of the European Union and Sosnowski himself had made a secret deal with von Natzmer. Ritter von Nalecz cut the price by half and finally, he sent all documents to Warsaw for free. Nevertheless, the Poles did not take advantage of these documents. It is estimated that until 1934, the In-3 office, headed by Sosnowski and with a support base located at Polish embassy in Berlin, was the best of all foreign branches of Polish intelligence. At the same time, its activities were regarded as very expensive, costing around 2 million zlotys. Arrest and return to Poland In the fall of 1933, the Abwehr found out about the Polish network of agents, probably due to the treachery of Lieutenant Jozef Gryf-Czajkowski, who was a double agent and who had previously held Sosnowski‚Äôs post in Berlin. Also, a German actress Maria Kruse, another of Sosnowski‚Äôs lovers, helped the Abwehr with the operation. Sosnowski was arrested by the Gestapo on February 27, 1934, during a party in an apartment at 36 L√ºtzowufer Street. Within a few days, more people were incarcerated, including Benita von Falkenhayn, Renate von Natzmer, and Irene von Jena. G√ºnther Rudloff managed to avoid arrest, as he claimed that due to cooperation with the Pole, he managed to get useful intelligence information. The Nazis found out about Rudloff's activities later, and facing the death sentence, he committed suicide on July 7, 1941. The process began in February 1935. On the 16th of the same month, von Falkenhayn and von Natzmer were sentenced to death and later beheaded, while Sosnowski with von Jena were sentenced to life imprisonment. Sosnowski himself was shocked at the deaths of his mistresses, as he was quoted in Time, in the August 17, 1936 issue: I am haunted by the deaths of those women. Until I was released in an exchange of prisoners I had seen no human face for 14 months. My food was lowered to me by guards from a trap door. The tragic deaths of those two - my former associates - haunt me night & day and I can only attempt to gain peace through prayer for their souls. According to some sources, Benita von Falkenhayn wanted to marry Sosnowski, and thus save her life by obtaining a Polish passport, but Adolf Hitler thwarted this attempt. The agent was released in April 1936, when he was exchanged for three German spies, caught in Poland. As Polish headquarters had always been suspicious of Sosnowski and his astonishing successes, he was accused of fraud and high treason and put under house arrest. His trial started on March 29, 1938, in the Military District Court in Warsaw. Sosnowski denied all charges, but on June 17, 1939, he was found guilty of treason and cooperation with Germany and sentenced to 15 years as well as a fine of 200 000 zlotys fine. He wanted to appeal against the decision, but the outbreak of World War II made it impossible . World War II The further fate of Sosnowski is difficult to establish. According to one report, he was evacuated east from prison in early September 1939 and was shot by the prison guards on September 16 or 17 near Brzesc nad Bugiem or Jaremcze. Another report states that Sosnowski was indeed shot but survived and later was captured by the NKVD. He was arrested on November 2, 1939 and, by order of Pavel Sudoplatov, was transported to the Lubyanka Prison, in Moscow. There, after talks with officers of Soviet intelligence, he decided to cooperate with them. He allegedly worked as an expert on Polish and German affairs, and among others, he reportedly participated in interrogations of General Mieczys≈Çaw Boruta- Spiechowicz. After the outbreak of German-Soviet War, Sosnowski, who had become an NKVD agent, taught at an espionage school in Saratov, where, in 1943, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In the same year, he allegedly was transferred to German-occupied Poland, where he cooperated with the communist People's Army. Allegedly, in September 1944, during the Warsaw Uprising, he found himself in Warsaw, where he probably died. Ivan Serov maintained that Sosnowski was executed by the Home Army in 1944, by Pavel Sudoplatov stated in 1958, that Sosnowski was executed in 1945 by the order of Nikita Khrushchev. Some Russian sources claim that he died in 1942 in Saratov during a hunger strike.

The disorder shares similar characteristics with Bardet‚ÄìBiedl syndrome and Cohen syndrome, both of which are autosomal recessive genetic disorders. MORM syndrome can be distinguished from the above disorders because symptoms appear at a young age. The disorder is not dependent on sex of the offspring, both male and female offspring are equally likely to inherit the disorder. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the INPP5E gene which can be located on chromosome 9 in humans. Further mapping resulted in the identification of a MORM syndrome locus on chromosome 9q34.3 between the genetic markers D9S158 and D9S905. Presentation For individuals with MORM syndrome, symptoms do not appear until about one year of age. From conception to birth, individuals with MORM syndrome appear asymptotic, with no abnormal characteristics. Vision is negatively affected within the first year of life, particularly night vision. Individuals with MORM syndrome experience decreased visual acuity, meaning their ability to see distinct sharp lines decreases. Vision quality continues to deteriorate until age three. Any further reduction in vision acuity is not observed until the individual is between the ages thirty to forty. Delayed sentence processing and intellectual disability is associated with individuals with MORM syndrome, primarily observed at age four. Individuals continue to develop and grow until they are five to twelve years old. During this age bracket, truncal obesity can develop, characterized by the buildup of fat around one's trunk or torso as opposed to the person's extremities. Males enter puberty at around age twelve and develop normally, except for their penis, which will remain at the prepubescent size, resulting in a micropenis. Both the life span and fertility of individuals with MORM syndrome is unclear . Genetic  MORM syndrome is associated with the gene INPP5E. INPP5E is a gene whose function is not well understood. It is hypothesized to play a role in primary cilia stability. A homozygous mutation in the INPP5E gene, on chromosome 9q34, is the cause for MORM syndrome. The mutation causes a homozygous transition in the last exon of the INPP5E gene. This transition results in the DNA bases changing from a cytosine residue to a thymine residue. The resulting protein will then have an altered amino acid sequence. In unaffected individuals this specific codon (region of DNA bases) is supposed to code for the amino acid glutamine. In cases of MORM syndrome this codon codes for a termination sequence, which prematurely stops the production of the protein. In unaffected individuals the protein is evenly disbursed throughout the cilia axoneme, which stabilizes the cilia, which are antenna like structures which protrude from the extracellular surface of the cell. They play an importatn role in extracellular signalling/communication between cells and their environment. When the INPP5E gene is mutated, the protein is damaged and is unable to spread out along the cilia axoneme or interact with other stabilizing proteins. This inability to stabilize one's cilia axoneme results in MORM syndrome. The exact mechanism as to how the mutation in the INPP5E gene causes cilia instability is still not well understood. Diagnosis MORM syndrome is a genetic disorder obtained through inheritance. The main method for testing individuals showing symptoms of MORM syndrome is sequence analysis of the entire coding region. When performing a sequence analysis of the entire coding region the gene INPP5E is targeted. Sequence analysis is the biotechnological process in which the structure and sequence of DNA, RNA, or protein sequence is determined through the use of technology. This sequence can be analyzed to determine mutations or abnormalities in that particular region. When testing for MORM syndrome, sequence analysis of the region of the genome which contains the gene INPP5E is targeted and examined to look for mutations.

History Relations between the two countries date back to the reigns of Prince Charles III of Monaco and Tsar Alexander II of Russia. During this period the two nations signed numerous treaties and agreements, including the extradition of criminals, mutual legal assistance, recognition of the civil status of people and for medical aid. After the establishment of the Order of Saint-Charles in Monaco in 1858, Tsar Alexander II became the first member of a royal family to be bestowed the Monegasque award. In 1877, Charles III appointed Chevalier Jean Plancher as the Monegasque Consul in Saint Petersburg. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 relations between the two states were suspended. Prior to the admittance of Monaco into the United Nations in 1993, the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union was not a priority, however the two states maintained contacts via the Soviet Embassy in Paris and the Embassy of France in Moscow. Russian Federation relations Diplomatic relations Monaco and the Russian Federation established consular relations in July 1996. In 2002, Prince Rainier III appointed Nikolai Orlov as Monaco's honorary consulate in Saint Petersburg, and Albert II travelled to the city to open the honorary consulate on 31 July 2003. On 13 April 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a presidential decree directing the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to begin negotiations with their Monegasque counterparts with a view to establishing full diplomatic relations between the two states. Diplomatic relations between the two states were established on 11 July 2006 after the exchange of notes between the Russian and Monegasque embassies in Paris. On 16 March 2007, Aleksandr Avdeyev was appointed as Russian Ambassador to Monaco, in concurrence with his posting as Ambassador of Russia to France. Diplomatic relations between the two states were established on 10 April 2007. Vladimir Putin with Albert II during a trip to Tuva in 2007. The current Ambassador of Russia to Monaco is Alexander Orlov, who was appointed by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on 1 December 2008. Orlov, who is resident in Paris, presented his credentials to Albert II, Prince of Monaco on 24 March 2009 at the Prince's Palace of Monaco. The current Ambassador of Monaco to Russia is Claude Giordan, with residence in Berlin, who presented his credentials to Russian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vladimir Titov in Moscow on 12 June 2009. Political relations On 12 August 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin hosted Albert II at Peterhof in Saint Petersburg, where Putin thanked the Monegasque Prince for his support for Russia's successful bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi on the Black Sea. In what was seen as a sign of Putin's gratitude, the following day the two leaders travelled to Tuva in Central Asia. Whilst in Tuva, the two leaders visited the Por-Bazhyn fortress where an archaeological dig was underway, and went on a rafting and fishing trip on the Yenisei River. During the trip, Albert was presented with two Baikal seals from Alexander Tishanin, the Governor of Irkutsk Oblast, which were later placed in a home at Monaco's Oceanographic Museum. According to a former adviser to Albert II, in a sign of the increasing friendship between Putin and Albert II, Russian officials sent a team of builders to Monaco in 2008 to erect a three-bedroom dacha in the garden of Albert's estate, located in the hills behind Monte Carlo. Economic relations Monaco's status as a tax haven has turned the Principality into a favourite playground for rich Russians. There are currently four Russian enterprises doing business on the territory of Monaco. =Trade relations= Trade turnover between the two nations is nominal, reaching approximately ‚Ç¨1 million per year. Russian exports to Monaco are food products, optical instruments and devices, and clocks and watches. Monegasque exports to Russia are food products, clothing, automobiles and perfumery products. Cultural relations Cultural relations between Monaco and Russia date back to the beginning of the twentieth century. Between 1911 and 1929, Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was staged in Monaco. To mark the centennial of Ballets Russes performances in Monaco, in 2009‚Äì2010, the Monte- Carlo Philharmonic Orchestra staged concerts marking the works of Diaghilev, which include performances of Petrushka, Le Sacre du printemps, Daphnis et Chlo√©, Sh√©h√©razade and L'Oiseau de feu. The Louis Notari Library will also have an exhibition on Diaghilev and his troupe. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, various famous Russian cultural organisations have toured to Monaco, including the Bolshoi Ballet, Mariinsky Ballet, Red Army Choir and Dance Ensemble, amongst others.

Three subspecies are currently recognized. Geographic range It is found exclusively along the coast of Oregon and California.  Description  The aquatic garter snake grows up to 18-40 inches (46‚Äì102 cm) long. Its dorsal coloration varies greatly. The different coloration patterns are: pale gray with alternating rows of darker blotches on the sides, dark brown with borders that are less distinct, or nearly all black. A long yellow stripe running down the back may be present or absent, only confined to the neck, or just very indistinct. The throat and underside of the snake are whitish to yellow. One color morph of the aquatic garter snake has a blue-gray background color with a faint olive-colored dorsal stripe and white dots along its sides. Another color morph has a yellow dorsal stripe with black spots along its sides. The second color morph has the more classic garter snake look; however, due to its behavior and scalation, it is grouped in this species.  Habitat  It can most commonly be found on the edges of bushlands, woodlands, grasslands, and forests near ponds, marshes, streams and lakes.  Behavior  When feeling threatened, this snake will seek shelter in a nearby water source. Occasionally, while the snake is hunting for food in a stream, it will flick its tongue above the water to mimic an insect that a small fish would usually eat, thus luring the prey into its mouth.

The character's history on the show has mostly revolved around her multiple relationships and children; most notably being half of a supercouple duo on As the World Turns with Jack Snyder (Michael Park). Storylines 1995‚Äì96 Carly Tenney is the daughter of Ray Tenney and Sheila Washburn. Carly originally came to town in search of her \\"cousin\\" Rosanna Cabot and the Cabot fortune. When Carly was little, Sheila abandoned her, married Alexander Cabot and gave birth to Rosanna. Ray married Sheila's sister, Lee, and raised Carly as her own daughter. Carly had a one- night stand with a man she met in a bar soon after arriving in town, whom she later learned was Michael \\"Mike\\" Kasnoff, Rosanna's fianc√©. Carly tried everything she could to destroy their relationship. After Mike and Rosanna's wedding was called off, he and Carly slept together again and she became pregnant. Mike and Rosanna reconciled but Carly used the pregnancy to get closer to Mike. Rosanna became jealous of Carly and offered to buy Carly's baby. Carly at first refused but later used the offer in another attempt to end Mike and Rosanna's relationship. During a confrontation with Rosanna, Carly fell and went into premature labor. She gave birth to a stillborn, who she named Nora Kasnoff. Carly left to go to Hong Kong. 1997‚Äì2010 Once she was back in Oakdale, Carly met Brad Snyder. She fell in love with Brad's brother, Jack. Her sister Rosanna agreed to provide Carly's child with a 50 million dollar trust fund if she would have the baby with a man to whom she was married (who was not Mike). Growing impatient, she later gave Carly a deadline: midnight the end of 1998. Unfortunately for Carly, the deadline was given in the late winter of 1998, giving her little time to get pregnant. She wanted to have Jack's baby, but he was injured in the line of duty and could not have sex. Deciding that the money was more important than her love for Jack (or feeling she could get him back later), she seduced Hal Munson. After they married, she was unsure whether she was pregnant, so as the end of March neared, Carly got desperate and enlisted John Dixon to inseminate her. In the meantime, Carly continued to pine for Jack, and Hal sensed this, leading to their divorce. Soon after, she found that her due date was in January, indicating that John was the likely father and not Hal. So she quickly married John so fulfill Rosanna's terms. As 1999 loomed, Carly decided to induce labor early to ensure her trust fund, but John refused to risk the baby's safety since the plan was for him to raise the child when it was born. However, when Carly felt a contraction in her 8th month, she had a change of heart and decided that she was keeping this child, money or no money. Not long after, fate intervened and miraculously, Jack delivered Carly's baby boy on New Year's Eve‚Äîmere minutes before the deadline. John named the baby Parker after his mother's maiden name. After this, she became fairly depressed. She had lost Jack to another woman and couldn't handle it. She began drinking to help fix her problems. Her son, Parker, and Craig Montgomery were the only ones that notice her problems. After a while she agreed to marry Craig, and he was trying to help her with her problem. Her sister Rosanna came back to town and Carly and Craig lied to her about her alcoholism problem, as they were planning their wedding. After an intervention staged by her family, Carly finally agreed to go to rehab. Then Carly wrote a letter to Sage. She returns from rehab for Brad's funeral and she reveals she has become sober. She is happy to see Craig but then learns that he and Rosanna are having an affair and they break up. Then Craig and Rosanna planned to marry but she leaves him at the altar after realizing he still has feelings for Carly, and she flees to Germany. When Jack and Janet separate, he and Carly grow close once again and when she learns that Janet slept with Dusty she plots to break them up. On September 15, 2010, Jack and Carly re-marry, but while coming home after their wedding, they find Jack's ex-wife, Janet in labor so, Jack and Carly help deliver Janet's child. On September 16, 2010, Carly received news that she was pregnant. By current tense, Carly would have given birth to her child accordingly if the pregnancy was a success.

The Martis name refers to the geographic region of Martis Creek which spans Nevada County, California and Placer County, California. Culture Martis traveled to lower elevations in the winter and higher elevations in the summer in loose-knit groups. They lived in base camps on valley margins, often near hot springs. In the winter, they lived in pit houses with hearths, pit caches, and occasionally burials. Extended families are believed to have lived together. Summer camps were often located near springs or creeks.Elston, 143 They shared certain traits which included making stone tools from basalt, using pestles and mortars, and hunting with atlatls and spears. Martis engaged in a hunter-gatherer economic system. Martis people processed seeds and hunted big game, such as bighorn sheep, pronghorn antelope, deer, bison, and elk.Elston, 142, 145 Descendants Moratto states that the Martis were not related to the Washoe, but may have been linked with the Maidu. However, other scholars (Robert G. Elston and Catherine S. Fowler) suggest that the Martis complex overlaps culturally and geographically with the Kings Beach complex of ancestral Washoe people. Sites The Meadow Lake Petroglyphs, attributed to the Martis, are a national historical landmark. Another notable Martis archaeological site includes the Grouse Lakes Area of Nevada County, called the Martis Archaeological Complex, and cataloged as style 7 rock art. Others sites include Truckee Meadows‚ÄìSteamboat Hot Springs, Bordertown, and Hallelujah Junction.

It elected as his successor Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, who took the name Clement XIV. Clement XIII (portrait by Anton Raphael Mengs)  Death of Clement XIII  Clement XIII died suddenly on 2 February 1769, a day before the date of the consistory that he had convoked to examine the demands for the general suppression of the Society of Jesus. The various courts under the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Portugal (under the House of Braganza) had exerted strong pressure on the Holy See to suppress this order through almost the whole of his pontificate. In 1759 Jesuits were expelled from Portugal and all its possessions, in 1764 from the Kingdom of France, in 1767 from Spain and in 1768 from the Kingdom of Naples, the Kingdom of Sicily and the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza. Clement XIII strongly defended the Society (e.g. in the bull Apostolicum pascendi in 1765), but without success. In January 1769 France and Naples seized the papal territories around Avignon, Benevento and Pontecorvo to force the pope to issue a decree for the suppression of the order. The sudden death of 75-year-old Clement XIII left this difficult decision to his successor.  Divisions in the College of Cardinals and the candidates to the papacy  The papal conclave in 1769 was almost completely dominated by the problem of the Society of Jesus. The Sacred College of Cardinals was divided into two blocs: pro-Jesuits and anti-Jesuits, but several cardinals were neutral. The pro-Jesuit faction, called Zelanti, grouped Italian curial cardinals who opposed the secular influences on the Church. Their leaders were Gian Francesco and Alessandro Albani and cardinal- nephew of the deceased pope Carlo Rezzonico. The anti-Jesuit bloc (called also \\"court faction\\") grouped crown-cardinals of the Catholic Powers: France, Spain and Naples. Respectively ruled at the time by Louis XV of France, Charles III of Spain and Ferdinand III of Sicily/Ferdinand IV of Naples. In spite of the national divisions they worked together for the main goal ‚Äì suppression of the Society of Jesus. The Bourbon courts had decided to put the official leadership of this bloc in the hands of the French Cardinal de Bernis. He and his colleagues were instructed to block every pro-Jesuit candidature, even with the official exclusion if necessary. Several cardinals, among them Lorenzo Ganganelli, did not belong to either faction.About the factions and their leaders: Littell's Living Age, pp. 597-599The English Review, p. 12 (court faction) and 21 (Zelanti) The French government was more fastidious than Spanish and Neapolitan. Only three cardinals were considered good candidates: Conti, Durini and GanganelliSede Vacante 1769; these cardinals were mentioned in the report of French ambassador dated August 29, 1765; this report mentioned also a fourth \\"good\\" candidate, Cardinal Galli, who died in 1767. Out of these 43 cardinals only 27 or 28 were actually considered papabile, while the remaining 15 were excluded due to their age or health.  Conclave  Cardinal de Bernis was one of the leading figures in the conclave The conclave began on 15 February 1769. Initially only 27 cardinals participated.Sede Vacante 1769 Zelanti, taking advantage of the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal Flavio Chigi. In one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, and Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown-cardinal present in the early ballots, was able to join some neutral cardinals to block Chigi's candidature.Littell's Living Age, p. 597 An unprecedented event was the visit of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, who arrived incognito in Rome on 6 March and was allowed to enter the conclave. He stayed there two weeks, freely debating with the electors. He did not press them but only expressed the wish for the election of a pope who would be able to carry out his duties with the proper respect for the secular rulers.A. Piazzoni, p. 287-288 Cardinal de Bernis entered the conclave at the end of March and took the leadership of the anti- Jesuit faction from the hands of Cardinal Orsini, who could have blocked Zelanti's actions only with the great difficulties. Bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with French ambassador Marquis d'Aubeterre, which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave.Littell's Living Age, p. 598 Ambassadors of France and Spain urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during the next few weeks Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits. In this way twenty-three out of twenty-eight papabile were eliminated, among them strongly pro-Jesuit Cardinal Fantuzzi, who at some point was very close to achieving election to the papal throne,Littell's Living Age, p. 600 as well as Cavalchini, Colonna, Stoppani, Pozzobonelli,Artaud de Montor, p. 79 Sersale,K. Dopiera≈Ça, p. 366 and several others. The arrival of Spanish cardinals Solis and de la Cerda on 27 April strengthened the anti-Jesuit party. They also violated the law of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with Spanish ambassador Azpuru. The Spaniards had fewer scruples than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal Malvezzi, took the matter into their own hands. They paid attention to the only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, O.F.M.Conv. The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a great mystery ‚Äì he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the pontificate of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. Ganganelli answered that \\"he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns\\". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, The article indicates that there is some evidence that such a document had actually been written and signed by Ganganelli. K. Dopiera≈Ça, p. 366 denies it but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors. In the same time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as indifferent or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals.Littell's Living Age, p. 601 Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.The English Review, pp. 25-26 Election of Clement XIV In the final ballot on 19 May 1769 Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli was elected to the papacy receiving all votes except of his own, which he gave to Carlo Rezzonico, nephew of Clement XIII and one of the leaders of Zelanti. He took the name of Clement XIV, in honour of Clement XIII, who had elevated him to the cardinalate.

Prior to founding the magazine, Hunter had been a writer of fiction for ten years, and had received a Bachelor's Degree in the field of journalism. Every issue of the publication contained the request for contributions, \\"If you like to draw, write fiction, poetry or essays, Noggin wants to publish your work.\\" In an interview with Cedar Rapids Gazette, the founder of the publication explained its broad attitude towards acceptance of contributions: \\"The editorial principle we've stuck to, to our detriment sometimes, we do not edit people's stuff, especially on the grounds of content.

As a 13-year-old, he won the first tournament event he ever entered ‚Äì the Men's Pairs at a New York sectional ‚Äì making him the youngest winner in the history of the event. When Levin was 15, the family moved to Miami. In March 1973, he became the youngest life master in the history of the American Contract Bridge League (ACBL) at the age of 15 years and 4 months, a record since broken. Once in Miami, Levin met two players ‚Äì Billy Seamon and Russell Arnold ‚Äì who had a profound influence on his bridge career. By the age of 17, Levin was playing professionally on teams with Arnold, sponsored by Bud Reinhold. In 1979, his team (Reinhold, Arnold, Jeff Meckstroth and Eric Rodwell) tied for first in the Reisinger Board-a-Match Teams. Because the Reisinger was a qualifying event for the playoff to determine North America's representative in the world championship (ACBL team trials), a playoff between the Reisinger winners was necessary; they lost to the Dallas Aces comprising Ira Rubin, Fred Hamilton, Bob Hamman and Bobby Wolff. Next spring the Reinhold team won the Vanderbilt Knockout Teams in Fresno, California, qualifying for the team trials. The squad easily won the right later that year to represent the United States in the 1981 Bermuda Bowl in Port Chester, New York. The team added John Solodar and defeated Zia Mahmood-led Pakistan for the championship. The win made Levin, at 23 years old, the youngest world champion at the time, a distinction he held for 34 years, until 19 year old Michal Klukowski's win with the 2015 champion Polish team. About a year later, Levin moved to Chicago to work as an options trader. When the market crashed in 1987, Levin was back to Florida, entering the real estate business with one of his brothers. He moved to the Orlando area in 1988 and lived there for twelve years. His regular partner is Steve Weinstein, who is also a world class poker player. When forming their partnership, they spent a week with Marty Bergen in Florida to put together their system.

Types   Aromatic Fire-cured  Prior to the American Civil War, most tobacco grown in the US was fire-cured dark-leaf. This type of tobacco was planted in fertile lowlands, used a robust variety of leaf, and was either fire cured or air cured. Aromatic Fire-cured smoking tobacco is dark leaf, a robust variety of tobacco used as a condimental for pipe blends. It is cured by smoking over gentle fires. In the United States, it is grown in northern middle Tennessee, western Kentucky and in Virginia. Fire-cured tobacco grown in Kentucky and Tennessee is used in some chewing tobaccos, moist snuff, some cigarettes and as a condiment leaf in pipe tobacco blends. It has a rich, slightly floral taste, and adds body and aroma to the blend.  Latakia  Another fire- cured tobacco is Latakia and is produced from oriental varieties of N. tabacum. The leaves are cured and smoked over smoldering fires of local hardwoods and aromatic shrubs in Cyprus and Syria. Latakia has a pronounced flavor and a very distinctive smoky aroma, and is used in Balkan and English- style pipe tobacco blends.  Brightleaf tobacco (Virgina tobacco)  Brightleaf tobacco leaf ready for harvest. When it turns yellow-green the sugar content is at its peak, and it will cure to a deep golden color with mild taste. The leaves are harvested progressively up the stem from the base, as they ripen. Sometime after the War of 1812, demand for a milder, lighter, more aromatic tobacco arose. Ohio, Pennsylvania and Maryland all innovated with milder varieties of the tobacco plant. Farmers around the country experimented with different curing processes. But the breakthrough did not come until around 1839. Growers had noticed that sandy, highland soil produced thinner, weaker plants. Captain Abisha Slade, of Caswell County, North Carolina had considerable infertile, sandy soil, and planted the new \\"gold- leaf\\" varieties on it. Slade owned a slave, Stephen, who around 1839 accidentally produced the first true bright tobacco. He used charcoal to restart a fire used to cure the crop. The surge of heat turned the leaves yellow. Using that discovery, Slade developed a system for producing bright tobacco, cultivated on poorer soils and using charcoal for heat-curing. Slade made many public appearances to share the bright-leaf process with other farmers. His success helped him build a brick house in Yanceyville, North Carolina, and at one time he had many slaves. News spread through the area pretty quickly. The infertile sandy soil of the Appalachian piedmont was suddenly profitable, and people rapidly developed flue-curing techniques, a more efficient way of smoke-free curing. Farmers discovered that Bright leaf tobacco needs thin, starved soil, and those who could not grow other crops found that they could grow tobacco. Formerly unproductive farms reached 20‚Äì35 times their previous worth. By 1855, six Piedmont counties adjoining Virginia ruled the tobacco market. By the outbreak of the Civil War, the town of Danville, Virginia had developed a bright-leaf market for the surrounding area in Caswell County, North Carolina and Pittsylvania County, Virginia. Danville was also the main railway head for Confederate soldiers going to the front. These brought bright tobacco with them from Danville to the lines, traded it with each other and Union soldiers, and developed quite a taste for it. At the end of the war, the soldiers went home and a national market had developed for the local crop. Caswell and Pittsylvania counties were the only two counties in the South that increased in total wealth after the war.  Burley  The origin of White Burley tobacco was credited to a Mr. Webb in 1864, who grew it near Higginsport, Ohio, from seed from Bracken County, Kentucky. He noticed it yielded a different type of light leaf shaded from white to yellow, and cured differently. By 1866, he harvested 20,000 pounds of Burley tobacco and sold it in 1867 at the St. Louis Fair for $58 per hundred pounds. By 1883, the principal market for this tobacco was Cincinnati, but it was grown throughout central Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. In 1880 Kentucky produced 36 percent of the total national tobacco production, and was first in the country, with nearly twice as much tobacco produced as by Virginia, then the second-place state.J.M. Stoddart, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. American Supplement (Stoddart's Encyclopaedia Americana: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, and Companion to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. (9th ed.) and to All Other Encyclopaedias, Volume 1), 1883, pp. 120-123, accessed 5 February 2011 Burley tobacco is a light air-cured tobacco used primarily for cigarette production. In the United States, it is produced in an eight-state belt with approximately 70 percent produced in Kentucky. Tennessee produces approximately 20 percent, with smaller amounts produced in Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia. Burley tobacco is produced in many other countries, with major production in Brazil, Malawi and Argentina. In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April.  Cavendish  Cavendish is a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco and is not a type of tobacco. The processing and the cut are used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco. Cavendish can be produced out of any tobacco type but is usually one of, or a blend of; Kentucky, Virginia, and Burley and is most commonly used for pipe tobacco and cigars. The process begins by pressing the tobacco leaves into a cake about an inch thick. Heat from fire or steam is applied, and the tobacco is allowed to ferment. This is said to result in a sweet and mild tobacco. Finally the cake is sliced. These slices must be broken apart, as by rubbing in a circular motion between one's palms, before the tobacco can be evenly packed into a pipe. FlavoringA typical mix of ingredients would be around 54 percent tobacco, 22 percent water, 8 percent alcohol (Glycerol/Solicitor) and the rest sugars and specific flavoring (e.g., cherry). is often added before the leaves are pressed. English Cavendish uses a dark flue or fire cured Virginia (DEC), which is steamed and then stored under pressure to permit it to cure and ferment for several days or weeks.  Corojo  Corojo is a type of tobacco used primarily in the making of cigars, originally grown in the Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba. Corojo was originally developed and grown by Diego Rodriguez at his farm or vega, Santa Ines del Corojo, and takes its name from the farm. It was used as a wrapper extensively for many years on Cuban cigars, but its susceptibility to various diseases, Blue mold in particular, caused the Cuban genetic engineers to develop various hybrid forms that would not only be disease-resistant, but would also display excellent wrapper qualities.  Criollo  Criollo is primarily used in the making of cigars. It was, by most accounts, one of the original Cuban tobaccos that emerged around the time of Columbus. The term means native seed, and thus a tobacco variety using the term, such as Dominican Criollo, may or may not have anything to do with the original Cuban seed nor the recent hybrid, Criollo '98.  Dokha  Dokha, is a tobacco originally grown in UAE, Iran, and other gulf states. Traditional dokha is 100% additive free tobacco. Dokha is Arabic for dizzy, which refers to the extremely high nicotine content of dokha. Dokha is not cured like many other commercial tobacco products and is minimally processed. The green leaves are dried and shredded into small flakes which are smoked through a pipe called a medwakh.  Ecuadorian Sumatra  Mr. Jose Aray Marin, founder of the Don Cervantes factory, developed the world-famous Ecuadoran Sumatra breed in 1967. It is now considered the world‚Äôs premium cigar wrapper leaf and is in demand by cigar manufacturers worldwide.  Habano  Habano cigar wrapper is a leaf grown from a Cuban seed, hence the word ‚ÄúHabano‚Äù or ‚ÄúHavano,‚Äù referring to Cuba‚Äôs capital. Habano tobacco wrapper is darker in colour, has a much spicier flavor, a richer aroma, and has been grown in Nicaragua‚Äôs Jalapa Valley and Estel√≠ since the 1990s.  Habano 2000  Habano 2000 is a cross between El Corojo, the standard wrapper leaf from the Vuelta Abajo, the Cuban region that many believe produces the best cigar tobacco in the world, and a tobacco called Bell 61-10, a mild cigarette tobacco that is more resistant to blue mold than cigar tobacco. The Cubans first crossed El Corojo and Bell 61-10 tobacco to create something they called Habana 2.1.1. Then they took the new mixture and crossed it again with El Corojo, arriving at Habano 2000.  Maduro  Maduro is a process for bringing out the sweetness of a tobacco leaf. Maduro is a Spanish word meaning \\"ripe.\\" Maduro wrappers come from fermenting tobacco in pilones at higher temperatures and with more humidity than other tobacco types.  Oriental Tobacco  Oriental tobacco is a sun- cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety (Nicotiana tabacum) that is grown in Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Lebanon, and North Macedonia. Oriental tobacco is frequently referred to as \\"Turkish tobacco\\", as these regions were all historically part of the Ottoman Empire. Many of the early brands of cigarettes were made mostly or entirely of Oriental tobacco (like Murad, Fatima...); today, its main use is in blends of pipe and especially cigarette tobacco (a typical American cigarette is a blend of bright Virginia, burley and Oriental).  Perique  Perhaps the most strongly flavored of all tobaccos is the Perique, from Saint James Parish, Louisiana (Paroisse de Saint-Jacques). When the Acadians made their way into this region in 1755, the Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes were cultivating a variety of tobacco with a distinctive flavor. A farmer called Pierre Chenet is credited with first turning this local tobacco into the Perique in 1824 through the technique of pressure-fermentation. Considered the truffle of pipe tobaccos, the Perique is used as a component of many blended pipe tobaccos, but is too strong to be smoked pure. At one time, the freshly moist Perique was also chewed, but none is now sold for this purpose. It is traditionally a pipe tobacco, and is still very popular with pipe-smokers, typically blended with pure Virginia to lend spice, strength, and coolness to the blend.  Shade tobacco  East Windsor, Connecticut It is not well known that the Northeastern US states of Connecticut and Massachusetts are also two of the most important tobacco- growing regions in the country. Long before Europeans arrived in the area, Native Americans cultivated tobacco along the banks of the Connecticut River. Today, the Connecticut River valley north of Hartford, Connecticut is known as \\"Tobacco Valley\\", and the fields and drying sheds are visible to travelers on the road to and from Bradley International Airport, the major Connecticut airport. Connecticut shade tobacco is grown under tents to protect plant leaves from direct sunlight. This imitates the conditions of tobacco plants growing in the shade of trees in tropical areas. The result is leaves of lighter color and of a more delicate structure. They are used as outer wrappers for some of the world's finest cigars. It is not entirely clear who introduced this method of growing tobacco, but it is likely that the New York firm of Schroeder & Bon or its founder Frederick A. Schroeder were instrumental in developing this agricultural innovation.See Robert T. Pan do (2003). Shrouded in Cheesecloth: the Demise of Shade Tobacco in Florida and Georgia. Master of Arts thesis. Florida State University. PP. 22 sq., available online at and Carl Wilhelm Schlemiel (1916‚Äî1918). Schlemiel's American Families of German Ancestry. Vol. 3. P. 370. Early Connecticut colonists acquired from the Native Americans the habit of smoking tobacco in pipes and began cultivating the plant commercially, even though the Puritans referred to it as the \\"evil weed\\". The plant was outlawed in Connecticut in 1650, but in the 19th century as cigar smoking began to be popular, tobacco farming became a major industry, employing farmers, laborers, local youths, southern African Americans, and migrant workers. Working conditions varied from backbreaking work for young local children, ages 13 and up, to backbreaking exploitation of migrants. Each tobacco plant yields only 18 leaves useful as cigar wrappers, and each leaf requires a great deal of individual manual attention during harvesting. The temperature in the curing sheds sometimes exceeds , and no work is done inside the sheds while the tobacco is being fired. In 1921, Connecticut tobacco production peaked, at under cultivation. The rise of cigarette smoking and the decline of cigar smoking have caused a corresponding decline in the demand for shade tobacco, reaching a minimum in 1992 of under cultivation. Since then, however, cigar smoking has become more popular again, and in 1997 tobacco farming had risen to . However, only of shade tobacco were harvested in the Connecticut Valley in 2006. Connecticut seed is being grown in Ecuador, where labor is very cheap. The industry has weathered some major catastrophes, including a devastating hailstorm in 1929, and an epidemic of brown spot fungus in 2000, but is now in danger of disappearing altogether, given the value of the land to real estate speculators. The older and much less labor-intensive Broad leaf plant, which produces an excellent Maduro wrapper as well as binder and filler for cigars, is increasing in area in the Connecticut Valley.  Thuoc lao  Thuoc lao is a nicotine-rich (although not as strong as mapacho) type of tobacco grown exclusively in Vietnam and is often smoked by Vietnamese rice farmers. It is most commonly smoked after a meal on a full stomach to aid in digestion, or along with green tea or local beer (most commonly the cheap \\"bia hoi\\"). A \\"hit\\" of thuoc lao is followed by a flood of nicotine to the bloodstream inducing strong dizziness that last several seconds. Even heavy smokers have had trouble with the intense volume of smoke and the side effects include nausea and vomiting.  Type 22  Type 22 tobacco is a classification of United States tobacco product as defined by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, effective date November 7, 1986. The definition states that type 22 tobacco is a type of dark fire-cured tobacco, known as Eastern District fire-cured, produced principally in a section east of the Tennessee River in southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee. Most type 22 tobacco in northern Tennessee is grown in Robertson and Montgomery County. Its principal use is in the manufacture of chewing tobacco.  White Burley  Harvested white burley in Cincinnati, Ohio. White Burley similar to Burley tobacco is the main component in chewing tobacco, American blend pipe tobacco, and American-style cigarettes. In 1865, George Webb of Brown County, Ohio planted Red Burley seeds he had purchased, and found that a few of the seedlings had a whitish, sickly look. He transplanted them to the fields anyway, where they grew into mature plants but retained their light color. The cured leaves had an exceedingly fine texture and were exhibited as a curiosity at the market in Cincinnati. The following year he planted ten acres (40,000 m¬≤) from seeds from those plants, which brought a premium at auction. The air- cured leaf was found to be mild tasting and more absorbent than any other variety. White Burley, as it was later called, became the main component in chewing tobacco, American blend pipe tobacco, and American-style cigarettes. The white part of the name is seldom used today, since red burley, a dark air- cured variety of the mid-19th century, no longer exists.  Wild tobacco  Wild tobacco is native to the southwestern United States, Mexico, and parts of South America. Its botanical name is Nicotiana rustica. In Australia Nicotiana benthamiana and Nicotiana gossei are two of several indigenous tobaccos still used in some areas. Nicotiana rustica is the most potent strain of tobacco known. It is commonly used for tobacco dust or pesticides.http://sres- associated.anu.edu.au/fpt/nwfp/pituri/pituri.html  Y1  Y1 is a strain of tobacco that was cross-bred by Brown & Williamson to obtain an unusually high nicotine content. It became controversial in the 1990s when the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) used it as evidence that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes. Y1 was developed by tobacco plant researcher James Chaplin, working under Dr. Jeffrey Wigand for Brown & Williamson (then a subsidiary of British American Tobacco) in the late 1970s. Chaplin, a director of the USDA Research Laboratory at Oxford, North Carolina, had described the need for a higher nicotine tobacco plant in the trade publication World Tobacco in 1977, and had bred a number of high-nicotine strains based on a hybrid of Nicotiana tabacum and Nicotiana rustica, but they were weak and would blow over in a strong wind. Only two grew to maturity; Y2, which \\"turned black in the drying barn and smelled like old socks,\\" and Y1, which was a success. B&W; brought the plants to California company DNA Plant Technology for additional modification, including making the plants male-sterile, a procedure that prevents competitors from reproducing the strain from seeds. DNA Plant Technology then smuggled the seeds to a B&W; subsidiary in Brazil. Y1 has a higher nicotine content than conventional flue- cured tobacco (6.5% versus 3.2--3.5%), but a comparable amount of tar, and does not affect taste or aroma. British American Tobacco (BAT) began to discuss the trialling of Y1 tobacco in 1991, despite it not being approved for use in the United States. B&W; promised in 1994 to stop using Y1, but at that time they had 7 million pounds of inventory, and continued to blend Y1 into their products until 1999.

He was born at the Ahsan Manzil Palace in Dhaka. He was the eldest son of Nawab Habibullah Bahadur and Shahryar Begum (the granddaughter of Nawab Khwaja Ahsanullah). He became the Nawab of Dhaka after his father's death in 1958. Early life Nawab Hasan Askari was born on 21 August 1921 to the aristocratic Nawab family of Dhaka, East Bengal. The family was descended from Kashmiri merchants who settled in Bengal for trade. He completed his early education from the maktab at the Ahsan Manzil Palace and later joined the Muslim High School. His mother died when he was only ten years old after which he was sent to study at the Aligarh School and College from where he completed his B.A in 1940. At Aligarh he was part of the cricket team and the captain of riding club and was also the recipient of the Quaid-e- Azam Award, an honour that bestowed upon him during Quaid-e-Azam's visit to Aligarh University. He graduated from Aligarh University in 1942 and joined the British Indian Army in 1944 as a commissioned officer. He then went on to join the 7th Cavalry Regiment Armored Corps and took part in action on the Burma Front against Japanese. He left the British Indian army after being injured in a battle in Burma. He joined Pakistan army after partition of India in 1948 and remained in the force until 1961. In 1946 he was engaged to Bilquis Shehzadi, daughter of Nawab Hafeezuddin Khan of the State of Surat. He was married in 1948 in Hyderabad where they were the guests of the Nizam of Hyderabad and the bridal party stayed in one of their palaces. They have one daughter and four sons. Nawab Hasan Askari served in the East Bengal Regiment. In 1949 he was transferred to the Nowshera Armored Corp and in 1950 joined Governor General's Body Guard as the First Adjutant when his uncle Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin K.C.I.E, C.I.E was the Governor General of Pakistan. In 1951 he returned to Dacca and served with the East Bengal Regiment in various parts of the country. In 1954 he was posted back to Rawalpindi and served with the 5th Regiment of the Armored Corp also known as the Probyns Horse regiment. He served between Rawalpindi and Manser Camp until 1959. The Last Nawab His father Nawab Khwaja Habibullah Bahadur died on 21 November 1958 and Nawab Hasan Askari became the last Nawab of Dacca on 22 November 1958. The army then transferred him to East Pakistan and he simultaneously served at the army's recruiting office in Dacca. Due to a heart problem in 1961, Nawab Hasan Askari requested to resign from the army. He contested the 1962 elections on a Muslim Leagur ticket and won a seat in the National Assembly of Pakistan. He was appointed minister of the provincial cabinet in East Pakistan with portfolios of communications, waterways and railways. He started the first rail car service in East Pakistan which was then followed in West Pakistan and is credited with having had started the work of the new railway system in Dacca. During the 1965 war he was the Chief Warden of Dacca and was later appointed Warden General of East Pakistan. He was awarded the Hilal-e-Khidmat by the then President Major General Ayub Khan in the 1960s for his services to the nation. He was the President of the East Pakistan Muslim League (Convention) until the liberation of Bangladesh. Khawaja Hasan Askari was the guardian of the various philanthropic institutions like the Nawab Salimullah Orphanage, madrassah's supported by his family, Sir Salimullah Medical College, Ahsanullah Engineering College also supported by Dhaka Nawab Family. He was the director of P.I.A, I.D.B.P and various Banks, P.I.D.C, President of the Pakistan Jute Mills Association, Dhaka Club and Dhaka Race Club, East Pakistan Cricket Board. He was also a member of the Chamber of Commerce. Liberation of Bangladesh and Aftermath He remained in Dhaka till 1975. Towards the end of 1974 at the request of then Prime Minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who was visiting Dhaka, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman agreed upon Nawab Hasan Askari leaving Dacca for Karachi. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was of the opinion that the Nawab of Dhaka must stay in Bangladesh: in his country and with his people. In January 1975, Nawab Hassan Askari and his family left Bangladesh for Karachi. He died in Karachi on 9 August 1984 and has been laid to rest in Karachi at the Defence Army Graveyard where his wife Begum Bilquis Askari was also laid to rest in 1995.

His attention to the process of painting and investigations into systems and spatial fields explores both non-narrative abstraction and the physicality of modernism. In Winters‚Äô work, abstract processes give way to forms with real word agency that recall mathematical concepts and cybernetics, as well as natural and scientific worlds. Life and work Originally from Brooklyn, NY, Terry Winters studied at the Pratt Institute where he earned his B.F.A. in 1971. Interested in Minimalism and its exploration of painting‚Äôs conventions, Winters began to think against the reductive tendencies of the then dominant Formalist abstraction while maintaining hard-won modernist sensibility of non-narrative abstraction.Kimmelman, Michael. \\"Art View; Cells, Crystals, Bugs, and Shells, Rendered in Paint.\\" New York Times, 8 March 1992. For ten years following his graduation from the Pratt Institute Winters worked quietly and deliberately, not showing his work publicly and watched quietly by a small group of fellow artists, including Jasper Johns. During this time, Winters explored his interest in Process Art, collecting books on pigments such as Pliny the Elder‚Äôs Natural History. These studies, combined with his interest in building paintings ‚Ä≥from the ground up‚Ä≥, led him to explore making his own pigments, introducing him to the study of biology and mineralogy (and eventually to empirical information systems) and these fields‚Äô associative and metaphoric potential.Phillips, Lisa. ‚Ä≥The Self Similar.‚Ä≥ In Terry Winters. New York: Whitney Museum of American Art, 1992. In 1977, Winters had a significant encounter with landscape while he lived in New Mexico to help construct the earthwork Lightning Field by Walter de Maria. By the late 1970s, Winters was using pigment to investigate the referential nature of painting. Soon after, his focus shifted to the illusionism inevitable in painting, how mark making and process create illusions that give way to non-representational spatial dimension. This approach is evident in Winters‚Äô first exhibition in 1982 at Sonnabend Gallery. Here, gestures and modules create complex paths and grounds that premiere Winters‚Äô nuanced painting method.Juncosa, Enrique. ‚Ä≥Thought as Image.‚Ä≥ In Terry Winters. Valencia, Spain: La Imprenta, Comunicaci√≥n Gr√°fica, 1998. 17-18. Terry Winters has since exhibited widely, joining a group of contemporaries ‚Äì such as Tony Cragg, Bill Jensen, and Stephen Mueller ‚Äì engaging with organic abstraction and constantly changing thought on visuality impacted by evolving technology. Throughout the 1990s and onward the scale of Winters‚Äô work and its visual complexity has grown considerably. Continuing to take from the natural sciences and information systems, amongst other subject matters, the construction of his compositions has transitioned from occupied fields to plaited grids and networks that offer unpredictable images.‚Ä≥Terry Winters in conversation with Phong Bui, David Levi Strauss, & Peter Lamborn Wilson.‚Ä≥ The Brooklyn Rail, December 2008/January 2009. 22-25. Winters reforms his subjects to maintain their resonance and referentiality ‚Äì what one sees in his compositions is ambiguously familiar ‚Äì while waxing to an analog for the act of their making.Kertess, Klaus. ‚Ä≥Metaphorically Painting.‚Ä≥ In Terry Winters. Luzern, Switzerland: Kunstmuseum Luzern, 1985. 13-14. Exhibitions The paintings, drawings, and prints of Terry Winters have been the subject of numerous solo and group exhibitions, including major retrospectives at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Sonnabend Gallery,1982 The first solo show for Terry Winters, this exhibition established his reputation as an accomplished and distinctive painter and draughtsman. Previously unknown outside of underground circles of artists and collectors, this debut presented his nuanced approach to painting ‚Äì including his evolving lexicon of biomorphic forms and honed drafting skills ‚Äì as a welcome tonic for the atmosphere of painting at the time. Whitney Museum of American Art, 1992 This early 1990s survey demonstrates a perceptible evolution in Terry Winters‚Äô work as he frequently shifts from large to small scales and reorients his compositions. The exhibition outlines Winters‚Äô experimentation with printmaking and drawing after 1986 that realized new tonal and mark making potential in his work.Axsom, Richard. ‚Ä≥The Philosopher‚Äôs Stone: The Prints of Terry Winters.‚Ä≥ In Terry Winters Prints 1992 ‚Äì 1998.

Mining graphics and functional analytical tools, diagrams and schema like the architectural grid appear abstracted and occupied by ambiguous forms analogous to the outside world (Dumb Compass, 1985). A centerpiece of the exhibition, Spine Series (1980) simultaneously demonstrates Winters‚Äô interest in the construction of the painting and his investigations into visuality. Later work in the exhibition features complex but singular forms emerging from fields and grounds to take on emotional dimension, evoking consciousness and sensuality (Tone, 1989).Shiff, Richard. ‚Ä≥Manual Imagination.‚Ä≥ In Terry Winters Paintings, Drawings, Prints 1994 ‚Äì 2004.

Tobacco is the agricultural product of the leaves of plants in the genus Nicotiana. All species of Nicotiana contain the addictive drug nicotine‚Äîa stimulant and sedative contained in all parts of the plants except the seeds‚Äîwhich occurs in varying amounts depending on the species and variety cultivated. See types of tobacco and curing of tobacco for more information. The vast majority of commercially available tobacco is derived from the species Nicotiana tabacum, although it is also produced from Nicotiana alata, and to a lesser extent Nicotiana clevelandii, Nicotiana longiflora, and Nicotiana rustica, among others. N. rustica in particular contains much more nicotine than N. tabacum and other species of Nicotiana, and forms the basis of a number of unique tobacco products, including several preparations used in Latin American shamanic ceremonies. Once tobacco has been grown, harvested, cured, and processed, it is used to produce a number of different products. These are most often consumable; however, tobacco and the nicotine derived from it are also used to create pesticides. Tobacco products can generally be divided into two types: smoked tobacco (see tobacco smoking) and smokeless tobacco. An expert in tobacco and tobacco products ‚Äî especially pipes, pipe tobacco, and cigars‚Äîincluding their procurement and sale, is called a tobacconist. The health effects of tobacco consumption are discussed in health effects of tobacco.  Consumable   Chewing tobacco  A pouch of Red Man loose leaf chewing tobacco and Oliver Twist tobacco bits/pellets. Chewing is one of the oldest methods of consuming tobacco leaves. Native Americans in both North and South America chewed the fresh leaves of the tobacco plant, frequently mixed with lime. = Western chewing tobacco = Modern American- style chewing tobacco (colloquially known as chew or chaw, especially in the American South and Midwest) is produced from cured and often fermented tobacco, usually dampened and mixed with some type of sweetener. (Often molasses.) Twist tobacco may be an exception in this case, as many brands of twist are not sweetened. In using chewing tobacco‚Äîat least types other than tobacco pellets‚Äîthe consumer usually deposits the tobacco between the cheek and teeth and lightly macerates and sucks the tobacco to allow its juices to flow. Thus when chewing, it is common to spit and discard excess saliva caused by the release of juices from the tobacco, justifying the existence of the spittoon, or cuspidor. The popularity of American-style chewing tobacco and the associated spittoon reached its height in the American Midwest during the late 19th century; however, as cigarettes became the predominant form of tobacco consumption the spittoon gradually fell into disuse across the United States. While spittoons are often a rarity in modern society, loose leaf chewing tobacco can still be purchased at many convenience stores or from tobacconists throughout the United States and Canada. Chewing tobacco endemic to the Western world is manufactured in several forms:  Loose leaf  Loose leaf chewing tobacco, also known as scrap, is perhaps the most common contemporary form of American-style chewing tobacco. It consists of cut or shredded strips of tobacco leaf, and is usually sold in sealed pouches or bags lined with foil. Often sweetened, loose leaf chew may have a tacky texture. (Though there are also unflavored or \\"natural\\" loose leaf chews. However, these are far less common.) Popular, modern brands of scrap sold in North America include Red Man, Levi Garrett, Jackson's Apple Jack (made by Swisher International), Beech-Nut (formerly made by Lorillard; now Reynolds American), and Stoker's.  Pellets  Pellets or bits consist of tobacco rolled into small pellets. They are often packaged in portable tins. Tobacco pellets are used in the same manner as snus, in that they are placed between the lip and gum, and that spitting is typically unnecessary. It is suggested that the user may periodically chew the pellets lightly in order to release additional juice, flavor, and/or nicotine. Tobacco bits are almost exclusively produced under the Northern European Oliver Twist and Piccanell brands. They are thus‚Äîlike snus‚Äîpreponderant in the Scandinavian region.  Plug  Levi Garrett and Cannon Ball brands of plug chewing tobacco. Plug tobacco is made up of tobacco leaves that have been pressed together and bound by some type of sweetener, resulting in a dense, square tobacco mass. (Some compare the look of plug tobacco to a brownie or similar pastry.) One can then bite directly from the mass or slice the tobacco into portions. Some types of plug may either be chewed or smoked in a tobacco pipe, and some are exclusive to one method of consumption or the other. Plug tobacco was once a much more common product, available to many American consumers during the 19th century. Two tobacco companies that historically manufactured plug are Liggett and Lorillard. (The latter was known for its Climax brand of plug.) Modern brands of chewing plug include \\"rustic\\" and simple packaging, as is the case with popular plugs like Apple Sun Cured, Brown's Mule, Cannon Ball, Cup, Days Work, and Days O Work. Some well-known loose leaf chewing tobacco brands, such as Red Man and Levi Garrett, have their own versions of plug tobacco, as well.  Twist  Twist or rope tobacco is made up of rope-like strands of tobacco that have been twisted together and cured in that position, afterwards being cut. Some types of twist may either be chewed or smoked in a tobacco pipe, and some are exclusive to one method or the other. Unlike other types of chewing tobacco, twist tobacco isn't always a sweetened product, and may be devoid of molasses. = Indian chewing tobacco = Different types of chewing tobacco are endemic to the Indian subcontinent.  Gutkha  Gutkha (also transliterated gutka) is a chewing tobacco product popular in India and surrounding regions. It is a mixture of betel nuts, tobacco, paraffin wax, catechu, and slaked lime. It is similar to mava.  Mava  Mava (also transliterated mawa) is a chewing tobacco product popular in Gujarat, India, made with a mixture of betel nut, calcium carbonate and flavoured tobacco. It is also known faki or masala. It is similar to gutkha.  Cigars  Several different cigars. A cigar is a tightly rolled bundle of dried and fermented tobacco which is ignited so that its smoke may be drawn into the smoker's mouth and expelled; thus the cigar is generally \\"puffed on\\" (like a tobacco pipe) as opposed to being inhaled from (as is the case with cigarettes). The cigar is one of the oldest methods of preparing tobacco for consumption, some of the first cigars being introduced to Europeans as rolls of tobacco smoked by the Ta√≠no of 15th century Cuba. There are numerous varieties of cigar, differentiated by their respective size, shape, color, and composition. Some products developed from the cigar are, however, markedly different from the traditional product. (Cigarillos, blunts, and little cigars, for instance.) Cigarettes may be the most notable example of this deviation, although they do, in a sense, represent a category of their own. Tobacciana associated with cigars include cigar tubes, cigar boxes, cigar holders (also known as \\"cigar mouthpieces\\"; cf. cigarette holder), cigar cutters (including cigar scissors or shears), cigar cases, and humidors. = Blunts = Blunts are wide, somewhat stubby versions of cigars. Most, if not all, are machine-made \\"domestic cigars\\" created from homogenized or reconstituted tobacco. They are usually inexpensive, and only lightly fermented. = Cigarillos = Two cigarillos. Cigarillos are long, thin cigars, somewhat larger than cigarettes but smaller than regular cigars. They may be fitted into a cigarillo holder in order to be smoked, though they are most often smoked without such a device. Using a cutting tool in order to prepare a cigarillo is less common than with larger cigars, as they are often open on both ends. Cigarillos may be machine-made, although many hand-made versions do exist; the latter are often produced by premium cigar manufacturers. In modern-day America, machine-made cigarillos can be used as marijuana cigars in a manner similar to machine made-large cigars. = Little cigars = A little cigar is a cigar that is the same size as a cigarette‚Äîoften featuring a filter‚Äîhowever, it still retains its identity as a cigar because it is wrapped in a tobacco leaf, or more often a paper wrapper made of tobacco pulp, reconstituted tobacco or homogenized tobacco. Flavored little cigars are available on the market as well. Flavored little cigars have been steadily increasing in popularity among cigar smokers. Manufacturers like Prime Time have been offering flavored little cigars since 1993.  Roll- your-own cigars  Zig-Zag cigar wraps. Several manufacturers have begun producing cigar wraps. Cigar wraps consist of tobacco leaf which can then be used with a tobacco blend to produce a hand-rolled cigar.  Cigarettes  Two unlit, filtered German cigarettes. Cigarettes are a product consumed through smoking and manufactured out of cured and finely cut tobacco leaves and reconstituted tobacco, often combined with other additives,[1] then rolled or stuffed into a paper-wrapped cylinder (generally less than 120 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter). = Bidis = = Kreteks = Kreteks are cigarettes made with a complex blend of tobacco, cloves and a flavoring 'sauce'. = Roll-Your-Own = Roll-Your-Own (RYO) or hand-rolled cigarettes, are very popular particularly in European countries. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers and filters all bought separately. They are usually much cheaper to make.  Creamy snuff  Creamy snuff is a tobacco paste, consisting of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, spearmint, menthol, and camphor, and sold in a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Dentobac, Tona, Ganesh. It is locally known as \\"mishri\\" in some parts of Maharashtra. According to the U.S. NIH-sponsored 2002 Smokeless Tobacco Fact Sheet. The same factsheet also mentions that it is \\"often used to clean teeth\\". The manufacturer recommends letting the paste linger in the mouth before rinsing.  Dipping tobacco  Four cans (or tins) of dipping tobacco/moist snuff. Dipping tobacco, also known as dip, moist snuff (or simply snuff), American moist snuff, or spit tobacco, is a form of smokeless tobacco. (It should also be noted that the term smokeless tobacco itself is a broad one which, while generally referring to all tobacco products which do not require smoking (e.g. nasal snuff, chewing tobacco, snus, etc.), is popularly used to refer specifically to dipping tobacco.) Dip is sometimes also called chew or chaw; because of this, it is commonly confused with chewing tobacco. Because it is sometimes called snuff or moist snuff, it can also be confused with nasal or dry snuff. Instead of literally chewing on dipping tobacco, as is the case with chewing tobacco, a small clump of dip is \\"pinched\\" out of its container and placed between the lower or upper lip and gums. While it is most common to place the tobacco between the lower lip and gums, utilizing the upper lip for this purpose‚Äîin a manner more common to snus‚Äîis known as an \\"upper decker\\". In modern times, dipping tobacco is usually packaged in metal or plastic tins, sometimes with the addition of fiberboard. Some brands are packaged into \\"tubs\\", or deeper hand-held containers. Dipping tobacco comes in several varieties. Many dipping tobacco producers also manufacture pouches of dipping tobacco, making the habit cleaner and more convenient. The following are standard cut sizes, but some brands can still vary in size. = Cut sizes =  Extra long cut  Extra long cuts are the longest cut size. Copenhagen and Grizzly both make an extra long cut natural variety.  Wide cut  Wide cuts have thicker strands than all other cuts of dipping tobacco. Currently, wide cut is only manufactured by Grizzly.  Long cut  Long cuts are easier to manage than fine cuts (a smaller granular sized dip - in regard to ease of grabbing the tobacco and keeping it comfortably in mouth). This is the most common cut of tobacco.  Mid cut  Mid cut sized dipping tobacco is comparable to small granules at about 1 mm cubed. A couple of mid cuts were on the smokeless tobacco market but have since been discontinued.  Fine cut  Fine cut comes in granules slightly larger than sand or coffee grounds.  Snuff  Snuff or simply moist snuff looks similar to dirt or sand in terms of granular size. Extremely small cut.  Pouches  Pouches hold fine cut tobacco in a small teabag-like pouch for convenience. Pouches are typically about the same size, but one brand, Skoal, also offers a smaller pouch called Bandits.  Dissolvable tobacco  Dissolvable tobacco is a recent introduction, entering mainstream use in the later half of the 2000s (decade). The product consists of finely-processed tobacco which is developed in such a way as to allow the substance to dissolve on the tongue or in the mouth. Camel tobacco is the major purveyor of dissolvable tobacco products, with three varieties, including strips, sticks and orbs, however companies such as Ariva and Stonewall have also been successful with such manufacturing, marketing compressed tobacco lozenges.  Dokha  Dokha is a tobacco of Iranian origin mixed with leaves, bark, and herbs. It is traditionally smoked in a midwakh.  Gutka  Gutka (also spelled gutkha, guttkha, guthka) is a preparation of crushed betel nut, tobacco, and sweet or savory flavorings. It is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries. A mild stimulant, it is sold across India in small, individual-size packets. It is consumed much like chewing tobacco, and like chewing tobacco it is considered responsible for oral cancer and other severe negative health effects. Used by millions of adults, it is also marketed to children. Some packaging does not mention tobacco as an ingredient, and some brands are pitched as candies - featuring packaging with children's faces and are brightly colored. Some are chocolate-flavored, and some are marketed as breath fresheners.  Kizami  Kizami is a tobacco product produced in Japan and intended for smoking in Japanese kiseru pipes.  Iqmik  Iqmik is an Alaskan smokeless tobacco product used with punk ash. It is most common among natives. Nicotine is freebased with caustic ash and thus iqmik is more addicting and potent than regular chewing tobacco.  Mu'assel  Mu'assel or shisha tobacco. Mu'assel, shisha tobacco, hookah tobacco, or simply shisha is a somewhat moist form of tobacco that is mixed with glycerin and coagulated with molasses or other sticky sweeteners and has been popular in the Middle-East for centuries. It is often smoked with a hookah. Its names include ma'sal (also romanized as the aforementioned mu'assel), tumb√¢k, and jur√¢k. Naswar Naswar is a type of smokeless tobacco popular in Afghanistan and surrounding countries. It is moist and powdered, and lime or juniper is added for flavor.  Pipe tobacco   Snuff  Several types and consistencies of nasal/dry snuff. Snuff is a generic term for fine-ground smokeless tobacco products. Originally the term referred only to dry snuff, a fine tan dust popular mainly in the 18th century. In the U.S., this is often called \\"Scotch Snuff\\", a folk-etymology derivation of the scorching process used to dry the cured tobacco by the factory. Snuff powder originated in the UK town of Great Harwood and was famously ground in the town's monument prior to local distribution and transport further up north to Scotland. European (dry) snuff is intended to be shallowly \\"sniffed\\" (technically insufflated) into the nose, where nicotine is absorbed through the mucous membranes in the nostrils. Snuff is not deeply \\"snorted\\" (such as in the way cocaine is) because snuff shouldn't get past the nose, i.e. into sinuses, throat or lungs. Generally a small portion of dry snuff is either pinched in the fingers or laid out on the wrist of the user, from where it is sniffed. European snuff comes in several varieties: plain, toast (fine ground and very dry), \\"medicated\\" (with menthol, camphor, eucalyptus, etc.), scented, and Schmalzler, a German variety. The major brand names of European snuffs are: Toque Tobacco (UK), Bernards (Germany), Fribourg & Treyer (UK), Gawith (UK), Gawith Hoggarth] (UK), Hedges (UK), Lotzbeck (Germany), McChrystal's (UK), P√∂schl (Germany), Toque (UK), and Wilsons of Sharrow (UK). Although less common, American (dry) snuff also exists, and is typically used orally in a similar manner to moist snuff. It is placed in the lower lip, and is most popular in the South. Brands include: Carhart's CC, Peach Sweet, and Tube Rose, among others. American (moist) snuff is a term synonymous with dipping tobacco or \\"dip\\".  Snus  A can (or tin) of Skruf brand loose (Swedish: l√∂s) snus, with some formed into a pris or prilla. Snus is a type of smokeless tobacco originating from and popular in Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. It differs from moist snuff or chewing tobacco in that it is made from steam-cured tobacco leaves, rather than fire-cured ones, and its health effects are markedly different, with epidemiological studies showing lower rates of cancer and other tobacco-related health problems than cigarettes, American \\"chewing tobacco\\", Indian gutka or African- type tobacco products. Prominent Swedish brands are Swedish Match, General, Ettan, and Tre Ankare. In many Scandinavian countries, snus comes either in loose powder form, to be pressed into a small ball (called \\"baking\\" the snus) by hand or with the use of a special tool, or in small bags (called \\"portioned snus\\" form). Both are suitable for placing under one of the lips, most often the upper. Portioned snus is in particular a popular type because it keeps loose tobacco from becoming stuck between the user's teeth; they also produce less spittle when in contact with mucous membranes inside the mouth which extends the usage time of the tobacco product. However, loose form snus tends to deliver more nicotine than portioned form.  Tobacco edibles  Tobacco gum, like dissolvable tobacco, is a recent introduction - a type of chewing gum which, like nicotine gum provides nicotine through oral absorption. However, the difference between nicotine gum and tobacco gum is that tobacco gum is made from finely powdered tobacco mixed with a gum base, rather than freebase nicotine. The only current company that produces tobacco gum is Firebreak. Non-consumable  Tobacco water  Tobacco water is a traditional organic insecticide used in domestic gardening. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled the mixture can be applied as a spray, or 'painted' on to the leaves of garden plants, where it will prove deadly to insects. Basque angulero fishermen kill immature eels (elvers) in an infusion of tobacco leaves before parboiling them in salty water for transportation to market as angulas, a seasonal delicacy.Angulas  Topical tobacco paste  Topical tobacco paste is sometimes recommended as a treatment for wasp, hornet, fire ant, scorpion, and bee stings.Beverly Sparks, \\"Stinging and Biting Pests of People\\" Extension Entomologist of the University of Georgia College of Agricultural & Environmental Sciences Cooperative Extension Service. An amount equivalent to the contents of a cigarette is mashed in a cup with about a 0.5 to 1 teaspoon of water to make a paste that is then applied to the affected area. Paste has a diameter of and may need to be moistened in dry weather. If made and applied immediately, complete remission is common within 20‚Äì30 minutes, at which point the paste can be removed. The next day there may be a some residual itching, but virtually no swelling or redness. There seems to be no scientific evidence, as yet, that this common home remedy works to relieve pain. For about 2 percent of people, allergic reactions can be life-threatening and require emergency treatment. For more on this, see bee stings.

If f is a complex- valued holomorphic function germ then the Milnor number of f, denoted Œº(f), is either a nonnegative integer, or is infinite. It can be considered both a geometric invariant and an algebraic invariant. This is why it plays an important role in algebraic geometry and singularity theory.  Definition  Consider a holomorphic complex function germ : f : (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0) \\\\ and denote by \\\\mathcal{O}_n the ring of all function germs (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0). Every level of a function is a complex hypersurface in \\\\mathbb{C}^n, therefore we will call f a hypersurface singularity. Assume it is an isolated singularity: in case of holomorphic mappings we say that a hypersurface singularity f is singular at 0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^n if its gradient abla f is zero at 0 . A singular point is isolated if it is the only singular point in a sufficiently small neighbourhood. In particular, the multiplicity of the gradient : \\\\mu(f) = \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mathcal{O}_n/ abla f is finite. This number \\\\mu(f) is the Milnor number of singularity f at 0.  Geometric interpretation  Milnor originally introduced \\\\mu(f) in geometric terms in the following way. All fibers f^{-1}(c) for values c close to 0 are nonsingular manifolds of real dimension 2(n-1). Their intersection with a small open disc D_{\\\\epsilon} centered at 0 is a smooth manifold F called the Milnor fiber. Up to diffeomorphism F does not depend on c or \\\\epsilon if they are small enough. It is also diffeomorphic to the fiber of the Milnor fibration map. The Milnor fiber F is a smooth manifold of dimension 2(n-1) and has the same homotopy type as a bouquet of \\\\mu(f) spheres S^{n-1}. This is to say that its middle Betti number b_{n-1}(F) is equal to the Milnor number and it has homology of a point in dimension less than n-1. For example, a complex plane curve near every singular point z_0 has its Milnor fiber homotopic to a wedge of \\\\mu_{z_0}(f) circles (Milnor number is a local property, so it can have different values at different singular points). Thus we have equalities :Milnor number = number of spheres in the wedge = middle Betti number of F = degree of the map z\\\\to \\\\frac{{ abla} f(z)}{\\\\{ abla} f(z)\\\\} on S_\\\\epsilon = multiplicity of the gradient abla f Another way of looking at Milnor number is by perturbation. We say that a point is a degenerate singular point, or that f has a degenerate singularity, at z_0 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^n if z_0 is a singular point and the Hessian matrix of all second order partial derivatives has zero determinant at z_0: : \\\\det\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 f}{\\\\partial z_i \\\\partial z_j} \\\\right)_{1 \\\\le i \\\\le j \\\\le n}^{z = z_0} =0. We assume that f has a degenerate singularity at 0. We can speak about the multiplicity of this degenerate singularity by thinking about how many points are infinitesimally glued. If we now perturb the image of f in a certain stable way the isolated degenerate singularity at 0 will split up into other isolated singularities which are non-degenerate! The number of such isolated non-degenerate singularities will be the number of points that have been infinitesimally glued. Precisely, we take another function germ g which is non-singular at the origin and consider the new function germ h := f + Œµg where Œµ is very small. When Œµ = 0 then h = f. The function h is called the morsification of f. It is very difficult to compute the singularities of h, and indeed it may be computationally impossible. This number of points that have been infinitesimally glued, this local multiplicity of f, is exactly the Milnor number of f. Further contributions give meaning to Milnor number in terms of dimension of the space of versal deformations, i.e. the Milnor number is the minimal dimension of parameter space of deformations that carry all information about initial singularity.  Algebraic interpretation  Using some algebraic techniques we can calculate the Milnor number of f effortlessly. By \\\\mathcal{O} denote the ring of function germs (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0). By J_f denote the Jacobian ideal of f: : J_f := \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial z_i} : 1 \\\\le i \\\\le n \\\\right\\\\rangle. The local algebra of f is then given by the quotient algebra : \\\\mathcal{A}_f := \\\\mathcal{O} / J_f. Notice that this quotient space will actually be a vector space, although it may not be finite-dimensional. The Milnor number is then equal to the complex dimension of the local algebra: : \\\\mu(f) = \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{C}} \\\\mathcal{A}_f \\\\ . It follows from Hilbert's Nullstellensatz that \\\\mu(f) is finite if and only if the origin is an isolated critical point of f; that is, there is a neighbourhood of 0 in \\\\mathbb{C}^n such that the only critical point of f inside that neighbourhood is at 0.  Examples  Here we give some worked examples in two variables. Working with only one is too simple and does not give a feel for the techniques, whereas working with three variables can be quite tricky. Two is a nice number. Also we stick to polynomials. If f is only holomorphic and not a polynomial, then we could have worked with the power series expansion of f.  1  Consider a function germ with a non-degenerate singularity at 0, say f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2. The Jacobian ideal is just \\\\langle 2x, 2y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle . We next compute the local algebra: : \\\\mathcal{A}_f = \\\\mathcal{O} / \\\\langle x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle . To see why this is true we can use Hadamard's lemma which says that we can write any function h\\\\in\\\\mathcal{O} as : h(x,y) = k + xh_1(x,y) + yh_2(x,y) for some constant k and functions h_1 and h_2 in \\\\mathcal{O} (where either h_1 or h_2 or both may be exactly zero). So, modulo functional multiples of x and y, we can write h as a constant. The space of constant functions is spanned by 1, hence \\\\mathcal{A}_f = \\\\langle 1 \\\\rangle It follows that Œº(f) = 1. It is easy to check that for any function germ g with a non-degenerate singularity at 0 we get Œº(g) = 1. Note that applying this method to a non-singular function germ g we get Œº(g) = 0.  2  Let f(x,y) = x^3 + xy^2, then : \\\\mathcal{A}_f = \\\\mathcal{O} / \\\\langle 3x^2 + y^2, xy \\\\rangle = \\\\langle 1, x, y, x^2 \\\\rangle . So in this case \\\\mu(f) = 4.  3  One can show that if f(x,y) = x^2y^2 + y^3 then \\\\mu(f) = \\\\infty. This can be explained by the fact that f is singular at every point of the x-axis.  Versal Deformations  Let f have finite Milnor number Œº, and let g_1,\\\\ldots, g_{\\\\mu} be a basis for the local algebra, considered as a vector space. Then a miniversal deformation of f is given by : F : (\\\\mathbb{C}^n \\\\times \\\\mathbb{C}^{\\\\mu},0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0) , : F(z,a) := f(z) + a_1g_1(z) + \\\\cdots + a_{\\\\mu}g_{\\\\mu}(z) , where (a_1,\\\\dots,a_{\\\\mu})\\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^{\\\\mu}. These deformations (or unfoldings) are of great interest in much of science. Invariance We can collect function germs together to construct equivalence classes. One standard equivalence is A-equivalence. We say that two function germs f,g : (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0) are A-equivalent if there exist diffeomorphism germs \\\\phi : (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C}^n,0) and \\\\psi : (\\\\mathbb{C},0) \\\\to (\\\\mathbb{C},0) such that f \\\\circ \\\\phi = \\\\psi \\\\circ g: there exists a diffeomorphic change of variable in both domain and range which takes f to g. The Milnor number does not offer a complete invariant for function germs. We do have that if f and g are A-equivalent then Œº(f) = Œº(g). The converse is false: there exist function germs f and g with Œº(f) = Œº(g) which are not A-equivalent. To see this consider f(x,y) = x^3+y^3 and g(x,y) = x^2+y^5. We have \\\\mu(f) = \\\\mu(g) = 4 but f and g are clearly not A-equivalent since the Hessian matrix of f is equal to zero while that of g is not (and the rank of the Hessian is an A-invariant, as is easy to see).

History  Kusapat, one of the oldest villages of Artsakh, was founded in the 15th century by Armenian Prince Atabek Hasan- Jalalyan (1411), the fifth son of Prince Jalal III of the Hasan Jalalyan dynasty. Being the youngest son, Atabek inherited his father's fiefdom that was on the outskirts of ancestral domains, and the older son of Jalalyan inherited Vank fortress (today Gandzasar monastery). From the old fortress village got its name of Kisapat, that in local Armenian dialect means \\"half of the wall\\". By Prince Atabek of Jraberd started the Atabekyans line and Kusapat with seven surrounding villages became the ancestral domain of their princely house. At the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century in Kusapat lived the famous , who was one of the leaders of the Artsakh Armenians and did a lot for the establishment of Russian rule in Karabakh after the Russo- Persian War (1804‚Äì13). Kusapat was badly damaged during the Nagorno-Karabakh War. On 7 July 1992 the village was captured and destroyed by the Azerbaijani army.

She lives and works in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Early life and education Katharina Fritsch was born on February 14, 1956 in Essen, West Germany. Fritsch first studied history and art history at the University of M√ºnster and, in 1977, transferred to Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf where she was a student of Fritz Schwegler until 1984. Work Katharina Fritsch is known for her sculptures and installations that reinvigorate familiar objects with a jarring and uncanny sensibility. Her works' iconography is drawn from many different sources, including Christianity, art history and folklore. She attracted international attention for the first time in the mid-1980s with life-size works such as a true-to-scale elephant. Fritsch's art is often concerned with the psychology and expectations of visitors to a museum. Gary Garrels wrote that ‚ÄúOne of the remarkable features of Fritsch‚Äôs work is its ability both to capture the popular imagination by its immediate appeal and to be a focal point for the specialized discussions of the contemporary art world. This all too infrequent meeting point is at the center of her work, as it addresses the ambiguous and difficult relationships between artists and the public and between art and its display‚Äîthat is, the role of art and exhibitions and of the museum in the late twentieth century.‚Äù Gary Garrels, ‚ÄúKatharina Fritsch: An Introduction,‚Äù in Katharina Fritsch (San Francisco: San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 1996), 12. The special role colour plays in Fritsch's work has roots in her childhood visits to her grandfather, a salesman for Faber-Castell art supplies, whose garage was well-stocked with his wares.Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today Moma. Her most recognized works are Rattenk√∂nig/Rat King (1993), a giant circle of black polyester rats, included in the Venice Biennale in 1999. Other works include M√∂nch (Monk) (2003), a stoic, monochromatic male figure, made of solid polyester with a smooth, matte black surface; Figurengruppe / Group of Figures (2006-2008), an installation of nine elements; and Hahn/Cock (2010), a 14 ft (4.3m) cockerel in ultramarine blue to be shown on London's Trafalgar Square Fourth plinth from July 2013 to January 2015.Mark Brown (January 14, 2011), Fourth plinth at Trafalgar Square gets (no sniggering) a 14ft blue cock The Guardian. In her working process, Fritsch combines the techniques of traditional sculpture with those of industrial production. While many of her early works were handcrafted, Fritsch now makes only the models for her sculptures and then hands these over to a factory for production, to \\"near- pathological specifications\\". White Cube, London. She uses these models to create moulds, from which the final sculptures are cast in materials such as plaster, polyester and aluminium. Many are made as editions, meaning that multiple casts are taken from one mould.http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate- modern/exhibition/katharina-fritsch For the duration of some of her exhibitions, Fritsch has made her multiples available for sale at the respective museums. When working with human forms, Fritsch often collaborates with a model named Frank Fenstermacher. One of her muses, he ‚Äústands for the generic ‚Äòman‚Äô‚Äù in works such as her three ‚Äòbad‚Äô men: The Monch, the Doktor and the Handler. Fritsch explains her prolonged working relationship with Frank in terms of expression: \\"Somehow Frank's able to express what I want to express. I don't know why. Maybe he looks a little bit like my father, or like me. And he's a kind of actor. It's very strange how he can change from one character to another without appearing to do anything. He's always the man.\\" Fritsch's process in creating human figures is similar to her animal or object creations, except a live human is involved. She takes photographs of the model, trying out ideas and recording the details of the model's position. In the creation of the mold, she and her plaster technicians cover the model in vaseline and create the mold on top. After a dramatic, near death situation in which Frank was covered in too much plaster and turned blue, with his head ‚Äúlolling forwards‚Äù Fritsch has made fully body casts from mannequins. She still uses human models for the face and hands of her figures. After Fritsch is happy with the plaster mold, she uses silicon to make a negative model and then polyester to create a positive form from the silicon. The different pieces are painstakingly put together because ‚Äúthe surface has to be absolutely perfect.‚Äù Fritsch then paints or sprays the sculpture to finish it. In her work, Fritsch has been credited in continuing the work of Marcel Duchamp by responding to his ideas and change viewers‚Äô perceptions of them. For example, Fritsch's first major piece in the Museum of Modern Art's collection was Black Table with Table Ware (1985). It, outside of a museum, could be seen as an everyday object but it is ‚Äústrangely symmetrical‚Äù and placed in a museum context, changing the viewer's approach to it, much like Duchamp. In 2001, Fritsch was appointed Professor of Sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts, M√ºnster, a post she held until 2010. She is currently Professor of Sculpture at Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. Exhibitions Fritsch showed her first sculptures in 1979. Her international breakthrough came in 1984 at D√ºsseldorf's ‚ÄòVon hier aus‚Äô (From Here On) exhibition.

He played college football at the College of William & Mary in Virginia. Thompson was a standout athlete at his high school in New Jersey. He continued playing football at William & Mary between 1944 and 1948 ‚Äì his career was interrupted by a year of service in the U.S. military during World War II ‚Äì and helped the team to a series of winning records and bowl appearances. He was named an all-Southern Conference center three times in college and was a third-string All-American in 1948, his senior year. Thompson joined the Browns in 1949 and played primarily as a linebacker as the team won the AAFC championship. The Browns joined the NFL in 1950 and won the league championship that year. Thompson was a leader for Cleveland, serving as its captain in 1952 and 1953, his final two seasons. He was named a first-team All-Pro in 1953. After retiring, Thompson worked as a financial executive and was a trustee at William & Mary. He was inducted into his college's athletics hall of fame in 1969 and into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. He died of cancer in 1990. Early life and college Thompson grew up in Woodbridge Township, New Jersey and attended Woodbridge High School. He played football there and was named an all-state athlete under head coach Nick Priscoe. After graduating, Thompson attended the College of William & Mary in Virginia, where he continued to play football as a center. He also played linebacker on defense for the William & Mary Indians, often staying on the field for the entire duration of games. Thompson played for William & Mary in 1944 and between 1946 and 1948 ‚Äì his career was interrupted by a brief stint in the U.S. Army during World War II. He was a leader on the team and an anchor of its line. William & Mary finished with an 8‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record in 1946, and Thompson was named an all-Virginia center. The team improved to 9‚Äì2 the following year under head coach Rube McCray and won the Southern Conference, but lost to Arkansas in the Dixie Bowl. Thompson was again named an all-Virginia player and was named to an all-Southern Conference team. The Associated Press also named him an honorable mention All-American. In 1948, William & Mary posted a 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss‚Äìtie record and beat Oklahoma State in the Delta Bowl. Thompson was an all-state player for the third time in a row and an all-Southern Conference player for the second year running. The Associated Press named him a third-string All-American, and he was selected to play in the annual College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the champion of the professional National Football League (NFL) and a selection of the best college players in the country. Professional career Thompson was drafted in 1948 by the Washington Redskins of the NFL, but he instead signed with the Cleveland Browns of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), a team coached by Paul Brown. Led by a sturdy defense and an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and end Dante Lavelli, the Browns finished with a 9‚Äì1‚Äì2 record in 1949 and won the AAFC championship. Thompson spent some time at center during his rookie year, but was mostly a middle linebacker in the Browns' 5-3 defense in his first three seasons. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950, and advanced to the championship game but lost each year between 1951 and 1953, Thompson's last season. During his last two years, he was the right- side linebacker after Cleveland switched to a 5-2 defense. He was named a second-team All-Pro in 1951 and 1952 and a first-team All-Pro in 1953. Thompson, who was known as a sure tackler and a tenacious leader on defense, was the Browns' team captain in his final two seasons. Later life and death Thompson started a career in the financial industry after retiring from football. He was inducted into the William & Mary Athletics Hall of Fame in 1969 and the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. Thompson, who served on William & Mary's board of trustees, was appointed a senior vice president at the brokerage Shearson Lehman Hutton in early 1990, heading the company's Baltimore office. He died of cancer in later that year. Thompson and his wife, Elizabeth, had four children.

History  In 1943, the village, known as Madagiz was given the status of an urban-type settlement within the Mardakert District of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast. In 1949, the village was home to an industrial complex, including a furniture factory and a lime production workshop. In 1953, a secondary school was opened. The Madagiz hydroelectric power station was built nearby on the banks of the Tartar River. In 1970, 271 people (236 Armenians, 30 Azerbaijanis, 44 Russians and nine Ukrainians) lived in the village. In the early 1990s, Madagiz found itself within the territory of the self-proclaimed Republic of Artsakh, and consequently was affected by hostilities between the Armed Forces of Armenia and the Azerbaijani Armed Forces. During the summer offensive of 1992, Azerbaijani troops established control over the Mardakert District, but as a result of the counter-offensive by the end of June 1993, Armenian troops managed to occupy almost the entire district. In April 2016, during the Four-Day War, the village found itself in the area of direct hostilities. On April 4, Armenian journalists published video and photo reports from Madagiz. On April 5, the Ministry of Defense of Azerbaijan reported that on April 4, the headquarters of the Artsakh military base in Madagiz had been hit.

In the twentieth century the building, which had fallen into disrepair, was restored and in 1991 converted into the Museo Gustavo de Maeztu (), housing the work of the painter Gustavo de Maeztu y Whitney and open to the public. The building is important in the history of architecture in Navarre, since it is the only civil building extant from the Romanesque period. In 1931, it was declared a national monument by the Spanish government. Description Moralizing capital showing Roland against the giant Ferragut by master Martin of Logro√±o It is a Romanesque building built in the second half of 12th century, located in the Plaza de San Mart√≠n and on the corner of Calle de San Nicol√°s, an ancient entrance for pilgrims. The most significant element is the main facade, located opposite the stairway of San Pedro de la R√∫a. It consists of two floors built in ashlar masonry, which are divided in height by a simple molded cornice. The lower body is a gallery of four arches framed by columns attached to the wall, decorated with capitals of vegetable and figurative type. On the left side there are figures of stylized forms that narrate an episode of the Legend of Roland, specifically the scene of Roldan's fight against the giant Ferragut, trying to exemplify the struggle of good against evil. It is signed by Martinus of Logro√±o. On the right side, the decoration is formed by thin leaves of penca, Cistercian rooted. The second floor has four large windows, each divided into its internal space by four slightly pointed arches that rest on fine encapsulated columns adorned with plant, animal and figurative decoration. Above them, a cornice with sculpted corbels. Here the original forms alternate with recent reconstructions, given that over time the structure was modified to adapt to the needs and diverse functions that it has had as a palace and as a prison for the judicial district. It is closed on its sides by two semi-columns, with a decorative scheme on its different capitals. On the left is a capital with plant decoration, while on the right side you can see a set where scenes have been conceived related to the sin of pride, the punishment of hell and lust. The third floor, work of the 18th century, is built in brick. Since June 14, 1991, it has housed the painter's museum Gustavo de Maeztu. The rooms of the museum are distributed in the last two floors of the building and house paintings, drawings, lithographs and other pieces by this painter, one of the most important of the so-called \\"Basque School\\".

Roy McMakin (born 1956 Lander, Wyoming) is a San Diego-based artist, designer, furniture maker, and architect. Biography He began his studies at the Museum Art School in Portland, but soon transferred to the University of California, San Diego, where he completed a BA in 1979 and an MA in 1982. At UCSD, he studied conceptual art making, under the likes of Allan Kaprow, Manny Farber, Jean-Pierre Gorin, and Patricia Patterson. In 1987, he opened his first showroom on Los Angeles' Beverly Boulevard, called Domestic Furniture Co. Though the showroom closed in 1995, it remains online today and has resumed production with Big Leaf Manufacturing. Additionally, his work has been featured in solo-exhibitions at galleries and museums, he has designed entire houses, and increased the production of his furniture for his showroom. His most recent retrospective was a 20-year survey of the sculptor and furniture designer's oeuvre at the University of Washington's Henry Art Gallery in 2005. Influences McMakin's furniture hints at influences from particular architects, designers, artists, and larger trends in American furniture design. His designs echo the Arts and Crafts tradition, Shaker designs, Art Deco and '50s Functional styles, and even mass-produced American commercial furniture. He also admired architect Irving Gill, a pioneer of early 20th century pre-modern design, the sensitive wood worker, George Nakashima, and artist Scott Burton. In fact, he lived in the 1917 Hancock Park house designed by Irving Gill. Of Gill's house, McMakin said \\"It seems to be charged with the element of time, that domesticates whatever was off or unusual about the work when it first appeared. [‚Ä¶] Small, simple houses need to come back in. We need to be more sparing in the way we spend our natural resources. We need to be caring about the natural limits of our environment.\\" His professor, Allan Kaprow, taught him the basics of conceptual art making and provided him with an artistic community in which to experiment. Some critics have likened his taste for minimalism to the great minimalist artists, such as Sol Lewitt and Donald Judd. While other historians have placed him in an artistic lineage that includes West Coast natives John McLaughlin, Robert Irwin, and Charles Ray.

The towns are ≈†id (pronounced [ ÉiÀêd]), Novi Sad and Belgrade. The romanization of Serbian or latinization of Serbian is the representation of Serbian language using Latin letters. Serbian is written in two alphabets, the Serbian Cyrillic, a variation of Cyrillic alphabet, and Gaj's Latin, a variation of the Latin alphabet. Serbian language is an example of digraphia. thumb250pxMain alphabets used in Europe around 1900: Gaj's Latin alphabet is widely used in Serbia. The two are almost directly and completely interchangeable. Romanization can be done with no errors, but in some cases knowledge of Serbian is required to do proper transliteration from Latin back to Cyrillic. Standard Serbian uses both alphabets currently. A survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one; the remaining 17% preferred neither.http://www.b92.net/kultura/vesti.php?nav_category=1087&yyyy;=2014&mm;=12‚ÖÜ=16&nav;_id=936784 Apart from Serbian, Gaj's Latin alphabet is also used in Bosnian and Croatian standards of Serbo-Croatian. Another standard of Serbo-Croatian, Montenegrin, uses a slightly modified version of it. Use of romanization ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá added ƒê instead of Dj in Croatian Academy 1882. Serbo-Croatian was regarded as a single language since the 1850 Vienna Literary Agreement, to be written in two forms: one (Serb) in the adapted Serbian Cyrillic alphabet; the other (Croat) in the adapted Croatian Latin alphabet,The World and Its Peoples 2009 - Page 1654 \\"Until modern times, Serbo-Croat was regarded as a single language, written in two forms: one (Serb) in the Cyrillic alphabet; the other (Croat) in ... that is to say Gaj's Latin alphabet. The Latin alphabet, latinica, was not initially taught in schools in Serbia when it became independent in the 19th century. After a series of efforts by Serbian writers Ljubomir Stojanoviƒá and Jovan Skerliƒá, it became part of the school curriculum after 1914. During World War I, Austria-Hungary banned the Cyrillic alphabet in Bosnia and its use in occupied Serbia was banned in schools. Cyrillic was banned in the Independent State of Croatia in World War II. The government of socialist Yugoslavia made some initial effort to promote romanization, use of the Latin alphabet even in the Orthodox Serbian and Montenegrin parts of Yugoslavia, but met with resistance.The Social construction of written communication Bennett A.

Later still, in 1993 the authorities of Republika Srpska under Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and Momƒçilo Kraji≈°nik decided to proclaim Ekavian and Serbian Cyrillic to be official in Republika Srpska, which was considered grotesque both by native Bosnian Serb writers at the time and the general public, and that decision was rescinded in 1994. Nevertheless, it was reinstated in a milder form in 1996, and today still the use of Serbian Latin is officially discouraged in Republika Srpska, in favor of Cyrillic. Article 10 of the Constitution of Serbia adopted by a referendum in 2006 defined Cyrillic as the official script in Serbia, while Latin was given the status of \\"Script in official use\\". Today Serbian is more likely to be romanized in Montenegro than in Serbia.One thousand languages: living, endangered, and lost - Page 46 Peter Austin - 2008 \\"Croatian and Bosnian are written in the Latin alphabet; Serbian in both Serbia and Bosnia is written in the Cyrillic alphabet. Both scripts are used for Serbian in Montenegro.\\" Exceptions to this include Serbian websites where use of Latin alphabet is often more convenient, and increasing use in tabloid and popular media such as Blic, Danas and Svet.http://www.svet.rs/ More established media, such as the formerly state-run Politika, and Radio Television of Serbia,http://www.tanjug.rs/index1.aspx or foreign Google News,https://news.google.com/ Voice of Russiahttp://serbian.ruvr.ru/ and Facebook tend to use Cyrillic script.Hitting the headlines in Europe: a country-by-country guide Page 166 Cathie Burton, Alun Drake - 2004 \\"The former state-run paper, Politika, which kept its retro style until very recently, using Serbian Cyrillic rather than the Latin alphabet, has been bought by a German company and is modernizing rapidly. There are a host of tabloids, ..\\" Some websites offer the content in both scripts, using Cyrillic as the source and auto generating Romanized version. In 2013 in Croatia there were massive protests against official Cyrillic signs on local government buildings in Vukovar.Agence France-Presse, April 7, 2013 Croatians protest against Cyrillic signs in Vukovar Romanization of names Serbian place names Serbian place names are consistently spelled in latinica using the mapping that exists between the Serbian Cyrillic alphabet and Gaj's Latin alphabet. Serbian personal names Serbian personal names are usually romanized exactly the same way as place names. This is particularly the case with consonants which are common to other Slavic Latin alphabets - ƒå, ƒÜ, ≈†, ≈Ω, D≈æ and ƒê. A problem is presented by the letter ƒê/ƒë that represents the affricate (similar to the \\"dj\\" sound in \\"jam\\"), which is still sometimes represented by \\"Dj\\". The letter ƒê was not part of the original Gaj's alphabet, but was added by ƒêuro Daniƒçiƒá in the 19th century. A transcribed \\"Dj\\" is still sometimes encountered in rendering Serbian names into English (e.g. Novak Djokovic), though strictly ƒê should be used (as in Croatian). Foreign names In Serbian, foreign names are phonetically transliterated into both Latin and Cyrillic, a change that does not happen in Croatian and Bosnian (also Latin). For example, in Serbian history books George Washington becomes or , Winston Churchill becomes or and Charles de Gaulle or .Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, a grammar: with sociolinguistic commentary - Page 3 Ronelle Alexander - 2006 -\\"... name in original Serbian (Cyrillic) Serbian (Latin) Croatian George –è–æ—Ä—ü D≈æord≈æ ; George Mary –ú–µ—Ä–∏ Meri Mary ; Winston Churchill –í–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–æ–Ω –ß–µ—Ä—á–∏–ª Vinston ƒåerƒçil Winston Churchill ; Charles de Gaulle –®–∞—Ä–ª –¥–µ –ì–æ–ª ≈†arl de Gol Charles de Gaulle ;\\" This change also happens in some European languages that use the Latin alphabet such as Latvian. The name Catherine Ashton for instance gets transliterated into or in Serbian. An exception to this are place names which are so well known as to have their own form (exonym): just as English has Vienna, Austria (and not German Wien, √ñsterreich) so Croatian and romanization of Serbian have (). Incomplete romanization Incomplete romanization of Serbian is written using the English alphabet, also known as ASCII Serbian, by dropping diacritics. It is commonly used in SMS messages, comments on the Internet or e-mails, mainly because users do not have a Serbian keyboard installed. Serbian is a fully phonetic language with 30 sounds that can be represented with 30 Cyrillic letters, or 27 Gaj's Latin letters and three digraphs (\\"nj\\" for \\"—ö\\", ‚Äùlj\\" for \\"—ô\\", and \\"d≈æ\\" for \\"—ü\\"). In its ASCII form, the number of used letters drops down to 22, as the letters \\"q\\", \\"w\\", \\"x\\" and \\"y\\" are not used. Some words morph into the same written form and a good knowledge of Serbian and a sentence context is required for proper understanding of the written text. Using incomplete romanization does not allow for easy transliteration back to Cyrillic without significant manual work. Google tried using a machine learning approach to solving this problem and developed an interactive text input tool that enables typing Serbian in ASCII and auto-converting to Cyrillic.Google input tools for Serbian However, manual typing is still required with occasional disambiguation selection from the pop-up menu. Tools for romanization Serbian text can be converted from Cyrillic to Latin and vice versa automatically by computer. There are add-in tools available for Microsoft WordOffice 2003 Add-in: Latin and Cyrillic Transliteration and OpenOffice.org,OOoTranslit add-on for OpenOffice as well as command line tools for Linux, MacOS and Windows.

The British forces, led by General George Harris and Colonel Arthur Wellesley, drove the Mysorean force of Tipu Sultan from a defensive position designed to impede the British force's progress toward Mysore's capital, Seringapatam. Prelude Although the reduction of the power and resources of Tipu Sultan, effected by the Treaty of Seringapatam, which terminated the Third Anglo-Mysore War of 1792, had weakened his influence, yet he remained a perceived threat to the British East India Company. The Sultan had entered into a negotiation with the Governor of the Isle of France (Mauritius), in 1798, and sent an embassy to Zaman Shah, ruler of Kabul, for the purpose of inducing him to attack the possessions of the East India Company. Having also derived encouragement from the successes of Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, from which France intended to act against the British dominions in India, Tipu commenced augmenting his military force, and his hostile designs against the British became every day more apparent. Governor-General Richard, Earl of Mornington (afterwards Marquess of Wellesley) perceiving a rupture inevitable, resolved to launch a preemptive strike, and ordered the army to take the field and march into the heart of the Tipu's Mysore territory. Major-General George (afterwards Lord) Harris, who was serving with the local rank of lieutenant-general, in conformity to these orders, advanced the army under his command on 11 February 1799 and entered Mysore territory on 5 March. Battle On 27 March 1799, British troops arrived at Mallavelly, and on approaching the ground of encampment the forces of Tipu were seen drawn up on a height a few miles off. The enemy attacked the advanced pickets, and a general action ensued, in which the 33rd Regiment of Foot highly distinguished itself. A body of two thousand men moved forward in the best order towards the regiment, which held its fire until the enemy came within about . Then, led by its lieutenant-colonel, Arthur Wellesley (the future Duke of Wellington and the brother of the Governor-General), it made a bayonet charge, forcing the approaching column to give way. This movement being supported by Major-General Floyd, who made a rapid charge with the cavalry, completed the disorder, and the enemy retreated before the whole of the British line, which immediately moved forward. While this attack was being made by the left wing, under Lieutenant-Colonel Wellesley, with the Nizam's contingent, the 33rd, and Major-General Floyd's cavalry, Lieutenant-General Harris and the right wing had also been engaged. As the 12th Foot moved forward on the right wing, a large body of Mysorean cavalry formed a wedge, with an elephant with a howdah on its back in front, and charged the regiment. The British line halted to receive the attack. Immediately afterwards, two other very large bodies of the enemy were spotted in two topes or woods, preparing to support the first charge. Lieutenant-General Harris, recognising the danger, placed himself in the regiment's rear, frequently repeating the words, \\"Steady, Twelfth!\\" \\"Steady, old Twelfth!\\" When the wedge approached within a hundred yards, the Mysoreans discharged their carbines and pistols, but without much effect. When the Mysoreans came within about , the regiment fired a well-directed volley with its muskets, followed by a rapid firing by file, inflicting many casualties to the enemy, creating a rampart of killed and wounded men and horses lying along the front of the regiment. The rear of the wedge was hindered by the killed and wounded in front, and could not continue the charge. The elephant was severely wounded, its handler was dead, and the chiefs on his back had fallen. Turning around, the beast directed all its fury upon the Mysoreans, overturning everything in its path and creating great havoc with a prodigious chain, which he swayed. A few Mysorean horsemen broke through the regiment, but were instantly shot in its rear. The British artillery arrived and opened fire. The enemy cavalry fell back; at the same time, the line advanced, and decided the fate of the day on that part of the battlefield; a distant cannonade, however, indicated that the fighting was raging elsewhere. Aftermath The following morning the British army advanced and arrived before Seringapatam on 5 April 1799, and proceed to lay siege to the city.

Travail et travailleurs en Europe au Moyen √Çge et au d√©but des temps. Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies. p. 307. The Gran Tavola was founded by Orlando Bonsignori in 1255 and in the 1260s became the exclusive depository-general of the incomes of the Papal States. Pope Innocent IV's (1243-1254) conflicts with Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor had demonstrated plainly to the Roman Curia the importance of reliable and robust financial services relationships. The first so-designated papal depository was the Piccolomini firm headed by Angeliero Solafico circa 1233 under Pope Gregory IX; the Gran Tavola filled this role between 1250 and 1270.Hayden B. J. Maginnis, Gabriele Erasmi. 2003. The World of the Early Sienese Painter. Penn State Press. . p. 19. The slightly larger Ricciardi bank of Lucca was also intimately involved in church finances.Dotson, John E. 2004. \\"Banks and Banking\\" in Medieval Italy. Routledge. . p. 92. During the reign of Pope Clement IV, the bank became responsible for the collection of all the ecclesiastical tithes for the Holy Land. Under Pope Urban IV (1265‚Äì68), all pontifical taxes were collected by the Gran Tavola. After the 1260s, popes Nicholas III, Honorius IV, and Nicholas IV continued to use Sienese banks for a small amount of transactions. The bank also supported Charles of Anjou in his conquest of the Kingdom of Sicily; through a network of \\"virtual banking syndicates\\" the bank secured a loan of 200,000 livres tournois for the Angevin monarch.Richard Bonney. 1995. Economic Systems and State Finance. Oxford University Press. . p. 510. The Gran Tavola benefited greatly from Charles's victory over the House of Hohenstaufen, having previously seen its commercial opportunities limited by Siena's political support of the Hohenstaufen. The Gran Tavola was \\"at the center of financial operations in both Genoa and Tuscany\\"; Guglielmo Leccacorvo served as the bank's representative in Genoa.Lane, Frederic C. 1957. [Review]. The Journal of Economic History 17(1): 130.

The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Medieval Civilization. Mayflower Books. p. 151. Decline and failure 12th century Sienese coins The bank declined after the death of Bonsignori in 1273, and went bankrupt in 1298. The formality of bankruptcy may not have occurred until several years after 1298. The coup de gr√¢ce for the Gran Tavola was the crunch caused by the confiscation of Sienese assets by Philip IV of France (as a result of debts he claimed to have been owed by the Bonsignori) and the loss of papal business under Pope Boniface VIII (a trend under way since the early 1290s). The failure of the Gran Tavola was followed by a period of acute and sustained economic ruin in Siena,Thompson, James Westfall. 1931. Economic and Social History of Europe in the Later Middle Ages (1300-1530). The Century Co. p. 14. systemically spreading to several other Sienese banks. By 1320, Siena's international position had contracted almost entirely, following the additional failure of the Tolomei bank in 1313 and the decline of the Champagne fairs, whose commercial activities were \\"umbilically linked\\" to Siena; for example, Sienese institutions were not present in the Avignon Exchange created during the Avignon Papacy.Trevor Dean, Philip James Jones, Chris Wickham. 1990. City and Countryside in Late Medieval and Renaissance Italy. Continuum International Publishing Group. . p. 83. Pope Nicholas IV lost 80,000 florins as a result of the collapse of the Gran Tavola but the loss was mitigated by the overall weakening of Siena, at the time known for its anti-papal, though nominally Ghibelline, allegiances.Thompson, James Westfall. 1928. Economic and Social History of the Middle Ages. The Century Co. p. 471. Many years later, this loss served as one of the pretexts for the papal interdict of Siena.William M. Bowsky. 1970.

Some medical experts use the term actinic prurigo to denote a rare photodermatosis that develops in childhood and is chronic and persistent; this rare photodermatosis, associated with the human leukocyte antigen HLA-DR4, is often called \\"Familial polymorphous light eruption of American Indians\\" or \\"Hereditary polymorphous light eruption of American Indians\\" but some experts consider it to be a variant of the syndrome known as polymorphous light eruption (PMLE). Some experts use the term actinic prurigo for Hutchinson's summer prurigo (aka hydroa aestivale) and several other photodermatoses that might, or might not, be distinct clinical entities. Symptoms AP is characterized by itchy, inflamed papules, nodules, and plaques on the skin. Lesions typically appear hours or days after exposure of the skin to UV light, and follow a general pattern of sun-exposed areas. The face, neck, arms, hands, and legs are often affected, although lesions sometimes appear on skin that is covered by clothing and thus not exposed to UV light, thus making AP somewhat difficult to diagnose. AP is a chronic disease, and symptoms usually worsen in the spring and summer as the day lengthens and exposure to sunlight increases. Causes The cause for actinic prurigo is unknown, however researchers believe that protein in our bodies may be a cause to the condition also: ‚Ä¢UV-A and UV-B light seem to be the main provoking agents. This observation is supported by the fact that most patients live at high altitudes (>1000 m above sea level), and the condition improves in many patients when they move to lower altitudes. However, some patients who are affected already live at sea level.18,19,27 ‚Ä¢Some authors are considering a food photosensitizer or a nutritional selective deficiency as a cause; however, no evidence proves this theory.27 Diagnosis Treatment Currently there is no cure for actinic prurigo, and treatment focuses on relieving the dermatologic symptoms, by way of topical steroid creams or systemic immunosuppressants. Prescribed treatments include: * topical creams such as Tacrolimus and Betamethasone. * systemic immunosuppressants such as Prednisone. * In some cases, Thalidomide has proven to be effective in controlling the symptoms of actinic prurigo. All patients with AP are encouraged to minimize sun exposure, and to use strong sunscreen throughout the year, and even on cloudy or overcast days, as UVA light, unlike UVB light, is able to penetrate cloud cover and remains constant throughout the day. Alternative treatment methods might include UV Hardening, Meditation and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. UV-A desensitization phototherapy has also been shown to be effective in cases.

An important rail link between the Southeast and Southwest U.S., it is owned by the Meridian Speedway LLC (MSLLC), a joint venture of Kansas City Southern (KCS), the majority partner; and Alabama Great Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). History The Speedway was originally two railroads: the Alabama and Vicksburg Railway built the section from Meridian to Vicksburg, while the Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railway built the section from Vicksburg to Shreveport. Together they were known as the \\"Vicksburg Route.\\" These railroads, as well as others forming a line from New Orleans, Louisiana, through Meridian to Cincinnati, Ohio, were joined in 1881 to form the Queen and Crescent Route, controlled by the Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railways Company, Limited. In 1926, the Vicksburg Route was leased by the Illinois Central Railroad, which was renamed Illinois Central Gulf in 1972. In 1986, ICG divested itself of the line when it spun off MidSouth Rail Corporation. In 1993, KCS acquired the line as part of its purchase of MidSouth. On December 2, 2005, KCS and NS announced their agreement to form a joint venture. KCS contributed the rail line, NS $300 million in cash, almost all of which was slated for capital improvements to increase capacity and improve transit times. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) completed its regulatory review on April 10, 2006; KCS and NS closed the deal on May 1. By September 2007, about $135 million had been spent on the improvements. Several new and longer passing sidings were installed along with a new CTC signaling system. The mainline was effectively rebuilt from the ground up with new ballast, crossties and heavier welded rail. Soon after this first round of improvements, about 45 trains per day traversed the line, Current operations Today, the line sees fewer than 15 trains per day, mostly run- through Kansas City Southern intermodal trains.

He is best known for his book on the Iraq War, Generation Kill (2004). He also wrote an expos√© about a top CIA officer who allegedly worked as a Mafia hitman, How to Get Away With Murder in America (2012). Although some compare his writings to those of Hunter S. Thompson, Wright claims his biggest literary influences were Mark Twain and British-American author Christopher Isherwood. The New York Times called his military writing \\"nuanced and grounded in details often overlooked in daily journalistic accounts\\" and noted his use of \\"gallows humor\\". Biography Wright was born in Cleveland, Ohio and grew up in Willoughby, Ohio. Both of his parents were lawyers. His father was a prosecutor, then the general counsel, for a utility. Wright attended Hawken School, but was kicked out for selling marijuana and sent to a home for juvenile delinquents called The Seed. He returned to Hawken and made State Debate finals in high school. Wright studied at Johns Hopkins University and at Vassar College; he graduated from Vassar with a degree in medieval history. His first writing job was to interview South African political leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, but it was for a small magazine that did not pay. Hustler magazine In 1995, he became the entertainment editor and chief pornographic film reviewer for Hustler magazine. In 2000, he wrote about the experience and the issues surrounding the pornography industry in an article for Salon, titled \\"Maxed Out\\", and for the LA Weekly, in a cover story titled \\"Scenes from My Life in Porn\\". Immersion journalism Starting in 1996 at Hustler, then at Rolling Stone, TIME, and Vanity Fair, he wrote long features based on his immersion in subcultures ranging from radical environmentalists to neo-Nazis. Many of his essays focused on crimes or controversial figures, and were said by him to capture a \\"dark, untamed America\\" that resembled \\"the Wild West.\\" Several of his essays were collected in the book Hella Nation, which Wright called a \\"sort of autobiography\\". His essays in Hella Nation were compared to Joan Didion's writings on California. Another reviewer called Hella Nation a \\"comically macabre portrait of American life\\". Military reporting In 2002, Wright went to Afghanistan on assignment for Rolling Stone. In 2003, he was embedded with the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion of the United States Marine Corps during the early stages of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Wright spent his entire time embedded in a recon team led by then Sergeant Brad Colbert. He was under fire with the Marines for several weeks, and accompanied them \\"on point\\" (i.e., in the lead vehicle). One of the Marines in the unit told The New York Times, \\"He was in the worst possible place to have a reporter. During the first firefight, he took 10 rounds in his door.\\" Wright expressed admiration for the Marines, but warned them that a reporter's motto is \\"charm and betray\\". He published a series of articles for Rolling Stone magazine titled \\"The Killer Elite\\" which, in 2004, received the National Magazine Award for Reporting, the top prize in magazine writing. He then wrote Generation Kill. In 2007, he returned to Iraq when the surge in U.S. forces was beginning. Wright interviewed General David Petraeus and spent several weeks embedded with U.S. troops in Baghdad, Ramadi, and Diwania. He later criticized American television media for promoting misperceptions of the war. He also criticized some U.S. political leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, for calling the surge a failure before it had been fully implemented.http://bigthink.com/ideas/284 Television and film HBO adapted Generation Kill into an eponymous television miniseries first aired in 2008; Wright is portrayed by Lee Tergesen. Wright himself served as a writer and consulting producer on the project, collaborating closely with Emmy-winning producer David Simon. Wright was hired by Paramount to write a script about Miami's \\"Cocaine Cowboys\\" Jon Roberts and Mickey Munday for Peter Berg to direct. The screenplay is based on a book Wright wrote about Roberts, published by Crown Books. Actor Mark Wahlberg is producing the film and plans to star in it. In 2010, it was announced that director Ole Bornedal was filming a movie inspired by an article Wright wrote for TIME magazine called \\"Death of a Hostess\\". Wright's article was a profile of Japanese serial-rapist and killer Joji Obara he wrote in Tokyo for TIME magazine. In 2012, he released the book American Desperado, co-wrotten with Jon Roberts, who was featured in the documentary Cocaine Cowboys. Controversies At least six of the Marines Wright wrote about in Generation Kill have claimed they were punished for the remarks he published. Spokesman Lt. Nathan Braden denied that any Marines were punished as a result of Wright's work. In 2004, Wright wrote an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the U.S. military for allowing Iraq's insurgents to obtain weapons. Wright has criticized college creative writing programs, saying such programs produce bad writers.

Rondinone is widely known for his temporary, large-scale land art sculpture, Seven Magic Mountains (2016‚Äì2021), with its seven fluorescently- painted totems of large, car-size stones stacked high.Graham Bowley (April 9, 2015), Splash of color in the desert New York Times The installation's organizers, Art Production Fund (APF) and the Nevada Museum of Art, estimated that 16 million people would see the work‚Äîfrom its location just south of Las Vegas, alongside Interstate 15, the primary Los Angeles ‚Äì Las Vegas interstate.

Seven Magic Mountains (2016‚Äì21) Seven Magic Mountains, commissioned, produced and financed by the Art Production Fund (APF) and the Nevada Museum of Art, followed Rondinone's work Human Nature, a Public Art Fund project of monumental, stone stick-figures arranged in the highly man-made environment of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan‚Äîand depicts the opposite: highly artificial neon totems set in the natural environment. The piece consists of 33 limestone boulders, each weighing 10 to 25 tons, arranged in seven towers 30 to 35 feet tall‚Äîsecured by a solid backbone, with each stone painted a bright, fluorescent color. Approximately five years in the making, the work is located on the far southern end of Las Vegas Boulevard, 10 miles south of the intersection of Las Vegas Boulevard and St. Rose Parkway in Henderson, Nevada, near Dry Jean Lake, with a backdrop of the McCullough Mountains. It is located at . The sculpture was organized by the Nevada Museum of Art and runs from May 11, 2016 to December 31, 2018‚Äîhaving originally been scheduled for two years and extended through the end of 2018. Near the end of 2018, the sculpture was again rescheduled to extend three more years. The original installation opened following a two-day inaugural event. The work is situated on three acres (1.2 ha) of federally owned land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management. Resolving federal, state, and local regulations consumed nearly 20% of the project‚Äôs budget and permitting took approximately three years. Ultimately, the Bureau of Land Management granted a ‚Äúsite‚Äù type right-of-way permit‚Äîtypically a 30-year permit authorizing projects such as communication towers‚Äîfor three years. Seven Magic Mountains was privately funded and cost approximately $3.5 million.

Dominating the frame and the spectator, Zhang's little subjects offer oddly sinister and uncomprehending expressions.

He was promoted to Captain in 1882, Rear-Admiral in 1897, and Admiral in 1907. He saw active service during the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, and from 1883 to 1887 he was a Naval Attach√©. In 1887 he was appointed to command the new cruiser HMS Calliope in the Pacific, and after service in China and Australia was sent to Samoa to watch over a growing international crisis there. This posting is generally remembered for a remarkable act of seamanship; when Calliope was in harbour, the island was struck by a powerful cyclone. Of the eleven ships present, only Calliope was able to successfully escape the harbour and ride out the cyclone at sea; the others were beached or wrecked, with over two hundred lives lost. He was later made CB in the Queen's Birthday Honours for 1891, and given command of that year. In 1894, he was appointed as the Director of Naval Ordnance, holding the office until 1897.

Baudry (sic) was described in Scientific AmericanScientific American, April 28, 1866, p. 284 as having made a Flint Piano. As silex is the French word for flint, this would appear to be either the same instrument or a precursor of it. The article was taken from The Mechanics' Magazine at an unspecified earlier date. > A curious novelty has just been brought to London and is about to be > exhibited to the public.

Two other tones were, after an > almost endless investigation of flints, obtained from pieces of schist, the > only exception to the flint tones which form the instrument. M.

It was known as \\"Lee's Foreign Legion\\" due to the large numbers of foreign-born troops. Unit composition 10th Infantry Regiment was assembled at Camp Moore, Louisiana, during June and July 1861, and soon moved to Virginia. Its members were from Orleans and Bossier and St. Landry parishes many were farmers, sailors, and laborers. Wearing zouave uniforms, the regiment was composed of many foreigners as well as Southerners from other states; but overall probably about one-third of the unit was Irish only about three companies of the unit were of native Southern descent. In April 1862, it totaled 595 men and during the war served in McLaws', Semmes', Starke's, Nicholls', Iverson's, Stafford's, and York's Brigades.  Engagements The 10th Louisiana fought in many engagements of the Army of the Northern Virginia from the Battle of Williamsburg to the Battle of Cold Harbor. At the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, the regiment was part of the brigade of Col. Jesse Williams and participated in a series of unsuccessful attacks on Union entrenchments on Culp's Hill. Later, the 10th was part of the Mine Run and Bristoe campaigns. After participating in the Overland Campaign in early 1864, the 10th then was active in the Shenandoah Valley with General Early.

In the last line of the deed was already written the name of Beremund, first prior of ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse. Pseudoetymology The ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse in 1730 The following legend is a pseudoetymology of the monastery name. When the Margrave of Styria Ottokar III returned from the Second Crusade, he wished for some relaxation and therefore visited Leopold from Gonobitz to go hunting on Mount Konjice (). Coincidentally he came to a shady hollow in the south part of the mountain, where suddenly an extremely white hind appeared in front of him. He followed it as bewitched on his horse, but because he was not able to catch it he fell asleep in the shade on the hot summer afternoon (on St. John the Baptist's day). A man in a white fur coat appeared in his dream and revealed himself as St. John the Baptist, ordering him to build a monastery on this place. At that moment a rabbit jumped into Ottokar's lap because it was frightened by the hunter's screaming. The saint's image disappeared and Ottokar shouted: \\"A rabbit, look, a rabbit!\\" Because of this rabbit the monastery was called \\"Seiz Charterhouse\\" (the Slovenian pronunciation of rabbit, zajec, is written Seiz in German) for a long time and has the initial \\"S\\" in its coat of arms. Name Over the centuries, the name ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse appears in early written documents in various forms: Seitz (1185), Sitze (1186, 1243), Seiz (1202, 1234), Sishe (1229), Seitis (1233), Sits (1235, 1257), Siz (1237), Syces (1240), Sic (1243), Syces (1245), Siths (1247), Seits (1257)  Architecture of ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse  Book of Prayers, ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse, 1423 Lay monk Aynard, construction master sent from Grande Chartreuse, influenced much to the arrangement of the premises. The first emergency Charterhouse buildings were build until at least 1165. The scheme or Chartusian monasteries usually comprised three basic elements: monastic church, a small cross corridor (Lesser Cloister) and a great cross corridor. As with first French charterhouses, two monasteries were built here. Upper one (Domus Superior), where the cloister monks used to live according to the strict rule of the Carthusians, they spend time in contemplative prayer and individual work in their cells. Great Cloister linked monastic cells and there was a God's Acre also, where monks were buried. In ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse there was a crucifix, placed in the middle at first. In 15th Century the crucifix was removed and replaced by cemetery chapel, where priors were buried, which has been preserved until now. Lesser Cloister linked communal rooms and served as an entrance to the St. John the Baptist church and Sacristy. Communal rooms, such as Chapter house, Refectory (common dining room), a kitchen, a Dormitory (a bedroom for lay brothers, who participated at the liturgy on holidays and Sundays) were build around the Lesser Cloister. Lower one (Domus Inferior) in the settlement of ≈†pitaliƒç for the lay monks, who had less prayer and spend time in manual labor in the agriculture, winegrowing, as craftsments at grass making, sawmills, brickwork, supporting the upper monastery and contributing to its prosperity. They were mostly illiterate and listened to Holy Mass under leadership and explanations of a procurator. Despite strict order restrictions which prevented the Chartusians from direct activities among people, they were good example of charity. Lower monastery boasted so called Hospice also, where people in need were given charity, as money, clothes, food and medicine, made also of their own herbs, according to the recipes from carthusian library. All the monastic buildings in ≈†pitaliƒç were demolished after dissolution and only the church remained.  History  The monastery was settled by Carthusian monks and lay monks from the Grande Chartreuse near Grenoble in France, led by prior Beremund, count of Cornwall, royal relative, prior of Durbon Charterhouse in Provence. Roman Pope Urban VI at the time of the Great Schism in the western Roman Catholic Church moved to ≈Ωiƒçe Chaterhouse the seat of the prior general of Chartusian order for almost two decades (1391-1410). Three ≈Ωiƒçe priors, John from Bari (1391), Christopher (1391-1398) and Stephen Maconi from Siena (1398-1410) became prior general of the order, so at that time the ≈Ωiƒçe charterhouse formed a Chartusian order top policy and made all important decisions.  Stephen Maconi  The Carthusian prior general, beatificated Stephen Maconi (prior at ≈Ωiƒçe), a friend of Saint Catherine of Siena and big supporter of her canonization process, worked also lot to reunite his Carthusian order and charterhouses of Europe, divided in support to popes from Rome and others, supporting the antipopes from Avignon.  Philipp von Seitz  About 1300 , also known as Bruder Philipp, der Kart√§user (), reworked the epic poem Vita beate virginis Marie et salvatoris rhythmica (about 1230) Reprints of 2018: , at the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse, thereby creating 10,133 lines in Middle High German. Due to their humbleness, the Carthusians did not sign their work, but the postscript \\"in dem h√ªs ze Seitz\\" () makes it clear that his poem was composed at the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse. The monastery was attacked during an Ottoman raid in 1531. This marked the beginning of a decline in its influence and fortunes. In 1564 it passed into the hands of commendatory priors and in 1591 to the Jesuits of Graz. It was recovered by the Carthusians in 1593, after which it prospered again. The monastic church, dedicated to Saint John the Baptist Former monastic church, now the parish church in ≈†pitaliƒç In 1782 Emperor Joseph II abolished the monastery, one of the earliest to be dissolved under the Josephine Reforms. The charterhouse was allowed to fall into decay. When the charterhouse was dissolved, an inventory was also made of the ≈Ωiƒçe pharmacy, which was equipped with all kinds of medicines and other material.Zdovc, Vinko: ≈Ωiƒçka kartuzija, Kratka zgodovina bogate preteklosti kartuzije 1165-1782. Slovenske Konjice 1997 The ruins of the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse were bought at auction from the religious foundation in 1826 by Prince Weriand of Windisch-Graetz and remained the property of this family until the end of World War II. Today's owner of the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse is the Municipality of Slovenske Konjice.  Monastic churches  The monastic Carthusian church was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist (Ecclesia Maior) and consecrated on 24 October 1190 by Patriarch Godfrey of Hohenstaufen. Also monastic church of Mary's visitation in ≈†pitaliƒç (Ecclesia Minor) was consecrated in 1190. It was built in the French late Romanesque style and has remained almost unchanged until today.

On 30 May 1487, the visiting Bishop of Caorle stayed at the ≈Ωiƒçe charterhouse as an emissary of the Patriarch of Aquileia. His secretary Paolo Santonino wrote in his ItineraryItinerario in Carinzia, Stiria e Carniola (1485-1487), transl. Roberto Gagliardi, published 1999, Biblioteca de L'unicorno. that the monks had more than 2,000 volumes (mostly manuscripts) which was larger than all but the Vatican library. Now only 120 are known, with fragments of a further 100 or so. In the mid-16th century, as the result of a number of tragic events in the preceding half-century, the monastery was nearly abandoned and Archduke Charles II of Styria ordered the books to be moved to the library of the Jesuit College in Graz. ≈Ωiƒçe manuscripts 150px The Carthusian order never preached religion through the spoken word, but took to spreading it in writing, accepting into the order only people with a good knowledge of foreign languages (mostly German, Latin, and Greek) and exemplary writing skills. They devoted a large part of their lives to producing precise copies of existing texts as well as creating new ones on a wide range of topics, from theology to astronomy, from practical sciences to those more literary in nature. Among the texts still in existence are many notable works which are part of the intellectual heritage of this region and the wider Middle-European sphere. Despite the loss of most of the manuscripts, the remnants of impressive library can still provide a valuable insight into several centuries of continuous development of the medieval book. Today about 120 manuscripts and 100 fragments are known. This is only a fraction of the whole, and even this small part is almost entirely outside Slovenian borders. Yet this is the only group of medieval manuscripts from Slovenia, making it possible to follow nearly four centuries of unbroken manuscript production within one monastic community. The manuscripts from the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse include many notable texts written by authors living in ≈Ωiƒçe or the nearby Jurklo≈°ter Charterhouse. Examples include texts by Phillip of ≈Ωiƒçe (Seitz), Nicolaus Kempf, and Sifried of Swabia. Several of these manuscripts are also signed by monks or copyists from outside, who were probably benefactors, and their hand-written works makes of rich palette of paleographical forms. It is also the only group of manuscripts in Slovenia which is complete enough to follow the development of flourished (penwork) initials and consequently to speak about the \\"≈Ωiƒçe style\\". Some manuscripts also display colourful painted initials and other illuminated elements, created by professional and‚Äîas was common practice in those times‚Äîby itinerant painters.  Gastu≈æ Inn  Gastu≈æ Inn Guests or visitors were always taken outside the charterhouse walls. After the dissolution of the monastery in ≈†pitaliƒç, guest were welcomed in the Gastu≈æ Inn, purporting to be the oldest inn on Slovenian territory (dating to 1467). Present day Today the ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse is an important historical and cultural monument with about 20,000 visitors per year. Reconstruction work under expert supervision is still in progress. In accordance with modern processes nowadays ≈Ωiƒçe Chaterhouse hosts many cultural events during summer, even wedding, trying to revitalise historical memory to the chartusians in this area. On the occasion of 850th anniversary of ≈Ωiƒçe Charterhouse foundation deed, Charterhouse was proclaimed a cultural monument of national importance on 24th of June 2018, by the Government of Republic of Slovenia.

After a number of short voyages in the western Pacific Ocean she participated in the Okinawa campaign from 21 May to 30 June. The ship entered Pearl Harbor Navy Yard in December for conversion to an Ordnance Spare Parts Barge, and remained there until March 1946. She steamed to Portland, Oregon, 21 November and decommissioned 19 December 1946. Korean War service  On 27 January 1949 she was reclassified AG-149, and named League Island 1 February. Due to the Korean War buildup, she recommissioned 3 January 1951, Lt. R. E. Duppenthaler in command. She was converted to a cargo stores ship 17 January to 2 March by Bethlehem Pacific Coast Steel Corp., Oakland, California, and upon completion, moved to San Diego, California, 24 March. The ship departed for Japan 1 June to join ServRon 3 with whom she served from Sasebo and Yokosuka from June 1951 to August 1954. She was reclassified AKS-30 on 18 August 1951. During this period she carried out her mission of supplying spare parts to the fleet in the Far East in support of America's Korean commitment.  Post-war service USS League Island (AG-149). With the cessation of hostilities in Korea, the ship sailed to the Philippines to assist the U.S. 7th Fleet in the South China Sea area. She served from Subic Bay, not returning to Japan until May 1955. Early in 1956 she was back in the Philippines to continue logistic support for the 7th Fleet. She returned to Sasebo March 1956, and sailed for San Francisco, California, 30 April. Decommissioning She decommissioned at Astoria, Oregon, 14 December 1956. Stricken from the Navy List 1 April 1960, she was sold 17 March 1961 to Hatch & Kirk Co., Seattle, Washington, and towed away for scrapping on 24 April 1961. However AG149 did not go for scrap and ended up in Singapore in the early 1970s where it was bought by an Arab businessman and renamed Al Rashedia. The ship was modified to off load bagged cement and loaded with bagged cement she sailed for Bahrain in the Persian Gulf at the time of the building boom. On arrival around 1975 the vessel was off loaded and beached on Muhurraq Island part of Bahrain and abandoned. The vessel was moved in the late 70s from Muhurraq and beached on the opposite side of the anchorage on Bahrain Island and left. 149 slowly sank by the bows and remained with the foredeck awash for over two years. In 1980 plans were submitted to the Bahrain Government to redevelop the area where the ship lay into a yacht marina. Approval was granted and the first attempt at salvaging the vessel was undertaken by a local diving company using compressed air. A month later despite extensive diving operations the vessel had not moved. The company went into liquidation and many suppliers of plant and equipment went unpaid. The vessel was then purchased for scrap by a local company and the removal awarded to the Dutch salvage company Smit International, who in turn sub contracted the diving operations to D.M.S. who had a specialist team of salvage divers. Seven days after starting operations the Al Rashedia was towed away and subsequently sold to a company in the United Arab Emirates. It was here at Sharjah in 1981 that the hull was cut down and the vessel turned into a barge. What happened after this date is unclear but the ship most probably ended its days with the ship breakers at Gadani Beach in Pakistan.Gulf Daily News newspaper, Bahrain.

Airing in various timeslots throughout the daytime (and sometimes nighttime) hours and serving as The Weather Channel's de facto flagship forecast program, it features weather forecasts, analysis and weather-related feature segments. This program, the current incarnation of Weather Center (which differs in format from the version that debuted in 1998), debuted on March 2, 2009. Program history 1998‚Äì2006 Weather Center debuted in 1998 (replacing WeatherScope) and was originally formatted as a program devoted to hard weather news. It had three main blocks: Weather Center AM (focusing on business and leisure weather) from 5am to noon, Weather Center (focusing on ongoing conditions) from noon to 7pm, and Weather Center PM (focusing on coming days' forecasts) from 7pm to 5am. In 2000, with the additions of First Outlook and Your Weather Today, the program was reduced to daytime and evening broadcasts. Weather Centers presence on The Weather Channel's schedule decreased even further as additional forecast and long-form programs debuted; by the end of 2008, the program aired for only one hour a day during the week. 2007‚Äì2009 In February 2009, The Weather Channel's media kit began showing a different logo for the program; the most notable change to come from this, however, was the retitling of the program to Weather Center with Abrams & Bettes.http://www.twcmediakit.com/cable/programming/daily_programming/weather_center.html Changes to electronic program guide schedules revealed that Weather Center would absorb the repeating overnight hour on weeknights, and that Weather Center would also be added to evenings (correlating with the merger of Evening Edition and Abrams & Bettes). The expansion of Weather Center reversed a trend of partitioning that took place between 1998 and 2003. The changes themselves were some of the most far-reaching since the 2003 addition of Day Planner, Afternoon Outlook and Weekend Outlook, itself a casualty, being replaced by Weekend View. 2009‚Äì2011 From May 5 to June 12, 2009, Mike Bettes left the studio to report on the Vortex 2 project, a project in which researchers spent five weeks in Tornado Alley (the region comprising the Great Plains and South Central United States that is the most climatalogically favorable for tornado development) tracking tornadoes with weather researchers in an attempt to discover more information about the formation of these storms. Throughout the entire duration of the project, Bettes reported live in the field during Weather Center with Abrams & Bettes each evening, except for instances in which the Vortex 2 project was suspended for the day due to lack of tornadic activity. Several editions of the show featured Bettes and the Vortex 2 crew actively chasing potential tornado-producing supercells; on June 5, 2009, the crew caught its first and only tornado of the year live on PM Edition, the coverage of which spilled over into the beginning of Weather Center; both programs covered the entire tornado event without commercial interruption. While Bettes was reporting with the project crew, TWC on-camera meteorologist Adam Berg substituted for him in the studio. The final edition of Weather Center with Abrams & Bettes aired 1¬Ω weeks earlier on June 12, 2009, allowing Stephanie Abrams and Mike Bettes to take a week off from studio work prior to assuming their new duties as co-anchors of Your Weather Today starting on June 22, 2009. Alexandra Steele and Jim Cantore replaced them as anchors of the 7 p.m. Eastern hour of Weather Center on June 15, 2009 (although television listing services such as Zap2it stated that the changeover would occur one week later on June 22). Kevin Robinson, a former host of Your Weather Today, was added as an additional co-anchor of the program on June 22, 2009. On the same day, meteorologist Nicole Mitchell became Paul Goodloe's permanent co- host on the 10 p.m. Eastern hour of Weather Center. The 7‚Äì10 p.m. ET block at this time was called Weather Center with Cantore and Steele, similar to Your Weather Todays new subtitling as Your Weather Today with Abrams & Bettes. In December 2009, Kevin Robinson left Weather Center with Cantore and Steele to become a meteorologist at Cincinnati NBC affiliate WLWT, and was replaced by Chris Warren. In late September 2010, Crystal Egger joined Weather Center as a full-time co-anchor. Jim Cantore was reassigned to report on breaking weather news from the channel's newsroom. In September 2010, Weather Center co-host Alexandra Steele left the network, and later became an on-camera meteorologist for CNN in early 2011. Nicole Mitchell left the program in November 2010, and was replaced by Kelly Cass. 2011‚Äì2013 On January 31, 2011, TWC unveiled a major shift in its evening programming. It began airing Weather Center in three one-hour blocks each night (at 7 p.m., 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern) surrounding the channel's long-form programming (a term referring to The Weather Channel's original documentary and reality programs). Weather Center was subsequently expanded to weekends on February 5, 2011. Chris Warren and Crystal Egger hosted the weekday editions; Paul Goodloe and Kelly Cass anchored on weekends. In May 2011, Weather Center was officially retitled as Weather Center Live. On November 16 of that year, Weather Center Live debuted the \\"Winter Weather Update\\" segment, as a replacement for the \\"Tropical Update\\" segment usually seen at 50 minutes past each hour from June to November. The segment lasted until March 24, after which the slot is taken over by the \\"Severe Weather Update\\" segment, which airs at 50 minutes past the hour until the start of the Atlantic hurricane season on June 1. An afternoon edition of Weather Center Live began airing at 4 p.m. Eastern starting on March 26, 2012. Six days later on March 31, the weekend edition also expanded to the 4 p.m. slot, effectively canceling PM Edition Weekend. The late afternoon edition of Weather Center Live was shifted to 5‚Äì7 p.m. Eastern on November 12, 2012. 2013‚Äì2018 In July 2013, Todd Santos left the program and The Weather Channel, and was replaced by Keith Carson. Crystal Egger left the channel on September 6, 2013; Egger returned on September 12 to anchor an extended Weather Center Live edition from 1 to 3 a.m. ET due to severe weather, before leaving the network for good. Alexandra Wilson was reassigned from the weekend 4 p.m. edition of Weather Center Live to weeknights as Egger's replacement, being paired with Chris Warren and Jim Cantore during the 7 p.m. Eastern hour of the broadcast. On November 12, 2013, Weather Center Live (presented by Jen Carfagno and Alex Wallace) debuted at 4 a.m. (as part of the show's expansion) and The Weather Channel's extensive rebranding started at this point (which included a revised graphics package, the introduction of a new set for its forecast programs and the permanent expansion of the Lower Display Line throughout national commercial breaks and long-form programming to provide local weather information). This was highlighted again during Morning Rush, which debuted at 7 a.m. the same day. Also, as a result of the changing schedule, First Forecast, On the Radar, Day Planner, Sunrise Weather, Weekend View and Weekend Now were all absorbed into WCL (weekdays 4‚Äì5:30 a.m., 11 a.m.-2 p.m. and 5‚Äì8 p.m.; weekends 4:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Eastern). As a consequence, the nightly 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern, and weekend 4 and 7 p.m. Eastern editions of Weather Center Live were replaced with long-form programming (effectively removing regularly scheduled forecast programs from the channel's nighttime schedule for the first time in its history, and also limiting forecast programming on weekends to morning and early afternoon timeslots). The show's duration can be extended, ultimately canceling longform original programs, and have its logo changed to red throughout major weather events. On February 24, 2014, the 2‚Äì5 p.m. ET block now showed Weather Center Live. This addition occurred almost a month after The Weather Channel was removed from satellite provider DirecTV due to a carriage dispute, citing complaints over the channel's increased reliance on long-form programs over forecast programming; with the change, the channel's schedule consists solely of forecast programming during the daytime hours and long-form programs during nighttime hours on weekdays. When Weather Center Live was expanded, Vivian Brown anchored the show from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET with (Mon-Wed) Nick Walker and (Thu-Fri) Keith Carson. In July, Walker moved to primetime to cover breaking weather news and Carson went on to host WCL's 4‚Äì7 a.m. weekend edition and report for Wake Up With Al Monday through Wednesdays. Jennifer Delgado replaced them as Brown's co-host. In April 2014, Dave Schwartz returned to the Weather Channel for the first time since 2008. He and Alex Wilson would anchor Weather Center Live from 2 to 5 p.m. ET (3 to 7 p.m. ET during severe weather) weekdays for the next two years. On Thursday, November 6, 2014, the weekday 4‚Äì5:30 a.m. ET edition of Weather Center Live was replaced by long-form programming (from 4 to 5 a.m. ET) and an expanded Wake Up With Al (from 5 to 5:30 a.m. ET). On November 8, the weekend 4‚Äì5 a.m. and noon-2 p.m. ET editions of the show were also replaced by long-form programming. As a result of these changes, Weather Center Live aired from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET on weekdays and 5 a.m.-noon ET on weekends. On Monday, November 17, 2014, Weather Center Live added an extra edition on the 10 a.m. hour, replacing the rebroadcast of Wake Up with Al. On February 7, 2015, the weekend 5‚Äì9 a.m. ET edition of the program was replaced by a new AMHQ Weekend, hosted by Reynolds Wolf and Kait Parker. On March 14, 2015, the weekend 9 a.m.-noon ET edition was replaced by a new weekend show called Weekend Recharge, hosted by Maria LaRosa and Paul Goodloe, alongside expert Greg Postel. As a result, Weather Center Live became a weekday-only show, airing from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET. On August 24, the 6-8pm timeslot was replaced by a show called Weather Underground, hosted by Mike Bettes and Alex Wilson. From the week of October 5, 2015, Wake Up with Als timeslot was replaced with Weather Center Live. During severe weather events, The Weather Channel may opt to replace the normal color scheme (blue, white and dark gray) of its graphics to become black-and-red (known as the \\"Storm Alert\\" mode), with the one-third of the \\"R\\"-bar featuring in-depth information of the event instead of the regular \\"rundown\\" list of segments. TWC has not used the Weather Center Live banner during such events since roughly 2015; instead, an alternative name that explicitly states the events (Winter Storm/Severe Storm/Hurricane Central) is used on-air. For rating purposes, WCL continues to be utilised as the umbrella title for TWC's extended broadcasts being done in this manner. On July 30, 2016, Dave Schwartz died after a long battle with cancer. He had continued to appear as co-anchor almost until his death. He was 63. On October 26, 2016, Liana Brackett joined The Weather Channel as an on-camera meteorologist working with Chris Warren from 3-6pm on weekdays. On June 4, 2018, Weather Center Live was shortened an hour, now ending at 5pm ET with Weather Underground taking over that hour. Mark Elliot and Alex Wallace host from 9am-1pm ET and Chris Warren and Liana Brackett host from 1pm-5pm ET. On June 9, 2018, Weekend Recharge, the weekend version of Weather Center Live, was extended to another hour, ending at 1pm. This is due to AMHQ shortened by one hour, now starting at 6am. On December 2, 2018, Weather Center Live began to be known as The Weather Channel Live on, and only on, electronic program guide schedules.

The other component is the pure-error sum of squares. The pure-error sum of squares is the sum of squared deviations of each value of the dependent variable from the average value over all observations sharing its independent variable value(s). These are errors that could never be avoided by any predictive equation that assigned a predicted value for the dependent variable as a function of the value(s) of the independent variable(s). The remainder of the residual sum of squares is attributed to lack of fit of the model since it would be mathematically possible to eliminate these errors entirely.  Sketch of the idea  In order for the lack-of-fit sum of squares to differ from the sum of squares of residuals, there must be more than one value of the response variable for at least one of the values of the set of predictor variables. For example, consider fitting a line : y = \\\\alpha x + \\\\beta \\\\, by the method of least squares. One takes as estimates of Œ± and Œ≤ the values that minimize the sum of squares of residuals, i.e., the sum of squares of the differences between the observed y-value and the fitted y-value. To have a lack-of-fit sum of squares that differs from the residual sum of squares, one must observe more than one y-value for each of one or more of the x-values. One then partitions the \\"sum of squares due to error\\", i.e., the sum of squares of residuals, into two components: : sum of squares due to error = (sum of squares due to \\"pure\\" error) + (sum of squares due to lack of fit). The sum of squares due to \\"pure\\" error is the sum of squares of the differences between each observed y-value and the average of all y-values corresponding to the same x-value. The sum of squares due to lack of fit is the weighted sum of squares of differences between each average of y-values corresponding to the same x-value and the corresponding fitted y-value, the weight in each case being simply the number of observed y-values for that x-value. Because it is a property of least squares regression that the vector whose components are \\"pure errors\\" and the vector of lack-of-fit components are orthogonal to each other, the following equality holds: : \\\\begin{align} &\\\\sum (\\\\text{observed value} - \\\\text{fitted value})^2 && \\\\text{(error)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad = \\\\sum (\\\\text{observed value} - \\\\text{local average})^2 && \\\\text{(pure error)} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &\\\\qquad\\\\qquad {} + \\\\sum \\\\text{weight}\\\\times (\\\\text{local average} - \\\\text{fitted value})^2 && \\\\text{(lack of fit)} \\\\end{align} Hence the residual sum of squares has been completely decomposed into two components.  Mathematical details  Consider fitting a line with one predictor variable. Define i as an index of each of the n distinct x values, j as an index of the response variable observations for a given x value, and ni as the number of y values associated with the i th x value. The value of each response variable observation can be represented by : Y_{ij} = \\\\alpha x_i + \\\\beta + \\\\varepsilon_{ij},\\\\qquad i = 1,\\\\dots, n,\\\\quad j = 1,\\\\dots,n_i. Let : \\\\widehat\\\\alpha, \\\\widehat\\\\beta \\\\, be the least squares estimates of the unobservable parameters Œ± and Œ≤ based on the observed values of x i and Y i j. Let : \\\\widehat Y_i = \\\\widehat\\\\alpha x_i + \\\\widehat\\\\beta \\\\, be the fitted values of the response variable. Then : \\\\widehat\\\\varepsilon_{ij} = Y_{ij} - \\\\widehat Y_i \\\\, are the residuals, which are observable estimates of the unobservable values of the error term Œµ ij. Because of the nature of the method of least squares, the whole vector of residuals, with : N = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n n_i scalar components, necessarily satisfies the two constraints : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\widehat\\\\varepsilon_{ij} = 0 \\\\, : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left(x_i \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\widehat\\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\right) = 0. \\\\, It is thus constrained to lie in an (N ‚àí 2)-dimensional subspace of R N, i.e. there are N ‚àí 2 \\"degrees of freedom for error\\". Now let : \\\\overline{Y}_{i\\\\bullet} = \\\\frac{1}{n_i} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} Y_{ij} be the average of all Y-values associated with the i th x-value. We partition the sum of squares due to error into two components: : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\widehat\\\\varepsilon_{ij}^{\\\\,2} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\left( Y_{ij} - \\\\widehat Y_i \\\\right)^2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\underbrace{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\left(Y_{ij} - \\\\overline Y_{i\\\\bullet}\\\\right)^2 }_\\\\text{(sum of squares due to pure error)} \\\\+ \\\\underbrace{ \\\\sum_{i=1}^n n_i \\\\left( \\\\overline Y_{i\\\\bullet} - \\\\widehat Y_i \\\\right)^2. }_\\\\text{(sum of squares due to lack of fit)} \\\\end{align}  Probability distributions   Sums of squares  Suppose the error terms Œµ i j are independent and normally distributed with expected value 0 and variance œÉ2. We treat x i as constant rather than random. Then the response variables Y i j are random only because the errors Œµ i j are random. It can be shown to follow that if the straight- line model is correct, then the sum of squares due to error divided by the error variance, : \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\widehat\\\\varepsilon_{ij}^{\\\\,2} has a chi-squared distribution with N ‚àí 2 degrees of freedom. Moreover, given the total number of observations N, the number of levels of the independent variable n, and the number of parameters in the model p: * The sum of squares due to pure error, divided by the error variance œÉ2, has a chi-squared distribution with N ‚àí n degrees of freedom; * The sum of squares due to lack of fit, divided by the error variance œÉ2, has a chi-squared distribution with n ‚àí p degrees of freedom (here p = 2 as there are two parameters in the straight-line model); * The two sums of squares are probabilistically independent.  The test statistic  It then follows that the statistic : \\\\begin{align} F & = \\\\frac{ \\\\text{lack-of-fit sum of squares} /\\\\text{degrees of freedom} }{\\\\text{pure-error sum of squares} / \\\\text{degrees of freedom} } \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[8pt] & = \\\\frac{\\\\left.\\\\sum_{i=1}^n n_i \\\\left( \\\\overline Y_{i\\\\bullet} - \\\\widehat Y_i \\\\right)^2\\\\right/ (n-p)}{\\\\left.\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} \\\\left(Y_{ij} - \\\\overline Y_{i\\\\bullet}\\\\right)^2 \\\\right/ (N - n)} \\\\end{align} has an F-distribution with the corresponding number of degrees of freedom in the numerator and the denominator, provided that the model is correct. If the model is wrong, then the probability distribution of the denominator is still as stated above, and the numerator and denominator are still independent. But the numerator then has a noncentral chi-squared distribution, and consequently the quotient as a whole has a non-central F-distribution. One uses this F-statistic to test the null hypothesis that the linear model is correct. Since the non-central F-distribution is stochastically larger than the (central) F-distribution, one rejects the null hypothesis if the F-statistic is larger than the critical F value. The critical value corresponds to the cumulative distribution function of the F distribution with x equal to the desired confidence level, and degrees of freedom d1 = (n ‚àí p) and d2 = (N ‚àí n). The assumptions of normal distribution of errors and independence can be shown to entail that this lack-of-fit test is the likelihood-ratio test of this null hypothesis.
