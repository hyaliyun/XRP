AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning. The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring becoming an expert in the field first. Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models.  Comparison to the standard approach  In a typical machine learning application, practitioners have a set of input data points to train on. The raw data may not be in a form that all algorithms can be applied to it. To make the data amenable for machine learning, an expert may have to apply appropriate data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, and feature selection methods. After these steps, practitioners must then perform algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization to maximize the predictive performance of their model. All of these steps induce challenges, accumulating to a significant hurdle to get started with machine learning. AutoML dramatically simplifies these steps for non-experts. Targets of automation Automated machine learning can target various stages of the machine learning process. Steps to automate are: *Data preparation and ingestion (from raw data and miscellaneous formats)  Column type detection; e.g., boolean, discrete numerical, continuous numerical, or text  Column intent detection; e.g., target/label, stratification field, numerical feature, categorical text feature, or free text feature  Task detection; e.g., binary classification, regression, clustering, or ranking *Feature engineering Feature selection  Feature extraction  Meta learning and transfer learning  Detection and handling of skewed data and/or missing values *Model selection * Hyperparameter optimization of the learning algorithm and featurization * Pipeline selection under time, memory, and complexity constraints * Selection of evaluation metrics and validation procedures * Problem checking  Leakage detection  Misconfiguration detection * Analysis of results obtained * User interfaces and visualizations for automated machine learning See also * Neural architecture search * Neuroevolution * Self-tuning * Neural Network Intelligence References Machine learning Artificial intelligence ","title":"Automated machine learning"},{"id":"55843842","title":"Claudio B√°ez"},{"id":"55843847","text":"Siddhikali Temple is a Hindu temple located in Thimi, Nepal.

She lives in Johannesburg. Since 2004, her art has featured in international exhibitions including at the Paris Art Fair at the Grand Palais in Paris.  Biography  She was born in 1973 in Blantyre, Malawi, and graduated in Fine Arts from Rhodes University, South Africa. Her mother worked in the textiles industry on sewing and embroidery. In her artistic training, she tested several modes of expression, but finally became passionate about the work of silk, both because of the interest in the fabrics, the luminosity and the effects of reflection of it. She indicated that: \\"Silk has a fabulous quality of reflection but at the same time, I think it is very modern and at the forefront of fashion\\". Working in Gaborone, Botswana, then Johannesburg but also in London, she sought to translate a feminine perspective on her urban environment. She talked about her interest in fashion photography and the narrative approach, for example, of Ellen von Unwerth in her works. Her work has resulted in the production of handbags, using scenes taken from the city of Johannesburg. Also, she has produced collages, using, on the surface of the fabric, text, images, with a pop art influence.and, sometimes, effects including embroidery, beads and mats. In 2020, Templon in Paris presented a solo exhibition of work by the artist, titled Soldier of Love, which explored the themes of domesticity, femininity, and love. Speaking with Jareh Das in Ocula Magazine, the artist explained, 'I feel that at present, we live in a time blighted by a lot of violence and transgression in different forms that we inflict on one other as a society. We hear about it on the news every day. I believe that it is because we do not prioritise love, and that if we did, most of the suffering in the world would come to an end and we would find healing.' Zangewa's 2014 work Constant Gardener is owned by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington, D C. In 2018 Zangewa was the featured artist for the annual FNB JoburgArtFair. In 2019 Zangewa was included in the show I Am‚Ä¶ Contemporary Women Artists of Africa at the National Museum of African Art.

The studio collaborates with established artists, galleries, designers and museums in producing limited edition prints. The studio's clients include White Cube, Fine Art Society, Victoria and Albert Museum, ICA, Tate, Saatchi Gallery, The British Film Institute, and the Royal Academy of Arts. Providing facilities for the production of screenprinting, digital printing, and relief printing, the studio has been used by over 500 artists, including Gavin Turk, David Shrigley, Quentin Blake, Gary Hume, Ben Eine and Jake and Dinos Chapman. Jealous Print Studio also has two gallery spaces, known as Jealous Gallery. Jealous supports its artist collaborators by promoting and selling their art work in the gallery and at international art fairs such as the Affordable Art Fair, London Art Fair and London Original Print Fair.  History  Jealous was founded in Crouch End, North London in 2008 by Dario Illari and Jacquie Ryle, who enlisted the help of screenprinter Matthew Rich. They were soon joined by printmaker and artist Adam Bridgland. The print studio began in a former carpet shop on Park Road, with printing beds occupying a small space in the back of the building, and a gallery space at the front. The gallery was soon named Jealous North, when in 2014, Jealous opened a second space in Shoreditch, East London, formally known as Jealous East. The print studio now contains over 2 floors of print studios, with each floor dedicated to a different stage of the printing process. The gallery space on the ground floor hosts group exhibitions and solo shows of the artists work published in the studio.  Printing  The primary printmaking techniques used at Jealous Print Studio are screenprinting and digital printing, using water-based inks in their practice. The studio often experiments with mixed media, combining digital printing with hand-pulled screenprinted overlays. Materials such as carborundum, diamond dust and gold leaf are materials often used for overlays. Techniques such as flocking and blind embossing are also practiced. The studio collaborates with artists for experimentational projects. In 2011 the studio screenprinted using mud for Norfolk artist Alison Mitchell, and screenprinted ink onto goat skins for Australian artist Caitlin Yardley. In 2017 bio-artist Sarah Craske collaborated with the studio in screenprinting live bacteria onto pages from a 300-year-old book. The same year saw Hokusai‚Äôs famous Great Wave of Kanagawa screenprinted onto Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason‚Äôs drumskins, that were later displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum for Pink Floyd: Their Mortal Remains.  Projects and collaborations  In November 2014 Jealous Print Studio and artist Anthony Burrill were invited to participate in a launch by the Crafts Council in the House of Commons. Multiple screenprint beds were set up to live print the cover of the Manifesto Our Future Is In The Making, aimed to emphasize the importance of craft-making in future education. In May 2017 Jealous were invited to live print at the opening of the 57th Venice Biennale in the Diaspora Pavilion. A print edition made in the Jealous Print Studio was later released by emerging British artist Khadija Saye, whose work was featured at the Biennale. The event garnerned media attention proceeding the event due to the artists involvement in the Grenfell Tower Fire disaster, and the prints were displayed in Tate Britain in commemoration of her life. In 2010 Jealous collaborated with London design agency Graphic Thought Facility to produce nthe extraordinary-heroes-exhibition at theImperial War Museum.https://www.creativereview.co.uk/in-her- hands/extraordinary-heroes-exhibition-1-of-3-deuchars-was-recently-asked-to- work-on-the-extraordinary-heroes-exhibition-at-the-imperial-war-museum-which- displays-over-200-victoria-and-george-cross-medal/ signage In 2013 they then collaborated to produce a screenprinted poster for the National Theatre to commemorate their 50th anniversary. Further notable artist collaborations in the studio include Kelley Walker, Chris Levine, Rose Wylie, Margaret Calvert, Quentin Blake, Frances Stark, Cary Kwok and Judy Blame. = The Jealous Prize = The Jealous Prize is an annual competition offered to MA graduates from major London Art Colleges to win an all-expenses paid artist residency in the Jealous Print Studio. Previous winners include Adam Dix who has also been recognised by the Future Map and Catlin Art Prize; Ann-Marie James who has since been awarded the Derek Hill Foundation Scholarship at The British School at Rome and is represented by Karsten Schubert Gallery; Charlie Billingham, whose work has been exhibited at the Royal Academy and Saatchi Gallery; and Erica Donovan, whose work includes a commission to transform The Artist's Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale. In 2014 Saatchi Gallery dedicated a month-long exhibition to the Jealous Prize in their Prints and Editions department. The winner's editions are accepted into the Victoria & Albert Museum permanent collection on a yearly basis. = Jealous Needs You = Jealous Needs You is an ongoing project from Jealous Print Studio that invites artists, graphic designers and illustrators of all levels of experience and backgrounds to submit artworks to make up a portfolio of screenprint editions. The chosen designs are then produced as 2 or 3 colour screenprints and a limited edition of 36, giving all artists the same constraints to work within. Previous year's portfolios have included submissions from artists such as Rob Ryan, Marion Deuchars, Magnus Gjoen and Rose Blake. Each portfolio of prints are then displayed in an annual exhibition at Saatchi Gallery.  Charity projects  In 2014, Jealous and artist Charming Baker were approached by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in association with War Child UK. They were asked to create a visual focal point and accompanying limited edition print in preparation for the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, co-chaired by Angelina Jolie and Foreign Secretary William Hague. The screenprint editions were produced in the Jealous Studio, and released at the opening of the Global Summit at the Excel on 10 June. The studio have produced print editions for numerous charities, including portfolios such as Ghost of Gone Birds for Birdlife International Trust and Art on a Postcard for The Hepatitis C Trust, featuring artists such as Anita Klein, Rachel Howard, John Wragg and Mick Rooney RA. In 2016, Jealous produced print editions by artists Ben Eine and Charming Baker to raise funds for charities in aid of homelessness. The print entitled ‚ÄòHome Sweet Homeless‚Äô by Ben Eine was created in support of the charity Shelter. The project gained notable media attention due to its production and launch in the gallery featuring on Sky Arts ‚ÄòThe Art Show‚Äô in June 2017. In April 2016, Jealous and Ben Eine collaborated with leading street vendor magazine The Big Issue to celebrate 200 million sales. The three magazine covers, reading ‚ÄòCelebrate‚Äô, in Ben Eine's recognisable typography, were later produced as screenprinted editions and sold in aid of The Big Issue.  Street art  Jealous collaborates with worldwide Street artists, producing original print editions for well known street artists such as Ben Eine, Niels Shoe Meulman, Jon Burgerman, Inkie and Otto Schade. The Rooftop Mural project atop the Jealous East building invites street artists to create murals on the wall overlooking East London.

It discusses how politicians gain and retain political power. Bueno de Mesquita is a fellow at the Hoover Institution. His co-writer is also an academic, and both are political scientists. Michael Moynihan of The Wall Street Journal stated that the writing style is similar to that of Freakonomics. Moynihan added that the conclusions the book makes originate from the fields of economics, history, and political science, leading him to call the authors \\"polymathic\\". Mesquita and Smith, with other authors, previously wrote about the \\"selectorate\\" concept in the academic book The Logic of Political Survival.  Contents  Bueno de Mesquita and Smith argue that politicians, regardless of whether they are in authoritarian dictatorships or in democracies, must stay in power by pleasing a core inner circle of power brokers, and that politicians must engage in self-interested behavior in order to stay in power. They argued that the motives of politicians are \\"To come to power, to stay in power and, to the extent that they can, to keep control over money.\\" The main difference between the scenarios of democratic and authoritarian politicians is that democratic politicians have to please a large number of power brokers and/or the public at large while authoritarian ones please relatively small circles. These differences are illustrated in the infrastructure developed in authoritarian and democratic societies. In addition, authoritarian rulers, due to their smaller circles of power brokers, tend to have longer periods of power. The authors also stated that politicians usually do beneficial acts when these acts benefit them or when they must do the acts. The book also argues that aid to third-world countries benefits authoritarian governments. Occasionally terminologies differ in sections of the book. Samuel Brittan of the Financial Times argued that this is sometimes confusing.  Reception  Martin Patriquin of Macleans wrote that the authors \\"make a frightfully good argument by turning an old clich√© on its ear. Power doesn‚Äôt corrupt. Rather, power inevitably attracts the corrupted.\\" Ed Howker of The Guardian stated that the book assumes all politicians act rationally, and that its attitude was so cynical \\"that it made me flinch on more than one occasion.\\" He added that \\"it's good to read the evidence\\" of how authoritarian governments and systems operate. Moynihan wrote that the book \\"contains many points that are common- sensical\\". Moynihan added that there are some minor errors in fact in the book due to its large scope. Brittan wrote that it is \\"most illuminating in the cases of dictatorships in the developing world or highly imperfect democracies such as Russia or Iran.\\" Theodore McLaughlin of the University of Montreal concluded that it is a \\"serviceable introduction\\" and \\"bracing book that does indeed connect the dots across a wide array of political phenomena.\\" McLaughlin criticized what he perceived were the book's failure to define what a \\"winning coalition\\" and \\"selectorate\\" are and other issues in the analysis.

Biography Osler was born in Bridgwater in 1854 to William and Catherine Taylor. Her Unitarian parents were members of the Birmingham Women's Suffrage Society from its formation. Catherine was their eldest child and she rose through the ranks of the society as she went from treasurer to secretary in 1885. She married Alfred Osler who ran the family firm of F & C Osler of Birmingham, a firm famous for the design and manufacture of fine crystal, exemplified by magnificent pieces such as chandeliers to be found in grand buildings in many parts of the world. Alfred Osler was a member of the Liberals. In 1888 the Women's Liberal Federation had a conference in Birmingham and Catherine Osler was asked to preside over it. Four years later the Women's Emancipation Union met in Birmingham and Osler was invited to chair a session where she shared her ambition to get women involved in local government. In 1903, she became the President of the Birmingham Women's Suffrage Society. Osler was opposed to the actions of the militant suffragettes and she had written to criticise the actions of the Women's Social and Political Union. However she did not approve of the way the WSPU militants were treated in prison. In 1909, she resigned as President of the Birmingham Women's Liberal Association citing her objection to the Liberal government's policy of force feeding suffragette prisoners. In 1911, Osler joined the executive committee of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Osler was also active in Birmingham trying to establish a role for women in local government. In 1919, Osler was given a master's degree by Birmingham University for her work in support of the social standing of her gender. Osler died in Edgbaston in 1924.

Formed from three smaller units in 1875, it served until 1909. Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. Precursor units On 10 May 1875, three Militia Artillery regiments in Northern Ireland, the Armagh, Londonderry, and Tyrone, two of which were moribund, were merged to form a new unit designated the Mid-Ulster Regiment of Artillery Militia.Litchfield, pp. 113‚Äì4. =Armagh Artillery= The Armagh Artillery was officially formed in County Armagh by December 1854, but it was not until the following April that Captain R.F. Kidd transferred from the Armagh Light Infantry Militia and assumed command of the new unit. Its headquarters (HQ) was at the county town of Armagh. It was embodied during the Crimean War from April 1855 to July 1856.Litchfield, p. 48. The establishment of the Armagh Artillery was small: five officers including a surgeon, seven Non-Commissioned Officers (NCOs), one trumpeter and 100 gunners. Recruiting for the unit appears to have been poor. Training of the Irish Militia was suspended in 1866, when the only officer listed was the surgeon. When training resumed in 1871 the strength returns of the Armagh Artillery showed no men at all. In 1875 it was merged into the MId-Ulster Artillery.Army List, various dates. =Londonderry Artillery Militia= The Londonderry Artillery Militia was authorised in 1854 and officially raised in County Londonderry on 9 January 1855 under the command of Captain Commandant Stewart Blacker, with HQ at Derry. It was the smallest of the artillery militia units, with an establishment of three officers, one surgeon, 5 NCOs, one drummer and 75 gunners. After training was suspended in 1866, the unit's strength returns show no men at all from 1868 to 1874, and it was not revived when training resumed in 1871. It was officially merged into the Mid-Ulster Artillery in 1875.Litchfield, p. 111. In 1882 the Londonderry Militia Light Infantry was converted into a new artillery unit, which existed until 1909. =Tyrone Artillery Militia= The Tyrone Artillery Militia was raised in County Tyrone at the end of April 1855 with an establishment of eight officers, eight NCOs, two drummers and 187 gunners. Its first HQ was at Charlemont, moving to Dungannon in May 1868. Surviving examples of regimental stationery and crockery use the name Royal Tyrone Artillery (following the Royal Tyrone Fusiliers Militia) but this title appears to have been unofficial and does not appear in the Army List.Litchfield, pp140‚Äì1. The Tyrone Artillery was embodied during the Crimean War from September 1855 to July 1856. In 1874 the training returns showed that the unit had 206 men enrolled out of an establishment of 218, and the following year it formed the basis of the Mid-Ulster Artillery. History The Mid-Ulster Artillery Militia was formed at the former Dungannon HQ of the Tyrone Artillery, whose officers and men formed the core of the new unit, which had an establishment strength of 466. Artillery Militia units took precedence in alphabetical order (Armagh was 2): the new unit assumed the precedence number of the Londonderry (21) rather than the Tyrone (28). Ynyr Henry Burges, former High Sheriff of County Tyrone, who had been a captain in the Tyrone Artillery since 11 March 1859, was promoted to Major in the new unit.Burges at the peerage.com. R.J.P. Saunders became commanding officer with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel on 16 February 1889. The paymaster-serjeant was Bernard Kilkeary, a veteran of the 8th Frontier War and Indian Mutiny and a survivor of the Birkenhead disaster.Kilkeary at Birkenhead Survivors. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Antrim unit became the 6th Brigade, North Irish Division, RA. When the North Irish Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Mid-Ulster Artillery (Southern Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. The Mid-Ulster Artillery was embodied during the Second Boer War from 3 May to 6 November 1900. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Dungannon unit taking the title of Mid-Ulster RGA (M). After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Disbandment Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the majority of the officers and men of the Mid-Ulster RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8. Honorary Colonels The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Major The Hon. W. Stuart Knox, formerly of the 21st Foot, son of the Earl of Ranfurly and MP for Dungannon, was appointed to the Tyrone Artillery on 26 March 1867 and continued in that role with the Mid-Ulster Artillery.Burke's, 'Ranfurly'. * Lt-Col R.J.P.

The building is among the protected colonial heritage of Indonesia. Like many other colonial country houses of Jakarta, despite its protection by the government, the lack of interest in the study of the building caused it to slowly fall into disrepair. It was converted into a police station. Design The building is located at Palmerah Barat Street, Palmerah. When the building was completed in 1790, the neighborhood of Palmerah was still a forested area on the edge of Batavia. At the front of the house is a vast garden. The garden and the area surrounding the country house became settlements, mainly farmers and fishermen. Gedong Tinggi Palmerah is a 2-story stone building. The building is constructed in the Transitional Dutch Indies country houses (or Nederlands-Indische stijl) style, an area of Dutch architecture founded in the 18th-century. The Dutch Indies was a transition from the Dutch style that did not acknowledge local weather conditions. This was a step towards a complete assimilation of Javanese architecture where house design recognized the tropical climate. The second floor of the building is constructed in an enclosed European style, while the ground floor is open. The eaves of the roof do not jut out generously to protect the interior from the elements. Corrugated roofs were added just under the roof. History Gedong Tinggi Palmerah was constructed in 1790 by Andries Hartsinck, a high-ranking VOC official. In that period people began to abandon the Old Town of Batavia due to its increasingly unhealthy environment. The 18th-century saw many wealthy residents of Batavia build country houses outside the city wall in the hope that they could live free from the malaria disease plaguing the Old Town. The establishment of the Gedong Tinggi Palmerah was the beginning of the occupation of the area of Palmerah. After Gedong Tinggi Palmerah, Palmerah station was established at the end of the 19th-century to the east of Gedong Tinggi Palmerah. Jalan Palmerah Barat is the main road that connects the country house and the station. Close to Pasar Palmerah, Hartsinck built another country house known as Djipang that was destroyed in 1996. This building is part of the cultural heritage of Jakarta and is protected under the STRL Monument Law 1931 no. 238 and under the supervision of the regional government of Jakarta.  Legacy  Despite the protection, the building is threatened by lack of maintenance, typical of the fate of Dutch Indies country houses in Jakarta. Examples of destroyed country houses of Jakarta include Landhuis Pondok Gede (destroyed in the 1990s to build a mall), Landhuis Cengkareng (destroyed in 1980 for property business purposes), Landhuis Djipang (demolished in 1996), Landhuis Tanjung Timur (burned in 1985 after it was converted into a police dormitory, now only the ruins left). The country house Landhuis Cililitan in Jakarta is still standing; however, its conversion into a police dormitory means that the lack of maintenance by its tenants, as well as the lack of awareness of its cultural value, has threatened its survival. Gedong Tinggi Palmerah is located on the premise of the Palmerah Subdistrict's police station and is partly used as police dormitory.

She became best known for her actions fighting against the Spanish Empire during an incursion near Biriatou in July 1793. Biography Rose-Alexandrine Barreau was born in May 1773 in the Tarn area of France. She married Francois Leyrac on 5 March 1792, and signed up alongside her brother Cyprien Barreau and her new husband for the 2nd Battalion of the Tarn in the Army of the French First Republic. She was listed in records as \\"Liberte\\" Barreau, a \\"son of Jacques and Jeanne Barreau\\". Barreau and the rest of the Battalion were subsequently amalgamated into the 63rd Demi-Brigade. It was against a Spanish Empire incursion into France at Biriatou in July 1793 that she would become known. Under the command of Th√©ophile Corret de la Tour d'Auvergne, they were engaged by the Spanish forces. First, Barreau witnessed the death of her brother, and then her husband was seriously injured. Barreau moved further forward with the other infantry, before rushing into enemy fire where she fired her musket until she ran out of ammunition. At that point, she charged the enemy with her saber. Following the end of the battle, she went to her husband's side and tended his wounds. Follow a year and two months of service, Barreau was discharged from the infantry, as she had been experiencing complications from being six months pregnant. The National Convention granted her 300 livre tournois in recognition of her service, and in the following years she remained in the train following the army as her husband continued to serve. She was written of as a national hero in the 1793 Annales du Civisme et de la Vertu. Barreau received a military pension in 1806, and by 1809 she had five children.

Lapraroscopic presacral neurectomy is an initial surgical intervention for chronic pelvic pain when medical therapy fails.  Mechanism  Most of the sensory pathways from the pelvic viscera pass through the superior hypogastric plexus and inferior hypogastric plexus to the spinal columns. The excision of presacral nerve trunk results in the obstruction of the pain pathway from the hypogastric plexi to the spinal cord. Presacral neurectomy denervates the uterus and causes loss of some bladder sensation. It is believed that pain fibers from the ovary and distal fallopian tubes travel through the ovarian plexus to the vagus nerve, and therefore, bypass the superior hypogastric plexus. Procedure First, a surgical incision is made of the peritoneum overlying the Sacrum#Promontory and extending this incision toward the aortic bifurcation. The inferior mesenteric artery is then identified as the left lateral border of the dissection. A surgical plane can then be carefully developed between the inferior mesenteric artery and the left common iliac vein. The sacral promontory area is identified and can be infiltrated with vasoconstrictive solution or with the use of electrosurgery to reduce blood loss. =Tools= Monopolar or bipolar forceps, or CO2 laser or neodymium can be used for this procedure. Route of surgery Laparotomy or laparoscopy is the preferred route for PSN procedures. A PSN procedure can be safely completed in under an hour and patients discharged the day of surgery. Complications Rarely chylous ascites (0.6%). 10‚Äì15% of patients experience minor bowel and urinary complaints. Efficacy Presacral neurectomy is offered to patients for whom medical therapy for chronic pain relief has failed. The efficacy of the procedure is around 75-80%. Less than 1% of all patients suffer from major complications following the surgery. There is no additional patient benefit of performing combined presacral neurectomy and uterine nerve ablation procedures.

The series is based on the life of a scientist, Frank Olson, who worked for a secret government biological warfare program located at Fort Detrick, Maryland (the USBWL). It focuses on the events leading up to and following his controversial death, which the US government originally claimed was a tragic accident, but later admitted was likely a suicide, caused by a mental breakdown brought on after being unknowingly dosed with LSD, while at a meeting with colleagues from the CIA who were involved in Project MKUltra. It also in present day, follows Frank Olson's son, and discusses his belief that his father may have been murdered due being perceived as a potential security risk. Interspersed between interviews and archival footage, are live action reenactments of the final day's of Frank Olson's life and the various theories involving his death. Plot Wormwood is told through Eric Olson, the son of Frank Olson, an American biological warfare scientist and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, who died under mysterious circumstances in 1953. Nine days after Olson was covertly dosed with LSD by his CIA supervisor as part of Project MKUltra, he plunged to his death from the window of a hotel room in New York City. His death was initially regarded as a suicide, but subsequent investigations have raised questions of a coverup of an alleged murder. Wormwood is an allusion to a Bible verse about a star that makes everything bitter, an allusion to biological weapons (in particular, allegations of biological warfare in the Korean War), and the effect of Eric Olson's search for a resolution regarding the death of his father for 60 years. Errol Morris said that \\"What Wormwood tries to do is tell a story about how we know what we know and how reliable is that knowledge.\\" A key piece of evidence the film relies on is a CIA assassination manual from 1953, which instructs agents, \\"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface.\\" Cast =Interviews= * Eric Olson *David Rudovsky, family attorney *Seymour Hersh * Stephen Saracco =Reenactments= * Peter Sarsgaard as Frank Olson ‚Äì Biochemist * Molly Parker as Alice Olson ‚Äì Wife * Christian Camargo as Dr. Robert Lashbrook ‚Äì CIA * Scott Shepherd as Lt.

Frontispiece from New Library of Fine Sciences and Freyen Arts, Volume 26.1. Biography He was the son of Catharina Elisabeth Heinecken, an artist and alchemist, and Paul Heinecken, a painter and architect in L√ºbeck, Germany. His younger brother Christian Heinrich Heineken (1721-1725) was a child prodigy known as \\"the infant scholar of L√ºbeck\\". Beginning in 1724, Heineken studied literature and law at the Leipzig University and the University of Halle. He became a private tutor around 1730, first in the household of Johann Ulrich K√∂nig, a Dresden court poet, and afterwards with Count Alexander von Sulkowsky. In 1739, he became the private secretary and librarian for Count Heinrich von Br√ºhl, an important statesman and art collector. In 1746, King Augustus III of Poland appointed him director of the royal collection of prints and drawings. Tasked with adding to the collection, he developed a wide network embracing artists, scholars, and collectors. Heineken was especially interested in woodcuts and engravings from the period before Albrecht D√ºrer and bought many examples for the collection. Among his acquisitions were paintings by Correggio and Raphael. He was knighted as a Reichsritter in 1749. In 1756, at the outset of the Seven Years‚Äô War, the Prussians arrested Heineken and imprisoned him in the Dresden town hall. After the war, he was attacked for financial mismanagement, largely because of his close connection with Br√ºhl. He was reimprisoned, charged with embezzlement, and stripped of office. Although eventually acquitted, he was required to leave Dresden. Heineken spent the remainder of his life writing books about art in both German and French. He became known as an expert on the origins of engraving and other forms of printing. Some of his later books were printed by the Leipzig publisher Johann Gottlob Immanuel Breitkopf. For a time, Heineken owned Altd√∂bern Castle, a baroque building in Brandenburg, Germany.

Biochemically, N-acetyltaurine is formed as a result of an acetylation of taurine. The main substrate for this reaction is acetate. An increase of endogenous N-acetyltaurine concentrations was observed after the consumption of alcohol and after extended physical activity (ketoacidosis).  History  N-Acetyltaurine was first mentioned in 1990 as a compound in the droplets of the orb spider's viscid spiral. Based on its high hygroscopicity, N-acetyltaurine is an important ingredient which ensures the spider web's flexibility. As a biomarker for ethanol metabolism, N-acetyltaurine was first mentioned in a mice study in 2012. Another study in 2015 focused on the effect of endurance training on an increase in N-acetyltaurine concentrations. The first study focusing on the forensic context of alcohol biomarker analysis in human urine was published in 2016. One year later, in 2017 an evaluation of N-acetyltaurine as an alcoholmarker in human blood followed.  Significance as an alcohol marker  N-Acetyltaurine is a direct alcohol biomarker which represents the oxidative pathway of ethanol metabolism. Other direct alcohol biomarkers such as fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), ethyl glucuronide, ethyl sulfate, and phosphatidylethanol reflect the non-oxidative pathway of alcohol metabolism, based on conjunction reactions (biotransformation). The fact that N-acetyltaurine is an endogenous metabolite reduces its significane as an alcohol biomarker: A distinction between endogenous N-acetyltaurine concentrations and alcohol induced concentrations is necessary. During a drinking study with a target blood alcohol concentrations of 0.8 g/kg, an alcohol induced concentration of N-acetyltaurine which was about ten folds higher than the endogenous concentration was observed. In blood the alcohol induced increase was only twofold. Based on these observations, it was concluded that N-acetyltaurine is excreted very efficiently by the kidney.  Analytics  N-Acetyltaurine can be quantified by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Due to the high hydrophilicity of N-acetyltaurine, the hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) is the method of choice in order to separate the analyte from the matrix components.

Summary The novel is in the third person, and the narration is mostly from the perspective of the main character, Steingr√≠mur Valur Orrason (known as Valur), though the perspective sometimes switches, particularly to Valur's friend and contemporary R√∫tur Bj√∂rn Mar√≠n√≥sson (born in 1968). The present time of the narrative runs from spring 2008 to 6 October 2008. Much of the novel, however, comprises flashbacks to Valur's youth in the down-at-heel Reykjav√≠k suburb of Brei√∞holt. The flashbacks in the novel gradually reveal that Valur, R√∫tur and one Steinbj√∂rn Eyj√≥lfsson were friends together in Brei√∞holt and involved in minor criminal activity portrayed as characteristic of this rough suburb. However, they become interested in radical left-wing activism, gaining particular inspiration from the Red Army Faction. Their childhood escapades establish the depth of the friendship between Valur and R√∫tur, and Steinbj√∂rn's tendency to lay plans but to stay away from the action itself. The escapades also establish their antagonism towards the main bully in their neighbourhood, Krummi krunk. Valur falls in love with and begins a relationship with a girl called Ger√∞ur. The culmination of the radical activism of Valur, R√∫tur and Steinbj√∂rn is a stunt whereby they photobomb the October 1986 Reykjav√≠k Summit, raising a banner saying 'Destroy the fascist Soviet states of America!', while Valur threatens the assembly with a dummy M16 gun. Valur is shot and slightly wounded by a secret service agent and arrested, while a stray bullet hits another bodyguard in the eye. Valur escapes prosecution, however, by fleeing on his brother's passport to the East German part of Berlin, where the state later gives him a new identity, as Magnus Heinz. R√∫tur and Steinbj√∂rn escape the attention of the police. In East Germany, Valur meets a new partner, a Polish radical socialist called Aldona, though after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Ger√∞ur visits briefly and has sex with Valur, leaving when she realises that Valur has a partner. Valur later has a child by Aldona called L√°ra. Valur's best friend in Berlin is Karl-Elke, whom he helps escape to West Germany, and who returns to East Berlin after the fall of the Berlin Wall to start a cafe. In the present time of the novel, Valur returns to Iceland for the first time, still a wanted man, because Ger√∞ur reveals to him that he has a daughter by her, Kolbr√°. Kolbr√°, now 18, is in trouble, and Ger√∞ur hopes that Valur can help. It is evident that Valur and Ger√∞ur still have strong feelings for each other. Meanwhile, R√∫tur has become one of Iceland's leading financiers, heading up IS Capital, and Steinbj√∂rn has become the populist leader of the Frelsisflokkurinn ('freedom party'). Valur tries to meet Kolbr√° and establishes that she has joined a gang run by Krummi krunk (now a powerful criminal known as Tungli√∞ ['the moon']). He follows Kolbr√° on what turns out to be a break-in ordered by Krummi during which she steals a package from an Icelandic finance company called AUR Investment. Gradually Valur succeeds in developing a relationship with Kolbr√° and learns that she dislikes her stepfather, Arngr√≠mur. Meanwhile, R√∫tur and Steinbj√∂rn follow up on a long-neglected promise to try to get Valur's charges dropped, and the reader becomes aware that they have some connection with Krummi's criminal activities. Valur's presence in Iceland is leaked to the press, leading to the headline 'Hry√∞juverkama√∞urinn sn√Ωr heim' appearing in the paper. R√∫tur smuggles Valur and Kolbr√° out of the country in his private jet. It emerges that Kolbr√° has with her a package of cocaine that she was supposed to give to Krummi. Kolbr√° meets Valur's family in Germany but absconds to return Krummi's drugs. R√∫tur then arranges Valur's return to Iceland so that he can sign an agreement with the state for his charges to be dropped. Valur then takes Ger√∞ur and Kolbr√° on a road trip to visit his dying mother in Neskaupsta√∞ur, borrowing a car from R√∫tur. The same day, R√∫tur's wife Hildur holds an extravagant and highly public fortieth birthday party for her reluctant husband. Realising that Hildur's present to R√∫tur is in the car, Valur tries to drop it at the party, but is recognised by Hildur, and flees. R√∫tur, fed up with the tedium of his life as a financier, joins Valur and the others on the road-trip. It is announced on national radio that Valur is wanted in connection with the break-in at AUR Investment. Valur visits his mother; Kolbr√° realises that R√∫tur and Steinbj√∂rn are the ultimate power behind the break-in and drugs trafficking that Krummi has involved her in (the drugs being a sidenote to a theft of share-certificates); R√∫tur has sex with Ger√∞ur, who has realised she loves him more than she loves Valur; Kolbr√° remonstrates with R√∫tur; and she and Valur turn themselves into the police. Valur is sentenced for both the break-in and his previous misdemeanours to a tough sentence of about a decade in prison; Kolbr√° to one year; R√∫tur to three and a half; and Steinbj√∂rn manages to avoid conviction. R√∫tur avoids imprisonment, however, by absconding. The novel closes with Valur adjusting to life in prison and getting to know Kolbr√° there; but Aldona, Karl-Elke, and R√∫tur manage a cunning break-out, and together with Valur take ship back to Germany. As they do so, Geir Haarde makes his famous Gu√∞ blessi √çsland speech, signalling the imminent collapse of Iceland's financial system.

She was the niece of Blaise Pascal, and wrote a biography of her uncle that has been preserved. The miracle of the Holy Thorn  Marguerite P√©rier was born in Clermont-Ferrand on 6 April 1646. She was the third of six children of Florin P√©rier (died 1672), Seigneur de Bienassis, and Gilberte Pascal (1620‚Äì1668). She was the niece and goddaughter of Blaise Pascal. Her father was interested in mathematics and collaborated with Blaise Pascal in various scientific experiments. He would publish some of Pascal's treatises after Pascal died. Marguerite was placed in the care of Port-Royal Abbey, Paris, in January 1654. Since the previous year she had been suffering from a serious eye problem described as a \\"lacrimal fistula\\". Preparations were being made to treat it surgically when on 24 March 1656 the child declared herself cured from placing her eye against a reliquary containing part of Christ's crown of thorns. Various doctors judged the cure miraculous in the weeks that followed. However, Guy Patin, former dean of the Paris Faculty of Medicine, disputed the testimony of \\"these approvers of miracles\\". He said that some were too closely associated with Port-Royal to avoid bias, and others were unqualified \\"barber surgeons\\". The event was widely publicized and for a while stopped the persecutions against the abbey. This miracle was central to the politico-religious debates of the time. The Jansenists saw it as a sign of God's support for their cause. Father Fran√ßois Annat, Jesuit and confessor of the king, responded with Le Rabat-joie des jans√©nistes. Without questioning the reality of the miracle, which was recognized by the church, he strongly attacked Port-Royal and interpreted the event as an invitation from God to abandon the Jansenist heresy. Antoine Arnauld and S√©bastien-Joseph du Cambout responded to Annat. According to Gilberte P√©rier in her Vie de Pascal, her brother experienced renewed certainty and joy by the grace of God to his goddaughter. It helped bring about the reconciliation between Pascal and his sister, and the faith preached at Port-Royal. According to legend the episode was the starting point of Pascal's reflections, recorded in his Pens√©es. Pascal addressed his seventeenth Provincial Letter to Father Annat. However the miracle would be challenged later: medical knowledge has evolved. Marguerite probably only suffered from a tear duct obstruction. Austere and retired life  In 1661 all the residents of Port-Royal were thrown out. Marguerite P√©rier then led a secluded life, divided between Paris and Clermont. However, she maintained strong links with her friends of Port-Royal. In 1700, on the request of her brother Canon Louis P√©rier, she accepted the charge of running the H√¥tel-Dieu in Clermont-Ferrand, but gave up this position in 1702 in a difficult political environment. She devoted herself to charitable works, settled permanently with her brother in Clermont-Ferrand and founded a mission in Cournon-d'Auvergne. After the death of her brother in 1713 she devoted herself to the memory of Port-Royal by writing her memoirs (since lost) and Additions au n√©crologe de Port-Royal (Additions to the Obituaries of Port-Royal) and by reviewing writings about her uncle. She then sold her property, established the general hospital of Clermont as her universal legatee (and thus the legatee of the Pascal and P√©rier families) and bequeathed her uncle's papers and one of his arithmetic machines to the Oratory of Jesus. She remained faithful to Jansenism until the end, appealing the bull Unigenitus in 1720. She was at first denied the last sacraments, which she obtained only on the express authority of the Bishop of Clermont. She died on 14 April 1733, 71 years after her uncle, at the age of 87, a great age at that time. An ex-voto painting of the young Marguerite P√©rier kneeling at the altar that held the reliquary was completed in 1657 and has been preserved. It has been attributed to Fran√ßois Quesnel. Her biographies of her mother and her uncle Blaise Pascal have also been preserved, and are valuable historical sources.

Life Born in Darlington as Sophia Pease, she was brought up as a Quaker and as an activist in liberal politics. Her parents were John Pease who was a Quaker and a director of the Stockton and Darlington Railway and Sophia Pease who was also a Quaker. She and her sister Mary Anna were educated at home, and for one year at a school in Frenchay, where she met Sarah Sturge and Theodore Fry. She developed an interest in education for the working class, and started running weekly training for pupil-teachers, and ran cookery classes. Sophia married Fry in 1862, the couple settling in Darlington, and had eight children. Sophia was a founder of the Girls' Friends Day School in Bristol and was active in the North of England College, run by the British and Foreign School Society. At the 1880 UK general election, Theodore was elected as the Member of Parliament for Darlington and, inspired by this and by William Gladstone's Midlothian Campaign, Sophia formed a Women's Liberal Association in the town in 1881. While there was not yet consensus that women should play a role in politics, Fry was determined that women should campaign for the Liberal Party. She corresponded with members of various women's liberal associations around the country, and in 1886 invited fifteen of them to her house to discuss forming a national federation. This was agreed, and the Women's Liberal Federation (WLF) was established in London in 1887, Fry becoming its honorary secretary. It grew rapidly, and had 75,000 members within five years. In 1892, the WLF split over whether to support women's suffrage. While Fry was personally in favour, she felt it was a divisive issue and should not become the policy of the group. As a result, when the policy was voted in, she left to become a founder of the rival Women's National Liberal Association, serving as its vice-president. Theodore was made a baronet in 1894, so Sophia became Lady Fry. In 1896, the couple holidayed in Italy, but she suffered a severe accident, and died in March 1897 in Biarritz.

The series starred Julie Walters as Angela Maurer, a mother who seeks help from a local journalist after her son, Christopher, is killed the day after his 21st birthday. Each episode focuses on a different character who is somehow linked to the story through Angela, including the journalist, a shopkeeper, a police detective and a witness to the crime itself. The serial was written by playwright Abi Morgan, and directed by Beeban Kidron. Producer Rebecca de Souza said of the series; \\"Unless we've had a personal experience of murder we think we understand it because we've all seen investigations on TV or read about them in the newspapers. They are generally presented in a particular way. The focus tends to be on the victim and the police investigation. We wanted to explore the idea that, alongside the immediate family, many people are affected by murder ‚Äì some in surprising ways.\\" Writer Abi Morgan said of her inspirations for the series. \\"Their stories were so incredible, there was a strong sense that they had been touched by madness. I wanted to capture the intensity of what they were living through as well as the odd normality of it. Their experiences had a surreal sense about them, but at the same time they had to carry on with their lives. What keeps Angela going is her drive to find out who did it, but, once the investigation is over, there really is nowhere else to go. You just have to live with it.\\" Walters was awarded a BAFTA television award in 2003 for Best Actress for her role as Angela Maurer. The series averaged around 3 million viewers, with the first episode notably beating ER in the ratings. Notably, the series has never been released on VHS or DVD.

She became one of three trustees running Bedford College. At the time Bedford College was one of the few places where women might receive something approaching university level education. Bedford College was said to be the first British institution run by women Early years Smith was born in Dublin, in Ireland, the daughter of John Smith (1792-1828) and his wife, Mary Murphy. Her father was a barrister, but he died in 1828, and Mary then moved the family to various locations in England before settling in Ryde on the Isle of Wight. Smith had thirteen siblings, with her younger brother Henry John Stephen Smith becoming a prominent mathematician. Smith developed a strong interest in languages, teaching herself Hebrew when she was only seven years old. She later traveled widely around Europe, indulging her interest in European literature. Career In the 1860s, Smith moved to Oxford, where her brother was working, and organised a series of lectures for women by professors affiliated with the University of Oxford. Becoming known as an expert on women's education, she was called as a witness to the 1864 Royal Commission on Schools. As a result of its recommendations, school boards were formed across England and Wales in 1870, and Smith was elected to the Oxford School Board - the only woman elected in Oxford, and one of only seven across England. Other members of the school board determined that education in the city should remain run by religious organisations, but Smith argued that they should instead set up a non-denominational board school. She was unsuccessful in this, and stood down from the board in 1873, when her brother died. In 1879, Smith was a founder of Somerville College, one of the first two Oxford colleges for women. She served on its council, and also became a trustee of Bedford College, London. The founder of Bedford College, Elizabeth Reid died in 1866 and left the college in the hands of Eliza Bostock, Jane Martineau and Smith. The three of them were concerned that Bedford College School was to become Anglican under the head, Francis Martin. They closed the school.

The Robien Package effectively increased the number of urban new constructions, especially in certain medium-sized cities. Named after the politician Gilles de Robien (UMP- UDF) and enacted under the Raffarin government, the law established a project to introduce fiscal benefits to investors owning rental properties meeting certain criteria and certain policyholders of the Soci√©t√© civile de placement immobilier. The project received some criticism, not least for giving incentive for some private investors, particularly those with little experience, to purchase real estate from unscrupulous real estate developers and in areas under construction in smaller cities where the rental market became quickly saturated. Consequentially, the investors were unable to benefit from the financial benefits of the law as they were unable to rent them out for the duration expected by the project.

Early life Darnell Hunt graduated from the University of Southern California, where he earned a bachelor's degree in Journalism in 1984. He earned a master's in Business Administration from Georgetown University in 1988, and a PhD from UCLA in 1994. Career Hunt began teaching at UCLA in 1991, initially as a graduate student; he later became a full professor of Sociology and African American Studies. He was the chair of the Sociology department, and the director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies, where he was succeeded by History professor Kelly Lytle Hernandez. Since July 2017, Hunt has served as the dean of Social Sciences. Hunt is the author of two books, and the editor of two more books. He has also published an annual report on the lack of diversity in the film industry since 2014. The 2017 report, which was commissioned by the Color of Change, a non-profit civil rights advocacy organization, showed that very few television writers were black. To increase their share, Hunt suggested television producers use the Rooney Rule during their interviewing process. His first book, Screening the Los Angeles \\"Riots:\\" Race, Seeing and Resistance, looks at the way white, black and Hispanic television viewers understood the 1992 Los Angeles riots. In a review for Contemporary Sociology, professor S. Craig Watkins of the University of Texas at Austin called it \\"a highly original, insightful, and essential piece of research.\\" However, in a review for the Revue fran√ßaise de sociologie, Julien Damon regretted that Hunt did not look at the way Koreans were impacted by the riots; he added that other axes of subjectivity than race like \\"age, sex, profession and income levels\\" would have made the analysis more comprehensive. His second book, O.J. Simpson Facts and Fictions: News Rituals in the Construction of Reality, is about the O. J. Simpson murder case. Hunt subsequently edited two books. His third book, Channeling Blackness: Studies on Television and Race in America, was about the way blacks are portrayed on television. His fourth book, Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities, co-edited with Ana-Christina Ram√≥n, the Assistant Director of the Ralph J.

The Journal of American History published a mixed review by Lawrence B. de Graaf, a History professor at California State University, Fullerton. For de Graaf, \\"This book should be in any collection on recent African American life and on Los Angeles, but next to more comprehensive historical works.\\" In particular, he criticized the lack of attention paid to blacks who live just outside Los Angeles, or to the black middle class. Reviewing it for The Journal of African American History, John H. Barnhill praised the book, writing \\"Scholarly excellence characterizes many of the articles.\\" He concluded, \\"the volume provides a great deal of direction for those seeking to understand the background to and current state of the African American urban experience in the 21st century.\\" Works  References Living people University of Southern California alumni McDonough School of Business alumni University of California, Los Angeles alumni University of California, Los Angeles faculty American university and college faculty deans American sociologists African-American social scientists 1962 births ","title":"Darnell Hunt"},{"id":"55845694","text":"People's Anti-Imperialist Association () was a political party in Xinjiang, China during the rule of Sheng Shicai, between 1935 and 1942.  History  The People's Anti-Imperialist Association was founded by Sheng Shicai in √úr√ºmqi on 1 August 1935. The propaganda outlet of the Association was the Anti-Imperialist War Front. The Sinkiang's Youth and the Sinkiang's Women served as the Association's youth and women's wing respectively. The Association saw a large increase in membership. In 1935 it had 2,489 members, in 1937 the membership grew to 5,281, and in 1939 the Association's membership rose to 10,000. The membership was nationally diverse, and included Han, Hui and various Turkic peoples. The ideology of the People's Anti-Imperialist Association were the \\"Six Great Policies\\", issued by Sheng in December 1934. The Policies guaranteed his previously enacted \\"Great Eight-Point Manifesto\\" and included \\"anti-imperialism, friendship with the Soviet Union, racial and national equality, clean government, peace and reconstruction\\". Sheng referred to them as \\"a skillful, vital application of Marxism, Leninism, and Stalinism in the conditions of the feudal society of economically and culturally backward Sinkiang\\". They served as the ideological basis of Sheng's rule. With the proclamation of the Six Great Policies, Sheng adopted a new flag with a six-pointed star to represent these policies.

She is a Visiting Professor at School of Physics and Astronomy, Queen Mary University of London.  Early life and education  Parker obtained a physics degree at the University of Sussex in 1980 before moving to Chicago to complete as Borg Warner Fellow for the MA in Conceptual Foundations of Science. She worked in the group of Bob Geroch, with Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar attending one of her seminars.  Research and career  Whilst studying at Chicago, Parker was dismayed at the lack of women in physics. After enjoying a summer working at Adler Planetarium, she returned to the University of Sussex to complete a PGCE in order to encourage more school girls to study it. Parker was head of physics at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys in Canterbury, Kent, which accepts girls at sixth form. At the time Parker taught there, it was estimated that 2% of the cohort of women enrolled in university undergraduate studies across the UK had attended the school. From 2002‚Äì2005, she was a senior lecturer in the School of Physical Sciences at the University of Kent in Canterbury, and was also the Schools first Outreach officer, responsible for pioneering its outreach program at a time when Physics and Chemistry undergraduate intake was declining across the UK university sector as a whole, and outreach and public engagement were the exception rather than the rule. She has since acted as an advisor for museums, exam boards and educational committees. In 2010, Parker was listed by the Women in Science and Engineering (WISE) campaign as a 'female Brian Cox'. In 2014 Parker was awarded an honorary fellowship of the Institute of Physics for her contributions to physics education.  The Institute for Research in Schools  Parker's interest in school research began in 2007 during a school trip to CERN, when her students were inspired to enter a Surrey Satellite Technology competition to design a space experiment. After many successful research projects in the Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys, Parker opened The Langton Star Centre. The Institute for Research in Schools, a national charitable organisation supporting students and teachers to engage in collaborative, authentic research across a range of scientific disciplines was officially launched in March 2016 by Parker. She realised during her own academic career that more school children should be involved in scientific research, with young people being given credit for how innovative and intelligent they are. What began as an astrophysics project, with school groups using the Faulkes Telescope to make their own astrophysical observations, became something much more elaborate. Today a flagship IRIS projected allows school students to collaborate with CERN (CERN @ School), supported by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council, the Institute of Physics and SEPnet. Dr Jonathan Eastwood of Imperial College London described a new style cosmic ray detector designed by school students as the \\"UK's latest space facility\\". To build the detector, Parker raised in excess of ¬£60,000, using initial funds from the British National Space Centre. NASA were so interested in the detector that they took several up to the International Space Station. Data were collected, analysed and processed by students who were sitting their GCSEs. \\"Genomic Decoders\\", launched in partnership with the Wellcome Genome Campus, focuses on the first ever annotation of the parasitic human whipworm genome. Since its launch, IRIS has expanded, with over 450 schools registered and several genuine research opportunities for school students. Since its launch, IRIS has since received considerable media attention, and acting as Director is Parker's full-time role. It was given as evidence for the 2017 House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee report on Science Communication and Engagement.

Background The long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Litchfield, pp. 1‚Äì7.Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 27‚Äì8.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. The 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. History 12-pounder RBL field gun The unit was raised in Dublin in December 1854 under the title of Dublin City Artillery Militia. The first commanding officer (CO), appointed on 17 November 1854, was Lieutenant-Colonel-Commandant the Hon. Robert French Handcock, son of Lord Castelmaine and a Half-pay RA Captain.Litchfield, p. 70.Army List, various dates.Burke's, 'Castelmaine'. At first the headquarters (HQ) was at Lucan, Dublin, transferring to Dublin City in 1861. Training of the Irish Militia was suspended in 1866. When training resumed in 1871 the acting CO following Handcock's death was Major Francis de Burgh, who was promoted to Lt-Col on 17 December that year.'De Burgh of Oldtown' at Ancestry.com. Longstanding officers of the unit continued to be promoted to the command: Lt-Col W.J.N. Magill on 31 August 1878, Lt-Col W.C. Dickenson on 18 November 1896, and Lt-Col William L. Smythe on 14 February 1903. RA gunners train with a 12-pounder. The Artillery Militia was reorganised into 11 divisions of garrison artillery in 1882, and the Dublin City unit became the 4th Brigade, North Irish Division, RA. When the North Irish Division was abolished in 1889 the title was altered to Dublin City Artillery (Southern Division) RA.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 63‚Äì4. In 1898 the unit was reorganised, with three companies becoming field artillery batteries armed with 12-pounder RBL guns, the other two companies becoming 'position artillery' (semi-mobile heavy field artillery) armed with 40-pounder RBL guns. From 1902 most units of the Militia artillery formally became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery, the Dublin unit taking the title of 'Dublin City RGA (M). Embodiments Volunteers train with a 40-pounder. The unit was embodied for home defence three times: * Crimean War: February 1855 to September 1856 * Indian Mutiny: 2 April 1859 to 29 November 1860.

Edinburgh Gazette, 4 December 1860. * Second Boer War: 9 May to 6 November 1900 Disbandment After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of Militia Artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi- professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although the majority of the officers and men of the Dublin City RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, all these units were disbanded in March 1909.Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7.Litchfield, Appendix 8.

Especially wearing the right shoe before the left. Origin The Talmud, tractate Shabbat, quotes Johanan bar Nappaha who said one should wear the left shoe first. On the other hand, a Baraita says one should wear the right shoe first. Rav Yosef b. Hiyya said that since there is a source for every option, they are both fine. Rav Kahana II also didn't care which shoe is worn first. On the other hand, Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak said a Hasid should combine the options: enter the right shoe first, then the left and then tie the left shoe first and then the right. That was also the Minhag of Mar Bar Ravina. The Minhag of Mar Bar Ravina was quoted in the Halakha prominent book Shulchan Aruch: \\"One should put his right shoe on first and the left shoe last. Only after putting on the left shoe should one begin tying the shoe laces. First tie the left shoe and then the right one.\\" Other activities with right precedence appear in a Baraita in the Talmud: \\"When one puts on his shoes, he must put on the right first and then the left; when he removes [them], he must remove the left [first] and then the right. When one washes, he must [first] wash the right [hand, foot] and then the left. When one anoints [himself] with oil, he must anoint the right and then the left.\\" The precedence of the right in hand washing and using lotion were brought to Halakha by Avraham Gombiner and in the book Mishnah Berurah by Israel Meir Kagan. Moses Isserles wrote he didn't see people do so.Darkhei Moshe Orach Chaim, chapter 2 Avraham Gombiner, based on Isaac Luria books, added: \\"One should put both sides of the cloth on his right hand and wear the right side and then the left and have Kavanah that everything included in the idea of right and from the right comes to the left.\\" He was later quoted by Israel Meir Kagan and Yaakov Chaim Sofer,On their commentaries, Mishnah Berurah and Kaf Hachayim respectively, on the same chapter of Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 2) The Hebrew source of Mishna Berurah, Wikisource but while Kagan wrote it is a good thing to do, Sofer wrote it is a thing to be careful about.

The Bawaria gang was involved in crimes in multiple states. They were also called as the Lorry Gang.  History  The operation was launched by Tamil Nadu Police in January 2005 soon after the murder of AIADMK Gummidipoondi MLA Sudarsanam when armed dacoits struck affluent houses surrounding the National Highway in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Bawaria was the prime suspect in dacoities in which many prominent figures including Salem district Congress committee president Thalamuthu Natarajan and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam functionary Gajendran, were killed. The modus operandi was to target affluent families while transporting goods from north to south in trucks. After unloading the goods, they would strike at the houses and resort to \\"unprovoked\\" violence, causing fatal injuries. In Sriperumbudur, they killed a schoolgirl and injured her parents grievously while committing a dacoity. Bawaria was wanted by the police in nine States for his involvement in about 200 major dacoity cases. One of his recent operations was at Gummidipoondi where AIADMK MLA Sudarsanam, was shot dead and his house looted. = Investigation = The operation against the Bawaria criminals was launched in January 2005 soon after the murder of AIADMK MLA K. Sudarsanam from Gummidipoondi. When armed dacoits struck affluent houses along National Highways in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister of Tamilnadu, Jayalalithaa ordered intensive action against the culprits. Director General of Police S. R. Jangid along with Additional Director General of Police Sanjay Arora led a team to investigate. Soon after the start of the investigation, the team were able to match the fingerprints with the modus operandi of the gang. They speculated that the murders were carried out by a same group in different parts of India. The team coordinated with the Uttar Pradesh Police and central intelligence agencies. = Arrest = Following specific information, The team raided a house in Kannauj in the early hours. With reinforcement from the U.P. Special Task Force, they nabbed Bawaria and his wife Beena Devi as they were preparing for a major dacoity nearby. Though the accused resisted, the police overpowered the couple and took them into custody. Police sources said the duo was taken to an unknown destination for interrogation. Beginning in January 2005, the team nabbed ten Bawaria gang members in various parts of the country along with four trucks used by them. After their arrest, no dacoity cases were logged in the northern districts. Over the course of the next eight years, the team hunted down the criminals and finally they found the remaining gang members in Rajasthan.  In popular culture  In 2017, H. Vinoth directed Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru, a Tamil film based on S. R. Jangid and this case.

Released in October 2016, Faces to the Sun is a double album with more than a dozen featured artists. The first disc comprises renditions of major South African pop songs. Lead singer Claire Johnston described the selections as \\"personal favourites of ours\\" that are about what it means to be South African. The second disc features eight original songs, plus a remix of Mango Groove's cover of \\"Durban Road\\" (a song first released by the Makhona Zonke Band in 1975). Four songs from the album were released as singles: \\"Faces to the Sun\\" was issued as a digital single in October 2015; music videos for \\"From the Get Go\\" and \\"Another Country\\" premiered in November 2016; a music video for \\"Kind\\" followed in February 2017, and one for \\"Under African Skies\\" in July 2018. Production Lead singer Claire Johnston conceived the album circa 2011. Several years after the release of Africa Blue, her 2004 cover album of jazz and R&B; classics, Johnston was contemplating the production of a third solo album to cover \\"great South African songs\\". The idea evolved into a Mango Groove project. Around the same time, Johnston and bandleader John Leyden divorced, and Johnston's mother died. \\"It was a turbulent time but a lot of that energy fed into the album and made it an emotional final product,\\" Johnston said. The album was recorded, arranged, and produced by bandmembers Andrew Baird and John Leyden at Orangotang Studios in the Sandton suburb of Bryanston. Before emigrating to South Africa from Zimbabwe, Baird had specialised in producing gospel and inspirational music. On 5 October 2015, the band released the first single: \\"Faces to the Sun\\". At that time, the album was to be titled Sing the Beloved Country, with a release planned for March 2016. In early October 2016, just over a year after the first single, press releases from the band and their label announced a revised release date, along with the track list and the new album title. Warner Music South Africa released the retitled double album via the iTunes Store on 28 October 2016; the CD release followed a week later, on 11 November. Photography for Faces to the Sun is by Graeme Wyllie, with graphic design by the Red Flag agency of Johannesburg. \\"The Road\\", the final song on the album, is dedicated to the memory of Nelson Mandela, who died in 2013. =Artist collaborations= Shortly before the album's release, bandleader John Leyden commented on the musical collaborations: \\"We chose iconic South African artists that have been part of our own musical journey and whose amazing voices suited our interpretations of the songs, but at the same time, we also worked with a couple of new and exciting contemporary artists\\". One of the featured collaborators is trumpeter and house music artist Mo T (Moshe Kgasoane); he is the son of the band's longtime trumpeter, Banza Kgasoane, who died in 2015. Zolani Mahola (lead singer of Freshlyground) sings with Mango in a new recording of \\"Another Country\\", the title song of the 1993 album Another Country. It was an anthem that helped usher South Africa out of the apartheid regime and into a new government. Other featured artists include Afrikaans singers Juanita du Plessis and Kurt Darren; folk singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela; gospel singer Rebecca Malope; and vocal quartet Romanz. Reception In 2017, Faces to the Sun was a South African Music Awards nominee in the \\"Best Adult Contemporary Album\\" and \\"Best Engineered Album\\" categories (the engineer was Andrew Baird). The award for \\"Best Adult Contemporary Album\\" went to Hugh Masekela's No Borders; the award for Best Engineered Album went to Arno Carstens' Aandblom 13.

This was the first coastal steam packet in the United States. The steamer was also the first of the Charles Morgan Line. Columbia could run on wind or steam power, holding one mast both fore and aft of its side paddlewheels and its single smoke stack. New York and Charleston packet Columbia first ran as a coastal steam packet, with service terminating at New York City and Charleston, South Carolina. Its owner, New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company, was a partnership established in June 1834 between James P. Allaire, John Haggerty, and Charles Morgan. Morgan had already established himself as a shipping agent and chandlery merchant out of his office in New York. In 1833, he divested of his chandlery in order to focus on managing his steam packet concerns. On 21 March 1835, New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company acquired the Columbia. This was one of several steamers which serviced a lucrative contract to carry United States Mail between New York and Charleston.Baughman (1968), pp. 1220. In October 1837, New York and Charleston Steam Packet Company suffered a great loss with the deadly and financially costly sinking of its newest steamship, the Home. This catastrophe prompted a reorganization of the company, leaving Morgan in control of operations, with Haggerty as the only remaining partner. While there is some scant evidence that ‚Äò‚ÄôColumbia‚Äô‚Äô had been dispatched for a trial run for Gulf Coast service early as 1835, Columbia made its first packet run between New Orleans and Galveston, Texas on 25 November 1837. New Orleans and Galveston packet This reorganized partnership then consisting of just Morgan and Haggerty is considered the beginning of the Charles Morgan Line, with Columbia known as its first ship. James Reed & Company, Columbia's agent in New Orleans, purchased shares in the steamer, even briefly owning a majority interest before liquidating on 31 October 1838. In early 1838, Columbia made a dozen runs between Galveston and Velasco, Texas, a town at the mouth of the Brazos River. At that time, the owners of the steamship Columbia formed a cartel with the owners of the steamship Cuba, an arrangement known to the public as the New Orleans and Texas Line. These arrangements included coordination of scheduling, rates, and freight. The New Orleans and Texas Line dominated this steamship market for a few years.Baughman (1968), pp. 2228. Columbia offered three classes of passenger travel: accommodations on deck, in the standard cabin, or in the main cabin, which was described in the journal of Mary Austin Holley, a distant relative of Stephen F. Austin. She described fine linens, silver and ivory utensils, and service from a \\"French cook\\" and a \\"lady-like chamber maid.\\" During this time, the steamer was configured to accommodate sixty passengers, split between the cabin and the deck. The Columbia normally completed the New Orleans to Galveston route within a range of 35 to 40 hours, but had run its best time in 33 hours. These speeds easily exceeded the performance of sailing vessels. Columbia had two sources of power: steam and sail. Steam power propelled the ship when the wind was not favorable in terms of strength or direction. This was critical while navigating the Mississippi River below New Orleans and the narrow coastal passes near Galveston. Steam power allowed travel along a straight line. Most of the freight manifests listed personal effects. Columbia transported most of its heavy freight to the port of Galveston from New Orleans, though it also hauled cotton and hides out of Texas. In the first few months of 1838, Columbia earned over $12,000 in profit. Columbia ran this route exclusively for about four months in 1839 after Cuba ran aground east of Galveston Island. Columbia departed New Orleans twice monthly, on the first and the fifteenth, and departed Galveston on the eighth and twenty-second. However, a rival dispatched its own steamer Neptune to run this route, breaking Morgan's exclusive service on the Texas Gulf Coast on 7 November 1839. The competition did not persist there long, and soon, Morgan's fleet regained its monopoly with its Columbia and the New York, which had been moved from the Atlantic. In January 1840, however, the Morgan and Haggerty partnership sold Columbia to Henry Windle.Baughman (1968), pp. 3335.

This approach would reduce the paperwork burden for applicants and create a clearer timeline for a final decision. Eliminating ambiguity would help de novo banks project startup costs and timing, which is critical for companies raising capital and kicking off a new business. At the same time, the suggestion preserves the FDIC's veto power if it has reason to differ substantively with the judgment of the primary regulator.Testimony of Keith A.

Thresholds such as these become barriers to competition and can serve to protect the largest institutions, according to Noreika.Keith A. Noreika. Remarks Before the Midsize Bank Coalition of America.

He suggested policy makers should reexamine the reasons for maintaining the separation of banking and commerce to determine whether it still makes sense for banks, businesses, and the economy today. In a speech before The Clearing House on November 8, 2017, he pointed out that the United States is unusual in maintaining a separation between banking and commerce. He suggested that by allowing banking and commerce to mix, small banks could access more diverse sources of capital and consumers could benefit from increased choice and greater competition among financial service providers.Keith A.

Bank Holding Companies and the Bank Holding Company Act While at the OCC, Noreika raised questions regarding the continued usefulness of the Bank Holding Company Act and whether bank holding companies had become obsolete.

Biography Shatrov was born in Zemlyansk, Semilukskiy, Voronezh Oblast, Russia on 1 April 1879 to Aleksej Mihajlovich Shatrov, a retired non-commissioned officer of the Lithuanian Life Guards Infantry Regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard. In 1905, Shutrov became the bandmaster of the Mokshansky Regimental Orchestra and served in the Russo- Japanese war. In February 1905, the 214th Reserve Mokshan Infantry Regiment took part in the Battle of Mukden and Liaoyang . In one of the battles the regiment was surrounded by the Japanese and was constantly attacked by the enemy. At a critical moment, when the ammunition was already spent, the regiment commander Colonel Pavel Pobyvanets gave the order: \\"The banner and the orchestra will go ahead!\\" Kapellmeister Shatrov led the orchestra to the parapet of the trenches, gave the order to play a battle march and led the orchestra ahead of the regiment's banner. Encouraged soldiers rushed into the bayonet attack. During the battle, the regiment, with the music of the orchestra, continuously attacked the Japanese and, in the end, broke through the encirclement. In the course of the battle the regiment commander perished, and of the original 4000 members of the regiment only 700 people, including 7 musicians of the orchestra, were left alive. For this feat, all the musicians of the orchestra were awarded with crosses of St. George, Shatrov - an officer order of Saint Stanislav 3rd class with swords (the second such awarding of the conductors), and the orchestra was awarded silver pipes. After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the Mokshan regiment remained for a whole year in Manchuria, where Ilya Alekseevich, once on the orders of the new regiment commander at the guardhouse, began to write the waltz ‚ÄúMoksha Regiment on the Hills of Manchuria‚Äù, dedicated to the dead comrades. At first, the audience rather coolly met this waltz, but a year later gramophone records with his recordings became very popular. First published in 1907, waltz sheet music was reprinted 82 times by 1911. After 1911, the name of the waltz was reduced, it began to be called \\"On the hills of Manchuria\\" [1]. Having fallen in love with a young girl, Alexander Shikhobalov, Shatrov wrote the waltz ‚ÄúCountry Dreams‚Äù, which also became very successful. In 1910, the beloved died, the regiment was disbanded, and in such a difficult situation Shatrov wrote a new composition - ‚ÄúAutumn has arrived‚Äù to the words of J. Prigogee. The huge popularity of the waltz ‚ÄúOn the hills of Manchuria‚Äù showed Shatrov that as the author of the melody, he was deprived of income. In addition, a man appeared who claimed that he was not Shatrov, but that he was the real author of the waltz. He also tried to bring Shatrov to trial, but this attempt failed. At that time, companies that released phonograph records paid a one-time fee to the author, and then released as many copies of music as they liked. Only with the adoption in 1911 of the first copyright law in Russia in relation to gramophone recording, did the authors have the opportunity to protect their interests, and Shatrov was not slow to take advantage of this. Lawsuits have been filed against a number of companies. The result of this campaign was that most of the companies began to produce records with pasted copyright stamps, and the Sirena Record company lost the lawsuit to the author of the waltz ‚ÄúOn the Fells of Manchuria‚Äù and was forced to pay him a royalty in the amount of 15 kopecks from each record sold. After the revolution he joined the Red Army, was the bandmaster of the Red Cavalry Brigade. After the end of the Civil War until 1935, he served in Pavlograd. From 1935 to 1938 he directed the orchestra of the Tambov Cavalry School, in 1938 he was discharged and remained to work in Tambov. In 1943 he returned to the army and served as the bandmaster of the division. He finished the war with two medals and the Order of the Red Star. After the war, he directed the Kirovabad Garrison Orchestra in the Transcaucasian Military District (military band of the Transcaucasian Military District). He resigned in 1951, returned to Tambov, where he was in charge of the music department at the Tambov Suvorov School. He died in Tambov on 2 May 1952. He was buried at Vozdvizhensky Cemetery.

The gesture is usually performed by looking at someone out of the corners of one's eyes, then turning the eyes away quickly down towards the foot opposite the eye of the person the gesture is being performed at. The main focus of this gesture is the \\"cut\\" of the eyes, and can be performed by moving them in one direction or several sharp up and down movements, meant to convey a feeling of anger or disapproval.\\"Cut-Eye and Suck-Teeth: African Words and Gestures in New World Guise\\" http://www.johnrickford.com/portals/45/documents/papers/Rickford-1976b-Cut- Eye-and-Suck-Teeth.pdf This gesture has evolved into popular culture and has taken on new monikers while remaining similar to the original African gesture. The cut-eye gesture now is also identified with: stink-eye, evil-look, eye- roll, or death stare.Alim, H. Samy, et al. \\"\\"Whatever (Neck Roll, Eye Roll, Teeth Suck)\\": The Situated Coproduction of Social Categories and Identities through Stancetaking and Transmodal Stylization.\\" Journal of Linguistic Anthropology., vol. 20, no. 1, 2010, pp. 179‚Äì194. The gesture also is similar in nature to the evil-eye gesture of the Christian and Islamic theologies.Idoyaga Molina, Anatilde. \\"The Evil Eye as a Folk Disease and Its Argentine and Ibero-American Historical Explanatory Frame.\\" Western Folklore, vol. 75, no. 1, 2016, pp. 5‚Äì32.Elliott, John H., and John H Elliott.

ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/northeastern- ebooks/detail.action?docID=4534319. Uses The action of performing cut-eye is commonly associated with the suck-teeth gesture and a neck roll for maximum effect. In media depictions, the people who perform the neck roll are usually also portrayed as loud, tough, argumentative, and even combative. Cut-eye is used primarily to depict power over another person who has done something wrong or to the user's displeasure. The use of the cut-eye gesture is meant to send a feeling of anger or disgust without verbally communicating the same sentiment. The cut-eye gesture can be done with or without the knowledge of the recipient and has different meanings in each context. When done directly to the recipient of the gesture, the cut-eye conveys direct anger, disappointment, and disapproval. When done without the knowledge of the recipient, the cut-eye gesture can convey the same message but with the desire to have the sentiment remain unknown due to fear of the recipient or general lack of desire to verbally or blatantly portray anger. Cut-eye makes its full effect when the eyes of the person performing the gesture are turned the opposite direction from the person to which it is intended for. This sends the message that they aren't worth the attention. The gesture is used in many cases, most typically when a person is talking and is interrupted by another individual. In this case, a sharp cut-eye is given in order to show the level of anger and disrespect felt by the user. In addition, it shows the perceived irrelevancy of the individual who interrupted. It also gives the person to which the gesture is intended the same feeling of disrespect of anger the user of the gesture felt. By \\"rummaging\\" one's eyes over a person, one violates their personal space and sense of confidence. The victim cannot do anything in this situation to prevent this violation.  Origins  = Africa = In Africa, the origin of the cut-eye gesture is the region in and around the modern-day countries of Ghana and Nigeria, and other nations that were once part of the Ghanaian Empire. In this region, the gesture began as a show of anger and conflict between two individuals and could be used with the intent of the onset of combat or without said intent. The gesture was serious in nature and remain the origin of the cut-eye in Ghanaian Empire is the most direct to the gesture of popular culture. = Europe and the Middle East = In Europe, the origin of the cut-eye gesture is centered around the gesture of evil-eye in the context of its biblical references. The original form in Europe and the Middle East was far more serious than the nature of the gesture in the African setting as in the theologies of Europe and the Middle East, the gesture was believed to carry a supernatural power. In the Eurasian context, the cut-eye or evil-eye gesture would bring bad omens upon the recipient and was believed to bring sickness, curses, and possibly death; as a result the use of the evil-eye gesture could often lead to banishment or Eurasian version of the gesture is most represented in modern culture by the potential offense upon receiving the cut-eye, but also shows in the large range of severity the gesture can carry. Translations The visual gesture of cut-eye is found in many Ghanaian languages, including translations in Akan, Ga, and Ewe. * Akan ‚Äì anikyibuo / anikyie 'the art of breaking the back of the eye' * Ga ‚Äì o-kp√¢-mi 'you cut-eye me' * Ewe ‚Äì tre√•ku 'seal eyes'Identity Meets Nationality : Voices from the Humanities, edited by Helen Lauer, and Jemima Asabea Anderson, Sub- Saharan Publishers, 2010.

Twin Peaks recorded the bulk of the album in August 2015 with R. Andrew Humphrey co-producing. This is the band's first album to feature keyboardist and guitarist Colin Croom, who joined prior to the recording of the album.  Reception  Down in Heaven received generally positive reviews from music critics. Grant Rindner of The Line of Best Fit said, \\"The band has always walked a delicate line between thoughtful, psychedelic pop and rollicking power chords, and they've perfected this balancing act on Down in Heaven... With their third album, Twin Peaks have become not just one of the most exciting young bands in the Chicago music scene, but in the entire rock landscape.\\" Othe critics noted the band's move towards songs of a slower tempo. Stuart Berman of Pitchfork described the album as \\"a casual, charmingly low-key set of kitchen-table blues, slow-dance serenades, and unplugged power pop. Here, Twin Peaks aren't so interested in being the life of party as documenting what happens outside of it: the awkward first kisses, the difficult break-up conversations, the sad walks home alone.\\" Adrien Begrand of Spin stated that it's \\"satisfying to hear young rock bands with rich knowledge of the genre's history, trying their damnedest to capture the energy of old records from a bygone era\\" and said, \\"The unhinged energy of [Wild Onion] has been toned down in favor of a more sedate approach, and although that immediate, primal energy is missed upon initial listens, the more relaxed approach fits rather well... This young band's musical growth supersedes the album's imperfections, and hopefully Down in Heaven will eventually be regarded as a transition to something more career-defining.\\"  Track listing   Personnel  Twin Peaks * Connor Brodner ‚Äì drums * Colin Croom ‚Äì lead vocals , keyboards, guitar * Jack Dolan ‚Äì lead vocals , bass guitar * Clay Frankel ‚Äì lead vocals , guitar * Cadien Lake James ‚Äì lead vocals , guitar Additional musicians * Kevin Decker ‚Äì baritone saxophone * Will Miller ‚Äì trumpet * Irvine Pierce ‚Äì tenor saxophone Production * John Agnello ‚Äì mixing * Greg Calbi ‚Äì mastering * R.

She has founded international organizations (European Association of Science Editors; International Federation of Science Editors), conferences (International Conference of Scientific Editors) and journals (Desalination, editor 1966-2009; Desalination and Water Treatment, editor 2009-; Symbiosis 1985-) and has edited numerous journals, conference proceedings and books. She also publishes the Desalination Directory, an international online database. Balaban was a research associate for science communication at Boston University from 1975 to 2008. She became secretary general of the organizing committee of the International Federation of Scientific Editors‚Äô Associations (IFSEA) in 1978, and the founder and first president of its successor organization, the International Federation of Science Editors (IFSE) in 1990. She was Professor and founding Dean of the School for Science Communication at the Mario Negri Sud Institute for Biomedical and Pharmacological Research in Italy from 1988 to 1992. She has been the Secretary General of the European Desalination Society (EDS) since 1993. Among other awards, Balaban received the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity from the President of Italy in 2012. Early life Miriam Balaban was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and graduated from the Philadelphia High School for Girls in 1945. She attended the University of Pennsylvania where she graduated with a B. Sc. degree in chemistry in 1949. Science communication Soon after graduating, Balaban moved to Jerusalem where she found work editing the quarterly scientific bulletin of the Government Research Council. The first volume of the Bulletin of the Research Council of Israel was published by Balaban in both English and Hebrew. Under her direction, publication of the bulletin was greatly expanded, eventually splitting into five separate publications focusing on various areas of science, published through the Weizmann Science Press. In 1958, Balaban established the Israel Program for Scientific Translation, contracting with the United States National Science Foundation to fund the translation of foreign language publications. In the United States, the Council of Biology Editors (CBE), later the Council of Science Editors (CSE), was formed in 1957 following discussions at the Conference of Biological Editors in New Orleans. CBE had the support of the National Science Foundation and the American Institute of Biological Sciences. In 1960, the organization published its first Style Manual for Biological Journals. At the 1964 CBE conference in Ann Arbor, Michigan, a special meeting was held for both American and European editors. This inspired the formation of similar organizations in Europe. Miriam Balaban helped to start the European Association of Editors of Biological Periodicals (EAEBP). EAEBP was formed in April 1967 in Amsterdam, and renamed European Life Science Editors (ELSE) at its first General Assembly, held at the Royal Society in London in 1970. In 1982, ELSE joined with the European Association of Earth Science Editors (Editerra) to form the European Association of Science Editors (EASE). Balaban served multiple terms as treasurer of the organization. Concerns of the organization included the development of international standards for science journals, guidelines for authors whose first language was not English, republishing of articles in multiple languages, and the improvement of science communication generally. From 1975 to 2008, Balaban was a research associate at the Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University, focusing on science communication. In 1977-1978 Balaban helped to found the International Federation of Scientific Editors‚Äô Associations (IFSEA). The idea for such an organization was put forward at the First International Conference of Scientific Editors, April 24‚Äì29, 1977, which Balaban organized. The idea was further discussed at a UNESCO-supported consultation meeting, chaired by Balaban, which was held June 5‚Äì6, 1978 in Paris, France. The formation of IFSEA was agreed upon and Balaban was named to the organizing committee as Secretary-General. Balaban organized 12 international conferences for scientific editors, beginning in 1977 with the first International Conference of Scientific Editors in Jerusalem. In 1990, IFSEA opened its membership to individuals as well as associations, and became IFSE, the International Federation of Science Editors (variously the International Federation of Scientific Editors), with Balaban as its founder and first president. Balaban is president, publisher and editor of the scientific publishing house International Science Services. Based in Rehovot, Israel and L‚ÄôAquila, Italy. ISS publishes in a variety of scientific disciplines. Balaban has supported the development of journals both within and outside her own field. In 1985, she worked with lichenologist Margalith Galun to create the journal Symbiosis. The first 48 issues were published by Balaban International Science Services. From October 2009 onwards, the journal has been published by Springer. She established the School for Science Communication at the Mario Negri Sud Institute for Biomedical and Pharmacological Research in Italy where she served as Professor and Dean from 1988 to 1992. Desalination The focus of Balaban's research career has been desalination. In 1966, Balaban founded Desalination, the first international journal for desalting and purification of water, serving as its editor-in-chief from 1996 to 2009. She was succeeded as editor by Nidal Hilal. In 2009 Balaban established and became editor-in- chief of the monthly Desalination and Water Treatment Journal, to accommodate the expanding field. She has reviewed and edited more than 20,000 papers and several books from over 100 countries. She is the editor and publisher of the Desalination Directory. The international online database connects over 30,000 individuals and 5,000 academic and government institutions and companies involved in desalination and water conservation. Balaban has been a member of the International Desalination Association since 1975 and has served as a board member and officer. She is a member of the Scientific Program Committee for the International Desalination Workshop. Since 1993, Balaban has been the Secretary General of the European Desalination Society (EDS), located at the Universit√† Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy. Balaban organizes international courses, conferences and workshops in desalination, traveling and speaking internationally. She has been referred to as \\"the soul of the European Desalination Society\\". In her position with the EDS, she served on the Committee to Review the Desalination and Water Purification Technology Roadmap, a document prepared by Sandia National Laboratories and the U.S. Department of Interior in 2003. The committee's review was published by the National Research Council and the National Academy of Sciences in 2004. It recommended that a more critical focus be taken, examining the steps needed to reach desired long-term objectives and the environmental, economic, and social costs. Balaban is involved with the desalination program at the Center for Clean Water and Energy in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She is on the Scientific Advisory Council of the Sharing Knowledge Foundation.

She became known as the \\"Flower of the University (of Nari√±o)\\" (). Biography Adriana Ben√≠tez was born on 31 October 1975 the third of five sisters in San Rafael Hospital, Pasto, Colombia. After she graduated high school, she entered the University of Nari√±o to study economics. At 18, she had a child and was obliged to enter the workforce to pay for her tuition and family, which was difficult because of low wages. In this environment, she became a socialist and began meeting and working with local women to at first procure items for families and then improved working conditions, rights, and benefits. At the University-level, she founded the student group Radicales Libres and led student demonstrations against the and organized the Departmental Forum Against the Colombia Plan. She also advocated for the reduction of motor vehicles in Pasto and organized protests against Plan Colombia. Murder On 14 October 2000, Ben√≠tez and fellow student Mart√≠n Emilio Rodr√≠guez were shot dead on the Plaza de Nari√±o in Pasto by Guillermo P√©rez Alzate, alias \\"Pablo Sevillano,\\" a United Self- Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) gunman acting on the orders of Carlos Casta√±o Gil while she was meeting with local women. The motive for the shooting was that she had \\"worked with FARC in the El Cagu√°n DMZ.\\" While exiting a restaurant, P√©rez and an accomplice exited a red van and shot Ben√≠tez and Rodr√≠guez in the back and then fled to the other side of the square to re- enter the van and escape. Ben√≠tez's murder came at a time when the organized student body at the University of Nari√±o had been strengthened by their demonstrations in 1998 and 1999 against the government of Andr√©s Pastrana Arango.

Strudwick was born in Fulham, the daughter of John and Harriet Strudwick, her father being a prominent Pre-Raphaelite artist. She was educated at Queen Elizabeth's School in West Kensington, then won a scholarship to Bedford College, London (now Royal Holloway, University of London), where she completed an honours degree in classics. She became a schoolteacher, teaching classics at the Laurels School in Rugby, but soon returned to Bedford College. There, she completed an MA, and taught classics, before becoming head of its Latin department. Strudwick left the college in 1913, when she was appointed as headteacher of the City of London School for Girls. She ran the school through World War I, and after the war expanded the school's curriculum by building a physics laboratory, and encouraging pupils to undertake social work in south London. In 1921, she was also appointed to the Senate of the University of London. In 1927, Strudwick beat 45 other candidates to be appointed as headteacher of St Paul's Girls' School. At the school, she again ordered more teaching space to be built for science, and she also taught some classes herself. During World War II, she arranged for the evacuation of many pupils to Wycombe Abbey School, but in May 1940, parents voted for the school to return to London. Despite the war, pupil numbers increased. During this period, Angela Brazil wrote a children's story set at the school; Strudwick strongly disapproved, denouncing the book in morning prayers, then collecting copies of the book from pupils to be burned. Strudwick became increasingly involved with national bodies, serving as president of the Association of Headmistresses from 1931 to 1933, founding president of the British Federation of Business and Professional Women in 1937, and joined the council of the Girls' Public Day School Trust in 1948. In 1945, she sat on a government committee of inquiry into the future role of women in the foreign service, chosen because she was known not to hold strongly feminist views. In 1943, she was elected to the national council of the Liberal Party, and she was president of the Women's Liberal Federation for a year from 1949. Strudwick was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1936, and a Commander in 1948. She retired that year.

Walverden Water is a minor river in Lancashire, England. It is approximately long and has a catchment area of . Course Beginning at Walverden Reservoir, which is fed by Catlow Brook (from the Coldwell Reservoirs near Boulsworth Hill) and its tributaries, the river heads northwest into the town of Nelson. It flows under Scholefield Mill, where it is presumably still met by Clough Head Beck, and continues on through Walverden Park. Shortly afterwards it enters a series of culverts as it passes through the town centre and under the East Lancashire railway line viaduct and the A56 Leeds Road bridge, emerging at Bradley Road and collecting Bradley Syke. It turns to the north and then west and is again culverted, before entering a tunnel under the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and junction 13 of the M65 motorway, emerging next to Nelson and Colne College and shortly after flowing into Pendle Water. History The name possibly originates from a contraction of the Old English words (stream) and (frith), with (valley). Water (OE ) is a common name for a stream, most often found in southern Scotland.Ekwall, p20. Walverden Water anciently formed the boundary between the manor of Ightenhill and the manor of Colne, also dividing what was then the township of Marsden in two, with Great Marsden to the northeast and Little Marsden on the southwest side. The lord of Clitheroe had a mill on the river in 1311, thought to have been sited near the confluence with Clough Head Beck, and there is also evidence of an ancient fulling mill close to the reservoir. Duchy of Lancaster records show that Richard Towneley of Towneley Hall was prevented from operating a corn mill called Walveden Mill in 1482 (as was his son John in 1495) as it caused a loss to the king's mills at Burnley and Colne. The first Ordnance Survey map of the area, published in 1848, shows a corn mill with a pond at what was still the small village of Bradley (today the centre of town). Also a little further north, a sluice appears to feed a mill race to a small pond, across the canal at Hodge Bank, the only cotton mill visible, located next to Reedyford House. By the time Nelson developed into a mill town water-power had given way to the steam engine, however these still required a good supply of water. Walverden Mill (built before 1850), Victoria Mill (1857) and Vale Street Shed (1867) were constructed at sites next to the river in the decades that followed. Although the act that authorised the creation of a compensation reservoir passed in 1866, construction was delayed as all the tenders exceeded the budget of ¬£3196. It was competed by 1869, under the direct management of the local board with a capacity of . Consequently, several more cotton mills were built along the river, including: Brook Street Mills (by 1884), Bradley Shed (by 1890), Clover Mill (by 1909), Marsden Mill (by 1909), Scholefield Mill (by 1910) and the Valley Mills (first three built between 1895‚Äì1910, No.4 in 1930). As was the Premier Dye Works, which operated from before 1909 until 1963, with the river also vital for its water supply. In 2010 United Utilities was fined after a blockage caused sewage to leak into the river through a storm overflow for four days in June, causing \\"a significant amount of pollution that had a serious impact on water quality\\". A year-long, Environment Agency led flood- alleviation scheme in the town-centre, completed in 2011, included raising the existing flood walls, the removal of an old weir and sluice and repairs to the walls and culverts with some of the underground sections opened up.

The game was launched worldwide on March 28, 2018, and is primarily set in the Marvel Universe. Premise The Earth has fallen under siege by sinister forces led by Ultimus. Agents of S.T.R.I.K.E. (Special Tactical Reserve for Interdimensional Key Events) have been called to assemble squads of heroes and villains to combat Ultimus's legions, that includes mind-controlled versions of the heroes and villains, before Earth falls under Ultimus' control. In addition to this campaign, special sub-plot events are also released, loosely based on recent Marvel films that have been released, starting with Avengers: Infinity War.  Gameplay  Marvel Strike Force allows players to collect Marvel Universe characters from both the heroes and villains and generic characters from large organizations such as SHIELD, The Hand and Hydra, and use them to fight in turn-based battles. There are multiple ways to collect characters: some are given to players immediately, whereas others are gained via gameplay or as in- game rewards in the form of shards that are earned by players to unlock and or promote their characters. Shards can either be earned from winning battles or bought from a shop. Players level up their user level by gaining experience by completing daily quests or completing battles. Battles are divided up into rounds, with the character with the highest speed attribute going first. Each team consists of up to five characters (though some AI teams in raids can have far more characters than that) who battle until defeated or reinforcements enter. Battles are turn-based, based on the speed attribute, where the combatants apply healing and various buffs to their own team and damage and debuffs to the opponent all the while trying to deal the most overall damage and having the last character alive. Players may join alliances that form the main group inside of the game, which can include up to 24 players and be private or open. Alliances allow players to play in raids and wars and to access alliance milestones. These alliances can be created by any player or created by the game. All players must be in an alliance, so if a player leaves or is kicked from an alliance, the game will assign a new one.  Modes  The main game modes are Arena, Blitz, Raids, Challenges and Alliance War. Each of these modes has its own currency that can be spent on character shards or items. All modes are played versus a computer controlled AI, including the arena and alliance war battles where the AI controls a player-created team. Arena is battling against other player created squads in 5-on-5 battles while competing for daily prizes based on ranking at the end of the daily reset time. Raids are a series of maps that a player-ran alliance of up to 24 people must work together to defeat all of the nodes. Challenges are completed once a day to allow players to accumulate various resources. Each challenge occurs three days per week and can be completed three times per day. Challenge requires specific character traits to be used to complete each tier of the challenge. Alliance War is working together within a player's alliance to defeat an opponent's helicarrier with 12 rooms each with two sets of 8 defense teams while defending with the player's own helicarrier. Versus battle is a one versus one battle between two players played in real time.

It occurs because of neuroendocrine dysfunction and is usually reversible. Exercise amenorrhoea is a component of female athlete triad. Etiology Exercise induced amenorrhoea occurs in 5-25% of athletes and 1.8% of the general population. The incidence is higher in marathon runners and is more frequent in women who weigh less and were slightly younger. Exercise amenorrhoea has also been reported in ballet dancers, cyclists, swimmers and those involved in non-weight bearing sports. Pathophysiology There occurs a suppression in the generation of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). The secretion of GnRH normally occurs in a pulsatile fashion, every 60 to 90 minutes. This is absent in exercise amenorrhoea. The function of GnRH is to stimulate the secretion of leutinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). As a result, LH and to a certain extent FSH are secreted in low quantities. These hormones are necessary for normal menstruation, and result in amenorrhoea if not secreted in adequate quantities. Diagnosis Exercise amenorrhoea is a diagnosis of exclusion. Girls who exercise at a young age may have primary amenorrhoea. The differential diagnosis are androgen excess, pituitary tumors (rare), tumors of the third ventricle (rare) or other conditions leading to chronic malnutrition. Diet history and bone density investigations should also be done to determine if female athlete triad is present. Management Exercise amenorrhoea can be managed by eating a diet rich in calories and by decreasing the duration and intensity of exercise for at least 12 months. Amenorrhea usually persists and may take over 6 months to reverse.

After falling from favour during the reign of Antiochus I, Antiochus entered into the service of Ashoka, the Mauryan King, and wrote extensively about his exploration of the Indian Ocean. Born in Cyprus, his family moved to Macedonia at some point during the reign of Philip II. Little else is known about his early years until he is mentioned by Arrian (3.35.3) as a minor commander during Alexander the Great's siege of Tyre in 332. Since much of the remainder of Alexander's campaign was land-based, there was little opportunity for Antiochus to demonstrate his naval talents in battle; however, he was evidently highly regarded because he is mentioned by Arrian (7.1.17) as one of the leading commanders of the fleet led by Nearchus in 324. The sources for the early Hellenistic period are notoriously problematic and there are large gaps in our knowledge, so we cannot establish Antiochus' exact role in the years immediately after Alexander's death in 323. However, by 310 he was serving Seleucus I (Diodorus of Sicily 18.15.3) and later commanded the Seleucid fleet (Plutarch, Life of Demetrius 37.2). Despite serving Seleucus with distinction, winning victory against Ptolemy I at the Battle of Salamis in 306 BC, Antiochus fell from favour after the death of Seleucus in 281. Strabo (6.1.1) claims that Antiochus was the victim of a power struggle at court: Megasthenes, Seleucus' ambassador to India, alleged that Antiochus had misappropriated funds for the construction of four triremes. However, Herodotus (5.33) argues that it was Megasthenes himself who had stolen the money and that Antiochus was simply the scapegoat - without further evidence, the truth cannot be established. After losing his command, Antiochus falls from the historical record until he reappears as a naval commander at the court of Ashoka, the king of the Mauryan Empire in India (Arrian, Indica 2.34.1), likely sometime in the 260s. His precise role is unclear, but Athenaeus (12.155a-e) uses him as a source of information about spices from ancient Sri Lanka. This suggests that he was involved in exploring the coastline of India, but his writing survives only in fragments of later authors so this is not certain.

The Prime Minister said: \\"I can confirm that Benita Mehra wrote to me yesterday to offer her resignation from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry panel and I have accepted. I would like to thank Benita for her commitment and I am very grateful for her sensitivity to the work of the Inquiry. In her letter she had hoped to draw on her experience and knowledge of the construction industry, of community engagement and of governance within housing management contribute to the vital work of the Inquiry in discovering how and why the devastating fire at Grenfell Tower happened. However, it is apparent that her former role as President of the Women's Engineering Society(WES), which in 2017 accepted a charitable donation from the Arctic Charitable Foundation to support the mentoring of women engineers and apprentices, has caused serious concerns to a number of the bereaved, survivors and resident Core Participants. Within her letter to the Prime Minister she made it quite clear she had not had any contact with either the Arconic Charitable Foundation or Arconic and her involvement in the donation was to review the initial proposal. As President of WES, her role was unpaid and the grant from the Arconic Charitable Foundation was ring-fenced to fund the mentoring scheme alone, and for these reasons, she did not link any aspect of her former role as President to the panel member for the Grenfell Tower Inquiry. She did not feel to cause any further distress to those who had already suffered such unimaginable losses and trauma, nor to create any distractions from the vital work of the public inquiry and felt no option but to tender her resignation as a panel member of the Independent Inquiry into Grenfell Tower.  Diversity  In 2016, Mehra became the President of the Women's Engineering Society. Under her guidance, National Women in Engineering Day (NWED) became an international celebration. She has campaigned for women to be more readily welcomed back into the engineering workforce after time taken out for maternity leave, and encouraging small-to-medium enterprises to explore job-sharing for mid career workers. Mehra works to inspire the next generation, working with teachers and girls to highlight careers in engineering. She was a judge of the annual Top 50 Women in Engineering campaign run by the Women's Engineering Society in partnership with The Telegraph newspaper. She received an Honorary Doctorate for Science for her diversity work from Chichester University in 2017.

History The AO1 Foundation was founded by Philadelphia Eagles star quarterback Carson Wentz in June 2017. Wentz founded the organization primarily for underprivileged youth, the physically disabled and military veterans to be involved in his main hobbies; outdoor and wildlife activities. Wentz contributed his idea for a charitable organization based on his upbringing and religious views. The Carson Wentz AO1 (‚ÄúAudience of One‚Äù) Foundation focuses on three main objectives that reflect some of Wentz's deepest passions in life ‚Äì his faith, his enthusiasm for the outdoors and his avid love for dogs. The \\"audience of one\\" in the foundation's name refers to Jesus, as Wentz is a devout Christian. Ministries =Thy Kingdom Crumb= Founded in 2018 as a partnership between the Audience of One Foundation and The Connect Church, Thy Kingdom Crumb (TKC) exists to ‚ÄúDemonstrate the love of God and to infuse His hope by feeding all people and uplifting communities.‚Äù By distributing quality food with excellence, through community outreach, and the formation of Kingdom relationships, it is their goal to help all people experience the unconditional love of God in a tangible manner. TKC aims to identify various needs and opportunities within communities to better facilitate compassionate care. Forming Kingdom-based relationships with like- minded organizations, people, and communities will increase the reach, capabilities, and impact of their programs. =Outdoor Ministry= ‚ÄúFostering a genuine passion for the outdoors and bringing people closer to God through discipleship.‚Äù The AO1 Outdoor Ministry aims to serve those with physical challenges, life-threatening illnesses (past and present), and the underserved in order to ‚ÄúFoster a genuine passion for outdoor activities and bring people closer to God through discipleship.‚Äù This is accomplished by providing various hunting and fishing experiences and through Camp Conquerors. In this program, they share the culture of sporting as they believe valuable life lessons can be learned through the outdoors and that these outreach opportunities will demonstrate the love of God to their participants. =Haiti Sports Complex= ‚ÄúA partnership to bring hope to a nation through sport.‚Äù After visiting on a mission trip in the spring of 2017, Carson felt a calling for the Audience of One Foundation to establish a footprint in Haiti. He saw the great work Mission of Hope (MOH): Haiti had already been doing in the country, and together they began ‚ÄúA partnership to bring hope to a nation through sport‚Äù by building the Haiti Sports Complex. Only a few months after Carson's initial visit, the AO1 Foundation granted MOH: Haiti the funds to complete Phase I of the project, which includes a multipurpose building complete with locker rooms, bathrooms, showers, two basketball courts, and a sport court. With Phase I nearing completion, construction of Phase II is expected to begin shortly, which includes the addition of turf fields adjacent to the multipurpose building. Through the partnership with MOH: Haiti, the AO1 Foundation will continue to help fund, maintain, and run the Haiti Sports Complex.

There is no evidence in the sources regarding his descent, but apparently he did not belong to any notable aristocratic family. It is more likely that he rose thanks to his competence. He bore the high title of megas doux which meant that he was commander of the naval forces of Trebizond.ŒôœÉœÑŒøœÅŒØŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒïŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œøœç Œ≠Œ∏ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ, œÑŒøŒº.

John played an important role in the internal affairs of the Empire of Trebizond until his assassination in March 1344. Life The megas doux John is first mentioned in connection to the rise to the throne of Basil Grand Komnenos (), following the brief reigns of Andronikos III () and Manuel II (). The new emperor had Byzantine support and the support of some pro-Byzantine dignitaries. The measures he took shortly after his ascension against the local aristocracy of non-Greek descentKarpov, S.P., ¬´Trapezund i Konstantinopol v XIV veke¬ª, Vizantijskij vremennik 36 (1974), p. 86. are characteristic, while shortly afterwards Basil married Irene Palaiologina, the illegitimate daughter of the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. According to information related by Michael Panaretos, on 21 February 1333 the megas doux John participated in the events during which the recently deposed emperor Manuel II was murdered. A few years later the eunuch John was involved in the Trapezuntine Civil War, supporting Irene Palaiologina.

The group is also known by its French name \\"Les 7 doigts de la main\\", which is sometimes shortened to \\"Les 7 Doigts\\". History The 7 Fingers is a collective founded in 2002 by seven circus artists: Isabelle Chass√©, Shana Carroll, Patrick L√©onard, Faon Shane, Gypsy Snider, S√©bastien Soldevila, and Samuel T√©treault. Faon Shane leaves the company in 2008. Since 2003, the collective is led by Nassib El-Husseini, a political scientist, author, and former advisor to numerous governmental and non-governmental organizations both in Canada and abroad. On July 14, 2016, the collective created The 7 Fingers Foundation, to support the creation, production, and diffusion of new original projects, and to offer artistic residences, workshops, artistic mentoring, seminars etc. Until the end of 2017, the collective's headquarter was on 225 Roy East st. in Montreal. After 18 months of renovation work, The 7 Fingers moved to their new centre of creation and production, on 2111 Sain- Laurent boulevard, in the quartier des spectacles.

At each new residence, the show and its content evolve depending on the artists involved on stage, their performance and abilities, and on the reactions of the audience. The artists are mostly locals from the places of residency.

The building, located in the middle of the block, features a gymnasium and auditorium in the middle of the building, classrooms on the east and west sides of the building, and administrative offices on the south side. The building was designed at the time when extracurricular activities for sports and theatre, multi-function areas as gym/cafeteria and library/study hall, and \\"progressive education\\" ideologies that provided more hands-on learning for science, commercial, manual training, and domestic science were all becoming popular.

Campo, 2015 they even put houses and notary publics on fire, killed some important people, including two police officers. In Palermo the Bourbons were thrown out and they formed a provisional government which asked for independence; in order to suppress these insurrections, the king sent the general Florestano Pepe with about 60.000 soldiers from Naples. While Colonel Flugy was moving from Trapani towards Palermo, he was forced to withdraw with his troops as he was fought off by the rebels from Alcamo, rushed in great numbers in the area of the Crimisus(river) (fiume Freddo).

General Pepe, being considered weak against the rebels, was obliged to return to Naples, and General Pietro Colletta, who replaced him, suppressed the insurrection. The poet Peppi Enia, in his poem in eighths entitled Lu ribeddu di lu 1820, refers to the aedicula which today is located next to the chapel near the river, with these words: Pi stu triunfu di l'antichitati Sta figuredda a stu ciumi viditi. (That is: For this old triumph, you can see this ‚Äò‚Äôfiuredda‚Äô‚Äô near the river). =Description= The sanctuary was built in the early 1900s; inside it there is the statue of Our Lady of the River, carved by Giuseppe Ospedale in 1925, and a fresco on the ceiling realized by Liborio Pirrone, a painter from Alcamo. In May the chapel is a centre of pilgrimages, above all on Saturday mornings when they celebrate Mass. The feast, together with its rural festival, is held on the first Sunday of August.

The episode was written by Angela Kang and Corey Reed, and directed by John Polson. Plot In the days after the onset of the war against Negan and the Saviors, Rick (Andrew Lincoln), Maggie (Lauren Cohan) and Carol (Melissa McBride) correspond with each other to report on their victories and losses, and make plans to launch the next phase of the plan in a few days. Rick travels to the Scavengers' base to meet with Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh), showing her the Polaroid photos of their victories and offers to deal with them in his war despite their previous actions; Jadis refuses to deal. With no options left, Rick is taken and kept prisoner inside a shipping container, stripped down to his boxer shorts. At the Hilltop, Aaron (Ross Marquand) returns with baby Gracie. Jesus (Tom Payne) keeps watch over the Saviors they have captured, secured on the fence outside of the community. Maggie expresses disappointment that Jesus is using their supplies to provide them food and water, while Gregory (Xander Berkeley) suggest they build gallows to hang them. However, Jesus reminds them that by killing their prisoners they would be no better than the Saviors. Maggie later decides to allow the Saviors inside, imprisoned within in a makeshift cage, as long as they do not cause trouble. She then sends Gregory into the pen to be imprisoned with the Saviors, despite his loud protests, as she cannot trust him either. In private, Jesus thanks Maggie for keeping the Saviors alive, but she sees them as future bargaining chips. In the library, Aaron shares his feelings of loss with Maggie, who understands his pain firsthand. Taking Maggie's words to heart, Aaron decides to go on a personal mission. Before departing, Enid (Katelyn Nacon) offers to join him; Aaron agrees. In the Kingdom, Ezekiel (Khary Payton) has secluded himself in his home, refusing to allow others to see him. Carol works to prepare other able-bodied residents to help in Rick's plan. Henry (Macsen Lintz), Benjamin's younger brother, desperately wants to participate despite her hesitation, but she relents. Afterwards, Carol is able to approach Ezekiel and tries to encourage him to take up leadership again, even if he just maintains his act. Ezekiel remains reluctant to participate and tells her to leave him alone. Elsewhere, Carl (Chandler Riggs) goes scavenging outside Alexandria and encounters Siddiq (Avi Nash). Carl apologizes for Rick's previous hostility towards Siddiq, and offers him food and water. Seeing that Siddiq was trapping a walker, Carl asks Siddiq the three questions that Rick uses to judge potential members of his group and is impressed with his answers. Carl decides to lead Siddiq back to Alexandria, promising to vouch for him once they get there. En route, they are attacked by a small group of walkers, some which pin down Carl before he can dispatch them; appearing uninjured, they continue on. At Alexandria, Tara (Alanna Masterson) is surprised to find Daryl (Norman Reedus), fixated on taking his own actions outside of Rick's plan, waiting on her porch. When she vows to kill Dwight after the war is over, Daryl proposes they kill him together and suggests that they don't have to wait. Meanwhile, Michonne (Danai Gurira) is anxious to know what is happening, feeling responsible for the war as she had urged Rick to take a stand toward the Saviors. Rosita (Christian Serratos) offers to come with her to see what is happening at the Sanctuary. En route, they hear loud music and find two Saviors nearby trying to load a truck with speakers, which they plan to use to lure away the walkers surrounding the Sanctuary. Michonne and Rosita kill one of them, but the other escapes with the truck, until it is sideswiped by a garbage truck driven by Daryl and Tara, killing the other Savior. The four travel together to the Sanctuary, seeing the walkers still surround it; Daryl decides they need to take action now.

As a state-operated university, it participates in the SNMPTN admissions system. One of the three state universities and many others in the city, it was originally founded as a branch of the Sunan Ampel State Islamic University Surabaya in 1965. It later separated into its own organization in 1997, and was formally made a university in 2004. History In Indonesia, State Islamic Institutes (Institut Agama Islam Negeri, IAIN) trace their origins from Islamic boarding schools known as pesantren. On 1961, the Ministry of Religious Affairs founded branches of IAIN Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta in the cities of Surabaya and Malang. The Malang branch acted as the faculty of Tarbiyah (Islamic education). Later on, the three were merged into IAIN Sunan Ampel before the Malang branch separated in 1997, due to a presidential decree mandating the creation of separate Islamic institutes (referred to as Sekolah Tinggi Agama Islam Negeri or STAIN) across the country. After its 1997 separation, the university was once more renamed to Universitas Islam Indonesia Sudan (Indonesian-Sudanese Islamic University) by vice president Hamzah Haz on 21 July 2002 as a result of a cooperation between Indonesia and Sudan ‚Äì marking its transition to university status. Two years later, following Presidential Decree No. 50/2004, released on 21 June 2004, the university was renamed to Universitas Negeri Islam Malang (Islamic State University of Malang). The date was assumed by the university as its founding date. The name changes, from IAIN Malang to STAIN Malang to UIIS to UIN Malang, all occurred under a single rector and earned the institute a national record for \\"Most University Name Changes\\". In 2009, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono once more altered the university's name - this time to Universitas Islam Negeri Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang, based from Wali Songo member Malik Ibrahim. This further name change was preceded by a massive expansion of university facilities, partly funded by the Islamic Development Bank. Students and faculties Compared to Brawijaya University and Malang State University, UIN Maliki takes in the fewest freshmen annually, with 2,500 students in 2014 compared to over 12,000 for Brawijaya and about 7,000 for Malang State. Of the 2,500 figure, 700 originated from SNMPTN while the rest was directly filtered by the university. The university has two campuses, with a third one under construction at the nearby city of Batu as of 2016.

She raised her eight children alone after the death of her husband in 1814, passed on her human values and encouraged them to pursue their studies. An \\"Arago clan\\" was formed around her eldest son, Fran√ßois, at the Paris Observatory, including Claude-Louis Mathieu (who married his sister Marguerite), Alexander von Humboldt and F√©lix Savary.  Biography =Origins and youth (1755‚Äì1778)= Marie-Anne-Agathe Roig was born on 3 November 1755 in Corneilla-la-Rivi√®re, a village of about 700 inhabitants in the province of Roussillon, a Catalan language region that had belonged to France since 1659. Her father, Fran√ßois Roig, was a \\"pag√®s\\", a well-to-do peasant, from Corneilla-la-Riviere. He was a soldier with the rank of an officer. Her paternal grandfather, Camo Roig, was a doctor. Her paternal uncle was pastor of Ponteilla. This is another village in the same region of southern France, about a dozen kilometers southeast of Corneilla-la-Rivi√®re. Her mother, named Victoire Brial, was the daughter of a \\"pag√®s\\" of Cam√©las. This village is also located about twelve kilometers from Corneilla-la- Rivi√®re, but south-southwest. At a time when almost all women in the region were illiterate (90% of women of her generation were unable to sign their marriage certificates), she learned to read and write alone, while hiding, from books written in Latin. = Estagel (1778‚Äì1797)= A peasant woman from Roussillon, c. 1830 (lithograph by James Duffield Harding) On 12 August 1778, with a dowry of 2,200 livres, she married Fran√ßois Bonaventure Arago in Corneilla-la-Rivi√®re. He was a pag√®s with a degree in law. They would have eleven children. They raised them in the local Catalan language. The couple moved to Estagel, a Roussillon town of 1,000 inhabitants. It is located a dozen kilometers north of Corneilla-la-Rivi√®re. Fran√ßois Bonaventure Arago was of the same social background as Marie Roig. A farmer and moderately well-off proprietor, he was orphaned at a very young age and was raised by an uncle, a priest who enrolled him in law school in Perpignan. His social background, however, did not allow him to take a more prestigious job as a notary or lawyer. In 1779 Marie Arago gave birth to a daughter, Marie-Rose, who died in 1780. 1780 was also the year of the birth and death of Arago's second daughter, Marie-Th√©r√®se. A third girl, named Marie-Victoire, was born and died in infancy in 1783. Meanwhile, in 1782, the couple gave birth to another daughter, Rose, who lived until 1832. In 1781 her husband began a political career, gradually climbing the ladder in the municipal affairs of the village of Estagel until becoming, from June 1786 to June 1787, first consul of the village, which corresponds to the mandate of a mayor today. In 1789, he wrote a large part of the Cahiers de dol√©ances (Book of grievances) of Estagel. He became in 1790 the first mayor of the commune newly created by the revolution, then in the following years was given high departmental responsibilities. Mary gave birth to other children: Fran√ßois (1786), Jean (1788), Jacques (1790), Victor (1792), Joseph (1796) and Marguerite (1798). All were born in Estagel. During the War of the Pyrenees in 1793 Fran√ßois Bonaventure commanded the National Guard of Estagel. This was an army of volunteer citizens formed to defend the Revolution against the Spanish enemy. The family gave lodgings to many French soldiers and officers, to which Fran√ßois, the eldest son, then aged seven, would later attribute his taste for military matters.. =Perpignan (1797‚Äì1816)= =Return to Estagel (1816‚Äì1845)= After the death of her daughter Rose, Marie Arago became, at age 77, the guardian of Rose's four children.  Famille et entourage  According to Muriel Toulotte, biographer of √âtienne Arago, \\"all her life, Marie Arago had a huge influence on her children and also on all those around her\\". The children of Marie and Fran√ßois Bonaventure Arago all behaved with righteousness and honesty, following the example of their father. From their mother, they gained at the same time the dynamism that animated them, kindness towards others and great gaiety. On the other hand, the boys were much less religious than their mother. Jacques was not a believer and √âtienne went as far as asking to be buried without any religious ceremony. She had six sons, all of whom distinguished themselves: * Fran√ßois (1786‚Äì1853), astronomer, physician and French politician *Jean (1788‚Äì1836), cashier of the mint of Perpignan, then illustrious soldier in Mexico *Jacques (1790‚Äì1854), novelist, playwright and explorer *Victor (1792‚Äì1867), polytechnic, soldier *Joseph (1796‚Äì1860), soldier in the Mexican army; *√âtienne (1802‚Äì1892), playwright and politician, mayor of Paris in 1870. She also gave birth to five daughters, only two of whom survived infancy: Rose (1782‚Äì1832) and Marguerite (1798‚Äì1859), who married Claude-Louis Mathieu in 1824.

Built in 1856 and extensively altered after a move in 1899, it is a good example of a Colonial Revival district schoolhouse built out of brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Stony Hill School is located in southern Windsor, on the west side of Windsor Avenue (Connecticut Route 159) just north of its junction with Hillcrest Road. It is a single-story masonry structure, with a rectangular main block and projecting entry vestibule, each covered by a gabled roof. The gable ends are framed in wood and finished in shingles, and have returns at the base. The entry projection is symmetrical, with two small square fixed-pane windows flanking an arched entrance with transom window. Windows are otherwise set in rectangular openings, with cut brownstone sills and slightly splayed headers made of soldier bricks. A wood-frame addition to the rear of the building provides space originally used as an outhouse. The school was built in 1856 to a simpler plan, and was originally located across the street. In 1899, Doctor Evastus Case traded with the town, giving them this parcel in exchange for the one on which it stood. At that time the building underwent major alterations, giving it its present form. It is relatively little altered since that time, and is an good example of Colonial Revival architecture.

In addition to books and print materials, the library offers patrons access to eBooks and databases through the OCLN, as well as lending museum passes to area museums and zoos, coordinating free tutoring for adults in Basic Literacy and English to Speakers of Other Languages, and housing local historical and genealogical materials in the Stoughton Collection. Established in 1874, the library is currently temporarily located at 529 Washington Street, Stoughton, MA. The permanent location, at 84 Park Street, is undergoing a large-scale renovation to expand the library's current space from 22,000 square feet to 31,058 square feet and is projected to re-open in May 2018.  History  March 12, 1874 was the first meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Stoughton Public Library, preceding the opening of the library on March 17 at its original location in Morton Square. Wales French was the first to hold the position of librarian. In 1881 the Board applied to businessman and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie for funding for a dedicated library building and was denied. The library moved three times and by 1900 was located inside Stoughton Town Hall. In 1902 the Board of Trustees requested private donations to build a library. Lucius B. Clapp, a local farmer, selectman, and library trustee, anonymously donated $25,000 to cover the cost of the building. A donation from Henry L. Pierce was used to purchase books. The architect, Walter Atherton, was trained at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the L‚ÄôEcole des Beaux Arts in Paris and had been raised on the lot adjacent to the land purchased from his family to be used for the library. The library, a brick Georgian Revival, was dedicated on June 30, 1904. The building housed the library as well as the Stoughton Historical Society at 6 Park Street. In 1969 a modern library was built to meet the needs of the town at nearby 84 Park Street. The old building was renamed the Lucius Clapp Memorial and continued to house the Stoughton Historical Society. The new 22,000 square foot building with a 96,000 book capacity acquired the name Stoughton Public Library. In May 2011 Stoughton residents approved a $14 million renovation to the library. The funding includes $7 million in a matching grant from the Massachusetts Public Library Construction Program. The renovated space will increase the size of the library to 31,058 square feet and will include improvements to make it accessible to patrons with disabilities as well as adding a cafe on the second floor. Boston-based architecture firm Finegold Alexander Architects designed the renovated space.

Description and history The Sophia Sweetland House stands in northern Windsor, on the east side of Palisado Avenue (Connecticut Route 159) a short way north of its junction with Bissell Ferry Road. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with a front-facing gabled roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance in the right bay, framed by sidelight and transom windows. It is sheltered by a porch with slender columns and brackets that form arched openings, and has a low-pitch roof with extended eaves supported by decoratively cut brackets. Windows are generally set in rectangular openings, with brownstone sills and lintels. The exception is the front gable window, which is set in a round-arch opening. Two-story sections project from either side, with a corbelled cornice running below the roof line. The house was built about 1845 by Isaac Sweetland, a farmer who lived here with his wife Sophia. The house's Greek Revival features include the roof gable orientation and window treatments, while the Italianate is represented in the entrance porch and gable window.

Once regarded as a promising talent in Vietnamese football, Th√°i Sung's youth career has been unsuccessful due to contract disputes with his club. Personal life Nguy·ªÖn Th√°i Sung was born on 22 September 1994. He was the youngest of three children on Tr∆∞·ªùng Chinh Street in Da Nang to a rather poor family. His father is a retired North Vietnamese soldier who fought in the war while his mother is a street vendor who sells breakfast snacks. Club career As Th√°i Sung's family was too poor to afford gas money to drive him to practice, Th√°i Sung was forced to play football in unconventional settings. However after he was scouted he became the first Vietnamese player to receive a scholarship from abroad, being sponsored by the Qatar Aspire Institute from 2009-2012. Th√°i Sung took part in the 2012 youth games where he was named in the top 10 players. After returning to Vietnam in 2012 Th√°i Sung signed with local club SHB ƒê√† N·∫µng. Life at Da Nang however was far from easy as Th√°i Sung was not favored by coaches because of his short stature and unconventional playing style, limiting his opportunities. Th√°i Sung was later offered an opportunity to train with Sporting CP's youth academy in 2014 but Da Nang blocked the move. Th√°i Sung was also called up for the Vietnam under-21 side in 2015 but despite being praised by the coach was rarely played as his style did not suite the team. In 2014 Th√°i Sung wasn't even allowed to play, rather he was utilized to carry water for the SHB Da Nang u-23 side. In late 2015 Th√°i Sung finally got playing time when he was loaned out to Ha Noi FC in the second division, helping the team reach promotion. The next season Th√°i Sung was loaned out the same team again who had now moved to Ho Chi Minh City, but despite that Th√°i Sung only played three matches in 2016. Bui Xuan Hoa, the chair of SHB Da Nang said in an interview that he thought that Th√°i Sung's stalled career was due to his talent being coached out of him by the Aspire Institute, who he said cannot even compare to a middle school football team in Vietnam.

the transport network that were proposed in 2016 and is part of Welsh Labour's plan for North Wales. Labour has pledged to open the system by 2035. The proposals were included in the 2018 Wales & Borders franchise contest. The Metro is conceptually a multi-modal system with a combination of bus, heavy rail and light rail services linking major settlements and employment areas with hubs located in Wrexham, Chester and Deeside. Plans Proposals include new stations at Deeside Industrial Estate and North Wrexham, upgrades to railway stations, and new bus routes to improve connections. Further upgrades to existing rail routes are also proposed. As part of the new Wales & Borders franchise, operated by Transport for Wales Rail, it has been announced that modernisation of the Borderlands Line between Wrexham and Bidston will be the first phase of the North Wales Metro. Electro-diesel Class 230 Metro trains will be deployed in 2019, with services increased to 2 trains per hour in each direction from 2021, one as a stopping service and the other as an express with limited stops. In April 2018, a cash boost of ¬£1.2 million was award to the proposed scheme which included a new station at Deeside.

Early life and state football In her early teens, she reverted to other sports when football was no longer an option due to league rules and a lack of girls' sides. She played hockey and basketball before becoming an elite rower. At the age of 21, she returned to football with VWFL club Eastern Devils, and was their leading goalkicker between 2005 and 2008, before switching to defence and playing as a key defender for eight seasons.

During her time at the Eastern Devils, Hutchins was also co-captain of the club, won the Helen Lambert Medal as the VWFL best and fairest, and was selected as All-Australian six times. In May 2017, after returning to the Eastern Devils for the off- season between the 2017 and 2018 AFLW seasons, Hutchins made her 200th appearance for the club. AFL Women's career In March 2016, Collingwood chief executive officer Gary Pert was approached by Hutchins, who offered the benefit of her experience and acted as an advisor to the Collingwood board, supervising the recruitment and development of players, coaches and staff. Collingwood created a job for her, named Women's Football Operations Manager. In August 2016, Hutchins joined as a priority pick, fulfilling her childhood dream of playing for Collingwood in the AFL. She made her debut in round 1, 2017, in the inaugural AFLW match at IKON Park against .

Collingwood re-signed Hutchins for the 2018 season during the trade period in May 2017. She was delisted by Collingwood at the end of the 2018 season after the club announced they would not give her a contract for the 2019 season, she subsequently joined 's Victorian Football League Women's team.

The Ministry of the Automotive Industry (Minavtoprom; ) was a government ministry in the Soviet Union. The Ministry of the Automotive industry operated about 300 plants and numerous research and development organizations. Most key facilities belonged to a production association, and most associations consisted of a lead Ô¨Ånal assembly plant and numerous satellite plants. Eight production associations produced nearly all trucks and about one-half of all buses; four produced almost all Soviet passenger cars. In the mid-1980s the ministry produced about 250 truck, 60 automobile, and 35 bus models and modiÔ¨Åcations and 50 types of trailers and attachments. The ministry also maintained its own internal R&D; base for vehicle design and production technology development. History Before 1965 the automotive industry was subordinate to several different administrative organizations including: the Central Administration of State Automotive Plants (1922-1941); the People's Commissariat for Medium Machine Building (1941-1945); the Ministry of the Automobile industry (1945-1947); the Ministry of the Automobile and Tractor Industry (1947-1953); the Ministry of Machine Building (1953-1954); and the Ministry of the Automobile Industry (1955-1957). In 1957 most industrial ministries were abolished and replaced with regional economic councils. In 1965 the present ministerial structure was introduced. Production associations were introduced in the mid-1960s to increase manufacturing efficiency through a uniÔ¨Åed administrative structure that usually brings together in a single enterprise a major manufacturer and its principal suppliers. This structure is supposed to provide coordinated production programs among cooperating plants, more efÔ¨Åcient use of resources, and more rapid assimilation of technological advances. In November 1991 the Ministry became the Open Joint-Stock Company Avtoselkhozmash Holding.

It has a single tubular, dark green leaf and up to eighty scented, yellow-green flowers with red or brown marking. It is similar to P. colensoi, the only other species of Prasophyllum found in New Zealand, but is distinguished from it by its larger size, larger number of flowers and swampy habitat. Description Prasophyllum hectori is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single dark green to yellowish-green, tube-shaped, rush-like leaf which is usually taller than the flowering stem. The flowering stem emerges from the leaf about one-third of the leaf's length from its base. Between ten and eighty scented, well-spaced flowers are arranged along a flowering spike about long. The flowers are yellow to greenish, long with a mostly white labellum. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is broadly egg-shaped, dished, long and the lateral sepals are narrow oblong, slightly longer than the dorsal sepal and free from each other. The petals are slightly shorter and thinner than the lateral sepals. The labellum is egg-shaped and turns sharply upwards about half way from its base. The edges of the labellum are white and wavy and there is a light green callus in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from December to February. Taxonomy and naming The swamp leek orchid was first formally described in 1887 by John Buchanan who gave it the name Gastrodia hectori and published the description in Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. In 2005, Brian Molloy, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Prasophyllum hectori. The specific epithet (hectori) honours the naturalist James Hector. Distribution and habitat Prasophyllum hectori is found on the North and Chatham Island islands where it grows in wetlands, usually in or new slow-flowing streams, often with sedges. Conservation The swamp leek orchid is classified as \\"at risk and declining by the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

Hydraulic mortar was not available in ancient China, possibly due to a lack of volcanic ash. Around 500 CE, sticky rice soup was mixed with slaked lime to make an inorganic‚àíorganic composite mortar that had more strength and water resistance than lime mortar. Sticky rice played a major role in maintaining the durability of the Great Wall as well as tombs, pagodas, and city walls. Sticky rice mortar had high adhesive strength, sturdiness, waterproofing capability, and prevented weeds from growing as crude mortar made of sticky rice and burnt lime created a seal between bricks that would rival modern cement in strength. During the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644 AD), brick-making techniques improved significantly in terms of quantity and quality of production. Since then, Great Wall sections were widely built with bricks, with lime mortar and sticky rice used to reinforce the bricks strongly enough to resist earthquakes and modern bulldozers while keeping the building intact. Modern chemists, through their research, identified amylopectin, a type of polysaccharide, or complex carbohydrate, found in rice and other starchy foods to appear to be responsible for the sticky rice mortar's strength and durability.

The decision came down to placing the names of both Stubbs-Smith and Pratt in a box and drawing the victor, with Stubbs-Smith therefore being counted as the victor by a single vote. Pratt's challenge was on the basis of a single Turks and Caicos Islander being unable to vote as they found their name was not on the electoral roll when she attended the Polling Station.

It was acquired by the Cascais Municipality in October 2004 and is now a museum. It blends several different architectural styles and influences. History In the late 19th century, Jorge O'Neil, an aristocrat connected to the tobacco industry, purchased some land near the Santa Marta area of Cascais. He first had built what is now the Condes de Castro Guimar√£es Museum and, a little later, commissioned the Casa de Santa Maria as a wedding present for his daughter. This dates from 1902 and was designed by the architect Raul Lino, who began his career in Cascais, designing a series of houses for friends. In the case of Santa Maria, he was instructed to disregard the popular styles of the time and design the house using only materials found within Portugal. The eventual design was heavily influenced by the Moorish style of construction, which had shaped many of Portugal's finest buildings. This influence is most visible inside the building, with horseshoe arches connecting the central rooms. Around 1914, the property was sold to the engineer Jos√© Lino J√∫nior, the older brother of Raul Lino, the architect. Lino, a major collector and art lover, purchased, from an old chapel in Frielas, a set of 17th century Azulejo tiles and a wooden oil-painted ceiling, which has been attributed to Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes. He expanded the building by adding parts at each end, with the work also being designed by Raul Lino. A view from the front of the house In 1934, the house was acquired by the Esp√≠rito Santo family, who received famous visitors such as Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, King Umberto II of Italy, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Other visitors to the house have included the former US President, Richard Nixon. Contents The house can now be visited from Tuesdays to Sundays. It has no movable artefacts but contains a rich collection of tiles and painting, primarily from the Portuguese Baroque. On the ground floor the walls of the rooms are covered with polychrome blue and yellow painted tiles, originally from the Marvila Convent in Lisbon. On the first floor, the Chapel contains tiled narrative scenes from the Virgin Mary's life, produced in Talavera, Spain at the end of the 16th Century. Floral motifs painted on the ceiling are by Raul Lino. Next door is the Great Hall with a painted ceiling and tile-lined walls. The basement contains avant-garde painted tiles from around 1920, also designed by the architect.

Breast milk supply augments in response to the baby's demand for milk, and decreases when milk is allowed to remain in the breasts. Low milk supply is usually caused by allowing milk to remain in the breasts for long periods of time, or insufficiently draining the breasts during feeds. It is usually preventable, unless caused by medical conditions that have been estimated to affect up to five percent of women. Several common misconceptions often lead mothers to believe they have insufficient milk when they are in fact producing enough. Actual low milk supply is likely if the baby is latching and swallowing well at the breast, is nevertheless not growing well or is showing signs of dehydration or malnutrition, and does not have a medical condition that would explain the lack of growth. The main method for increasing milk supply is improved breastfeeding practices and/or expressing milk through pumping or hand expression. The medication domperidone increases milk supply for some women. For mothers who cannot breastfeed exclusively, breastfeeding as much as possible, with supplementary formula feeding as necessary, offers many benefits over formula alone. Causes premature infants cannot suck effectively, which can lead to decreased milk production in the mother. Low milk supply can be either primary (caused by medical conditions or anatomical issues in the mother), secondary (caused by not thoroughly and regularly removing milk from the breasts) or both. Secondary causes are far more common than primary ones. The incidence of primary lactation insufficiency is not known, but has been estimated at up to 5% of women. Breastfeeding management issues that can interfere with regular milk drainage from the breast include poor latch, unnecessary use of supplemental formula, timed or scheduled feedings (as opposed to on-demand feedings), and overuse of pacifiers. Medical conditions in the infant that result in weak or unco-ordinated sucking can cause low milk supply by inhibiting the transfer of milk to the baby. These conditions include tongue-tie, congenital heart defects, prematurity, and Down syndrome. Primary causes of low milk supply include: * insufficient glandular tissue, also known as primary lactation failure. Breasts with insufficient glandular tissue often have a tubular shape, with a large space between the breasts, and often do not grow during pregnancy. * retained placenta * Sheehan's syndrome * prior breast surgery (especially breast reduction) * prior nipple piercing * polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) * hypothyroidism * hypoprolactinemia * theca lutein cysts * hypertension * pregnancy Smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day is associated with reduced milk production. Many medications are known to significantly suppress milk production, including pseudoephedrine, diuretics, and contraceptives that contain estrogen. It is suspected that some herbs, particularly sage and peppermint, suppress milk production. Mechanism Early skin-to-skin contact between mother and newborn promotes the establishment of a plentiful milk supply. The physiological mechanisms that regulate breast milk supply are poorly understood. High levels of prolactin are necessary for lactation, however there is no direct correlation between baseline levels of prolactin and quantity of milk production. One aspect of supply regulation that has been identified is that breast milk contains a peptide called feedback inhibitor of lactation (FIL). When milk is present in the breast, FIL inhibits the secretion of milk. After a mother's milk comes in, a reduction in supply is inevitable unless milk is removed regularly and thoroughly from the breasts. Surgery or injury to the breast can decrease supply by disrupting milk ducts that carry milk from the alveoli, where milk is produced, to the nipple. Retained placenta results in high levels of progesterone, a hormone that inhibits lactation. Diagnosis A woman's belief that her milk supply is insufficient is one of the most common reasons for discontinuing breastfeeding. In many of those cases, the woman's milk supply is actually normal. After a few weeks or months of breastfeeding, changes that are commonly mistaken for signs of low milk supply include breasts feeling softer (this is normal after 1‚Äì3 months), more frequent demands by the infant to feed, feeds becoming shorter over time, baby colic, the perception that the baby is more satisfied after being fed infant formula, and a slowdown in growth after three months. To evaluate whether milk supply is actually insufficient, qualitative parameters should be used such as the following: * By 3‚Äì5 days, of age, the infant should be stooling 3‚Äì4 times per day and urinating 3‚Äî5 times per day. By 5‚Äì7 days of age, there should be 3‚Äî6 stools per day and 4‚Äî6 urines. * The infant should be alert, have good muscle tone, and show no signs of dehydration. * The infant should be consistently gaining weight and growing. In newborns, a loss of more than 5 to 7 percent of birth weight warrants investigation. The use of IV fluids in labour tends to artificially increase the birth weight of the baby, and subsequently inflate the baby's weight loss. Newborns should regain their birth weight by two weeks of age, and gain at least 150 g per week. If an infant is not showing these signs of growing well, other possible causes include: * Poor milk transfer due to tongue-tie, or cleft palate. * Medical conditions in the infant, such as malabsorption of nutrients. =Definition= A mother is considered to have low milk supply if she produces less breast milk than her infant requires. The term is used only after a mother's milk \\"comes in\\", which usually occurs around 30‚Äì40 hours after delivery of a full-term infant. Low milk supply is distinct from the scenario in which the mother's milk comes in later than normal but is thereafter produced in sufficient quantities; this is known as delayed onset of lactation (delayed lactogenesis II). Prevention The first week after birth is a critical window for establishing milk supply. The Ten Steps of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative describe some maternity hospital practices that promote the development of a good milk supply, such as rooming in (allowing mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day) and having trained staff available to help mothers with breastfeeding. Supplemental formula or donor milk should be given only when medically necessary. Frequent suckling in the first days of life is correlated with higher milk production. Infants should be fed when they show signs of hunger. It is common for breastfed babies to feed during the night for the first six months. Usually feedings last 10‚Äì15 minutes in the early days. If the infant is unable to breastfeed, it is recommended that pumping or hand expression of milk begin within two hours of delivery, and be done at least eight times every 24 hours. Management In this video, a mother uses breast compression during a feed to increase the flow of milk (1 minute, 37 seconds) Using a breast pump can maintain and improve milk supply if the baby is unable to nurse effectively. Attempts to increase milk supply should begin promptly as the longer low supply continues, the more difficult it is to reverse. The primary method for increasing milk supply is to increase the frequency and the thoroughness of milk drainage from the breasts, and to increase breast stimulation. For mothers of healthy term infants who are able to nurse, very strong evidence supports improving breastfeeding practices as a primary treatment. Increasing skin-to-skin contact between mother and baby, and allowing unrestricted breastfeeding, aid in stimulating the milk ejection reflex and promote frequent feeds. If the baby's latch is not optimal, improving the latch will help the baby drink more milk. Making the mother comfortable, particularly by resolving nipple pain, is essential. Breast self- massage is recommended to stimulate the milk ejection reflex and to physically promote the flow of milk. Some experts recommend using a breast pump after each breastfeeding session. If the baby cannot nurse effectively, frequent drainage of milk from the breasts through hand expression and/or an electric double breast pump is recommended. The mother's use of medications and herbs should be evaluated, as some substance suppress lactation. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol for low milk supply recommends that the mother be evaluated for medical causes of the problem, however health professionals and breastfeeding counsellors often do not do this. =Medications and herbs= After the above treatment methods have been attempted, many breastfeeding specialists and lactation consultants recommend medications or herbs that are believed to increase milk supply (galactagogues). In 2010, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study demonstrated that domperidone increased milk production in mothers of preterm infants. Another very small study of domperidone found that some women respond to it and others do not. As the effects of domperidone stop when use of the drug is stopped, it is sometimes used for months. Domperidone is available by prescription in Canada, Australia, many parts of Europe, and other countries, but not in the United States. Several herbs, including fenugreek and milk thistle are traditionally and widely used with the intention of promoting milk supply. For these herbs, there are anecdotal reports of efficacy which may be due to placebo effect. Scientific evidence for the efficacy of herbal galactagogues is insufficient or nonexistent. The Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine protocol for low milk supply says that there is insufficient data to recommend specific medicinal or herbal galactagogues, but that some substances may be useful in some cases. =Supplementary feeding= If the mother's milk supply is insufficient, formula or (preferably) donor milk is necessary in order for the infant to obtain adequate nutrients. Supplements should be given immediately after a breastfeeding session, rather than in place of a breastfeeding session. The use of supplements is gradually tapered off as the mother's own milk supply rebounds. In some cases, especially when low supply is caused by medical conditions such as insufficient glandular tissue, long-term use of supplements is necessary. For mothers who cannot breastfeed exclusively, breastfeeding as much as possible, with formula feeding as necessary, offers many benefits over formula alone.

The work examines the reasons for Sparta's power and renown, despite the city state's sparse population. There are fifteen chapters: the first thirteen enumerate the practices and institutions that made Sparta great; the last two describe Sparta's decline and the survival of its monarchy. The Polity dates to the period between 387 and 375 BC, and is the only contemporary account of the Spartan political system which survives. Together with Plutarch's \\"Life of Lycurgus\\", it provides the most detailed surviving description of the Spartan state, and is considered the best source of information about Spartan women during classical antiquity. Authorship and dating The Polity of the Lacedaemonians is included in the collection of Xenophon's works that have survived, and its attribution to Xenophon is supported by a mention to that effect in the works of Plutarch.Xenophon, Hellenica 73. The consensus of the majority scholarly opinion of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is that Xenophon is the author of the work.Lipka 6: \\"Despite these doubts, the majority of scholars of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries regarded the SC as genuine\\". Any imperfections are considered minor in comparison to its overall structure and composition, and are attributed to publication errors and editing by others through the centuries, or even to distressing events in Xenophon's life. Based on the contents of the work, Chapterxiv is dated at 378BC, about the time of the Second Athenian League in 375BC. The chapters prior to that are dated to within the nine years before 378BC, i.e. 387‚Äì378 BC.Xenophon, Hellenica 74. Motivation In the introduction, Xenophon writes: It is theorised that Xenophon's attention was focused on Sparta following a military victory of some sort by that state. It appears that the event most likely to have impressed Xenophon was the victory of Sparta over Athens during the Peloponnesian War, which occurred when Xenophon was a young man. He describes all Spartan laws and practices as deriving from Lycurgus's reforms which were also believed to have been sanctified by Apollo at Delphi. The majority of modern scholars categorise the work as an encomium for Sparta. Content and structure The work consists of fifteen chapters, numbered I to XV. In the first thirteen chapters, Xenophon examines the attributes of the Spartan state that contributed to making Sparta such a powerful and renowned city in ancient Hellas.Proietti 45. The last two chapters diverge from that focus and concentrate instead on the decline of Sparta, and then on the survival of the monarchy in the declining state.Proietti 44-45. In Chapter I Xenophon enumerates the parenting methods used by the Spartans to create strong children. ChaptersII‚ÄìIV describe the education of the Spartan children as a lifelong process that starts when they are very young and continues into adulthood. Xenophon explains how this educational process produces humble and law-abiding citizens who at the same time can be daring and ingenious. He also mentions that the Spartans practiced hunting for most of their lives. ChapterV describes the Spartan institutions that produce citizens who are moderate in their habits, possess good public manners, and are physically strong through regular exercise. Chapter VI explains Spartan egalitarianism, and Spartans' indifference to economic status, as well as their willingness to help those of lesser means. ChapterVII discusses the Spartans' utter disregard for money, their keen interest in civic duty, and their commitment to the freedom of Sparta. ChapterVIII describes the Spartans' deference and obedience to their laws and authorities, and the power of the Spartan government to administer justice. Chapter IX refers to the Spartan sense of honour, which compelled them to prefer an honourable death in battle to surrendering. ChapterX details how Spartan society promotes good citizenship though public awards, while ChaptersXI to XIII detail Spartan military strategy, leadership, and ethos. In Chapter XIV, Xenophon changes direction, and instead of further explaining the things that made Sparta great, he enumerates how the contemporary state of Sparta has become corrupt, and no longer obeys the laws of Lycurgus. In the same chapter, Xenophon further explains how this decline in Spartan morals and prestige has caused the other Greek states to no longer look up to Sparta for leadership, but instead to team up against Sparta to prevent it from ruling over the rest of Greece. In ChapterXV, Xenophon ends by telling how, despite its decline, the city state has remained faithful to the institution of the king.

It was acquired by the sultan in 1532. The rivalry with the Habsburg Monarchy was one of the most significant political and military relationships addressed by the sultan during his reign. In addition to military campaigns, S√ºleyman also took political and diplomatic steps in order to advance the Ottoman position, promoting trade with European powers and purchasing expensive jewels such as the helmet. The key figures behind the purchase of the helmet were Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha and his chief advisors, ƒ∞skender √áelebi, the chief treasurer, and Alvise Gritti, a powerful jewellery merchant based in the Ottoman capital Istanbul. After the 16th century, the helmet was long known only from the closely similar prints by Agostino Veneziano and others (it is not entirely clear which of these first created the image). These appear to combine the features of S√ºleyman lifted from other portraits available in Venice, while the helmet itself was recorded when it was exhibited in Venice, before it reached the sultan. The helmet was widely thought to be a fanciful invention of the printmakers, until 20th-century scholars rediscovered the records of the real object.Keating, 54-55; another print, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art Design and iconography The helmet-crown consisted of four crowns set inside an Austrian-style helmet, and was topped by \\"a plumed aigrette with a crescent-shaped mount\\". The crown was made of gold, and studded with \\"enormous twelve-carat pearls, a head band with pointed diamonds, forty-seven rubies, twenty-seven emeralds, forty-nine pearls, and a large turquoise\\". The total value of the piece was estimated at 115,000 Venetian ducats. Later sources greatly inflated the value of the piece, with some claiming it was worth upwards of 500,000 ducats. Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, famous for his taste for finery, likely commissioned the crown in 1532 from Venetian goldsmith Luigi Caorlini and his partners. Ibrahim Pasha‚Äôs advisors, the Venetian-born Alvise Gritti, and the defterdar (treasury secretary) Iskender, were instrumental in organising the commission and purchase. Gritti in particular made a fortune supplying S√ºleyman with gold and fine jewels from Europe. The helmet was probably conceived as a response to the coronation of the Habsburg ruler Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor two years previously by Pope Clement VII. The helmet‚Äôs design suggests it was a direct rebuke to both Charles‚Äôs crown and the three-tiered tiara worn by the Pope. The four tiers of the helmet trumped the Pope and advertised Sultan S√ºleyman‚Äôs claim to world domination. The helmet was delivered on May 12, 1532 to Ibrahim Pasha from Venice. Use The helmet may never have been worn by S√ºleyman, but is recorded as being used as part of a display of extravagant objects set out beside him to impress Western envoys.Keating, 54-55 The helmet played a role during S√ºleyman‚Äôs campaign against the Habsburg capital, Vienna, in 1532. As part of a larger set of objects, including a bejeweled saddle and throne, the helmet was meant to advertise to a European audience not only the Ottoman sultan‚Äôs vast wealth, but also his claims to the title of Emperor and universal sovereignty. Contemporary accounts state \\"an enormous fortune was spent to exhibit the sultan‚Äôs magnificence\\" as the helmet and other regalia were paraded from Istanbul towards Vienna. In Belgrade, streets were decorated with triumphal arches in the style of the Roman Empire as S√ºleyman marched through along with a retinue of pages dressed in finery, including one that likely wore the helmet. In the city of Nish, Habsburg envoys were made to watch a similar procession from the top of a minaret. Later, those same envoys appeared before the sultan. The carefully choreographed audience left the envoys \\"speechless corpses\\" as they gazed on the helmet, together with an associated collection of gold and jeweled items laid out in the Sultan‚Äôs reception tent. The impact of this parade lasted long after the campaign of 1532. Woodcuts of the crown were partly responsible for S√ºleyman‚Äôs title of \\"Magnificent\\" in the West. The image of the crown also seeped into European plays and operas of the time.  Destruction and loss  Despite its enormous cost, the helmet had little meaning in an Ottoman context, as sultans did not traditionally wear crowns. It is likely that the four crowns topping the helmet were melted down for reuse at a later date, while the helmet itself, which formed the lowest level of the piece, was possibly presented as a gift to Ferdinand I, Holy Roman EmperorNecipoƒülu, G√ºlru. ‚ÄúS√ºleyman the Magnificent and the Representation of Power in the Context of Ottoman-Hapsburg-Papal Rivalry.‚Äù The Art Bulletin, vol. 71, no. 3, 1989, pp. 416.

In the case of spectral data, the shape of the reflectance curve should unmask fine points of the spectra usually not considered by existing band-specific indices. It has been used to identify spectral regions for chlorophyll and carotenoids, detect greenhouses using WorldView-2 and Landsat satellite data, identify greenhouse crops, compute canopy heights, and estimate green vegetation fraction. Various approaches have been devised to analyze medium and fine spectral resolution data and maximize their use to extract specific information for vegetation biophysical and biochemical properties. Combinations of spectral bands, called indices, have been used to diminish the effects of soil background and/or atmospheric conditions while highlighting specific spectral features associated with plant or canopy properties. Vegetation indices (VIs) use the concept of band ratio and differences or weighted linear combinations to take advantage of the visible and NIR bands, two important spectral bands for vegetation studies, in measuring the photosynthetic activity of the plant and explore vegetation dynamics. There is an extensive list of such indices, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), ratio-based indices such as the modified simplerRatio, soil-distance-based indices such as the modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), and many others. Whereas most indices incorporate two-band or three-band relations ‚Äì slope-based, distance-based on soil line or optimized (slope-based and distance-based concepts combined) ‚Äì no approach deals with the raw shape of the spectral curve. MDI, however, investigates the shape of the reflectance curve using multiple spectral bands not considered by other indices, which could carry additional spectral information useful for vegetation monitoring. A full-waveform Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) system has the ability to record many returns per emitted pulse, as a function of time, to reveal the vertical structure of the illuminated object, showing position of the individual targets, and finer details of the signature of intercepted surfaces or the proportion of the canopy complexity. Information associated with the illuminated object can be decoded from the generated backscattered waveform, as key features of the waveform such as the shape, area, and power are directly related to the geometry of the illuminated object. The richness of the LiDAR waveform holds a promise to address the challenge of characterizing in detail the geometric and reflection characteristics of vegetation structure, e.g., the vertical canopy volume distribution. MDI utilizes the raw waveform and place importance on its shape and its return power. MDI departs from the usual Gaussian modeling in detecting peaks (canopy and ground) for example in canopy height estimation and focus more on the full geometry (raw shape) and radiometry (raw power) of the LiDAR waveform to retain richness of the data. The moment distance is a matrix of distances computed from two reference locations (pivots) to each spectral or waveform point within the specified range. Assume that a curve (reflectance or absorption curve or backscattered waveform) is displayed in Cartesian coordinates with the abscissa displaying the wavelength Œª or time lapse t and the ordinate displaying the reflectance œÅ or the backscattered power p. Let the subscript LP denote the left pivot (located in a shorter wavelength for the spectral curve and earlier temporal reference point for the waveform) and subscript RP denote the right pivot (located in a longer wavelength for the spectral curve and later temporal reference point for the waveform). Let ŒªLP and ŒªRP be the wavelength locations observed at the left and right pivots for a reflectance data, respectively, where left (right) indicates a shorter (longer) wavelength. Let tLP and tRP be the time value observed at the left and right pivots for a waveform data, respectively, where left (right) indicates an earlier (later) time. The proposed MD approach can be described in a set of equations. Moment distance index (MDI) schematic diagram for spectral reflectance curve (top) and LiDAR waveform (bottom). Note the number of points between pivots can vary. For spectral data, the index is given as: MDI = MD_{RP} - MD_{LP} MD_{RP} = textstyle sum_{i=lambda_{RP}}^{lambda_{LP}} displaystyle(rho_i^2+ ({lambda_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5} MD_{LP} = textstyle sum_{i=lambda_{LP}}^{lambda_{RP}} displaystyle(rho_i^2+ (i-{lambda_{LP}})^2)^{0.5} where MDI_{RP}is the moment distance from the right pivot, MDI_{LP}is the moment distance from the left pivot, {lambda_{LP}}is the wavelength location at left pivot, {lambda_{RP}}is the wavelength location at right pivot, rho_iis the spectral reflectance at a given wavelength, and i is successive wavelength location. For waveform LiDAR data, the index is given as: MDI = MD_{LP} - MD_{RP} MD_{RP} = textstyle sum_{i=t_{RP}}^{t_{LP}} displaystyle(rho_i^2+ ({t_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5} MD_{LP} = textstyle sum_{i=t_{LP}}^{t_{RP}} displaystyle(rho_i^2+ (i-{t_{LP}})^2)^{0.5} where the moment distance from the left pivot (MDLP) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the left pivot to the power at successively later times (index i from tLP to tRP): one base of each triangle is difference from the left pivot (i ‚àí tLP) along the abscissa and the other base is simply the backscattered power at i. Similarly, the moment distance from the right pivot (MDRP) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the right pivot to the power at successively earlier times (index i from tRP to tLP): one base of each triangle is the difference from the right pivot (tRP ‚àí i) along the abscissa and the other base is simply the backscattered power at i. MDI is an unbounded metric. It increases or decreases as a nontrivial function of the number of spectral bands or bins considered and the shape of the spectrum or waveform that spans those contiguous bands or bins. The number of bands or bins is a function of the spectral resolution of the imaging spectrometer or the temporal resolution of the LiDAR (digitization rate) and the length of the reference range (i.e., full extent or subsets of the curve) being analyzed.

The rivalry was a border rivalry, and was a long non-interrupted rivalry with 89 straight games from 1922 to 2010. With only 135 miles separating the two schools, Nebraska and Kansas State were the closest cross-border rivals in the Big 8 and Big 12 conferences. The 1939 contest between the two teams was televised in Manhattan, and it was only the second ever televised college football game. The 1992 contest was played in Tokyo, Japan, as the Coca-Cola Classic. The series is unusual for the fact that over the 100 years of this rivalry, there were 28 shut-out victories. Throughout the career of Nebraska coach Tom Osborne, Nebraska was undefeated by Kansas State. The rivalry began to heat up, however, when the Big 12 Conference was established in 1996 and Nebraska and Kansas State were both placed in the North Division, meaning that both schools were regularly in contention for the Big 12 North Division title. The last game between the two schools was played on October 7, 2010. There has been talk of scheduling non- conference games between the two teams to renew the rivalry.

Biography Betty Pino was born in Anc√≥n, Ecuador on 21 April 1948, but grew up, went to school, and worked in Quito. From an early age, Pino had an interest in radio and it became her dream to become an internationally recognized radio star. At 14, she made her first foray into radio at a local station in Quito. Around this time, Pino and her family immigrated to the United States of America and she found work as a maid in a luxury hotel and at a cafe. In 1973, Pino landed a job as a receptionist at a radio station in Miami, Florida and the next year became the city's first female DJ for WCMQ- FM. Years later, Pino arrived at Univision's Amor 107.5 FM and hosted a weekly music and entertainment show. Very quickly, she became very popular to listeners and many Hispanic artists and personalities and earned the nickname \\"La Reina de la Radio,\\" or \\"The Queen of the Radio\\" in Miami. Throughout Latin America, she became known as \\"La Gur√∫ del mundo del disco,\\" \\"The Guru of the Disc World,\\" for her ability to predict which songs would become a hit.

With over 1200 acres of possible old growth forest, this is a rugged area with a rich diversity of geology and plant life.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 The area is part of the Glenwood Cluster. Location and access Boundary for the White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain wildland as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 10 miles south of Glasgow, Virginia. The area is bounded by the Blue Ridge Parkway on the northwest and Va 602 (Hunting Camp Creek Road) on the east. Good access is gained from Va 602. The Forest Service has issued a document entitled \\"Motor Vehicle Use Map\\" dated January 1, 2015. The document is a set of 56 maps covering the George Washington and Jefferson National Forest. The maps show roads and trails in the forest and gives the type of vehicle allowed on each route with possible seasonal restrictions. The map covering the White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain area is included in the gallery below. Trails into the area include *Appalachian Trail (Thunder Hill Section), 1.3 mile section in wildland includes Thunder Hill Shelter. *Terrapin Mountain Trail, FS Trail 5, 3.0 miles, moderate difficulty, yellow blazed, *Hunting Creek Trail, FS Trail 31.0 miles, moderate difficulty, blue blazed *Glenwood Horse Trail, FS Trail 3004, 65.0 miles includes section in the wildland, moderate difficulty, orange blazed The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Map 789. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wildland's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable., Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain wildland is covered by USGS topographic maps Snowden, Arnold Valley, Sedalia, and Peaks of Otter. A key to the topographic maps for the northern half of the Jefferson National Forest is in the gallery below. Natural history The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. The wildland contains parts of two special biological areas, Apple Orchard Mountain and Camping Ridge. Special biological areas have large biological diversity with rare fauna and significant forest communities. There is a small track of old growth forest near Camping Ridge, and large tracts on and east of Onion Mountain. Much of the northern side of Terrapin Mountain and Camping Ridge between Camping Gap and the Thunder Ridge Shelter are at least 140 years old. The deep forests offer habitat for black bear, salamanders, trout, and other species dependent on this habitat. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.Virginia Stream Classification: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: June 18, 2017 Hunting Creek is ranked as a class ii trout stream. Topography The wildland is in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a province of the Appalachian Mountains. The area, dominated by Terrapin Mountain at an elevation of 3506 feet and Onion Mountain with an elevation of 3812 feet, contains large scree slopes and boulders as large as buildings. Rising from the Piedmont, the area has a 2800-foot elevation change as it ascends to the mountain crests. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine their potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. The White Oak Ridge-Terrapin Mountain wildland was not included in the inventoried roadless areas, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. To stop illegal motorized use, in 2010 the Forest Service blocked access to hill climbs in the area around Overstreet Creek. Two small areas on both sides of the ridge near the summit of Terrapin Mountain were burned in the Terrapin Mountain Fire of April 2010.

He is a former NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, having defeated Danny Hodge, and won the NWA World Tag Team Championship with Ron Bass in November 1975. He worked as the booker of World Class Championship Wrestling during its peak years and, as a promoter, formed the Wild West Wrestling promotion, which merged with World Class when he became part-owner in early 1988. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1970-1973)= Both Ken and his brother Johnny (who was also a professional wrestler) started amateur wrestling while in high school in California, before moving to Texas. Mantell began his career in Florida in 1970, wrestling under his real name. He established himself working for Championship Wrestling From Florida and soon began working the NWA Tri- State territory, where he won the NWA United States Tag Team Championship with Tom Jones on August 21, 1972, defeating Bobby Hart and Lorenzo Parente. The following year, Mantell wrestled for Big Time Wrestling in Portland under the ring name \\"Clay Spencer\\", where he captured the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship with Bull Ramos in July 1973. =NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion (1973-1975)= On December 19, 1973, Mantell faced six time and then- current NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion Danny Hodge in Jackson, Mississippi. Hodge, a 1956 Olympic silver medalist, had been champion for almost two years when he was defeated by Mantell, who went on to reign as World Junior Heavyweight Champion for the next year and a half. Mantell was a popular title holder and - as a world champion - defended the title throughout the National Wrestling Alliance. He feuded with wrestlers including Skandar Akbar in Kansas, Don Fargo in Utah, Bob Orton Jr in Fort Worth and Jack Lanza in Dallas. Mantell eventually lost the title to Hiro Matsuda in St. Petersburg, Florida on June 14, 1975. Danny Hodge would go on to defeat Matsuda for the title, becoming a seven-time champion. He retired as champion on March 15, 1976 after a car accident thus making Mantell the last person to ever defeat Hodge for the championship. =Tag Team success (1975-1976)= Five months after losing the World Junior Heavyweight Championship Mantell won gold again, when he and Ron Bass won the NWA World Tag Team Championship in November 1975. They defended the titles in the Central States Wrestling territory before dropping the belts in February the following year. Mantell then travelled to NWA: Georgia and again found tag team success, winning the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship with former WWWF World Tag Team Champion Dean Ho on July 2, 1976. =Heavyweight title victories (1976-1980)= Having been a junior heavyweight competitor for most of his career, Mantell competed as a heavyweight for the later part of the 1970s. He won the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship on October 15, 1976 in the Los Angeles territory, when he defeated Chavo Guerrero. The pair had a memorable rivalry for the Americas Championship for the following year, with Guerrero eventually recapturing the gold. Following this, Mantell travelled to the NWA Gulf Coast territory, where he became the NWA Gulf Coast Heavyweight Champion on March 22, 1977, defeating Wrestling Pro in Mobile, Alabama. Mantell and Pro would headline several events for the territory, feuding over the title in 1976-77, when Wrestling Pro eventually recapturing the championship in Dothan. Mantell captured his final title in wrestling on July 25, 1980 when he defeated Wahoo McDaniel in a tournament final to become the NWA Mid-South Louisiana Heavyweight Champion in Shreveport, Louisiana. =Booking for WCCW and the UWF (1980-1987)= Towards the end of his in-ring career, Mantell began to transition to a backstage role, working as a booker and valued \\"brainstormer\\" in the territory he was perhaps most famous for wrestling with; World Class out of Dallas and Fort Worth. Mantell was highly respected by the locker room and promoter Fritz Von Erich and was often thought of as Von Erich's \\"go to guy\\" after the passing of Fritz's son, David, in February 1984. In May 1986, Mid-South promoter Bill Watts set his sights on a national expansion in the same vein as Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation and Jim Crockett Promotions. One of his first acts was to hire Ken Mantell away from Von Erich's World Class, with the expectation that Mantell could bring across World Class fans and talent to the renamed Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). Mantell was successful and many former WCCW wrestlers would soon join the UWF, including the Fabulous Freebirds, Chris Adams, Missy Hyatt, Skandor Akbar, the Missing Link, Kamala and the One Man Gang. By the later half of 1986, the 1980s oil glut had hit Texas hard with many job losses in the WCCW markets of Dallas and Fort Worth, resulting in declining attendance at World Class events. A serious accident to WCCW's top star Kerry Von Erich kept him out of action for a year and a half, which effectively lead to World Class's major decline, only a few months out from still being a highly successful territory =Wild West Wrestling and ownership of WCCW (1987-1988)= It wasn't long before the oil recession hit Bill Watts in Oklahoma and he eventually sold the UWF to Jim Crockett in 1987. Mantell went on to form his own promotion based in the Dallas/Fort Worth territory called \\"Wild West Wrestling\\". Mantell continued on as a wrestler in Wild West, having notable feuds with wrestlers including Cocoa Samoa. The promotion was a direct rival to World Class, which still ran events in the area, albeit on a small scale than it had in its heyday. Wild West Wrestling merged with World Class in 1988 when Mantell became part-owner of World Class after Fritz Von Erich sold his once highly prosperous promotion to his sons Kevin and Kerry and to Mantell. Wild West was kept on as a syndicated television \\"B-show\\" to complement WCCW on ESPN. Wild West TV tapings, though, would become rare and often consisted of WCCW footage. Meanwhile, Crockett's circuit was sold to Ted Turner and eventually became World Championship Wrestling. By the early 1990s, Watts was the WCW president. The new era of World Class was to be short-lived. With WCCW unable to reach the heights it once had, the promotion was sold to Tennessee promoter Jerry Jarrett at the request of Kerry Von Erich. Ken Mantell has since largely retired from the professional wrestling business. His brother \\"Cowboy\\" Johnny Mantell is the current President of the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in its new location of Wichita Falls, Texas.

He was suffect consul for a nundinium in the first half of the year 161 as the colleague of Marcus Annius Libo.Werner Eck, \\"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit G√©za Alf√∂ldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam G√©za Alf√∂ldy, hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 80 His gentilicum Camurius points to a connection with the Trajanic equites C. Camurius C.f. Clemens.Attested at While some authorities believe Numisius Junior was descended from the equites, Olli Salomies in his monograph on Imperial Roman naming practices believes it is more likely he was adopted by a brother of Clemens than Clemens himself.Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), p. 100 A number of inscriptions with his name at Attidium in Umbria indicate that city was his home. One mentions a woman who might be his wife, Stertinia L.f. Cocceia Bassula Venecia Aeliana Junior, and a man who might be his son, Quintus Cornelius Flaccus [Stertinus?] Noricus Numisius [Junior?]. Anthony Birley believes his wife Stertinia was a descendant of Lucius Stertinius Noricus, consul in 113.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 255  Career  His cursus honorum can be reconstructed from one of the inscriptions at Attidium. Numisius Junior began in his teens as one of the tresviri monetalis, the most prestigious of the four boards that comprise the vigintiviri; assignment to this board was usually allocated to patricians or favored individuals. This was followed by a commission as military tribune in Legio IX Hispana, stationed in Roman Britain; Birley dates this to the 140s. Junior was afterwards appointed quaestor, which he discharged at Rome; about this time he was admitted to the sodales Titalis Flaviales. He then advanced through the traditional Republican magistracies of curule aedile and praetor. G√©za Alf√∂ldy estimates the date of this last office as around the year 150.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter den Antoninen (Bonn: Habelt Verlag, 1977), p. 336 After stepping down as praetor, Junior was commissioned as legatus legionis or commander of two legions consecutively. The name of the first is lost, but Alf√∂ldy dates his command from about 152 to about 155.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 302 The second was Legio VI Victrix, and Alf√∂ldy dates his command of that legion from immediately after leaving the first legion to around 158.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 299 It was an unusual situation for a man to command more than one legion; Birley offers a list of no more than 30 men who had done so, and he notes that \\"where evidence is available, special circumstances can be seen to have brought about the iterated command.\\"Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, pp. 18-20 Birley attributes the cause in Junior's case to the critical military situation in Roman Britain during the mid-150s. \\"It is not unlikely,\\" writes Birley, \\"that Numisius Junior had been commanding a legion on the Rhine, and was appointed to VI Victrix on the recommendation of Cn. Julius Verus, when the latter went from Germania Inferior to Britain.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, pp. 255f After concluding his command of the VI Victrix, Numisius Junior acceded to the consulate.

It produces about 1.1 volts per cell on discharge, and about 40 watthours per kilogram specific energy density. A silver-cadmium battery provides more energy than a nickel-cadmium cell of comparable weight. It has higher life cycle expectancy than silver-zinc cells, but lower terminal voltage and lower energy density.Thomas P J Crompton, Battery Reference Book third Edition Newnes, 2000 pages 5-5 through 5-7 However, the high cost of silver and the toxicity of cadmium restrict its applications. The first silver-cadmium batteries were developed by Waldemar Jungner around 1900, who used them in a demonstration electric car and whose company commercially manufactured the cells.Kevin Desmond, Innovators in Battery Technology: Profiles of 95 Influential Electrochemists McFarland, 2016, , pages 115-116 These original cells suffered from short life, and it was not until 1941 that an improved separator material was developed to prevent migration of the silver oxide within the cell.Davide Linden (ed), Handbook of Batteries Third Edition,McGraw-Hill, 2002 , pages 33.1 - 33.2 Renewed commercial development occurred during the 1950s, to take advantage of the better cycle life of the silver-cadmium system compared to silver-zinc. Like other silver-oxide battery systems, silver-cadmium batteries have relatively flat voltage during discharge. However, high-rate performance is not as good as for silver-zinc batteries. To preserve the operating life of cells, they may be shipped \\"dry\\" and the end-user adds electrolyte just before use. The positive electrode is made of sintered silver powder pasted onto a silver grid as current collector; the silver oxide may be formed in a separate process or may be formed on first charging of the cell. The cadmium negative electrode is formed of a pasted grid. Electrolytes are solutions of potassium hydroxide in water. Cells are provide with vent caps to prevent reaction of the electrolyte with carbon dioxide in the air. Theoretically as little of two grams of silver are required for each ampere-hour of capacity, but practical cells require between 3 and 3.5 grams. Because the charging voltage is higher than the discharge voltage, the watt-hour efficiency of a silver-cadmium cell is about 70%; ampere-hour efficiency is about 98%. The usual recommended charging method is constant-current charging at a 10 or 20 hour rate, (restoring the capacity of the battery over 10 or 20 hours), and cut off of charging at 1.6 volts per cell. Cells are commercially manufactured from 2 to 2500 ampere-hours capacity, but are often customized for particular uses.

Ozod was born in Khujand into the family of a merchant, and received her early education in the traditional schools before embarking on a career as a teacher. According to her own account of her biography as told through her poetry, she spent the entirety of her early life within the confines of Khujand, first in her family home and later in the house of her husband; she never even saw the outskirts of the city. It was only with the Russian Revolution that she first felt truly free, which was the reason she chose \\"Ozod\\" as her takhallus. She began writing poetry during World War II, composing patriotic works in which she urged warriors to fight on for the motherland. She continued writing after the war; notable works include Qahramoni Odil (Just Champion, 1943), Mahabbat ba Vatan (Love for the Country, 1944), Gulistoni 'Ishq (The Rose Garden of Love, 1946), Az Vodihoi Taloi (From the Golden Valleys, 1948), Iqbol (Fortune, 1951), and Zindabod Sulh (Long Live Peace, 1954). The theme of many of these later poems is the lot of women, especially in the time before the Revolution. Other work is dedicated to children. In 1944 Ozod joined the Union of Writers of Tajikistan; she died in Khujand. She was the mother of scholar Bobojon Ghafurov. Stylistically her verse has a simplicity reminiscent of folk poetry, although it reflects classical models as well.

He is best known for the historical atlas Lidai yudi tu, commonly called the Yangtu (\\"Yang's atlas\\"), the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. He devoted most of his life to the annotation of the 6th-century geographic work Shui jing zhu, which was completed by his disciple Xiong Huizhen and published as the Shui jing zhu shu. As a Qing diplomat posted in Japan, Yang purchased tens of thousands of ancient Chinese books from Japanese libraries and archives, many of which had become rare or lost in China. After his death, the government of the Republic of China purchased his collection and preserved most of the books in the National Palace Museum. Yang was an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School and became highly influential in Japan. The introduction of his art was said to have \\"offered virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style\\" to Japan and \\"revolutionized\\" Japanese calligraphy. Yang's former residence and tomb in Yidu, Hubei are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China. Biography Ê∏Ö‰ª£Â≠∏ËÄÖË±°ÂÇ≥, 1928) Yang was born in 1839, during the Qing dynasty, in Lucheng Town, Yidu County, Hubei Province. His courtesy name was Xingwu (). After passing the provincial examination and earning the juren degree in 1862 (first year of the Tongzhi reign), he lived for ten years in Beijing trying to pass the imperial examination for the highest jinshi degree, without success. Although he failed the examinations, he became friends with the prominent officials Pan Zuyin and Zhang Zhidong, who shared his passion for antiques. He attended Pan's lavish parties and shopped for antiques in Beijing's Liulichang with Zhang. From a young age Yang was interested in geography, and spent much of his life annotating Li Daoyuan's 6th-century work Commentary on the Water Classic (Shui Jing Zhu). His knowledge in geography earned him a diplomatic post to Japan, despite his repeated examination failure. In Tokyo he worked under the career diplomat Li Shuchang, an abrasive superior who nevertheless appreciated Yang's knowledge in antiques. As Japan was quickly westernizing during the Meiji Restoration, traditional Chinese publications fell out of fashion and were sold cheaply. Working with Li as well as Japanese antiquarians, Yang purchased tens of thousands of old Chinese books preserved in Japanese collections, many of which had become rare or even lost in China. They were later published as Guyi congshu (). After Yang's death, the Republic of China government purchased his collection and preserved most of his books in the National Palace Museum. Yang was posted in Japan from 1880 to 1884. After returning to China, he taught at the in Wuchang and then became dean of the Qincheng School (), later renamed as Cungu School (). In 1909 he served as an advisory official of the Ministry of Rites. He died in Beijing on 9 January 1915, and was buried in his hometown Yidu. Annotation of the Commentary on the Water Classic Yang devoted most of his lifetime to the annotation of the Commentary on the Water Classic (Shui jing zhu). He wrote 40 volumes of annotation but died before completing the work. His disciple Xiong Huizhen carried on the project and wrote another 40 volumes of annotation. It was published in the 1950s as the Shui jing zhu shu (). The influential historian Gu Jiegang remarked that the work \\"brought to a point of culmination the textual research of The Classic of Waterways of the previous three centuries.\\" He greatly admired the authors' \\"single-minded devotion\\" to the task, and Xiong's devotion to his master. Historical atlas of China Another of Yang's important works is the Lidai yudi tu (), his historical atlas of China which is often simply called the Yangtu (Yang's atlas). Yang began the work in 1866 with the assistance of Deng Yongxiu, and was joined by Rao Dunzhi in the late 1870s. They plotted historical geographical data on a Qing dynasty map, but left out non-Han Chinese kingdoms such as Nanzhao and Dali. Published between 1906 and 1911, it was the most complete and scholarly historical atlas of China produced during the Qing dynasty. Based on Yang's atlas, historian Tan Qixiang compiled The Historical Atlas of China, which was published in the 1980s and is considered the most authoritative atlas of Chinese history ever published. Calligraphy Yang Shoujing's calligraphy (1903) With the encouragement of Pan Zuyin, Yang became an accomplished calligrapher of the Stele School of Chinese calligraphy. When he went to Japan, he introduced the style to Japanese calligraphers, offering them \\"virtually an unprecedented aesthetic style\\" and revolutionizing Japanese calligraphy. He was considered a talented artist by famous Japanese calligraphers such as Miyajima Seiichiro, Kusakabe Meikaku, Iwaya Osamu, and Matsuda Sekka. and others bought hundreds of sheets of Yang's works. Yang wrote many essays on the Stele School of calligraphy, which were published by Japanese scholars in two volumes, Ping bei ji (, \\"Record of stelae criticism\\") and Ping tie ji (, \\"Record of model-letters criticism\\"). Memorials In September 1986, the government of Yidu city repaired Yang Shoujing's tomb and former residence, which was turned into the Yang Shoujing Museum. His residence and tomb are now protected as a Major National Historical and Cultural Site of China (designation 6-995).

Early life Rucker was born in Elmurst, Illinois, to Phil and Eva Rucker, a metalworker and housewife, respectively, and attended grammar school in Chicago. He majored in architectural drawing at Austin High School. Education and Early Career Rucker was awarded a scholarship to, and briefly attended, the Chicago Art Institute. Rucker received his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Architecture from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign in 1950; he then worked as a draftsman in Denver and San Diego before moving to Altadena and becoming a licensed architect. Rucker worked for various firms in the greater Los Angeles region, including architect Ray Jones of Glendale and architecture firm Gilman & Young of Brentwood. In 1957, Rucker opened his own Pacific Palisades firm as part of a partnership and in 1958, he opened his own, eponymous firm in Malibu. During the firm's tenure, Rucker primarily designed single-family, Post and Beam residences in Malibu; some projects were also located in Calabasas, Santa Monica, and Los Angeles. Though now retired from architecture, Rucker lives in California's Santa Monica Mountains. \\"Pedestal House\\" In 1966, he built his second house, the \\"Pedestal House,\\" on a Malibu promontory with the main floor sitting atop a forty-foot pedestal. Overlooking the mouth of Malibu Canyon and Surfrider Beach, the home featured views of the Pacific Ocean, Palos Verdes, the Serra Retreat, the Malibu Movie Colony and Catalina island. An architectural success, the house was featured in the Los Angeles Times, and was later included in the AIA‚Äôs Malibu Home Tour. On September 25, 1970, the house was destroyed by a brush fire, but two years later, Rucker constructed a new, fire-resistive home on the same foundation as the Pedestal House. This second house was also featured in the Los Angeles Times, and again made part of the AIA Home Tour. The house is currently listed in Gebhard & Winter's Guide to Architecture in Los Angeles and Southern California, alongside works by Frank Lloyd Wright, Frank Gehry, and other major architects.

He was the only son of Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th Baronet and Olga FitzGeorge, and was the heir to the Hamilton baronetcies of Trebinshun House and Marlborough House. FitzGeorge Hamilton's godparents were his great-grandfather, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, and the Duke and Duchess of York (later titled as George V and Queen Mary). His parents divorced in 1902, and during his adolescence he attended Hawtreys, Winchester College, and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. In 1917, FitzGeorge Hamilton was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, the regiment in which his great-grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge, also served. He served in World War I and was killed during an aerial bombing raid in Warlincourt-l√®s-Pas, France, in 1918. Following his father's death in 1939, the Hamilton baronetcies of Trebinshun House and Marlborough House passed to FitzGeorge Hamilton's uncle Sir Thomas Sydney Perceval Hamilton.  Early life and family  George Edward Archibald Augustus FitzGeorge Hamilton was born on 30 December 1898 in London. He was the eldest child and only son of Archibald Hamilton (1876‚Äì1939) and his first wife Olga FitzGeorge (1877‚Äì1928). FitzGeorge Hamilton was named for his maternal great-grandfather, Prince George, Duke of Cambridge (1819‚Äì1904), Commander-in-Chief of the Forces from 1856 to 1895; his paternal grandfather, Sir Edward Archibald Hamilton, 4th and 2nd Baronet (1843‚Äì1915); and his maternal great-uncle Colonel Sir Augustus FitzGeorge (1847‚Äì1933). He was given a double-barrelled surname composed of his parents' surnames. FitzGeorge Hamilton's baptism was held at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, which was attended by his sponsors the Duke of Cambridge; Prince George, Duke of York; and Mary, Duchess of York, his first cousin twice-removed. In 1900 a photographic portrait of FitzGeorge Hamilton with his mother, grandfather, and great-grandfather, entitled \\"Four Generations,\\" was published in multiple periodicals in the United Kingdom and the United States. FitzGeorge Hamilton had an unnamed sister who was born and died on 5 May 1902.  Childhood and education  FitzGeorge Hamilton seated on the lap of his mother Olga FitzGeorge (center) with his great-grandfather Prince George, Duke of Cambridge (left) and his grandfather Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge (right) in 1900. FitzGeorge Hamilton resided with his parents at Rotherhill House, west of Midhurst in Sussex. His parents divorced in 1902, and FitzGeorge Hamilton's father was assigned as his legal guardian. FitzGeorge Hamilton's mother remarried in 1905 to Robert Charlton Lane, and his father remarried in 1906 to Algorta Child. FitzGeorge Hamilton received his early education at Hawtreys (also known as St Michael's School) in Westgate-on-Sea, and then he attended Winchester College in Winchester from 1912 until 1915. Following the death of his paternal grandfather in October 1915, FitzGeorge Hamilton's father inherited the Hamilton baronetcies of Trebinshun House and Marlborough House and became titled as Sir Archibald Hamilton, 5th and 3rd Baronet; thus, FitzGeorge Hamilton became the baronetcies' heir apparent. Because FitzGeorge Hamilton had always intended to join the British Army, he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1916, following the completion of his studies at Winchester College. FitzGeorge Hamilton was among the college's successful examination candidates.  Military career  FitzGeorge Hamilton obtained a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards, an infantry regiment of the British Army, on 1 May 1917. His great-grandfather, the Duke of Cambridge, served as a Colonel of the Grenadier Guards from 1862 until his death in 1904. In late 1917, FitzGeorge Hamilton proceeded to France to serve in World War I with the Grenadier Guards. In January 1918, while in France, he joined the 1st Battalion as part of No. 4 Company.  Death and legacy  On 18 May 1918, FitzGeorge Hamilton's battalion suffered an aerial bombing raid by enemy aircraft in Warlincourt-l√®s-Pas, France. Three officers, including FitzGeorge Hamilton, were killed in this raid on 18 May, and another officer died on 19 May as a result of his injuries from the bombing. FitzGeorge Hamilton was aged 19 at the time of his death. According to family legend, the four officers had departed on leave, but returned to Warlincourt-l√®s-Pas to retrieve FitzGeorge Hamilton's leave pass which he had left behind. His commanding officer said of FitzGeorge Hamilton, \\"He was particularly keen in his profession and had all the makings of a really good officer and Grenadier. He was well liked by all, and will be greatly missed.\\" FitzGeorge Hamilton was subsequently interred at Warlincourt Halte British Cemetery near Saulty in grave XII.B.6. In June 1918, a memorial service was held for FitzGeorge Hamilton at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, where he had been baptized 19 years prior. Memorials were also erected in his honour within the \\"Outer G3\\" section of the Winchester College War Cloister, and at St Mary's Church in Iping, near Midhurst. FitzGeorge Hamilton was posthumously awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal. Following the war, FitzGeorge Hamilton's mother Olga gave birth to a daughter, Jane (4 June 191920 September 2014), with her second husband Robert Charlton Lane. His mother died in 1929, and in her will, she bequeathed a gold cup presented to FitzGeorge Hamilton by the Duke of Cambridge to the officers' mess of the 1st Battalion, Grenadier Guards. His mother also left ¬£1,000 to Winchester College for the establishment of the George FitzGeorge Hamilton Fund to assist in the education of the children of Wykehamists who had died in World WarI. FitzGeorge Hamilton's father Sir Archibald Hamilton sold his Iping House estate in 1919, and later converted to Islam in December 1923 and changed his name to Sir Abdullah Archibald Hamilton. He married his third wife Lilian Maud Austen in 1927, and she subsequently converted to Islam and changed her name to Lady Miriam Hamilton. Sir Abdullah Archibald Hamilton died in 1939 in Selsey, Sussex, and the Hamilton baronetcies of Trebinshun House and Marlborough House passed to his brother Sir Thomas Sydney Perceval Hamilton. Ancestry Through his father, FitzGeorge Hamilton was a grandson of Sir Edward Archibald Hamilton, 4th Baronet of Trebinshun House and 2nd Baronet of Marlborough House, and his wife Mary Elizabeth Gill. Also through his father, FitzGeorge Hamilton was a direct descendant of William Hamilton, one of the five Kentish Petitioners of 1701. FitzGeorge Hamilton was a great- great-grandson of both Admiral Sir Edward Hamilton, 1st Baronet (1772‚Äì1851) and Member of Parliament Panton Corbett (1785‚Äì1855) of the Corbet family. He was also a direct male-line descendant of James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Abercorn (1575‚Äì1618), and he was descended from James II of Scotland through his daughter Mary Stewart, Countess of Arran. Through his mother, FitzGeorge Hamilton was a grandson of Rear Admiral Sir Adolphus FitzGeorge (1846‚Äì1922) and his wife Sophia Jane Holden (1857‚Äì1920). He was a great-grandson of Prince George, Duke of Cambridge and his wife Sarah Fairbrother (1816‚Äì1890), and a great-great-grandson of Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge (1774‚Äì1850) and Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel (1797‚Äì1889). Because his maternal great- grandfather's marriage was in contravention to the Royal Marriages Act of 1772, FitzGeorge Hamilton's grandfather and great-uncles Colonel Sir Augustus FitzGeorge and Colonel George FitzGeorge (1843‚Äì1907) were ineligible to inherit the Dukedom of Cambridge.

With her husband Ernest Cognacq she created the La Samaritaine store in Paris, which grew into a chain of large department stores. Innovations included good lighting, clearly marked fixed prices, and allowing customers to pick out their own clothes and try them on before buying. The couple were active in philanthropic work, and gave out bonuses for large families during the population crisis that followed World War I (1914‚Äì18). Early years Marie Louise Ja√ø was born on 1 July 1838 near Samo√´ns, now in the department of Haute-Savoie. At that time Samo√´ns was in the Duchy of Savoy. She was born in the nearby hamlet of Villard. Her father was a mason and her mother a peasant. The family included five girls and three boys. As a child she helped look after a herd of goats. When she was 16 she was sent to stay with an aunt in Paris. She started as a salesgirl in a lingerie boutique, where she learned the trade. At the \\"Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse\\" store she met a young salesman a year younger than her named Th√©odore Ernest Cognacq. She then moved to Aristide Boucicaut's department store Le Bon March√©, where she became the first female salesperson in the clothing department. Ernest Cognacq When Marie Louise's future husband Ernest Cognacq was 12 his father was financially ruined and died. Ernest left school and began working as a travelling salesman between La Rochelle and Bordeaux. He then moved to Paris and worked in various stores, including La Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse, where he met Marie-Louise. In 1867 he opened a shop on Rue Turbigo, but it soon failed. He left Paris for a while, then returned to set up a stall under the second arch of the Pont Neuf. This had been the location of the Samaritaine hydraulic pump, which had been destroyed in 1813. He sold fabrics, towels and dish cloths on a counter made of crates covered in a red cloth. He was nicknamed \\"Napol√©on du d√©ballage\\" (Napoleon of the packing crates). By the time he was 30 he had saved up some money and was able to rent premises being used as a cafe at the corners of the Rue du Pont-Neuf and the Rue de la Monnaie. He called his new shop \\"Au Petit B√©n√©fice\\". The business prospered, and in 1871 Cognacq took a formal lease and hired two employees. La Samaritaine La Samaritaine at the corner of rue du Pont-Neuf and rue de Rivoli Ernest Cognacq hired Marie-Louise Ja√ø as his sales assistant, and they married on 17 February 1872. She added 20,000 francs to his savings of 5,000 francs. The couple worked hard and saved, and managed to buy the shop, now called La Samaritaine. Her interest in change and innovation complemented his business acumen. They were innovative, and also copied ideas from Le Bon March√©. New concepts included clearly marked fixed prices, and letting customers try on clothes before buying them. Eventually the couple managed to buy all the surrounding shops. Ernest Cognacq met the architect Frantz Jourdain in May 1883, a pioneer in iron-frame architecture and Art Nouveau. Jourdain redesigned the interior of the La Samaritaine store in 1891, and redesigned the couple's home on what is now Avenue Foch. In 1904 they had an iron frame building erected for them, lit by large windows. The store offered a wide range of goods and let customers pick out items themselves and take them to the sales desk. Further innovations included catalog sales and consumer loans. Between 1905 and 1910 they built four large stores. In 1905 Jourdain designed the second La Samaritaine store, which opened in 1910. It had a visible metal frame, twin cupolas, and a facade with panels of enamelled igneous rock. Sales rose from 800,000 francs in 1875 to 6,000,000 francs in 1882, 50,000,000 francs in 1898 and over 1,000,000,000 francs in 1925. In 1927 La Samaritaine had 8,000 employees. Marie-Louise Ja√ø died on 27 December 1925 in Paris at the age of 87. Ernest Cognacq died on 21 February 1928. They were succeeded by their adopted nephew, Gabriel Cognacq (1880‚Äì1951). By the 1990s the stores were no longer profitable and were sold to the LVMH group, which had already bought Le Bon March√©. They were closed in 2005. Philanthropy Ja√øsinia garden in Samo√´ns Marie-Louise created the Ja√øsinia botanical garden in her home town of Samo√´ns, opened to the public on 3 September 1906. It holds more than 5,000 plant species from five continents. She also built a house for a doctor who was housed at no cost in exchange for giving care to the needy. Ernest offered his home town the collections of a local scholar, which became the basis of Ernest Cognacq museum in Saint-Martin-de-R√©. Between 1900 and 1925 Ernest Cognacq and Marie-Louise Ja√ø assembled an important collection of 18th century art, which they meant to exhibit in their store La Samaritaine de luxe, opened in 1917. It included paintings, books and faience, and in 1928 was bequeathed to the City of Paris to become the Mus√©e Cognacq- Jay. From 1914 the employees were given shares in the company. 65% of profits were redistributed to employees, who also received benefits such as a free canteen. During World War I (1914‚Äì18) the couple created the Fondation Cognacq-Ja√ø, which was recognised as a public utility on 2 December 1916. The foundation's projects were often mostly for the benefit of their employees. It ran a nursery, convalescent home and nursing home in Rueil-Malmaison, a school in Argenteuil, a maternity clinic in Paris, an orphanage and nursing home in Haute-Savoie and alms-houses in Levallois-Perret. The couple were childless. In 1920 they gave the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise a fund of 100 million francs to reward 300 deserving large families each year in an effort to boost the birth rate after the war. In 1922 they added 16 million francs to reward parents aged 35 or older with six children.

Mayflower Pictures Mayflower Pictures was formed in July 1937 by German-born film producer Erich Pommer and British actor Charles Laughton. John Maxwell was on the board. They announced they would make three films, all to star Laughton ‚Äì Vessel of Wrath (1938), St. Martin's Lane (1938) and Jamaica Inn (1939). The films were all made. Jamaica Inn was the last film directed by Alfred Hitchcock before he left for America and marking the star debut of Maureen O'Hara, who was put under contract to the company. In March 1939 Mayflower signed a contract with Paramount for the latter to distribute four of their films in the US. The fourth film would be a version of The Admirable Crichton with Laughton, Elsa Lanchester and O'Hara There were also plans to make a movie about a journalist written by Bartlett Press. However the disappointing financial performance of the films saw the company lose its main backer, John Maxwell. Laughton went to America to appear in The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pommer went with him to negotiate American distribution rights for the films; after this, war broke out, and as a German passport holder, Pommer was unable to return to England. O'Hara, Pommer and Laughton all went to work for RKO. For a time, The Admirable Crichton was still discussed but the film was never made. Neither was another proposed project, a biopic of Dr Samuel Johnson. Mayflower Productions The company was re- activated in the late 1940s as \\"Mayflower Productions\\", the company of Maxwell Setton and Aubrey Baring. It made seven films, mostly action stories, before the company was dissolved. The company initially borrowed money from Rank or ABPC. In December 1951 Setton arranged finance from the NFFC and the Treasury Capital Issue's Committee to finance South of Algiers provided he could get a distributor guarantee. This meant Setton only had to get a guarantee from a distributor, not actually money. Setton and Baring ultimately parted ways after a differing of opinion of what films to make. Setton set up Marksman Films.

Early life  Ruddock was of Irish heritage and a freeholder of Ireland, a member of the Council House, and also a sheriff of the Bristol city council. Ruddock in his later years also became the vicar of Stockland.  Career  According to Nini Rodgers' book Ireland, Slavery, and Anti-Slavery: 1612‚Äì1865, Ruddock was Bristol's second largest slave trader. Ruddock was not only a trader in slaves, but like a lot of other traders at the time, he traded in tobacco as well. Ruddock paid for roughly 37 slave voyages varying from 1713‚Äì1731 according to numerous sources. After taking slaves from various different locations in Africa, like Bight of Biafra, Gulf of Guinea islands, West Central Africa and St. Helena. Ruddock went to a handful of different countries across the Atlantic to trade in slaves. Ruddock went to Jamaica thirteen times, Barbados eight times, Virginia six times, South Carolina four times, and St. Kitts three times to drop off his slaves. According to slavevoyages.org, Ruddock's ships carried 8923 slaves all together but only 7229 slaves survived. 19% of the slaves died which was higher than the 12% average of slave deaths during the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Nearing the end of the slave trade, Ruddock's earnings from the slave trade slowly dwindled. Eventually, Ruddock fell into bankruptcy and he fled to the West Indies. Shortly after his bankruptcy, the Council House removed him from the council because of a seven-year absence. Ruddock's brother-in-law Philip Harris (fl. 1715‚Äì1726) was also a prominent slave trader in Bristol, and together they owned the ship Triton in 1719.

A follow-up, The Best of Elmo 2, was released in 2010, followed by The Best of Elmo 3 (2015), followed by The Best of Elmo 4 (2018). Plot As Maria leaves the Fix-It Shop carrying a large board of wood, Elmo walks by and accidentally bumps into her, dropping a bunch of pictures from his hands. After Maria helps pick them up, Elmo reveals that he is bringing them to the Monster-Art-Show and wants his friends to help decide what picture is best; Maria notices one drawing with Ernie and Elmo. Maria tells Elmo that she likes the previous drawing the most, which Elmo ‚Äì to her surprise ‚Äì says that she can keep (as there are plenty more pictures to choose for the show). Maria spots another picture and asks where he got all his ideas; Elmo says that it is because of using his imagination, and Maria notices one drawing with Elmo in his imagination. Meanwhile, at Finders Keepers, Ruthie startles Elmo as he handles a Chandelle boa. After Elmo regains posture, Ruthie looks at his pictures and learns that he intends to display them at the Monster-Art-Show, which was where she had bought ten pictures. She notices two of his pictures, one of Elmo trying to scare Julia Roberts and one of Elmo sitting on a ledge while wearing tap shoes. Elmo assures Ruthie that there are many drawings left for the show, as the two look at a couple of more pictures. She finds one with the number 3 (from Elmo's number collection) and another with two backup singers. Elmo explains that the latter is about number 5, despite having no numbers on the picture. Now at the Park, Elmo has laid his drawings on the ledge, commenting about how he is already just given out a few of them. Zoe suddenly appears, sees Elmo's pictures, and asks if she can keep some of them, especially one with Telly and Elmo and one with Whoopi Goldberg and Elmo. Grasping the previous two pictures, Zoe notices two more ‚Äì one with a face and one with trees. Meanwhile, Elmo starts to feel annoyed as the number of pictures gets smaller, saying, \\"It's not easy being the best.\\" Zoe thanks Elmo and departs, taking the pictures that she likes. Elmo decides to pick the best drawing for the Art Show but finds that he has only one picture remaining. Elmo shows his last picture to the viewer ‚Äì one drawing of Elmo playing the piano. Elmo decides that it is time to pick the best drawing for the Monster Art Show, but finds that he just has the last picture remaining in his hand. He decides to hang it up at the show, but a blue Honker comes by, feeling upset and explaining that he has never gotten one of Elmo's pictures and feels left out. This leaves Elmo with a conundrum, asking the viewer what they would do. He realizes that friends' feelings are more important than a contest, and generously gives his last drawing to the Honker. However, now Elmo feels sad that there are no pictures left to enter before walking off. Then Elmo finds everyone gathered in front of 123 Sesame Street looking at his pictures and explains his problem. They all decide to give their pictures back, with Maria telling Elmo that he can return the pictures to them after the show. Elmo gleefully thanks them for their good deed, but now faces another problem: what picture should he pick for the show? Everyone laughs as Elmo asks the viewer what they liked best. As the credits roll, the pictures are shown on different frames against the pink background, including one drawing of Ernie and Elmo, one drawing of Elmo in his imagination, one of Elmo sitting on a ledge while wearing tap shoes, one of Elmo trying to scare Julia Roberts, one with two backup singers, one with the number 3, one with Whoopi Goldberg and Elmo, one with Telly and Elmo, one with trees, and the last one drawing of Elmo playing the piano.

In 1796, the 19th became the 69th Line Infantry Demi-brigade and the unit fought at the Battle of Mondov√¨, Battle of Castiglione and the Siege of Mantua. Having been promoted to first lieutenant Decouz joined the staff of Fran√ßois Rambeaud in 1797. He participated in the French campaign in Egypt and Syria where he fought at the Battle of the Pyramids in 1798 and was promoted captain on the battlefield. He was promoted again to chef de bataillon during the Siege of Acre in 1799. He became aide-de-camp to Jean Lannes and distinguished himself at the Battle of Abukir. Lannes sent him on an important mission to the Pasha of Syria after which Decouz became an adjutant lieutenant colonel. He then transferred to Louis Friant's staff as aide-de-camp. After his repatriation from Egypt, Decouz was appointed chief of staff of the 7th Military Division. At Grenoble he married a daughter of a former Paris justice of the peace. Empire =Regimental commander= In 1805 Decouz went to war as deputy chief of staff to Marshal Lannes. At the Battle of Austerlitz he had two horses killed under him and showed such valor that Emperor Napoleon appointed him colonel of the 21st Line Infantry Regiment. He assumed his new rank on 27 December 1805. His regiment was assigned to Charles-√âtienne Gudin de La Sablonni√®re's division. The 21st Line fought at the Battle of Auerst√§dt on 14 October 1806. In this action, Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps defeated the main Prussian army, inflicting 10,000 casualties and capturing at least 57 cannons. French losses were also severe: 7,000 men. Gudin's division was the first French division on the field at 7:00 am and fought alone until the second division arrived at 9:30 am. Decouz led his regiment at the Battle of Pu≈Çtusk on 26 December 1806. The 21st Line also fought at the Battle of Eylau on 8 February 1807. He became a Baron of the Empire on 27 November 1807. In 1809, his regiment fought at the battles of Eckm√ºhl, Ratisbon and Aspern-Essling. During the operations leading up to the Battle of Wagram, Decouz led the seizure of an island in the Danube River in which his men captured 600 Austrians, Colonel Saint-Julien and many artillery pieces. This feat earned him promotion to general of brigade on 12 July 1809 and the commander's cross of the Legion of Honor on 21 September 1809. =General officer= Decouz was transferred to Italy and entrusted by Marshal Joachim Murat with command of the port of Otranto. Later, Napoleon assigned him to watch over all ports of the Adriatic Sea. He was given command of the 3rd Brigade of the Army of Observation of Italy in 1811. About this time he was awarded the Order of the Iron Crown. Murat, the King of Naples wanted to be the godfather of Decouz's son but the general was recalled to France in October 1812. Napoleon appointed Decouz commander of the 1st Foot Chasseur Regiment of the Old Guard. Decouz fought at the Battle of L√ºtzen. In the Battle of Bautzen on 20‚Äì21 May 1813, Decouz was the only brigade commander in the 1st Old Guard Division, commanded by Fran√ßois Roguet. The division was made up of the 1st and 2nd Guard Foot Grenadier Regiments and the 1st and 2nd Guard Foot Chasseur Regiments, each including the 1st and 2nd Battalions, plus the V√©lites of Turin and Florence. Late in the afternoon of 21 May, the divisions of the Imperial Guard launched an assault against the Allies' position. On 4 August 1813 Decouz received promotion to general of division. In the Battle of Dresden on 26‚Äì27 August, Decouz led the 3rd Division of the Young Guard. Joseph Boyer de R√©beval's 1st Brigade included the 4th, 5th and 8th Voltigeur Regiments and Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau's 2nd Brigade was made up of the 9th and 10th Voltigeur Regiments. Each regiment consisted of two battalions. At 5:30 pm on the first day, Napoleon sent in the Young Guard divisions and they retook all the ground captured by the Allied attacks. During the night, Napoleon shifted the Young Guard from the center to the left flank where they pushed back the Allied right wing on the second day. Decouz is the second name in Column 17. At the Battle of Leipzig on 16‚Äì19 October 1813, Decouz led the 3rd Division in the I Young Guard Corps under Marshal Nicolas Oudinot. The 4,731-man division consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Voltigeur Regiments and the 1st Battalion of the 12th Voltigeurs. Boyer de R√©beval's 1st Brigade included the 5th, 6th and 7th Regiments while Pelet's 2nd Brigade was made up of the remaining infantry units. The 9th, 11th and 13th Young Guard Foot Artillery Companies and the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guard Train Regiment were attached to the division. Each of the three artillery batteries had six 6-pounder System Year XI cannons and two 5 ¬Ω-inch howitzers. At 2:00 pm on 16 October, Napoleon ordered a general attack and Oudinot's corps rolled south from Wachau toward Anenhayn. Though the Allies were pressed back, the hoped-for decisive victory eluded Napoleon. Under the direction of Oudinot he led the army's rearguard, fighting against Jean Baptiste Bernadotte's Swedes. Decouz's 2nd Young Guard Division with a strength of 2,840 men arrived at Nancy on 10 January 1814 and joined Marshal Auguste de Marmont's corps at Metz a few days later. By 18 January, the division had retreated to Verdun and on 24 January the troops were marching through Bar-le-Duc. On 25 January at Ch√¢lons-sur- Marne, Decouz's division included the 1st Brigade of Pelet and the 2nd Brigade of Auguste Julien Bigarr√©. Pelet's 1,313-man brigade was made up of the 5th and 6th Voltigeur Regiments while Bigarre's 1,387-man brigade consisted of the 7th and 8th Voltigeur Regiments. Each regiment had two battalions. Napoleon struck at Saint-Dizier, believing Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher's Allied army to be there. On 27 January, the French emperor found that he had missed the Prussian field marshal and directed his army southwest toward Brienne-le-Ch√¢teau in three columns. The Battle of Brienne was fought on 29 January. After some cavalry skirmishes, Napoleon ordered Guillaume Philibert Duhesme's division to attack Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev's Russians in Brienne. Duhesme's first assault was repulsed. Napoleon ordered another attack with Decouz's division on Duhesme's right. At this point, Duhesme's division was forced back by a Russian cavalry charge and a French brigade under Louis Huguet-Chateau seized the ch√¢teau, nearly capturing Bl√ºcher. The Prussian field marshal ordered Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken's Russian corps to clear the French from Brienne and Olsufiev to retake the ch√¢teau. In the event, Olsufiev failed but Sacken succeeded after desperate fighting. Decouz was mortally wounded and his successor Admiral Pierre Baste was killed. Decouz was shot twice in the chest. The first wound occurred early in the battle but Decouz refused to leave the field. The second wound proved fatal. Pelet became the division's acting commander until 11 February. Decouz died on 18 February 1814 in Paris. His name is on the east pillar of the Arc de Triomphe. Decouz is buried in the 22nd division of P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

The film tells the story of Jack Walker, a photojournalist whose life is devoted to uncovering harm done to the environment by industrial corporations, and his struggles to balance his family, his love life, and his activism. The film's subject matter is deeply involved with environmentalism, the ways in which the manufacturing industry exploits nature in order to make a profit, and environmental terrorism. Frieberg stated in an interview that the film's title refers to the conveniences of the modern world, and the trade-offs involved with having everything just a stone's throw away. A Stone's Throw marks the directorial debut of Camelia Frieberg, previously known for her producing work on films such as Exotica, and The Sweet Hereafter. Frieberg stated that she was inspired to write a film based on the premise that \\"there's very little in society that allows you to understand that each of your actions has a consequence ... on the planet, on other people, and on other species.\\" The film was shot in and around Frieberg's home in Halifax, Nova Scotia over the course of 15 days. At the 2006 Atlantic Film Festival it was awarded best Atlantic feature, and best sound design. The film received mixed reviews.  Plot  Photojournalist Jack Walker arrives at the Nova Scotia home of his long-estranged sister Olivia, the siblings discuss what has happened in their lives over the 8-year period since they last saw each other, such as Olivia's divorce from her husband Jean Marc. Jack and Olivia go and meet with Olivia's friend Lia, the local kindergarten teacher, and Jack expresses an interest in a factory in the town. Jack then goes to pick up Olivia's son Thomas from his father Jean Marc's house, and the two discuss Jack's work. Later, Jack reveals to Olivia that he has retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic degenerative eye disease. Jack says that it runs in their family, and that Olivia should get Thomas tested as well. He then says that the disease is the reason he had to quit his job, saying that he came to Nova Scotia so that Thomas could be tested as well. The two argue as to whether or not Thomas should be tested, as the disease has no cure. The argument devolves as Olivia asks why Jack missed their father's funeral, and Jack calls their father a murderer and walks away, saying he should go. After going on a hike the next morning with Lia, Jack makes up with Olivia. Thomas tells Jack that he believes that pollution from the factory is making his sisters asthma worse, Jack encourages Thomas to look into this theory. Thomas then asks his father if he knows anything about workers getting sick from harmful chemicals at the factory, Jean Marc, who works at the factory reacts angrily, saying that the factory is the first steady employment the town has seen in a while, and that a large part of the community works there. The next day, Jack helps out with the kindergarten class play, playing the piano as Lia directs. Afterwards, the two have sex. Later, Thomas then hears a knock on the door and goes downstairs, but before he can answer it Jack insists that Thomas not tell the person that he is there. Thomas opens the door and finds a police officer, who asks if he has heard from his uncle Jack lately, Thomas lies and the officer leaves. Jack reassures Thomas that the issue is just surrounding an unpaid parking ticket. Thomas then searches for his uncle's name on the internet, finding an FBI posting for Jack, stating that he is wanted for damaging and destroying industrial buildings at a mine in the United States with improvised explosives. Thomas then confronts Jack, saying that the internet is calling him an eco-terrorist, Jack responds by saying that the mining companies that use controversial mining techniques such as gold cyanidation are the real terrorists. Jack then reveals to Lia that he burned down the mine's office, and that his losing his sight to his disease motivated his crime, as he can no longer do his job, and he wants to be able to make a change before it's too late. Olivia discovers what Jack did at the mine, which turns out once belonged to their father, and kicks him out of her house. Jack goes to stay with Lia. Thomas, who has become obsessed with uncovering the extent of the pollution caused by the factory goes and trespasses onto the factory property and is subsequently arrested. After finding out about this, Jean Marc comes and threatens Jack, telling him to watch himself. Jack then sees Thomas stealing his truck, driving it to the factory, Jack and Olivia chase after him in Olivia's car. The chase ends abruptly as Thomas crashes Jack's truck into a deer. This causes Jack to come to the realization that what he has done is negatively affecting his family. The movie then ends with Jack and Lia confessing their love to each other as Jack walks into the police station to turn himself in.

A few weeks later, Finch gets Reese - who is now on a wheelchair temporally - a rented apartment. He also mentions that the building's super, Ernest Trask (David Zayas), is the newest number. Trask routinely tells elaborate stories about his supposed past, which Reese has a hard time believing are real. Finch states Trask has called antique shops that are known for possessing untraceable handguns. Finch hacks the security systems and then has Reese distract Trask on his apartment while he checks his office. He finds photographs of many women Trask has stalked. He leaves the apartment only to be spotted by Trask, who sends security guards after him. Using the security cameras, Reese helps Finch avoid the guards and flee safely. They initially suspect Trask is stalking the resident Lily Thornton (Kelli Barrett) and plans to kill her boyfriend Rick Morris (Bill Heck). However, Reese watches as Trask confronts Rick and makes an incident in order to set the fire alarms and force Trask to leave. Meanwhile, Carter (Taraji P. Henson) tries to communicate with Finch but finds his numbers disconnected while also continuing being followed by CIA agents. After losing the agents with Reese's fingerprints, Finch gets Carter to meet him in a restaurant. In order to show her the power of the Machine, Finch tells Carter that a worker is about to commit a crime. Finch soon discovers that Trask is not the stalker but Rick. Rick attacks Lily in her apartment until Reese and Trask arrive. Using his crutch, Reese manages to throw Rick out of a window, killing him. Finch and Reese also discover that Trask changed his name and his original records show him as the descriptions he gave to Reese as a friendly person. However, Reese soon begins to suspect Finch may not be entirely trustworthy.

The Kaper Koraon Treasure is a Byzantine silver treasure consisting of 56 individual silver items originating from Syria in the sixth and seventh centuries. History The treasure was re-discovered between 1908 and 1910. It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in Antioch, a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean. It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day Kurin, Syria or that the pieces belonged to a small local church. The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the Byzantine Empire subsequently lost this area of Syria to the Persian army. The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control. It is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and Christian artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many secular works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544. This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region. There is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague. Similar treasures have been found at Stuma, Riha, Hama, and Antioch to name a few. The objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious shrine gifts but were likely relatively cheap imitations made specifically for a village church. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of copper and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs. It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades. Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific donors of each piece. Notable pieces The Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight chalices, seven patens, five crosses, one cross revetment, two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other plaques. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples. Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the parish. Most of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation. Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of malleable metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece. Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an ewar, are likely original and occurred before the internment of the treasure. Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem. Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction. Since their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including The Walters Art Museum.

Global Perspectives. Retrieved 13 October 2017. He used the term to describe what he views as an emerging new era of economies and economics based on ideas, innovation, and creativity, which he sees as replacing economies which are based on the possession of natural resources. The word \\"indigo\\" was initially chosen based on the term indigo children, which has been used to describe people with unusual and innovative abilities. He describes the Indigo Era as a disruptive era driven by extraordinary levels of human creativity, where abnormally talented individuals and entities are able to realize new levels of human potential and economic achievement. It is \\"a new economic era where the main source of national wealth is no longer resource rent but the socio- economic infrastructure that allows every person to realise his or her intellectual or creative potential.\\" But, according to Fridman ‚Äì based on his observations of recent economic indicators, political and market volatility, and historical patterns ‚Äì it is also an era that will generate winners and losers as lagging countries and groups fail to adapt quickly enough. In late 2016 LetterOne's Global Perspectives journal published an Indigo Index, ranking 152 countries on their ability to compete and grow as economies move away from being powered by natural resources to being powered by ideas, creativity, and digital skills. In 2017 it launched the Indigo Prize, to award new concepts of economic measurement beyond mere GDP as countries in the 21st century transition into economies where innovation, creativity, and digital skills are economic drivers. The competition is intended to \\"stimulate debate about factors currently measured, given evolving economies, technology and skill bases, and what should now be taken into consideration in official economic statistics that measure the health, size and growth of a modern economy.\\" Indigo Era The economic term \\"Indigo Era\\" was publicized in early 2016 by Mikhail Fridman, the co-founder of the international investment business LetterOne. He used the term to describe the new economic era based on ideas, innovation, and creativity ‚Äì which he theorizes is replacing the previous era which he sees as defined by the struggle for natural resources and land that contains them, and which is measured by GDP.

He and other commentators also note the rise of populism and populist leaders and candidates, both right-wing and left-wing, as these changes occur.Greenberg, Stanley. \\"We Need a New Progressive Era of Renewal\\". Global Perspectives. Volume 1. November 2016. Meanwhile, companies like Apple and Google ‚Äì digital and technological companies he calls \\"Indigo companies\\" ‚Äì have replaced longterm traditional natural-resource or manufacturing companies such as Exxon as the world's largest companies. Fridman observes that throughout history innovations, alternatives, and technologies have always overcome any perceived shortages of any natural resource. He therefore posits that the new \\"Indigo era\\", fueled by digital and technological resources, will be marked by a shift away from the struggle for natural resources and their perceived scarcity, to a reliance on ideas, innovation, and creativity and on supporting the intellectual and creative potential of each human being: \\"The world has entered a new era where the source of a nation's wealth is no longer natural resources. Intellectual capacity has now replaced land, raw materials and trade routes as the biggest source of wealth.\\" According to Fridman, three interconnected factors are needed for successful Indigo companies and an Indigo economy: *intuitive individual talent and a high level of education, plus the ability to form a team of equally educated and gifted people *a sophisticated and complex ecosystem, which includes not only legal systems that protect physical and intellectual property rights and protection from takeover by larger companies, but also thousands of suppliers and subcontractors to supply high-quality services which range from venture capital to marketing to web design and other technologies and services *a global digital infrastructure to distribute new products and accumulate customer data and customer-behavior insight He notes that most emerging economies have focused on building physical structures (roads, buildings, cities, physical infrastructure) rather than the complex legal, political, and social systems, institutions, and changes that will support an effective free and innovative intellectual-resource economy. The freedoms, protections, and political and legal frameworks of developed Western countries rest on centuries-long histories, socio-political traditions, and mindsets, and therefore will be difficult to replicate quickly in emerging economies. Fridman singles out India as an emerging country that has adequate legal infrastructure and freedom to probably survive the Indigo shift. Fridman considers the growth of Indigo economies to be a paradigm shift; he states that the pace at which technology is developing is creating worldwide tectonic shifts, and predicts huge global change over the next five to ten years. He and other analysts predict that the growing economic gap between free, creative economies and groups in contrast to repressive, authoritarian, totalitarian, or tradition-bound economies or groups will widen and create resentment and hostilities ‚Äì whether this is between nations or within nations.\\"Editorial\\". Global Perspectives. Volume 1. November 2016. Those left behind may be either emerging countries, or the average person ‚Äì as opposed to the intellectual elites ‚Äì within developed Western countries. Authoritarian leaders and authoritarianism often rise during periods of uncertainty and insecurity and economic deprivation. Fridman maintains however that in this ever-changing new economic era, the main source of wealth in a country or region will no longer be a natural resource, but a social infrastructure that will allow everyone to realise their intellectual and creative potential. Therefore, he asserts that \\"The future Indigo economy is an economy of free people. And this means that the world will become more and more free.\\" In November 2016 LetterOne launched a journal, Global Perspectives, as a platform to explore \\"the new emerging economic era, the Indigo era, from different perspectives, including education, religion, politics, economics, history and business\\" and to examine \\"global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world\\".\\"The Global Perspectives Journal examines global issues through the eyes of leading commentators and business people around the world\\".

He was famous for his writings, including Jiu Guo Zhi, a history book on the Five Dynasties period. Biography Lu Zhen was a great-grandson of the Tang dynasty grand councilor Lu Yan. In the early 940s, his father Lu Xunmei () served as an aide to the Chu governor Ma Xigao () in Lian Prefecture (in modern Guangdong). Lu Zhen was born in 957 in Qiyang in Yong Prefecture (in modern Hunan), then ruled by the warlord Zhou Xingfeng; in 963 this domain would be incorporated into the Song dynasty territory. Before he was five Lu Zhen could already read Confucian Classics such as Classic of Filial Piety and Analects. When he was 11 his father died, leaving the family destitute, but his strict mother made sure he focused on his studies every day no matter the season. In 992 Lu Zhen passed the imperial examination. However, Emperor Taizong felt the exam was too easy and did not adequately cover ancient philosophical classics, so he gave the graduates another test question: compose a fu on \\"Zhiyan Richu\\" (ÂçÆË®ÄÊó•Âá∫; \\"Goblet Words Appear Daily\\"), an expression found in the Zhuangzi. Most of the hundreds of graduates could not remember the quote, but the studious Lu Zhen was the exception. His composition, which skillfully contained numerous classical references, was well-liked by the emperor. Lu Zhen's official career began as a case reviewer () in the Court of Judicial Review (), Vice-Prefect () of Bin Prefecture (in modern Shaanxi), and later Vice-Prefect of Xu Prefecture (in modern Jiangsu). He later returned to the capital Kaifeng to work in the Historiography Institute () with a concurrent appointment of \\"Companion for the Heir Apparent\\" (). In late 1000, he was serving as the Prefect of Bin Prefecture (in modern Shandong, a different prefecture than the one he stationed earlier), when the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty invaded from the north. One day, the Liao forces arrived outside the city gate, and locals began to panic. Some began to cry, knowing that Lu Zhen had no military experience. Lu Zhen comforted the people, and told them he would focus on the city's defense and not actively engage the much stronger enemy. After a few days, the Liao army withdrew. Liu Zong (), the fiscal commissioner () of Hebei Circuit, praised Lu Zhen in a report to Emperor Zhenzong. After he was recalled to the capital, Lu Zhen served as a judge in the Court of Judicial review and an aide in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices () before serving as Prefects first in Hezhong Prefecture (in modern Shanxi) and later in Deng Prefecture (in modern Henan). Some time between 1004 and 1007 he served as Pacif√≠cation Commissioner () of Fujian Circuit. In 1009 he was sent to the Liao dynasty on a diplomatic mission; his experiences were recorded as \\"Cheng Yao Lu\\" (‰πòËª∫ÈåÑ, \\"An Account of Riding the Carriage\\"). Lu Zhen was an alcoholic and died in late 1014 from an illness. During his later years he wrote the Jiu Guo Zhi, a history book on the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, but he died before he could finish it. His son Lu Lun (), who became a Master of Ceremonies () in the Court of Imperial Sacrifices () upon his death, added 2 chapters to the book.

The group was led by former FMW owner and the company's founder Atsushi Onita from late 1997 to mid 1998 and the group was based on World Championship Wrestling's New World Order (nWo). The group produced its own shows in collaboration with FMW like nWo promoted its own pay-per-view nWo Souled Out. Upon its formation, the group immediately wiped out W*ING Alliance and Funk Masters of Wrestling that had been dominating FMW for the past few years and was the lead villainous group formed by the unofficial merger of both factions. Their dominance ended when Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido turned on Onita after Onita lost a WarGames match to Hayabusa. The trio formed Team No Respect and ZEN turned fan favorites and feuded with TNR. The group was forced to disband after Onita lost to Kodo Fuyuki and the group disbanded on May 5, 1998. History =Feud with FMW= Atsushi Onita had been feuding with W*ING Alliance since 1994 and the group was formed with the concept of ending FMW because the group held Onita and his FMW responsible for ending W*ING. Onita concluded his rivalry with W*ING at Kawasaki Legend on September 28, 1997 by defeating W*ING Kanemura and the match stipulated that W*ING group would be forced to disband if Kanemura lost to Onita. As a result, the W*ING group disbanded. After the match, W*ING members Kanemura, Hideki Hosaka and Hido were worried because FMW or any other group would not accept them and Onita became concerned about them and then quit FMW in anger and took them under his wing. On September 30, Onita announced the formation of his new group ZEN with W*ING Alliance members and FMW's Tetsuhiro Kuroda defected to the group as well. The group was irate at Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Koji Nakagawa's leadership of FMW and replaced Funk Masters of Wrestling as the new lead villainous group of FMW and marked the first time that Onita became a villain in FMW. The group based itself after nWo by sporting black and white colors and rebelled against Shoichi Arai's FMW. On October 14, ZEN competed in its first match in which Onita, Hido and Kuroda defeated FMW's Hayabusa, Nakagawa and Tanaka to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship. ZEN also won the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship from Funk Masters of Wrestling's Mr. Gannosuke and Hisakatsu Oya on October 19, which led Gannosuke and Oya to join ZEN. On October 21, Gannosuke and Oya defeated Funk Masters of Wrestling's remaining members The Gladiator and Super Leather after Gladiator turned on Leather and disbanded Funk Masters of Wrestling for good. Later in the night, ZEN members Kanemura, Hosaka, Hido and Kuroda defeated FMW's team of Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka, Koji Nakagawa and Jinsei Shinzaki in an eight-man tag team match when Kuroda pinned Tanaka for the first time in his career. After the match, ZEN attacked their opponents until Gladiator showed up and delivered an Awesome Bomb to Hayabusa and joined ZEN by waving its flag in the group. In November 1997, Onita and Kanemura were forced to vacate the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship due to inactivity and Kanemura and Gannosuke brought the title back to ZEN by defeating Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka for the vacant title on November 28. Friction arose within ZEN after Hisakatsu Oya and Hideki Hosaka began screaming at one another. Oya quit ZEN after losing to Hayabusa on December 5 and Oya turned fan favorite by quitting ZEN and joining FMW, thus becoming the first person to quit ZEN. Also on the show, Tetsuhiro Kuroda earned a title shot at Masato Tanaka's Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and Independent Heavyweight Championship for pinning Tatanka on October 21 and Tanaka retained his Double Championship. =Feud with Team No Respect= More friction arose in ZEN following Hisakatsu Oya's exit as Gannosuke and Kanemura became upset at Atsushi Onita for booking his non-title match with the Double Champion Masato Tanaka to be the main event instead of Gannosuke and Kanemura's Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship defense against Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki on the December 19 show in the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour. ZEN competed in three matches at the event with Hideki Hosaka, Hido and Tetsuhiro Kuroda losing to Fuyuki-Gun in the opening match of the event while Gannosuke and Kanemura retained the title against Hayabusa and Shinzaki and Onita pinned Tanaka in the main event. Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido began separating themselves from Onita due to his selfishness and ego. The following night, on December 20, Onita, Hido and Kuroda lost the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and former ZEN member Hisakatsu Oya. On December 21, Onita, Hido, Hosaka (as The Great Fake), Kuroda and Gladiator lost to the ECW team of Terry Funk, The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer and Dudley Boyz. On December 22, a turning point took place in the history of ZEN when Onita, Gannosuke and Kanemura lost to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Jinsei Shinzaki in a Barbed Wire Baseball Bat Ladder WarGames match when Hayabusa pinned Onita following a Moonsault from the top of the cage, which he had failed to do at the 6th Anniversary Show. After the match, Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido attacked Onita out of jealousy until a mysterious man in a black jacket attacked them with a steel chair forcing them to retreat and leave ZEN. The man was revealed to be Koji Nakagawa, who had left FMW a week ago due to being upset with his position in the company and joined ZEN as the group's newest member. As a result of it, ZEN turned fan favorites and feuded with the new group of their former members Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido and the group became a four-man group with Onita, Nakagawa, Kuroda and Hosaka. On January 7, 1998, ZEN promoted its first show in the nWo Souled Out-themed format, in which Onita, Nakagawa and Kuroda defeated Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido. Fuyuki-Gun attacked ZEN after the match due to Kodo Fuyuki's hatred for Onita and then formed a team with Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido called Team No Respect. ZEN switched its battle from FMW to TNR. On February 13, Onita, Nakagawa and Kuroda defeated Gannosuke, Kanemura and Jado to win the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship at ZEN's second promoted show. After the match, TNR attacked the match referee Go Ito, forcing him to walk on crutches. This turned out to be a ruse as Ito turned on ZEN by attacking Nakagawa with his crutch in the back to cost Nakagawa and Kuroda, a Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship opportunity against Gannosuke and Kanemura on February 19. ZEN promoted its third show on March 13, on which they lost to TNR's Mr. Gannosuke, Horace Boulder, Hido and Yukihiro Kanemura. ZEN's fourth show took place on April 6, where ZEN lost to Gannosuke, Fuyuki, Hido and Kanemura in the main event. =Dissolution= A legitimate feud evolved between Onita and Fuyuki over backstage control on FMW as Onita wanted to continue the deathmatch style of FMW, which had brought success to the company while Fuyuki was trying to influence backstage by putting his emphasis on converting the FMW style into sports entertainment style based on American wrestling but it would be a disappointment for FMW because FMW had gained fame due to the deathmatch style. Fuyuki would win the support of the majority of FMW staff because most of the staff had been jealous towards Onita due to his notoriety as an egomaniac. The dominance of ZEN rapidly declined and TNR began growing in power. Onita's off-screen feud with Fuyuki developed into a match between the two at FMW's first pay-per-view Entertainment Wrestling Live, where Onita lost to Fuyuki, which stipulated that ZEN must disband if Onita lost to Fuyuki. ZEN lost the rest of its matches on the show as well; Hideki Hosaka lost to Hido, Koji Nakagawa lost a three-way dance to Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator and Tetsuhiro Kuroda lost to Horace Boulder and Super Leather. However, Onita, who was notorious for being \\"Mr. Liar\\" did not end ZEN as a show was already planned for ZEN on May 5 and he said that ZEN would disband if they lost to TNR on the show. Onita, Nakagawa and Kuroda lost the World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship to Kodo Fuyuki, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido, forcing ZEN to disband and FMW owner Shoichi Arai was forced to lick Go Ito's boots as a result of pre-match stipulation. =Post-dissolution= ZEN name officially ended but the group remained united even after its demise and continued their feud with Team No Respect as Onita wanted his revenge on Fuyuki for ending the group. On May 25, the former ZEN members lost to TNR's Hido, Jado, Kodo Fuyuki and Yukihiro Kanemura in a match stipulated that TNR would get to pick a member of Onita's alliance and they forced Hideki Hosaka to become their slave. The following night, on May 26, Hido, Fuyuki and Kanemura defeated Onita, Koji Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda with the same stipulation and picked Kuroda as their slave, which led to Onita and Nakagawa as the only remaining members of the alliance. On May 31, Onita and Nakagawa received a shot at Fuyuki and Kanemura's Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship, during which Nakagawa turned on Onita by hitting him with Go Ito's crutch and was revealed as TNR's planted mole in ZEN to destroy ZEN. Team Zero Team Zero was a short-lived spin-off of Atsushi Onita's ZEN, which was formed on August 21, 1998. Onita went on a leave of absence after the dissolution of ZEN because he felt that he was not being booked properly and he was enraged at putting over Kodo Fuyuki. After working a storyline in ECW, Onita returned to FMW on July 20 after Team No Respect attacked FMW President Shoichi Arai and Onita made the save for Arai with preliminary wrestlers Yoshinori Sasaki and FMW's veteran enhancement talent Gosaku Goshogawara as Mr. Pogo #2 (Goshogawara had been given the character by the original Mr. Pogo after Pogo retired from FMW in 1996). At Atsushi Onita Presents Liar, Liar, Onita, Arai, Pogo and Sasaki defeated Go Ito and Team No Respect members Kodo Fuyuki, Koji Nakagawa and Yukihiro Kanemura in a weapons deathmatch to release Onita's former ZEN teammates Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hideki Hosaka from TNR's slavery and retain Arai's post as FMW President. On August 21, Onita formed Team Zero with Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Hideki Hosaka, Mr. Pogo and Yoshinori Sasaki due to Onita's grudge with Fuyuki and his desire to fulfill the revenge. Team Zero's first match was a loss to TNR. The group began wearing kilts. On September 1, Team Zero defeated TNR in a match where they put their kilts on the line against TNR's briefs. Onita gained his revenge on Fuyuki by pinning him to win the match and TNR were no longer allowed to wear briefs due to the pre-match stipulation and Team Zero crucified their briefs after the match. TNR retaliated by stealing Team Zero's kilts.

Team Zero defeated TNR in a street fight on September 4. On September 29, Great Pogo defeated Mr. Pogo #2 to begin re-using Mr. Pogo while Mr. Pogo #2 reverted to using his real name Gosaku Goshogawara. Onita and Pogo restarted their historic rivalry and they concluded their feud in FMW on November 20, where Onita defeated Pogo in his farewell match to leave FMW. Onita had quit FMW because he was irate at being demoted from the company's ace to wrestle mid-card matches and FMW was not being a success without him, which led to his departure. On December 11, Onita and Yoshinori Sasaki defeated Team Zero teammates Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hideki Hosaka in a street fight to officially end Team Zero.

Kabuse tea is almost exclusively a first flush tea. Though kabuse tea is usually processed into a green tea after picking, kabuse tea denotes a pre- picking process and the freshly picked leaf can be used to produce any kind of tea, from green tea to oolong tea to black tea, etc. Background Kabuse tea leaves are used to produce one of the three most expensive Japanese green teas (the others are gyokuro and sencha). These teas are made from leaves that are hand-plucked and grown in the shade. Shade grown leaves produce superior quality green tea - ooika is the Japanese term for the \\"covered aroma\\" of these teas, which are high in theanine and other amino acids that contribute to their distinctive flavor. Kabuse is shaded for a shorter time than gyokuro- it is sometimes called a shade grown sencha. Studies have found considerable difference between the essential oils of kabuse-cha and sencha made from leaves grown in an open field. Kawakami and Yamanishi found that kabuse-cha contained large quantities of ionone series compounds. The kabuse tea process was created to mimic the shading effect of the tanakake tea process used in the cultivation of tencha which is in turn the base for matcha. The term kabuse tea is used for marketing purposes for an above average quality green tea. The covering process is distressing for the plant and can result in damage or disease if not applied and maintained with proper care.

The French stockpiled 266,000 French pounds of gunpowder for the siege and used less than half of it. Consumption of other material amounted to 34,000 pounds of lead, 27,050 cannonballs, 3,400 mortar bombs, 950 grenades and 12,000 sandbags. The financial costs were 89,250 French livres. After the garrison's capitulation, 6,000 peasant workers filled up the trenches. Under the terms of surrender, the Allied garrison marched off to freedom and was not taken prisoner. Of the 62 French engineers present, two were killed and seven seriously wounded. This demonstration of French military potency, combined with the successful storming of Barcelona the same year, convinced the Allies to come to terms with France in the treaty of Ryswick, thus ending the war. The siege was hailed by contemporaries as Vauban's masterpiece and the most efficient siege ever conducted, owing to its speed, low costs and the modernity of the eight-bastion fortress, which had been designed by Vauban himself 25 years earlier. Background When the War of the Grand Alliance broke out in 1688 the modern Spanish fortress of Ath stood on the sidelines of the fighting. The French armies of Louis XIV menaced the more important fortified towns of Brussels and Oudenarde, while leaving untouched the medium- sized Ath with its 6,000 inhabitants. Peace negotiations to end the war got underway in 1695 in Ryswick but the absence of a knockout blow on either side encouraged the participants to continue the struggle. When the Duchy of Savoy defected from the Grand Alliance in late 1696, Louis XIV saw that the time had come decide the issue on the Spanish Netherlands front. In mid-April 1697 French forces began the campaign and prepared to besiege the strong fortress of Ath to demonstrate France's military pre-eminence to the Allied negotiators. Prelude In 1540 Ath's medieval walls and ch√¢teau had been upgraded by the Spanish. Upon the French capture of the fort during the War of Devolution in June 1667 when the Spanish garrison fled the town without fighting, the walls were razed by Vauban in 1668. From 1668‚Äì1674 he replaced the ancient fortifications with eight new trace italienne angled bastions. In 1678 the modern fort was handed back to the Spanish as part of the Treaties of Nijmegen. The fort's curtain wall was surrounded by a ditch that made the top of the wall 30-feet high to someone standing at the bottom. When opened, a sluice gate added eight feet to the water's height, which was normally only several feet high. The bastions were within effective musket range of each other or no more than 600 feet apart. The bastions were separated by chevron- shaped outworks called tenailles located above the ditch. In front of the outworks were huge, triangular ravelin islands with masonry fortifications that could house hundreds of soldiers and several small-caliber guns. The outer wall of the ditch was known as the counterscarp, which served as the covered way around the fort. At Ath it was located 120 feet beyond the ravelins. The angled salients of the open-air walkway were usually the first to be captured but smaller re-entry angles between and behind the salients could be packed with dozens of troops to prevent the besieger from exploiting the capture of one section of the counterscarp. Two of the Ath bastions also had reinforced bulwarks in front of them for additional protection. The sloped glacis was the final piece of the outer perimeter. It presented the besiegers with murderous interlocking fields of fire from the defenders, who also had a double line of palisades at the top of the slope. A contemporary journal called Vauban's creation a \\"perfect model of the Art\\". The French engineer himself had given some thought to the matter of besieging the fort ever since he had designed it. The commander of the siege force, Marshal Nicolas Catinat and his chief engineer Marshal Vauban had a strong working relationship and would cooperate seamlessly during the siege. Catinat had 50 battalions and as many squadrons of cavalry, some 40,000 men in total. Vauban was assisted by Jean de Mesgrigny and 62 select engineers. Marshals Boufflers and Villeroi commanded the two covering forces, whose combined strength amounted to 140,000 men. The under-strength Allied garrison of 3,850 men was commanded by the lethargic 65-year old Comte de Roeux. Due to Roeux's frequent inactivity, command devolved to Anthony G√ºnther, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst. The Marquis de Conflans had been ordered to take command of the fortress' regiments but was captured by the French on 16 May before he could make the journey. The Allies had prioritized the more important forts of Brussels and Oudenarde and would be caught by surprise when the siege of Ath began. Investment A 12,000-man French cavalry force arrived before Ath on the morning of 16 May, securing all roads, river crossings, abbeys and buildings within a several-kilometer radius. Catinat's main force left Helchin the same day, crossed the Scheldt river and established itself in three camps about 10 kilometers from the fortress. The camps were separated by the Western and Eastern branches of the River Dender, which meet at Ath, and the French got to work setting up siege lines and regimental quarters and building bridges to facilitate communications. Boufflers' and Villeroi's armies took up covering positions on Catinat's flanks. Wealthy women inside the fort were let go by the French the same day. On 17 May, the Allied garrison indiscriminately burned down the buildings outside the fort to deny the French of cover and concealment, without giving any thought to the most likely French avenues of approach. They also failed to burn down the hedgerows and gardens, of which the French would make use. The Allies directed inaccurate cannon fire at the far too distant French camps. All of this was noted by Vauban, who concluded that governor Roeux was an incompetent. Civilian surgeons from the surrounding cities such as Valenciennes and Cambrai were conscripted to assist the French military surgeons with the wounded. 4,000 wagons were required to transport supplies and armaments and their civilian driver teams had to recruited from the region as well.

Leadership The current president of the NWSLPA is Tori Huster and the co-executive directors are Yael Averbuch and Brooke Elby. The 2020 executive committee consists of the following current players: Rachel Corsie, Emily Menges, and Nicole Barnhart. Awards The NWSL Players Association began awarding its own NWSL Players' Awards, voted on by the players of the NWSL, in 2019. These awards are considered one of the major end-of-season awards for NWSL players alongside the league's own awards. As there are often differences between the league's own awards and the NWSL Players' Awards, many NWSL players consider the NWSL Players' Awards to be more prestigious as they are decided by only players themselves. The inaugural edition of the NWSL Players' Awards included three categories: Players' Player of the Year, Players' Rookie of the Year, and Players' Team of the Year.
