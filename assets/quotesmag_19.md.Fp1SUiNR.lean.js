She was the first female professor at the Norwegian College of Agriculture. Early life and education Sundby, the daughter of Halvor Sundby (a farmer) and Wilhelmine Stokke, grew up on a farm in Hof in Vestfold County in the south of Norway. After passing her school matriculation examination in 1944, she first attended the National Gymnastics School (Statens gymnastikkskole) and then studied zoology at the University of Oslo, graduating in 1951. She immediately received a scholarship from the Norwegian Research Council for Science and the Humanities in order to investigate the causes of violent fluctuations in miner moth populations. She was given a position as research assistant at the University of Oslo in 1955. In 1958, she earned a doctorate for a dissertation which concluded the fluctuations of miner moth populations were mainly a result of parasitic wasps. Career Thanks to her doctorate, in 1958 she was appointed senior lecturer at the Norwegian College of Agriculture where she was charged with expanding the Department of Zoology. In 1969, she was promoted to full professor, the first woman to hold such a position at the college. In 1987, she became its first female Deputy Rector. In 1959, Sundby spent 15 months at the University of California working with Paul DeBach, an expert on biological (rather than chemical) means of insect control. Together they studied the effects of parasitic wasps on various insect pests. Their work led to Competitive displacement between ecological homologues (1963) which concluded that two or more species with similar ecological requirements cannot live together. When Sundby returned to Norway in 1960, her interest in biological control increasingly turned from research to conservation, as she came up with proposals for alternatives to chemical control. Sundby chaired the Norwegian Entomological Society twice: from 1954 to 1959, and from 1964 to 1967. She also became involved in environmental issues. From 1972‚Äì78 she chaired the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature (Norges Naturvernforbund) and from 1974 to 1989 she was a member of Statens naturvernr√•d (Natural Protection Council).

The essential difference between the two approaches is the choice of the auxiliary system (having the same density n(\\\\mathbf r) as the real, physical one). In Kohn-Sham DFT this system is composed by non-interacting electrons, for which the kinetic energy can be calculated exactly and the interaction term has to be approximated. In SCE DFT, instead, the starting point is totally the opposite one: the auxiliary system has infinite electronic correlation and zero kinetic energy. The Strictly-Correlated-Electron reference system To understand how the SCE system is constructed, it is useful to first think in terms of a simple example. Consider a collection of N identical classical charges (with repulsive Coulomb interaction) confined in some container with a given shape. If let alone, the charges will distribute themselves within the container until they reach the spatial configuration that minimizes their interaction energy (in equilibrium, their kinetic energy is zero). Of course, the equilibrium position of the charges will depend on the shape of the container. Suppose now that in this classical system one of the N charges, which we can label as number ‚Äú1‚Äù, is pinned at some arbitrary position \\\\mathbf r_1=\\\\mathbf r inside the container. Clearly, the equilibrium position of the other N-1 charges will now not only depend on the shape of the container, but also on the position \\\\mathbf r of the pinned charge. Thus, for a given confining geometry, one can write the position of the i-th particle (i=2,..,N), \\\\mathbf r_i, as a function of \\\\mathbf r: \\\\mathbf r_i=\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf r). In the SCE system, as in the classical example described above, the position \\\\mathbf r_1=\\\\mathbf r of a reference electron determines the position of the remaining ones. The analogue role of the confining container is now played by the condition that the density at each point must be the same as that of the real system, n(\\\\mathbf r): the electrons will always try to be as far apart from each other as possible, in order to minimize their repulsion, but always restricted by this condition. The positions \\\\mathbf r_i=\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf r_1) are called co-motion functions and play a fundamental role in the SCE formalism, analogue to the one of the Kohn-Sham single-particle orbitals in Kohn-Sham DFT . thumbrightSchematic figure showing the co-motion functions for a system of N=7 electrons in a harmonic confining potential. The reference electron is chosen as the one moving horizontally from the center of the dot to the right. The weight of each configuration (proportional to the density at the reference position ) is represented by the changing size of the dots. Calculation of the co-motion functions and interaction energy of the SCE system For a given density n(\\\\mathbf r), the probability of finding one electron at a certain position \\\\mathbf r is the same as that of finding the i-th electron at \\\\mathbf f_i[n](\\\\mathbf r), or, equivalently, n(\\\\mathbf r)d\\\\mathbf r = n(\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf r))d\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf r) . The co- motion functions can be obtained from the integration of this equation. An analytical solution exists for 1D systems, but not for the general case. The interaction energy of the SCE system for a given density n(\\\\mathbf r) can be exactly calculated in terms of the co-motion functions as V_{\\\\rm ee}^{\\\\rm SCE}[n]= \\\\int d\\\\mathbf s\\\\frac{n(\\\\mathbf s)}{N}\\\\sum_{i= 1}^{N-1}\\\\sum_{j= i+1}^N\\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf s)-\\\\mathbf f_j(\\\\mathbf s)} =\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\int d\\\\mathbf s \\\\,n(\\\\mathbf s)\\\\sum_{i= 2}^N \\\\frac{1}{\\\\mathbf s-\\\\mathbf f_i(\\\\mathbf s)} . Notice that this is analogous to the Kohn-Sham approach, where the non-interacting kinetic energy is expressed in terms of the Kohn-Sham single-particle orbitals. A very important property of the SCE system is the following one: since the position of one particle determines the position of the remaining ones, the total coulomb repulsion felt by a particle at a point \\\\mathbf r becomes a function of only \\\\mathbf r itself. This force can then be written as minus the gradient of some one-particle potential v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r): - abla v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) = F_{\\\\rm coulomb}(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\sum_{i=2}^N \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf f_i[n](\\\\mathbf r)}{\\\\mathbf r - \\\\mathbf f_i[n](\\\\mathbf r)^3} . At the same time, it can be shown that the potential v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) satisfies the relation \\\\frac{\\\\delta V_{\\\\rm ee}^{\\\\rm SCE}[n]}{\\\\delta n(\\\\mathbf r)}=- v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) . A promising route towards the application of the SCE approach to systems with general symmetry is the mass-transportation-theory reformulation of the approach . This is based on the analogies between the SCE problem and the dual Kantorovich problem . The SCE wave function is also very useful to set rigorous bounds for the constant appearing in the Lieb-Oxford inequality. Combining the strictly-correlated-electron and the Kohn-Sham approaches The one-body potential v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) can be used to approximate the Hartree-exchange-correlation (Hxc) potential of the Kohn-Sham DFT approach. Indeed, one can see the analogy between the expression relating the functional derivative of V_{\\\\rm ee}^{\\\\rm SCE}[n] and v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) and the well-known one of Kohn-Sham DFT \\\\frac{\\\\delta E_{\\\\rm Hxc}[n]}{\\\\delta n(\\\\mathbf r)}= v_{\\\\rm Hxc}(\\\\mathbf r) , which relates the Hartree-exchange- correlation (Hxc) functional and the corresponding potential. The approximation (which becomes exact in the limit of infinitely strong interaction) corresponds to writing the Hohenberg-Kohn functional as F[n] = T_{\\\\rm s}[n] + E_{\\\\rm Hxc}[n] \\\\approx T_{\\\\rm s}[n] + V_{\\\\rm ee}^{\\\\rm SCE}[n] , where T_{\\\\rm s}[n] is the non-interacting kinetic energy. One has therefore v_{\\\\rm Hxc}(\\\\mathbf r) \\\\approx - v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) and this leads to the Kohn-Sham equations \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2m} abla^2+v_{\\\\rm ext}(\\\\mathbf r)-v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r)\\\\right)\\\\phi_{i}(\\\\mathbf r)=\\\\varepsilon_{i}\\\\phi_{i}(\\\\mathbf r), which can be solved self-consistently. Since the v_{\\\\rm SCE}(\\\\mathbf r) potential is constructed from the exact properties of the SCE system , it is able to capture the effects of the strongly-correlated regime, as it has been recently shown in the first applications of this \\"KS-SCE DFT\\" approach to simple model systems . In particular, the method has allowed to observe Wigner localization in strongly- correlated electronic systems without introducing any artificial symmetry breaking . Other related density functional methods in the strongly correlated system The fractional quantum Hall effect(FQHE) is a strongly correlated system of general interest in the field of condensed matter. Previous DFT applications maps the FQHE to a reference system of non- interacting electrons, but fail to capture many interesting features of FQHE. The progress has been recently made to map the FQHE instead to a reference system of non-interacting composite fermions, which are emergent particles in FQHE. When a non-local exchange-correlation is incorporated to take care of the long-range gauge interaction between composite fermions, this DFT method successfully captures not only configurations with nonuniform densities but also topological properties such as fractional charge and fractional braid statistics for the quasiparticles excitations. This is a non-trivial example of how the DFT method can be applied to a strongly correlated FQHE system and provide numerical result comparable to those exact-diagonalization results. It opens a new line to attack the problem of FQHE through the popular DFT method.

He founded a society to promote counterpoint, and a music school for young singers. Early career Flowers was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, the fourth son of the Rev. Field Flowers. He studied music in Germany with Christian Heinrich Rinck and Franz Xaver Schnyder von Wartensee, and went on to graduate BMus from Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1839. In 1865 he obtained DMus. He was organist successively at the Chapel of the British Embassy in Paris, at St Mark's Church, Myddelton Square, and at St John's, Paddington. Contrapuntist's Society and publications Flowers founded the Contrapuntists' Society in 1843. In a letter to the Musical Examiner he wrote that the object of the society \\"will be the encouragement and promotion of a more scientific feeling in regard to music than hitherto has existed in England. My notion is ... that, to obtain admittance into the ranks of the society, a candidate shall compose a fugue, of at least one hundred and fifty bars in length, in each bar of which the subject shall be introduced.... A more generally scientific feeling infused among musicians, would go far to gain from them that respect from the members of other professions, which assuredly they do not now enjoy.... It will bring the most accomplished members of the profession together.... He was responsible for some contrapuntal and musical reviews in the Literary Gazette about that time, and was author of an analysis of John Goss's An Introduction to Harmony and Thorough-Bass in the Fine Arts Journal (1847, p. 445 et seq.). His Essay on the Construction of Fugue appeared in London in 1846. It was reviewed in the Musical World: \\"Mr. Flowers has fought most manfully in support of counterpoint and fugal compositions.... his object was to draw the attention of students to the works of Sebastian Bach and other classical writers.... The essay under notice is an endeavour on the part of Mr. Flowers to carry his point, by giving examples and musical illustrations. There are 44 pages... containing a vast amount of detail on the subject.... There are several fugues... all worthy of the best attention of students, to whom we recommend the essay.\\" His Pictorial Representation of the Science of Harmony, a translation of Basler's Reisekarte, appeared in 1850, and a poem on Muscular Vocalisation in 1861. Flowers introduced and developed Georg Joseph Vogler's system of progressive cadences. He contributed opinions on musical matters for many years to the Musical Examiner and Musical World. School of vocalization In 1850 (Musical World, p. 650) Flowers announced that he would cultivate and bring forward English vocal talent by means of a British school of vocalization. He later organized concerts for his pupils. One of the concerts, in the Hanover Square Rooms, was reviewed in the Musical World in 1852: \\"This gentleman, having devoted his attention to the study of the voice, and the philosophy of the art of singing, has founded a class of vocalization, from which he invites the public to anticipate the most important results. His first practical appeal consisted of an entertainment in which his pupils, under his own direction, performed a selection of music from the most classical master. There were choruses, duets and solos.... Of Mr. Flowers' system we are not yet enabled to give an opinion; but it is fair to state that he has discovered and brought forward some very remarkable voices.\\" The school of vocalization did not endure. Mrs Howard Paul may be cited as having been its most distinguished member. Compositions His compositions include organ fugues and choral fugues. His elaborate first mass, of about 1860, probably marks the date of his reception in the church of Rome. Flowers died of cholera on 14 June 1872.

After his graduation, he was gradually introduced to multiple public assignments in Jeddah, the western province of Saudi Arabia, where he was responsible for the development of Siemens Arabia and Nabors. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of San Diego, California in 1977. Al- Walid was also a graduate of Imperial College where he received a doctorate in neurosciences in 2012. His PhD thesis was entitled, \\"A Novel Algorithm for Detection and Prediction of Neural Anomalies\\". Sheikh Al-Walid developed great interest in brain theory. He launched multiple initiatives and programs that continue to serve and educate various sectors of the community and focus on the development and understanding of the human brain. Sheikh Al-Walid launched the brain forum, where his vision was to create a platform that would contribute to the progression of brain research and encourage global collaboration and initiatives with the potential to transform lives. Al-Walid successfully held a state of the art conference that was held in 2013, followed by a second in 2015 with over 1000 participants from 27 different countries. Following this, the conference became an annual event. In 2016, the brain forum hosted more than 1400 participants from 31 different countries. Sheikh Al-Walid is also fluent in four languages: Arabic, English, French, and German. Career Sheikh Al-Walid was also the chairman of Saudi American Bank, and wholly owned his own specialist Neuroscience company \\" NeuroPro\\". In 2005, he was appointed as chairman of Dow Chemical Arabia. In the same year he chaired the board of directors for Siemens Arabia and became the board member of Nabors (Oil and Gas). Sheikh Al-Walid has a 5% stake in Hitachi after investing $100m in the project through WJCO (Al-Walid Al Juffali Company) in January 2009. W Investments also had an 11% stake in Manchester United after purchasing the stake in May 2012. He was the chairman of E. A. Juffali and Brothers, a position he has held since at least 2005. In 2005, Al Walid was also chairman of Saudi American Bank as well as the Chairman of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry. In December 2005, the Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) announced that Juffali would host its entrepreneurial reality show, The Investor, which would be shown early in 2006. In her book Arab Television Today, Naomi Sakr, compared the show to The Apprentice, but noted that each of the 13 pairs of would-be entrepreneurs had to be from the same family, to reflect the \\"family aspect of business in the Arab world\\". Juffali also had a separate company, W Investments, a private wealth management company. The CEO is Jamil El Imad, who is also managing director and chief scientist of his NeuroPro company. Legal immunity On 9 November 2015, The Daily Telegraph reported that Juffali had gained legal immunity in the UK, having been appointed as St Lucia's \\"Permanent Representative\\" to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), which is headquartered in London. Two days later, St Lucia's Office of the Prime Minister issued a statement, confirming that Juffali was appointed to the role in April 2014, \\"that all necessary due diligence was done prior to the appointment\\", and it declined the request from his ex-wife's lawyers to \\"lift the diplomatic immunity of Dr. Juffali to compel Dr. Juffali to testify in the civil suit ... this is a civil matter in which it does not desire to get involved.\\" On 26 December 2015, The Daily Telegraph reported that it understood that the British Foreign Office had intervened to ask St Lucia to waive Juffali's immunity, amid concerns that he was using it to protect his wealth from his ex-wife during divorce proceedings. On 21 January 2016, The Daily Telegraph reported that the High Court had ordered Philip Hammond, the British Foreign Secretary to certify whether Juffali had been formally accepted by the UK as a diplomat representing St Lucia, as his ex-wife's lawyer stated that Juffali had never attended an IMO meeting. The judge lifted restrictions on reporting his ex-wife's claim that Juffali was seriously ill with cancer in a Swiss hospital since, if he were to die before the case is concluded, her claim would become irrelevant, and she and their daughter would receive no further monthly payments. In February 2016, the High Court dismissed Juffali's claim of diplomatic immunity as 'spurious'. Juffali appealed the judgment to the Court of Appeal, and was supported by an intervention from the Foreign Secretary. The Court of Appeal overturned the High Court's dismissal of Juffali's immunity, but ruled that his immunity was not relevant to the divorce claim, which it allowed to proceed. The divorce of Juffali and his second wife, Christina Estrada, was concluded in the British courts in July 2016 with Estrada being awarded ¬£75 million, the largest such settlement in English legal history. Politics Al-Walid was one of three Saudi Arabians who donated at least $3 million to the Clinton Presidential Center. Personal life Juffali's first wife was fellow Saudi, Basma Al- Sulaiman, who received ¬£40 million in a divorce settlement in 2000. They married in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 1980, where they lived in a marble palace. They had three children, one son and two daughters. (Dina, Hala, and Mohammed). Mohammed died on May 16, 2008, due to a Myocardial infarction. In 2001 Juffali married Christina Estrada, an American former Pirelli Calendar model, but they divorced in 2014. Estrada started divorce proceedings in 2012, after he married Loujain Adada (Saudi law allows up to four wives), and has made a claim against Juffali for at least his three UK properties, which include a seven-bedroom home in Knightsbridge, London, in a converted church, valued in total at about ¬£60 million. Juffali and Estrada have a teenage daughter (Sirina). Juffali also owned Bishopsgate House in Egham, Surrey, which he acquired from his parents in about 2001. There were \\"three butlers, six gardeners, five maids, two laundry girls, two drivers, two personal assistants, two nannies and an estate manager on the staff\\". Juffali's art collection, estimated at ¬£4 million, will be auctioned onsite at Bishopsgate House by Bonham's on 26 March 2018. In November 2012, Juffali married the 25-year-old Lebanese model and TV presenter Loujain Adada in Venice. Death On 20 July 2016, Al-Walid died in Zurich, Switzerland, after a lengthy period with cancer.

They were added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999.  History  Weeping Figs in Bourbong Street, circa 1890 Weeping Figs, circa 1911 Weeping figs, circa 1920 Weeping figs, 1954 The Bourbong Street Weeping Figs are four mature Ficus benjamina planted in the centre of the Road reserve in 1888, between Barolin and Maryborough Streets. Additional plantings were undertaken by the Bundaberg City Council in the 1920s. The first town survey for Bundaberg, situated on the Burnett river, was completed in 1869, ultimately establishing it as a service centre with harbour and port facilities for the agricultural and mineral produce of the area. During the following decade the sugar industry consolidated and a general economic boom in Queensland in the 1880s enhanced the local sugar boom. During the 1880s the Millaquin, Fairymead and Bingera sugar refineries were established providing the necessary infrastructure for the success of the fledgling industry. The sugar industry and the township of Bundaberg increased in both demographic size and political influence during the late nineteenth century, stimulating the demand for municipal landscaping that reflected this affluence. Municipal landscaping enhanced the streetscapes by adding character and dignity, also providing essential shade in the main business precinct of a city. Trees were also incorporated for the benefits to the health of the city, thought to assist in clearing of noxious smoke and fumes. The Ficus family were a popular choice for such plantings due to the dense foliage and broad spread of the canopy, which when planted in close proximity provided a continuous avenue of shade. The use of planting in the centre of the street, resolved the concern over the root system interfering with building foundations. Bourbong Street was gazetted two chains wide allowing ample room for two way traffic and centre plantings on the road reserve. The commitment of the Bundaberg City Council to urban landscaping was spasmodic, with resolutions for the planting of shade trees in Bourbon Street passed and rescinded twice in 1882. In August 1888, local business identity Frederic Buss, donated towards the planting of trees, as well as fencing and trenching of the ground to ensure that the project was undertaken. Trees were planted in Bourbong, Barolin, Maryborough and Woongarra Streets through this project. In the early 1920s additional trees were planted in Bourbong Street of the same variety as the original trees. Frederic William Buss, (1845-1926) migrated to Queensland in 1863 from Kent in England, establishing Buss and Turner department store in 1888 on Bourbon Street, Bundaberg. Buss's business empire expanded into commercial real estate and eventually he was to become an influential figure in the local sugar industry, including production refining and distilling in his portfolio of interests. Although he was active in local politics, taking his place in both the chamber of commerce and the municipal council, Buss declined to take a seat in the Queensland Parliament, instead concentrating on local affairs. The changing use of the road system from horse to car over the twentieth century saw the gradual erosion of the avenue of trees, resulting in the four trees between Barolin and Maryborough streets being the only remaining trees in the central business district of the once grander concept. Over recent years, these figs have suffered considerable stress. The open tree surrounds are considerably reduced, thereby restricting the root system form receiving adequate rainfall and moisture. The recent completion of redevelopment works in the central business district further reduced the open-ground plots provided for the figs.  Description  The Bourbong Street Weeping Figs are four mature Ficus benjamina planted in the centre of the road reserve, between Barolin and Maryborough Streets, Bundaberg. The trees are centrally aligned and mounted in a pebblecrete base allowing an open-ground plot of approximately one metre square. The trees are interspersed with double sided angle parking with identical pebblecrete treatment as the tree surrounds. The trees contribute to the general streetscape of the central business district which includes the School of Arts, former Commercial Bank, the Post Office, the War Memorial and Buss Park. Together the buildings, park and weeping figs form a distinctive precinct.  Heritage listing  The Bourbong Street Weeping Figs were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 July 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Bourbong Street Weeping Figs, located between Barolin and Maryborough Streets comprise four mature Ficus benjamina originally planted in the centre of the road reserve in 1888, with additional plantings in the 1920s. The trees demonstrate the affluence of Bundaberg as the centre of a thriving sugar industry in the late nineteenth century that is reflected in the addition of major street planting to the urban fabric of Bundaberg. Additional trees planted in the early 1920s, demonstrate the continuing commitment to civic landscaping by the Bundaberg City Council. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The trees dominate the streetscape and are integral to the aesthetic of the main commercial precinct of Bundaberg. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Bourbong Street Weeping Figs have a strong association with Frederic Buss, a prominent businessman, agriculturalist and municipal alderman, as an example of his generosity and commitment to the municipal development of Bundaberg.

The water contamination led to the suspension of water service in several cities that depend on water from the Doce River. This incident is considered to be the biggest environmental accident in the history of Minas Gerais. As a consequence of the disaster, the Brazilian government suspended the company's activities. In Brazil, Samarco/Vale was involved in the financing of dozens of political campaigns with contributions that reached R$80 million in just the 2014 general elections, and many of these same politicians are now tasked with investigating the company's responsibilities for the disaster and setting the amount of fines.UOL Not√≠cias: Deputados que v√£o apurar trag√©dia em Mariana receberam R$ 2 milh√µes da ValeBandeirantes: Proteste J√° In June 2016, Samarco had not accomplished any of 11 mandatory emergency actions, according to IBAMA.

Terry (11 February 1924 ‚Äì 25 August 2014)England and Wales births Retrieved 22 November 2015 was an English racing car designer and engineer, known for his work with Lotus, BRM and Eagle. He also designed chassis for many other teams, including ERA and Aston Martin and produced his own car in which he competed. Biography Terry left school at 14, with few qualifications, but with ambitions to become a designer and worked for a theatrical agency as an office-boy. Quickly promoted, after his colleagues were called up for military service, he produced promotional material for his company's clients. In 1943, Terry enlisted in the RAF where he served as an instrument maker. After completing military service, Terry trained as a draughtsman and this led to him being employed by a contract design company who seconded him to Aston Martin, where he worked on the DB2/4. In 1955, he began to race a one-off special, the JVT and subsequently designed his own car, which he named the Terrier. He worked briefly for ERA before joining Lotus in 1958, where he worked on revisions to the 7, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17 and Elite models. His Terrier sports car was not successful, but he teamed up with future Formula One engine builder, Brian Hart for the MkII version. In 1959, Hart won 18 races, out of 21 entered, regularly beating the Lotus entries and creating a demand for customer cars. This led to Terry being sacked by Lotus. At this time, Terry also supplied drawings for the Moorland Special which was purchased by the Gemini team and formed the basis of their Mk1 Formula Junior car. Lotus 38 at Goodwood 2010 Terry was then asked to design chassis for Gilby, initially for sportscar racing but subsequently for Formula One. Even though the car was tested by Bruce McLaren it was not raced by a top-line driver and the project ended when Gilby was taken over by a firm which was not involved in motorsport. At this point Terry's own part-time racing career came to an end after an accident. He was working on a freelance basis (including for Lotus) when Colin Chapman asked him to return full-time to design a car to compete in the Indianapolis 500. He produced the rear-engined Lotus 29 which, driven by Jim Clark, finished a close second at the 1963 Indianapolis 500 and the Lotus 34 for 1964 which, although starting from pole-position only completed 47 laps (out of 200) due to tyre and suspension problems. Terry later claimed that differences with Chapman meant the car had not been fully developed. He was also involved in the design of the Lotus 33 F1 car with which Clark won the Drivers' World Championship. For the 1965 Indianapolis 500, Terry was given full control over the design of the Lotus 38, and the car finished first that year, and second in 1966, each time with Clark driving. However, Terry left Lotus before the 1965 race, having already been recruited by Dan Gurney's AAR team to design a Formula One car. This led to the Eagle- Weslake V12, which has been considered one of the most aesthetic Formula One designs. Climax four-cylinder engine Terry was employed by Carroll Shelby to design a Can-Am car for 1967, but the project did not come to fruition: Terry was still based in the UK and could not oversee the development. Subsequently, he was recruited by BRM to design a Tasman Series car which became the BRM P126. Terry's next project was the BRM-engined Mirage M2 for John Wyer. It proved effective but its racing career was delayed by the continued success of Wyer's Ford GT40s. Terry's next design was a Formula 5000 car; intended as a privateer project it was taken up by Surtees and used by David Hobbs to finish second in the 1969 US Championship. This chassis also formed the basis of the BMW 269 and BMW 270 Formula Two cars in 1969‚Äì70. There followed another F5000 design, (named Leda) which was not successful, and the company formed to produce it passed into the hands of Graham McRae. Terry worked as a freelance designer on several projects, none of which were particularly successful before BRM asked him to design a Formula One chassis to accept their V12 engine. The result was the BRM P207 which competed in the World Championship in without scoring any points. This was Terry's last involvement with F1 design. He subsequently worked on several projects, within the industry, though away from motorsport, but did design the Viking Formula Three car. Personal life Terry had a mild stroke in 1993 and was largely retired thereafter. He was a keen cyclist and table tennis player and continued to assist Classic Team Lotus with restoration matters. Terry was married to Iris who died in 2008. He died in August 2014 aged 90, after a short illness.

It was built from 1882 to 1958. It is also known as Bundaberg Court House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 December 1998.  History  Bundaberg Court House, circa 1910 The former Bundaberg Police Station complex is located at the corner of Maryborough and Quay Streets and addresses Quay Street. The former Bundaberg Court House is a rendered masonry and timber building constructed between 1882 and 1884. The former lock-up keepers quarters, a single-storeyed brick and timber building and the lockup, a single-storeyed L-shaped brick building, were constructed in 1900 as part of a larger police complex that included the now demolished two storeyed brick Police Station. Bundaberg was first settled in the mid-1860s by timber cutters, with saw milling operative at Baffle Creek by 1866. John and Gavin Steuart secured a 320-acre land selection for timber and saw milling activities and other settlers followed. Leases for agricultural purposes followed the timber getting, with sugar plantations and maize cropping eventually taking precedence in the cleared areas. Agricultural settlement was encouraged by the Queensland government under the under the Coffee and Sugar Regulations of the 1860 Crown Lands Alienation Act. The first town survey for Bundaberg, situated on the Burnett River, was completed in 1869, ultimately establishing it as a service centre with harbour and port facilities for the agricultural and mineral produce of the area. During the following decade the sugar industry consolidated and a general economic boom in Queensland in the 1880s enhanced the local sugar boom. During the 1880s the Millaquin, Fairymead and Bingera sugar refineries were established providing the necessary infrastructure for the success of the fledgling industry. Thomas McIlwraith, Queensland Premier and Colonial Treasurer 1879-83 represented the electorate of Mulgrave, incorporating Bundaberg, during this period of growth. The sugar industry and the township of Bundaberg increased in both demographic size and political influence during the late nineteenth century, stimulating the demand for public buildings that reflected this affluence. The Bundaberg Court House was originally designed as a smaller timber building, however a larger brick building was the resultant design from the Department of Public Works and Housing, more befitting to the political importance and economic stature of Bundaberg. Bundaberg Court House was designed by George St Paul Connolly, acting Queensland Colonial Architect in the Queensland Department of Public Works. Connolly joined the Department in 1872 and worked on both public and private buildings, under the direction of Colonial Architect F.D.G. Stanley. In 1885 he was appointed Queensland Colonial Architect, a position he held until 1891. The Bundaberg Court House followed the \\"T\\" shape design developed during the nineteenth century. The major consideration in the design and planning of the Bundaberg Court House was the allowance for the correct movement of people in the building and the separation of the different groups involved in the judicial process. The verandahs at the rear of the building allowed for specific delineated entrances to the buildings. Jurors and barristers entered the court house by an alternative route to the public on their way to the public spaces. The judges had a private entrance and lobby via the rear verandah. The prisoners would be brought directly from the police cells to the court room through the side verandah door, from the nearby police reserve. Early Bundaberg Police Station (now demolished)In 1900 the police took occupation of the adjacent lots to the Bundaberg Court House, previously occupied by the Lands office and the Customs House and Bond Store. Police had occupied smaller accommodation adjacent to these sites, but separated from the court house. A grand two storey brick Police Station, a lock-up keepers residence and cell block were built providing for the close spatial relationship between the dual arms of justice administration that regularly operated in police/court precincts throughout the state. This proximity facilitated the movement of prisoners between the remand centre and the court proceedings, enhancing security and reducing risk of problems for police during the transfer form one justice venue to the other. In 1935 the Court House underwent extensions and renovations that included the addition of a strong room, and addition of extra office space and amenities for judges and jurors at the rear of the building. The office of the Clerk of Petty Sessions was enlarged by removal of two fireplaces and an internal wall. The 1950s heralded a boom period for the City of Bundaberg, with population growing by one third from 15,926 in 1947 to 21,235 in 1957. Advances had been made in the production and marketing of sugar where coupled with the development of the new Port of Bundaberg, the third in Queensland to operate bulk handling facilities. The new port opened in 1958 and was built downstream from the original wharves at Burnett Heads. This prosperity was combined with a general building boom that was reflected in the upgrading of various public buildings including the Bundaberg Court House. Architectural perspective from Quay Street of the 1958 court house In 1958 a new larger modern Court House was constructed in Quay Street, adjacent to the 1900 Police Station building and facing Anzac Park situated on the banks of the Burnett River. At this time the original court house was remodelled to accommodate the Police Service. The major alteration to the building was the reorganisation of the court room space to provide four new offices and the addition of a recreation room and other amenities at the rear of the building. Various out buildings including wash houses, toilets, motor garages, horse stables and bicycle sheds were also located on the site at this time. The aggregate police site included the 1882‚Äì1884 Court House, and the 1900 Police Station, lock up keepers residence, the cell block, providing a range of official and residential accommodation for the police service. Since the inception of the Queensland police force in the nineteenth century, the police lived and worked within the boundary of the police reserve. The former Bundaberg Police Station complex reflected the arrangement of the living and working conditions that still prevailed until the mid-twentieth century. The location of barracks and other quarters on the same site as the police station provided an obvious law and order presence within the Bundaberg community at all times. This arrangement provided public access to the police force both day and night. The lock up keepers residence was built as part of the original 1900 Police Station, maintaining the congruity of form and design in the combination of timber, iron and brick materials. The design was typical of turn of the century government accommodation incorporating two bedrooms, living room, kitchen, bathroom and front and rear verandas. In 1940 a charge room was added to the building and in 1962, a laundry and internal toilet were attached. As onsite residencies became redundant, the building was used for office space to complement the main Police Station housed in the former Court House. The original 1900 brick cell block consisted of six cells, with one padded cell and one larger communal cell. A concrete verandah with timber trim and balustrade ran the length of the building. A chain link stockade fence separated this area from the rest of the reserve and allowed for prisoners' exercise yard. In 1940, toilet and shower facilities were added at the eastern end of the building. A charge room was added to the building in 1952 and chain link wire was used to enclose the verandah portion of the cell block. The 1900 Police Station was demolished in 1985, government offices now stand in its place. In 1997, the Bundaberg court returned to the original court house while renovations of the 1958 building were undertaken. The central court room was refurbished when subdividing partitions were removed to reveal the original volume and detailing and it was restored to its original use. In 2015, the building is being used as the Cellblock Backpackers.  Description  The former Bundaberg Police Station Complex is a single storey rendered brick building, situated on the corner of Quay and Maryborough Streets and oriented towards the Burnett River. The building has a rectangular floor plan with a corrugated steel hipped roof behind a parapet which faces Quay Street and returns down the sides of the building to flanking verandahs that spring from below the soffit of the main roof and run down each side of the building. The eastern verandah is partially enclosed. The verandahs are supported on timber posts with decorated capitals and a vertical boarded scalloped valance to form a Tudor arch. The verandah originally ran across the rear of the building but has subsequently been enclosed when the rear of the building was extended. Several other stages of additions are evident. The principal facade is asymmetric about the main entrance and retains the original entrance doors and half light above and an extended masonry pediment over supported by round columns with Doric capitals. Two round headed double hung windows are located on the east side of the main entrance and are framed by piers with moulded capitals. To the west the building has been extended in replicated detail when a strong room was added in 1935. The architrave of the windows is in relief from the surrounding wall surface and has a hood mould and keystone over which springs off recessed piers with moulded imposts. The strongroom window has vertical bars and the other walls are blank. An entablature connects the pediment over the front entrance and returns down the sides of the building. Above this is a balustrade parapet with hour glass balusters. Original chimneys survive in the north eastern corner and at the rear of the building. Access to the building is via a central hall from Quay Street which has a pair of flanking offices on the eastern side. Original fireplaces exist in both these rooms. On the west side of the hall is a single room which was created in 1935 when the strongroom was added. The hall leads, via a single door, to the Court Room which has an extended wall height to create a lofty space. This has recently been refurbished when subdividing partitions were removed to reveal the original volume and detailing. French doors with semi circular over lights and three round headed double hung windows open onto the side verandahs. Over each opening to the verandahs are high level narrow casement windows. The ceiling rakes from the walls to a line with the collar tie of the heavy timber trusses. To the east of the Court House is a single storey brick residence. The original plan form of this building is an \\"L\\" with an attached square room at the rear that was originally the Charge Room. The building has hipped roofs which have wide eaves with exposed timber frame soffits and are clad in corrugated galvanised iron. It has a timber front verandah which has been enclosed. The verandah roof is contiguous with the main roof. The west side displays three double hung windows that have prominent hoods which have diagonal timber sides and corrugated iron roofs. A flat roofed brick addition has been made to the east verandah. Internally the building retains its original configuration with a main living room off the front verandah and three rooms down the western side with the Charge Room off the east verandah. The laundry addition is accessed down stairs off the east verandah. To the south and the rear of the residence and to the east of the former Court House is a single storey brick cell block. This building has a narrow \\"L\\" shaped plan form with a gabled corrugated clad roof and small high level barred windows on the north and east sides. A low pitched verandah with security screening is on the north side. The building was originally documented to have three four cells but appears to have been constructed with five. A charge room was added to the north west corner in the 1950s.  Heritage listing  The former Bundaberg Police Station complex was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 1 December 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Bundaberg Police Station Complex consists of a single- storeyed masonry building constructed in 1882‚Äì1884 and a single-storeyed lock up keepers residence and cell block constructed in 1900. The scale and form of the buildings demonstrates the importance of Bundaberg as regional service centre for the sugar industry and other primary production activities in the Burnett region. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The principal building of the reserve was used as the Bundaberg Court House from 1882 to 1958 and Police Station from 1958 to 1997, demonstrating the evolving patterns of justice administration, influenced by two distinct stages of prosperity in the history of Bundaberg and Queensland. The 1900 lock up keepers quarters and the cell blocks, remnants of a larger police reserve, demonstrates the close spatial and working relationship between the dual arms of justice administration. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Bundaberg Police Station Complex is aesthetically dominated by the former Bundaberg Court House, designed to operate with a grand street presence. The complex forms an integral part of a precinct of government buildings including the 1958 Bundaberg Court House and the 1985 Waldren building, providing an eclectic streetscape of modern and traditional buildings, with both grand and domestic scale. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Bundaberg Police Station Complex has a special association with acting Colonial Architect George St. Paul Connolly, of the Queensland Department of Public Works, as an example of his work during the 1880s. The former Bundaberg Police Station Complex has a special association with Queensland police and judiciary, demonstrating the evolution of work practices and the changing nature of the lifestyle specifically associated with police force employment in a major regional centre.

Early life Born in Lundhill, near Wombwell in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Hall left school at the age of eleven and began working underground at Darfield Main Colliery, lying about his age as legally only children twelve or older could work underground.David E. Martin, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.II, pp.148-151 Hall moved to Cortonwood Colliery in 1900, but was laid off in 1903 as the pit closed due to a fire. He began working as a \\"trimmer\\", transporting materials, at Wombwell Main, then returned to Cortonwood when it re-opened, becoming a collier at the age of twenty. Trade unionism Hall was active in the Yorkshire Miners' Association (YMA), and attended a 1915 conference in London on its behalf. He was influenced by David Lloyd George's speech urging increases in production and led attempts to achieve this at his pit during World War I. In 1916, Hall was elected as secretary of the Cortonwood branch of the YMA, then as the pit's checkweighman in 1917. He was also elected for the Labour Party to Wombwell Urban District Council in 1920 serving until his death. In 1922, colliery officials had him removed as checkweighman, as they objected to him holding the post jointly with his union position, but he was instead elected as a Safety Inspector. In 1925, he gave up his local posts to become full-time financial secretary of the YMA, and from 1930 also served on the executive of the Miners Federation of Great Britain, where he was known for occupying a middle position between communists and right-wingers. He served on the enquiry into the Gresford disaster, and was involved in rescue attempts in several other mine accidents. Hall was appointed by the Trades Union Congress as its delegate to the American Federation of Labour for 1932/33, and he took advantage of the opportunity to tour the United States; among other engagements, he spoke alongside F. D. Roosevelt. Back in the UK, he was one of the strongest opponents of George Alfred Spencer's Nottinghamshire Miners' Industrial Union, and his increased prominent led him to election as president of the YMA in 1939, following the death of Herbert Smith. Hall was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946, and retired in 1952.

The route starts out further up the valley as Denholme Beck, Hewenden Beck and Hallas Beck. Its waters are fed by Thornton Moor Reservoir, Stubden Reservoir, Doe Park Reservoir and Hewenden Reservoir. Harden Beck is an overflow channel of Glacial Erosion which was carved out during the last Ice Age. The section after the waterfall down to the bridge under the road to Wilsden, is locally referred to as 'The Hidden Valley.' Mapping lists Harden Beck as starting where Hallas Beck and Cow House Beck meet, but documents from Bradford Council and the Yorkshire Invasive Species Forum list the beck as starting at the dam head from Hewenden reservoir In his book, Chronicles of Old Bingley, Harry Speight says that the Beck does start at the confluence of Hallas and Cow House Becks and that Harden Beck was a dividing line in the parishes, deaneries and the Wapentakes.  History  In a book on the place names of West Yorkshire, Harden and Harden Beck are listed as Heredene, Heredenbroc and Hardenbrok which translates as either Rock Valley or Hare Valley Beck. In the Topographical Dictionary of England, Lewis describes the Beck as \\"powerful Harden Beck, which abounds with trout, runs through a hamlet, and propels the machinery of three worsted mills in which the greater part of the population is employed.\\" There were actually six mills on the beck; (from upstream down) Hewenden Mill, Bents Mill, Hallas Bridge Mill, Goit Stock Mill, Harden Bridge Mill and Beckfoot Mill. Hewenden, Bents and Beckfoot mills have all since been converted into private accommodation buildings. Hallas Bridge Mill was destroyed by fire. Goit Stock Mill was later utilised as a caf√© and ballroom. It too burnt down (in 1927) with no reports of casualties. Its chimney and flue are still extant, with the chimney being built on the northern ridge to aid the dispersal of smoke from the narrow valley. Harden Bridge Mill is still in private use as a printers. Hewenden Reservoir was built as a compensation reservoir for the mill owners on Harden Beck who demanded a structure of its type when the Bradford Corporation started abstracting water from Manywells Spring to their reservoirs, away at Chellow Dean.  Description of route  The watercourse starts at the eastern edge of the A629 Keighley to Halifax road in Denholme. Here, several springs feed Denholme beck which flows into Doe Park Reservoir. Doe Park is also fed by Stubden and Thornton Moor reservoirs via Stubden Beck. The outflow from the reservoir flows northwards into Hewenden Reservoir, where it in turns flows north eastwards as Hewenden Beck as far as Hallas Bridge where it becomes Hallas Beck. On entering Goit Stock Wood, the course becomes Harden Beck at the confluence of Cow House Beck and Hallas Beck. Form here it flows mostly eastwards with Midgram Beck and Mytholmes Beck joining the course adjacent to Ruin Bank Wood. The Beck skirts the northern edge of Shipley Golf Course, through the ford and then under the bridge at Beckfoot before joining the River Aire in Bingley.  Bridges  Hewenden Viaduct is to the immediate north east of the dam head of Hewenden Reservoir and was built by the Great Northern Railway in 1884 and after the railway closed became part of the Great Northern Trail. Hallas and Goit Stock have footbridges. There is a bridge over the beck by The Malt Shovel Public House in Harden which links Harden village with Wilsden. This bridge is a Grade II listed structure from the 18th century. Where the Beck curves between Ruin Bank Wood and Harden Grange is a Grade II listed footbridge. The footbridge is on the north west corner of Shipley Golf Course and was listed in 1974. Another Grade II listed crossing is Beckfoot Bridge. It was listed in 1974 and spans the beck just before it enters into the right fork of the River Aire in Bingley. The bridge here dates from at least 1723 and is a Packhorse Bridge. There is a ford adjacent as the bridge is only wide enough for a single horse. The ford is deceptively deep and the water is fast flowing. People have had their vehicles washed downstream whilst trying to cross here and it would be unwise to cross, even in a 4 x 4.  Ecology and environment  The beck flows through Goit Stock Wood, which is known for being a good example of broadleaf woodland. The water cascades over Goit stock waterfall which is high. The waterfall was known as Hallas Lumb until the early 1820s when its name was changed to Goit Stock. The beck has seen pollution over its history, but trout and crayfish have been observed in the water. Goit Stock Woods and Harden Beck are listed as an SEGI (Site of Ecological and Geological Importance) by Bradford Council. The beck is subject to the invasive plants of Himalayan Balsam and Japanese Knotweed in a 0.5 km section upstream of Harden Beck Bridge in Harden village. In 2017, the weir at Beckfoot Mill was removed in the central portion to allow grayling to navigate upstream. As the mill is now private dwellings, its goit was no longer necessary and as the weir was a barrier to fish passage, it was cut open.  Navigation  The beck is not navigable to boats at any point. The reservoirs upstream are deep and wide enough to allow boating, although there is no evidence of this on Hewenden Reservoir.  Literary connections  Harden Beck was home to John Nicholson, The Airedale Poet, in the early nineteenth century. He was often out walking alongside the beck, looking for inspiration. He is said to have written many works beside the beck and by Goit Stock Waterfall, which he often visited in the dead of night. In 2012, as part of the Ilkley literature festival, the walk alongside Harden Beck became part of the Stanza Stones Poetry Trail. Developed by poet Simon Armitage and Tom Lonsdale, the walk takes in across moorland and water to inspire walkers.

Located near the banks of the Penobscot River, the site includes both evidence of habitation, and of funerary remains. The stratified site has dated elements as old as 3,000 BCE, and undated finds that are probably older. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The Eddington Bend Site is located on a terrace overlooking the Penobscot River, not far from the former location of the Veazie Dam, at a point in which the river bends sharply to the west. The river is described at this point as having a particularly fine and well-known salmon pool. The site includes a bluff on the river bank that is subject to erosion, and is composed primarily of sandy soils topped by a plow zone. Most of the site's important features have been found in the top of the site. These features include pits and trenches, whose uses are conjectural. The trenches contain a great deal of fire-cracked rock as well as evidence of post holes, and are theorized to have been used as drying racks or roasting sites for fish caught in the river. The function of the pit features is not known due to a lack of diagnostic features. The site also contains a cemetery, in which significant number of human remains were found, buried with red ochre. The site has been of archaeological interest since the early 20th century, and was first formally investigated in 1926 by Walter Smith. More recently, it underwent investigation and excavation in 1984 and 1986. The site has been damaged by agricultural activity, industrial works related to the Veazie Dam, and the actions of illegal amateur pot-hunters.

It was written and directed by Kenton Hall and stars Scarlet Hall, Hero Hall, Colin Baker, Ewen MacIntosh, Sarah Warren and Kenton Hall. It received a limited UK cinema release on 21 August 2015. Plot Maisie and Daisy McCormack are two, ordinary twelve- year-old girls trying to make their way through the minefield of life in the 21st century. Which, as far as their concerned, is largely a case of trying to work out why grown-ups behave so oddly on such a regular basis. When they interrupt a children's adventure story in progress, by scaring off the Narrator, they hijack the film and proceed to tell the story of their own lives, through the lens of the movies they've seem. Jacqueline, their mother is a struggling model with an idiosyncratic parenting method. Henry, their father, a writer who has sacrificed more than they realise to give them a stable home life. Maisie and Daisy lead us through their day-to-day life -battling bullies Jennifer, Audrey and Beth and the pull of first love -Matty Archer, the school heartthrob for Maisie and, unbeknownst to Daisy, her best friend Samuel for her. They take us through bad dates with Jacqueline, home- life with Henry, school life (with added were-wolves and vampires), before finally being forced to take the first tentative steps into adulthood when Jacqueline finally settles down and they decide to set their father up with their teacher, Miss Walters. And they need to do it all before the story they interrupted re-asserts itself. It's a race against time -and Maisie and Daisy are learning it's not necessarily a race they can win. And, in the end, that might not be such a bad thing after all.

Ranju is considered one of the best singers the revue has had in the recent years, and was selected to record songs for many of Takazuka's albums, both while she was with the revue and after she \\"graduated\\" from Takarazuka Revue. After her \\"graduation\\", Ranju began to actively pursue a career on stage, focusing mainly on musicals; but she can also been seen on television, playing supporting roles and as co-host of the monthly TV show \\"Takarazuka Dream Tours\\".  Early life  Tomu Ranju was born Mayu Sakamoto (Èò™Êú¨ÁúüÁî±) in Nishinomiya, Hyogo, a city in the same prefecture as the city where the Takarazuka Revue is based and got its name from. Sakamoto started to take ballet classes at the invitation of her friends while she was in elementary school, and has been dancing ever since. In eighth grade she heard about the revue for the first time and became interested. On her off days she would take morning trains to Takarazuka to line up for same-day tickets for shows. She was particularly fascinated by Mizuki Oura's (Â§ßÊµ¶„Åø„Åö„Åç) performances - who was famous for her dance skills, and also a Flower Troupe otokoyaku top star. Sakamoto continue to go to Takarazuka performances, but it wasn't until she was in high school that she decided to try out for the extremely competitive entrance exam of the Takarazuka Music School, known for low acceptance percentage. In 1994, a year for record low acceptance percentage of only 2%,http://blog.xuite.net/natashawo/wo/133293500-%E8%98%AD%E5%AF%BF%E3%81%A8%E3%82%80-+%E5%AF%B6%E5%A1%9A%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%92%E6%98%A5%E7%9A%84%E5%85%A8%E9%83%A8 Sakamoto was admitted to the Takarazuka Music School with the highest score. Throughout her 2 years at the music school, she maintained the status as No. 1 pupil (all Takarazuka students and actresses are considered \\"pupil\\" until they leave the revue, regardless of their seniority, popularity and stature).  Takarazuka Revue Career  In 1996 Sakamoto graduated as top of her class, and successfully joined the revue. By tradition, pupil would have already decided on her stage name (subject to revue approval), and switch to be addressed by it now. Sakamoto began to be billed as Tomu Ranju. The stage name was suggested by her teacher and family. The first name \\"tomu\\" was going to be written in kanji as \\"‰∫∫Â§¢\\", which means giving people dreams; but the kanji was considered too complicated, so it was changed to Hiragana form \\"„Å®„ÇÄ\\". The last name \\"Ëò≠ÂØø\\" is the kanji form of \\"l'ange\\", French for \\"angel\\".http://takaraduka.net/hanagumi/tomunamae/ Following Takarazuka customs, she also has couple of nicknames (given by fellow Takarazuka actresses and fans): Tomu („Å®„ÇÄ), Mayu („Åæ„ÇÜ), Rantomu („Çâ„Çì„Å®„ÇÄ). Ranju debuted in Can-Can, after that she was assigned to Flower Troupe. In addition to minor roles in regular revue productions, she was also cast for minor roles in novice productions and dinner shows. In 2001 she began to be cast for lead roles in novice productions. In 2002, she won her first lead role in the revue's Bow Hall production of Tsuki no Hokage, sharing the lead role of Jiroukichi with Ayabuki Mao. In the same year, Ranju won the Newcomer of the Year award. In 2005 Ranju won the Best Effort of the Year award. In 2006, she had her own first dinner show Sensation!, further fortifying her rising popularity and singing skills. In the same year, she was reassigned to Cosmos Troupe as third lead otokoyaku. In 2007, as Y≈´ga Yamato was promoted to Cosmos top star, Ranju was promoted to second lead. In February 2009, Ranju was cast in the lead role for another Bow Hall production Phoenix Wright (ÈÄÜËª¢Ë£ÅÂà§ -Ëòá„ÇãÁúüÂÆü), based on the Capcom legal thriller video game Ace Attorney. The production was so well-received that the revue presented a sequel, Phoenix Wright 2 (ÈÄÜËª¢Ë£ÅÂà§2 -Ëòá„ÇãÁúüÂÆü„ÄÅÂÜç„Å≥„Éª„Éª„Éª) just six months later. These 2 productions greatly boosted and attested to Ranju's popularity and her talent, leading to her first Takarazuka concert \\"R\\"ising!! in 2010. In 2011, as Sei Matobu retired, Ranju was re- assigned back to Flower Troupe as the next otokoyaku top star. She debuted as top star in the Takarazuka production of Phantom. During her 3 years as top star, it was considered that Ranju did well to carry on the tradition of Flower Troupe as \\"otokoyaku treasure\\" and \\"Flower Troupe of Dance\\". Retired top star Kazuho So was second lead under Ranju before being re-assigned to Snow Troupe as top star, and retired Cosmos top star Manato Asaka was third/fourth lead under Ranju before her re-assignment to Cosmos as second lead. On October 8, 2013, Ranju announced in a press conference that she will retire in 2014. Her farewell production was The Love of the Last Tycoon / Takarazuka Dazzling Dreams, a musical/show based on The Last Tycoon by F. Scott Fitzgerald. On May 11, 2014, after the last performance of The Love of the Last Tycoon / Takarazuka Dazzling Dreams, Tomu Ranju officially retired and became an \\"OG\\" (old girls, referring to retired Takarazuka actresses).  Career After Takarazuka Revue  Like most graduated Takaruzuka actresses, Ranju chose to continue on with her career using her Takarazuka stage name. Ranju's post-Takarazuka activities are focused on musical, dinner shows and concerts, but there are also television drama supporting roles and variety show appearances . Her relationship with Takarazuka Revue remains close, and was chosen to participate in 2 of its centennial celebration events: recording Reijin, an album with other otokoyaku OGs; and singing in the celebration concert of the post-mortem 90th birthday of Fubuki Koshiji, a Takarazuka OG from the 1940s with legendary stature in Japanese entertainment history.  Theater  Ranju's first non-Takarazuka appearance is the musical \\"ifi\\", a show focuses on showcasing various dance styles. She had a busy 2015 - 2016, balancing 2 stage productions while participating in various Takarazuka 100th anniversary special performances, leading roles in \\"The Love Bugs\\" and \\"Sister Act\\".  TV  As one of the \\"Sentinel Tops\\" (the 5 troupe otokoyaku tops), Ranju made numerous TV talk show and variety show appearances. She also did some narrating jobs for Sky Stage (Takarazuka's own TV channel) programs. Ranju's first TV drama appearance was a supporting role in Netflix's first Japanese production Atelier, playing an influential Vouge-ish magazine editor. She will next be seen in :ja:ÁßÅ ÁµêÂ©ö„Åß„Åç„Å™„ÅÑ„Çì„Åò„ÇÉ„Å™„Åè„Å¶„ÄÅ„Åó„Å™„ÅÑ„Çì„Åß„Åô (literally translated to \\"It's Not that I Can't Get Married, But I Don't Want To\\"), a TV drama about the \\"lost dogs\\", attempting to understand why successful and beautiful women prefer to stay single. Ranju plays one of the female lead character's friends, a successful financial adviser who's over 40, happily single, and has a younger boyfriend. In March 2016, Ranju co-hosted pilot for \\"Takarazuka Dream Tours\\" with veteran entertainment show host Shinsuke Kasai (who is an avid Takarazuka fan). The pilot was picked up by Fuji Television, and in June it became a monthly show. The show is shot 100% on location, interviewing the special guest while she's doing an activity she's always wanted to do but haven't had the chance. All special guests are Takarazuka OGs, many top star OGs have appeared in the show, including Ranju's top musumeyaku (Â®òÂΩπ, Takarazuka actresses who play female roles) Ranno Hana, Jun Sena, Sei Matobu, Kazuho So, Natsuki Mizu. After she got married in 2016, Ranju announced that she will be taking a break from acting. Her last public appearance was attending the premier of Ocean's Eight in Japan, as she played Danny Ocean in Takarazuka's musical version of Ocean's 11.  Personal life  During her Takarazuka years, following the \\"Sumire Code\\" (a set of rules that was established to enhance and protect Takarazuka actresses, so they would appear to be fairy-like, beautiful, mystical idols), only generic \\"revue-approved\\" information about Ranju was officially available. Ranju is one of the OGs who likes her privacy, and continued to adopt this attitude towards sharing information about her private life after she graduated. Her blog on Ameba is the only official social media that the public is aware of, and it's maintained by herself. On September 28, 2016, Ranju posted a blog announcing that she has just gotten married. Initially no information was available on her husband. But in 2017, with the announcement that Shuzo Matsuoka's eldest daughter was accepted to enter Takarazuka Music School, it was revealed that Ranju's husband is a cousin-by-marriage to Shuzo Matsuoka - making her a member of the Kobayashi family that founded Takarazuka Revue (Shuzo Matsuoka is a direct decedent of Ichiz≈ç Kobayashi)  Takarazuka Revue  Flower Troupe 1996 - 2006 *1996: Can-Can/Nightless Castle in Manhattan *1996: How to Succeed *1996: How to Succeed, as Coffee Boy & Tackaberry (Novice Production) *1996-97: Hong Kong Nocturne (Bow Hall) *1997: Hollywood Babylon/Southern Cross Revue *1997: Hollywood Babylon, as Mike Taylor (Novice Production) *1997: The Labyrinth of Loving You!

The moves came after a series of events that included a hunger strike by a student and a boycott by the football team. The movement was primarily led by a student group named Concerned Student 1950. The movement and protests were documented in two films, one made by MU student journalists and the other, 2 Fists Up, by Spike Lee. While it is alleged that bad publicity from the protests has led to dropping enrollment and cutbacks, others have cited budget cuts issued from the state legislature. Background In 2010, two white students dropped cotton balls in front of the Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center. They were arrested and charged with tampering, which is a felony, and which was prosecuted as a hate crime based on evocation of the historical slur \\"cotton picker\\" to describe enslaved or sharecropping blacks. The prosecutor asked for them to serve 120 days in jail, but they were eventually only convicted of littering, which is a misdemeanor, and sentenced to probation and community service, with no jail time. In 2011 a student was given probation for racially charged graffiti in a student dormitory. The events led to the creation of a diversity initiative called \\"One Mizzou\\" under MU chancellor Brady Deaton. This initiative was discontinued in 2015 owing to concerns that it had lost its meaning. University of Missouri student Jonathan Butler at a Planned Parenthood rally at the University of Missouri in September 2015 On September 12, 2015, a Facebook post by the student government president Payton Head described bigotry and anti-gay sentiment around the college campus, which gained widespread attention. He claimed that in an incident off campus, unidentified people in the back of a passing pickup truck directed racial slurs at him. \\"For those of you who wonder why I'm always talking about the importance of inclusion and respect, it's because I've experienced moments like this multiple times at THIS university, making me not feel included here.\\" Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin called the incident \\"totally unacceptable\\" on September 17.  Protests  A Concerned Student protester in the commons area, November 11, 2015 The first student protests occurred on September 24, 2015, at an event called \\"Racism Lives Here,\\" where protesters claimed nothing had been done to address Head's concerns. On October 1, a second \\"Racism Lives Here\\" event was held with 40‚Äì50 participants. An incident involving a drunken student on October 4 gave rise to more racial tensions. While an African- American student group, the Legion of Black Collegians, was preparing for Homecoming activities, a white student walked on stage and was asked to leave. Supposedly, while departing the premises the student said, \\"These niggers are getting aggressive with me\\", according to the LBC. This prompted chancellor Loftin, traveling outside the US, to record a video message in response and to release a statement that said, \\"Racism and all prejudice is heinous, insidious and damaging to Mizzou... That is why all of us must commit to changing the culture at this university.\\" Later that month, the student group \\"Concerned Student 1950\\" was created, referring to the first year the University of Missouri admitted black students. On October 24, a police officer responding to a property damage complaint reported that an unknown vandal had smeared feces in the shape of a swastika on a bathroom wall in a dorm on campus. The university's Department of Residential Life filed photographs of the fecal smear in a hate crime incident report, and the residential life director emailed a number of people on campus, including a Hillel organization, to request information about anti-Semitic activity on campus. The investigator in the university's Title IX office, noted in an email that the swastika may have been \\"meant to offend and threaten a larger population of our campus community in addition to Jewish students\\". On November 3, student Jonathan Butler launched a hunger strike, vowing not to eat until the president resigned. One of Butler's stated reasons for this was that Timothy Wolfe's car had hit him during a protest against Wolfe at the school's homecoming parade. Students confronted the president by linking arms in front of his vehicle. The car revved its engine and following this Butler was bumped. No police charges were filed in connection to the incident.Did #Mizzou Protestor Jonathan Butler Lie About Being Hit By UM President's Car?, YouTube His statement said, \\"Mr. Wolfe had ample opportunity to create policies and reform that could shift the culture of Mizzou in a positive direction but in each scenario he failed to do so.\\" Butler later cited his participation in the Ferguson protests against the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown as a major influence for his action. On November 7, with hundreds of prospective students flooding Mizzou's campus for the university's recruiting day, student protesters intervened with a \\"mock tour\\" where they recited racist incidents that occurred at MU beginning in 2010 with the dispersion of cotton balls on the lawn of the Gaines/Oldham Black Culture Center along with more recent events such as the use of racial epithets against two young women of color outside of the MU Student Recreation Complex. On November 8, university football players announced they would not practice or play until Wolfe resigned, potentially costing the university a $1 million fine if they had to forfeit an upcoming game against Brigham Young University. The Southeastern Conference Football Commissioner issued a statement saying, \\"I respect Missouri's student-athletes for engaging on issues of importance and am hopeful the concerns at the center of this matter will be resolved in a positive manner.\\" The Mizzou Athletics Department previously indicated that it fully supported the players' actions. The protests attracted widespread local, regional, and national news media attention. Some protesters said the coverage was impacted by journalists' lack of previous race-related experience, reliance on scripted behaviors, and desire to cover the event as \\"outsiders looking in.\\"  Loss of health insurance for grad students  One of Butler's reasons for his hunger strike was \\"graduate students being robbed of their health insurance\\".Jonathan Butler: Meet the man whose hunger strike flipped the script at Mizzou, CNN, November 10, 2015 In August 2015, the university had issued a statement to graduate students that said, \\"The Affordable Care Act prevents employers from giving employees money specifically so they can buy health insurance on the individual market. Graduate teaching and research assistants are classified as employees by the IRS, so they fall under this ruling.\\"Information About Student Health Insurance , gradstudies.missouri.edu, August 15, 2015University of Missouri ends funding for graduate student health insurance, blames feds , Mizzou News, Daily Clips Packet, August 18, 2015U. of Missouri cuts health insurance subsidies for grad students, USA Today, August 21, 2015 The university had known about the Affordable Care Act concerns since July 21, but put off communicating with graduate students until announcing on August 14 that subsidies would be cut, the day before graduate health insurance plans were set to expire.  Resignations  Wolfe issued a statement on November 8 implying that he would not step down and that he was \\"dedicated to ongoing dialogue to address these very complex, societal issues as they affect our campus community\\". On November 9, however, Wolfe announced his resignation. Later that day Chancellor Loftin announced he would resign at the end of 2015 to take a research role at the University. His departure was hastened by the Board of Curators on November 11, who passed his responsibility to Interim Chancellor Hank Foley. His departure was initially assumed to be related to the protests. However, unlike Wolfe, student protesters had not requested that he step down. His resignation was the congruence of several issues raised by administrators and faculty, who were displeased with his leadership style, dismissal of administrators, and management of several campus incidents of racism and graduate health insurance subsidies that were allowed to lapse under his leadership. The days after the resignation announcement resulted in some confusion, cancelled classes and reports of threats and suspicious activity. On the evening of November 10, there were reports of vehicles and unidentified individuals around campus posing a threat.  Rolla arrest  A computer science and math student at Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla confessed during his arrest to making a hoax threat to the university. An account with the same username on Reddit bragged that he had \\"trolled\\" Mizzou.  Reactions =Melissa Click incident A frame from Schierbecker's video made famous by social media: Melissa Click tells Schierbecker \\"you need to get out.\\" and later yells \\"I need some muscle over here.\\" Soon after the announcement of the resignations, there was a widely publicized dispute between student photojournalist Tim Tai, on a freelance assignment for ESPN, and protesters on Carnahan Quad where they had erected an encampment. While attempting to cover the event, Tai got into a dispute with, and was physically confronted by, students and those who would later be identified as University of Missouri staff and faculty, including untenured communication professor Melissa Click. Click first appeared to attempt to grab Tai's camera, and then to threaten Tai, yelling \\"Who wants to help me get this reporter out of here? I need some muscle over here.\\" Other staff who interfered with Tai's attempts to photograph the scene included Janna Basler, the university's assistant director of Greek life and leadership, and Richard J. \\"Chip\\" Callahan, professor and chair of religious studies. Video of the incident where Tai debated First Amendment rights to be in the public area was recorded by student Mark Schierbecker and became widely distributed and commented on in the mainstream media. The day after the incident, with Tai getting support from the Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder and others, Concerned Student 1950 passed out fliers calling the confrontation between journalists and protesters a \\"Teachable Moment\\" and directing the students to welcome the media to campus as a way to tell the story of the protests. The student group also removed signs previously put up warning the media to stay away from the student encampments. Three University of Missouri employees involved in the altercation subsequently apologized, one of them, Melissa Click, resigning from her courtesy appointment at the Missouri School of Journalism. On January 25, 2016, Click was charged with misdemeanor assault linked to her behavior during the incident and accepted community service in exchange for dismissal of the charges.Assault charge filed against Missouri assistant professor, San Francisco Chronicle, Associated Press, January 25, 2016 , more than 100 faculty members had signed a letter in defense of Click. Several faculty members wrote letters of support to local and national news outlets. In a new video obtained by the Columbia Missourian in February 2016, Click was shown shouting a profanity at police officers as they attempted to clear protesting students from a road at the homecoming parade. Click defended her actions, saying that she was sorry for her language, but that she was also sorry she had to put herself between the police and the students in order to protect the students. Also in February, MU Faculty Council and the UM Intercampus Faculty Council urged MU administrators and the UM Board of Curators to observe the due process enshrined in the system's Collected Rules and Regulations when dealing with Click's case. On February 25, 2016, the University of Missouri Board of Curators voted 4‚Äì2 to terminate Click's employment with the university. As a result of this action, the University of Missouri was placed on the American Association of University Professors' Censure List. Commenting in an interview with the Chronicle of Higher Education, Click suggested a minority professor would not have been treated as harshly, stating, \\"I'm a white lady. I'm an easy target.\\" In 2017, she was hired as a lecturer by Gonzaga University, where she later became an assistant professor. KKK hoax On November 10, 2015, Student Body President Payton Head made an alarming Facebook post that he later rescinded. He stated, \\"Students please take precaution. Stay away from the windows in residence halls. The KKK has been confirmed to be sighted on campus. I'm working with the [campus police], the state trooper and the National Guard.\\" Major Brian Weimer with the school's police department responded by saying, \\"There is no Ku Klux Klan on campus.\\" Weimer also said that the National Guard was not on campus. Head apologized, saying on Facebook, \\"I'm sorry about the misinformation that I have shared through social media.\\"University of Missouri students report threats; police quell KKK rumors. CNN. November 11, 2015 On November 11, 2015, the MU officially remained open, though many individual classes were cancelled after threats on social media and by phone. During a meeting between the Missouri Legislative Black Caucus and student activists, University of Missouri police reported that an anonymous caller phoned in a threat to the Oldham Black Culture Center. One professor, Dale Brigham, was at the center of controversy when he chose to administer a planned exam for Nutritional Science 1034, saying, \\"If you don't feel safe coming to class, then don't come to class... I will be there, and there will be an exam administered in our class,\\" while allowing students an option to take a make- up exam. After some students complained that the professor was not taking the threats seriously, Brigham apologized and offered his resignation, saying, \\"If my leaders think that my leaving would help, I am all for it. I made a mistake, and I do not want to cause further harm.\\" However, the university turned down the resignation later that day. Gus T. Ridgel, one of the nine African-American students enrolled into the University of Missouri in 1950, \\"was surprised and disappointed by the racist incidents at the university that prompted a campus upheaval\\". U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Jarred Prier argues that Russian influence operatives use U.S. social media as an information warfare medium, spreading false information during incidents of racial unrest in order to inflame racial tensions in the United States and discredit the Obama administration. An image of an African American child injured from police one year earlier was circulated by Twitter bots, declaring that the child was beaten by the KKK at the University of Missouri. One month after the protests subsided, the Twitter account changed their profile image from an African American man to a German man, tweeting instead in German about refugee crime in Germany.  Related protests  The University of Missouri events inspired other protests or indications of solidarity at over eighty other campuses in the United States. Among these were Ithaca College, Yale University, Smith College, Claremont McKenna College, Amherst College, Emporia State University, Brandeis University, and Tufts University. On November 13, the dean of students at Claremont McKenna College stepped down, after student protesters adopted similar tactics to those in Missouri, including a hunger strike.  Appointment of interim president  On the evening of November 12, the governing board of the University of Missouri decided in a closed-door meeting to name Michael Middleton, a law professor and deputy chancellor emeritus as the interim president. Middleton, a 1968 graduate of the university and the third African American to graduate from its law school, recently retired from the university after 30 years.  Politicians  During an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, President Barack Obama praised the protesters, but cautioned against protest tactics that he felt stifled open dialogue at the University of Missouri and other campuses. He said, \\"There is clearly a problem at the University of Missouri, and that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest‚Äîwhat they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. I want an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry.\\" Missouri Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder issued a statement supporting the journalists covering the protests on November 9. He called for investigating the incident saying, \\"Faculty and staff cannot be allowed to pick and choose which rights, viewpoints and freedoms they respect. I renew my call to restore law and order on campus, so the rights of all are protected.\\"  Turning away reporters at campus meeting  On February 10, 2016, Concerned Student 1950 held a meeting on campus. The meeting had been advertised as a \\"town hall\\" for \\"black students and students of color.\\" The group asked all reporters to leave before the meeting began. Several white reporters then left the room. However, one reporter, Mark Schierbecker, the same videographer from the November Melissa Click incident, refused, and justified his refusal to leave by saying the unreserved room was a \\"limited public forum\\" that was open to students and that he was a reporter on assignment and it was his \\"personal preference\\" to stay. Despite the meeting taking place on campus property, the group continued to ask him to leave, and eventually threatened to call campus police. Instead, the group disbanded soon after the start of the meeting, intending to relocate the meeting at a more private area of campus. Student enrollment and alumni reaction In April 2016 Jillian Melchior wrote in the online publication Heat Street, based on internal emails reviewed by its staff and National Review, that the university had suffered significant damage to its reputation and image over its handling of the protests. This reaction was reflected in a barrage of highly critical correspondence from alumni, donors and the families of current and prospective students attacking what was perceived as the administration's unwarranted deference to campus extremists. According to the report there has been a sharp decline in donations, particularly to the Athletic Department, where donations were down by 72%. Enrollment in the freshmen class also dropped by around 25% and Melchior asserted that some current students were considering transferring to other schools. Altogether, some 2,273 fewer students enrolled at the Columbia campus for the fall 2016 semester, and the protests have been blamed at least in part for this decline. Continued declines in enrollment and funding has caused continuing budget cuts and jobs being eliminated. Pelema Morrice, vice provost for enrollment, told the Columbia Daily Tribune on May 15, 2017 that the university has studied the causes of declining enrollment. \\"It is clear from what we learned thus far that the vast majority of our undergraduate enrollment concerns are closely tied to our public perception issues throughout the state and throughout the country.\\" According to The New York Times, freshman enrollment for the fall 2017 semester was down by 35% compared with two years prior. Seven dormitories have been temporarily closed and some 400 positions have been cut. \\"Students of all races have shunned Missouri, but the drop in freshman enrollment last fall was strikingly higher among blacks, at 42 percent, than among whites, at 21 percent.\\"Anemna Hartocollis, \\"Long After Protests, Students Shun the University of Missouri\\", New York Times, July 9, 2017.  Formal report  Adrianna Kezar and Sharon Fries-Britt, at the invitation of the university, used the events as a case study and published a report in 2018. It introduces a \\"Collective Trauma Recovery Framework (CTRF) for dealing with such complex and usually emotionally charged incidents\\".

He is the current world record holder for the event, having scored 148 out of 150 at the 2014 ISSF World Cup meet in Munich, Germany. Apart from his world-record feat, Kneale has won two medals in a major international competition, a silver at the 2015 World Shotgun Championships and a bronze as a representative of the Isle of Man team at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. Career Born and raised in the Isle of Man, Kneale spent most of his childhood as a sporting enthusiast, representing the nation in cricket and also captaining the men's under- nineteen rugby team. After suffering a fractured leg which left him unable to play rugby at age eighteen, Kneale took up shooting more seriously, and eventually tried his hand at double trap. Although he began the sport, as a 16-year-old teen, in an international meet, Kneale set his shooting history as a member of the British national team in 2002. At that time, he helped his fellow shooters secure a bronze medal in a team event at the ISSF World Championships in Lahti, Finland. Kneale's marksmanship prominence, however, did not occur until 2010, when he claimed his first individual double trap medal at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India, prevailing over 17-year-old junior world champion Asher Noria in a shoot-off 6‚Äì5 for the bronze. At the 2014 ISSF World Cup meet held in Munich, Germany, Kneale attained a massive score of 148 out of 150 targets to establish a new world record for the men's double trap, but fell short to Jeffrey Holguin of the United States in a bronze-medal shoot-off 28‚Äì26. Following his tremendous world-record feat, Kneale had been given the honor to lead the Isle of Man delegation at the opening ceremony of the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland. There, he finished twelfth in the double trap with 120 clay pigeons, and failed to advance to the final, missing a chance to improve on his third-place effort four years earlier. The 2015 season witnessed a medal redemption for Kneale, as he earned a silver in the men's double trap at the World Shotgun Championships in Lonato, Italy, losing the title to Russia's Vasily Mosin in the gold medal match 26 clays to 29. With his runner-up finish, Kneale has been selected to represent Great Britain at his Olympic debut in Rio 2016. Tim Kneale has won the Isle of Man's first medal at 2018 Commonwealth Games in Australia in the double trap shooting event. He finished with a score of 70 in the final - four targets behind Scotland's David McMath with India's Ankur Mittal third.

(Ray) Bloch (August 3, 1902 ‚Äì March 29, 1982) was a European- American composer, songwriter, conductor, pianist, author and arranger. He is best remembered as the arranger and orchestra conductor for The Ed Sullivan Show during its entire run from 1948 to 1971. Biography Ray Bloch was born in Alsace-Lorraine and immigrated to the United States with his parents as an infant. His father was a chef. Career During the 1920s, he performed with small groups on piano and also conducted ballroom bands. Later in the decade he began appearing as a pianist on radio stations. He began working as an arranger and composer for the Four Eton Boys in the early 1930s, and followed that as a conductor for choral groups. In 1939 he joined the CBS radio variety show Johnny Presents as choral director and was promoted to orchestra conductor. This was the beginning of a long and successful career in \\"conducting, coaching, orchestrating, and choral directing\\" on radio, television, and albums. Radio Bloch and his orchestra were featured on numerous radio variety shows of the late-1930s and 1940s. These included: Johnny Presents (1939-1946), The Gay Nineties Revue (CBS, 1939-1944), Let Yourself Go (CBS, 1944-1945), The Continental Celebrity Club (1945-1946), The Milton Berle Show (NBC, 1948-1949), and The Mary Small Revue (1945).

In 1951 Bloch hosted his own show, The Bloch Party, a 60-minute variety show on CBS Radio featuring Judy Lynn, the Russ Emery Chorus, and the Ray Bloch Orchestra. The orchestra was a fixture on several game shows, including Take It or Leave It (CBS, 1940-1947). Quick as a Flash (1944‚Äì1949) ‚Äì during which \\"clues were elaborately dramatized or were musically illustrated by Ray Bloch's orchestra\\"‚Äì and Sing It Again (1948‚Äì1951). Bloch also worked on Philip Morris Playhouse (CBS, 1939‚Äì1943), and in several Orson Welles drama presentations. In 1945 Bloch signed an exclusive contract with Signature Records to serve as \\"musical conductor for all disks by individual singers\\". The Ray Bloch Orchestra backed many singers, including The Five DeMarco Sisters, Kay Armen, and Monica Lewis. The orchestra itself was featured on Signature Records' The Merry Christmas Album (1947), Best Loved Christmas Music Album (1947), and a 78 record with the songs \\"I Must Have Your Love\\" and \\"Together\\" (1953). Bloch wrote songs such as \\"When Love Has Gone\\", \\"You're Everything That's Lovely\\", \\"In the Same Old Way\\", \\"In My Little Red Book\\", \\"The Wide Open Spaces\\", \\"Sam the Vegetable Man\\", \\"Let's Make Up a Little Party\\", and \\"If You Were Mine\\". He often worked with W. Edward Breuder and Paul Rusincky. Television Bloch was the arranger and orchestra conductor for The Ed Sullivan Show from the show's debut on June 20, 1948 until its final show in June 1971. He also led the orchestra for The Jackie Gleason Show. Each week during his show, Jackie Gleason would introduce Bloch as \\"the flower of the music world\\". Other activities He was on the original board of governors of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences and also on the board of the New York Friars' Club.

(2015). Conus Linnaeus, 1758. In: MolluscaBase (2015). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=137813 on 2015-11-12 Prior to 2009, cone snail species had all traditionally been grouped into the single genus Conus. However, Conus is now more precisely defined, and there are several other accepted genera of cone snails. For a list of the currently accepted genera, see Conidae. For a list of the currently accepted species within the genus Conus, based on the information in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) list, see: list of Conus species. Species in the genus Conus sensu stricto can be found in the tropical and subtropical seas of the world, at depths ranging from the sublittoral to 1,000 m. They are very variable in some of their characters, such as the tuberculation of the spire and body whorl, striae, colors and the pattern of coloring. Many fossil species have been described; they are extensively distributed, and first appear in Cretaceous strata. Description The thick shell of species in the genus Conus sensu stricto, is obconic, with the whorls enrolled upon themselves. The spire is short, smooth or tuberculated. The narrow aperture is elongated with parallel margins and is truncated at the base. The operculum is very small relative to the size of the shell. It is corneous, narrowly elongated, with an apical nucleus, and the impression of the muscular attachment varies from one-half to two-thirds of the inner surface. The outer lip shows a slight sutural sinus.G.W. Tryon (1884) Manual of Conchology, structural and systematic, with illustrations of the species, vol. VI; Philadelphia, Academy of Natural Sciences List of synonyms and alternate representations As this list shows, many genera that were formerly recognized within the family Conidae, have become

Plot Over drinks at Toronto's Wheat Sheaf Tavern, Hermes and Apollo get into a debate about whether animals could live happily if they had the same cognitive and speech abilities as humans.\\"Alexis's Fifteen Dogs wins Scotiabank Giller Prize\\". The Globe and Mail, November 11, 2015. They decide to wager a year of servitude on the outcome of granting the gifts of human reasoning and language to a group of dogs in a nearby clinic. Given their newfound abilities, the dogs are able to escape the clinic and make their way to the city's High Park, where they set up their own new protosociety. The novel then explores the functioning of their new society through the impact of human values, such as individuality and personal freedom, on the conventionally hierarchical social order of dog packs. Key characters in the canine society include Atticus, a Neapolitan Mastiff who naturally emerges as the group leader; Majnoun, a black poodle who is reluctant to trust other dogs; Frick and Frack, a pair of Labrador retrievers who are leery about their new reality; and Prince, a mutt who embraces his language skills to become a poet. Themes=Language The dogs develop their own language, which creates conflict in the pack. Prince becomes a poet and his passion for language is a source of pleasure for him. Some dogs appreciate his use of poetry and wit, but other dogs find it strange and hate it. Majnoun learns to understand and speak English, which forges a bond between him and a human (Nira) as they have long conversations and learn about one another. Death The immortal gods Apollo and Hermes are fascinated with mortals on Earth because of their relationship with death. Throughout the book, the reader learns how each dog dies and whether or not the dog died happy. The death plots include murder and euthanasia. The death of humans is also part of the narrative along with how the dogs respond. Poetry The novel includes several poems composed by Prince. At the end, the author includes a \\"note on the text\\" where he describes the poetry genre used throughout the novel. Love and friendship Several dogs form friendships (Bella and Athena; Dougie and Benjy) that they experience differently because of their gift of intelligence. Majnoun asks Hermes about love and Prince loves language.

She is best known as the founder of the Ounakorn Center and Satree Sarn Magazine, Thailand's first women's magazine which aimed to inspire women to have active participation in community affairs. In 1961, she is also the first Thai recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service. The award was given for her role in giving \\"Thai women a new and creative role in nation-building.\\" The award included $10,000, a gold medal and a certificate given to her and the other recipients. Early life and education Khun Nilawan was born on 6 December 1915 in Bangkok. She owes her Buddhist education to her father who became a monk after Nilawan's mother died. Having been educated in the spirit of charity and service since young, Nilawan pursued her dream of being a teacher and earned her certificate from the Bethaburi School of Teacher Training in Bangkok. In 1936, she obtained her Bachelor of Arts degree in Modern Languages (English and French) with First Honors in English from Chulalongkorn University. Career and legacy Khun Nilawan taught for a year at a secondary school under the Ministry of Education, after which she became chief of the Official Publications Section, and later chief of the Foreign Press Section, both under the Department of Foreign Affairs. It was during this time when, exposed to Western notions of human freedom, she realized the importance of education for the limitless self-fulfillment of an individual, in contrast to the traditional role women played in society; confined within the domestic sphere with no involvement in civic and community affairs. Despite the lack of funds, Nilawan founded the fortnightly magazine Satree Sarn Magazine in 1947 with the help of three friends. The magazine was targeted at women and its contents ranged from fashion and crafts to art and literature. In just a span of three years, it became Thailand's most widely read magazine until its last publication in 1996 due to financial problems. Her publishing venture flourished with the founding of Daroon Sarn (Youth's Magazine), a weekly for adolescents and young adults, and Sapdha Sarn, a weekly newsmagazine containing in-depth significant news. Alongside Daroon Sarn, Khun Nilawan launched the Preeya Club for children which organized arts and crafts classes and other children's activities. Aside from these, she also ventured into other projects like a translation services and a weekly radio program, while collaborating with the Thai Library Association to raise the standards of library work in Thailand. She was also the Society of Printing president for a time. Among her various positions were president and secretary of the PEN Center of Thailand; executive secretary of the Thai Foundation for Journalism Education; member of the National Council on Education, chairperson of the Executive Committee on the National Council of Women of Thailand; member of the Thai Merchants Association; vice president of the Pan Pacific and Southeast Asia Women's Association. To provide a home for various homeless NGOs, she founded and directed the Ounakorn Center which also served as a home to foreign visitors in related fields. Pintong died on 7 February 2017, aged 101.

The battalion has been assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, 11th Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division. The battalion has participated in World War I, World War II, Operation Just Cause, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation Enduring Freedom. The battalion inactivated in 2014 as part of ongoing force reductions History=World War I The 4-320th FAR's beginnings can be traced back to America's entry into the World War I. As part of the nation's mobilization, 4-320th was constituted, organized and activated in August 1917 as Battery D, 320th Field Artillery (D/320th FA). As part of the original 82nd Division, D/320th FA played a key role at Lorraine, St. Mihiel, and the Meuse Argonne region in France. Following the Armistice, the 320th FA demobilized, only to be reconstituted in June 1921 as part of the United States Organized Reserves. World War II In August 1942, when the 82nd Infantry Division was converted to an airborne division, the 320th FA was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Glider Field Artillery Battalion (GFAB). Because the GFAB had only three firing batteries, the lineage of D/320th was consolidated with A/320th. As part of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 320th GFAB fought in a number of hot spots. First, the 320th GFAB was part of the campaign in Sicily, acting in reserve. The unit first saw action at the Volturno River on the Italian mainland. The crucial Normandy invasion was the next stop for the 320th GFAB. Under difficult conditions, the unit helped make the invasion a success. As a result of the 320th's actions during Operation Overlord, the unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. The 320th GFAB next fought in Operation Market Garden and then the Battle of the Bulge when the Germans attempted their last-ditch offensive. The 320th GFAB then fought and played a role in the final push through the Rhineland to defeat Germany. Upon the war's end the unit completed its duties in Europe as part of the post-war occupation in Berlin. Early Cold War After the war, the 320th GFAB went through a number of transitions. It was inactivated on 15 December 1948 and relieved from assignment to the 82nd Airborne Division on 14 December 1950. On 1 August 1951 it was reorganized and redesignated as the 320th Airborne Field Artillery Battalion (AFAB), and activated at Fort Benning, Georgia. During the 1950s, the 320th FA served as the field artillery battalion of the separate 508th Airborne Regimental Combat Team. When the Army eliminated infantry regiments and battalions from division and organized under the Pentomic structure, the 320th Field Artillery was reorganized as a parent regiment under the Combat Arms Regimental System. D/320th was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division until 1964, but inactivated when the Army restructured to the Reorganization Objective Army Division in 1964. Late Cold War As part of the transition to the U.S. Army Regimental System in 1986, D/320th was activated in the 193rd Infantry Brigade in the Panama Canal Zone. The battery participated in Operation Just Cause before being inactivated again in 1994. Global War on Terror As part the Army's reorganization to modular brigade combat teams, D/320th was redesignated as Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 4th Battalion, 320th Field Artillery. The battalion activated on 16 September 2004 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky and assigned to the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division. With the 4th BCT, 4-320th FAR deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2005‚Äì2006, and to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from 2008‚Äì2009, 2010‚Äì2011, and in 2013.

Plot In a glass-roofed workshop, an inventor is surrounded by mechanical devices for a complicated machine. The inventor's servants show in a respectably dressed lady and gentleman; the inventor welcomes them in and begins to demonstrate his invention to them. Setting the machine in motion, he unrolls a large screen and places a small image of the Three Graces on a chair; thanks to the machine, the Graces are projected at life-size on the screen, and they briefly come to life before disappearing. Next, the inventor and his staff give a further demonstration, with a model in Grecian garb being projected. As before, the projected image takes on its own life, waving to the gentleman visitor. The visitors indicate that they are ready to be photographed by the wireless process, and the lady takes a seat in front of the photographic apparatus. Her head appears in close up, projected on the screen; the projected head makes grotesque faces, including a mostly toothless grin and a fierce scowl. The lady faints from shock and has to be revived with smelling salts. The inventor, proffering apologies, ushers the gentleman client to the seat, but he fares even worse: his projected portrait shows him as a hairy, monkey-like creature, gibbering maniacally. In a rage, the gentleman runs around the room, trying to destroy the machine, but touching one of the devices gives him an electrical shock that makes his hair stand on end. He rushes to his lady companion, whose outer garments are torn apart when she stands too near another device, leaving her in her chemise and petticoats. The two clients leave the studio in a rage, while the inventor and his servants laugh uproariously. Production M√©li√®s appears in the film as the inventor, with Fernande Albany as the lady client. The film's painted set evokes the contemporary design for photography studios, built partly of glass and iron; the actual studio in which M√©li√®s made his films was built on such a design. Several other M√©li√®s sets have similarly self-referential elements, including the photography studio in A Mix-up in the Gallery and the workshops and factories in A Trip to the Moon, The Impossible Voyage, and The Conquest of the Pole. The film's special effects were created using substitution splices, superimpositions, and dissolves. Themes The Three Graces appear on the inventor's screen With its photographic apparatus creating fresh and unexpected views of its subjects, Long Distance Wireless Photography can be seen as an allegory for the seemingly magical properties of cinema. The film scholar Mark Bould described the film as a satirical look at film's capabilities for artificiality and realism: The film can also be seen as anticipatory science fiction; the film scholar Linda Williams cited the film as \\"an uncanny anticipation of the not yet invented marvel of television.\\" The film writer Dennis Fischer likewise described the film as showing \\"a large screen television some twenty years before the device's actual invention.\\" The film critic William B. Parrill likened the machine to a science-fiction device in the 1958 film The Fly: \\"Unfortunately, it seems to be some sort of matter transmitter, like those in The Fly, which occasionally mixes in the odd bit of extraneous matter.\\" The philosopher Eugene Thacker cited Long Distance Wireless Photography as an example of his concept of dark media, \\"the mediation of that which is unavailable or inaccessible to the senses\\". Thacker notes that the machine in the film, by generating comically altered versions of the things it is intended to photograph, \\"serves a kind of pedagogical function as to the inner workings of cinema itself.\\" Other M√©li√®s films with themes relating to dark media include The Mysterious Retort and The Black Imp. Williams described sexist and voyeuristic overtones in the scene in which an image of the Three Graces is projected, \\"reproducing an image of women's bodies to the voyeuristic measure of male desire.\\" The film scholar Elizabeth Ezra went further, commenting that the machine does not in fact attempt to show actual women at all, but rather only an image from a male imagination: \\"These constructed women are also machines in themselves, which do exactly what they are programmed to do, and whose behavior differs noticeably from that of real women.\\" A publication about M√©li√®s's films from the Centre national du cin√©ma suggested that the film is about revealing the psychology of a person, capturing their real selves, through an imaginary photographic means; thus the lady client is shown as much less friendly and appealing than she appears to be real life, while her gentleman companion, evidently an elderly rake, is depicted as a monkey or satyr-like creature. The film scholar Fran√ßois Jost agreed, describing the projection as an image \\"probably in reflection of [the subject's] soul\\" (\\"sans doute √† l'image de son √¢me\\"). Release and reception The film was released by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1091‚Äì1095 in its catalogues. It was registered for American copyright at the Library of Congress on 24 March 1908. Parrill describes the film as \\"only moderately humorous,\\" speculating that it \\"was probably too complex for the average audience to understand.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Films directed by Georges M√©li√®s French science fiction comedy films French silent short films French films 1900s science fiction comedy films French black-and-white films 1908 short films 1908 films ","title":"Long Distance Wireless Photography"},{"id":"48525863","text":"Jian (Jane) Xu is a software engineer from China.

Jean De la Hoese was a pupil of Auguste De Keyser (1859) and from 1859 until 1870 of the Brussels Academy of Fine Arts. His early works were very academic, but later on he evolved to a freer style. This painter of aristocratic female beauty was a master portrait painter who depicted several masterpieces, including the portrait of his father which is exhibited in the Brussels Royal Museum of Fine Arts. De la Hoese painted landscapes and genre scenes with elegant ladies in interiors (at the beginning of his career with an emphasis on the representation of fabrics, in the line of Florent Willems). Most of his portraits are presentations of important members of Belgium's higher social classes and highly educated. They express an exceptional unconventional liveliness. The Belgian government commissioned him to paint the posthumously portrait of the Belgian Queen Louise-Marie for the Palais de la Nation, the seat of the Belgian Federal Parliament.

Born in Saint Helena, Bailey's father was a soldier, and the family returned to England in 1857, settling at Bargate (near West Row), Suffolk. Bailey worked on a farm from the age of nine, then when he was fourteen moved to work at Fence Colliery near Sheffield. He later transferred to Beighton Colliery, then Norwood Colliery, just over the border in Derbyshire. He was elected as the pit's checkweighman, and also became active in the South Yorkshire Miners' Association (SYMA).Joyce Bellamy and John Saville, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol. II, pp. 30-31 Bailey was a founder of the Derbyshire Miners' Association, a split from the SYMA, and represented it on the Trades Union Congress in 1883, 1887 and 1889. In 1884, he supported a strike at Norwood Colliery, and was fired, forcing him to take work as an insurance agent. This enabled him to become more politically active, being a founder of the Labour Electoral Association (LEA) in 1886, and leading a campaign for miners to be able to elect any other miners as their checkweighman, even if they were based at another colliery. This campaign was successful, with a law enabling it being passed in 1887. That year, Bailey was invited to become the full-time agent and general secretary of the Nottinghamshire Miners' Association. He took the post, and proved highly successful; in six years, he took membership from around 500 to nearly 19,000. Bailey remained involved with the LEA, and became a vice-president in 1890, and then president in 1892.

Rosa fedtschenkoana, which is found in Asia, was named in her honour (with a German transliteration of her name). Early life Ol'ga (Olga) Armfeld was born in Moscow in 1845. Her father was Alexandre Armfeldt who was a Professor at the University of Moscow. She was educated at home until she was eleven when she went to school where she showed an interest in Botany. She began collecting plants and from about 1861 she was using her art and language skills to translate academic descriptions from English, French and German naturalists. She was preparing illustrations, communicating with foreign naturalists and visiting the University's Zoological Museum. She worked for several years before she met the geologist, Alexei Pavlovich Fedchenko. Marriage and Turkestan She married the recently qualified Moscow University geology graduate Fedchenko, on 2 July 1867. She and her husband worked together and when in 1868 he was recommended to undertake a hazardous mission to the recently conquered region of Russian Turkestan. Olga became a full, but unpaid, member of the team. The mission was hazardous because Turkestan was still transitioning to becoming part of the Russian Empire. Her husband's name had been recommended to the first Governor- General of Turkestan, Konstantin von Kaufman. Kaufman was a military governor and he was still extending the borders of the Russian Empire. Kaufman wanted an investigation of what he saw as a \\"newly and scarcely explored region\\". Kaufman's team included the Fedchenkos, the war artist Vasily Vereshchagin and later the educationalist and linguist Nikolai Ostroumov. Kaufman set up a Tashkent outpost of the Moscow Society of Natural Scientists (OLEAE). The Fedchenkos did not set out immediately for Turkestan but they went on preparatory visits to Italy, France and Sweden to study their collections. Olga also went on solo trips to Russian Museums. During all this travelling she used the opportunity to make notes and gather exhibits. Together they went on botanical expeditions to the Caucasus, Crimea, Kyrgyzstan, southern Urals, West Tien Shan and the Pamir ranges. The Fenchenkos made three separate explorations between 1868 and 1872. These investigations were central to the Governor-General's policy as he wanted to see this information shared. The local newspaper was used to publish the scientific findings and Kaufman was targeting the 1872 Moscow All-Russian Technical Exhibition as an opportunity to display Turkestan research and artefacts. In 1872 she gave birth to Boris Fedtschenko. Alexei died in 1873 in a climbing accident on Mont Blanc, where he had gone to compare the glaciers with those he had seen in Turkestan; Olga buried her husband at Chamonix and returned to Moscow. Widow and naturalist The OLEAE, who had sent the two of them, now asked Olga to continue the task of publishing their findings. This was a large task as Olga had gathered over 1,500 specimens.. She catalogued their collections and then set out on further investigations alone. ' is one of the species she first described In 1878, Eduard August von Regel named and published Rosa fedtschenkoana after her.Trudy Imp. S.-Peterburgsk. Bot. Sada Vol.5 Issue2 on page314 Her son Boris also took an interest in botany. In the Memoirs of the Kazan Society of Naturalists Vol.32 and 33, Olga and Boris described 43 endemic species in the buttercup family Ranunculaceae found in Russian Turkestan. In 1901 Olga and Boris visited the Pamir ranges together. On their return they jointly published Flora of the Pamirs in 1901. Later in 1913 they again published Conspectus Florae Turkestanicae together. Olga contributed to Gardeners' Chronicle on 10 June 1905, giving a short description of Eremurus turkestanicus. She also published several works in 'Trudy Imp. S.-Peterburgsk. Bot. Sada' (Proceedings of the Petersburg Botanical Garden); including for Draba korshinskyi in 1914. Olga described 3 Juno irises, Iris baldshuanica (in Russk. Bot.

In 1906, Olga Fedtschenko became the second female corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Olga named one species of plant, Fritillaria seravschanica but she never published it (to validate the name). Later, another Russian botanist Alexei Vvedensky, a monocot specialist, appears to have changed Olga‚Äôs temporary epithet to Fritillaria olgae and formally described it in her son Boris Fedtschenko's book 'Flora Turkmenistan'. She died on April 24, 1921, in Petrograd (now called Saint Petersburg).

History F. T. Whitington was born in Adelaide, a younger son of eminent merchant, William Smallpeice Whitington, a member of South Australia's influential Whitington family. He was educated at Adelaide Educational Institution, and felt he was destined for the priesthood, but was opposed by his father, who had commercial ambitions for him, and for a time had him working in his father's office, but allowed him to leave to study Law at Adelaide University. He left the lawyer's office to work at the South Australian Register, making use of his training as an articled clerk to report on the Adelaide Supreme Court. He was soon promoted to sub-editor, but his religious avocation never left him. On 24 August 1877, at the age of 24 he was ordained by the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Adelaide, Dr. Augustus Short, one of the first two men ordained in the Adelaide Cathedral. His first posting was to the then sparsely settled Port Pirie, followed by a parish in suburban Adelaide, then succeeded George Kennion as bursar of St. Barnabas' Theological College, serving for six years. His next posting was to Kapunda, where he was responsible for churches within an area which stretched along the River Murray to the newly founded town of Renmark. After visiting England with the Bishop of Brisbane, he accepted in 1891 a position with the missionary staff of the Anglican Diocese of Brisbane, then was appointed the first general secretary of the Australian Board of Missions, for whom he visited the Far North of Australia and New Guinea. During this time that he contracted malaria, and was forced to seek a cooler climate, and in 1893 found his way to Hobart, Tasmania, as assistant-incumbent and canon of St. David's Cathedral. When Archdeacon A. N. Mason (c. 1837‚Äì1895) died, Whitington was appointed to take his place, holding the additional office of Vicar-General and Administrator of the Diocese of Tasmania in absentia Episcopi, serving for 30 years. During the Great War he was obliged to take his turn as Anglican minister to the Claremont camp, until Rev. J. W. Bethune was appointed permanent camp chaplain, and later appointed OBE. On his retirement, the Bishop of Tasmania (the Right Rev. Dr. R. Snowdon Hay) said: \\"... His work among us is an example of what may be done when energy, force of character, and patient endurance are added to Christian faith. Tasmania may have a Just pride in one whose devotion, ability and far-reaching influence have made him a prominent figure well-known and honoured throughout the Australian Church.\\" Last years On his retirement he retained the office of Vicar General, with the honorary title of Archdeacon. He maintained an interest in the Church, but lived privately, and completed several books. He suffered ill health for many years, being looked after by his daughter Mary Whitington and nurse Rita Mary Webberley, n√©e McKinlay.Rita had a colorful life: married to a policeman 1911, left him for a sawmill operator, divorced 1921, married once more in 1941 Recognition *Naval and Military Club have made him a life member in recognition of his wartime service. *He was elected by the Bishops of the General Synod of Australia one of the 12 honorary fellows of the Australian College of Theology *He was elected to the Council of the University of Tasmania, on which he served for 18 years.

He was said to have graduated from the University of Oxford and to have been a professor of divinity, but this cannot be confirmed. He was appointed Bishop of Meath in 1563 when he was in England. He returned to Ireland, was consecrated bishop and made a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. He was always diligent in attendance at Council meetings. He was vigorous in beating off raids on his diocese by Shane O'Neill, the effective ruler of Ulster. He enjoyed the friendship of Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who praised his sound judgment, hospitality and blameless private life. His good qualities led Sidney and Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Armagh, to propose Brady as Archbishop of Dublin, after they had lobbied successfully for the recall of Archbishop Hugh Curwen (who became Bishop of Oxford). Shortly after however Brady and Loftus quarreled, and Loftus blocked Brady's nomination in order to obtain the See of Dublin for himself. He married Alice, daughter of Robert Weston, Lord Chancellor of Ireland and his first wife Alice Jenyngs. They had numerous children including Luke, their eldest son. After Brady's death, his widow remarried Sir Geoffrey Fenton and had further issue. The poet Nicholas Brady was the bishop's great-grandson.

It is part of the first fortified belt of the forts of Metz. Buried since the construction of the Eastern expressway in 1968, it is covered by a green space, although some remnants of the fort remain visible.  Historical context  The first fortified belt of Metz consists of forts de Saint-Privat (1870) of Queuleu (1867), des Bordes (1870) Saint-Julien (1867), Gambetta, D√©roul√®de, Decaen, Plappeville (1867) and St. Quentin (1867), most unfinished or still in the planning stages is in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War burst out. During the Annexation, Metz will oscillate between a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of period,. and will exceed 25,000 men before the First World War. gradually became the most important stronghold of the German Reich.Fran√ßois Roth, \\"Metz annex√©e √† l‚ÄôEmpire allemand\\", dans Fran√ßois-Yves Le Moigne, Histoire de Metz, Toulouse, Privat, 1986, p. 350.  Construction and facilities  The fort Zastrow is designed in the spirit of the \\"detached forts\\" concept developed by Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The interval between the Fort Queuleu ( Goeben ) and the Fort Saint-Julien ( Manteuffel ), being judged excessive, it was decided to strengthen the fortified line by building Fort Zastrow.. The Feste Zatrow was quickly built by German engineers between 1873 and 1875.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the relief of the garrison is guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. The Fort des Bordes serves as a depot and barracks from 1873-1918. Then it is reinvested by the French army in 1919, and serves as an internment camp for draft evaders and deserters. In 1940, the fort is reinvested again by the German army. It is not remilitarised after 1945. The Fort des Bordes is closed permanently in 1954.  Second World War  In early September 1944, at the beginning of the Battle of Metz. the German command integrated the defenses around Metz. On September 2, 1944, Metz was declared in effect by the Reich fortress Hitler. The fortress must be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer.. The next day, September 3, 1944, General Krause, then commander of the fortress of Metz, established his High Command, the main command post in the barracks fort Alvensleben. Fort Plappeville was indeed the center of the defenses of Metz, with the west fort Manstein (Girardin), run by the SS colonel Joachim von Siegroth, North Fort Zastrow (Les Bordes) held by SS Colonel Wagner and south Fort Prince August von W√ºrttemberg (Saint-Privat) held by the SS colonel Ernst Kemper.. The same day, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley-Bussi√®res, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. On November 9, 1944, no less than 1,299 heavy bombers, both B-17s and B-24s, dump hundreds of bombs on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of Third army.. Most bombers dropped their bombs without visibility from over 20,000 feet, so they often missed. In Metz, 689 loads of bombs hit the seven forts designated as priority targets. The bombing did nothing but cause collateral damage. At Thionville and Saarbr√ºcken, the result is inconclusive, proving once again the inadequacy of the massive bombing of military targets.. But one by one, the isolated forts, attacked by the advancing troops of the 95th Infantry Division to the north, and 5th Infantry Divisionto the south, succumb. The Fort des Bordes was taken by 5th Infantry Division, part of George S. Patton's army, on November 21, 1944. at the end of the Battle of Metz. The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to surrender. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar.. The objective of the German staff, which was to save time by stalling US troops for the longest possible period, before they could advance to the front of the Siegfried Line, has been largely achieved.

The game launched in Japan in December 2014, and worldwide in November 2015. Gameplay consisted of playing arcade crane-like games in hopes of acquiring badges, the game's main collectable. Badges were usually themed around other Nintendo properties, and once collected could be used to apply in the 3DS' HOME Menu. In addition to being decorative, some badges had special functions to them, such as launching applications and were compatible in other software as well. In June 2017, it was announced that updates to the service would be discontinued, although the service itself is still operational. Gameplay Nintendo Badge Arcade takes place in an arcade filled with machines known as badge catchers, each containing badges based on various Nintendo franchises such as Super Mario, Animal Crossing, The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, and Pok√©mon (as well as third-party franchises such as Yo- Kai Watch and Mega Man) which are reorganised regularly. The arcade is hosted by a pink, anthropomorphic rabbit character called Arcade Bunny, who always greets the player, and often introduces promotional events. The badge catchers are viewed from a 2-D side-on perspective. Similar to real-life claw machines, players must move the catcher's crane using a button, pick up badges, and try and drop them off into a prize pit. They can accomplish this by simply picking them up, or use other techniques such as pushing them or causing landslides (this only works if there is a big pile of badges). Some badge catchers use alternate means of obtaining badges. The hammer crane knocks badges to the right, the bomb crane blasts badges away in all directions, and the rod crane (which originally went unused, but was first revealed on April 28, 2016 in Japan) uses an extendable arm to move the badges. Any badges that the player obtains can be placed on the Nintendo 3DS' HOME Menu, with certain badges able to launch some of the 3DS' built-in applications. Most badges can also be used as decorations for the Swapdoodle messaging app. First-time players begin the game with five free plays, after which they must purchase additional plays via the Nintendo eShop. Special themes for the HOME Menu, and one set of badges based on Arcade Bunny, can also be unlocked by purchasing enough plays during certain periods. Once per day, players can use the Practice Catcher to practice catching dummy badges. Players earn a free bonus play for every ten dummy badges they collect, plus additional plays should they uncover a bonus badge. Additional plays may also be offered to the player through occasional events. In theory, it is possible to have up to seven free plays in a single day, albeit chances of this happening are very slim.

Post-launch, Gartner analysts noted that SAP S/4HANA represented a \\"transformational shift,\\" but raised questions about the functionality, availability, pricing and migration surrounding S/4HANA. By 21 April 2015, 370 customers had purchased S/4HANA. After the first half of 2015, positive growth was confirmed for SAP. In October 2015 SAP confirmed that S/4HANA had exceeded over 1,300 customers. Growth continued through the third quarter of 2015. Following its third quarter earnings announcement, SAP said the number of SAP S/4HANA customers had risen to 1,300. After fourth quarter close of 2016, SAP announced that 5,400 customers had implemented SAP S/4HANA. By 30 June 2018, the customer base for product reached 8,900 customers. There are numerous ERP systems with the same intention. Some of the product's competitors in the Software as a Service space are Oracle, Microsoft and Workday, Inc.  Editions and deployment  SAP S/4HANA can be deployed on premises, in the cloud, or through a hybrid model. The S/4HANA product offering consists of two editions: SAP S/4HANA On- Premise and SAP S/4HANA Cloud. SAP S/4HANA On-Premise is similar in terms of coverage, functionality, industry-specific support, and localization to the current SAP Business Suite (in 39 languages, 64 country versions).

This depends on a customer‚Äôs starting point. For example, new implementation, system conversion, and selective data transition. * New implementation - This is a new implementation of SAP S/4HANA (green field): customers who are migrating from a non-SAP legacy system or from an SAP ERP system and implementing a fresh system that requires an initial data load. In this scenario, the SAP S/4HANA system is implemented, and master and transactional data are migrated from the legacy system, thus standard data migration tools and content has to be used. * System conversion - This is a complete conversion of an existing SAP Business Suite system to SAP S/4HANA (brownfield): customers who want to change their current SAP ERP system to SAP S/4HANA. This scenario is technically based on Software Update Manager (SUM) with Database Migration Option (DMO) in case the customer is not yet on SAP HANA as the underlying database. * Selective Data Tranistion (formerly: Landscape Transformation) - This is a consolidation of current regional SAP systems into one global SAP S/4HANA system or a split out of different parts of a system: customers who want to consolidate their landscape or carve out selected entities (such as a company code) or processes into a single SAP S/4HANA system.  Product lifecycle  Both SAP S/4HANA on-premise and the SAP S/4HANA cloud editions have release strategies. The cloud editions are released quarterly. The on-premise edition has one new release per year, and receives additional functionality and corrections in the form of Feature Pack Stacks (FPS) or Service Pack Stacks (SPS) each quarter. On-premise: Each year, SAP is shipping a new product version of its on-premise SAP S/4HANA product (e.g. SAP S/4HANA 1610) this will always be followed by three successive FPS on a quarterly basis, after this SAP releases the next product version and the previous product version is receiving SPS on a quarterly basis until the end of mainstream maintenance. Technically, a FPS is like a SPS, but it may include non-disruptive, non-mandatory features. The numbering of FPS/SPS will be consecutive, i.e. the first SPS after a FPS3 would be consequently SPS4.

It was preceded by the 1934 election. Due to the Second World War no elections were held in 1940 and 1943 therefore the 1937 election was followed by the 1946 election. Overview of the result As in all previous inter-war elections, the Independent group won a majority of the seats and this majority was bolstered by holding the majority of the aldermanic seats also. By 1937 the Labour Party held almost all the seats in the industrial eastern part of the county. Boundary changes There were a number of boundary changes at this election. In Carmarthen town the boundaries were redrawn, reducing the number of wards from four to three. In Llanelli, in contrast, the number of wards were increased from eight to nine following a similar process. An additional ward was also created in Ammanford and new wards at Pontyberem and Trimsaran. Other wards were renamed or had their boundaries slightly altered. Unopposed returns Around half the wards were uncontested, mainly in the rural areas. Contested elections A similar number of contests took place compared with 1934.

It is used in conjunction with other examination techniques such as Cogan‚Äôs lid twitch test or enhancement of blepharoptosis from prolonged upward gaze. It is a simple, quick, and non-invasive test for ocular myasthenia gravis that can be performed not only by ophthalmologists or neurologists, but also by other physicians evaluating patients with ptosis, diplopia, or other symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Background Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease involving the neuromuscular junction leading to skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability. In ocular myasthenia gravis (OMG), the symptoms are confined to the extraocular and eyelid muscles. Patients most commonly experience ptosis caused by fatigue of levator palpebrae superioris and/or diplopia due to weakness of extraocular muscles. These symptoms are generally characterized by diurnal fluctuation, worsening with increased use of the eyes and improving with rest. Bienfang‚Äôs test is indicated for patients who are suspected of having OMG. The test was first described by Don Bienfang, a neuro-ophthalmologist at Harvard Medical School. Clinical use and interpretation To perform Bienfang‚Äôs test, the examiner should ensure that the patient is seated comfortably with head and eyes in primary gaze. The examiner is positioned 2‚Äì3 feet in front of the patient‚Äôs face to allow for clear observation of the patient‚Äôs eyes. The patient is instructed to tightly squeeze his or her eyelids shut for five to ten seconds. This not only relaxes the levator palpebrae superioris but actively inhibits it. Simultaneously, it fatigues the orbicularis oculi. The patient then opens his or her eyes and fixates on a target directly ahead, maintaining primary gaze. Hence, the balance between these two opposing muscles may be shifted to a higher lid position. A positive test is defined by excessive upward excursion followed by downward drift of the upper eyelid immediately after the eye opens, in similar fashion to Cogan‚Äôs lid twitch sign. The test is negative if the upper eyelid position remains stable when the eye opens. A positive test is consistent with a diagnosis of OMG. The test may be positive in either ptotic or non-ptotic OMG. The test should be negative in patients with ptosis or diplopia of other etiologies. Bienfang‚Äôs test can help differentiate OMG from other causes of ptosis. For example, although most cases of acquired ptosis in older adults are due to dehiscence of the levator aponeurosis, OMG, which can affect the elderly, cannot be entirely ruled out. In such cases, Bienfang‚Äôs test can be useful. Bienfang‚Äôs test is probably more sensitive than Cogan‚Äôs lid twitch (CLT) test, which may have limited sensitivity and specificity. The forceful closure of the eyelids in Bienfang‚Äôs test may allow for both enhanced rest of the levator muscle and increased fatigue of the orbicularis oculi compared to the sustained downgaze employed in the CLT. A more noticeable overshoot or twitch of the upper eyelid may therefore be observed when the eye is opened. Bienfang‚Äôs test can therefore aid in the detection of mild or subtle cases of OMG, whereas the CLT test may only be positive in individuals with more pronounced disease.

(1585‚Äì1661) was a spiritual writer and religious reformer in 17th-century Flanders. Life Marchant was born at Couvin in what is now Belgium in 1585 and entered the recollect community in that town in 1601, aged 16. He acquired a profound knowledge of scholastic philosophy and theology, and for several years taught in the schools of his order. In 1618 he was appointed guardian of the Ghent convent and introduced the Recollect reform there.T.J. Lamy, \\"Marchant, Pierre\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 13 (Brussels, 1895), 450-454. He represented his province at general chapters of the order in Segovia in 1621 and in Rome in 1625. At the latter general chapter he was elected definitor general of the order. In 1633 and again in 1637 he was visitor of the English Recollects. He was twice elected provincial of the Flemish province. In 1639 was appointed commissary general over the provinces of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Ireland. His duties as commissary general brought him into contact with Irish politics during the times of the Confederation of Kilkenny. He took sides with the Ormondists and gave encouragement to their opposition to the nuncio Giovanni Battista Rinuccini. He was called upon by the authorities of the order to justify his conduct in connection with the Irish question, and in 1661 he addressed to the general chapter then assembled in Rome his apologia under the title of Relatio veridica et sincera status Provinciae Hiberniae. This is a very rare book, never widely circulated and condemned by the general chapter; and ordered to be destroyed. Marchant was a voluminous author. His major work is Tribunal Sacramentale, which contains a full exposition of moral theology for the use of confessors. He puts aside all disputed opinions, and simply states the doctrinal teaching of the Catholic Church, drawing his proofs from Holy Scripture, the decisions of councils, the constant tradition of the Church, and the writings of the saints. The treatise on probabilism is lucid and complete. Its principles are within the restrictions placed on the doctrine later on by the decrees of Alexander VII and Innocent XI; and in many points match the doctrine subsequently propounded by Daniel writing against the Lettres Provinciales. Marchant wrote several works on the cult of St. Joseph. His Sanctificatio S. Joseph Sponsi Virginis in utero asserta (Bruges, [1630]), was placed on the Index, 19 March 1633. His brother James was the author of the Hortus Pastorum. Marchant died in Ghent on 11 November 1661. Works * Sanctificatio S.

It is located 45 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple has three precincts. Shiva is worshipped as Sathya Vageeswarar and his consort Parvathi as Gomathi. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a gateway tower containing 1,500 stucco images. The temple was originally built by Pandyas during the 13th century and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 15-16th century. The temple has artistic sculptures representative of Nayak art. The temple has close to 200 paintings in the temple depicting Indian epic tales. The temple also has a granary made of masonry, which is believed to be commissioned during the 13th century. There is a hall of musical pillars, commissioned by the king of Travancore, Boothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varman during the 16th century. The temple is open from 6 am - 12 pm and 4-8 pm on all days except during festival days when it is open the full day. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikasi Visakam festival during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) being the most prominent.

The inscriptions also indicate that the temple worship services and gifts to the temple were endowed by Marthanda Varman, while he was residing at Virapandiyan Palace. The temple was originally built by Pandyas during the 13th century. The Vijayanagar Empire and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 15-16th century. The temple has artistic sculptures representative of Nayak art. There are lot of paintings in the temple depicting Indian epic tales. There is also an image of the king of Travancore, Boothala Veera Udaya Marthanda Varman from the 16th century. He is believed to have commissioned the musical pillared halls in the front portion of the temple. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. A plaque in front the temple installed on 12 December 1911 indicates the coronation of king George V, when India was ruled by the British. Architecture A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and bodies of water. The temple has a nine- tiered gateway tower containing 1,500 stucco images in the outside, while there are 200 murals from the inside. The nine tiers can be climbed through a flight of steps inside the tower. The image of Sathya Vageeswarar in the form of Lingam is housed in the sanctum. The shrine of his consort is housed in a west facing shrine. The sanctum is approached from the gateway through a flag staff hall, a Mahamandap and an Artha mandap. There are shrines of Vinayaka and Subramanya on the Mahamandap. The first precinct around the sanctum has images of Dakshinamurthy, Vishnu, Durga, Chandikeswara and Navagrahas. The flagstaff hall has a flagstaff, an altar and an image of Nandi, all axial to the sanctum and the gateway tower. There are also halls in the temple having yali pillared halls, atypical of Nayak art. The temple also has a granary made of masonry, which is believed to be commissioned during the 13th century. It is unique that usually temple granaries are made of wood. The stucco images depict various mythical themes related to Shiva. The murals depict stories from epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and also Thiruvilayadal, the divine plays, Shiva's marriage to Parvathi, stories of Saivite saints and wedding of Sundarar. The paintings and stucco images were restored during 2008 when non- governmental organizations rebuilt the plasters with vegetable colours and natural ingredients. Historians believe that the paintings have a modern look and depicts the contemporary style of dress and ornaments worn during the period. Festival The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai between 8:00  8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Sathya Vageeswarar and Gomathi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. The Vaikasi Visakam festival during the Tamil month of Vaikasi (May - June) being the most prominent. During the festival, the temple chariot is drawn around the streets of Kalakkad, with the festival images of Sathya Vageeswar and Gomathi housed in it. Other festivals like Sivarathri, Thirukalyanam (sacred marriage) and Kanthasasthi are also celebrated.

It stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Lil Rel Howery, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Stephen Root, Catherine Keener, and Lakeith Stanfield. Get Out follows Chris Washington (Kaluuya), a young African-American man who uncovers a disturbing secret when he meets the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Williams). Principal photography began in February 2016 in Fairhope, Alabama, then moved to Barton Academy and the Ashland Place Historic District in Mobile, Alabama. The entire film was shot in 23 days. Get Out premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2017, and was theatrically released in the United States on February 24, 2017, by Universal Pictures. It received positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at Peele's direction and screenplay, Kaluuya's performance and its themes. It was also a massive commercial success, grossing $255 million worldwide on a $4.5 million budget, with a net profit of $124.8 million, making it the tenth-most profitable film of 2017. It was chosen by the National Board of Review, the American Film Institute and Time as one of the top 10 films of the year. At the 90th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for four awards, including Best Picture; Peele won for Best Original Screenplay. It also earned five nominations at the 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, two at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, and two at the 71st British Academy Film Awards. It has been featured in multiple listings of the best films of the 2010s.  Plot  Photographer Chris Washington is apprehensive as he prepares to meet the family of his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage. Later, at the Armitage house in rural Upstate New York, Rose's brother Jeremy and their parents, neurosurgeon Dean and hypnotherapist Missy, make disconcerting comments about black people. Chris witnesses strange behavior from the estate's black housekeeper Georgina and groundskeeper Walter. When Chris is unable to sleep, Missy pressures him into a hypnotherapy session to cure his smoking addiction. In a trance, he expresses guilt over his mother's death in a hit-and-run when he was a child, and sinks into a void Missy calls the \\"Sunken Place\\". The next morning, he assumes that the encounter was a dream until Walter acknowledges their brief encounter the night before. Georgina unplugs his phone \\"accidentally\\", draining its battery. Dozens of wealthy white people arrive for the Armitages' annual get-together. They express admiration for Chris's physique and for black figures such as Tiger Woods. Jim Hudson, a blind art dealer, takes a particular interest in Chris's photography skills. Chris meets another black man, Logan King, who behaves strangely and is married to a much older white woman. Chris calls his friend, TSA officer Rod Williams, about the strange behavior. Chris tries to photograph Logan inconspicuously, but when his flash goes off, Logan becomes hysterical, shouting at Chris to \\"get out\\". The others restrain him and Dean claims that Logan had an epileptic seizure. Away from the party, Chris convinces Rose that they should leave. Meanwhile, Dean holds an auction with a photo of Chris, which Hudson wins. Rod recognizes \\"Logan\\" as Andre Hayworth, a missing man. Suspecting a conspiracy, Rod goes to the police, but no one believes him. While Chris packs to leave, he finds photos of Rose in prior relationships with black people, including Walter and Georgina, contradicting her claim that Chris is her first black boyfriend. He tries to leave the house, but Rose and her family block him. Chris attacks Jeremy, but Missy uses a \\"trigger\\" that she implanted during his hypnosis, knocking him out. Chris awakens strapped to a chair in the basement. In a video presentation, Rose's grandfather Roman explains that the family transplants their brains into others' bodies, granting them preferred physical characteristics and a twisted form of immortality. Hudson tells Chris the host's consciousness remains in the Sunken Place, conscious but powerless. Although the Armitages target mainly black people, Hudson reveals he wants Chris's body only for sight and his photography skills. Missy performs hypnosis, seemingly knocking Chris out. When Jeremy comes to fetch Chris for the surgery, Chris bludgeons him unconscious, having blocked the hypnosis by plugging his ears with cotton stuffing pulled from the chair. He impales Dean with the antlers of a deer mount, causing Dean to knock over a candle, setting fire to the operating room with Hudson inside. Chris kills Missy but is attacked by Jeremy as he heads towards the door; he overpowers and kills Jeremy before leaving in his car, but hits Georgina. Remembering his mother's death, he carries Georgina into the car. However, possessed by Rose's grandmother Marianne, she attacks him. During the struggle the car crashes, killing her. Rose apprehends him with Walter, who is possessed by Roman. Chris uses the flash on his phone to neutralize Roman, allowing Walter to regain control of his body. Walter takes Rose's rifle, shoots her in the stomach, and shoots himself, killing both him and Roman. Chris begins to strangle Rose, but stops when a police cruiser pulls onto the scene. Rod steps out of the cruiser and rescues Chris, leaving Rose bleeding out on the road.

Production = Development  Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut. Get Out is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, who had previously worked in comedy, including the sketch show Key & Peele. He felt the horror and comedy genres are similar in that \\"so much of it is pacing, so much of it [hinges on] reveals\\", and that comedy gave him \\"something of a training\\" for the film. The Stepford Wives (1975) provided inspiration, about which Peele said, \\"it's a horror movie but has a satirical premise.\\" As the film deals with racism, Peele has stated that the story is \\"very personal\\", although he noted that \\"it quickly veers off from anything autobiographical.\\" Peele was introduced to producer Sean McKittrick by comedy partner Keegan-Michael Key in 2013. \\"I was shooting a movie with Keegan- Michael Key. He said, 'You gotta meet Jordan, he's a horror fanatic and he has all these ideas.' Jordan and I met for coffee in New Orleans. He said, 'Here‚Äôs one you‚Äôll never want to make,' and he pitched me the whole story. I'd never seen that movie before. It fascinated me. So I said right at the table, 'Okay, I‚Äôm going to buy this pitch and pay you to write it.' I think he was a little shocked.\\" Peele wrote the first draft of the script in two months.  Casting  Allison Williams was cast to disorient audiences into trusting her. The lead actors, Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams, were cast in November 2015, with other roles cast between December 2015 and February 2016. Kaluuya was cast based on the strength of his performance in Black Mirror episode \\"Fifteen Million Merits\\". \\"That party sequence is why I really wanted to do this film, because I've been to that party,\\" Kaluuya told the Los Angeles Times. \\"He [Chris] feels like an everyman. He's kind of like J. Cole. Chris is that guy that everyone knows, who has been in everyone's class at school. That good guy from around the area.\\" Williams said she was cast by Peele as a sneaky gambit to disorient audiences. \\"Jordan told me that he had always pictured me as Rose because Peter Pan or Marnie would make it easier for people to trust me,\\" Williams noted. \\"I was looking for a role that would weaponize everything that people take for granted about me. So I instantly signed on to it.\\" Williams observed that white audiences frequently misinterpret the motivations of her character Rose. \\"They'd say 'she was hypnotized, right?' And I'm like, no! She's just evil! How hard is that to accept? She's bad! We gave you so many ways to know that she's bad! She has photos of people whose lives she ended behind her! The minute she can, she hangs them back up on the wall behind her. That's so crazy! And they're still like, 'but maybe she's also a victim?' And I'm like, NO! No! And I will say, that is one hundred percent white people who say that to me.\\" The scene where Rose drinks milk while looking at potential future victims was conceived shortly before shooting to add an additional creepy element to her character. The music used in the scene, \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\", was intended to reflect Rose's emotional detachment. \\"There's something kind of horrific about milk,\\" Peele said. \\"Think about it! Think about what we're doing. Milk is kind of gross.\\"  Filming  Principal photography began on February 16, 2016. Shooting took place in Fairhope, Alabama, for three weeks, followed by Barton Academy and in the Ashland Place Historic District in midtown Mobile, Alabama. Principal photography lasted 23 days.The film was partially shot at Barton Academy, a historic Greek Revival school building in Mobile, Alabama. Peele described conceptualizing the \\"sunken place\\" as an impassioned journey in an interview with Vanity Fair. \\"I always had this concept of the place that you‚Äôre falling toward when you‚Äôre going to sleep, and you get that falling sensation and catch yourself. And if you didn‚Äôt catch yourself, where would you end up? I had this hellish image, and I thought of this idea of, 'What if you were in a place, and you could look through your own eyes as if they were literal windows or a screen, and see what your body was seeing, but feel like a prisoner in your own mind‚Äîthe chamber of your mind?'\\" Peele explained. \\"The moment I thought of that, it immediately occurred to me the theme of abduction and connection to the prison industrial complex that this movie was sort of presenting a metaphor for. It was a very emotional discovery. I remember having so much fun writing it, but at that moment when I figured out this weird, esoteric, but also an emotionally brutal form of suffering to put the character through‚ÄîI literally cried writing the scene.\\" Lil Rel Howery says the allegorical symbolism in the film is strongly entrenched in the fear historically experienced by African Americans. \\"It goes back to the way I grew up; I‚Äôm just being honest,\\" Howery explained. \\"Segregation created this. Stories about people like Emmett Till. It's history; crazy things have happened, so people are going to embellish and pass that onto their kids as a warning. Jordan was so smart to hit on all these stories that could be considered myths, but a lot of it is rooted in truth.\\" Peele was worried about the film's chances of success, telling the Los Angeles Times, \\"What if white people don't want to come to see the movie because they're afraid of being villainized with black people in the crowd? What if black people don't want to see the movie because they don't want to sit next to a white person while a black person is being victimized on-screen?‚Äù  Alternative endings  In the original ending, Chris is arrested by the police after strangling Rose. Instead of rescuing Chris, Rod meets him in jail and asks him for information about the Armitage family to investigate, but Chris insists that he stopped them and everything is fine. Peele intended this ending to reflect the realities of racism. By the time production had begun, however, several high- profile police shootings of black people had made discussion, in Peele's words, \\"more woke\\". After gauging reception at test screenings, he decided the film needed a happy ending, but felt a moment when the audience believes Chris is about to be arrested would preserve the intended reaction. Peele considered several other endings, some of which are included on the DVD and Blu-ray release. In one ending, Rod breaks into the estate, finds Chris, and calls his name, but Chris responds, \\"I assure you, I don't know who you're talking about.\\"  Music  Michael Abels composed the film's score, which Peele wanted to have \\"distinctly black voices and black musical references.\\" This proved to be a challenge, as Peele found that African-American music typically has what he termed \\"at the very least, a glimmer of hope to it.\\" At the same time, Peele also wanted to avoid having a voodoo motif. The final score features Swahili voices as well as a blues influence. \\"Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga\\" is a Swahili phrase that translates to \\"listen to (your) ancestors,\\" which indicates to the listener, \\"something bad is coming. Run.\\" \\"The words are issuing a warning to Chris,\\" Peele said. \\"The whole idea of the movie is 'Get out!'‚Äîit's what we're screaming at the character on-screen.\\" The song \\"Redbone\\" by Childish Gambino appears at the movie's beginning. Other songs in the film include \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" by Flanagan and Allen and \\"(I've Had) The Time of My Life\\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes. The soundtrack was released on vinyl for the first time in 2018 by Waxwork Records and included an exclusive essay by Peele.  Themes  The Guardian wrote: \\"The villains here aren't southern rednecks or neo-Nazi skinheads, or the so-called 'alt- right'. They're middle-class white liberals. The kind of people who read this website. The kind of people who shop at Trader Joe's, donate to the ACLU and would have voted for Obama a third time if they could. The thing Get Out does so well ‚Äì and the thing that will rankle with some viewers ‚Äì is to show how, however unintentionally, these same people can make life so hard and uncomfortable for black people. It exposes a liberal ignorance and hubris that has been allowed to fester. It's an attitude, an arrogance which in the film leads to a horrific final solution, but in reality leads to a complacency that is just as dangerous.\\" Peele said about the film, \\"The real thing at hand here is slavery ... It's some dark shit.\\" Peele stated that the character of Hudson, who \\"is the farthest from racist\\" due to his blindness, \\"still plays a part in the system of racism. And the way it manifests in that movie is, yeah, a guy who believes that the eye of this better artist, this black artist, is what‚Äôs separating him from being a success or a failure. Which also, to me, is a commentary on a sentiment I was hearing a lot during the Obama era, this whole mythology of a [purported] advantage of being black in this culture.\\" The film also depicts the lack of attention on missing black Americans compared to missing white females. Slates Damon Young stated the film's premise was \\"depressingly plausible ... Although black people only comprise 13 percent of America's population, they are 34 percent of America's missing, a reality that exists as the result of a m√©lange of racial and socioeconomic factors rendering black lives demonstratively less valuable than the lives [of] our white counterparts.\\" Peele wrote Rose as a subversion of the white savior trope, and in particular, of films where most white characters are evil, but one is good. Peele and Williams stated that Rose behaved like a teenager as her emotional development was delayed.Yamato, Jen. \\"Jordan Peele explains 'Get Out's' creepy milk scene, ponders the recent link between dairy and hate.\\" Los Angeles Times. March 1, 2017. Retrieved on March 21, 2018. \\"She and Peele even coined a name for Rose's true self. \\"We started to refer to her as Ro Ro,\\" Williams said. [...]\\" and \\"\\"Oh my God. Well, I intended that,\\" he joked of the uncannily prescient timing to milk's sudden surge in popularity with white supremacists.\\" Williams believed that Rose was not a victim of indoctrination, hypnotism or Stockholm syndrome, but simply evil. After Rose's intentions are revealed, her previous \\"soft and welcoming\\" appearance becomes a \\"vision of cold, meticulous elitism\\", with hunting jodhpurs, a white dress shirt, and a \\"sleek ponytail\\"; she hangs photographs of her ex-partners on her wall like hunting trophies.  Reception = Box office  Get Out grossed $176 million in the United States and Canada and $79.4 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $255.5 million, against a production budget of $4.5 million. Deadline Hollywood calculated the net profit of the film to be $124.8 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the 10th most profitable release of 2017. Vulture described Get Outs 56.6 multiple as \\"staggering\\". In North America, Get Out was released on February 24, 2017, alongside Collide and Rock Dog, and was expected to gross $20‚Äì25 million from 2,773 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $1.8 million from Thursday night previews and $10.8 million on its first day. It went on to open for $33.4 million, finishing first at the box office. Thirty- eight percent of the film's opening-weekend audience was African American, while 35% was white, with Georgia being its most profitable market. 90% of its opening weekend ticket sales were purchased at the theater (versus in advance). In its second weekend, the film finished in second at the box office behind new release Logan ($88.4 million), grossing $28.3 million, for a drop of 15.4%. Horror films tend to drop at least 60% in their second weekend, so this was above average. In its third weekend, the film grossed $21.1 million, dropping just 25% from its previous week, and finished third at the box office behind newcomer Kong: Skull Island and Logan. In March 2017, three weeks after its release, Get Out crossed the $100 million mark domestically, making Peele the first black writer-director to do so with his debut movie. On April 8, 2017, the film became the highest-grossing film domestically directed by a black filmmaker, beating out F. Gary Gray's Straight Outta Compton, which grossed $162.8 million domestically in 2015. Gray reclaimed the record two weeks later when The Fate of the Furious grossed $173.3 million on its fourteenth day of release on April 27. Domestically, Get Out is also the highest-grossing debut film based on an original screenplay in Hollywood history, beating the two-decade-long record of 1999's The Blair Witch Project ($140.5 million). By the end of March, Los Angeles Times had declared the film's success a \\"cultural phenomenon\\" noting that in addition to its box office success, \\"moviegoers have shared countless 'sunken place' Internet memes and other Get Out-inspired fan art across social media.\\" Josh Rottenberg, the editor of the piece, attributed the film's success to the fact that it was released \\"at one of the most politically charged moments in memory.\\"  Critical response  Daniel Kaluuya's performance garnered critical acclaim and he received his first Academy Award, BAFTA, Golden Globe & SAG nomination. On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 98% based on 386 reviews, and an average rating of 8.35/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Funny, scary, and thought- provoking, Get Out seamlessly weaves its trenchant social critiques into a brilliantly effective and entertaining horror/comedy thrill ride.\\" The film held a 100% approval rating after the first 139 reviews on the site were registered. It was also the highest rated wide release of 2017 on the site. On Metacritic, the film has an average weighted score of 84 out of 100, based on 48 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave an 84% overall positive score and a 66% \\"definite recommend\\". Richard Roeper gave the film 3 stars, saying: \\"the real star of the film is writer-director Jordan Peele, who has created a work that addresses the myriad levels of racism, pays homage to some great horror films, carves out its own creative path, has a distinctive visual style‚Äîand is flat- out funny as well.\\" Keith Phipps of Uproxx praised the cast and Peele's direction, saying, \\"That he brings the technical skill of a practiced horror master is more of a surprise. The final thrill of Get Out‚Äîbeyond the slow- building sense of danger, the unsettling atmosphere, and the twisty revelation of what's really going on‚Äîis that Peele's just getting started.\\" Mike Rougeau of IGN gave the film 9/10, and wrote, \\"Get Outs whole journey, through every tense conversation, A-plus punchline and shocking act of violence, feels totally earned. And the conclusion is worth each uncomfortable chuckle and moment of doubt.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave Get Out a 3.5 out of 4, and called it a \\"jolt-a-minute horrorshow laced with racial tension and stinging satirical wit.\\" Scott Mendelson of Forbes said the film captured the zeitgeist and called it a \\"modern American horror classic\\". Critic Armond White, who is African American, gave a negative review in National Review, referring to the film as a \\"Get-Whitey movie\\" and stating that it \\"[reduces] racial politics to trite horror-comedy ... it's an Obama movie for Tarantino fans.\\" The New York Observer critic Rex Reed included the film on his list of 10 Worst Films of 2017, and later sardonically stated in a CBS Sunday Morning interview, \\"I didn't care if all the black men are turned into robots.\\" A writer on Sunday Mornings website noted that there are no robots in the film. Get Out divided Oscar voters, with many older members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences dismissing it or choosing not to see it. According to Vulture, new voting members said they ran into \\"interference\\" from more senior members when it came to evaluating the film as Best Picture. \\"I had multiple conversations with longtime Academy members who were like, 'That was not an Oscar film,'\\" according to a new voter. \\"Honestly, a few of them had not even seen it and they were saying it, so dispelling that kind of thing has been super important.\\" One anonymous Oscar voter told The Hollywood Reporter they felt alienated by the Oscar campaign: \\"Instead of focusing on the fact that this was an entertaining little horror movie that made quite a bit of money, they started trying to suggest it had deeper meaning than it does, and, as far as I'm concerned, they played the race card, and that really turned me off. In fact, at one of the luncheons, the lead actor [Kaluuya], who is not from the United States, was giving us a lecture on racism in America and how black lives matter, and I thought, 'What does this have to do with Get Out? They're trying to make me think that if I don't vote for this movie, I'm a racist.' I was really offended.\\"  Accolades  At the 90th Academy Awards, the film earned four nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Actor for Daniel Kaluuya. Peele became the third person (after Warren Beatty and James L. Brooks) to earn Best Picture, Director and Screenplay nominations for a debut film, and the first black winner for Best Original Screenplay (and fourth overall nominated, after John Singleton, Spike Lee, and Suzanne de Passe). At the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Get Out received two nominations: Best Motion Picture ‚Äì Musical or Comedy and Best Actor ‚Äì Comedy or Musical for Daniel Kaluuya. The submission in the comedy category prompted debate about the premise of the film. Although advertised as a \\"satirical horror film,\\" Universal Pictures submitted it as a comedy because of less competition in the category, which gave the film a greater chance of receiving accolades. Peele joked in a tweet, \\"'Get Out' is a documentary,\\" but it was reported he approved of the submission. The film also received nominations at the 24th Screen Actors Guild Awards, 49th NAACP Image Awards, and 23rd Critics' Choice Awards, among others. It won Best Foreign International Film at the British Independent Film Awards. At the 33rd Independent Spirit Awards on March 3, 2018, Jordan Peele won the Best Director Award and the film won Best Picture.

located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Its McGlohon Theater in the former First Baptist Church on North Tryon Street, named for Loonis McGlohon, is now part of North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. History McGlohon Theatre Duke Energy Theater Spirit Square opened in 1976 as an arts center offering dance, visual arts, theater and music. In 1972, First Baptist Church announced it was selling its buildings on North Tryon Street. In November 1974, Ferebee, Walters, and Associates said the cost of converting the old church into an arts center would be $1 million. In April 1975, a 100-member cultural arts committee asked Mecklenburg County commissioners to buy the buildings, which consultant Ralph Burgard said would improve the area. Commissioners voted to spend $335,000 to buy the buildings. A six-month study by Spirit Square Development Group, chaired by Alex McMillan, resulted in a plan to spend $300,000 to renovate the education building on Seventh Street, and $2.5 million on the sanctuary. On June 1, 1976, the property was leased to Spirit Square Arts Council Corp. for 25 years. County voters approved $2.5 million in bonds in April 1977. In January 1980 after a $200,000 grant from NCNB, the 800-seat theater was named NCNB Performance Place. Joel Grey performed at the black tie opening ceremony April 15, 1980. Knight Gallery opened in November 1983 with 2,900 square feet, the city's first nonprofit gallery for contemporary visual art. In November 1985, the city gave Spirit Square $2.7 million for a renovation. As Spirit Square prepared to celebrate its 10th anniversary, a fund-raising campaign began in May 1986 for the rest of the $5.5 million expected cost. A $6.5 million renovation and 7,300-square-foot addition completed in 1990 gave the arts center the building that had been desired since it began, and a new entrance at 345 North College Street. Middleton McMillan architects had to use five buildings built between 1908 and 1980, some that were part of the church, and one which had been a printing plant. Ceiling heights and floor materials changed in the different buildings, making renovation challenging, and $400,000 had to be spent to remove asbestos after an estimate of only $75,000, due to incorrect plans. With changes in the interior design, the total space increased from 80,000 to 100,000 square feet. A carved rosette arch at the new entrance recalled J.M. McMichael, the architect of First Baptist. Stained glass from the church was taken out of storage and used to add character and recall history. With the opening of the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center in 1992, uptown Charlotte had a new location for performances. This led to a decreased role for Spirit Square as a location for events. In August 1995, Spirit Square agreed to a Charlotte-Mecklenburg Arts & Science Council recommendation to convert to an arts education center. In December of that year, it was announced that Spirit Square Center for Arts and Education would be taken over by the Blumenthal organization June 30, 1997. The 720-seat NationsBank Performance Place was named Loonis McGlohon Theatre for Loonis McGlohon in a January 9, 1998 event. Other venues began taking over some of the events. Great Aunt Stella Center became the new home of cultural festivals and many of the musical acts. Chamber music moved to local colleges. Soon the renamed theatre was seeing less use, partly because it was too small, but Children's Theatre of Charlotte had some performances there. By 1999, the 30-year-old Community School of the Arts was the main tenant. Actor's Theatre still used the 180-seat Duke Power Theatre, and North Carolina Dance Theatre used part of the space. Tryon Center for Visual Art used the galleries, and groups not related to the arts were renting space. For example, once again, the former church was being used as a church. In 2007, Mecklenburg County wanted to sell part of the Spirit Square complex, but not McGlohon Theatre or Duke Power Theatre. In June 2006, commissioners voted to end subsidies that had reached $1.4 million a year. Instead, the county's focus would be on the new Wachovia cultural campus on South Tryon Street. By this time, Opera Carolina, Northwest School of the Arts and The Light Factory were using space and their futures were uncertain. The 15-member Spirit Square Community Task Force began working to find a way to maximize the site's potential and still keep the historic character. Originally, the sale of the property would have helped to pay for the new uptown baseball stadium, and arts groups would have had to leave, but a different financing method was used for the stadium. Opera Carolina did leave and Northwest School was considering it. Expansion of the library's main branch next door had to be considered, since the library might use part of the property. In 2008, a plan was announced to build a new main library and a 15-story tower while keeping McGlohon Theatre.

Most of its buildings are modest vernacular wood frame buildings, erected between 1830 and 1935; there are a few apartment blocks, and one church. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The Canal Street‚ÄìClark Street area is located southwest of Brattleboro's downtown on the south side of Canal Street (United States Route 5). The area is effectively bounded by Canal Street to the north, South Main Street to the east, and the slopes of Prospect Hill to the south. A small network of streets in this area, including Clark Street, Lawrence Street, and Estabrook Road, make up the neighborhood. Most of the housing in this area is wood frame construction, in vernacular renditions of styles popular at the time of their construction, although there are three masonry (brick or stone) buildings. There are only a few houses with elaborate decorative elements, and there are also only a small number of purpose-built multiunit buildings. The district's only non-residential building is the 1850-51 Greek Revival First Universalist Church on Canal Street. Brattleboro's center area was first settled in the 18th century, but saw significant growth beginning in the 1820s, with the advent first of river-based transport (on the Connecticut River), and then the railroad, which arrived in 1849. Canal Street was laid out sometime before 1845, paralleling the canal along Whetstone Brook that provided power to the town's industries. Some of the district's oldest houses were built along the south side of Canal Street. Clark Street, which mostly parallels Canal Street, was laid out 1845-52, and was named for Joseph Clark, the early landowner of the area. It was built to provide access to the rear of the long and narrow lots on which the early houses were built, for the purpose of subdivision. Lawrence and Estabrook Streets were also built around that time. By the late 19th century the area had been mostly built out, and a period of redevelopment saw the construction of multiunit housing, mainly along the principal roads. The Abbott, at Canal and South Main, was built in 1911; it is a large multiunit brick apartment block with commercial spaces on the ground floor.

Jules Albert Louppe (6 June 1856 ‚Äì 5 July 1927) was a French explosives engineer who became a politician. The Plougastel Bridge, or Albert-Louppe Bridge, near Brest in north-western France, is named after him. Life=Early years Jules Albert Louppe was born into a peasant family in Guny, in the French department of Aisne. His schooling commenced nearby at Soissons, from where he won a place at the prestigious Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe in Paris, later progressing to the national √âcole Polytechnique. At the age of 19 he emerged from the √âcole Polytechnique as a qualified explosives engineer. The industrialist By 1883 he had relocated to Finist√®re, where he became the General Director of the \\"Moulin- Blanc\\" (explosives) Powder mill in the Costour Valley at Le Relecq-Kerhuon near Brest. He later moved on to take over the Powder mill at Pont-de-Buis, but returned in 1905 to the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\", where working now as Chief Engineer, he remained till 1911. Scandal Louppe's involvement in the manufacture of gunpowder brought him unwelcome publicity in the national press following the explosions of the battleships I√©na in 1907 and Libert√© in 1911. The Libert√© explosion also caused extensive damage to other battleships anchored nearby in Toulon Harbour. Following lengthy investigation, the cause of the explosion was traced back to \\"Powder B\\" (Nitrocellulose gunpowder), recently introduced to battleship guns during the arms race at the beginning of the twentieth century, which was determined to have become unstable over time. Bitter and very public arguments erupted between L√©opold Maissin and Albert Louppe. Maissin had succeeded Loupe as director of the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" powder mill, and the kernel of the argument was over whether sub-standard ingredients delivered to the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" plant by the \\"Pont-de-Buis\\" had caused the resulting Powder B produced by the \\"Moulin-Blanc\\" plant to become unstable. Loupe and Maissin each blamed one another and the national press ran with the story. Although the two men shifted their positions, the very public rancour between them continued, and in the end both men were retired from their directorships. Albert Louppe was urged by the government to take over the Powder mill at Saint-M√©dard, but he declined the offer, preferring, at least for the time being, to retire. The rivalry with L√©opold Maissin was both professional and political. Albert Louppe was non-aligned, but by most criteria a conservative left-winger, while Maissin was a Radical-Socialist Republican. Their antipathy was played out not merely in the media, but also in the departmental council of Finist√®re to which both had been elected as regional deputies, and where Louppe represented the canton of Faou between 1901 and 1927. The politician After a period as a town councillor in Guipavas from 1884, in 1888 Louppe was elected a municipal councillor in Quimerc'h, subsequently becoming mayor of the little commune, an office he would retain, in tandem with his other duties, till his death. In addition to his work in municipal politics, he was elected to the departmental council of Finist√®re in 1901, becoming president of the council in 1912. He worked hard to obtain government funding for major transport links and for improvements at the (strategically important) Port of Brest. In 1922 he mandated the first studies for a possible bridge to provide a direct connection from Plougastel- Daoulas to Brest, crossing over the √âlorn estuary. Work on the bridge started in 1926. Louppe did not live to see it completed, but when it was opened to traffic in 1930 the bridge was nevertheless named after him. Louppe's career in national politics took off in 1914 when he was elected a Deputy representing the second electoral district (Ch√¢teaulin) of Finist√®re, in the process unseating the anti-Dreyfusard Charles Dani√©lou. In the Chamber he sat with the Radical Left group, and backed the Clemenceau government for all the important votes. His name was not included on the candidates listing for the 1919 election.Jean Pascal, Dictionnaire des d√©put√©s bretons de 1789 √† 1983, PUF, 1983. In 1921 he was elected to the Senate for Finist√®re. In the senate he sat with the Republican left. He played an important role in the Commission of Public Works. Personal On 11 December 1885, at Brest, Albert Louppe married Hortense Gabrielle Steff, the daughter of a wine merchant originally from Moselle, in the east. However, following the Franco-Prussian War and the frontier changes mandated in the Treaty of Frankfurt, the Steffs had found themselves living in Germany. Families were given until October 1872 to decide whether they wished to become Germans or to retain their French citizenship and relocate to what remained of France. It was in response to this choice that Henriette Catherine Steff and her family relocated to Brest. Following their marriage, Albert and Hortense Louppe had four recorded children. Albert Louppe died just outside Laval in July 1927 while visiting friends. He had been predeceased by his wife a couple of years earlier, and was buried with her in the Steff family burial plot at the Cemetery of St Martin (Square 16) in Brest.

It was broadcast on Showtime on December 20, 2015.  Plot  Carrie (Claire Danes) tracks down Qasim (Alireza Bayram) in the subway tracks. She convinces an already hesitant Qasim to intervene in Bibi's (Ren√© Ifrah) releasing of the sarin gas. Carrie offers her gun but Qasim is only willing to try and talk Bibi out of it. Qasim is shot by Bibi when he refuses to back down, and tackles Bibi in response. Carrie approaches and shoots Bibi in the back as they struggle, killing him and neutralizing the threat. Qasim succumbs to his wounds. With Allison on the run, Saul (Mandy Patinkin) presses Krupin (Mark Ivanir) for details on what her extraction procedure would be. Saul notes that with Allison having abandoned the CIA, Krupin no longer has a viable claim to being her informant. Saul makes an offer to Krupin: a new identity and witness protection in exchange for the information he wants. Krupin accepts. Numan (Atheer Adel) is apprehended by the BND. By threatening to have Numan deported to Turkey (where he is now an enemy of the state), Astrid (Nina Hoss) coerces Laura (Sarah Sokolovic) into making a false public declaration that Faisal Marwan had been working with the terrorist cell in Berlin. Carrie attempts to reopen her relationship with Jonas (Alexander Fehling). Jonas declines, saying he can't live with the safety of his family in doubt, recalling what happened to his son. Saul makes overtures to Carrie to rejoin the CIA, offering her the power to choose her own missions and team members. Carrie repeatedly rebuffs him, saying \\"I'm not that person any more\\". Otto D√ºring essentially proposes to Carrie, which would allow her to co-head the Foundation and help him use his money for good. Allison's (Miranda Otto) handlers try to smuggle her out of the country in the trunk of their car. The car is diverted to a detour in Poland where it runs over a spike strip. A group of gunmen unload hundreds of bullets into the disabled car, killing all inside. Saul emerges from the shadows and checks the trunk of the car, finding Allison's dead body riddled with bullets. Quinn (Rupert Friend) suffers a massive brain hemorrhage, making his chance of recovering any brain function minimal. Dar Adal (F. Murray Abraham) presents Carrie with the letter Quinn wrote for her before he embarked for Syria. After several days with no signs of recovery, Carrie enters Quinn's hospital room alone and barricades the door closed. She removes Quinn's pulse monitor and places it on her own finger. The episode ends with Carrie seeing a burst of sunlight come through the window.  Production  The episode was directed by executive producer Lesli Linka Glatter and co-written by showrunner Alex Gansa, co-executive producer Ron Nyswaner, and Liz Flahive in her first writing credit for the series. Climactic scenes of the episode, in which a major terrorist attack on Berlin is attempted, were filmed the day after the November 2015 Paris attacks occurred. Gansa and Glatter both commented on the disquiet that the real-life events caused on set. Rupert Friend wrote the text of the letter that Quinn had left for Carrie.  Reception = Reviews  The episode received a rating of 71% with an average score of 7.7 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating \\"By tying up the terror plot early in 'A False Glimmer,' Homelands fifth season comes to an uncharacteristically quiet ending\\". IGN's Scott Collura rated the episode 9.0 out of 10, saying in summary that it \\"really managed to bring just about every element of the season to a thoughtful and emotionally satisfying close\\". Shirley Li of Entertainment Weekly positively reviewed the episode, and said of the final scene \\"I liked this ending for the way it concentrated back on Carrie and on the effect Quinn has on her\\". Cynthia Littleton of Variety remarked that it \\"maintains the breathtaking pace of a thriller\\" despite its focus on character moments, and added that \\"it‚Äôs the work turned in by Claire Danes, who never ceases to impress with her dexterity, that makes the whole thing tick\\". Judith Warner of The New York Times had a more negative take, concluding that \\"the whole thing just had the feel of a desperate race to the close\\".  Ratings  The original broadcast was watched by 2.07 million viewers, making it the most-watched episode of the season.

He is the creator of \\"Doggy John\\" series of sculptures.  Biography  Julien Marinetti was born on 19 January 1967, in Paris. He spent his childhood in the neighborhood of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, next to the School of Fine Arts, which he attended a few years later. He also worked at the workshops of artists Paul Belmondo and Edmond Heuz√©, in the same area. Later, he studied the nude at the Acad√©mie de la Grande Chaumi√®re and developed a great interest in the academic drawing. In 1997, a meeting with the painter Jean Dewasne became a turning point for Marinetti. He discovered the constructive abstraction concepts and antisculptures. . His first exhibitions in the 1990s (Salon des Independants, Salon de la Jeune Peinture etc.) were focused on the reinterpretation of the major issues of religious painting - Crucifixion, Transfiguration, Adam and Eve in different styles; classicism, realism, figuration libre. In 2004, he returned to sculpture and invented \\"Doggy John\\", a bronze bulldog on which he applies a pictorial treatment, mixing painting and sculpture. He developed a syncretism of art where the sculpture is not a figurative object by itself but becomes the support of a pictorial work. In 2007, his work \\"Doggy John-Obama\\" was presented at the Grand Palais. Since then, his sculptures have been exhibited in several countries and galleries worldwide. B√¢ pandas In 2009 and 2010, while exploring the relationship between painting and sculpture, he created other models - \\"Skull\\" (a human skull), Kwak (a duck) and Popy (a teddy bear).http://www.od-art.com/expo_2012_clarus.html His stay in Asia in 2011 led him to imagine the B√¢ family of pandas, which are found in the cities of Singapore and Chengdu.  Artistic style  Julien Marinetti is known for his syncretic approach that treats the bronze object as a three-dimensional painting, expressing a figurative art. Drawn then sculpted in clay each model, he uses bronze as his primary material. The lacquer enhances colors of his sculptures. Doggy John the bulldog, Kwak the duck, Popy the teddy bear, and B√¢ the panda feature in several of his works.

He played college football at Michigan, where he was named First-Team All-American and First-Team All-Big Ten in 2015 and 2016. Lewis was drafted by the Cowboys in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft. Early years Lewis was raised in Detroit, where he attended and played high school football at Cass Technical High School. As a junior, he tallied eight interceptions and 11 touchdowns. As a senior, he had 751 receiving yards, six touchdowns and 742 return yards with three touchdowns on special teams. He and Lano Hill anchored the Cass Technical defensive backfield that won back-to-back (2011 and 2012) Michigan High School Athletic Association Division 1 championships for coach Thomas Wilcher. College career Lewis accepted a football scholarship from the University of Michigan. As a freshman he appeared in 13 games, registering 17 tackles and two passes defensed. As a sophomore, he appeared in 12 games (seven starts), collecting 39 tackles, 28 solo tackles, 1.5 tackles for loss, two interceptions and six passes defensed. He was named a starter in the third game of the season. As a junior, he started 13 games, posting 52 tackles (3.5 for loss), two interceptions and 20 passes defensed (ranked third in the FBS). He also averaged 25.2 yards on kickoff returns. As a senior, he missed the first 3 games with injuries to his back, hamstring and quad. Through the first 10 games of the 2015 season, Lewis had 20 pass breakups, which set a new school record. He ranked second among all players in the NCAA Division I FBS with 21 passes defended. Lewis set a single-season school record with 21 pass breakups in 2015, surpassing the previous record of 18 held by Marlin Jackson (2002) and Leon Hall (2006). Following the 2015 season, Lewis was named to the All-Big Ten defensive first-team, by both the media and coaches. He was also named a First-Team All-American by USA Today, and Sports Illustrated, becoming the first Wolverine to earn the honor since Taylor Lewan in 2013, and the first Wolverine defensive back to earn the honor since Leon Hall in 2006. During the 2016 season, Lewis was targeted 31 times, allowing 74 yards, with 14 total yards after catch and 0.36 yards per snap in coverage. Lewis has contributed 23 tackles, 3.5 tackles-for-loss, two interceptions and 12 pass breakups this season. Following the 2016 season, Lewis was named the Tatum‚ÄìWoodson Defensive Back of the Year, and was once again named to the All- Big Ten defensive first-team, by both the media and coaches. He was also named a first-team All-American by the Walter Camp Football Foundation, Associated Press, Sporting News, and Sports Illustrated. Professional career On January 10, 2017, it was reported that Lewis and teammates Chris Wormley and Ben Gedeon had all accepted their invitations to attend the 2017 Senior Bowl. On January 28, 2017, he recorded four combined tackles and displayed impressive coverage under Chicago Bears' head coach John Fox as a part of the North team who lost 16-15 to the South. As a top ten cornerback prospect, Lewis was invited to the NFL combine. He attended and performed the majority of drills, but opted to skip the short shuttle and three-cone drill. On March 18, he opted to participate at Michigan's Pro Day. Lewis chose to run his 40-yard dash (4.47), 20-yard dash (2.51), 10-yard dash (1.59), short shuttle (4.38), and three-cone drill (6.88) for representatives and scouts from all 32 NFL teams. On March 25, Lewis' girlfriend accused him of dragging her across the floor and placing his hands around her neck, although Lewis rebuffed the account claiming he didn't touch her. He pleaded not guilty and this was expected to affect his draft stock. Lewis' draft projections varied from as high as the second or third round to as low as the sixth or seventh round, mainly due to his misdemeanor domestic violence charges. He was ranked the sixth cornerback in the draft by NFL analyst Mel Kiper Jr. and the tenth best cornerback prospect in the draft by NFLDraftScout.com. 2017 Jourdan Lewis covers Josh Doctson in a game against the Washington Redskins Lewis was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (92nd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the 14th cornerback selected in 2017. On June 28, the Dallas Cowboys signed Lewis to a four-year, $3.24 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $753,428. He was expected to compete with Orlando Scandrick, Chidobe Awuzie, Anthony Brown, and Nolan Carroll for a job as the starting cornerback, but suffered a hamstring injury during his first training camp practice and missed all of the preseason. On September 17, Lewis made his professional regular season debut against the Denver Broncos after being a healthy scratch for their season-opener. He went into the game after Carroll suffered a concussion and he recorded six solo tackles and intercepted the first pass of his career off of Broncos' quarterback Trevor Siemian in a 42‚Äì17 loss. The next week, he earned his first career start in place of Carroll and recorded six solo tackles and deflected a pass in a 28‚Äì17 win at the Arizona Cardinals. He suffers a hamstring injury during the game and was questionable going into the following week. During a Week 5 matchup against the Green Bay Packers, he made his second career start and collected seven combined tackles and a season-high three pass deflections in the Cowboys' 35-31 loss. Lewis gave up an 11-yard game-winning touchdown with 11 seconds left in the game to Davante Adams on a back shoulder fade thrown by Aaron Rodgers. Lewis was criticized by FS1 analyst Skip Bayless who attributed the touchdown to the height difference between Adams (6'2\\") and Lewis (5'10\\"). On October 8, the Cowboys released Carroll, making Lewis the starting right cornerback due to his performances. 2018 Lewis finished the 2018 season with 12 combined tackles, one interception, one pass defensed, and two fumble recoveries in 15 games. 2019 In week 6 against the New York Jets, Lewis recorded an interception off Sam Darnold in the 24‚Äì22 loss. In week 9 against the New York Giants, Lewis recovered a fumble forced by teammate Dorance Armstrong on Daniel Jones and returned it for a 63 yard touchdown in the 37‚Äì18 win. In week 14 against the Chicago Bears on Thursday Night Football, Lewis recorded a toe tapping interception off a pass thrown by Mitch Trubisky at the one yard line during the 31‚Äì24 loss. Personal life On March 15, 2017, Lewis' girlfriend claimed he had dragged her across the floor and put his hands around her neck to police. His girlfriend of three years had called police after she said an incident had taken place at their apartment. Two officers arrived and she told them the altercation began after an argument about him leaving the lights on and about their bills. She then claimed he threw a pillow at her and went into her closet. When she went to check to see if he was damaging her property, she somehow ended up on the ground and accused Lewis of dragging her across the floor. He supposedly then held her down by her neck for about three seconds. He was not arrested at the time. Lewis denied the claims and pleaded not guilty to a charge of misdemeanor charge of domestic violence the following day. On July 25, 2017, Lewis was found not guilty of all charges. During his tenure with the Wolverines became close friends with Tyler and Tucker Vasher. Tyler and Tucker both are diagnosed with Brittle Bone disease.

She works with Davey Higgins, a Detective Sergeant in the South Dart police; they were childhood sweethearts until he broke her heart. They investigate any sudden, violent or unexplained deaths in the South Hams district of South Devon.

The series would have self- contained stories with drama and humour; a formula successfully used in Father Brown from the same production team. The characters, Jane and Davey, were based on Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey in Adam's Rib with the unresolved sexual tension between them. Abbott wrote the Davey character with Matt Bardock in mind. She created four other characters to complete the cast. According to the BBC, the series is not based on, or inspired by, M R Hall's best-selling books including The Coroner. Hall stated he was \\"unhappy\\" about the \\"enormous similarities\\", but the BBC say any resemblance with his booksalso about an unusually pro-active, Land Rover driving, forty-something female solicitor who after a failed relationship returns to the West Country to take up the post of coronerare purely coincidental. The production office was located at Dartington where some interior scenes were filmed. Filming began in mid-April 2015 for 15 weeks. The episodes were divided into blocks of two with the same director, assistant director, and director of photography. Locations included Hope Cove, Dartmouth, Torquay, and Broadsands Beach, Paignton. The Mansion, now a community building, in Totnes was used as the Coroners Court. A brass plate was attached to the brickwork. The exterior and interior of Oldway Mansion is used as Lighthaven's town hall. The Old Customs House in Bayard's Cove, Dartmouth is the location of the Coroners office.

Reception The novel divided opinion: * Hermione Lee writing in The Guardian praises the novel as having 'a brilliantly slow, precise, careful structure, covering \\"every hour, every minute, every detail\\" of its case with as much control as it lays out its geography and deals with its parts of speech. Within this tight little map, the story it has to tell is wildly extreme, sensational and romantic.'Someone to watch over you, The Guardian, 08 Mar 2003] Retrieved 2015-11-11. * James Wood in the London Review of Books is also impressed: \\"The Light of Day is as close to seeming spoken as any novel I have read. It dares the ordinariness of flat, repetitious, unliterate narration... Swift‚Äôs dare is worth the risks, however. The book‚Äôs pleasures, slowly coddled, take time to mature, but in the process they teach you the art of reading slowly and carefully, of maturing with the story... Out of this apparently limited material and apparently limited style, Swift coaxes a novel of solemn depths.\\" * Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times is more critical, however: \\"The book is meticulously crafted, deftly moving back and forth in time to build suspense, but there is something lugubrious and solipsistic about its delivery. Mr. Swift puts us in the head of his narrator -- a downtrodden British private eye and disgraced former cop named George Webb -- for the entire book, and it proves to be a highly claustrophobic place to be. Worse, he allows George to natter on at needless length about his hopes and doubts, turning what might have been a slender, elegant book into a puffy, self-important volume\\" and concludes in wishing the novel \\"were a good 40 pages shorter\\".A Lovesick Gumshoe Who Is Willing to Wait, The New York Times, May 2, 2003 Retrieved 2015-11-11. * Anthony Quinn also writing in The New York Times is also critical: \\"It is difficult to reconcile the fact of so much writerly achievement with the feeling that the novel is somewhat underpowered\\" and that the author \\"has become a master of word-paring, phrase-clipping and scene-whittling, and the austerity of his style feels like a perfect fit with the voice of his laconic detective. Yet in cleaving to this scrupulous technique, he has skimped on the more obvious satisfactions of excitement and suspense. The pages turn, but the pulse never quickens.\\"Nobody's Prefect, The New York Times, May 4 2003 Retrieved 2015-11-11.

They are considered to contain the highest-quality naturally reproducing trout populations in Pennsylvania. The first streams received their Class A Wild Trout Waters designations in 1983. There are now hundreds of such waters, comprising nearly of streams. Class A Wild Trout Waters receive certain legal protections. For instance, they are typically classified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection as High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries. Most Class A Wild Trout Waters are subject to standard statewide angling regulations by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The official definition of Class A Wild Trout Waters is \\"streams that support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long-term and rewarding sport fishery\\". These streams are considered to be the best angling streams in Pennsylvania and most of the state's 67 counties contain at least one. Class A Wild Trout Waters are virtually never stocked, although many were prior to receiving their designation. There are different total biomass criteria for different species and combinations of species, but for brook trout alone, the minimum is , and for brown trout alone, the minimum is . History The modern stream classification system of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, including Class A Wild Trout Waters, was developed with Operation Future, which marked a transition from recreation-based management to resource-based management, in 1983. Following statewide stream surveys in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission created a set of biomass standards for trout streams in the state. The first streams were designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters in 1983. At that time, 138 stream sections, totaling nearly of streams, were found to meet the criteria. As more streams were assessed, the number of Class A Wild Trout Waters grew rapidly. By 2005, there were 436 Class A Wild Trout Waters, totaling . By the end of 2008, there were 487 such stream sections, which together included of streams. By 2014, there were 510 Class A Wild Trout Waters, comprising of streams. In the 2010s, the fact that the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission was considering adding seven urban streams to its list of Class A Wild Trout Watersthus ending stocking therecaused some criticism by anglers who believed that this would impact the quality of fishing in heavily fished streams such as Monocacy Creek and Little Lehigh Creek. However, the criticism was not universal, with proponents pointing out that a redesignation would provide extra protection for the streams. The Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission eventually decided to classify them as Class A Wild Trout Waters, but continue stocking them in the spring to satisfy angler demand. According to Pennsylvania Outdoor News Person of the Year Bill Anderson, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission has become hesitant to classify streams as Class A Wild Trout Waters due to \\"'social' concerns\\". Description and distribution The official definition of Class A Wild Trout Waters is \\"streams that support a population of naturally produced trout of sufficient size and abundance to support a long- term and rewarding sport fishery\\". Class A Wild Trout Waters are the \\"best of the best\\" streams for trout fishing in Pennsylvania. They are distributed widely across the state. However, most are found in north-central and northeastern Pennsylvania, while very few are in the western third of the state. Some Class A Wild Trout Waters are located in The Poconos or the Lehigh Valley. As of 2009, 49 of the state's 67 counties contain at least one Class A Wild Trout stream. However, in that year, only nine counties contained at least of Class A Wild Trout Waters. Class A Wild Trout Waters are virtually never stocked with trout since they are managed solely for the propagation of wild trout. However, most current Class A Wild Trout streams were historically stocked with trout prior to the introduction of the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission's classification system. They may also be tributaries of streams that are stocked with trout. In 2014, there were 274 Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout, comprising of streams. There were 163 such stream segments for brown trout, making up a total of of streams, and 62 Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout, totaling . There were only 11 Class A Wild Trout Waters for rainbow trout, making up of streams. Criteria In order to be listed as Class A Wild Trout Waters, a stream must be surveyed by Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission biologists with \\"approved protocols\\" to determine that it meets the relevant standards. The official designation is carried out by the Board of Commissioners. The criteria for Class A Wild Trout Waters vary by species. For brook trout, a biomass of , including at least of brook trout less than long. Additionally, brook trout may not make up less than 75 percent of the total wild trout biomass. The requirements are the same for brown trout except that the minimum brown trout biomass is . For a stream to be Class A Wild Trout Waters for both brook trout and brown trout, the combined biomass of both species must be at least and the biomass of each species must include at least of trout less than long. Neither species may make up more than 75 percent of the total wild trout biomass. The criteria for rainbow trout are considerably simpler: the only requirement is that the biomass of wild rainbow trout less than long must be at least . There is only one stream in Pennsylvania that is Class A Wild Trout Waters for brook trout and rainbow trout: Roaring Run. There are several rankings with lower biomass requirements in the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission's classification system: Class B Wild Trout Waters, Class C Wild Trout Waters, Class D Wild Trout Waters, and Class E Wild Trout Waters. Legal significance The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection designates Class A Wild Trout Waters as High-Quality Coldwater Fisheries, provided that there has been an adequate period of public comment and participation. This provides such streams with extra legal protections under the federal Clean Water Act. Thus, any activity involving discharges into a Class A Wild Trout Stream is required to comply with more restrictive standards than for other streams. Some streams receive Exceptional Value status due to their classification as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Under Section 57.8a of the Pennsylvania Code, the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission is to manage trout populations in Class A Wild Trout Waters as renewable natural resources, and to conserve the populations for anglers. The Susquehanna River Basin Commission bases its water withdrawal policy in part on the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission's biomass classifications system. The habitat loss criteria for Class A Wild Trout Waters is 5 percent, except in cases of social or economic justification, in which case it is 7.5 percent. Class A Wild Trout Waters are subject to several angling regulations. The vast majority (92 percent) of such steams are managed with the statewide minimum length of and the maximum creel limit of five fish. Of the 40+ Class A Wild Trout Waters under special regulations, about half are managed with a Catch and Release regulation. Trophy Trout and Wild Brook Trout Enhancement regulations apply to the remainder. A total of 31 Class A Wild Trout Waters have been designated as Wilderness Trout Streams. Fishing in Class A Wild Trout Waters is permitted year-round, although the killing of fish is forbidden from Labor Day to the beginning of the following year's trout season.

It was designed by Anton Hettrich and built from 1888 to 1889. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Bundaberg School of Arts, circa 1894 The former School of Arts is a substantial masonry building in classical revival style and was constructed in 1888-1889 as the third school of arts building on this site. The Burnett area, in which Bundaberg lies, was first settled by Europeans in the 1840s and 1850s as a series of pastoral runs. In the late 1860s, as good agricultural land around Maryborough began to be scarce, agriculturalists and timbergetters became interested in land on the navigable Burnett River to the north. The foundation settlers of Bundaberg selected land in 1867-68 under the \\"Sugar and Coffee Regulations\\" stemming from the Crown Lands Alienation Act of the 1860s which aimed to promote agriculture and closer settlement. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed in 1869. Coastal traffic grew, and copper was first mined at Mount Perry in 1871, which enabled Bundaberg to develop as a port and supply centre, in spite of competition from Maryborough for this trade. Although the higher southern bank of the river was officially surveyed as the town site, both sides soon developed wharves and buildings and were initially linked by ferry, then by bridges in the 1870s. Sugar plantations were established in the surrounding area and were to become the basis for the city's wealth as the industry boomed from the 1880s to the 1920s. In 1871, 3 allotments in Section 20 at the corner of Bourbong and Barolin Streets were reserved for a School of Arts. At this time the population of Bundaberg was about 100. Shortly afterwards, the institution opened in a simple weatherboard structure with little pretension to style, but which had a reading room and a library composed largely of fiction books. It was also used as a venue for meetings and for church services. The first Mechanics' Institutes or Schools of Arts were established in Britain in the early 1800s and were intended to assist self-improvement and to promote moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, discussions and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no free public libraries and books were expensive, so that access to books by borrowing as subscribers provided an important service. The first School of Arts committee in Queensland was established in Brisbane in 1849 with the aim of \\"the advancement of the community in literary, philosophic and scientific subjects\\". As towns and districts became established, local committees were formed to set up schools of arts, which became one of the principal sources of adult education. The government recognised this by making land available, subsidising books and assisting with building costs. A new timber School of Arts building in Bundaberg was constructed on the same site in 1880. The library received a considerable boost from the donation of 3 cases of English classics, ordered from London at a cost of , by Thomas McIlwraith, later to become Premier of Queensland and a life member of the School of Arts. The Book Committee also purchased a further 1400 volumes for the new building, the foundation of a library of notable quality. Although the building was larger than the first, this was a decade when the modest timber buildings of the early settlement were being replaced with handsome masonry structures reflecting Bundaberg's prosperity. A larger and more prestigious building was needed for the School of Arts. Fortunately, the reserve had by now become very valuable real estate, being located at the corner of the intersection which held reserves for the post office, municipal chambers and bank. It was also much larger than required and in 1887 the Committee petitioned the Queensland Legislative Assembly to permit them to divide the land and sell part of it to finance a building in keeping with the town's current position and future needs. An Enabling Act was passed to allow this and the surplus land was sold for . The new building was designed by Anton Hettrich, a local architect who was born and trained in Germany. In 1884 he commenced practice in Bundaberg and immediately won a competition for the design of the Bundaberg Town Hall. After winning the competition for the design of the School of Arts in 1888 he went briefly into partnership with William Champ, a builder, in order to carry out this and several other large commissions. Hettrich became a long-standing member of the School of Arts Committee and taught drawing and German there. His practice was very successful and only his pupil, Frederic Herbert Faircloth, gained a similar dominance in local architectural work. By 1897 Hettrich had designed more than 300 buildings in the area. He moved away from Bundaberg in 1900 to supervise work on the Gympie Court House for the Department of Works and later moved to Brisbane. The successful tenderer for the work was a Mr Calvert and work commenced on 2 June 1888 with the old building being moved to the rear of the site to allow continuation of services. The Trustees took possession of the completed building on 16 April 1889 for a cost of . It had a library and rooms available for rental on the ground floor, with a committee room to the rear. On the upper level was a large reading room opening out on to the verandah, a natural history museum and chess rooms. G.H. Bennett, President of the School of Arts Committee, expressed their satisfaction in the \\"elegant and substantial edifice, so suitable in every way for the purpose for which it was designed\\". From 1889 the School of Arts offered technical classes in a variety of practical subjects including drawing, shorthand, bookkeeping, typing, dressmaking, millinery, chemistry, dairy work, manual training and carpentry. These were so successful that in 1898 a timber hall designed by Frederick Faircloth was built behind the School of Arts to accommodate them. This had a stage and piano and was hired out when not in use, thus expanding the activities of the institution, and was enlarged soon after it was built. However, in 1908 the Technical Education Act shifted responsibility for provision of such classes to the government, a factor in the demise of Schools of Arts generally. Membership of the School of Arts was by subscription and membership numbers were never large. Running the institute was largely a voluntary affair and those involved in the work included many prominent local people, a number of whom were mayors. A gallery was added to the library in the early 1900s, although membership dropped with competition from other activities. However, membership rose again in the 1920s necessitating an extension of the library and this may have been why the western verandah was enclosed at this time. Even during the Depression when the cessation of government subsidies to Schools of Arts spelt the end for many, the Bundaberg institution continued to do well. In 1928 the construction of the AMP building next door blocked light into the rooms on that side and the eastern verandah was removed, that on the west being removed a few years later. Alternatives for education and leisure activities and the Libraries Act of 1943, which provided for free lending libraries, all contributed to the gradual closure of Schools of Arts around the state. Bundaberg's museum collection was broken up after World War II, but the earnings from rentals and the excellent library helped the School of Arts to survive. In 1969, the Bundaberg and District Museum was formed and moved into the hall the following year. The School of Arts library remained the only lending library in Bundaberg until the 1970s, when the city council conducted a feasibility study with a view to establishing a free public library. The future of the building was uncertain at this time and members of the Bundaberg Historical Society led public support for retention of the building. In 1976 repair work was carried out by the City of Bundaberg with the aid of a National Estate grant. The hall was demolished and the museum moved into the School of Arts building. The land, building and assets were transferred by the Trustees of the School of Arts to the Bundaberg City Council on 1 January 1979. The library was transferred to the former Customs House and Commonwealth Bank in Quay Street in 1981. The Bundaberg Art Society then used the library room and other rooms in the School of Arts as an art gallery and offices. In 1988 the museum moved into a new building and in the late 1990s the art gallery also moved out. The building continues to serve the people of Bundaberg by being available for hire for cultural and community purposes.  Description  The former School of Arts is a substantial 2 storey rendered brick building in classical revival style and is located close the major intersection of the Bundaberg central business district. It is now bracketed by more modern buildings. The School of Arts is rectangular in plan and has a hipped roof clad in corrugated iron with cast iron cresting. It is concealed from the street by a parapet with Italianate balusters topped by cement urns. The most striking feature of the building is a 2-storey arcaded verandah along the street elevation which returns for 3 bays on each side. The arcades are constructed of rendered brick and consist on both levels of a central arch topped by a small triangular pediment and flanked by large arches. These are formed of pilasters with Corinthian capitals on masonry plinths supporting a semicircular arch with a cental key and edge mould. Cast-iron balustrading links the plinths. The panels between arch, cornice and pilaster are decorated with a wreath and ribbon design in render. Timber verandahs at each side of the building have recently been reconstructed according to their original form, and the walls behind them are of exposed brick. The brick at the rear of the building has been rendered. Double hung sash windows with round-headed fanlights echo the arcade at the front of the building, as do arches across the interior hallways. The interior of the building is intact and well detailed. The ground floor walls are plastered brick and there is a central hall from which the former library and offices are reached. The main staircase at the rear of the hall is semicircular in plan and has two niches and a window in the stairwell and a turned timber balustrade leading to a first floor landing. This is joined to the former reading room by a short hall which has smaller rooms to the left and right. The partition walls are of narrow tongue and groove vertical boarding and there are timber ceilings and cornices. The doors have fretted transoms with a lyre and acanthus design, a classical reference appropriate to centre dedicated to education and the arts.  Heritage listing  The former Bundaberg School of Arts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Bundaberg School of Arts is important as part of the network of Schools of Arts which sprang up in any town of consequence in Queensland during the 19th and early 20th centuries and were a measure of prosperity and progress. The scale and style of the building amply demonstrate the wealth and importance of Bundaberg as a sugar city at this period. Schools of Arts were community based and played a valuable role in the dissemination of information and the provision of facilities for lectures, meetings, games of skill and community events. They were an important stage in the development of adult education in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of a major regional School of Arts which provided a library, reading room, committee room and museum. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It is a well designed and imposing building, which by its form, scale and location near a major intersection, makes a major contribution to the townscape of Bundaberg. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has strong associations with the community of Bundaberg, as an educational and cultural facility and as a source of civic pride for well over a century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The building is one of the most important works of prolific local architect Anton Hettrich and also has associations with him as a long-standing member of the School of Arts committee and as a teacher of drawing and German at this institution.

It converts this direct-attached storage into shared block storage than runs over an IP-based network. PowerFlex can scale from three compute/storage nodes to over 1,000 nodes that can drive up to 240 million IOPS of performance. PowerFlex is bundled with Dell EMC commodity computing servers (officially called VxFlex Ready Nodes, PowerFlex appliance, and PowerFlex rack). PowerFlex can be deployed as storage only or as a converged infrastructure combining storage, computational and networking resources into a single block. Capacity and performance of all available resources are aggregated and made available to every participating PowerFlex server and application. Storage tiers can be created with media types and drive types that match the ideal performance or capacity characteristics to best suit the application needs.  History  ScaleIO was founded in 2011 by Boaz Palgi, Erez Webman, Lior Bahat, Eran Borovik, and Erez Ungar in Israel. The software was designed for high performance and large systems. The company was backed by venture capital firms including Greylock Partners and Norwest Venture Partners. A product was announced in November 2012. EMC Corporation bought ScaleIO in June 2013 for about $200 million, only about six months after the company emerged from stealth mode. EMC began promoting ScaleIO in 2014 and 2015, marketing it in competition with EMC‚Äôs own data storage arrays. Also in 2015, EMC introduced a model of its VCE (company) converged infrastructure hardware that supported ScaleIO storage. At its 2015 trade show, EMC announced that ScaleIO would be made freely available to developers for testing. By May, 2015, developers could download the ScaleIO software. In September 2015, EMC announced the availability of the previously software-only ScaleIO pre-bundled on EMC commodity hardware, called EMC ScaleIO Node. In May, 2017, Dell EMC announced ScaleIO.Next, featuring inline compression, thin provisioning and flash-based snapshots. The new release features enhanced snapshot tools and features and full support for VMware Virtual Volumes (VVols), as well as volume migration for deployments that want to take advantage of lower cost media for low-priority data. In March, 2018, ScaleIO was rebranded to VxFlex OS and continued to be the software defined storage for VxFlex Ready Nodes, VxFlex appliance and VxFlex integrated system (VxRack FLEX). In April, 2019, VxFlex OS 3.0 (ScaleIO 3.0) was released. In June, 2020, VxFlex OS was rebranded to PowerFlex and version 3.5 was released which included updates such as native asynchronous replication, HTML5 Web UI, secure snapshots and other core improvements.  Architecture  PowerFlex uses storage and compute resources of commodity hardware. It combines HDDs, SSDs, and PCIe flash cards to create a virtual pool of block storage with varying performance tiers. It features on-demand performance and storage scalability, as well as enterprise- grade data protection, multi-tenant capabilities, and add-on enterprise features such as QoS, thin provisioning and snapshots. PowerFlex operates on multiple hardware platforms and supports physical and/or virtual application servers. PowerFlex works by installing software components on application hosts. Application hosts contribute internal disks and any other direct attached storage resources to the PowerFlex cluster by installing the SDS software. Hosts can then be presented volumes from the PowerFlex cluster by leveraging the SDC software. These components can run alongside other applications on any server (physical, virtual, or cloud) using any type of storage media (disk drives, flash drives, PCIe flash cards, or cloud storage). The PowerFlex architecture is built on two components: a data client and a data server. The Storage Data Client (SDC) is a lightweight device driver situated in each host whose application or file system requires access to the PowerFlex virtual SAN block devices. The SDC exposes block devices representing the PowerFlex volumes that are currently mapped to that host. The SDCs maintain a small in-memory map, being able to maintain mapping of petabytes of data with just megabytes of RAM. The inter-node protocol used by SDCs is simpler than iSCSI and uses fewer network resources. The Storage Data Server (SDS) is situated in each host and contributes local storage to the central PowerFlex virtual SAN. Each node is part of a loosely coupled cluster. Performance is expected to increase as servers and storage devices are added to the cluster. Additional storage and compute resources (i.e., additional servers and drives) can be added modularly. Every server in the PowerFlex cluster is used in the processing of I/O operations, making all I/O and throughput accessible to any application within the cluster. Any needed rebuilds and rebalances are processed in the background. Workloads are evenly shared with a parallel I/O architecture. PowerFlex can be deployed in either a \\"two-layer\\" multi-server cluster in which the application and storage are installed in separate servers, or as \\"hyper-converged\\" option where the application and storage are installed on the same servers in the PowerFlex cluster, creating a low-footprint, low-cost scalable single-layer architecture. Capacity and performance of all available resources are aggregated and made available to every participating PowerFlex server and application. Storage tiers can be created with media types and drive types that match the ideal performance or capacity characteristics to best suit the application needs. Storage and compute resources can be added to or removed from the PowerFlex cluster as needed, with no downtime and minimal impact to application performance. The self-healing, auto-balancing capability of the PowerFlex cluster ensures that data is automatically rebuilt and rebalanced across resources when components are added, removed, or failed. Because every server and local storage device in the cluster is used in parallel to process I/O operations and protect data, system performance scales linearly as additional servers and storage devices are added to the configuration. PowerFlex software takes each data chunk to be written and spreads it across many nodes, mirroring it as well. This makes data rebuilds from disk loss very fast as several nodes contribute their own smaller, faster and parallel rebuild efforts to the whole. PowerFlex supports VMware, Hyper-V, Xen and KVM hypervisors. It also supports OpenStack, Windows, Red Hat, SLES, CentOS, and CoreOS (docker).

She was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in botany from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Education Elliott was born in Berlin, Wisconsin. She got her undergraduate degree in zoology at Stanford University in 1907. For a few years afterwards she taught biology at the state normal school in Spearfish and took summer courses at the University of Chicago. She returned to Stanford for master's work in plant physiology, receiving her A.M. in 1913. She was offered an appointment as assistant in the botany department but refused for reasons having to do with her family and instead returned to Wisconsin. In Wisconsin, she worked for two years (1914‚Äì16) as an instructor at South Dakota State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts. She left to pursue graduate work in plant pathology, first as a research assistant at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and then as a Ph.D. student at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, where she was supported by a Boston Alumne Fellowship. In 1918, she became the first woman to complete the doctoral program in botany at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Her thesis work focused on halo blight, a disease affecting oats. Career Elliott was recruited by the bacteriologist Erwin Frink Smith to work in the Bureau of Plant Industry at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). There she continued her research as a phytobacteriologist or specialist in the organisms harmful to plants, publishing numerous papers in her field. Among her scientifically notable papers is one establishing the role of the flea beetle as a vector in the development of the disease known as Stewart's Wilt in corn (maize). This research led to a method for forecasting how bad the disease would be in any given year based on temperature indexes that reflected how successfully the beetles had survived the preceding winter. Her work also led to the description of several new species. Elliott wrote a widely used book, Manual of Bacterial Plant Pathogens, first published in 1930, reissued with revisions in 1951, and still being drawn on by researchers today. In 1942, she served as the president of the Botanical Society of Washington. Elliott died in 1974.

In Summer 1951, as the war bogged down into mutual defensive ground warfare characterized by trench warfare, United Nations close air support found fewer and poorer targets for its fighter-bombers. The USAF turned to interdiction of Korean lines of communication in an effort to cut the communist supply lines. Operation Strangle's 87,552 interdiction sorties were credited with destroying 276 locomotives, 3,820 railroad cars, and 19,000 rail cuts. They also destroyed 34,211 other vehicles. However, by December 1951, the communists repaired rail cuts in less than six hours, bridges in two to four days, and other bomb damage accordingly quickly. By May 1952, it was apparent that the communist supply efforts had actually increased support to their front-line troops despite the air attacks. By June, half of communist antiaircraft guns--132 cannons and 708 automatic weapons--were posted along North Korea's railroads.Futrell, pp. 471 - 474. Background After July 1951, UN, North Korean and Chinese forces made advancements toward the goal of an armistice agreement. Throughout the negotiations, USAF (United States Air Force) aerial bombing continued until 27 July 1953. This was until the armistice negotiations came to a halt over POWs (prisoners of war). The USAF created a strategy called an ‚Äúair pressure strategy‚Äù to put political pressure on the North Korean politicians, this new strategy sought pass existing political and military limitations on air power. It also used air power as a form of direct political pressure. Colonels Richard Randolph and Ben Mayo oversaw planning for the air pressure strategy, selecting proper targets for air operations. The two kept in mind the scarce targets in North Korea, they suggested that the solution to the problem would be to attack the least maneuverable target. On 26 June 1952, the FEAF Target Committee proposed that FEAF‚Äôs combat operations policy should be rewritten sufficiently to follow the Fifth Air Force and FEAF Bomcom to maintain ‚Äúair pressure‚Äù through destructive operations rather than pressing with the old policy. General Otto P. Weyland, commanding general of the FEAF, approved the changes on 29 June 1952. As the air pressure strategy came out as the USAF‚Äôs new military plan, North Korean towns and villages were painted as major targets to be destroyed by the bombers. FEAF‚Äôs Fifth Air Force selected thirty-five villages as targets for destruction by B-26 light bombers. The numbers eventually grew to seventy- eight villages. During late August 1951, U.N. forces started \\"Operation Strangle\\"‚Äîa sustained interdiction attack on the enemy's supply and communications. The North Koreans countered the campaign by moving guns and crews towards the front-line. By the time the movement was complete, North Koreans moved flak guns and positioned them to spread throughout the North Korean rail lines. They also implemented a strategy of having lethal concentrations around important targets. This caused the U.N. heavy casualties and losses. However, despite of the high loss, Operation Strangle has the U.N. to destroy 900 anti-aircraft gun positions and damage 443 positions. North Koreans had large numbers of radar-directed AA. guns, 88-or 85-mm. (including long-range 120s or 155s). They also had a large quantity of smaller guns which include 37-mm/20-mm cannons and 12.7-mm heavy machine guns. Additionally, they also had radar-directed searchlights, which can hold sight of night-flying U.N. planes. The U.N. used electronic jamming against the communist radar on the radar-directed AA guns, but most U.N. planes lost by the smaller guns. Operation Strangle has led U.N. forces to hitting targets, knocking out a range of weapons including guns and strategic positions.Deadly Flak. (1952). Time, 59(6), 40.

His father, Dr. Dov Jarden, was a mathematician, writer and linguist, who transmitted him his love to mathematics. In 1970 he received his Ph.D in Mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, with Hillel Furstenberg as his thesis advisor. He accomplished his post doctorate during the years 1971-1973 at the Institut of Mathematics, Heidelberg University, with Peter Roquette as his mentor, and habilitated there in 1972. During these years in Heidelberg, he initiated an intense and long term cooperation with German mathematicians, especially with Peter Roquette, Wulf-Dieter Geyer, Gerhard Frey, and Juergen Ritter. His achievements in mathematics, as well as the foundation of this fruitful cooperation with German mathematicians, earned him the L. Meithner-A.v.Humboldt Prize by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2001. In 1974, Moshe Jarden returned to Israel, and joined the School of Mathematics of Tel Aviv University. He became a full professor in 1982, and the incumbent of the Cissie and Aaron Beare chair in Algebra and Number Theory in 1998. One of his great achievements is the publication of the book \\"Field Arithmetic\\" in the series Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete of Springer, which earned him the Landau Prize. Work The main contribution of Moshe Jarden in algebra, and in mathematics in general, is his research on families of large algebraic extensions of Hilbertian fields (in particular global fields), parametrized by the automorphisms of the absolute Galois group of the base field. Notable results in this domain are the zero theorem, the transfer theorem, the free generators theorem, the Frey-Jarden theorem about the rank of algebraic varieties over large algebraic fields, Geyer-Jarden theorem about torsion points on elliptic curves over large algebraic fields, and the strong approximation theorem over such fields. The remarkable development of Galois theory over a class of large fields, called ample fields,These fields, previously called large fields by Florian Pop, were so named by M. Jarden because the term large fields was already used in another context. is described in the second book of Jarden: Algebraic Patching. Field arithmetic In 1979, Moshe Jarden came to Irvine and met Michael Fried. This was during this visit that Fried suggested to write a joint book on the topics they had worked about so far, and proposed the name \\"Field arithmetic\\". This book, where Diophantine fields are explored through their absolute Galois groups, was influential in the domain of field theory. Owing to this work, the intense activity of Moshe Jarden, and his influence on his colleagues, \\"Field Arithmetic\\" has become a recognized name of a branch of algebra, with its own classification number (12E30 Field Arithmetic). The impact of this book can also be measured by the number of open problems presented in the first and second editions (twenty two), which were mostly solved between the publication of the first and third editions. In 1987, Moshe Jarden won the Landau Prize for the publication of \\"Field Arithmetic\\". Some years after the release of the first edition, it was realized that the term \\"field arithmetic\\" had already been coined by the mathematician Paulo Ribenboim somewhat earlier, who had published a book in French named \\"L'Arithm√©tique des Corps\\". Awards and honors He was awarded the Landau prize for the book \\"Field Arithmetic\\" in 1987, and the L. Meithner-A.v.Humboldt Prize in 2001 for his achievements in mathematics.

Hindori served in Suriname's parliament. In the run-up to independence for Suriname in 1975, he was the second in command of the Progressive Reform Party, led by Jagernath Lachmon. That party was the main opponent of immediate independence from the Netherlands. Following a trip to the Netherlands, Hindori switched his position, favoring immediate independence, and broke with the Progressive Reform Party. He then backed the independence policies of Prime Minister Henck Arron. After initially opposing independence, his decision to switch and support the Suriname independence movement gave the movement enough votes to secure independence from the Netherlands. His change of position has been described in terms ranging from \\"brave, conscientious and nationalistic, to opportunistic or even 'bribed'\\". He held the position of Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture. Hindori was born into a Brahmin family in Paramaribo.

The planet is considered uninhabitable but cool enough to possess an atmosphere. Gliese 1132 b was discovered by the MEarth-South array in Chile. It has been called \\"one of the most important planets ever discovered beyond the Solar System\\": Due to its relative proximity to Earth, telescopes should be able to determine the composition of its atmosphere, the speed of its winds and the color of its sunsets. This is due in part to the small diameter of its parent star (21% that of the Sun), which increases the effect on the star's light of its transits. The planet's diameter is approximately 20% larger than that of the Earth and its mass is estimated at 1.6 times that of Earth, implying that it has an Earth-like rocky composition. Gliese 1132 b orbits its star every 1.6 days at a distance of 1.4 million miles (2.24 million kilometres). The planet receives 19 times more stellar radiation than Earth. The temperature of the top of its atmosphere is estimated at . The planet is estimated to be hotter than Venus, as higher temperatures may prevail near the surface. (cf. Atmosphere of Venus, Colonization of Venus) It is possible that one side of the planet is cooler, because it is presumed to be tidally locked due to its proximity to its star; however, under most circumstances where an atmosphere is thick, it would be able to transfer heat to the far side. In April 2017, a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere was claimed to have been detected around Gliese 1132 b. However, subsequent, more precise work ruled out the previous claim.

Jain festivals are either related to life events of Tirthankara or they are performed with intention of purification of soul. Festivals There are many religious festivals in Jainism. Some of them are associated with five auspicious life events of Tirthankara known as Panch Kalyanaka. Jains celebrate many annual festivals. Many of the major festivals in Jainism fall in and around the chaomasa (Sanskrit: chaturmasa) period of the calendar. It is the four-month monsoon period when the Jain ascetics are mandated to remain in residence at one place in the Jain tradition, rather than be traveling or going around Indian villages and towns and never staying in one place for more than a month. The comasu period allows the four orders of the Jain community to be together and participate in the festive remembrances. Paryushana Das Lakshana (Paryusana) celebrations, Jain Center of America, New York City. Paryushana Parva is one of the most important festival for Jains. Paryusana is formed by two words meaning 'a year' and 'a coming back'. This festival comes in the months of Shravana and Bhadra (August or September). Svetambara Jains celebrate it for eight-days while Digambara Jains celebrate it for ten days. It is also known as Das Lakshana Parva. It is a festival of repentance and forgiveness. Many Jains fast and carry out different religious activities. Jain monks stop walking during chaturmas and reside at one place where they lecture on various religious subjects during paryushana. This festival is believed to remove accumulated karma of the previous year and develop control over new accumulating new karma, by following Jain austerities and other rituals. There are regular rituals at the Jain temples. Discourses of Kalpa Sutra are given by monks. Kalpa Sutra describes life of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras. On the third day, procession of Kalpa Sutra is carried out. On the fifth day, auspicious dreams of Trishala, mother of Mahavira are demonstrated and after that birth of Mahavira is celebrated. The tenth day of festival is called Anant Chaurdsashi. Anant Chaturdashi is the day when Lord Vasupujya attained moksha (nirvan). Usually, a procession is taken out by Jains on this day. Kshamavani is generally observed a day after Anant Chaturdashi by digambaras, while the shwetambaras observe it after the 8th ie the last day of their paryushan.(last day is called samvatsari) On Kshamavani, Jains ask for forgiveness from everybody for any acts during the previous year which may have hurt them.  Janma kalayanak Om Hrim Siddhi Chakra used by Jains in dravya puja Mahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jain calendar month of Chaitra, probably 599 BCE. It falls in March or April. This festival marks the birth of lord Mahavira (last, 24th tirtankara). Procession is carried out and lectures on the message of Mahavira are presented. The idols of Mahavira are ceremonially bathed and rocked in a cradle. Events related to birth are also recited from sacred texts by monks. Ashtanhika Parv This is a Jain festival celebrated for eight days three times a year in the months of Kartik, Falgun and Ashdah. It is celebrated from eighth day of Shukla Paksh (Waxing moon Cycle) till Purnima/Guru Purnima every year. Nandishwar Ashtanika The Nandishwara island is surrounded three mountain ranges called the Anjana mountain, the Dadhimukha mountain, and the Ratikara mountain. Since human beings are unable to go to Nandishwar dweep they worship in temples. Jains Perform Special Pooja, SiddhChakra Vidhan, Nandishwar Vidhan and Mandal Vidhan. The word Ashta meaning eight and Aanika meaning every day. When the festival falls in the months of Aashad and Phalguna, then the ritual is known as Nandishwar Ashtahnika. This ritual helps to gain greater spiritual insight, and wisdom. The observance of this ritual brings wish fulfilment for the devotees. Diwali Diwali is one of the most important festival in India. Mahavir attained nirvana followed by moksha on this day in 527 BCE. It falls on the last day of Ashvina month of Jain calendar. It is also the last day of Indian calendar. It comes during October or November. It is believed that the eighteen kings of northern India, followers of Mahavira, decided to light lamps (known as dipa) symbolizing knowledge of Mahavira. So it is known as Deepavali or Diwali. Jains are forbidden to burst crackers. On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples all across the world. Gautam Gandhar Swami, the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira achieved omniscience (Kevala Gyan) later the same day. New Year After celebrating Diwali at the end of Ashwina, Jains celebrate new year on the first day of the following month of Kartika. Ritual of Snatra Puja is performed at the temple. Mahavira's chief disciple Gautama Swami attained keval gyan on this day. Gyana Panchami The fifth day of Kartika is known as Gyana Panchami. It is considered knowledge day. On this day holy scriptures are displayed and worshipped. Pausha Dashmi It is celebrated on 10th day of dark half of Pausha (Pushya) month of Jain calendar(December/January). It marks Janma Kalyanaka (Birth) of 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanath. Three days fast known as Attham is observed by many Jains. Gommateshvara Bahubali, Mahamastakabhisheka festival, 2006 Maun agiyaras  Maun Agiyaras or Ekadashi marks Kalyanaka of many Tirthankaras. It is celebrated on 11th day of Magshar month of Jain calendar(October/November). On this day, complete silence is observed and fasting is kept. Meditation is also performed. Navapad Oli The nine-day Oli is a period of semi-fasting. During these period Jains take only one meal a day of food without ghee etc., oils, or any kind of spices. It comes twice a year during March/April and September/October. Mahamastakabhisheka Mahamastakabhisheka is a festival held once every twelve years in the town of Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. It is held in veneration of an immense 18 meter high statue of Bahubali. The last anointing took place in February 2018, and the next ceremony will occur in 2030. Roth Teej Roth Teej is celebrated on Bhadrapada Shukla Tritiya. On Roth Teej, the Jains are supposed to eat only one type of grain food, roth, once during the day. The festival is a reminder that material wealth is not important, only relinquishment leads to true happiness. Varshi Tapa or Akshay Tritiya Tapa King Shreyansa giving ' to Rishabha One Anna coin issued by the British Indian Government in the year 1818 on the occasion of Jain festival of Akshay Tritiya depicting Tirthankar Lord Rishabhdev accepted sugarcane juice from Shreyanskumar and completing his austerity of one year fast (Varshi Tapa) Akshaya Tritiya is celebrated to commemorate Lord Adinath's ending of one-year fast by consuming sugarcane juice poured into his cupped hands. The first Jain Tirthankara Lord Rishabhdev completed of an austerity on 3rd day of the bright fortnight of Vaishakh month of Jain calendar after fasting for 13 months and 13 days continuously. People who performed austerity known as Varshi tapa regarding these event complete the austerity on this day by taking sugar-cane juice.

Kardian lectures, teaches, and consults internationally. Between his personal engagements and his self-defense/safety certification organization, Defend University, Kardian trains thousands of people each year on safety and self-defense, as well as strategies and tactics uniquely tailored to women's safety.  Biography  Kardian was born on October 7, 1957 in White Plains, New York. When he was 17, he was visiting his girlfriend's family in Old Saybrook, CT when he witnessed a woman jump up from her beach chair and begin screaming and waving her arms frantically. A large mound of sand had collapsed onto and buried her 8-year-old nephew. Kardian rushed over and dug the child out, who was not breathing. Others gathered around, but in a crowd of 20 people, none knew CPR. Kardian didn't either, but he successfully performed the resuscitation from a memory of a pamphlet that he had read, saving the child's life. Kardian would later credit this event as the springboard for his pursuit of training people in public safety practices, promoting changes to social safety dogmas, and redefining personal safety. Kardian was appointed to the Westchester County Victims Assistance advisory board from 2008 to 2012, and currently lives in Westchester County, New York with his wife.  Career = Certifications  Kardian is a certified New York State and FBI defensive tactics instructor and served as the Chief Criminal Investigator with the New York Department of Instigations. He holds the rank of 3rd degree Black Belt in Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, a martial art which also honors Kardian with the title of professor. Kardian also has a black belt in Kyokushin Karate, is a Muay Thai Kick Boxing coach, and serves as Associate Instructor under world shoot fighting world champion and MMA coach Erik Paulson. He is a state-certified general defensive topics instructor, including T.A.S.E.R., chemical weapons, pepper spray, use of force, baton, and radar/laser certifications. Kardian worked at the Westchester County Police Academy as a senior Defensive Tactics Instructor from 1995 to 2007, teaching defensive tactics, interactive skills, and how to become an effective force supervisor, among other subjects.  Law Enforcement and Private Training  Kardian began training police officers on Defensive Tactics in 1980 when he was recruited by an instructor at the Conn Municipal Police Academy to train part-time Police Officers. Kardian has taught international, federal, state, county and local law enforcement officers across the United States and in Europe, where he has taught Jiu-Jitsu, certified instructors for women's self- defense, and set up law enforcement training for police officers in Ireland and England. His students have included members of the FBI, DEA, US Treasury Department, NY State Police, Army Rangers, Navy Seals, the DELTA force, London's Metropolitan Police, Ireland's Garda Siochana, and the Israeli Security Agency under the Prime Minister's Office (Shin Bet). He was invited by Lt. Colonel in the NYSP to lecture and teach the Executive Division of the Governors office for the State of New York, training the women in the executive division of the Governors office in personal safety and defense.  Defend University  Kardian started Defend University in Phoenix, AZ in the early 1990s with his partner, Brad Parker. Parker was approached by a group of female survivors of assault (including sexual assault, domestic violence, and kidnapping) requesting self-defense training. He taught them martial arts techniques, but found the techniques were not effectively deployed by the women, so he began teaching them how to fight by tailoring techniques to the unique strengths of their gender against the weaknesses of male attackers, while utilizing Jiu-jutsu concepts of the ground as their safety position. Kardian joined soon after and Defend University was founded.  Women's Self Defense Institute  The Women's Self Defense Institute was developed under Defend University as a research and development group to provide research and training on cutting edge tactics and strategies for women's safety and self- defense, and also law enforcement safety and self-defense. To date, these programs have certified thousands of instructors, students and police officers in tactics, techniques and strategies that have and will keep them safe.  Less Than Lethal  Under Defend University, Kardian is the founder of the Less Than Lethal program, which teaches tactics and ground control for law enforcement with the stated goal of reducing injuries to both suspects and police officers during physical encounters. The program began in New York state, where Kardian worked with the Office of Public Safety, Department of Criminal Justice, evaluating and submitting changes in the way recruits and Defensive Tactics Instructors across the State of New York are trained and taught.  Campuspeak  From 2008 to 2012, Kardian lectured throughout United States on campus and women's safety at colleges and universities for CAMPUSPEAK. CAMPUSPEAK was founded in 1999 as an agency representing college speakers and has become the leading provider of professional speakers.  Media  Kardian has served as a women's safety, security and law enforcement consultant for Inside Edition, Fox & Friends, Fox News (America's News Room), Fox News (Real Story) CNN, HLN, Nancy Grace, Dr. Drew, Jane Velez-Mitchell, HLN Morning Express, News Now, The Morning Show, CBS, NBC, ABC, The Meredith Vieira Show, Men's Journal, the New York Times, Cosmopolitan Magazine, Women's Day, All About You Magazine, Best Life Magazine, Real Simple Magazine, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, America Survival Guide, Details Magazine, Omega Life Systems Magazine, AARP Magazine and Sports Illustrated.. Through his media work Kardian has reached hundreds of thousands of women with his media safety segments including anti abduction, campus safety, home safety, safety devises for women, stalking, holiday safety, travel safety, car safety, nightclub safety, dating safety, domestic safety and more. In 2003, 2004, and 2012, Kardian worked alongside investigative media teams with NBC and Inside Edition and lured 21 out of 21 women into compromising situations that, if he was real predator, would have compromised their safety, effectively using media to empower women with information and tactics that will help them avoid abduction, campus safety, and date rape drugs awareness.

Leopards cross between China, Russia and North Korea across the Tumen River despite a high and long wire fence marking the international boundary. *Indochinese leopard (P. p. delacouri) in Yunnan Province of southern China, where the Pearl River is thought to form a barrier to leopard populations farther north. *Indian leopard (P. p. fusca) in southern Tibet, where leopards have been recorded in Qomolangma National Nature Preserve.  Taxonomic history  Several leopard zoological specimens from South and East Asia were described between the late 18th and early 20th centuries: *Felis fusca was the scientific name used by Friedrich Albrecht Anton Meyer in 1794 who described a black leopard from India. This type specimen was on display at the Tower of London. *Felis orientalis proposed by Hermann Schlegel in 1857 was a leopard skin from Korea. *Leopardus japonensis proposed by John Edward Gray in 1862 was a leopard skin received by the British Museum. *Leopardus chinensis described by Gray in 1867 was a leopard skin from the environs of Peking. *Felis pardus sinensis described by Emil Brass in 1911 was a leopard skin from southern China. Fossil leopard teeth excavated in southern China dating to the Middle Pleistocene were assessed as similar to those of P. p. sinensis. *Panthera pardus delacouri by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1930 was a leopard skin from Annam. Leopards in southern China were subsumed to P. p. delacouri following phylogeographic analysis in 1996. In 2001, results of a genetic analysis indicated that P. p. delacouri and P. p. japonensis are contiguous, and that the latter is contiguous with P. p. orientalis.

In 2017, the Cat Classification Taskforce of the Cat Specialist Group subsumed P. p. japonensis to P. p. orientalis, thereby recognising leopards in northern China as belonging to P. p. orientalis, while accepting the possibility of leopards in southern China as belonging to P. p. delacouri. Distribution Camera- trap surveys conducted between 2002 and 2009 in 11 nature reserves in southern China recorded leopards only in Changqing National Nature Reserve in the Qinling Mountains, but neither in Sichuan's Wolong Nature Reserve nor in other protected areas in Sichuan. Contemporary records of leopards exist from protected areas in the provinces Hebei, Henan and Shanxi and Ningxia. No leopard was recorded during surveys in Gansu province. Whether leopards still occur in Qinghai province is uncertain. It has probably been extirpated in Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces. It is listed as nationally Critically Endangered, but receives little attention from Chinese wildlife biologists and conservationists. Ecology Contemporary ecological data on habitat use and requirements of leopards in China does not exist. Results of surveys in Wolong Nature Reserve in the 1980s indicate that leopards might have attacked giant pandas. Attacks on humans have also been reported, though they are rare.

Early years Charles L√©on Claude Dani√©lou came from a prosperous Breton family with the strong tradition of political activity. His great-grandfather, Jean-Marie Dani√©lou (1764‚Äì1814), was mayor of Locronan under Napoleon. His grandfather, Jean-Pierre Dani√©lou (1798‚Äì1864), was a notary in Locronan and then Douarnenez, where he was mayor during the French Second Republic from April 1848 to January 1949. His father, Eug√®ne- Lucien-Napol√©on Dani√©lou (1834‚Äì1897) was a wealthy wine merchant and one of the leading businessmen in Douarnenez, where he was several times mayor between 1855 and 1896. Eug√®ne Dani√©lou was a militant Republican and atheist, and would not marry in church or allow his children to be baptized. Charles L√©on Claude Dani√©lou was born on 13 July 1878 in Douarnenez, Finist√®re. His parents were unmarried. Tradition says that he was baptized by a washerwoman. Charles attended the local school with the sons of fishermen, then attended the lyc√©e in Brest for his secondary education. He studied to enter the Navy, but failed the medical examination due to his poor eyesight. He began writing poetry, and in 1897 sent a copy of his first collection of poems to Fran√ßois Copp√©e, who invited him to come to Paris. Dani√©lou moved to Paris in 1897 and was drawn into the circle of Copp√©e and Jos√©-Maria de Heredia. He was converted to Christianity and baptized in 1897. He met literary and political figures such as Henri de R√©gnier, Pierre Lou√øs, Gabriel Hanotaux, Louis Barthou, Georges Leygues, √âmile Zola and Sarah Bernhardt. Dani√©lou was present at the last meeting between Zola and Copp√©e during the Dreyfus affair. Zola had decided to publish his J'Accuse‚Ä¶!, in which he proclaimed that Dreyfus was innocent, despite pleas by Copp√©e. Dani√©lou sided with Copp√©e and helped found the anti-Dreyfus Ligue de la patrie fran√ßaise in December 1898. Dani√©lou started to contribute to the Parisian journals such as Les Annales de la Vie fran√ßaise, l'Homme libre, Le Petit Journal, Paris-Midi, l'Eclair and Le Soleil. He published several collections of verse, and published two adventure novels in the Echo de Paris. Dani√©lou married Madeleine Clamorgan on 27 July 1904. She was daughter of General Clamorgan, and an agr√©g√©e in Literature. She later wrote several books on education and founded various free educational institutions for women. While Charles Dani√©lou became known for his anti- clericalism, his wife was always a devout Catholic. She founded the Order of Sainte-Marie. After their marriage the couple settled in Locronan, where Charles Dani√©lou was elected as a municipal councilor in 1908, running as an Independent Republican. He became mayor in 1912, and retained that position until 1944. He worked to preserve the Renaissance architecture of the small town, and in 1934 founded a museum of local art. There were six children from the marriage including Jean Dani√©lou, who became a Catholic cardinal and Catherine, wife of Georges Izard. Their son Louis Dani√©lou joined the navy and died in 1942 during World War II. Alain Dani√©lou became a well-known historian. National politics Dani√©lou ran for election to the legislature for the first district of Ch√¢teaulin, Finist√®re, in April‚ÄìMay 1910, and won on the second round. At first he sat with the Liberal Action group, but in 1911 joined the Progressive Republicans. He introduced a bill to ensure that sailors had religious freedom and another to provide subsidies for repairing school buildings. He ran for reelection in April‚ÄìMay 1914, but was defeated. He ran again in the general elections on 16 November 1919 as a Radical on the Republican Concentration list, and was successful. He joined the group of Left Republicans. On 19 April 1921 the prime minister Aristide Briand appointed him \\"commissioner for French expansion abroad.\\" Dani√©lou was reelected on 11 May 1924 on the Republican list. He joined the Radical Left group, where he remained for the rest of his career. He was president of this group more than once. He was under-secretary of state for Ports, Merchant Marine and Fishery from 17 April 1925 to 9 March 1926. He held this post in the 3rd cabinet of Paul Painlev√© and the 8th Briand cabinet. In the 9th Briand cabinet formed on 9 March 1926 he was appointed under-secretary of state for the president of the Council and Foreign Affairs, and retained this position in the 10th Briand cabinet until it fell on 17 July 1926. Dani√©lou was reelected on the second round in the elections of 22‚Äì29 April 1928. He was appointed Minister of Merchant Marine in the short-lived cabinet of Camille Chautemps from 21‚Äì25 February 1930. He was again Minister of Merchant Marine in the cabinet of Th√©odore Steeg from 13 December 1930 to 21 January 1931. He was reelected in the second round in the elections of 1‚Äì8 May 1932. He was appointed Minister of Health on 18 December 1932 in the cabinet of Paul Boncour, and kept this post in the 1st cabinet of √âdouard Daladier, which fell on 24 October 1933. He was defeated in the second round in the elections of April‚ÄìMay 1936. Dani√©lou remained mayor of Locronan until 1944. After the Liberation of France he left politics and devoted himself to the association of former parliamentarians, of which he was president.

The Atjeh Tram was a railroad line in Aceh, on the island of Sumatra. It was built from 1874 by the Military engineering section of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (abbreviated KNIL in Dutch). Originally a loop for the port of Oleh Leh, it was rebuilt as a route for the transport of military goods stretching from Ule Lheu to the port of Pangkalan Susu in the Sultanate of Langkat. The line was 511 kilometers long, with 120 stops and stations along the way. It was finished in 1917. During the Aceh War the railroad proved of great importance for the quick transportation of troops and material. The line was also used for civilian transportation; by 1920 it moved over 4 million people and over 153,000 tons of goods. Parts of it were used even after World War II, but due also to the Acehnese rebellion the line as a whole became derelict. A study done in 2005 by the SNCF suggested that the line could be repaired, but the narrow-gauge railway () would have to be widened to . Construction The Acehnese capital, Koeta-Radja, was separated from the coast by swamps and mudflats. Dutch troops during the First and Second Aceh Expeditions lost artillery pieces crossing this strip of land on the way to besiege the capital. Governor General Loudon announced a plan on 26 June 1874 to build a narrow-gauge railroad between Koeta Radja and Oleh Leh on the coast. A jetty was to be constructed at Oleh Leh. This line had a total length of 5 km and was known as the Atjeh Military Tramway. The gauge chosen for the track was . Iron scaffolding was imported from Singapore and wood for the sleepers from Malacca. The locomotives and rolling stock were ordered from Britain through the Dutch Consul-General in Singapore. These arrived on 5 May 1875; however shortage of labor meant that the line was not completed until September 1876. In 1884 the Military authorities decided to change the gauge from to , which was the gauge selected to be used for the \\"public\\" Atjeh Tramway from Koeta Radja to Pangkalan Susu. The 3 locomotives, 2 from Fox Walker and one from Hohenzollern, were no longer suitable and were transferred to Java Staatspoorwegen in 1884. Locomotives Three 0-6-0T locomotives were ordered in 1874 via the Dutch consulate in Singapore, 2 from Fox Walker and one from Hohenzollern. They were delivered, along with the rest of the materials for the railway, in May 1875. A class of twelve 2-4-0T locomotives were constructed for the line by Hanomag from 1887 to 1899. A further two were built in 1904 by the Kutaraja and the Sigli engineering shops of the tramway. A class of forty-two 0-6-0T locomotives were built by Hanomag and Werkspoor between 1898 and 1904. Two 4-6-0 tender locomotives were supplied by Werkspoor in 1922. Six 2-8-0 tender locomotives were supplied by Hanomag in 1930 and a further six by Du Croo & Brauns in 1931. Mallet locomotives of 0-4-4-2T configuration operated over the steep gradients; six were supplied by Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in 1904, and a further four by Nippon Sharyo in 1962. The latter firm also supplied six 2-6-0 tender locomotives in the same year. From 1882 to 1896 On 1 January 1882 a civil administration was introduced in Aceh. The operation of the line was transferred to the Burgerlijke Openbare Werken (BOW), part of the government's civil service.

In the 1990s, Mamdani gained recognition in Calgary as a financier of various startups before shifting his business efforts in the early 2000s to real estate. In part as a result of Mamdani's success in real estate, he is considered \\"one of Calgary‚Äôs wealthiest men\\".  Early life and education  Riaz Mamdani immigrated with his parents and younger brother, Alykhan Mamdani, from Uganda to Canada in the early 1970s when he was very young. His family was involved in various businesses in Calgary and in East Africa; they owned stores and real estate. Mamdani graduated from the University of Manitoba with a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy in 1992 and from the University of Calgary law school in 1996. In a 2012 interview with Alberta Venture, he said that he had taken a \\"roundabout\\" way to get to his true calling, business.  Early career  From 1992 to 1996, Mamdani served as a pharmacist at the Foothills Hospital in Calgary, while studying law at the University of Calgary. After obtaining his law degree, he was a barrister and solicitor with Beaumont Church, a Calgary-based law firm, from 1996 to 1998, focusing on corporate, commercial, and securities law.  Transition to company finance  Beginning in the late 1990s, Mamdani's professional interest and energy moved increasingly from practicing law to involvement in the financing of companies, especially early-stage startups in and around Calgary. He has said that it was these businesses' need for more office space that originally introduced him to real estate.  Strategic Group  In 2001, seeing that the real estate side of his businesses was growing the fastest, Mamdani formed Strategic Group as a way to further invest in commercial real estate in and around Calgary. Strategic Group is a fully integrated real estate company. Mamdani began the company with two properties in its portfolio. The company also owns businesses in industries that include construction, building services, oilfield services, hospitality, pet care, agriculture, technology and corporate finance. In 2015, partially as a result of the weakened Alberta economy, Strategic Group announced that it would shift its concentration from commercial properties to building rental apartments. In a 2019 letter to stakeholders, Mamdani wrote that \\"much of the growth of our company will be in our multi-family residential rental business, and approach that is directly linked to our strategic focus on sustainability and recurring revenue.\\" The company is building UPTEN, a 38-storey mixed-use building with 379 rental residences in the Beltline community near downtown Calgary. In 2019, the company completed Marda, a 6-storey mixed-use building with 65 rental residences. Under Mamdani's leadership, Strategic Group is repurposing former office buildings into residential buildings in Calgary and Edmonton. This includes repurposing the historically significant Barron Building from office into a residential rental building with 93 suites and ground-level retail. In 2019, the company completed its first office-to-residential repurposing projects including Cube in Calgary and e11even in Edmonton. Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi called Cube \\"an exciting next step for innovative development in our city.\\" Upon the opening of e11even in October 2019, Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson said \\"saving thousands of tons of waste from going to the landfill while adding critical green housing options for Edmontonians is a great accomplishment.‚Äù On the 11th of December 2019, Strategic Group announced that it had received court ordered creditor protection for 56 of the 171 properties that it owns. This judgement prevents creditors from taking action against the company as it attempts to restructure. Strategic Group is in the process of restructuring its real estate organization to adapt to the high office vacancy rates in Alberta. In 2020, Strategic Group completed two major building projects: Capital in Edmonton and UPTEN in Calgary. The latter represents an \\"unprecedented\\" building boom of residential rental towers in Calgary which is driven by a lack of supply, changing demographics, and increasingly positive attitudes toward rental living. Mamdani is an investor and shareholder in a number of other business ventures.  Philanthropy  Over the years, Mamdani has made contributions to various charitable organizations and causes. Mamdani has supported the Make-a-Wish organization, Project Warmth Society of Alberta. and Alberta Women Entrepreneurs, and is on the Board of Directors of Theatre Calgary and Alberta Champions, an organization dedicated to recognizing outstanding Albertans. Since 2012, Mamdani has worked with the Calgary Food Bank to raise food and cash donations for those in need. Mamdani entered into a multi-year partnership with Calgary Opera to support its transition to a new location. As a result of Mamdani's contribution, Calgary Opera changed the name of its building to Mamdani Opera Centre. In 2015, Mamdani offered his support of Syrian refugees coming to Canada, saying that Strategic Group would be prepared to open its properties to them. Since 2013, Strategic Group has been the title sponsor of Calgary's Mayor's Lunch for Arts Champions. In 2018, the company co-funded the creation of the Mamdani Arts Leadership Award‚Äîan annual award for volunteer board members of arts organizations in Calgary. In 2020, the award was given to Meg Van Rosendaal and Bob Chartier of Calgary's Music Mile. In 2019, Mamdani collaborated with the Canadian Mental Health Association - Calgary Region and the Lucas Fiorella Friendship Bench to unveil the first publicly accessible Friendship Bench to support mental health awareness and wellness.  Shooting  On December 19, 2016, Mamdani was the target of a shooting while he sat in the driver's seat of a Rolls-Royce Phantom in front of his home in Upper Mount Royal, Calgary. Moments following the shooting, explosions were reported in the 3800 block of 6th Street S.W. The Calgary Fire Department stated they found an empty car on fire in an alley which caused the explosions, leading to speculation that the incident was connected to Mamdani's shooting. Mamdani sustained serious injuries and has since fully recovered.

The movie was noted for successfully depicting the hardships faced by women in the rural economic conditions of Iran. Synopsis The film opens with the family of members of Amangol (Altinay Ghelich Taghani) shaving her head, disguises her as a boy, and sends her to a distant village to become an apprentice to a rug weaver. The employer is known for his harsh and suspicious behaviour towards his employees. He beats the workers for small infractions, withholds any letters they receive, and keeps the door to the small stone weaving hut locked from the outside. Amangol (who has taken the name Aman) finds comfort and solace in one the co-workers named Belghies (Soghra Karimi). A deep friendship blossoms between these ladies. Cast *Altinay Ghelich Taghani as Amangol/Aman *Soghra Karimi as Belghies *Zahra Mohammadi *Habib Haddad Reception Daughters of the Sun was met with generally positive reviews even though critics billed it as an Iranian Boys Don't Cry and found it similar to Osama and Baran - two films released during the same time. Maryam Shahriar was appreciated for developing a highly haunting and poetic mood for the movie with effective use of imageries and with minimum use of dialogues. The New York Times said of Altinay Ghelich Taghani's performance, With her shaved head and staring eyes, Aman actually looks as if she had been stripped entirely of her sexuality, like a Holocaust victim. Chicago Reader said that Taghani's passive and powerful performance as Amangol reminded them of the title character in Carl Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc.http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/daughters-of-the-sun/Film? oid=1069585 Variety applauded the technical aspects of the film, especially Homayoun Payvar's cinematography that beautifully conveyed the hardships of the characters. The movie currently holds a score of 65/100 in Metacritic.

Her main area of research has been viruses which attack the cowpea, one of the major food crops of Zimbabwe. Biography Idah Sithole was born in Hwange, Zimbabwe on 2 October 1957. She attended the University of London, on scholarship, earning a BS in biochemistry in 1982. When she was awarded a USAID Fellowship in 1983, Sithole chose to continued her education, studying plant and virus genetics. She earned a PhD in 1988 from Michigan State University (MSU) of Lansing, Michigan. She completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the Plant Research Laboratory at MSU researching the genetics of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria on the first William L. Brown Fellowship, awarded by the Resources Development Foundation. Returning to Zimbabwe, she became a Lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe in 1992 on viruses which infect plants. Her chief area of research is the potyvirus, which attacks the cowpea, a legume which is a chief food crop of Zimbabwe. That same year, she married Sheikh Ibrahima Niang, a Senegalese professor of anthropology, whom she met at Michigan State University. They have a commuting marriage, as he works at the University of Cheikh Anta Diop in Dakar, Senegal. She was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship for careers in Biotechnology between 1992 and 1995. She has continued teaching and researching, publishing numerous papers. In 2006 she was made Associate Professor at the University of Zimbabwe.

She was the wife of G. K. Chesterton and had a large role in his career as amanuensis and personal manager. Early life Frances was born on 28 June 1869, the first of seven children of George William Blogg and Blanche Keymer.Nancy Carpentier Brown, The Woman Who Was Chesterton (Charlotte, NC, 2015). Frances‚Äô mother taught her and her sisters to think independently, having them attend London's first kindergarten. She was educated at a progressive Ladies' School in Fitzroy Square run by Rosalie and Minna Praetorius, followed by Notting Hill High School. Her father died when she was fourteen years old. Later, she attended St. Stephen's College for two years as a pupil teacher. She taught Sunday school at an Anglican church in Bedford Park. Here, she became very involved in her faith by reading the Bible and devoting herself to the Saints. In 1895, Frances began working as a secretary and administrator at the Parent's National Educational Union. She worked here, planning and organising conferences, giving speeches, and editing their publications until her marriage to G.K. Chesterton.  Marriage  She first met Gilbert Keith Chesterton in 1896 and married him on 28 June 1901 in St Mary Abbots, Kensington. Throughout their marriage, Frances encouraged his writing. Because of her passion for her husband, she worked as a manager, keeping his appointments' diary and accounts, hiring his typists, and negotiating on his behalf with publishers.\\"Requiescant\\", The Tablet, 17 December 1938. Retrieved 11 November 2015.  Faith  G. K. Chesterton admired Frances' faith and how she lived it out by reading the Bible, teaching Sunday school, and taking care of the sick and elderly. Frances introduced him to the Holy Trinity and Jesus. In G.K. Chesterton's poem, The Ballad of the White Horse, he gives Frances the recognition of this impact in his life, showing that she was the reason he converted and now knows Jesus. > \\"Therefore I bring these rhymes to you > Who brought the cross to me.\\" Frances was received into the Catholic Church on 1 November 1926, four years after her husband. Within their marriage, Frances' faith was tested while coping with her brother's suicide, yet the Chestertons helped one another through hard times to maintain their relationship with Jesus. Personal inspiration Frances wished to have a large family; however, due to infertility, she was unable to bear any children. This emptiness was filled with hope that she sought through Jesus' birth. The nativity scene of Mother Mary holding Jesus inspired her works to be Christmas themed that frequently described baby Jesus' feet and hands. Each Christmas she wrote a poem for their Christmas card, one of which, \\"How far is it to Bethlehem?\\", was later published as the hymn \\"Is It Far To Bethlehem?\\".Anne Thaxter Eaton, ed., Welcome Christmas! A Garland Of Poems (New York, 1955). Death and legacy In 1909 the couple moved to Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, where they lived until their deaths. She was widowed on 14 June 1936, and died on 12 December 1938. The Charity of Frances Alice Chesterton was established by her will and was registered as a charity in 1965 (registered charity number 252034).

He compared the drive through the Valley of Rocks and along the cliff road with the Axenstrasse over Lake Lucerne, considering the Devon drive \\"the more wonderful, both as an engineering feat in road-building, and in the grandeur and sublimity of the scenery\\". Little Switzerland is the scenic landscape in and around the villages of Lynton and Lynmouth in Devon, which resembles the landscapes of Switzerland. It includes the surrounding coast and countryside: Valley of Rocks, Watersmeet and Heddon Valley. The resemblance was popularised by the Romantic Movement poets Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley and Southey: Southey had traveled to Lynton in 1799, journeying along the Exmoor coast via Porlock, and staying at one of Lynton's Inns. The poet's praise of Lynton and Lynmouth was used in publicity as the \\"English Switzerland\\" for the developing tourism industry, while his likening of the area to Switzerland sparked off a fashion for building in a Swiss style. Lynton and Lynmouth were discovered in the early 1800s when the Napoleonic Wars closed the Continent to travelers; unable to make their Grand Tour of Europe due to the conflict, visitors to Lynton and Lynmouth found the area evocative of their earlier sojourns in the Alps en route to Italy. The twin villages of Lynton and Lynmouth are situated on the heritage coast of Exmoor National Park in North Devon. Lynton stands above the harbour village of Lynmouth nestling beneath the cliffs to which it is connected by the water powered funicular railway, Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. In 1952 it was the scene of the devastating Lynmouth flood when overnight over 100 buildings and 28 bridges were destroyed, 35 people died, with a further 420 made homeless. The Lynton and Lynmouth area is now often referred to as the 'Walking Capital of Exmoor': \\"No wonder then, that the area is known as 'the walking capital of Exmoor!'\\" The South West Coast Path and Tarka Trail pass through, while the Two Moors Way, Samaritans Way South West and the Coleridge Way all finish there.

Nant-y-Ffrith refers to a stream and the wooded valley through which it flows on the border between Flintshire and Wrexham County Borough in Wales. The stream begins in moorland to the east of Llandegla. It passes Bwlchgwyn village before entering a rather steep- sided, rocky valley. It passes under the viaduct of a disused railway line before joining the River Cegidog at Ffrith. The woodlands contain some deciduous trees but are dominated by recent conifer plantations planted by the Forestry Commission after the second world war. They contain a range of flora and fauna including various ferns and mosses and woodland birds such as wood warbler and redstart. During the 1950s, people traveled from miles around to park their cars on the Drofa (or hair-pin bend in English) overlooking Nant-y- Ffrith, and listen to nightingales, whose song echoed in the valley. There are several abandoned silica quarries and lead mines in the area. Lead mining may have begun as early as Roman times and has left a number of caves. Pre- Roman/Celtic Activity The mountain on the Flintshire side of Nant-y-Ffrith in modern Welsh is called the Penllyn. Pen in Welsh literally means 'head' and is often used to describe a notable high point, a pinnacle. The name has its origins in ancient history. The Brythonic precursor to modern day Welsh used the word across Britain's landscape: 'Penmaenmawr', 'Penmachno' and the 'Pennines' in the Lake District. The ancient Welsh using the word to describe the mountain ties with evidence of roundhouse foundations discovered on the Penllyn sometime during the 1960-70s. There are also other pointers to ancient Welsh history on the mountain in its name. On older maps there are variations of a full name, 'Pen llun y gwr' and 'Pen llan y gwr'. Footbridge crossing the stream The word 'gwr' at the end is interesting, meaning 'man' maybe an elder or leader in this context. 'Gwr' also appears in the nearby village of Caergwrle. The inclusion of 'gwr' in the hillfort's name may have provided a differentiation for the ancient Welsh with other nearby hillforts, Pen llan y gwr perhaps having been a seat of tribal governance or set up by an older generation. The closest high point across the valley in the village of Bwlchgwyn is the edge of a quarry where Fronheulog Hall once stood. This site, lower than the Penllyn, was the site of a Brythonic hill fort before it was quarried away in the 19th century. Being in such close proximity, both hillforts are likely to have been built by the same people. The 'llan' of this elder or tribe leader is unlikely to have referred to a 'church' or 'parish', as in modern day Welsh, and is more likely to be an abbreviation of the Welsh word 'llanerch', a woodland clearing. That would certainly fit with the tree clearing required to build of a hill fort. 'Llyn' in the current day Penllyn, meaning lake is an unlikely candidate as is 'llun', meaning picture, which is to be found on some maps. Nant-y-Ffrith Hall Nant-y-Ffrith Hall was originally built as a hunting lodge in 1850. Successive owners enlarged the building and created landscaped gardens. An open day and garden party was held each year for local villagers. The hall gradually fell into disrepair; it was used for ammunition storage in the Second World War and finally demolished between 1947 and 1950. The only signs of it today are a clearing in the woods, scattered stones and some exotic vegetation such as rhododendrons.  Nant-y- Ffrith Waterfall  Nant-yFfrith waterfall middle tier Roughly halfway down the gorge, approximately 100m upstream of a small wooden footbridge that crosses the stream, there is a large three-tier waterfall hidden amongst the trees. The waterfall is the largest in the Flintshire / Wrexham area, the nearest other sizable waterfall being Dyserth falls in Denbighshire. The lower tier of Nant-y-Ffrith waterfall The upper tier of the falls circa 1900, showing the steps on the right-hand side. Despite the waterfall's size and significance, access is poor and public information is very limited. Access to the bottom of the falls is from a small path on the south side of the valley accessed about 20m upstream from the wooden footbridge. Access to the top of the falls is from a bend in the forestry track next to a sign warning of steep and dangerous ground. Both paths are steep, uneven and slippery. File:Nant- yFfrith waterfall middle tier.jpgThe middle section of the waterfall File:Nant y Ffrith falls circa 1900.jpgUpper tier photographed around 1900 During the heyday of Nant-y-Ffrith Hall in the second half of the 19th century steps were built up the rocks on the north side of the falls allowing viewing and access to all parts of the falls. Unfortunately, like the hall, the gardens and these steps fell into disrepair and they are no longer present, except for one section just below Wedding Cave, alongside the artificial section of the waterfall. Nant-y-Ffrith Reservoir This is a small reservoir near the source of the stream. It provides water to the villages to the west of Wrexham. Work began on it in October 1868 and it was supplying water by February 1871. It was built by Brymbo Water Company and is now owned by Dee Valley Water. Breeding birds on the reservoir include great crested grebe and coot with sedge warbler and reed bunting in the surrounding vegetation and lapwing and curlew in nearby fields.

On July 15, the 1st Battalion of the 116th Infantry Regiment, led by Major Sidney Bingham (called the \\"lost battalion\\"), unwittingly advanced ahead of other division elements and found itself isolated 1,000 yards east of Saint-L√¥ for an entire day without ammunition and with little food. They had 25 wounded, with only three nurses, and were surrounded by German forces. Planes were called in to drop plasma. Martainville hill was continuously showered by German artillery. On July 17, the 3rd Battalion, 116th Infantry, under Major Thomas D. Howie, joined up with the \\"lost battalion\\" around 4:30 in the morning. Hidden by dense vegetation, the 3rd Battalion had orders not to return enemy fire, and use only their bayonets. The mission was successful, but Howie was fatally wounded by a mortar shell explosion. Their position was then heavily attacked, preventing any further movement that day. On July 17, Captain William Puntenney, Major Howie's executive officer, requested artillery and air support to disperse the German troops. Short of munitions, still at the crossroads of the Madeleine, they found themselves at a mine depot, abandoned by the Germans. Meanwhile, the 115th Infantry Regiment passed through La Luzerne, deploying at the bottom of the Doll√©e Valley. On July 18, a company from the 116th established position along the Madeleine and the Germans retreated west to Rampan. An operations group was placed under the direction of General Norman Cota to form Task Force C. Around 3:00 p.m., the tanks along the road to Isigny were followed by ranks of soldiers. They fought their way into the Bascule district of Saint-L√¥, near the Saint-Croix (Holy Cross) church. When Major Howie died of wounds, room was needed in the ambulance for the living wounded, and his body was placed on the hood of the lead jeep, symbolically making him the first American soldier to enter the city. His body was then placed on some rubble and draped in a flag, in a photo that was widely circulated. Andy Rooney, who witnessed the event as a Stars and Stripes reporter, called this \\"one of the truly heartwarming and emotional scenes of a gruesome and frightful war\\". Legacy In memory of this battle, the name of Saint-L√¥ was given to an escort carrier of the United States Navy on October 10, 1944, the USS St. Lo (CVE-63). The ship suffered a dismal fate: after entering service as the Midway on October 23, 1943 (having been renamed from Chapin Bay while being built), it was sunk just a year later, on October 25, 1944, during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, by a kamikaze attack. In 1946, Samuel Beckett wrote a piece of reportage called \\"The Capital of the Ruins\\", in which he referred to the city as having been \\"bombed out of existence in one night\\". On 2 June 1948, the city was decorated with both the Legion of Honour and the Croix de Guerre. A monument to Major Howie, the \\"Major of St- L√¥\\", was erected in the city (see photo on the right), near the cemetery.

Founded on 20 May 2015, the group sought to expel the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant from eastern Syria. They claimed to have received training and advanced weaponry from the Authenticity and Development Front and the CIA in Jordan. In December 2016, the New Syrian Army dissolved and the remnants of the group formed the Revolutionary Commando Army. In July of 2019, U.S. defense official Mick Mulroy highlighted the work of Maghawir al-Thawra (MaT), a force composed of multiple Arab tribal members, in conducting daily security patrols to clear the 34-mile deconfliction zone around the U.S. military held Al-Tanf Garrison in the southwest of Syria of ISIS fighters.https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/07/02/fears-rise-of-an-isis-comeback/ Operational history=As the New Syrian Army The New Syrian Army was established by remnants of the Allahu Akbar Brigade, part of the Authenticity and Development Front and formerly based in Abu Kamal. The NSA was formed on 20 May 2015, and its fighters were trained in Jordan. On 16 November 2015, the New Syrian Army was deployed at al-Tanf in southeastern Syria, near Iraq and Jordan, and carried out a raid, with or without US aerial support. No further information was given. On 5 March 2016, the NSA and another FSA group, the Forces of Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo, captured the al-Tanf border crossing from ISIL in a cross-border raid from Jordan. In May 2016, an Islamic State suicide attack struck an NSA base near al-Tanf, which resulted in a large number of casualties. The attack brought to the surface underlying tensions and a lack of morale within the group, whose members alleged that the US failed to provide them with the equipment promised. In June 2016, the NSA's base near al-Tanf was hit by multiple cluster bombs from Russian airstrikes, killing 2 and injuring 18. Russia denied responsibility for the airstrike, although photos released by the NSA identified the bombs as Russian RBK-500 cluster bombs which were delivered from Khmeimim Air Base in Latakia. Later in June, the group launched an offensive against ISIL in Abu Kamal. The offensive was repelled by ISIL. On 3 August 2016, the New Syrian Army was expelled from the Authenticity and Development Front. Ghosts of the Desert The Ghosts of the Desert was an NSA-affiliated anti-ISIL insurgent group that covertly operated in ISIL-held towns in southeastern Syria and southwestern Iraq such as Abu Kamal, Mayadin, and al-Qaim. Since March 2016, they initially sprayed graffiti and raised Syrian and Iraqi flags in the towns, but began to conduct covert military activities the next month, such as sabotage, assassinations of ISIL fighters, and marking positions for airstrikes. The group supplied military intelligence to the US Air Force that allowed them to kill Abu Waheeb in May 2016 in the Iraqi town of Rutbah after the group marked his location. As the Revolutionary Commando Army Members of the Revolutionary Commando Army and a US Army soldier repair a water well in Al-Tanf. In December 2016, the New Syrian Army dissolved after internal disputes. Some of its remnants regrouped under the name of the Revolutionary Commando Army, led by Captain Abdullah al-Zoubi. On 30 April 2017, the Revolutionary Commando Army launched an offensive into eastern Syria, reaching the Deir ez-Zor Governorate and capturing the village of Humaymah, south of the T2 pumping station. Two days later, the rebels attacked and captured several sites in the region, including: Tarwazeh al-Wa\`er, Sereit al-Wa\`er, Mount Ghrab, Swab desert, al- Kamm Swab, the T3 Pumping Station, Me\`izeileh and Tarwazeh al-Attshaneh. On 6 May, FSA groups including the RCA captured several sites in the Badiya region of Homs Governorate to the south of Palmyra including Dahlouz and al-Halbeh areas. The RCA was supplied with IAG Guardian armoured personnel carriers by the US during the operation. In late November 2017, at least 180 fighters in the Revolutionary Commando Army were relieved of duty. According to the United States Central Command, the fighters \\"completed their military service\\", while according to the group's spokesman, they were removed due to their \\"weak performance\\". As result, between 40 and 60 fighters were left in the group. The unit increased in numbers after that point, with 300 fighters serving with the Revolutionary Commando Army by October 2018.

Fainstein (born 1938) is a political theorist and scholar of urban planning. Her research and writing has focused on the distributive effects of urban development strategies and megaprojects, the role of democracy and community control in local public institutions, and establishing a moral theory of \\"the just city.\\" A member of the urban planning faculties of Columbia University and Rutgers University for most of her career, Fainstein is now a research scholar at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Work=Economic restructuring and urban development Conducting field research in New York and London, Fainstein has studied the rise of \\"pro-growth\\" municipal regimes and accelerated real estate development since 1980. Her work charts the growth of public-private partnerships in urban development and increasing reliance on property development as a wholesale economic development strategy. Noting that property-focused growth has weakened urban welfare programs and broad neighborhood revitalization strategies, she has proposed reforms to public-private partnership structures that discourage overbuilding and permit broader community benefits. Theory of the \\"Just City\\" Since 1999 Fainstein has worked to theorize the ‚Äújust city,‚Äù a concept for which her 2010 book is named. Fainstein argues that urban planners need a normative theory of justice because their enthusiasm for social and built-environment diversity has not produced alternatives to inequality under pro-growth regimes. She maintains that the dominant ‚Äúcommunicative planning‚Äù paradigm‚Äîin which sufficiently inclusive and deliberative planning procedures are said to yield just outcomes‚Äîcannot produce just outcomes. This is because they cannot resolve structural inequalities among actors, settle rival concepts of the public good, or account for progressive policies achieved in non-deliberative democratic societies. Because of these limitations, planning procedures permit outcomes incompatible with justice such as greater economic inequality, marginalization of social groups, and political domination. Fainstein proposes an urban theory of justice in which ‚Äúequity, ‚Äúdemocracy,‚Äù and ‚Äò‚Äôdiversity‚Äô‚Äô are the first-order concerns of urban development, with equity prevailing when such outcomes conflict. These principles aim to harmonize the contractarian ‚Äútheory of justice‚Äù proposed by John Rawls with its post-liberal criticisms, particularly those of Iris Marion Young, who argues that the recognition of social group differences cannot be subordinated to individual distributive fairness. To reconcile tradeoffs among these priorities, Fainstein endorses the ‚Äúcapabilities approach‚Äù of Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum: all three norms must be upheld sufficiently such that they can be achieved by all moral subjects, while allowing subjects to choose priority among these basic principles. Fainstein has upheld Amsterdam's social housing program as a model of the \\"just city\\" paradigm because it supports a mix of household types, permits ethnic concentration but not enclavism, and safeguards a basic living standard. Other scholars have argued that liberalizing structural reforms since 1980 have eroded the program's claims to provide housing equity and social diversity. The topic has been engaged widely by planners and urban theorists since its introduction. Peter Marcuse and Oren Yiftachel have expanded on Fainstein's justice concept, calling for greater focus on property relations and recognition of planning paradigms outside the U.S. and Europe. More critical reception has come from urban geographer David Harvey who, extending his Marxist critique of urban planning, has argued that ‚Äújust city‚Äù theory does not remedy the inherent injustices of capitalist urbanization but instead palliates them. Fainstein has responded that the approach attempts what is feasible within capitalist development and does not \\"depend on revolutionary change.\\" Personal life Fainstein is married to urban sociology professor Norman I. Fainstein, who served previously as dean of arts and sciences at Baruch College in the City University of New York, dean of the faculty at Vassar College, and president of Connecticut College. In Fall 2019, Fainstein and her husband are co-teaching on \\"History and Theory of Urban Interventions\\" at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. She has two sons, Eric Bove and Paul Bove, and three grandchildren.

It is typically done by a batter to show off after hitting a home run. This is in contrast to the usual practice of dropping the bat straight down as the batter begins running to first base. Asia and Latin America Bat flipping is popular in Asian and Latin American baseball leagues. In South Korea, the bat flipping tradition dates back to the 1990s, and has become increasingly frequent in the Korea Baseball Organization. It is not considered disrespectful and there is no retaliation in the Korean League. In the Korean language, bat flips are referred as ppa- dun (), a portmanteau of the \\"first syllables of the words for 'bat' and 'throw'\\". The practice is also common in Japan and Taiwan. Canada and the United States In Canada, and the United States, bat flips have traditionally been considered rude and inconsistent with baseball etiquette. Traditional etiquette and the unwritten rules of baseball espouse humility and discourage actions which may be interpreted as arrogant or showing up the opponents. Torii Hunter, a retired Major League Baseball player and fan of bat flips in Korean baseball, has stated that a player throwing a bat in such a manner during a game in the United States would likely face retaliation in a subsequent at bat, such as being hit by a pitch. In April 2015, Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Yasiel Puig stated that he would flip his bat less frequently because he wanted \\"to show American baseball that [he's] not disrespecting the game.\\" Jos√© Bautista bat flip During Game 5 of the 2015 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers at the Blue Jays' home stadium of the Rogers Centre in Toronto, Ontario, during the seventh inning Blue Jays right fielder Jos√© Bautista executed what Andrew Keh of The New York Times described as possibly \\"the most ostentatious bat flip in MLB history\\" after hitting a go-ahead, three-run home run off Rangers relief pitcher Sam Dyson. Bautista wrote an article about the bat flip published in November 2015 in The Players' Tribune. He said he \\"didn‚Äôt plan it. It just happened\\", and that he was \\"caught up in the emotion of the moment\\" when he flipped the bat. Bautista was criticized for the bat flip, which he attributed to a failure to understand differences in cultural backgrounds of players. Members of the Rangers objected to the bat flip, with Rangers starting pitcher Derek Holland stating he did not object to a home run celebration, \\"but the way he did it\\". After the home run, Dyson approached Blue Jays designated hitter Edwin Encarnaci√≥n, the next batter in the batting order, and \\"told him that Jose needs to calm that down, respect the game more\\". During the post-game press conference, Rangers manager Jeff Banister stated that \\"we respect everybody\\", which the media interpreted as a strong suggestion of disapproval of Bautista's actions. Prior to Bautista's bat flip, Jays players and fans had been incensed by an overturned call that favored the Rangers. At the top of the seventh inning, with Rougned Odor on third and two outs, Russell Martin was in the process of throwing the ball back to the mound after Aaron Sanchez delivered a pitch, but the ball hit Shin-Soo Choo's bat and bounced toward third base. Odor observed this and ran to home to score the go-ahead run, though the play was initially ruled a dead ball by home-plate umpire Dale Scott and the run was voided. Rangers manager Jeff Banister came out to argue and after a discussion, the umpires awarded the run to Texas, citing rule 6.03a ‚Äì that Choo was not intentionally interfering with the throw back to the pitcher. Since Choo was in the batter's box interference could not be called and the play was ruled a live ball. The game was delayed 18-minutes while angry home fans tossed beer cans and garbage on the field. During this time, a video review from the umpires was on confirming with a rules check, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons announced he was playing the game under protest. =Aftermath= The Bautista bat flip became an internet meme. Fans posted numerous responses to the event on Twitter, and shared videos on Vine and other social media websites and mobile apps. It was etched onto jack-o'-lanterns for Halloween, printed on T-shirts and Christmas sweaters, and was also the subject of a thigh tattoo for an Oshawa, Ontario man. It was also commemorated on a Topps 2016 Series 1 baseball card. A corn maze in the Canadian province of New Brunswick was designed with the likeness of the Bautista bat flip. In 2019, the Twitter account MLB GIFS posted a gif of the bat flip after the Toronto Raptors won the Eastern Conference Finals to advance to their first NBA Finals in franchise history. Bautista's bat flip is added to NHL 17, which is an official National Hockey League simulation video game, as a personal goal celebration, albeit with an ice hockey stick. Bautista's bat flip may have been the impetus of the Jays‚ÄìRangers brawl on May 15, 2016 in the Rangers' home stadium of Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, in which Rangers relief pitcher Matt Bush hit Bautista with a pitch, Bautista made an illegal slide to second base, and Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor punched Bautista in the face, thereby igniting the brawl. Bautista was suspended for one game for the incident, while Odor was suspended for eight. The Jays and Rangers met in the 2016 American League Division Series playoffs, which was notable for Bautista slamming his bat down to celebrate a home run in Game One, and the series was a 3-0 sweep by the Jays. On May 17, 2017 in the Atlanta Braves' home stadium of SunTrust Park in Cobb County, Georgia, Bautista did a bat flip on a home run in a five-run game that led to benches clearing. One day later, Braves starting pitcher Julio Teher√°n intentionally hit Bautista in the left thigh with a fastball, apparently as revenge. The next three batters had consecutive hits, allowing Bautista and a few other runners to score.  Cricket  In cricket, the term bat flip refers to the tossing of a bat (usually one specially made for this purpose), instead of a coin, to decide which of the 2 teams in a match will given the option to decide whether it wants to bat or bowl first.

The pair have been married since 1958 and have written the music and lyrics for numerous celebrated television shows, films, and stage musicals. The Bergmans have won two Academy Awards for Best Original Song and have been inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Biography and career Alan Bergman was born to Jewish parents in Brooklyn, New York, in 1925, and studied at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and earned his master's degree in music at UCLA. Marilyn Bergman was born in 1929, coincidentally at the same Brooklyn hospital where Alan had been born four years earlier, and studied music at The High School of Music & Art in New York before studying psychology and English at New York University. Alan worked as a television director and songwriter at Philadelphia's WCAU-TV in the early 1950s. Johnny Mercer encouraged Alan to move to Los Angeles and become a professional songwriter. Despite the geographical proximity of their upbringing in New York, the Bergmans did not meet until they had both moved to Los Angeles in the late 1950s. Marilyn had moved to California and was friends with songwriter Bob Russell and his wife, Anna, and later described \\"drif[ing] into songwriting really by accident because I had a fall and broke my shoulder and couldn't play piano so I started writing lyrics\\". Marilyn also felt that she lacked the discipline or talent required to become a concert pianist. The Bergmans had both become collaborators with composer Lew Spence, and only met when Spence suggested they all work together. The Bergmans married in 1958, and have a daughter, Julie Bergman Sender, who works as an independent film producer. With Spence the Bergmans wrote the lyrics for the title tracks for Dean Martin's 1958 album Sleep Warm and Frank Sinatra's 1960 album Nice 'n' Easy. In 1961 the Bergmans wrote their first title song for a motion picture, for The Right Approach, composed by Spence. In 1964 the Bergmans wrote lyrics to their first Broadway musical, Something More!, to music by Sammy Fain. The Bergmans wrote lyrics for \\"In the Heat of the Night\\" with music by Quincy Jones for the 1967 film of the same name, which has been described as their \\"breakthrough\\". The couple would later work with Jones on Michael Jackson's soundtrack album for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), for which they wrote the lyrics for \\"Someone In the Dark\\", and the 2007 Ennio Morricone tribute album We All Love Ennio Morricone for which they wrote lyrics to \\"I Knew I Loved You\\", which was sung by Celine Dion. The Bergmans' long relationship with the French composer Michel Legrand began in the late 1960s. The couple wrote English lyrics for Legrand's song \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" featured in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), which won them their first Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 41st Academy Awards in 1969. The Bergmans and Legrand were subsequently nominated for the Best Original Song award in the following two years for \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?\\" from The Happy Ending (1969) and \\"Pieces of Dreams\\" from the 1970 film of the same name. The couple's minor work with Legrand in this period included \\"Listen to the Sea\\" from Ice Station Zebra (1968) and \\"Nobody Knows\\" and \\"Sweet Gingerbread Man\\" from The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart (1970). Legrand would also feature eight of the Bergman's lyrics on his 1972 album with Sarah Vaughan. In 1983 at the 55th Academy Awards, the Bergmans' work on \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\\" composed by Legrand for the film Best Friends would be nominated for the Best Original Song award. The 55th Academy Awards was also significant as the Bergmans became the first songwriters ever to have written three of the five nominations for the Academy Award for Best Song, being nominated for \\"It Might Be You\\" from Tootsie (composed by Dave Grusin), and \\"If We Were in Love\\" from Yes, Giorgio (composed by John Williams), in addition to \\"How Do You Keep the Music Playing?\\". At the subsequent Academy Awards, their work with Legrand on the 1983 film Yentl won them the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score or Adaptation Score, with the songs \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\\" and \\"The Way He Makes Me Feel\\" from the film also being nominated for the Best Original Song award. The Bergmans were also co-writers of \\"An American Reunion\\", the opening ceremony of the inaugural festivities at Washington D.C.'s Lincoln Memorial that marked Bill Clinton's first term as President of the United States in January 1993. In the late 1990s the Bergmans received their most recent nominations for the Academy Award for Best Original Song, for \\"Moonlight\\" (composed by John Williams) for the 1995 film Sabrina, and \\"Love Is Where You Are\\" (music by Mark Isham) for the 1999 film At First Sight. 1999 was the same year that the Bergmans received their most recent Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for \\"A Time to Dream\\"\\" (music by Hamisch) for the AFI's AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies Special. The Kennedy Center commissioned the Bergmans to write a song cycle in 2001, they chose to collaborate with the composer Cy Coleman. The resulting work, Portraits in Jazz: A Gallery of Songs was performed on May 17, 2002. The Bergmans wrote the lyrics to Billy Goldenberg's television musical Queen of the Stardust Ballroom which won the couple their third Primetime Emmy Award Outstanding Achievement in Special Musical Material, it was later the couple's second Broadway show, Ballroom, which opened in 1978. In 2007 Alan Bergman released his first album as a vocalist, Lyrically, Alan Bergman, featuring lyrics written by him and his wife and arranged by Alan Broadbent and Jeremy Lubbock. Reviewing the album for Allmusic, John Bush praised Bergman's \\"excellent interpretive skills\\" and Christopher Loundon in the JazzTimes described Bergman's voice as a \\"...revelation, suggesting both the wise, elder Sinatra and the astutely mellow Fred Astaire, with a touch of the offbeat dreaminess of Chet Baker.\\" The Bergmans have had a long professional relationship with the singer and actress Barbra Streisand. In addition to their work on the films Yentl and The Way We Were, in which Streisand starred, the Bergmans wrote Streisand's \\"One Voice\\" concert which was released as a live album in 1987. Marilyn also served as the executive producer of the \\"One Voice\\" concert. The Bergmans' song \\"Ordinary Miracles\\" from Streisand's 1994 concert tour and HBO special won the couple their third Emmy Award, with the couple's script for the tour also being nominated for a CableACE Award. The Bergmans received their fifth Emmy nomination for the song \\"On the Way to Becoming Me\\" (music by Marvin Hamlisch) from the AFI tribute to Streisand. The Bergmans have also served as board members of Streisand's charitable foundation. Streisand's 2011 album What Matters Most was recorded in tribute to the Bergmans, and featured ten songs by the couple that she had not previously recorded. Most recently, The Bergman's collaborated with playwright Josh Ravetch in 2017 on Chasing Mem'ries: A Different Kind of Musical. The play opened to rave reviews as a world premiere at The Geffen Playhouse and was the recipient of the Edgerton New Play Award. The play starred Tyne Daly, Robert Forster and Scott Kradolfer. In the play, there were both classic Bergman songs and new songs written for the play that married in seamlessly with Ravetch's text. The songs became the inner-monologues of the characters in an unusual and touching way. It was one of the best received plays in the history of The Geffen Playhouse. Awards and honors The Bergmans have been the recipients of numerous academic honors and lifetime achievement awards. The couple were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1980 and subsequently received the Johnny Mercer Award from the Hall of Fame in 1997. The Bergmans were awarded honorary doctorates by the Berklee College of Music in 1995, they also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Songwriters that year. In 1996 the couple were the recipients of the inaugural Fiorello Lifetime Achievement Award from New York City's Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School. The Bergmans were later inducted into the LaGuardia High School's Hall of Fame. In 1986, Marilyn was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award. Marilyn was later appointed an Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 1996. In 1998 Marilyn received an Honorary doctorate from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut, and in 2011 Alan was presented with a Distinguished Alumnus award from his alma mater, the University of North Carolina. The Bergmans were the recipients of the National Music Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, Marilyn was also the recipient of the Creative Arts Award from the Kaufman Cultural Center that same year. The Bergmans have held several executive positions in organizations connected with the arts. Marilyn served as the president and chairman of the board of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) for fifteen years, from 1994 to 2009. Bergman was elected president and chairman after having served five terms as the since 1984 as the first woman ever to serve on ASCAP's board of directors. Marilyn completed her term as president in April 2009 and has since continued to serve on the board of ASCAP. Marilyn also served two terms as president of CISAC, The International Confederation of Performing Rights Societies. Alan has served on the boards of directors of The Johnny Mercer Foundation, The Artists' Rights Foundation and The Jazz Bakery. The Bergmans have also served on the executive committee of the Music Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and have been board members of the National Academy of Songwriters.

He was born in Nantes and after graduating from high school Clemenceau, he studied architecture and drafting at the Polytechnique before being admitted to the Beaux-Arts where he studied art under Louis-Hippolyte Lebas. His skills as a draftsman led him to work as project architect on several major archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia and Assyria during the early 1850s. Archaeological work provided opportunities for Thomas to demonstrate his skills as an illustrator and interpreter of historic architectural buildings and he co- authored an important early book on the archaeology of Nineveh in Assyria. He turned to full-time painting in his later life and is noted for works within the Orientalist genre. Career Illustration from the book, Nineveh and Assyria by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, 1867 Initially, Thomas trained as an architect or draftsman at l'Ecole Polytechnique (1834‚Äì35). He subsequently studied art at Beaux-Arts where he was a pupil of Louis-Hippolyte Lebas who specialised in the history of architecture. In 1845, Thomas won the first Prix de Rome for a project in Architecture Cathedral. In 1849 he submitted 14 drawings of Neptune's Temple at Paestum which were very well received. In 1850, he travelled to Greece and on his way stopped at Constantinople and Smyrna.Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 923 In the early 1850s, Thomas joined several archaeological expeditions in Mesopotamia and Assyria in his capacity as an architect. The first of these expeditions was led by Fulgence Fresnel and Julius Oppert, commencing in 1851. Thomas was expected to describe the monuments and buildings that were discovered as well as to carry out quantity surveys, draw plans, prepare sketches and generally assist with documentation and drawings.Larsen, M.T., The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land, Routledge, 2014, pp 307-08 and p. 315 He was also required to make casts and stampings of inscriptions, using the new and still secret procedure developed by Lattin de Laval. Due to ill-health, Thomas left Fresnel's Mesopotamian mission prematurely. In spite of that, he still managed to contribute twelve maps to the book of the expedition, Expedition Scientifique En M√©sopotamie: Ex√©cut√©e Par Ordre Du Gouvernement De 1851 √Ä 1854 by Julius Oppert.Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924 After recovering from his illness, Thomas rejoined the archaeological team for the Assyrian excavation in 1852. The excavations, originally started by Paul-Emile Botta in 1843, were languishing, and the French government was determined to mount a large-scale operation in Assyria to showcase its dominance in the region. Victor Place, the new French Consul in Mosul hired Thomas to join the expedition as the project designer. The mission which involved the excavation of the palace of the Assyrian King Sargon II in Khorsabad (formerly Nineveh), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. Thomas made substantial contributions to the success of the excavation through his acute observations, the boldness of his reconstructions and the quality of his drawings which contributed to a rich understanding of the architecture of the Palace.Potts, D.T. (ed), A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, Volume 1, John Wiley & Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924 Many of the Assyrian antiquities were lost when the expedition's boat sank at Qnra, on the Tigris, following an attack by local rebels in May, 1855. However, Thomas, who had left earlier, retained his sketches, plans and drawings which subsequently served to illustrate a pioneering text on Assyria and the Palace of King Sargon II entitled Ninevah and Assyria, jointly authored by Victor Place and Felix Thomas in around 1867.Maisels, C.K., The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization, Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., ‚ÄúAncient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,‚Äù Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin, Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration, by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set], Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio- min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924 In this way, Thomas became a major collaborator and co-author of an important archaeological treatise. On his return to France, Thomas gave up archaeology and devoted himself to painting. He joined the studio of Charles Gleyre who became his mentor. His travels in Italy, Greece, and Turkey and the Middle East inspired his artistic vision and he began painting works in the Orientalist genre. He enjoyed only modest success in his second career as a painter. Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between his studio in Nantes and Pornic on the Atlantic coast.Larsen, M.T., The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land: 1840-1860, Psychology Press, 1996, p. 353; Pouillon, F., Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Fran√ßaise, KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924 The Baron de Girardot, in a book dedicated to him, said about him, \\"Modest to a fault, withdrawn and lonely, he painted for him.\\"M. de Girardot, Felix Thomas, grand Prix de Rome Architecte, Peintre, Graveur, Sculpteur, Nantes, 1875 Thomas died in Nantes in April 1875.

It comprises three 21-meter radio telescopes that function as an interferometer, using the technique of very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI).  Characteristics  The KVN has three main dishes, each of 21m diameter and at respective separations of 300‚Äì500 km. All three dishes are located on university campus. Two are on the Korean peninsula: Yonsei University (KY) and Ulsan University (KU), and the third is located on Jeju Island on the campus of Jeju International University (formerly Tamna University; KT). The KVN antennas are Cassegrain-types with alt-az mounts. Each telescope has a 21-m diameter main reflector with a focal length of 6.78 m. The main reflectors consist of 200 aluminum panels each with a manufacturing surface accuracy of 65 microns. A fourth telescope, the existing 14m dish located at the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory, will be linked to the KVN in the future via optical fiber networks. KVN focuses on millimeter- wavelength VLBI, and is designed to make simultaneous measurements at four different observing frequencies: 22, 43, 86, and 129 GHz. The telescopes can operate together with VLBI networks in Japan and China the East Asian VLBI Network (EAVN). The EAVN consists of 19 antennae with a maximum baseline of 5000 km operating at 22 GHz; it can also operate at 43 GHz using only 9 antennae. The first fringes for EAVN at 22 GHz were successfully detected in 2009.

The company sells a hybrid diaper, called a gDiaper, that is used with cloth inserts or disposable inserts that can be flushed or composted (wet ones only). An investigation by the Federal Trade Commission in 2014 determined that gDiapers' product claims of having \\"green\\" and \\"eco-friendly\\" baby products were deceptive and a form of false advertising. Company history  gDiapers was founded in 2004 by Australian couple Jason and Kim Graham-Nye when they discovered they would be having a child, and they began looking for an alternative diaper option to reduce the environmental impact of disposable diapers. According to co-founder Jason Graham-Nye, the goal was to create \\"the world's first hybrid diaper, essentially the best of cloth and disposable\\" (diapers). In 2010, gDiapers won Green America's People's Choice Award for Green Business of the Year. gDiapers became a Certified B Corporation (Benefit Corporation) in May 2011, and later became a partner of a maternal health organization called Every Mother Counts. Also, gDiapers' Disposable Diaper Inserts are recognized as a Cradle to Cradle Certified (cm) Silver product.  Products  gDiapers provides reusable and hybrid diapers, as well as other baby products and accessories: * gPants * Diaper Bundles * Disposable Inserts * Cloth Liners * Gentle Wipes  FTC investigation  In January 2014, the Federal Trade Commission issued a complaint that gDiapers was using deceptive claims to market their products as environmentally friendly. The complaint determined terminology such as biodegradable, compostable, eco-friendly, green, and non-plastic were misleading consumers with false representations and marketing of gDiaper products. gDiapers later reached a settlement with the FTC, agreeing to change its marketing of gDiaper products to adhere to the policies of the FTC's Green guides.

The Syriac Gazeteer. is a village in Mardin Province in southeastern Turkey. It is located in the district of Darge√ßit and the historical region of Tur Abdin. In the village, there are churches of Mor Aho, the Cross, Mor Heworo, and Mor Barsawmo. Etymology The Syriac name of the village is derived from \\"dayro\\" (\\"monastery\\" in Syriac) and \\"Slibo\\" (\\"cross\\" in Syriac), thus Dayro da-Slibo translates to \\"Monastery of the Cross\\". The village's alternative name, the Monastery of Beth El, is composed of \\"beth\\" (\\"house\\" in Syriac) and \\"El\\" (\\"God\\" in Syriac), and therefore translates to \\"Monastery of the House of God\\". History The foundation of the monastery, that would later become a village, is attributed to Saint Aho the Solitary in the 6th century, but it is suggested that it was founded earlier.Sinclair (1989), p. 320 The monastery was named after a piece of the True Cross that Saint Aho brought back from Constantinople.Takahashi (2011) Saint Gabriel of Beth Qustan is alleged to have resurrected the abbot of the monastery in the 7th century.Johnson (2008), p. 61 Dayro da-Slibo is first mentioned in 774, in which year many monks there died from plague.Palmer (1990), p. 193 Bishop Sovo of Tur Abdin is attested at the monastery before 790. In 1088, after the division of the diocese of Tur Abdin into the sees of Qartmin and Hah, Dayro da-Slibo became the seat of the bishops of Hah. Masud of Zaz, who later became Patriarch of Tur Abdin, was abbot of the monastery from c. 1462/1463 until his ordination as bishop of ·∏§esno d'Kifo in 1480/1481.Teule (2011) In the mid-19th century, the monastery became a village, and roughly 20 Assyrian families inhabited Dayro da-Slibo in 1892. Dayro da-Slibo was populated by 400 Assyrians in 1914; the Assyrian genocide in the following year resulted in many deaths, including Antimus Ya øqub of Esfes, the last Bishop of Dayro da-Slibo. 70 Assyrians were later killed by Kurds in the aftermath of the genocide. During the Sheikh Said rebellion, in 1925-1926, Kurdish rebels used Dayro da-Slibo as a military base.History. St.George Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Simhasana Church, Al-Ain. The villagers found shelter in nearby caves whilst the village was damaged by Turkish aerial bombardment. In 1967, 88 Assyrians populated Dayro da-Slibo, however, the population declined as villagers emigrated to Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Australia as a consequence of the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict. On 2 August 1992, the cemetery and villagers' houses were destroyed, and its population forcibly evacuated by the Turkish army.Atto (2011), p. 139 Villagers later returned and by 2000, the village was inhabited by 13 people. On 17 July 2004, Gevriye Arslan, the village mukhtar, was murdered by Kurds after he refused to transfer to them the land of a Christian woman who had been kidnapped and forced to convert to Islam.Baumer (2016), p. 277 Dayro da- Slibo was inhabited by 2 Assyrian families in 2013.Courtois (2013), p. 149 A land dispute over the seizure of villagers' land by a neighbouring Kurdish clan that began in 2008 was not resolved until 2015 due to the Kurds' threat of violence.G√ºsten (2016), pp. 22-23 The Kurds were dislodged from the Assyrians' land by a large Turkish military force accompanied by military helicopters.

A seismic array differs from a local network of seismic stations mainly by the techniques used for data analysis. The data from a seismic array is obtained using special digital signal processing techniques such as beamforming, which suppress noises and thus enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The earliest seismic arrays were built in the 1950s in order to improve the detection of nuclear tests worldwide. Many of these deployed arrays were classified until the 1990s. Today they become part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) as primary or auxiliary stations. Seismic arrays are not only used to monitor earthquakes and nuclear tests but also used as a tool for investigating nature and source regions of microseisms as well as locating and tracking volcanic tremor and analyzing complex seismic wave-field properties in volcanic areas.  Layout  Layout of Yellowknife Seismological Array (YKA) in Canada. Shortband seismometers are installed on blue and red sites, while broadband seismometers are installed on green sites. Seismic arrays can be classified by size, which is defined by the array's aperture given by the largest distance between the single seismometers. The sensors in a seismic array are arranged in different geometry patterns horizontally. The arrays built in the early 1960s were either cross (orthogonal linear) or L-shaped. The aperture of these arrays ranges from 10 to 25 km. Modern seismic arrays such as NORES and ARCES are located on concentric rings spaced at log-periodic intervals. Each ring consists of an odd number of seismometer sites. The number of rings and aperture differ from array to array, determined by economy and purpose. Take the NORES design as an example, seismometers are placed on 4 concentric rings. The radii of the 4 rings are given by: :R_{n} = R_{min}\\\\cdot 2.15^n (n = 0,1,2,3), R_{min} = 150m If the three sites in the inner ring are placed at 36, 156 and 276 degrees from due North, the five sites in the outer ring might be placed at 0, 72, 144, 216 and 288 degrees. This class of design is considered to provide the best overall array gain.  Data processing = Array beamforming  With a seismic array the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a seismic signal can be improved by summing the coherent signals from the single array sites. The most important point during the beamforming process is to find the best delay times, with which the single traces must be shifted before summation in order to get the largest amplitudes due to coherent interference of the signals. A wavefront coming from north-east and crossing a seismic array For distances from the source much larger than about 10 wavelengths, a seismic wave approaches an array as a wavefront that is close to planar. The directions of approach and propagation of the wavefront projected onto the horizontal plane are defined by the angles Œ¶ and Œò. * Œ¶ Backazimuth (BAZ) = angle of wavefront approach, measured clockwise from the North to the direction towards the epicenter in degree. * Œò Direction in which the wavefront propagates, measured in degree from the North, with Œò = Œ¶ ¬±180¬∞. * dj Horizontal distances between array site j and center site in [km]. * s Slowness vector with absolute value s = 1/ vapp * vapp Apparent velocity vector with the absolute value vapp = 1/s . vapp = (vapp,x ,vapp,y ,vapp,z), where vapp,x ,vapp,y ,vapp,z are the single apparent velocity components in [km/s] of the wavefront crossing an array. * vapp,h Absolute value of the horizontal component of the apparent velocity. v_{app,h}=\\\\sqrt{v_{app,x}^2+v_{app,y}^2} In most cases, the elevation differences between single array sites are so small that travel-time differences due to elevation differences are negligible. In this case, we cannot measure the vertical component of the wavefront propagation. The time delay œÑj between the center site 0 and site j with the relative coordinates (xj, yj) is :\\\\tau_{j} = \\\\frac{d_{j}}{v_{app,h}} = \\\\frac{-x_{j}sin\\\\Phi- y_{j}cos\\\\Phi}{v_{app,h}} In some cases, not all array sites are located on one horizontal plane. The time delays œÑj also depends on the local crustal velocities (vc) below the given site j. The calculation of œÑj with coordinates (xj, yj, zj) is :\\\\tau_{j} = \\\\frac{-x_{j}sin\\\\Phi- y_{j}cos\\\\Phi}{v_{app,h}}+\\\\frac{z_{j}cos\\\\Phi}{v_{c}} In both the calculation can be written in vector syntax with position vector r_j and slowness vector s_j: :\\\\tau_{j} = r_j\\\\cdot s_j Let wj(t) be the digital sample of the seismometer from site j at time t, then the beam of the whole array is defined as :b(t)=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}w_{j}(t+\\\\tau_{j}) If seismic waves are harmonic waves S(t) without noise, with identical site responses, and without attenuation, then the above operation would reproduce the signal S(t) accurately. Real data w(t) are the sum of background noise n(t) plus the signal of interest S(t), i.e. w(t) = S(t) + n(t). Assuming that the signal is coherent and not attenuated, calculating the sum of M observations and including noise we get :B(t)=M\\\\cdot S(t)+\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}n_{j}(t+\\\\tau_{j}) Assuming that the noise nj(t) has a normal amplitude distribution with zero mean and variance œÉ2 at all sites, then the variance of the noise after summation is \\\\sigma_s^2=M\\\\sigma^2 and the standard deviation is \\\\sqrt{M}\\\\sigma^2. That means the standard deviation of the noise is multiplied by \\\\sqrt{M} while the coherent signal is multiplied by M. The theoretical improvement of the SNR by beamforming (aka array gain) will be G=\\\\sqrt{M} for an array containing M sites. = The N-th root process = N-th root process is a non-linear method to enhance the SNR during beamforming. Before summing up the single seismic traces, the N-th root is calculated for each trace retaining the sign information. signum{wj(t)} is a function defined as -1 or +1, depending on the sign of the actual sample wj(t). N is an integer that has to be chosen by the analyst :B_{N}(t)=\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}\\\\sqrt[N]{n_{j}(t+\\\\tau_{j})}\\\\cdot signum\\\\\\\\{w_{j}(t)\\\\\\\\} Here the value of the function signum\\\\\\\\{w_{j}(t)\\\\\\\\} is defined as ¬±1 depending on the sign of the actual sample wj(t). After this summation, the beam has to be raised to the power of N :b(t)=B_{N}(t)^N\\\\cdot signum\\\\\\\\{w_{j}(t)\\\\\\\\} N-th root process was first proposed by K. J. Muirhead and Ram Dattin in 1976.Muirhead, K. J., and Ram Datt (1976). The N-th root process applied to seismic array data. Geophysical Journal International, 47(1), 197-210. With N-th root process, the suppression of uncorrelated noise is better than with linear beamforming. However, it weights the coherency of a signal higher than the amplitudes, which results in a distortion of the waveforms. = Weighted stack methods = Schimmel and Paulssen introduced another non-linear stacking technique in 1997Schimmel, M., and Paulssen, H. (1997). Noise reduction and detection of weak, coherent signals through phase-weighted stacks. Geophysical Journal International, 130(2), 497-505. to enhance signals through the reduction of incoherent noise, which shows a smaller waveform distortion than the N-th root process. Kennett proposed the use of the semblance of the signal as a weighting function in 2000Kennett, B. L. N. (2000). Stacking three-component seismograms. Geophysical Journal International, 141(1), 263-269. and achieved a similar resolution. An easily implementable weighted stack method would be to weight the amplitudes of the single sites of an array with the SNR of the signal at this site before beamforming, but this does not directly exploit the coherency of the signals across the array. All weighted stack methods can increase the slowness resolution of velocity spectrum analysis. = Double beam technique = A cluster of earthquakes can be used as a source array to analyze coherent signals in the seismic coda. This idea was consequently expanded by Kr√ºger et al. in 1993 by analyzing seismic array data from well-known source locations with the so-called \\"double beam method\\".Kr√ºger, F., Weber, M., Scherbaum, F., and Schlittenhardt, J. (1993). Double beam analysis of anomalies in the core- mantle boundary region. Geophysical Research Letters, 20(14), 1475-1478. The principle of reciprocity is used for source and receiver arrays to further increase the resolution and the SNR for small amplitude signals by combining both arrays in a single analysis.  Array transfer function  The array transfer function describes sensitivity and resolution of an array for seismic signals with different frequency contents and slownesses. With an array, we are able to observe the wavenumber k=2\\\\pi/\\\\lambda=2\\\\pi\\\\cdot f\\\\cdot s of this wave defined by its frequency f and its slowness s. While time-domain analog- to-digital conversion may give aliasing effects in the time domain, the spatial sampling may give aliasing effects in the wavenumber domain. Thus the wavelength range of seismic signals and the sensitivity at different wavelengths must be estimated. The difference between a signal w at the reference site A and the signal wn at any other sensor An is the travel time between the arrivals at the sensors. A plane wave is defined by its slowness vector so :w_{n}(t)=w(t-r_{n}\\\\cdot s_{0}), where r_n is the position vector of site n The best beam of an array with M sensors for a seismic signal for the slowness so is defined as :b(t)=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}w_{j}(t+r_{j}\\\\cdot s_{0}) If we calculate all time shifts for a signal with the slowness so with respect to any other slowness s, the calculated beam becomes :b(t)=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}w_{j}(t+r_{j}\\\\cdot(s_{0}-s)) The seismic energy of this beam can be calculated by integrating over the squared amplitudes :E(t)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}b^2(t)dt=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}[\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}w_{j}(t+r_{j}\\\\cdot(s_{0}-s))]^2dt This equation can be written in the frequency domain with \\\\bar{w}(\\\\omega) being the Fourier transform of the seismogram w(t), using the definition of the wavenumber vector k = œâ‚ãÖ s :E(\\\\omega,k_{0}-k)=\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\bar{w}(\\\\omega)^2\\\\cdotC(k_{0}-k)^2d\\\\omega, where C(k_{0}-k)=\\\\frac{1}{M}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}e^{iwr_{j}(k_{0}-k)} This equation is called the transfer function of an array. If the slowness difference is zero, the factor C(k_{0}-k)^2 becomes 1.0 and the array is optimally tuned for this slowness. All other energy propagating with a different slowness will be suppressed.  Slowness estimation  Slowness estimation is a matter of forming beams with different slowness vectors and comparing the amplitudes or the power of the beams, and finding out the best beam by looking for the vapp and backazimuth combination with the highest energy on the beam. = f-k analysis = Frequency-wavenumber analysis is used as a reference tool in array processing for estimating slowness. This method was proposed by Capon in 1969Capon, J. (1969). High-resolution frequency-wavenumber spectrum analysis. Proceedings of the IEEE, 57(8), 1408-1418. and further developed to include wide-band analysis, maximum-likelihood estimation techniques, and three- component data in the 1980s.Kv√¶rna, T., and Doornbos, D. J. (1986). An integrated approach to slowness analysis with arrays and three-component stations. NORSAR Semiannual Technucal Summary, 1, 2-85. The methodology exploits the deterministic, non-periodic character of seismic wave propagation to calculate the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the signals by applying the multidimensional Fourier transform. A monochromatic plane wave w(x,t) will propagate along the x direction according to equation :w(x,t)=Ae^{i2\\\\pi(f_{0}t-k_{0}x)} It can be rewritten in frequency domain as :W(k_{x},f)=A\\\\delta(f-f_{0})\\\\delta(k_{x}-k_{0}) which suggests the possibility to map a monochromatic plane wave in the frequency-wavenumber domain to a point with coordinates (f, kx) = (f0, k0). Practically, f-k analysis is performed in the frequency domain and represents in principle beamforming in the frequency domain for a number of different slowness values. At NORSAR slowness values between -0.4 and 0.4 s/km are used equally spaced over 51 by 51 points. For every one of these points the beam power is evaluated, giving an equally spaced grid of 2601 points with power information. = Beampacking = A beampacking scheme was developed at NORSAR to apply f-k analysis of regional phases to data of large array. This algorithm performs time-domain beamforming over a predefined grid of slowness points and measures the power of the beam. In practice the beampacking process gives the same slowness estimate as for the f-k analysis in the frequency domain. Compared to the f-k process, the beampacking process results in a slightly (about 10%) narrower peak for the maximum power. = Plane wave fitting = Another way of estimating slowness is to pick carefully times of the first onset or any other common distinguishable part of the same phase (same cycle) for all instruments in an array. Let ti be the arrival time picked at site i, and tref be the arrival time at the reference site, then œÑi = ti ‚àí tref is the observed time delay at site i. We observe the plane wave at M sites. With M ‚â• 3. The horizontal components (sx, sy) of the slowness vector s can be estimated by :\\\\hat{s}=\\\\underset{s}{min}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{M}(\\\\tau_{j}-r_{j}\\\\cdot s)^2 Plane wave fitting requires interactive analyst's work. However, to obtain automatic time picks and thereby provide a slowness estimate automatically, techniques like cross-correlation or just picking of peak amplitude within a time window may be used.Del Pezzo, E., and Giudicepietro, F. (2002). Plane wave fitting method for a plane, small aperture, short period seismic array: a MATHCAD program. Computers and Geosciences, 28(1), 59-64. Because of the amount of required computations, plane wave fitting is most effective for arrays with a smaller number of sites or for subarray configurations.  Applications  Current seismic arrays worldwide:  YKA  YKA or Yellowknife Seismological Array is a medium size seismic array established near Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, Canada, in 1962, in cooperative agreement between the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys (now Natural Resources Canada) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), to investigate the feasibility of teleseismic detection and identification of nuclear explosions. YKA currently consists of 19 short period seismic sensors in the form of a cross with an aperture of 2.5 km, plus 4 broadband seismograph sites with instruments able to detect a wide range of seismic wave frequencies.

It is similar to other hammer orchids in that it is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a specific species of flightless female thynnid wasp. The species was discovered and collected in 1930 but was not formally described until 2007. It is only known from three areas in the south of the state and has been declared \\"endangered\\" by the Australian government and \\"threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia.  Description  Late hammer orchid is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter, dull blue-grey in colour with darker green lines and distinct veins visible on the upper surface. There are also minute raised lumps over its surface. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. Its flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp however it can be distinguished by colouration of the labellum. The \\"head\\" and part of the \\"abdomen\\" of the insect-like labellum are light green with darker spots while the end of the \\"abdomen\\" is a dark maroon colour. The sepal at the back of the flower, the two at the sides and the petals are all long. The head-like top of the labellum is distinctly hairy and has two dark-coloured lumps at its base. Flowers appear from September to November, depending to a certain extent on location.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea confluens was discovered and first collected near Gnowangerup by Mrs. P. Andrews. There were no other collections until 1982 from Boyup Brook. The species was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The species is \\"named from the Latin confluens (confluent, running together)\\" referring to the labellum of this species having a labellum intermediate in form between those of D. livida and D. elastica.  Distribution and habitat  The late hammer orchid is only known from three disjunct populations in the Boyup Brook district, Stirling Range National Park and Porongurup National Park. It grows in sand in shrubland or woodland.  Conservation  The Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife classifies the species as \\"threatened\\" meaning that it is considered likely to become extinct, or rare and in need of special protection. The Australian Government lists its status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as \\"endangered\\". The main threats to the species' survival are human activities (such as road maintenance, reactreational activities and development), competition from invasive species (including weeds and feral animals) and dieback disease.

The school and church opened around May 1856 and operated from a bluestone building which served as both church and school. It was considered a fine example of one of the earliest parish schools established in Melbourne. History J.H. O'Connell, Parish Priest of St. George's for 40 years Following the discovery of gold in Victoria in the 1850s and the granting of statehood to the Colony, the population of Melbourne rose quickly from 177 at the time of settlement in 1836 to 80,000 in 1854 and just seven years later that figure had risen to 140,000.The history of the City of Melbourne. Melbourne City Council, 1997. (web document) Retrieved on 8 June 2015. The needs of the ever-expanding population led to the establishment of places of worship, hospitals and schools. Over the years 1855 and 1856 a simple single aisled bluestone church, consisting of a nave and tower, was constructed on land granted to the Catholic Church in Carlton. This building, known as St George's, Carlton, was to serve a dual purpose as a church on Sundays and a school during weekdays and remained in use as a school for many years. In 1866 a transept was added to the church to cater for the expanding local population and its children. James Hennessy O'Connell was made pastor to the parish in 1881 and began raising funds to expand the complex which later included the erection of a new church, the Church of the Sacred Heart in 1899, new school buildings and a hall. Prior to the formal opening of the church in 1856, a small school, known as St. George's, operated from a nearby house. In the early years the children of St George's parish were taught by Catholic lay teachers and were mostly segregated into classes for boys, taught by males, and girls taught by women. Classes were under the charge of a teacher who had received their training and certification overseas, to a large extent in Ireland. These 'head' teachers were supported by one or two assistants and came under the auspices of the Parish priest. In 1857 the school enrolment totalled over 120 boys and girls; rising to 349 in 1870 and then to 579 in 1892. The first boy enrolled was William Levers who later became a member of local government. The period 1883 to 1884 saw the erection of a community hall and new schoolroom on the south-east corner of the site which was used by the girls school. The old church building was reconstructed solely for use as a boys school in 1897 when nearby St Brigid's church commenced services and in 1913 St. George's Infant School was established. Disaster struck in November 1924 when the original church building was guttered by fire. Although much of the roof had gone new rooms were constructed from what remained of the walls and after this point was used solely as a school. The girls school St George's Girls' School Carlton began operating in the original church building around 1856 and Mrs B. Hooper was the leading teacher followed by Mrs Fitzgerald in 1881. The roll call for 1892 includes the names of 315 girls and the curriculum included singing, drawing and French. The Sisters of Charity, a religious order of nuns, took control of the girls school in 1897 and remained there until its closure. The need for more facilities continued to increase and pressure was placed on Thomas Carr (archbishop of Melbourne) at the time to provide the necessary funds to build and furnish a school for girls. Eventually a new school was constructed, comprising three classrooms, and the old building was adapted as a hall. The boys school The original St. George's church with added transept St George's Boys' School shared the old stone church, come school, with the girls from 1856 and Mr James Donovan was their teacher. The early school was staffed by Catholic laymen who gave their time to helping the Catholic poor, destitute and orphans. Donovan was followed by Mr Hickey in 1862, Mr Reidy in 1881 and Mr D. Buckley in 1885 and by 1892 over 260 boys were enrolled in the school. A cadet unit, Company E of No.12 Victorian Battalion, was established around 1890 and sports had become an intrinsic part of the curriculum. In 1902 teachers from the Congregation of Christian Brothers took control of the boys section which operated from the reconstructed church building. It continued to be conducted by the Christian Brothers for some time as they had also established St Joseph's CBC North Melbourne in the neighbouring suburb of North Melbourne. St Joseph's was to become the residence of the teaching Brothers serving St Mary's Primary School, West Melbourne, St Joseph's and St George's School in Carlton.Stewart, Ronald (2000) The Spirit of North 1903‚Äì2000. North Melbourne, St. Joseph's College Melbourne The first two Christian Brothers to teacher at Carlton were Bros. Patrick Barnabus Lee and William Emilian Staunton. Later years The Junior School of the Academy of Mary Immaculate was located at the primary school site in Pelham Street in 1986. The site was refurbished and ten years later the girls from the Academy relocated back to the Nicholson Street campus. In 2000 the site was taken over as a seminary for priests and became known as Corpus Christi College, Melbourne. Of the original buildings only the 1856 building, now used as a chapel, the new church and presbytery remain.

Their reign was short, however, as they lost the titles against The Great Sasuke and Dick Togo, but they regained them some months after. At this point, Gaina announced he was leaving Michinoku Pro and they vacacted the title, with Yuasa finally leaving for Osaka Pro Wrestling, where he became the top heel and the leader of the stable Bad Force. His involvement with M-Pro had not ended, as he competed again for them during a interpromotional feud, beating Michinoku's Takeshi Minamino with the aid of the referee Ted Tanabe, and eventually capturing the Tohoku Junior Heavyweight Championship from Great Sasuke. They claimed the title for Osaka Pro and kept it until 2007, when Gaina lost it against Yoshitsune. Similarly, Osaka Pro would receive back their tag team title from Rasse and Kagetora, thanks to Gaina and Zero. In 2008, Gaina moved to Osaka Pro's developmental territory Okinawa Pro Wrestling, where he changed his gimmick to Shisao, based on the mytical Shisa.

Career Radovan V√≠tek started his property career in Slovakia 1990's voucher privatization, before returning to the Czech Republic in 1997. In 1996, Vitek acquired an investment fund, Boleslavsko, which he transformed into his key real estate investment vehicle (now CPI). In the early 2000s, CPI acquired a wide portfolio of real properties and land in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. His primary focus was the quickly developing retail sector, as the Czech Republic was preparing to join the European Union in May 2004. During the economic downturn, in the absence of competitive bidders, Vitek significantly increased his investment into the office segment. In 2014, Radovan established CPIPG in its current format by the combination of CPI and GSG Group, the leading owner-operator of commercial real estate in Berlin), creating a platform that has become one of the largest CEE real estate groups. As of September 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth at US$4.4 billion. Through a subsidiary, Remontees Mecaniques Crans-Montana Aminona SA (CMA), CPI owns and operates ski lifts, shops, restaurants and other businesses in the Swiss ski resort of Crans Montana. During the 2018 ski season, CMA closed the ski lifts because the town council would not honor an agreement to pay 800,000 Swiss Francs (around $799,000) to CMA for the cost of late-season opening and for running World Cup races. CMA said it did this with the resort's long-term financial interest in mind. The three surrounding towns said the CMA harmed not only the resort's financial interest but also its image, and raised questions about the motivations behind their decision.  Controversies = Fined by the Luxembourg Regulator  At the end of 2017, Vitek was fined by the Luxembourg regulator CSSF in relation to the acquisition of shares in Orco Property Group, alleging an ‚Äúundisclosed concert action.‚Äù.  Lawsuit in New York, US  In April 2019, Vitek and CPI were sued in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York for $1bn of damages. The lawsuit was filed by a New York hedge fund called Kingstown, along with Investhold LTD and Verali Limited, entities controlled by Marek ƒåmejla and Jiri Divis, who were previously indicted for fraud in Switzerland. The claims included alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (‚ÄúRICO‚Äù) in the United States. The plaintiffs claim V√≠tek used a web of shell companies and ‚Äústraw owners‚Äù to gain control of Orco Property Group and that Vitek. Then sold the most valuable assets at ‚Äúdistressed prices‚Äù to entities he secretly controlled. CPI has stated that it sees no merit to the claims and that the lawsuit, for a headline-grabbing unsubstantiated amount, was intended to force an undue settlement through bad press about CPI and Mr. Vitek. CPI has also stated that Kingstown initiated nearly identical proceedings in Luxembourg in January 2015. In July 2019, the Luxembourg court dismissed Kingstown‚Äôs 2015 claim against Vitek‚Äôs CPI Property Group, saying in its ruling it wasn‚Äôt clear why the company should be ‚Äúcondemned‚Äù with the other defendants. On 4 September 2020, the SDNY Court dismissed the claims against all defendants and directed the clerk of the court to close the case.  Investigation into financial deals, Switzerland  In 2019, reports suggested that Swiss prosecutors are investigating a capital raising by (CMA) that took place in 2016 and how the funds were used to augment its stake in a related property company of which CMA already had majority control. Philippe Magistretti, CMA‚Äôs managing director, said he had not been questioned by Valais prosecutors or even asked to discuss the matter, and that minority shareholders benefited from the transaction.  Revitalization of Hole≈°ovice metro station, Czech Republic  In September 2019 Prague Public Transit Company a.s. (DPP) announced the establishment of a joint venture with Nov√© Hole≈°ovice Development (NHD). The joint venture aims to revitalize the long-neglected Hole≈°ovice metro station and its surroundings. Both DPP and NHD own the affected plots in the locality. CPI of Radovan V√≠tek, however, began to challenge the joint venture as CPI itself is interested in acquiring the mentioned plots. The land is connected to the Bubny - Z√°tory area, where the land is owned by CPI. If V√≠tek‚Äôs CPI acquired DPP and NHD land, the second richest Czech would have complete control over the vast area of the wider center of Prague. Personal life V√≠tek is married, with four children, and lives in Switzerland. In May 2015, he bought Rydinghurst, a 17th-century house and 200-acre estate in Surrey, England from British rock star Ringo Starr for ¬£13.5 million, so that his children can be educated in England.

He was born at Leeds in Yorkshire to stonemason Joseph Dixon and Susannah Bland. He married weaver Elizabeth Chadwick on 16 October 1854, and they migrated to Victoria in 1859. The Dixons moved to Sydney in 1864, where Francis joined the Operative Stonemason's Society, becoming secretary of the central committee. He was chairman in 1869 and secretary again in 1870. During this period he was often forced to leave Sydney in order to find itinerant work in the country. Having risen to a prominent position in the union movement, he was secretary of the Eight Hour System Extension League from 1869 to 1871 and was an early delegate of the Trades and Labor Council, serving from 1872 to 1882. He campaigned extensively for the eight-hour day and supported the labour movement's direct involvement in the political system. He was the chief leader of the 1873-74 iron trades strike, and helped negotiate its resolution. Dixon continued to argue for labour representation in parliament, and was the chief organiser for Angus Cameron's campaign in West Sydney in 1874. Cameron disassociated himself with the Trades and Labor Council in 1876, and in 1877 Dixon was himself a candidate for East Sydney. He became a committed protectionist, and remained a leading figure in the development of the labour movement. In 1879 he was the chair of the first Intercolonial Trade Union Congress. In 1882 he returned to the presidency of the Trades and Labor Council, moving it away from the more conciliatory stance taken by Edward O'Sullivan. The following year he became ill with lung disease, from which he died in 1884. His destitute family was supported by a collection run by the Trades and Labor Council. The Australian Dictionary of Biography described Dixon as the leading nineteenth-century trade unionist in Australia, and his attempts to have the labour movement organise politically presaged the formation of the Australian Labor Party in 1891.

Plot Living in a slum, a young woman is sent to a reform school when her corrupt parents are deemed unfit. The nuns who operate the school are eventually able to reintegrate the woman into society. She later comes across two former convicts, one of whom has served time for petty thievery. The woman successfully rehabilitates both, just as she has been. Meanwhile, she falls in love with one of the thieves; an advertisement in the New York Dramatic Mirror describes that character as a \\"past master in porch- climbing, safe-blowing and highway robbery\\", who secures a job thanks to the woman. Production Her Humble Ministry is a production of the Lubin Manufacturing Company, owned by Lubin. On its completion, the film was roughly 1,000 feet in length. It starred Florence Lawrence as the leading character. Her parents were portrayed by Spottiswoode Aitken and Ethel Elder. Arthur V. Johnson and Albert McGovern were cast as the former convicts; in the film, Johnson's character falls in love with Lawrence's. The film was directed by Harry Solter, at the time Lawrence's spouse. Lawrence, who joined the Philadelphia film studio in early 1911, was still contractually signed to Lubin in the months following the film's release. In Lubin productions, Lawrence and Johnson were often mutually typecast as an unlikely romantic duo set to marry or as an already wedded couple whose relationship is threatened over trivial matters. The film historian Kelly R. Brown called Her Humble Ministry a slight departure from Lawrence's usual roles, as an arbiter to Johnson. Her Humble Ministry was released on May 18, 1911. The film screened at the Majestic Theatre in Victoria, British Columbia, on July 13 of the same year; and at the nearby Crystal Theatre almost a year later, on June 12. Editors of the British Columbian Daily Colonist described the film as a \\"touching love story\\". A writer of the East Oregonian observed a religious motif, calling it \\"one of the most wisely conducted films\\" ever produced with such a theme. The screenwriter Monte M. Katterjohn denounced the lack of further screenings of Lubin's filmography, including Her Humble Ministry, in a 1914 Photoplay article. Seeing these productions as better produced than the perceived flood of slapstick and burlesque comedies, Katterjohn called Her Humble Ministry, among Lubin's other films, a \\"charming wor[k] of yesteryear\\". The film is presumed lost, as are most Lubin films starring Lawrence. Released in the same year as Her Humble Ministry, The Two Fathers is an exception; a complete copy was extant in the BFI National Archive in 1999.

It governed the life in the cities of Sweden until 1734. The Stadslagen was passed by in about the same time as the Magnus Erikssons landslag (Country Law of Magnus Eriksson), and as the former was to apply in the country side, the city law was to apply in the cities. The law was strongly influenced by the contemporary German city laws, as the Swedish cities at the time had many German settlers. In 1442, the country law was succeeded by the Kristofers landslag, but the city law was merely incorporated in this and left unaltered and uncontested. It was printed in 1618. It was in effect in Sweden-Finland until the Civil Code of 1734. The name Stadslag is also used as a common name for the other city laws issued in Medieval Sweden.

Early life  Airey was the eldest child of William Airey, a stone mason, and Elizabeth Airey, who were both born in Preston under Scar, North Yorkshire. He was the oldest from four siblings, the other three being Elizabeth Ann (born 1870), Edwin (1878‚Äì1955), and Maud (about 1880). The 1871 census showed the family was living at Hunslet, Leeds; by 1881 they had moved to 28 Grosvenor Street, West Leeds.  Teaching career  In his youth, Airey studied at Blenheim Board School and Leeds Central High School. He then worked as an teaching assistant at the high school in the science department. At the same time he studied at Yorkshire College (later the University of Leeds) for a University of London external B.Sc., which was awarded in 1894. From 1896 Airey taught maths at Porth Intermediate School, Glamorganshire, until 1903. At the age of 35 he left Porth to matriculate at St. John's College, Cambridge for three years as a foundation scholar; reading the Natural Science Tripos. In 1906 he received his Bachelor of Arts with first-class honours. Additionally, he received 3 awards from the college: Wright's prize for distinguished performance, the Hockin prize in electricity and experimental physics, and the Hughes prize for best third-year student. After attaining his degree, Airey went on to work in administering school systems. From 1906 to 1912 he worked as the headmaster of Morley Grammar School, now The Morley Academy. In 1912 he moved to London and became principal of the West Ham Technical Institute, a post he held until 1918. In 1915, while at West Ham, he was awarded a Doctorate of Science (D.Sc.) by London University. His final position was as principal of the City of Leeds Training College from 1918 until his retirement in 1933. On retirement an Address was presented to him:- : Not only by your own achievements, but in your own addresses to us, you have held up the torch of learning-learning which can only be won by persistent and earnest effort. : Serene in calm and storm, you have at all times steered a straight course, your actions characterized by sincerity of purpose and a love of what is right. : You will live in our memories as a Principal and a friend whose words were few, and whose happy and kindly disposition shone out so brightly that even your reproofs were tinged with humour. Not least we shall cherish your memory because you showed us a religion based on simple faith and a reverential search for truth. In 1926 he was granted a second doctorate, an Sc.D. of Cambridge.  Mathematics  Airey became a member of the Mathematical Tables Committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1911 and was its secretary from 1916 to 1929. He published many of his own tables Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation, Reports of the British Association for the Advancement of Science and in Proceedings of the London Physical Society. He was also co-editor of the Philosophical Magazine. When at Cambridge he showed an interest in computation in general, particularly in Bessel and the hypergeometric functions. He spent the rest of his life developing methods to compute these functions and tabulated many sets of functions: Neumann functions, sines and cosines in radian measure (needed in turn for the computation of transcendental functions), the Lommel-Weber function and the confluent hypergeometric functions. In a collation of notable mathematical table makers, Archibald lists Airey as one of the most prolific compilers of tables, with 49 to his credit. Many of these tables were of relevance to Airey's interest in astronomy and astrophysics. According to Dr Comrie, the British Association's tables of Emden's function were calculated by methods suggested by Airey. Airey joined the Royal Astronomical Society in 1912 and was elected a Fellow in 1931. He joined the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in November 1913, when at West Ham.  Personal life  His brother, Sir Edwin Airey was an industrialist responsible for the Airey prefabricated houses constructed in the UK after the Second World War. In 1910 Airey married Gwenllian. She had been born at Ystradyfodwg, Glamorgan about 1880. He died aged 69 on 16 September 1937 at his home of Llwynon, Newtown, Montgomeryshire, Wales after an illness of six months. His obituaries appeared in Nature and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Near Bohemia Mountain in Lane County, about southeast of Cottage Grove, the district was the most productive of the mining areas in the Western Cascades. Beginning in the 1860s, mines in the district extracted mainly gold and silver but also copper, zinc, and lead, then valued at a total of about $1 million. In 1858, W. W. Oglesby and Frank Bass, miners from California, found placer gold on Sharps Creek, a tributary of the Row River flowing out of the mountains. In 1863, Ivan (John) Ho≈ïky using the Celtic alias James \\"Bohemia\\" Johnson, originally from Bohemia in central Europe, and George Ramsey found lode gold while 'dressing out a deer on lamb from the law for killing an American Indian'. He and other miners formed the Bohemia Gold and Silver Mining District in 1867. Eventually, the district included several mines, the most productive of which were called Champion, Helena, Musick, and Noonday. Gold, silver, and other valuable metals are found in a strip wide where the Western Cascades, old and deeply eroded, run west of and parallel to the younger volcanic peaks of the high Cascades. The strip includes five major mining districts: the Bohemia and Fall Creek in Lane County; the North Santiam in Clackamas and Marion counties; the Quartzville in Linn County, and the Blue River in Linn and Lane counties. The Bohemia mining district had its own post office for about 30 years. It was established in 1893 and shut down in 1922. The first postmaster was John B. McGee.

L√°szl√≥ was fired after footage of the incident spread in the media and online. In September 2016 L√°szl√≥ was indicted on charges of breach of peace. In 2018, the Hungarian Highest Court cleared Petra L√°szl√≥ of disorderly conduct charges. Incident On September 8, 2015, Petra L√°szl√≥ was working as a camerawoman at a holding camp near the border between Hungary and Serbia, documenting the ongoing migrant crisis when hundreds of migrants including Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans fled police at a makeshift relocation camp in Roske, just a few hundred yards from Hungary's border with Serbia. A video was posted on Twitter by German reporter Stephan Richter, showing a woman who was later identified as L√°szl√≥ \\"kicking a girl and tripping up the man carrying a child\\". The video went viral and attracted widespread media attention. In response to the video, L√°szl√≥'s employer, N1TV (also known as Nemzeti TV) issued a statement saying, \\"An employee of N1TV today showed unacceptable behaviour at the R√∂szke collection point,\\" N1TV said. \\"We have terminated the contract of the camera woman with immediate effect today.\\" L√°szl√≥ later wrote to Hungarian newspaper, Magyar Nemzet, that she was frightened by the rush of people and panicked, thinking she was going to be attacked. She issued a public apology September 11, 2015: > I am very sorry for the incident, and as a mother I am especially sorry for > the fact that fate pushed a child in my way. I did not see that at that > moment. I started to panic and as I re-watch the film, it seems as it was > not even me. She characterized the public reaction as a witch-hunt including smears and death threats which she did not feel she deserved. The investigation In September 2016, Hungarian prosecutors indicted L√°szl√≥ and charged her with breaching the peace, defined under Hungarian law as \\"antisocial, violent behavior capable of inciting indignation or alarm.\\" The charge carries a maximum sentence of two years, unless there are aggravating circumstances. Zsolt Kopasz, Chief Prosecutor, said in a press release that: > The violent actions of the accused did not inflict injury, however her > behaviour was capable of provoking indignation and outcry in the members of > the public present at the scenes The press release stated that L√°szl√≥ kicked a young man and minor girl, and \\"towards a migrant who was running with a child in his arms with the intention to trip him,\\" but that her leg did not reach him. Kopasz continued that there has been no evidence uncovered to indicate that the actions were motivated by the migrant status or ethnicity of the victims. The trial was set to be held -and was held- in the city of Szeged.  Aftermath  Osama Abdul Mohsen in Getafe, Spain, in November 2015. On October 21, 2015, L√°szl√≥ stated she was considering moving to Russia following her trial in Hungary, and that she planned to file two lawsuits, the first against Osama Abdul Mohsen, the man whom she attempted to trip in the video, for changing his testimony, and Facebook for refusing to remove threatening groups on their website. L√°szl√≥ said \\"My husband wants to prove my innocence. For him, it is now a matter of honour.\\" In an interview with Russia‚Äôs Izvestia L√°szl√≥ stated she was only \\"trying to help police,\\" as Mohsen had not obeyed orders. \\"I pushed him only because I was afraid. I did not see that there was a child. I‚Äôm sorry that it turned out this way,\\" she told the newspaper. L√°szl√≥ said her life was never the same since the incident and she was dubbed a \\"heartless, racist, children- kicking camerawoman,\\" fired from her job, and threatened by haters following the scandal. \\"I can definitely say that my life is ruined. It‚Äôs unlikely that I will be able to find a job and do what I like the most,\\" she told the paper. Mohsen, commented on L√°szl√≥'s apology, \\"I tell her, be sure you Hungarian journalist that karma will get back to you, and God will not leave this be.\\" He stated in 2015 that he planned to sue both L√°szl√≥ and N1TV. Mohsen later settled in Spain when he was offered a job by a Spanish sports organization. In November 2015, Mohsen declared that he wants to leave Spain and settle down in Austria or in Germany, to organize a football team, recruited from Syrian refugees. In December 2015, in an interview, Mohsen reported that even though he asked permission from prime minister Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish authorities refused his demand for family reunion, so his family must stay in Turkey. On 15 October 2016, the Spanish journal El Confidencial reported that the Escuela Nacional de Entrenadores de F√∫tbol (Cenafe) decided not to renew the contract of Mr. Mohsen, because he had \\"difficulties learning Spanish\\". On 12 January 2017, L√°szl√≥ was sentenced to three years of probation for disorderly conduct by Szeged District Court.

Established in 2005, Betfair Australia operates Australia's only betting exchange under a Tasmanian Gaming Licence. Since August 2014 Betfair Australia has been fully owned by Crown Resorts. History Betfair UK was founded in 2000 by Andrew Black and Edward Wray. In 2004 Betfair signed a joint venture agreement with Australia's Publishing and Broadcasting Limited to start the Australian exchange. Betfair was awarded a non-exclusive licence by the Tasmanian Gaming Commission in February 2006 to conduct Australia's first betting exchange. Later that year Betfair Australia's market operations team managed its first market and shortly after the first telephone betting calls were taken by Betfair Australia staff. Operations In November 2005 the Government of Tasmania announced a deal to license Betfair in Tasmania. It was the second licence awarded to Betfair outside the UK - the first being in Malta with subsequent licences following in Austria and Germany - and Tasmania now receives substantial tax revenues. In August 2006 the first bet is matched on the Australian exchange. There have since been more than 350 million bets placed and more than two million calls have been taken. Around 400,000 unique markets have been settled. A ban on the use of betting exchanges took effect in Western Australia on 29 January 2007, with Betfair successfully claiming this new law violated the Constitution of Australia. In a unanimous verdict by the High Court of Australia on 27 March 2008, the two provisions of the legislation, purporting to ban Western Australians from using a betting exchange and prohibiting an unauthorised business from using Western Australian race lists, were declared invalid as they applied to Betfair. The provisions were characterised as imposing a burden on interstate trade that was protectionist in nature, and therefore contravened section 92 of the Commonwealth Constitution.. However, in the 2012 High Court case of Betfair Pty Limited v Racing New South Wales, Betfair's appeal, against a newly enacted fee to access New South Welsh vital race field information, was rejected.. The Court held that the relevant law would have no discriminatory or protectionist effect on interstate trade, thereby complying with section 92 of the Constitution of Australia, and that Betfair had not proven that the fee would cause significant economic damage (not to the extent of the appellants in Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia).. In August 2014 Betfair completed the sale of their 50% stake in Betfair Australia to venture partner Crown Resorts, one of Australia's largest gaming and entertainment groups. The stake was valued at ¬£5.5m. In 2008 it was calculated that Betfair handle more transactions than all of Europe's stock exchanges combined ‚Äì an average of 5 million a day, 99.9% are successfully completed in under one second. Betfair Australia set a world record for most money traded in a single market in March 2015 when $184,383,446 was matched in-play for the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup semi-final between South Africa and New Zealand. In a see-sawing match favouritism changed 31 times throughout the game with South Africa trading at $1.58 in the last over and then going on to lose with $8.58mil matched on them at less than $1.35. Betting Exchange Betfair Australia is the only betting exchange in operation in Australia. A betting exchange is a marketplace for customers to bet on the outcome of discrete events. Betting exchanges offer the same opportunities to bet as a bookmaker with a few differences. You can buy and sell the outcome, you can trade in real-time throughout the event and you trade out to cut your losses or lock in profit. Bookmaker operators generate revenue by offering less efficient odds. Betting exchanges normally generate revenue by charging a transaction fee. Traditionally betting has occurred between a customer and a bookmaker where the customer 'backs' (bets that an outcome will occur) and the bookmaker 'lays' (bets that the outcome will not occur). Betting exchanges offer the opportunity for anyone to both back and lay. For example, if someone thinks Team A will win a competition, he may wish to back that selection. A bookmaker offering the punter that bet would be laying that selection. The two parties will agree the backer's stake and the odds. If the team loses, the layer/bookmaker keeps the backer's stake. If the team wins, the layer will pay the backer the winnings based on the odds agreed. As every bet transacted requires a backer and a layer, and the betting exchange is not a party to the bets transacted on it, any betting exchange requires both backers and layers.

The 2D Z-transform is defined by :X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{\\\\infty} x(n_1,n_2) z_1^{-n_1} z_2^{-n_2} where n_1,n_2 are integers and z_1,z_2 are represented by the complex numbers: :z_1 = Ae^{j\\\\phi_1} = A(\\\\cos{\\\\phi_1}+j\\\\sin{\\\\phi_1})\\\\, :z_2 = Be^{j\\\\phi_2} = B(\\\\cos{\\\\phi_2}+j\\\\sin{\\\\phi_2})\\\\, The 2D Z-transform is a generalized version of the 2D Fourier transform. It converges for a much wider class of sequences, and is a helpful tool in allowing one to draw conclusions on system characteristics such as BIBO stability. It is also used to determine the connection between the input and output of a linear Shift-invariant system, such as manipulating a difference equation to determine the system's Transfer function. Region of Convergence (ROC) The Region of Convergence is the set of points in complex space where: :ROC = X_z(z_1,z_2) < \\\\infty In the 1D case this is represented by an annulus, and the 2D representation of an annulus is known as the Reinhardt domain.Dan E. Dudgeon, Russell M. Mersereau, ‚ÄúMultidimensional Digital Signal Processing‚Äù, Prentice-Hall Signal Processing Series, , 1983. From this one can conclude that only the magnitude and not the phase of a point at (z_1,z_2) will determine whether or not it lies within the ROC. In order for a 2D Z-transform to fully define the system in which it means to describe, the associated ROC must also be know. Conclusions can be drawn on the Region of Convergence based on Region of Support (mathematics) of the original sequence (n_1,n_2). Finite Support Sequences A sequence with a region of support that is bonded by an area (M_1,M_2) within the (n_1,n_2) plane can be represented in the z-domain as: :X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{M_1}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{M_2} x(n_1,n_2) z_1^{-n_1} z_2^{-n_2} Because the bounds on the summation are finite, as long as z1 and z2 are finite, the 2D Z-transform will converge for all values of z1 and z2, except in some cases where z1 = 0 or z2 = 0 depending on x(n_1,n_2). First Quadrant and Wedge Sequences Sequences with a region of support in the first quadrant of the (n_1,n_2) plane have the following 2D Z-transform: :X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{\\\\infty} x(n_1,n_2) z_1^{-n_1} z_2^{-n_2} From the transform if a point z01,z02 lies within the ROC then any point with a magnitude : \\\\left z_1 \\\\right \\\\text{ ‚â• } \\\\left z_{01} \\\\right ; \\\\left z_2 \\\\right \\\\text{ ‚â• } \\\\left z_{02} \\\\right also lie within the ROC. Due to these condition, the boundary of the ROC must have a negative slope or a slope of 0. This can be assumed because if the slope was positive there would be points that meet the previous condition, but also lie outside the ROC. For example, the sequence: :x_n(n_1,n_2) = a^n_1\\\\delta(n_1-n_2)u[n_1,n_2] has the z transform :X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\frac{1}{1 - az_1^{-1}z_2^{-1}} It is obvious that this only converges for : \\\\left a \\\\right < \\\\left z_{01} \\\\right\\\\left z_{02} \\\\right = \\\\ln(\\\\left a \\\\right) < \\\\ln(\\\\left z_{01} \\\\right) - \\\\ln(\\\\left z_{02} \\\\right) So the boundary of the ROC is simply a line with a slope of -1 in the ln(z01),ln(z02) plane. In the case of a wedge sequence where the region of support is less than that of a half plane. Suppose such a sequence has a region of support over the first quadrant and the region in the second quadrant where n01 = -Ln02. If l is defined as l = 01+Ln02 the new 2D Z-Transform becomes: :X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\sum_{n_1=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\sum_{n_2=0}^{\\\\infty} x(l-Ln_2,n_2) z_1^{-l+Ln_2} z_2^{-n_2} Sequence with Region of support over a wedge and its corresponding ROC This converges if: : \\\\left z_1 \\\\right \\\\text{ ‚â• } \\\\left z_{01} \\\\right ; \\\\left z_1^{-L}z_2 \\\\right \\\\text{ ‚â• } \\\\left z_{01}^{-L}z_{02} \\\\right These conditions can then be used to determine constraints on the slope of the boundary of the ROC in a similar manner to that of a first quadrant sequence. By doing this one gets: ln(\\\\left z_1 \\\\right) \\\\text{ ‚â• } ln(\\\\left z_{01}) \\\\right) and ln(\\\\left z_2 \\\\right) \\\\text{ ‚â• } Lln(\\\\left z_{1}) \\\\right)+(ln(\\\\left z_{02}) \\\\right)-Lln(\\\\left z_{01}) \\\\right)) Sequences with Region of Support in all Quadrants A sequence with an unbounded Region of Support can have an ROC in any shape, and must be determined based on the sequence (n_1,n_2). A few examples are listed below: :x_n(n_1,n_2) = e^{(-n_1^{2}-n_2^{2})} will converge for all z1,z2. While: :x_n(n_1,n_2) = a^{(n_1)}a^{(n_2)} , a \\\\text{ ‚â• } 1 will not converge for any value of z1,z2. However, These are the extreme cases, and usually, the Z-transform will converge over a finite area. A sequence with support over the entire n1,n2 can be written as a sum of each quadrant sequence: :x_n(n_1,n_2) = x_1(n_1,n_2) + x_2(n_1,n_2) + x_3(n_1,n_2) + x_4(n_1,n_2) Now Suppose: x_1(n_1,n_2) = \\\\begin{cases} x_n(n_1,n_2), & \\\\mbox{if } n_1 > 0, n_2 > 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.5x_n(n_1,n_2), & \\\\mbox{if } n_1 = 0, n_2 > 0 ; n_1 > 0, n_2 = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0.25x_n(n_1,n_2), & \\\\mbox{if } n_1 = n_2 = 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, otherwise \\\\end{cases} and x_2(n_1,n_2), x_3(n_1,n_2), x_4(n_1,n_2) also have similar definitions over their respective quadrants. Then the Region of convergence is simply the intersection between the four 2D Z-transforms in each quadrant. Using the 2D Z-transform to solve difference equations A 2D difference equation relates the input to the output of a Linear Shift-Invariant (LSI) System in the following manner: \\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}b(k_1,k_2)y(n_1-k_1,n_2-k_2)=\\\\sum_{r_1=0}^{R_1-1}\\\\sum_{r_2=0}^{R_2-1}a(r_1,r_2)x(n_1-r_1,n_2-r_2) Due to the finite limits of computation, it can be assumed that both a and b are sequences of finite extent. After using the z transform, the equation becomes: Y_z(z_1,z_2)\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}b(k_1,k_2)z_1^{-k_1}z_2^{-k_2} = X_z(z_1,z_2)\\\\sum_{r_1=0}^{R_1-1}\\\\sum_{r_2=0}^{R_2-1}a(r_1,r_2)z_1^{-r_1}z_2^{-r_2} This gives: H_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\frac{X_z(z_1,z_2)}{Y_z(z_1,z_2)} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k_1=0}^{K_1-1}\\\\sum_{k_2=0}^{K_2-1}a(k_1,k_2)z_1^{-k_1}z_2^{-k_2}}{\\\\sum_{r_1=0}^{R_1-1}\\\\sum_{r_2=0}^{R_2-1}b(r_1,r_2)z_1^{-r_1}z_2^{-r_2}} = \\\\frac{A_z(z_1,z_2)}{B_z(z_1,z_2)} Thus we have defined the relation between the input and output of the LSI system.

For example, the sequence: x(n_1,n_2) = 3\\\\delta(n_1,n_2)+6\\\\delta(n_1-1,n_2)+2\\\\delta(n_1,n_2-1)+4\\\\delta(n_1-1,n_2-1) has the Z-transform: X(z_1,z_2) = 3 + 6z_1^{-1} + 2z_2^{-1} + 4z_1^{-1}z_2^{-1} As this is a finite sequence the ROC is for all z1,z2. Approach 2: Sequences with values along only n1 or n2 For a sequence with a region of support on only n1 = 0 or n2 = 0, the sequence can be treated as a 1D signal and the 1D Z-transform can be used to solve for the 2D Z-transform. For example, the sequence: X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\delta(n_1), & \\\\mbox{if } 0 \\\\text{‚â§} n_2 \\\\text{‚â§} N-1\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, otherwise \\\\end{cases} Is clearly given by u[n_2]-u[n_2-N]. Therefore, its Z-transform is given by: X_z(z_1,z_2) = 1+z_2^{-1}+z_2^{-2}+...+z_2^{-N+1} X_z(z_1,z_2) = \\\\begin{cases} N, & \\\\mbox{if } z_2 = 1\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{1-z_2^{-N}}{1-z_2^{-1}}, otherwise \\\\end{cases} As this is a finite sequence the ROC is for all z1,z2. Approach 3: Separable Sequences A separable sequence is defined as x(n_1,n_2) = f(n_1)g(n_2) For a separable sequence finding the 2D Z-transform is as simple as separating the sequence, taking the product of the 1D Z-transform of each signal f(n_1) and g(n_2). For example, the sequence: x(n_1,n_2) = a^{n_1+n_2}u[n_1,n_2] = a^{n_1}u[n_1]a^{n_2}u[n_2]= f(n_1)g(n_2) Therefore, its Z-transform is given by X_z(z_1,z_2) = F_z(z_1)G(z_2) = (\\\\frac{1}{1-az_1^{-1}})(\\\\frac{1}{1-az_2^{-1}}) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-az_1^{-1})(1-az_2^{-1})} The ROC is given by: \\\\left z_1 \\\\right > \\\\left a \\\\right ; \\\\left z_2 \\\\right > \\\\left a \\\\right References Digital signal processing Multidimensional signal processing ","title":"2D Z-transform"},{"id":"48530186","text":"Francis Bede Freehill (22 November 1854 - 12 March 1908) was an Australian solicitor and activist.

It first appeared in Maclean‚Äôs Magazine in America in 1927. It was after published in 1928 in England in the Strand Magazine, illustrated by Charles Brock. It finally came out in book format in 1932, in the collection Limits and Renewals. Plot The story is framed with a dinner party attended by the narrator where one of his friends, a doctor named Keede, relates a youthful adventure. The body of a young girl was found outside his village one night under mysterious circumstances. A trowel was found by her body, apparently the weapon with which the murder had been committed. Her lover was suspected; they had quarrelled that night, but there was no evidence against him and the affair was dropt for a time. Keede himself had suspicions in another quarter; he had passed the spot on the night and seen a man with a woman's body, and not realising she was dead, reported the affair to the police. They ignored the clew, and Keede determined to \\"play Sherlock Holmes\\" on his own account. He was able to trace the man by the plates on his motorcycle, and Keede and a friend paid him a visit at his house. They found him to be a returned soldier, Henry Wollin, now an enthusiastic gardener, in the care of his housekeeper. She told them how he had been wounded and gassed in the Great War, come home suffering from shock - Fairy-kist she called it - and how she had nursed him ever since. Wollin, realising from their questioning that he was suspected, appeared to flee disappeared for some time. On his reappearance Keede and his friend Lemming had returned to the scent, only to learn that the murder had been solved and their suspicions were groundless - a passing lorry had struck and killed the girl. Puzzled as to why Wollin had behaved in so guilty a fashion, Keede eventually discovered the truth from himself. He had been out that night on his motorcycle on one of his customary eccentric expeditions, planting flowers. Coming across the girl's body, had stopt to investigate when Keede coming up in his car had so panicked him that he had fled, leaving his trowel behind. Terrified of being suspected of the murder, he had bought a new trowel, and committed other similar acts to hide his own trail, and incidentally make himself seem the real criminal. When he thought the police were on his track he had hidden in his cellar for a month. Wollin was even afraid of being arrested for planting roots in the country, as he had been on the night of the tragedy. He is convinced he is mad, and had heard voices while he had been in hospital bidding him plant gardens. In fact, Keede's friend Lemming, a doctor, discovered that the supposed voices had been no more than the hospital nurse reading to him a book, Mrs Ewing's Mary's Meadow, while he had been delirious. When he explained this to Wollin, the latter was vastly relieved, and realising that he was not mad, had recovered forthwith. Criticism The story's reception from the critical world was mixed but, on the whole, unfavourable. Like many of Kipling's other works, its theme is the trauma of returned soldiers.

He is remembered as a fraudster who sold faked and altered historical musical instruments. To this day his work is a barrier to the scholarly study of instruments of the past. Career This clavicytherium, sold by Franciolini and kept in the Hans Adler Collection of Musical Instruments today, is unlike any authentically attested instrument of this kind. It formed part of the prosecution's evidence in Franciolini's criminal trial; see below. Little is known about Franciolini's life. According to census records he was born 1 March 1844, was married in 1879, and had six children of whom one died before reaching adulthood.Ripin p. xii The census listed his occupation as organist as well as antiquary. It is possible that he founded his workshop in 1879, a date listed on his catalogs. The workshop was at various locations in Florence; during part of its existence his business was housed in more than one location. Franciolini repeatedly sold fake instruments or instruments that were modified in his workshop to make them more appealing to na√Øve buyers. For instance, he added various forms of decoration, or even entire extra keyboards to harpsichords. He also attached dates to instruments to make them seem older and gave them false signatures of builders. His modifications damaged the musical value of the instruments and especially their scholarly value, making them less useful in service of modern builders, who rely on historical instruments for their design.Kottick (2003:405) As Ripin notes, it will not suffice for modern scholars or buyers simply to ignore all instruments that were once in Franciolini's possession, because a great number of valuable authentic instruments passed through his shop as well. These were sometimes modified to look more like the fraudulent instruments, thus giving the latter more credibility.Ripin, p. ix The character of the fraudulent instruments Franciolini's modifications of old instruments are often crude, involving, for instance, naive forms of decorative art, as well as misspellings of builder's names and errors in Latin mottos. Of the latter Ripin writes (p. x) \\"The countless errors in his inscriptions reveal Franciolini not merely never to have studied Latin, but also to have been unable to copy even the simplest Latin phrase correctly.\\" Kottick points out one harpsichord in which the bridge for the added, short- scale four-foot strings is not only crude but even larger than the main bridge, an absurdity in normal harpsichord construction.Kottick (2003:404) At one point early in his career, Franciolini was so ignorant as to produce a keyboard in which the sharps all fell in groups of three rather than the familiar alternating twos and threes.Ripin, p. x A specialization of Franciolini was adding extra manuals (i.e. keyboards) to old harpsichords. For instance, Franciolini concocted a total of five three-manual harpsichords,Ripin, p. 15. All of these are discussed at various locations in this article; see below. They reside in museums in Munich, Nuremberg, Edinburgh, Ann Arbor, and Vermillion. substantially outnumbering the one three-manual harpsichord known to be historically authentic.For the latter, see Hieronymus Albrecht Hass. The two-manual harpsichord was rare in Italy, and Kottick suggests that for essentially any museum instrument described as an Italian two-manual, it is likely that the second manual comes from Franciolini's workshop.Kottick (2003:403) Clientele Frederick Stearns, businessman (pharmaceuticals) and collector of musical instruments, repeatedly gulled by Franciolini Franciolini worked at a time when many of the great musical instrument collections (stored in museums today) were being built up through purchase by individual wealthy collectors. There was little published scholarship available to protect such buyers from falling victim to his frauds, and thus the collections passed on later to the museums were rife with them.Kottick (2003:404-405) Different collectors did more or less well at detecting Franciolini's forgeries. For instance, the early music pioneer Arnold Dolmetsch, himself a builder, frequented Franciolini's shop, and easily spotted the frauds happening there.For the reminiscences of Dolmetsch and his wife Mabel concerning Franciolini, see Ripin (1974:ix-x). On the other hand, the American collector Frederick Stearns snapped up Franciolini items with such indiscriminate enthusiasm that a century later he was castigated by the scholars who preside over his collection in Ann Arbor today; i.e. the Stearns Collection of Musical Instruments. Describing one instrument, they write: > In this case, we have an Alto Clarinet in F. ... It is a composite > instrument with four sections: two are leather-covered maple, ... the barrel > appears to have been purloined from a bass clarinet ... the bell from an > oboe. The mouthpiece appears to be re-purposed from a bass clarinet. ... The > simultaneous crudeness and creativity demonstrated in [Franciolini's] > catalogue is greatly entertaining. More troubling, however, is the shadow > cast upon the flawed judgment of Frederick Stearns in his last years of > collecting. It is possible, according to Kottick, that some of Franciolini's customers didn't really care about fraud, since their interest was in early instruments as vivid decorative objects, not as scholarly artifacts. This view is also taken by the modern luthier/dealer Sinier de Ridder, who suggests moreover that Franciolini \\"was not the only one to offer to a rich clientele musical objects intended for decoration.\\" Source: de Ridder's website: His arrest and prosecution Franciolini prospered in his fraudulent business for many years. In 1909, however, he committed a fraud that led to his arrest. The facts are not entirely clear from the record, but Ripin offers a plausible conjecture.Ripin's account appears in Ripin (1974:182-183). According to Ripin, the source of Franciolini's legal trouble was his dealings with another sharp operator. A Count PasseriniFull name Giuseppe Passerini Cerretesi; Ripin p. 195 bought a large group of instruments, including fraudulent ones, from Franciolini, and resold them at a higher price to Wilhelm Heyer, an outstanding German collector in Cologne.Heyer's instruments today form part of the important collection of the Museum of Musical Instruments of the University of Leipzig. The resale took place through an intermediary, a Florentine bookseller known to Heyer (Ripin p. 197). Passerini added his own deception: he concealed the fact that he had purchased them from Franciolini, and claimed instead that the instruments had been found in a palazzo in Siena. Heyer quickly spotted the fraudulent character of the collection. He was an astute collector, and the task of detecting Passerini's deception was not even especially difficult: some of the instruments retained labels from Franciolini's shop or were already listed in a Franciolini catalog.Ripin, p. 199 On ascertaining the deception Heyer returned the collection to Count Passerini, who sued Franciolini as well as filing a complaint with the state prosecutor.Ripin, p. 195 Brauchli writes \\"it is highly improbable that Franciolini, well aware of Heyer's reputation, would have tried himself to deceive Heyer so boldly.\\"Source for this paragraph: Brauchi (1998:296‚Äì297); Brauchli's assessment echoes Ripin p. 182. Franciolini's trial in 1910 attracted considerable attention; it was reported in La Nazione that \\"a large audience composed of antiquaries, art connoisseurs, artists, etc.\\" attended it.The two relevant articles from La nazione are reprinted with English translation in Ripin (1974:192-195). A court of three judges found the prosecution's evidence fully convincing and the defense's evidence fully unconvincing; and in their verdict they described some of the more vivid instances of forgery (see above) with relish.The full report of the court is given in Ripin (1974:181-191). > A certain virginal, for example, ... was made from piano keys joined > together in pairs and filed down and encased in such a way that they could > not be able to accomplish the purpose for which they had been intended; a > clavicytherium attributed to Sixtus V was nothing but a housing into which > the parts of some instrument had been introduced, together with pieces of > new wood hidden by a patina intended to simulate age;This is evidently the > instrument shown in the image at the start of this article. The coat of arms > displayed at the top of the instrument is that of Pope Sixtus V, who is > mentioned as a possible former owner in Franciolini's catalog description > (Ripin, p. 67). Franciolini's own sales photograph of the instrument is > printed on p. 99 of Ripin, and Ripin's commentary on p. 155. a small organ > catalogued as being from the Empire period had pasted inside it a list of > modern tunes, among which were Bellini's Norma and Sonnambula, a chitarrone > said to be inlaid with ivory (according to the catalog) was instead mere > celluloid; a cello attributed to Andrea Guarnieri no less and another to > Della Corna of Brescia were instead no more than unskilled and patent > forgeries.Ripin p. 189 Franciolini was convicted and sentenced to four months in prison. This was commuted to a fine of 1000 lire.Concerning the value of the lira at the time: Franciolini's fifth catalog lists ordinary single-manual harpsichords at 200 to 500 lire, and one of his spectacular three-manual creations at 7000 lire. The lot he sold to Passerini was priced at about 12,500 lire. See The Franciolini business in later years The punishment did not deter Franciolini from further frauds; he continued operating his instrument-forgery business in the remaining years of his life. Heyer may have attempted to alert other collectors to Franciolini's activities; an anonymous article appeared in the German-language organological journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumentenbau reporting the Passerini episode from Heyer's own point of view,Anonymous (1910) \\"Der Instrumentf√§lscher Franciolini vor Gericht,\\" Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumentenbau Vol. 30, no. 19 (1 April), p. 715. [\\"The instrument forger Franciolini on trial\\", in Journal of instrument construction]. The article is reprinted, with English translation, in Ripin (1974). and according to Ripin this did help prevent some collectors from being taken in. But outside German- speaking countries, there were still plenty of customers who didn't know about Franciolini's conviction, so it was still possible to some degree for him to continue business as usual.Ripin, p. xiv. To this might be added customers who knew that Franciolini's instruments were fakes but didn't care; see remarks on \\"Clientele\\" above. Franciolini instruments continue to be sold even today; see \\"Dealers and auction houses\\" below. A particularly brazen sale appears to have taken place in 1911. As the Zeitschrift f√ºr Instrumentenbau reported,See Ripin, pp. 200-201. Franciolini's son Luigi traveled to London with his brother-in-law, bringing a set of instruments purporting to be from the estate of the senior Franciolini, whom they claimed to have died. Among their instruments was a fake three-manual harpsichord derived from a 1627 single- manual by Stefano Bolcioni. It appears that the Franciolinis had redecorated it, so that it would no longer match the sales photograph they had circulated earlier. The instrument probably was successfully sold at the time; it eventually made its way to the Russell Collection in Edinburgh.For the redecoration, see O'Brien, who discusses the clear evidence that redecoration had taken place, without necessarily assuming that the redecoration was done by the Franciolinis. The redecorated version clearly matches the style of other Franciolini instruments portrayed in Ripin (1974). O'Brien both reproduces the Franciolini sales photograph and provides an image of the instrument in its current state. Franciolini really did die in 1920 (10 February, of bronchial pneumonia),Ripin p. xv but the business still continued under the direction of his sons. However, Ripin notes (p. xv) that by then \\"the halcyon days were over. The large-scale and frequently indiscriminate collecting of Italian works of art that characterized the late 19th century and early years of the 20th came to an end with a gradual increase in the expertise of museum curators and private collectors alike.\\" The Franciolini family business gradually wound down, and at least one of his sons found a new occupation. Musical instrument forgeries continue today (see Koster 2000 for a recent case), but they now require far more skill than was brought to the task by Franciolini. Coping with Franciolini frauds in modern times=Museums and curators ottavino (tiny harpsichord, one octave higher in pitch than standard) thought to be a Franciolini fabrication. See main text for details. Various modern museum curators have taken pains to publicly identify items in their collections known to be Franciolini frauds. For example, the Stearns Collection, noted above, scrupulously notifies its patrons on its website and gallery entrance that many of the instruments it owns are Franciolini items.Stearns: . The curators of the Musical Instrument Museum in Berlin say of the ottavino displayed at right, \\"trapezoid ottavino, described as 'Antonius Antagnatius, Brescia, 1583' (probably a forgery by Leopoldo Franciolini). Italy, mid 17th century and second half of 19th century.\\"Original German: ‚ÄúTrapezf√∂rmiges Oktavspinett, bezeichnet ‚ÄûAntonius Antagnatius, Brescia, 1583‚Äú (vermutlich F√§lschung von Leopoldo Franciolini). Italien, Mitte 17. Jh. und 2. H√§lfte 19. Jh.\\" This description may be read off the image in full magnification by clicking on it twice.Two other cases may be given. The curators at the Russell Collection in Edinburgh duly note of the 1627 Stefano Bolcioni harpsichord mentioned above that it was \\"converted [to three manuals] ... by Leopold Franciolini\\" (see ; and the curators of the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota observe of their own Franciolini three-manual, \\"Grand piano\\" by Vincenzio Sodi, Florence, 1789. Fraudulently rebuilt as a three-manual harpsichord by Leopoldo Franciolini, Florence, c. 1900; see . The curators at the Hans Adler Memorial Collection in South Africa give \\"equal time\\" to Franciolini, mentioning his own attribution for the clavicytherium described above, but also mentioning its appearance in the story of Franciolini's criminal prosecution.Source: their web site, at . At the other end of the scale, the curators of the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, Germany straightforwardly list on their website a three-manual harpsichord, listing its inscription (correctly) as \\"Bartholomeo Christofari Patavinus fecit Florentiae 1703\\"; i.e. Bartolomeo Cristofori, but not mentioning the evidence that it is not by Cristofori at all but is rather a Franciolini fraud.The Nuremberg listing appears in . The Cristofori attribution is the same as that of the acknowledged Franciolini three-manual harpsichords in Ann Arbor and Munich, discussed below. The Nuremberg instrument appears in a Franciolini sales photograph printed in Ripin (1974: 134, 159), bears the normal decoration of Franciolini instruments, and is identified by this site as Franciolini's work. More generally, instrument scholar Laurence Libin has written, \\"Franciolini['s] products are all too common yet sometimes unacknowledged.\\"See his review of Kielklaviere: Cembali, Spinette, Virginale, Bestandskatalog mit Beitragen von John Henry van der Meer, Martin Elste, and Gunther Wagner. Beschreibung der Instrumente von Horst Rase und Dagmar Droysen-Reber. Berlin: Staatliches Institut fur Musikforschung Preussischer Kulturbesitz, 1991, published in Notes, Second Series, Vol. 50, No. 1 (Sep. 1993), pp. 184-186. On line at . Most large musical instrument museums lack the gallery space needed to display all of their instruments in public. Curators have sometimes responded to the realization that an instrument is a Franciolini fraud by shifting it from the public galleries into storage.See, e.g. Orlando (2002:9). Orlando dates the trend to putting Franciolinis out of sight to about 1972, though Kottick and Lucktenberg certainly spotted quite a few residual Franciolini instruments in doing the research for their (1997) book. See Susan Orlando, \\"Introduction,\\" in Susan Orlando (ed.) The Italian Viola Da Gamba: Proceedings of the International Symposium on the Italian Viola Da Gamba ; Magnano, Italy, 29 April ‚Äì 1 May 2000. Limoges: Presses Univ. Limoges. Thus, a visually spectacular three- manual harpsichord from Franciolini's shop was long a prominent item displayed in the musical instrument gallery of the Deutsches Museum in MunichThe instrument was listed in the description of the Museum's collections in Kottick and Lucktenberg (1993). but is no longer viewable. None of the 14 Franciolini-derived instruments in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York is on public view,Source: museum web site: . nor were (as of 2014) any of the 38 Franciolini items listed on the web site of the Stearns collection.This includes their fraudulent three-manual Franciolini harpsichord; see . Another option a museum can take to deal with its Franciolini instruments is to deaccession them; i.e. remove them from the collection. One example is a three-manual harpsichord that Franciolini sold in 1900 to the great collector Mary Elizabeth Brown, who installed it in her closely affiliated collection at the Metropolitan Museum.Mrs. Brown had already accumulated a collection of 280 instruments by 1889, which she donated to the Museum at that time. She continued to collect, donating each instrument in turn, until 1904. Source: Pollens (1995:88) According to Pollens, Mrs. Brown did better on another occasion (1894), when Franciolini attempted to sell her a fraudulent Cristofori piano, under circumstances which aroused her suspicions sufficiently to lead her to cancel the purchase. This harpsichord was rebuilt in Franciolini's workshop from a 1789 fortepiano by the Italian builder Vincenzio Sodi. The Metropolitan Museum sold it in 1983 to John Koster (a noted harpsichord scholar) and Jacqueline Block, who later donated it (2008) to the National Music Museum in Vermillion, South Dakota, where it resides today.Sources: Koster (1999), as well as the National Museum's web site: Scholars The musical instrument scholar Edwin Ripin helped to clean up the scholarly mess Franciolini created by publishing an edition of Franciolini's own sales catalogs (Ripin 1974, cited below). Brauchli (1998) writes that thanks to Ripin's research and publication,\\"most of the altered and fraudulent instruments in museums and collections throughout the world have now been identified.\\"Brauchli (1998:297) This may be optimistic; Kottick and Lucktenberg (1997)'s survey of musical instrument museums contains multiple references to instruments that are likely ‚Äì not certain ‚Äì to be Franciolini material. And even when an instrument is known to have passed through Franciolini's hands, doubt can remain about the degree of falsification it underwent. For instance, the following description appears on the web site of the Stearns Collection in Ann Arbor (catalogue #1333): > This harpsichord features an inscription of ‚ÄúChristoforus Rigunini, Firenze, > A.D. 1602,‚Äù which, if true, makes it one of the oldest keyboards in the > Stearns Collection. It comes to us, however, through the nefarious > instrument dealer, Leopoldo Franciolini. One could say that it is the only > surviving instrument ever crafted by the maker Rigunini, however, given that > not a single person by the name of Rigunini ever seems to have drawn breath, > we might assume that Franciolini invented the name and forged the date. When > John Koster examined the instrument in 2006, however, he wrote, ‚ÄúThe > original single-strung disposition, seldom made after the early seventeenth > century, would suggest a relatively early date for the instrument.‚ÄùSee . The Franciolini-altered instruments offer an interesting challenge and indeed enjoyment to modern scholars ‚Äì harpsichord expert Denzil Wraight has said that \\"unravelling the tangle of Franciolini forgeries provides some harmless amusement.\\" Wraight's remark comes from a scholarly article in which he reasons his way to the conclusion that the three-manual harpsichord in the Deutsches Museum, attributed by Franciolini to Bartolomeo Cristofori, was in fact originally a single-manual instrument built in 1658 by Girolamo Zenti.Denzil Wraight (1991) A Zenti harpsichord rediscovered. Early Music 191:99‚Äì102. The three-manual harpsichord in the National Music Museum (described above) was studied in detail by John Koster during the time it was in his possession. Koster's attribution of the instrument to Sodi was not difficult since Franciolini had neglected to obliterate the signature Sodi placed on a soundboard rib. Koster's scholarly paper on this instrument (1999) focuses instead on what knowledge can be retrieved about the original Sodi fortepiano from the converted harpsichord. Similar detective work has been carried out by Grant O'Brien on the three-manual Franciolini-altered Bolcioni instrument in the Russell Collection in Edinburgh, mentioned above.Grant O'Brien (2000) Towards establishing the original state of the three-manual harpsichord by Stefano Bolcioni, Florence, 1627, in the Russell Collection of Early Keyboard Instruments, Edinburgh. The Galpin Society Journal 53:168-200. Available on line at O'Brien's web site: . Dealers and auction houses A modern auction house that values its trustworthy reputation must sell an old Franciolini instrument with circumspection. Thus, when the Christie's auction house offered a theorbo tainted by a possible Franciolini provenance, it noted the Franciolini origin in all capitals on its website, and set the opening bid price very low (the final selling price was also low).Source: Christie's web site: Sotheby's, selling a Franciolini virginals, likewise provided ample warning and set a low estimated price.For the Sotheby's listing see . The instrument, portraying the Piazza del Duomo in Florence on its lid, appeared in Franciolini's sixth catalog with the date 1767 and an attribution to \\"Agostinus Federicius\\"; see Ripin (1974:69, 113).

The development of cliffside homes and exclusive bungalows was established in the 1920s by George Peck to attract people who wanted to live with a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean. Experts investigating the landslide said that the ground was shifting at a rate of 11 inches per day. The landslide occurred at the southern tip of San Pedro sending nearly 40,000 square feet of land into the Pacific Ocean. The first reports of damage occurred on January 2, 1929, a waterline broke underneath the Ocean View Inn hotel on Paseo Del Mar, and a few days later a gas line broke under the same building. Most of the houses on the 600 block of Paseo Del Mar were evacuated and relocated before the collapse. There was not enough time to move two houses, which ultimately slid into the ocean. Part of the adjoining Point Fermin Park also fell. The slide displaced houses, commercial buildings, streets, and sidewalks.  Geographical factors  The cliff which collapsed, pictured in 2003 On May 18, 1929 the Los Angeles Times reported the first geographical information about the landslide. It was reported that a crack ran from Point Fermin's inland sea cliffs for half of a block to the corner of Pacific Avenue and Paseo Del Mar. The crack caved in five acres and caused breaks in gas and water lines throughout the neighborhood. Waves undercutting the cliff caused water to seep into the bentonite layer of the cliff. Bentonite is a form of absorbent clay formed by the breakdown of volcanic ash. The ash layer became water logged, destabilizing the cliff. On the day of the initial slide, the Los Angeles Times reported a crack that resulted in a deep hole ten feet long and three feet across in front of one of the houses. In coastal California, landslides are common due to an active tectonic environment. Some geologists have identified the name for landslides that push land into the ocean as a \\"slump.\\" Landslides tend to be more common in places where rocks are weak and slopes are steep, which is how most of the coastal areas in Southern California are structured. The Paseo Del Mar neighborhood was a perfect example of this geographical issue. After the landslide disaster, geologists looked into the Fermin Point land structure and found very little record of geotechnical inspection or investigation. There were no geologic or soil reports regarding instabilities within the site, which means that no proper research was done to determine whether or not it was safe to build a community on the grounds. The steep cliffs and loose rocks are the reason that the Sunken City beach is fenced off from the public. The geographical composition of the land makes it unsafe and potentially hazardous to people's safety, even if people are experienced in hiking or other outdoor activities. The cliffs of the Sunken City Another aspect that makes Sunken City unsafe is that the land is continuing to move, although not as drastically as during the 1929 incident. In recent years multiple landslides have caused major cracks in adjacent highways. In 2011, a roadway crumbled into pieces then fell into gaping holes near the White Point Nature Preserve in San Pedro, and part of the roadway descended into the ocean. In Rancho Palos Verdes, an area about four miles up the coast from Sunken City beach, an estimated US$500,000 per year is spent in repairs to stabilize land that is constantly moving and dropping off into the ocean. The City of Los Angeles‚Äôs engineers and political representatives are conflicted about whether or not to spend public money to replace the part of Paseo Del Mar destroyed at Sunken City, or to leave it as a memorial of the disaster. In the years after landslide in 1929, Sunken City was abandoned and known only to locals. Sunken City‚Äôs street address is 500 W. Paseo Del Mar, San Pedro, CA, 90731. The area is fenced off and technically not open to the public. There have been at least eighteen deaths in the last five years at or near the cliffs of San Pedro and at Sunken City. In 2003, there were five cliffside deaths, two of which happened within a three-day span. In 2006, four people fell or threw themselves from the cliffs onto the rocks below and died. In January 2007, Mario Danelo, a kicker on the USC football team, fell over 100 feet from the cliffs to his death in San Pedro. In the same year, 19 year old, Megan Maynard, lost her footing on unstable rocks and plunged over 50 feet to her death at Sunken City. Three more people died in the same year from falls from the cliffs. Aside from deaths at Sunken City and areas near it, a number of injuries requiring hospitalization have resulted from trespassing past the gate and hiking the area. This is the reason Sunken City has not been opened to public access. Sunken City is one of the only landslide areas along the coastline of San Pedro that remains closed to the public. However, it is a hidden tourist attraction. Sunken City has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean and also the remains of concrete foundations, curbsides, sanitation, and piping from the neighborhood that once thrived on the San Pedro cliff. Illegal access is made through a small hole in the fence that separates the public from the hiking trail that leads to the attraction. It is also accessed by climbing the fence.  In popular culture  As the word about Sunken City spread, the beach began to gain a presence on social media and online websites. Sunken City beach has its own Facebook page where people form a sort of community of fans. The Facebook page has photos, information, maps, and videos of the beach shared by people enjoyed their experiences at Sunken City.https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sunken-City/134898709901733 The \\"sunkencity\\" hashtag on Instagram has over 19,000 tags. A 2012 movie Sunken City told the story of a San Pedro police officer assigned to an investigation at the site after a woman's dead body washes ashore. Sunken City also featured in the season finale of the series Fear The Walking Dead, and features in Melissa F. Olson's urban fantasy novel Shadow Hunt. Businesses in San Pedro have named their businesses after the beach because it has become a tourist attraction. The Sunken City is featured in Tim Power's 2020 novel Forced Perspectives, book two in the \\"Vickery and Castine Series.\\" Lastly, the critically acclaimed 1998 film The Big Lebowski filmed the scene of the scattering of Donny's ashes in The Sunken City.https://www.lamag.com/culturefiles/big-lebowski-locations-20-years/. lamag. retrieved 06/08/20.  Proposal for public access  In May 2015, fans of the off-limit beach conducted an online petition asking for the public opening of Sunken City. The petitioners asked for the opening of the beach during daylight hours and policing by night, adding lighting, cameras, and ticketing to maintain safety. Director Martin Scorsese has been a vocal advocate for opening the beach up to the public. San Pedro's City Councilman Joe Buscaino has put forward a proposition for opening the area for the public to enjoy without the risk of being fined by the police. Buscaino's proposal would involve keeping the large wrought iron fence. However, the proposal would require the park officials to install a gate in the fence that would mechanically close and bar off the area at sunset. Councilman Buscaino's argues that many other coastline areas are open to the public. The main concern against opening is potential liability for visitors' injuries. While Buscaino has been a vocal advocate, there is no set timeline. Furthermore, even though Buscaino's plan would keep the fence up, many argue that the fence serves no purpose, as they claim that today people who have an interest in exploring the area either crawl under the fence or simply walk down the cliff- side of the area to avoid the fence.  Past proposal for public access  The proposal to open Sunken City up to the public is not a new idea. In 1989 there was a plan to open up the surrounding area so that the community could have regulated recreational access through a developed nature trail. This plan was supposed to be enacted with the installment of the wrought iron fence that now restricts the area. The plan was proposed by then-City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, however, the design for adding the gates to the fence was never implemented. In addition, the original plans to open Sunken City to public recreational access seemed to have been lost and forgotten, but with the new proposal being presented by Joe Buscaino, the Coastal Commission has begun a search for the original proposal. Sunken City has largely become a tourist site attracting locals and visitors from as far away as Europe have come to catch a glimpse of the graveyard of a San Pedro neighborhood. Sunken City has become so popular in fact, that many of the residents of the Point Fermin area have demanded that the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks open the area, claiming that the Sunken City area has been stable for many years now. Even the head of the Sunken City Watch group has advocated for the area to be opened up to the public. Advocates sought a legal opinion, hiring the Hermosa Beach law firm of Chatten-Brown & Carstens LLP. It was determined that the city would face little to no liability if the area was open to access. Today, if caught trespassing, violators can face a hefty fine of up to a $1000.  Surrounding attractions  While Sunken City is one of the main attractions in San Pedro, nearby are other historic areas that also draw the public in. Within a short walk from the west of Sunken City is Point Fermin Park, which includes a large park of green meadows that lead to the Point Fermin Lighthouse. In addition, just north of the park is the Korean Friendship Bell, which was donated from Korea to the United States in 1976.  Incident reports  Graffiti at the site Sunken City has had a history of incidents occur both criminal and noncriminal. In 1986, there were various complaints and reports filed from local residents reporting people sneaking into the restricted area and having loud parties after hours. The residents also reported to police gang activity, including vandalizing and theft. In 1982, a teenager fell from the cliffs of Sunken City while trying to escape from the police who were rounding up trespassers within the area. This incident led to the replacement of the chain-linked fence with a more permanent wrought iron fence, installed in 1987. The expense for the new fence was more than US$200,000 and it was thought that it would finally solve the trespassing problems of the area. However, incidents continue to occur even with the sturdier fence in place. In 2013, a woman was found dead by the Sunken City area. That same year a 10-year-old girl suffered head injuries from falling off the cliff. In July 2015, a woman fell 20 feet from one of the cliffs and was injured.

Most notably Maxwell is the former lead singer of the swing revival band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He wrote the single \\"Hell\\" from the 1996 certified platinum album Hot. Early life Thomas Edward Maxwell was born to Joseph Maxwell and Nancy (Miller) Maxwell in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida in September 1965. In 1972 their family moved to Burnsville, North Carolina. In elementary school Maxwell began playing alto sax, and at the age of fourteen he taught himself to play the drums. When he was seventeen he left home to go to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he started his first band, Teasing the Korean, with fellow UNC classmate John Ensslin. In 1990, Teasing the Korean became What Peggy Wants, and they were signed to a local Chapel Hill label, Moist/Baited Breath. In December 1993, What Peggy Wants broke up. During his time in What Peggy Wants, Maxwell befriended Metal Flake Mother drummer Jimbo Mathus. In 1992, until Metal Flake Mother disbanded, Mathus became lead guitarist and Maxwell briefly joined as the band's drummer. In 1993, Mathus, along with Mathus' then girlfriend Katherine Whalen, Ken Mosher, Don Raleigh, and Chris Phillips, formed the neo-swing, pre-war jazz revival group Squirrel Nut Zippers. They played a couple of local shows and recorded a three-track EP on Merge Records, Roasted Right. In January 1994, Maxwell was asked to join the band. Squirrel Nut Zippers The band signed with Mammoth Records in the summer of 1994. They recorded their first record, The Inevitable, a few months later in Hillsborough, North Carolina. In the summer of 1995, Maxwell, Mosher, and Mathus took a trip to New Orleans, Louisiana to visit their friend, Blind Melon drummer Glen Graham. Graham had been recording Soup with Blind Melon at Daniel Lanois' Kingsway Studios earlier that year. In October 1995 the band went to New Orleans to record the Hot album at Kingsway Studios. They produced the record with the help of Mike Napolitano. They recorded Hot in six days, and the record was released in June 1996. The record went certified gold in May 1997, and by September of that year it was RIAA certified platinum, selling over 1.3 million copies. They had a hit with Maxwell's song \\"Hell\\", a single tone calypso about Hell. That year it charted at #13 on Billboard Hot 100. In 1999 Tom Maxwell and Ken Mosher left the band, due to a management agreement that the band had signed without their knowledge. The band refused to pay royalties to either of them, which led to a five-year legal battle. They settled out of court for $155,000, but the band breached the settlement and the two were only awarded a fraction of the money. This led to an irreparable relationship between Maxwell/Mosher and Mathus/Whalen. In late December 2015 Maxwell published a piece on Medium explaining why he will not be a part of the Squirrel Nut Zipper's tour in fall of 2016. The band plans to reissue Hot for its 20-year anniversary, for which 1/3 of the record's material was written by Maxwell and Mosher, including both singles which were penned by Maxwell. 2000‚Äìpresent In 1999 Maxwell recorded his first solo album, Samsara, at Kingsway Studios. He toured for the record with SNZ members Ken Mosher and Chris Phillips, along with Ben Folds Five bassist Robert Sledge. Through the legal turmoil with SNZ and the birth of his first child, Maxwell stopped touring in 2000, and did not tour again until 2015. For several years following their departure from the band, he worked with Ken Mosher, contributing songs and scores for films and television, including season 1 of Lovespring International and the animated film Happily N'ever After. In 2006, just days after he and his first wife separated, Maxwell's three-year-old son was diagnosed with leukemia. Maxwell retreated from his musical career and focused on shepherding his son through a three-and-a-half- year treatment. His son made a full recovery, and in 2009 Maxwell came back to music. In 2011 he released his first studio album in over a decade, Kingdom Come. In 2014 Maxwell released his first record with The Minor Drag, Tom Maxwell & The Minor Drag, produced by longtime producer Mike Napolitano. Tom also wrote a memoir titled Hell - My Life In The Squirrel Nut Zippers, in which he talks about his experience in the band, his time on the road, and the recording of the band's albums. Maxwell is a successful freelance writer. He has contributed to Al Jazeera America, as well as publications including Slate, Oxford American, Salon, Southern Cultures, and Bitter Southerner. Tom currently lives in New Orleans with his wife, musician Brooke Maxwell.

Singapore and Vietnam started the trade relations in the 19th century. Since the anti- communist policy of Singapore, Singapore supported South Vietnam before the unification of Vietnam. Singapore also started formal diplomatic relations with North Vietnam on August 1, 1973. After the unification of Vietnam, Singapore started to improve its relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The relations was worsened during the Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War, but it has now revived after the People's Army of Vietnam withdrawal from Cambodia. Singapore and Vietnam keep excellent and multifaceted bilateral relations, and both countries are the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). History Singapore started the trade relations with Vietnam in the 19th century, which some Vietnamese ships re-exported and sold products in Singapore. Ho Chi Minh, the first President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, lived in Singapore after being released by the Government of Hong Kong. Nonetheless, he was arrested by the Singapore Police Force in 1932 and was deported to Hong Kong. In December 1941, Japan attacked Singapore by using military bases in Vietnam, making the Japanese occupation of Singapore. After the Second World War, France used Singapore as a mediate to send troops and equipment to suppress the Vietnamese Independence Movement. In 1954, the Geneva Conference decided to divide Vietnam into two parts, which the northern part belongs to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or North Vietnam, led by the Communist Party of Vietnam, while the southern part belongs to the Republic of Vietnam, or South Vietnam, an anti-communist regime. In early days, Singapore implemented anti-communist policy, making the Government of Singapore supported South Vietnam. When Singapore gained independence from Malaysia in 1965, South Vietnam became one of the earliest Asian nations to recognize Singapore and established diplomatic relations with it. On August 1, 1973, Singapore established diplomatic relations with North Vietnam. In 1975, the Fall of Saigon marked the unification of Vietnam. Singapore started to improve its relations with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. In October 1978, Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, visited Singapore and became the first Prime Minister of Vietnam to visit Singapore after unification. In December 1978, Vietnam decided to send troops to Cambodia, led to the outbreak of Cambodian‚ÄìVietnamese War. Singapore supported anti-Vietnamese resistance in Cambodia and organized an international campaign to condemn Vietnam. Singapore also did not recognize the People's Republic of Kampuchea. The two nations' relations become normalized after Vietnamese troops retreated from Cambodia in 1990 and Vietnam joined the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in 1995. Leaders of Singapore and Vietnam met frequently. In 2004, Phan Van Khai, the Prime Minister of Vietnam visited Singapore and signed the Joint Statement on the Comprehensive Cooperation Framework in the 21st century. In 2013, Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, visited Vietnam and established Strategic Partnership relations with Vietnam. In 2015, Nguyen Tan Dung, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, visited Singapore twice for the funeral of Lee Kuan Yew, the former Minister Mentor of Singapore and the celebration activities of the 50th anniversary of Singapore. Trade relations According to the data from The Observatory of Economic Complexity, in the 1990s, the exported value from Singapore to Vietnam was about 1 million US dollars, and it increased to 8 billion US dollars in 2008. Although it fell afterwards, the exported value was still about 4 billion US dollars. Refined petroleum is the main product which Singapore exports to Vietnam. In the 1990s, the exported value from Vietnam to Singapore was about US$400 million. It increased to US$2.4 billion in 2008, then fell to US$1.6 billion in 2012, then it increased again in 2013. Crude oil is the main product which Vietnam exports to Singapore. On May 5, 1993, the Vietnam‚ÄìSingapore Cooperation Commission was established. On December 6, 2005, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Singapore and the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam signed Framework Cooperation on Vietnam‚ÄìSingapore Connectivity in Singapore including 6 aspects such as finance, investment, trade and services, transportation, information and telecommunication technology, education and training. The Framework Cooperation was effective on January 23, 2006. In 2014, Singapore was the third largest foreign investor in Vietnam, which totally invested 32.7 billion US dollars and contributed to 1,300 projects.

It is in a remote location at the headwaters of two streams with a wetland that contains rare plants and provides an unusual habitat for wildlife. The area is part of the Mountain Lake Wilderness Cluster. Location and access Hickory Flats is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 20 miles north of Pembroke, Virginia and 6 miles south of Waiteville, West Virginia. Peters Mountain forms the boundary to the northwest, and Big Stony Creek Rd (VA 635) on the southwest. There are gated forest roads and abandoned Jeep trails passing through the area. Good access is gained from State Route 613 (North Fork Mountain Road) that intersects State Route 635 (Big Stony Creek Road). Thick rhododendrons and bogs limit access to the wetlands. The Allegheny Trail passes along the north side of the area on Peters Mountain. Boundary of Hickory Flats as identified by the Wilderness SocietyThe boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. National Geographic Trail Map 788 gives the location of other trails and forest service roads. Additional foot access can be gained using old logging roads. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Hickory Flats wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Waiteville, and Interior. A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Natural history The habitat of the southern Appalachians is rich in its biological diversity with nearly 10,000 species, some not found anywhere else. The great diversity is related to the many ridges and valleys which form isolated communities in which species evolve separately from one another. The region lies south of the glaciers that covered North America 11,000 years go. To escape the glaciers, northern species retreated south to find refuge in the southern Appalachians. When the glaciers retreated, many of these species remained along with the southern species that were native to the area. The diversity includes trees, mosses, millipedes and salamanders. Red peat moss Unusual plants are the five- rowed peat moss, red peat moss and northern bog club moss. The five-rowed peat moss (Sphagnum quinquefanum) can be recognized by its rather short and stiff branches which appear angular because of the arrangement of its closely set leaves widely angled in 5 ranks.Daniels, R.E., Eddy, A. & Institute of Terrestrial Ecology 1985, Handbook of European Sphagna, Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Abbots Ripton. Red peat moss (Sphagnum rubellum) is a small reddish-coloured peat moss with tongue-shaped stem leaves. And northern bog club moss (Lycopodiella inundata) has branches up to 10 cm high with narrow, pointed leaves 4‚Äì8 mm long. Cerulean Warbler (male)Hickory Flats provides a secluded habitat for a population of black bear (Ursus americanus). Since bears are shy and secretive, they are rarely seen. When encountered, they will usually run away except in spring when females will protect their cubs, generally by sending them up a tree and returning later to gather them up. The area also provides habitat for ovenbirds, cerulean warblers, hooded warblers, pileated woodpeckers, eastern gray squirrel and eastern wild turkey. Johnson Flats, as well as the Peters Mountain summit, contain old growth forest. These areas serve as optimal habitat for a variety of species, particularly salamanders and other reptiles and amphibians. The valleys contain numerous beaver meadows. The area includes the upper watershed for both Stony Creek, which flows south into the New River, and Potts Creek, which flows north into the James River. The North Fork of Stony Creek has 259 acres designated as Mountains Wetland Rare Community. It includes 50 acres of the 250-acre North Fork Stony Creek Special Biological Area. Stony Creek is eligible for Recreational River status. The colorful candy darter is found in Stony Creek's rubble riffles with fast-flowing currents. The Stony Creek watershed on the west end of this area has been a hotspot for gypsy moth damage, with recurring infestations in various parts of the watershed and vicinity for many years. Gypsy moths have cyclical populations. After peaking in nearby Kelly Flats around 2005, populations crashed in 2009, but are expected to return. Topography Hickory Flats is in the Ridge and Valley Province of the Appalachian Mountains. The province consists of a thick layer of sedimentary rock that has undergone folding and/or faulting to create a series of ridges and valleys. During the sedimentation process fossils were formed leaving evidence of life existing millions of years ago. The fossils can be seen in rock exposures throughout the mountains. The topography is typical of the Central Appalachian Province, with long ridges dissected by steep draws and limited flat areas along streams. Elevations range between 2600 feet above sea level along Stony Creek and North Potts Creek to 3900 feet on the top of Fork Mountain and 4,000 feet on Peters Mountain on the north boundary of the area. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine their potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Hickory Flats was not included in the inventoried roadless areas, and therefore subject to possible road construction and timber sales. The Hickory Flats area is managed by the Forest Service to optimize the conditions for black bear habitat. The objectives are to provide a secluded and diverse habitat, ensure adequate den sites, and maintain hard and soft mast production. In June 2015, the Forest Service proposed a revegetation project to create early successional habitat by commercial timber regeneration harvests. The successional habitat will provide food as well as hiding and nesting cover for a variety of species. The project will also encourage the production of both early and hard mast production to provide food for wildlife. Several objections to the plan were submitted. The Sierra Club was concerned that the area contains substantial old growth forests, recognized conservations sites, and is at the headwaters of stream systems that proved habitat for the endangered candy darter and James River spinymussel. The final objections were published by the Forest Service on September 18, 2015. The project is now (December 18, 2015) under review by the Forest Service.

Orkin is an American physician, stem cell biologist and researcher in pediatric hematology-oncology. He is the David G. Nathan Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Orkin's research has focused on the genetic basis of blood disorders. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine, and an Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Early life Orkin grew up in Manhattan, where his father was a urologist. He studied biology as an undergraduate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned a medical degree from Harvard Medical School. He did postdoctoral research in molecular biology at the National Institutes of Health under geneticist Philip Leder. While Orkin was completing his training in hematology-oncology, his department chair, David G. Nathan, allowed him to establish his own research laboratory. Career Orkin is the David G. Nathan Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. He served as Chair of the Department of Pediatric Oncology at the Dana‚ÄìFarber/Harvard Cancer Center from 2000-2016. He has been on the Harvard Medical School faculty since the late 1970s and has been a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 1986. In the 1970s and 1980s, Orkin conducted research that identified genetic mutations associated with a group of blood disorders known as the thalassemias. This work led to the first comprehensive description of molecular defects in an inherited disorder. Later (1986), he and his team cloned a gene causing chronic granulomatous disease, marking the first time that a disease-causing gene was cloned without the researchers already knowing the protein coded by the gene. Today, his research lab examines transcriptional regulators of cell specification and differentiation. His laboratory cloned the first hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 (1989). Starting in 2008, Orkin and his colleagues published a series of papers identifying the critical role for BCL11A in the developmental switch from fetal type (HbF) to adult type (HbA) hemoglobin. His group demonstrated that loss of BCL11A alone is sufficient to rescue the phenotype of sickle cell disease (SCD). In September 2015, Orkin published a study in the journal Nature showing a small section of DNA which could be responsive to gene therapy for sickle-cell disease. Translation of the basic findings on the role of BCL11A in HbF silencing to the clinic is ongoing both with gene therapy and therapeutic gene editing. Honors and awards In 1987, Orkin received the E. Mead Johnson Award. Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1991, Orkin won the Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal from that organization in 2013. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 1992. In 1993, he received the Warren Alpert Foundation Prize. The American Society of Hematology named Orkin one of its Legends in Hematology in 2008. The American Society of Human Genetics honored Orkin with the 2014 William Allan Award, which recognizes sustained and significant contributions to human genetics. In 2017, he was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society, and in 2018 he received the George M. Kober Medal of the American Association of Physicians and the Mechthild Esser Nemmers Prize in Medical Science from Northwestern University. In 2020 he was awarded the King Faisal International Prize in Medicine.International King Faisal Prize 2020 and the Harrington Prize for Innovation in Medicine.

Biography He was born in Reggio Emilia to supportive parents, who fostered a broad classical education. He is said to have trained under Giuseppe Bazzani and Prospero Zanichelli in Reggio. He gravitated towards working in scenic design. In 1772 he decorated for the Melodrama Buffo by Niccol√≤ Piccinni titled L' Astratto or il Giuocatore fortunato. In May 1776, for a lavish court performance at Parma sponsored by Francesco III of Este, he decorated an Antonio Vivaldi opera, titled Motezuma where he painted the scenes for the two accompanying dances: La Principessa di Tingi and Tenis ed Amalsi. The first dance had scenes with *1. Great pavilion adorned with military trophies. *2. An army field with pavilions and a city distant. *3. Interior of a city with balconies draped with riched tapestries and spectators. *4. Gothic room. *5. Gothic cellar. *6. Military encampment. The second dance had scenes with *1. Country scene with altar. *2. Grotto. *3. Garden (Delizia) with statues and vases. From Reggio, he moved to Parma to decorate in 1782 the scenes of the melodrama theatrical work of Alessandro e Timoteo.Poetry by Count Castone della Torre di Rezzonico; Music by Giuseppe Sarti; and scene design by Pietro Gonzaga of Venice. He continued to work in Parmesan theaters for 15 years. Ercole III would in time raise him to the status of a Cavaliere. In 1785, he moved to Rome, and then, still as a scenic painter, traveled to Livorno, Barga, Pisa, Milan, Florence, Venice, Frankfort, and the Haymarket theater in London. He stayed in Venice for ten years. He was made a member of the Fine Arts academies of Modena, Parma, Venice, Florence, and Bologna. He died in 1795, leaving behind few permanent works. Among the works, both opera and dances, for which he provided designs in Parma are the following: *L' Astratto (1772) *Motezuma (1776) *Giulio Sabino (1784). *Il Trionfo di Alessandro (1784) *Medonte, re di Epiro (1785) *Vologeso Re de' Parti (1785) *Idalide (1786) *Calisto (1786) *Il Convalescente innamorato (1786) *Il Demofonte (1787) *Giasone e Medea (1787) *L' Inganno felice (1787) *Il Catone in Utica (1787) *L'Artaserse (1790) *La liberazione di Lilla (1790) *L'Innocenza riconosciuta (1790) *La morte di Cesare (1790) *Virginia (1790) *La vendetta di Nino (1793) *La Sultana in cimento (1793) *Il Servo raggiratore (1793) *Il Cajo Mario (1794) *La morte di Agamennone (1794) *Il Tamburo notturno, also called finta Statua del Marito (1794) *Il Conte di Saldagna (1795) *Le Feste d'Iside (1795) *La Bianca de' Rossi (1795) For the Theater in Reggio, he completed: *Il Barbiere di Siviglia (1788) *L'Impresario in angustie (1789) *Gli Amanti alla prova (1789) *Gli Sposi rapiti (1789) *La scuola de Pittori (1789) *L'Incredulo deluso (1791) *La bella Pesca trice (1791) *ll Capriccio Drammatico (1792) *I Zingari in Fiera (1792) *Don Giovanni Tenorio (1792) He was both a friend and competitor of the scenic designer Gonzaga.

Completed in 1908, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Background The first Phoenix public library opened in the spring of 1898 thanks to the efforts of the Friday Club, whose members collected books and secured two rooms on the second floor of the Fleming Block, one of the largest office buildings in downtown Phoenix. This venture was so well received that the following spring, the Phoenix Library Association was formed and the expanded library moved into a room in Phoenix City Hall which had been vacated by the legislative assembly, having moved to the new capitol building made the rooms available for other purposes. The books of the library were now for the first time catalogued by the Dewey system.Phoenix Carnegie Library and Library Park NRHP Nomination. 1974. The success of the library made necessary a more permanent and structured arrangement, and the Library Association consequently endeavored to transfer the project to the city. However, this could not be accomplished until March 1901 after an amendment to the territorial statutes. At this time, the Phoenix Public Library was established, with 1350 volumes. Since 1899 the Library Association had been unsuccessfully attempting to secure a grant from Andrew Carnegie, and in December 1901 the Phoenix Woman's Club joined the campaign. Some progress was made in March 1902 when the city agreed to put up the required 10% of the anticipated $25,000 grant and to levy an annual tax of 5 mills on the dollar. In June, the city agreed to furnish the site if the grant was received. Negotiations with Carnegie hit a snag when he saw the 1900 census report giving Phoenix a population of 5500, and decided that a grant of $15,000 would be sufficient. However, by the fall of 1903 a committee had gathered evidence to show that additions of land and population to Phoenix since 1900 had resulted in a population of 14,000. The committee also pointed out that the nearest public libraries were in Tucson and Prescott, leaving the entire Salt River Valley in need of this public service. Carnegie was convinced and agreed to the original sum of $25,000. Construction In July 1904, the city accepted this offer and set about selecting a suitable site. The first site chosen was on Central Avenue north of Van Buren Street, but the money for the lots had to be donated within 45 days and when this could not be accomplished, a second site was chosen. This site was known as Neahr's Park and covered two blocks on West Washington Street between 10th and 12th Avenues, halfway between the court house and the capitol. The land was donated to the city by Mr. Neahr. In the spring of 1905 the city approved the plans for the new building as drawn by Phoenix architect William R. Norton.Engineering Record 18 March 1905: 51. William H. Reeves, of Reeves & Baillie, Peoria, Illinois, revised the plans at the request of the city council. A board of trustees was appointed in August. By 1906, the project had been turned over to Millard & Creighton, and plans were approved in April.Engineering Record 21 April 1906: 54. Later history The red brick building was completed and opened for business on February 14, 1908 and continued in use as a library until the new main library was built in 1952. Since that time it has been used for various purposes, including a recreation hall, social service center, storage facility, and a homeless shelter. In 1984, the building was restored at a cost of $1.3 million, and the state leased it from the city in 1985. In 1987, the building was reopened as the Arizona Hall of Fame Museum. Due to safety concerns, it was closed in 2001. It reopened in 2003 and has since been used as administrative and museum space for the Arizona State Library.\\"The Carnegie Center\\". http://www.azlibrary.gov/.

In order to implement beamforming on digital hardware the received signals need to be discretized. This introduces quantization error, perturbing the array pattern. For this reason, the sample rate must be generally much greater than the Nyquist rate.Sonar Beamforming users.ece.utexas.edu. Retrieved November 12, 2015  Introduction  Beamforming aims to solve the problem of filtering signals coming from a certain direction as opposed to an omni-directional approach. Discrete-time beamforming is primarily of interest in the fields of seismology, acoustics, sonar and low frequency wireless communications. Antennas regularly make use of beamforming but it is mostly contained within the analog domain. Beamforming begins with an array of sensors to detect a 4-D signal (3 physical dimensions and time). A 4-D signal s(\\\\mathbf{x},t) exists in the spatial domain at position \\\\mathbf{x} and at time t. The 4-D Fourier transform of the signal yields S(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega) which exists in the wavenumber-frequency spectrum. The wavenumber vector \\\\mathbf{k} represents the 3-D spatial frequency and \\\\omega represents the temporal frequency. The 4-D sinusoid e^{j(\\\\omega t - \\\\mathbf{k}' \\\\mathbf{x})}, where \\\\mathbf{k}' denotes the transpose of the vector \\\\mathbf{k}, can be rewritten as e^{j \\\\omega(t - \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha}' \\\\mathbf{x})} where \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha} = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{k}}{\\\\omega} , also known as the slowness vector. Steering the beam in a particular direction requires that all the sensors add in phase to the particular direction of interest. In order for each sensor to add in phase, each sensor will have a respective delay \\\\tau such that \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau_i} = -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_o}' \\\\mathbf{x_i} is the delay of the ith sensor at position \\\\mathbf{x_i} and where the direction of the slowness vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_o} is the direction of interest.  Discrete-time weighted delay-and-sum beamforming  The discrete-time beamformer output bf(nT) is formed by sampling the receiver signal r_i(t) and averaging its weighted and delayed versions. bf(nT) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i r_i (nT - n_iT) where: * N is the number of sensors * w_i are the weights * T is the sampling period * n_i T is the steering delay for the ith sensor Setting n_i T equal to -\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_o}' \\\\mathbf{x_i} would achieve the proper direction but n_i must be an integer. In most cases n_i will need to be quantized and errors will be introduced. The quantization errors can be described as \\\\Delta \\\\tau_i = n_i T - \\\\tau_i. The array pattern for a desired direction given by the slowness vector \\\\alpha_o and for a quantization error \\\\Delta \\\\tau_i becomes: H(\\\\mathbf{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i e^{ -j(\\\\mathbf{k} - \\\\omega \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\alpha_0})' \\\\mathbf{x_i}} e^{ -j \\\\omega \\\\Delta \\\\tau_i }  InterpolationD. Dudgeon and R. Mersereau, Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing, Prentice-Hall, First Edition, pp. 307 - 309, 1983.  Flowchart of upsample and linear filter for discrete-time beamforming The fundamental problem of discrete weighted delay-and-sum beamforming is quantization of the steering delay. The interpolation method aims to solve this problem by upsampling the receiving signal. n_i must still be an integer but it now has a finer control.

The samples \\\\tilde{r}_i(m\\\\tilde{T}) are interpolated from r_i(nT) such that \\\\tilde{r}_i(m\\\\tilde{T}) = \\\\sum_n r_i(nT)g((m - nI)\\\\tilde{T}) After bf(n\\\\tilde{T}) is upsampled and filtered, the beamformer output bf(m\\\\tilde{T}) becomes: bf(m\\\\tilde{T}) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i \\\\sum_p r_i(pT) g((m- pI - n_i) \\\\tilde{T}) At this point the beamformer's sample rate is greater than the highest frequency it contains.  Frequency- domain beamformingD. Dudgeon and R. Mersereau, Multidimensional Digital Signal Processing, Prentice-Hall, First Edition, pp. 309 - 311, 1983.  As seen in the discrete-time domain beamforming section, the weighted delay-and-sum method is effective and compact. Unfortunately quantization errors can perturb the array pattern enough to cause complications. The interpolation technique reduces the array pattern perturbations at the cost of a higher sampling rate and more computations on digital hardware. Frequency-domain beamforming does not require a higher sampling rate which makes the method more computationally efficient.http://hdl.handle.net/10919/27765 The discrete-time frequency-domain beamformer is given by fd(nT,\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}w_i R_i(nT,\\\\omega)e^ {j\\\\omega(n-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_i)} For linearly spaced sensor arrays \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_i = - \\\\frac{Mq}{Nl} i. The discrete short-time Fourier transform of r_i(nT) is denoted by R_i(nT,\\\\omega). In order to be computationally efficient it is desirable to evaluate the sum in as few calculations as possible. For simplicity T = 1 moving forward. An effective method exists by considering a 1-D FFT for many values of \\\\omega. If \\\\omega = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi l}{M} for 0 \\\\le l < M then R_i(n,\\\\omega)e^ {j\\\\omega(n-\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\tau}_i)} becomes: R_i \\\\left( n, \\\\frac{2\\\\pi l}{M} \\\\right) e^{j \\\\frac{2\\\\pi l}{M} n } = \\\\sum_{p=0}^{M-1} r_i(n - p)v(p) e^{j \\\\frac{2\\\\pi l}{M} p} where p = n-m.

Built in 1914, it is significant as the home from 1915 to 1950 as the home of Dr. Bob Smith (\\"Dr. Bob\\"), one of the cofounders of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). It was here that Smith and Bill W. began the meetings that became AA, through which Smith achieved sobriety. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2012. It is now owned by Founders Foundation, and is operated by them as a museum dedicated to the history of AA. Description and history The Dr. Robert Smith House is located in a residential area northwest of downtown Akron, at the northwest corner of Ardmore and Everett Avenues. It is a 2-1/2 wood frame structure, with Craftsman/Bungalow styling. It has a side gable roof with extended eaves showing exposed rafters, and its front face is pierced by a pair of gabled dormers. A single-story porch extends across the front, supported by brick piers and topped by a broad gabled roof. The interior has been restored to a 1930s-1940s appearance, retaining a number of features important in the history of Dr. Bob Smith's alcoholism and recovery, such as hiding places where he stashed liquor. One of the upstairs bedrooms is known as the \\"Surrender Room\\", and is where even today recovering alcoholics surrender themselves to a Higher Power according to AA's tenets. The house was built in 1914, and purchased in 1915 by Robert and Anna Smith. Smith was a medical doctor who struggled since his college days with alcoholism. In 1935, Bill W. spent several months living with the Smiths, and it is probably around the house's kitchen table that the principles underlying Alcoholics Anonymous were developed. The house was sold after Bob Smith died in 1950, and passed through several owners before its purchase in 1984 by the Founders Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving the AA history and legacy.

It was released by Roadrunner Records under licence, but without the permission of the band, and as such has a controversial entry into the band's catalogue. Lemmy didn't collaborate with the album until 2005 on its Sanctuary reissue.  Recording  The band originally meant to use this concert for what became 1988's N√∂ Sleep at All live album, but because this material 'went missing' for some years, they couldn't, and the Finnish concert of some 6 months later at the Giants of Rock Festival was used instead. This concert was available as a bootleg for many years, before finally seeing a licensed release under the Dutch label Roadrunner in 1994, but the sound quality is still very poor for a 'produced' live album. It was not mastered very well from the original tapes, and the reissued Sanctuary release of 2005 does not appear to have had a remaster either. The concert itself is more of a testament to 1986s Orgasmatron and 1987s Rock 'N' Roll album, as most of these songs never got played again live after this tour ended in 1988, until 2004 for one or two.  Release  Originally released in 1994 as Live at Brixton but renamed Live at Brixton '87 in 2005 when reissued by Sanctuary. Some of the tracks are staples but the majority are tracks not played by the band since this tour. \\"Doctor Rock\\", from the previous studio album Orgasmatron, and \\"Just 'Cos You Got the Power\\" from the Eat the Rich single, wouldn't be heard from again until the 2004 DVD, Stage Fright. \\"Stay Clean\\", \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Ace of Spades\\" have only been missing on two official live albums, Live in Toronto in 1982 with Eddie Clarke and the widely bootlegged Live in Manchester in 1983 with Brian Robertson on guitar, released officially in 2005 as a bonus disk on Another Perfect Day remaster, so their inclusion is not surprising. \\"Deaf Forever\\" and \\"Built for Speed\\" from Orgasmatron; \\"Eat the Rich\\", \\"Stone Deaf in the U.S.A.\\", \\"Traitor\\" and \\"Dogs\\" from Rock 'N' Roll; all only saw live performances during the 1986-88 tour/s as by the nineties had been dropped completely from the live set, even for random gigs. This is the only official live recording of the song \\"Rock 'N' Roll\\" to be released by the band. Notably missing from this set are \\"No Class\\", \\"Orgasmatron\\", \\"Mot√∂rhead\\", \\"Killed by Death\\" and \\"Overkill\\", all of which were played at the concert but missing from this release and its predecessor, though there is a Japanese bootleg with the complete concert in circulation.

In a largely male-dominated medium, Aiko is an influential figure in contemporary street art. She is known for her ability to combine western art movements and eastern technical, artistic skills, as well as for her large-scale works installed in cities including Rome, Italy, Shanghai, China and Brooklyn, New York. Aiko's work is inspired by 18th- century Japanese woodblock printing and has been described as \\"joyfully, subversively feminine.\\" Her artwork on canvas uses a bricolage technique, incorporating spray paint, stenciling, brushwork, collage, and serigraphs. She is inspired by New York neighborhoods and advertising, drawing from imagery from Chinatown and Times Square in the form of old signs, billboards, and neon signs. Aiko is heavily inspired by her Japanese identity, and experiences as a Japanese woman. Through her graffiti and street art, she gives visibility and representation to women and girls, as well as addressing gender inequality and other issues they may face in the world. Aiko enjoys creating art that is beautiful, full of love, and can be shared with anyone. The imagery in her work is often linked to romance, sexuality, and promiscuity while also appreciating and praising the female form. Aiko fully embraces the process of creating her work, and thrives off of the freedom, spontaneity, and challenges that come with using the street as your canvas and gallery space. The focus on process is seen in her work through the prominent layering of colors and stenciled shapes, reminiscent of screen printing or wood block prints that come together to create her large female figures. Biography spray paint by Aiko Nakagawa (AIKO) Aiko Nakagawa was born in 1975 and raised in the central area of Tokyo. She attended an all-girl high school. While she was in college in Tokyo, she created a pirate television station that broadcast her own music videos and short films. The broadcast could be picked up within a three-kilometer radius and generated some local press coverage before the government sent her a letter ordering her to desist. In the mid-1990s, she moved to New York City where she apprenticed in artist Takashi Murakami's Brooklyn studio. Her and Muramaki's work are similar by their incorporation of Japanese culture, and have even worked with high-end fashion designer, Louis Vuitton. She studied media studies at the New School University and wheat pasted naked images of herself around the city. Towards the end of the 1990s Aiko collaborated with artists Patrick McNeil and Patrick Miller. The three formed the street art collective FAILE (then A-life) in 1998. Together the artists created \\"large format, monochromatic, screen-printed female nudes,\\" among other work. They collective became very popular through this style which worked similarly across media from posters, to prints, to gallery works on canvas. In 2006, Lady Aiko left the collective. In 2005 she collaborated with fellow street artist Banksy for his film Exit Through the Gift Shop. Aiko's work was included in the Museum of Sex's erotic street art exhibition in 2012. Later that year she created the mural Here's Fun for Everyone on New York City's Bowery Wall. She was the first woman artist to be invited to paint the wall./ In 2013, she attended the international street art festival Nuart in Stavanger, Norway, alongside fellow female graffiti artists Martha Cooper and Faith 47. Working on two walls of a tunnel below the Tou Scene arts centre, she created a work with stenciled representations of silhouettes, women, angels, Mount Fuji, butterflies, flowers and a rabbit holding an aerosol paint can to represent female energy. The same year she designed a characteristic floral and feminine scarf for luxury brand Louis Vuitton alongside other street artists Retna and Os Gemeos  Solo Projects  # 2015 EDO CITY GIRL at Ink_d Gallery - Brighton, UK # 2015 LADY BUTTERFLY Limited Edition Sculpture/ Pink # 2014 SWEETHEART at The Outsiders Gallery - Newcastle, UK # 2014 AIKO's Bunny Party at Gallery Brooklyn - Brooklyn, NY # 2014 AIOK x ISETAN Window Display Project - ISETAN Tokyo, Japan # 2013 LADY BUTTERFLY Limited Edition/ Pearl White # 2013 FOULARDS D'ARTISTES, AIKO x Louis Vuitton # 2012 The Bowery Wall - NYC # 2012 LADY BUTTERFLY Limited Edition Sculpture/ Cherry # 2012 AFTER A LONG TIME Exhibition at Merry Karnowsky Gallery - LA # 2011 UNSTOPPABLE WAVES LONDON Exhibition at PURE EVIL Gallery - London, UK # 2011 UNSTOPPABLE WAVES Exhibition at Andenken Gallery - Amsterdam, The Netherlands # 2011 LADY BUTTERFLY Limited Edition Sculpture/ Black and Silver # 2010 HERE'S FUN FOR EVERYONE Exhibition at Andrew James Art - Shanghai, China # 2010 The Standard Stairwell Project at the Standard - NY and Hollywood LA # 2009 LOVE MONSTER Exhibition at Joshua Liner Gallery - Chealsea, NY # 2008 SHUT UP and LOOK Exhibition at Brooklynite Gallery - Brooklyn, NY # 2008 Aiko \\"Lady Kill\\" and \\"Vandarismo\\" print release with POW - London, England # 2008 AIKO BUNNY - KID ROBOT Limited Edition Vinyl Figure Street Art by Aiko Nakagawa (AIKO), characteristic of her erotic, feminine style ReferencesExternal links *Official website *Instagram of Lady Aiko 1975 births Living people Japanese graffiti artists People from Tokyo Women graffiti artists Women muralists ","title":"Lady Aiko"},{"id":"48531113","text":"Javier Mu√±oz may refer to: *Javier Mu√±oz (Spanish footballer) (born 1995), Spanish footballer for Real Madrid Castilla *Javier Mu√±oz (Argentine footballer) (born 1980), Argentine footballer for Chiapas F.C. *Javier Mu√±oz (actor) (born 1975), American stage actor ","title":"Javier Mu√±oz"},{"id":"48531129","text":"Ganga Devi is an Indian politician belonging to the Indian National Congress.

The line opened from Riverton to Clare on 5 July 1918, being extended to Spalding on 9 January 1922. The cessation of railway services was a consequence of the Ash Wednesday bushfires in February 1983, which caused major damage to infrastructure between Sevenhill and Penwortham. The line was formally closed on 17 April 1984. Campaign for the railway It was a railway that had been mooted in the 1860s, but was deemed to be too costly on account of the hilly nature of the Clare region. In 1870 railways were constructed to the east Burra, and the west (Hoyleton) of the Clare region. In 1875 a Railway Commission was established to recommend appropriate expansion of the South Australian railway network, but recommended against a branch line to Clare because no point in the region was more than from a railway station. The communities of Clare, Watervale and Auburn continued to agitate for the railway. At the start of the 1910s, their cause was championed by Sir Richard Butler, who had briefly been South Australian Premier, and was then Commissioner of Public Works in Archibald Peake's administration. A Royal Commission examined the proposal and determined that a branch-line to Clare would not generate revenue sufficient to cover costs, but extending the line further north towards Spalding would facilitate closer settlement of the pastoral estates, which would in turn generate more revenue. The Riverton to Spalding Railway Act was passed in 1913. Construction The line was built with economies that doomed it to inefficient operation. There were tight curves ( radius north of Clare), 1:60 grades, second-hand rails, and reinforced concrete bridges that were designed for light axle loading. When larger locomotives were introduced on the South Australian Railways in 1926, the Spalding line was unable to carry their greater weight. The motive power up to 1950 was mainly Rx class engines, with the occasional Q class and S class. Commencing early 1951, the line was worked mainly by 750 class locomotives. From 1960 the line was worked by 830 class diesel-electric locomotives. There was a major bridge over the Broughton River, just south of Spalding. It still stands, and in 1993 it was heritageSouth Australia Heritage Places database State Heritage Id 14607 listed. That listing was a consequence of the inclusion of the bridge in the 1985 book by Colin O'Connor \\"Spanning Two Centuries - Historic Bridges of Australia\\". O'Connor's book contains inaccuracies in relation to this bridge. It attributes its design to Alexander Moncrieff, but the contract drawingSAR Contract No. 23/1918 Drawing No. 33378/411/46 is signed by Alex's brother Joseph. When the bridge was designed, Alex Moncrieff had not worked for the South Australian Railways for two years. Its 5-arch design was, by engineering standards, more than a decade obsolete when the contract was signed in 1918. Australia's expert on ferro-concrete construction, John Monash, had abandoned that style of bridge by 1906. When the Broughton River bridge was completed in 1919 there was a dispute over payments to the contractor, Joseph Dixon. The matter went to the High Court of Australia, which was critical of Joseph Moncrieff's handling of the contract, yet by a majority the High Court found in favour of the South Australian Railways. Safeworking From 1918 to 1922, the safeworking system was the telephone block. With the opening of the line to Spalding in 1922, the line was worked under permissive block conditions. From January 1944 the line was worked by the train order system, operated by Train Control in Adelaide. Rail services In 1924 the South Australian Railways began using Model 55 Brill petrol railcars to provide passenger services on rural branch-lines, with Clare being the first destination, commencing on 24 February. Two days earlier, South Australian Premier Sir Henry Barwell hosted a group of officials and members of parliament on a demonstration run to Clare. By the end of 1924, the new railcars had become known in popular parlance as \\"Barwell Bulls\\", which was a term coined by one of Barwell's political opponents, with reference to the penetrating bovine sound of the railcar's air-horn. In 1927 the larger Model 75 Brill railcars operated the passenger service, and continued until 1954. On 24 May 1954, the railcar service was replaced by a co-ordinated road-bus service serving Jamestown and the towns along the Spalding railway line, to connect with trains at Riverton. The main source of outward freight on the line was bulk grain railed from Andrews. However, the rail-haul distance for transporting the grain to the terminal at Port Adelaide was considerably longer than the distance by road haulage to Wallaroo. During the 1970s there was a marked drop in the tonnage of grain railed from Andrews. Spalding became an unattended station in January 1975, and then in July 1978, soon after Australian National Railways took over South Australian country operations, Andrews became the effective terminus, because Spalding was deleted from the Working timetable. The track was lifted in 1989. The Riesling Trail In October 1992 the Clare Valley Winemakers Association held a Creative Think Day intended to find a way to distinguish the region's Riesling wine. Tony Brady of Wendouree Cellars suggested a trail be built using the old railway formation, and that it be called the Riesling Trail. He was supported by Evan Hiscock of Petaluma Wines. The proposal gained support from Terry Lavender of the State's Office of Recreation and Sport. In May 1994, two trial sections of The Riesling Trail were officially opened - Sevenhill to Watervale, and Riverton to Rhynie. The Clare Valley Winemakers Association continued to drive development of the Trail, and the section between Clare and Auburn was officially launched on 7 November 1998. In 1999 a community management committee was established. The section from Riverton through Rhynie to Auburn was subsequently redeveloped as the Rattler Rail Trail and opened in 2010. The original section from Auburn through the Clare Valley to Clare and beyond was extended northwards to the former Barinia siding, and was opened in November 2009. A committee in Clare is organising events and displays to mark the centenary of the official ceremony of the opening of the railway to Clare, performed by His Excellency, the Governor, Sir Henry Galway, on 4 July 1918. A book on the history of the railway is being prepared, and is planned to be released in time for the centenary.

The band is composed of Matt Scottoline (vocals, guitar), Joe DeCarolis (bass), and Rob DeCarolis (drums). History Hurry began as a solo project for principal songwriter Matt Scottoline, bassist of emo revival band Everyone Everywhere. He wrote the first ten to twenty Hurry songs as a way to write his own material and play guitar rather than bass. Scottoline decided to release his home recordings on Bandcamp under the moniker \\"Hurry,\\" chosen as a self- deprecating joke about his writing process; he writes quickly and rarely finishes a song if it is not completed in a single session. After releasing the demos, Scottoline recruited other musicians to perform the songs live, including Everyone Everywhere guitarist Brendan McHugh and Univox bassist Rob DeCarolis on drums. As Everyone Everywhere became less active, Hurry coalesced into a trio, adding DeCarolis's cousin and Psychic Teens/Exmaid bassist Joe DeCarolis to round out the lineup. The band signed to Hot Green Records and announced their first album, Everything/Nothing, which was recorded at The Headroom by labelmate Joe Reinhart of Hop Along. The record was preceded by its first single, \\"Oh Whitney,\\" as a limited cassette release. Its accompanying music video features the band attempting to set a world record for fireworks launched off a guitar, though the record-setting display is blocked by Rob DeCarolis standing in front of the camera. Though the explosive effects were added in post-production, the fireworks were live and caused some anxiety during filming. The band later released a video for \\"Oozing Positivity\\" to coincide with Everything/Nothing's cassette release; the video took director Dave Peterson six months to make and depicts the band as \\"delightfully retro\\" CGI characters. Hurry announced their third record Guided Meditation in March 2016 and was released on April 29, 2016 by Lame-O Records. It was recorded at Noisy Little Critter with Mike Bardzik. Prior to release, Scottoline said Guided Meditation will be \\"more confident\\" and \\"not [hide] behind noise as much\\". Their fourth record, Every Little Thought, was announced in January 2017 and was released on February 23. Musical style Hurry's sound has been described as power pop, fuzz or noise pop, indie pop, alternative rock and garage rock. They are often cited as early-90s rock revivalists; their influences include Weezer, Teenage Fanclub, Guided by Voices and Dinosaur Jr., though their influences also include older artists such as The Beach Boys and Paul McCartney and peers such as Yuck and Pure X. Yo La Tengo has been cited as a major influence; Scottoline has said their music showed him how an upbeat pop song could be \\"drenched in noise,\\" which he cites as an important touchstone for Hurry's music. In a separate interview, he said Hurry is \\"better when [they're] loud.\\" In popular culture The song \\"When I'm With You\\" was featured in the episode \\"Bagel\\" of the FXX series Man Seeking Woman.

It was first published in Scribner's Magazine in 1902, and was later collected in Traffics and Discoveries. The sister-poem accompanying it, Butterflies or Kaspar's Song in Varda, Kipling claimed to have been a translation of an old Swedish poem (from the Swedish of Stagnelius), although this claim is unsubstantiated. Plot The narrator (Kipling) is visiting a chemist friend who is experimenting with short-wave radio. He is attempting to make contact with another enthusiast, several miles distant. They are passing a restless night, concocting the most marvelous cocktails from the chemicals at hand, and the narrator succeeds in drugging Mr Shaynor, the chemist‚Äôs assistant, who is suffering from last stage consumption. \\"Again he sought inspiration from the advertisement\\" Shaynor has all the night been expressing his approval of a certain young lady in a toilet-water advertisement, and as he slips into a trance, he begins to indite poetry towards her. To the narrator's surprise, he begins to compose a poem of Keats; instead of merely writing the lines, he is in all the agonies of composition, and occasionally, in Kipling's opinion, improving on the poet's own work. The poem is The Eve of St. Agnes; in one instance Shaynor takes the \\"trite\\" line ::::::And threw warm gules on Madeline‚Äôs fair breast (line 218) and changes it to ::::::And threw warm gules on Madeline‚Äôs young breast which Kipling considers a change for the better. It seems to him that by the atmosphere auspicious for radio contact, Shaynor has somehow managed to connect with Keats, and the lines he writes are \\"the raw material...whence Keats wove the twenty-sixth, seventh, and eighth stanzas of his poem.\\" Criticism Some were critical of the story, saying it was \\"too full of crowded detail which, as it is structural, cannot be eliminated.\\"  References  1902 short stories Short stories by Rudyard Kipling Works originally published in Scribner's Magazine ","title":"Wireless (short story)"},{"id":"48531285","text":"Ram Lal Kureel was an Indian politician.

Abegg Jr. (born 1950) is a notable Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, researcher, and professor. Abegg is responsible for reconstructing the full text of the Dead Sea Scrolls from the Dead Sea Scrolls concordance, a project that broke the lengthy publication monopoly held on the scrolls. He went on to co-direct the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute at Trinity Western University from 1995 to 2015. Here, Abegg held the Ben Zion Wacholder Professorship. Because Abegg is an influential Dead Sea Scrolls scholar, he has been honoured with a collection of essays written by his peers and students. Apart from his career, Abegg's interests include hiking, playing the guitar, and good books and music. He met his wife Susan while hiking in Washington's Olympic Mountains in 1974, they married in 1975, and a decade of farm life and summers mountaineering before deciding to start a family; they had two daughters Steph and Jenny. Abegg currently resides in Chilliwack, British Columbia with his wife, Susan, and two cats Gram and Emmylou.  Early life  Martin Abegg is the son of Barbara and Martin (Jerry) Abegg. He was born in Peoria, Illinois. His mother was a housewife and part-time PE instructor while his father was a college professor, professional engineer and President of Bradley University.  Education  Abegg graduated from Bradley University in 1972 with a bachelor of science in Geology. After teaching Sunday school inspired him to take language classes, he received a MDiv degree from Northwest Baptist Seminary in 1983. Later, in 1984, Abegg went on to perform graduate work at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Career  Abegg spent two years teaching Hebrew at the Northwest Baptist Seminary. He also spent one year as a pastor. Abegg taught for three years at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana. After this, he moved to British Columbia, where he became a professor of Dead Sea Scrolls Studies at Trinity Western University in Langley. Here, he became co-director of the Dead Sea Scrolls Institute alongside Peter Flint.  Dead Sea Scrolls  Abegg first became acquainted with the Dead Sea Scrolls during his graduate work at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. In 1987 he returned to the states, and completed his dissertation at the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati on the War Scroll from Qumran Cave 1. During his time at the Hebrew Union College, Abegg began to collaborate with Professor Ben Zion Wacholder. John Strugnell, chief editor of the scrolls, had sent Wacholder a copy of the secret concordance of the Dead Sea Scrolls the editors were using at the time. Using this concordance, Abegg created a computerized database for the Dead Sea Scrolls texts. Abegg decided to publish this material while he was completing his dissertation.Hebrew Union College and the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jason Kalman Though this made Dead Sea Scrolls studies more convenient, Abegg was met with fury. Many influential scholars had been kept away from the materials while the editorial team worked on their first edition of scroll translation. Those who had the privilege of working with the scrolls were angry that their work had been undermined. However, Abegg's publication broke a forty-year monopoly on the scrolls, allowing scholars of all kinds access to examine the artifacts. Furthermore, Abegg's work on the concordance gave him the opportunity to create computer research tools in association with Accordance Bible Software for Dead Sea Scrolls research. Essentially, Abegg's work accelerated Dead Sea Scrolls research.

The species is found primarily on pineapple and other species in the genus Ananas, but also infests citrus trees, cotton, banana, coffee and other plants. Characteristics The adult Dysmicoccus brevipes has a pink to pink-orange coloured body. The body's shape varies from round till oval and is between 2.3 and 3.0 millimetres long. There are seventeen pairs of wax-producing glands which produce short wax filaments which conceal the body. The larvae are flattened and have long hairs. Ecology The species is ovoviviparous, and the female gives birth to live young, typically two or three hundred, after which she dies. The first stage larvae are known as \\"crawlers\\" and disperse, sometimes being conveyed by the wind to new host plants. The larval stage is variable but lasts for about five weeks. The only larval stages that feed are the first and the beginning of the second instar stage. After the third moult, the larva becomes mature, and the total lifespan averages 95 days. Distribution Dysmicoccus brevipes can be found in a wide variety of regions. It has been found in Hawaii, the Pacific, Central and South America, Australia and Africa.

In addition to evangelical motives, he focused especially on sustainability and collaboration with local groups, a concept not to be widely considered until decades later.  Early life and education  Phillips Foster Greene was born to Sarah Foster and Rev. Frederick Davis Greene in 1892 in Van, Turkey. His parents were missionaries there under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions when Greene was born, but evacuated two years later due to violence toward Americans in Turkey.Montague, William Lewis. \\"Full Text of \\"Biographical Record of the Alumni of Amherst College ... 1821-[1896]\\"\\" Full Text of \\"Biographical Record of the Alumni of Amherst College ... 1821-[1896]\\" N.p., n.d.

Phillips Greene's paternal grandparents were also well-known missionaries. Notably, Greene's grandfather, Joseph Kingsbury Greene, wrote Leavening the Levant in 1916.Greene, Joseph K. Leavening the levant. Pilgrim Press, 1916. Phillips Greene and his three younger brothers, Joseph, Edward, and David, were raised in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, under significant Christian and missionary influence. Greene attended Amherst College and received his B.A in 1915. He went on to study at Harvard Medical School,and earned a medical degree in 1919. While at Harvard he became a Student Volunteer for Foreign Missions, during which time he met Ruth Altman Greene, whom he would later marry.Greene, Ruth Altman. Hsiang-Ya Journal. Hamden, CT: Archon, 1977. Print.  Career = Transition from Turkey  While living in Constantinople, Turkey on the commission of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions political unrest made medical work in Turkey impossible for Greene. Following the Allied Peace Terms of World War I, Turkish authorities aimed to minimize foreign influence; American doctors were no longer welcome. The hospital in Anatolia, to which Greene had been assigned, was closed. Greene and his wife lived in Turkey from 1921-1923. Location of Changsha, Hunan province, China  Work in China  Greene soon accepted a position as teaching Staff at Hsiang-Ya Medical School, Changsha, China in 1923, where he remained until 1927.\\"Doctor from China to Teach Actual War Surgery Here.\\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle 12 Dec. 1943: 11. Print. In an early letter home, Greene described this assignment as an opportunity \\"to give good medical training with Christian character while the profession in China is still young,\\" and added that \\"great things are at stake\\" in his work there. At this time local warlords, in the name of the conservative North or the revolutionary South, were battling for power in China, a new republic. Greene and his wife were caught in the crossfire of this struggle as they first arrived in the province of Hunan. The Greenes lived in the Yale-in-China campus, just north of Changsha. In their first year of medical work at Hsiang- Ya, Greene noted the challenge in interacting with the local staff. He was also met with opposition from Changsha townspeople who thought the foreigner to be a bad omen, a possible cause of the flooding and the Cholera outbreak that were affecting their town. Due to a new policy of aiding only Chinese- administered programs, the Rockefeller Foundation withdrew funding from Greene's medical work, and the Hsiang-Ya hospital was closed for the summer of 1924. Changsha - Yale-in-China's Dormitory and tennis court In fall 1924 the Hsiang-Ya Medical School and hospital re-opened. Greene and his colleagues pushed for an increased focus on collaboration with Chinese doctors. Further opposition to foreign influence by Chinese Nationalists and Communists caused Hsiang-Ya students to strike. This led Greene to further revise his staffing: he wrote, \\"The medical school will be reorganized with only such foreign personnel as are necessary for the efficient running of the hospital.\\" Through their efforts, the Governing Board of the Medical School was eventually fully Chinese. By the spring of 1925, anti-foreign and anti-religious sentiment had begun to cause fighting and rioting in Changsha and across China, and Greene relocated temporarily with his family to Kuling (now Lushan, China) to study the Chinese language for the summer. At this time, many established missionaries to China were evacuating permanently, but Greene soon returned to work in the hospital despite threats to his life. In the fall of 1925, a northern province's drought and famine caused refugees to inundate Changsha and Greene's hospital, which was followed by an epidemic of Cholera. 1926 brought heightened conflict between China's regional warlords, and an influx of battle-wounded patients to the Hsiang-ya Hospital. The Rockefeller Foundation renewed grants for Greene's work, including additions to the hospital and medical school. However, many Hsiang-Ya staff evacuated due to the threat of violence from a southern army. Greene remained and took on the brunt of the medical work. When the Southern army reached Changsha, Greene began to interact with Nationalist leadership in a medical capacity, as well as with other key figures. When Communism gained currency in Changsha in the fall of 1926, servants and nurses went on strike, leaving the Hsiang-Ya hospital with few staff. Despite the imprisonment of many fellow doctors and the closing of other schools by the growing Communist regime, Greene kept the Hsiang-Ya campus running. His wife noted: \\"... we were the only school, private of government, general or technical, in the whole city that was still in operation.\\" However, Greene too was eventually asked to evacuate in January 1927, when Americans were ordered out of China by the U.S. Government.  Work in the United States  In 1927 Greene and his family fled China due to the Chinese Civil War, remaining in the United States until 1931. During this time, Greene worked as the assistant professor of surgery at University of Wisconsin Medical School. Changsha's violent takeover by the Communist bands of Kiangsi delayed the Greenes' return to Hsiang-Ya until fall 1931.  Return to China  Greene worked in China from 1931-1941 as Head of the Department of Surgery and Dean of Hsiang-Ya Medical school, and then from 1941-43 as Director of the American Red Cross in China. Greene arrived in Shanghai at the time of the Manchurian Incident, when the Sino-Japanese War began, and he treated refugees of natural disaster and war alike while re- staffing the medical school and hospital. He met with leaders of public health, including the Chinese National Board of Health (now the Ministry of Health), to cement standardized government requirements for medical curricula. In 1933 Greene was commissioned for major responsibility in the Chinese government's public health program in Kuling. He was also responsible for organizing 30,000 aid kits as the Chinese armies moved against Japan. Later that year, Greene secured the aid of the League of Nations Advisor to China on Public Health in developing Hsiang-Ya's public health program, among the first in the nation. Coordinating with the Chinese government, Greene also saw Hsiang-Ya's public health program expand to regions beyond Changsha, using the buildings of closed mission hospitals as dispensaries for education and treatment. In 1936 Greene was granted a one-year furlough, followed by a re- appointment in Changsha by the Yale-in-China Association. Phillips and Ruth Greene spent this year raising American awareness of the social, political, and religious climate of China. The Greenes returned to Changsha at the height of the Sino-Japanese War. The family barely avoided being in Shanghai when it was bombed by the Japanese on August 12, 1937. Once Greene arrived in Changsha, bombing victims were sent to him for treatment from Liling and other cities on the battle front. 1938 Changsha Fire On November 24, 1937, Japanese forces bombed Changsha. The city was now on the fighting front of the war. Despite the American consul's pressure to evacuate, Greene remained to treat wounds of civilians. As military personnel and refugees from Japanese- controlled cities inundated Changsha, Greene opened new dispensaries and clinics. By December, both Yale-in-China and authorities in Changsha were urging all foreign families out of China, must urgently the women and children. Ruth and the children took refuge in Manila, The Philippines, while Greene remained in the war zone. A first-hand account of conditions in January 1937 is given by Greene's first cousin, Lois Greene MD, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, in the \\"Inside China\\" column of The Stanford Daily.Greene, Lois MD. 1937. Inside China, the Stanford Daily. https://stanforddailyarchive.com/cgi- bin/stanford?a=d&d;=stanford19380107-01.2.46 In February 1938, bombings of Changsha escalated. Greene sent most nursing and medical students away to Kweiyang, and kept the most advanced students to keep the hospital in operation. By November 1938, Greene was the sole remaining doctor in Changsha. During the 1938 Changsha Fire,Taylor, Jay (2009). The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the Making of Modern China. p. 158. Greene and his colleagues were able to keep the militants from burning down the hospital as well. Greene stayed in Changsha to treat burn victims. He was then responsible for the transport of medical supplies to the Chinese interior. Despite his train being bombed, Greene successfully brought medicine from Shanghai to Changsha and continued to treat outbreaks of disease there. Again in January 1940, Greene took the risk of transporting 2 tons of medical supplies past the Japanese front to Changsha and Kweiyang, where the Hsiang-Ya medical school had been relocated. While working in Kweiyang, the Central Hospital where Greene was working was bombed. He returned to Changsha to re-establish Hsiang-Ya in June 1940. In view of the worsening political situation, the American Consul in Kunming requested Greene's return to America. Greene refused and remained in Changsha. In November 1940 Greene received on official Certificate of Merit for service in medical education from the National Bureau of Education in Chungking. In 1941 Greene was appointed Director of the American Red Cross in Chungking. He was responsible for the intake of all forms of civilian aid by truck over the Burma Road, and by airlift over the Himalayas. This position entailed the acceptance of supplies into Chungking, and their distribution to both Nationalist and Communist groups. He then returned to the United States in 1943.  Return to the U.S.  In 1944, Greene served as associate dean and clinical professor of surgery at Long Island College of Medicine. He had planned to teach war surgery there for six months before returning to China, but ended up staying at the College until 1951.  Work in Burma  In 1951, Phillips Greene accepted a position as staff member in the Rangoon, Burma General Hospital and Medical School, where he remained until 1958.  Late life  In 1958, Phillips Greene returned to the United States to practice medicine there until his death. Greene died on April 11, 1967 in New Richmond, Ohio.  Legacy  The letters of Phillips Greene are recorded by his wife Ruth in Hsiang-Ya Journal, an account of Greene's work in China.  Hsiang-Ya Hospital  The Hsiang-Ya Hospital and Medical school is now the Hunan Medical School of the People's Republic of China. Greene's preservation of the Hsiang-Ya hospital not only allowed the hospital to continue despite eventual Japanese occupation and subsequent Communist takeover, but also allowed the Yale-China Association to continue, eventually returning to Changsha.

History It was created on 5 January 1888 as the District Council of Davenport under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887, but was renamed Woolundunga on 8 June 1893 to avoid confusion with the adjacent Corporate Town of Davenport, a separate municipality. The principal township was Stirling North. The council constructed purpose-built chambers at Stirling North in 1894, and operated out of them for the remainder of their existence. At its creation, the council area was more than , including all the formerly unincorporated parts of the County of Newcastle west of the Dutchmans Range and Middle Range ridge line (Kanyaka council west border) as well as the Hundred of Winninowie and parts of the hundreds of Davenport and Woolundunga remaining unincorporated in the County of Frome.

She was known for the clarity of her writing and her efforts to educate the general public about scientific subjects. Education Elizabeth Armstrong \\"Betty\\" Wood was born October 19, 1912, in New York, New York. She went to Barnard College for her B.A. and Bryn Mawr College for her master's degree and doctorate in geology. She went on to become an instructor in geology at Bryn Mawr for the 1934‚Äì35 and 1937‚Äì38 academic years. In the same period, she was an instructor in geology and mineralogy at Barnard (1935‚Äì37, 1938‚Äì41). She eventually became a research assistant at Columbia University. Career In 1942, Wood‚Äîwhose interest in crystallography had developed at Bryn Mawr‚Äîtook a job in the Physical Research Department of Bell Telephone Laboratories, where she was their first woman scientist. For over two decades, she ran a crystallographic research program at Bell Labs, focusing primarily on the electromagnetic properties of crystals. She addressed such problems as growing single crystals that would have useful conductive, magnetic, or other properties; as well as investigating new crystalline materials with ferromagnetic or piezoelectric properties. She looked at phase transitions in silicon, irradiation coloring in quartz, and ways to change the state of certain materials through the application of electric fields. In the course of her research, she developed \\"the first systematic notation for surface crystallography\\". Her work fed into the development of new superconductors and lasers at Bell Labs. Wood became known for the clarity of her writing, particularly in books intended for nonscientists such as Science for the Airplane Passenger (1969). Her Crystals and Light (1964), written for people with no prior background in optics, was long considered the standard beginner's textbook in the field. A version of this book, Experiments with Crystals and Light (1964), was put out by Bell Labs for high school students as both a booklet and an experiment kit. Her Crystal Orientation Manual (1963) was a handbook for technicians on the proper preparation of crystals for research. As the title of her 1962 book Rewarding Careers for Women in Physics (1962) suggests, she championed efforts to bring more women into the sciences, speaking out on the issues involved‚Äîsuch as cultural disapproval of professional women‚Äîat meetings and conferences. From the 1950s to the 1970s, Bell Labs spent some $500 million on technologies to create a videophone. In 1964, Bell Labs debuted its \\"Picturephone\\" system with limited commercial service in a few cities. The service was inaugurated with a ceremonial call from First Lady Lady Bird Johnson to Wood in Bell Labs' videophone center in New York City.Novak, Matt. \\"How Bell Labs Almost Put a Videophone in Every Home\\". Paleofuture (blog). June 15, 2014. Wood was a fellow of the American Physical Society. She was awarded honorary doctorates by Wheaton College (1963), Western College, Ohio (1965), and Worcester Polytechnic (1970). Throughout her career, Wood undertook leadership roles in a number of professional organizations. One of her more prominent efforts was to participate in the founding of the American Crystallographic Association (ACA) out of a merger between the American Society for X-Ray and Electron Diffraction (ASXRED) and the Crystallographic Society of America (CSA). In 1957, she became the ACA's first woman president. Other leadership activities included the following: *Chair, U.S. delegation to International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) General Assembly (1957) *Board member, American Institute of Physics (AIP, 1963‚Äì69) *Associate Director, National Science Foundation's Physical Science for Nonscience Students Project (1965-1971) *AIP Commission on College Physics (1967-1971) *Member, IUCr Commission on Crystallographic Teaching (1969-1972) Wood died March 23, 2006, of a stroke.

He also confirmed the existence of megaliths in the southern Urals. He also contributed to the study and discussion of the origin of the Proto-Indo- Europeans. Rezepkin sees Novosvobodnaya culture as independent from Maikop culture. Ornament on black ceramics of Novosvobodnaya culture. Klady (Hashpek). 2006. For the first time, Rezepkin linked the finds from Novosvobodnaya with the artifacts of the Funnelbeaker culture from the ancient Germany and Denmark, rather than with the Globular Amphora culture, as was thought previously. He sees the Funnelbeakers as prior to the Globular Amphora culture, and dates Novosvobodnaya culture to 3600-3000 BC. According to Rezepkin, the difference between Novosvobodnaya and Maykop is that Novosvobodnaya, in the early stages of its development, had clearly Western roots, and Maykop Near Eastern ones. According to Rezepkin, in Novosvobodnaya culture we see the real meeting of East and West. However, some other archaeologists insist on a wider Maykop-Novosvobodnaya cultural unity, while both cultures did feature various local variants.–ö–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–π –°. –ù. –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–µ–π—à–∏–µ –∑–µ–º–ª–µ–¥–µ–ª—å—Ü—ã –∏ —Å–∫–æ—Ç–æ–≤–æ–¥—ã –ü—Ä–µ–¥–∫–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—å—è: –ú–∞–π–∫–æ–ø—Å–∫–æ-–Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –æ–±—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π —Ç–∏–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏. –ú., 2004  Genetic research  Together with the geneticist A.V.

This DNA sample was isolated from the mitochondria of skeletal remains from the burial ground Klady. MtDNA haplogroup V has been reported in Neolithic remains of the Linear Pottery culture at Halberstadt, Germany c. 5000 BC and Derenburg Meerenstieg, Germany c. 4910 BC. Haplogroup V7 was found in representative of Novosvobodnaya culture. However, these are clearly due to the Neolithic expansion and nothing else.  The origin of the Indo-Europeans  According to Rezepkin, Central Europe must have been the homeland of the Indo-Europeans (Proto-Indo-European homeland).–†–µ–∑–µ–ø–∫–∏–Ω –ê. –î. // –ö—É—Ä–≥–∞–Ω 31 –º–æ–≥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞ –ö–ª–∞–¥—ã. –ü—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑–∏—Å–∞ –∏ —Ö—Ä–æ–Ω–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –º–∞–π–∫–æ–ø—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã// –î—Ä–µ–≤–Ω–∏–µ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã –ü—Ä–∏–∫—É–±–∞–Ω—å—è (–ø–æ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª–∞–º —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç –≤ –∑–æ–Ω–∞—Ö –º–µ–ª–∏–æ—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–¥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫—Ä–∞—è) / –û—Ç–≤. —Ä–µ–¥. –í. –ú. –ú–∞—Å—Å–æ–Ω. ‚Äî –õ.: –ù–∞—É–∫–∞, 1991. ‚Äî –°.167-197 Accordingly, Indo-Europeans were behind the successive Linear Pottery culture, the Funnelbeaker culture, the Globular Amphora culture, and the Corded Ware culture. In favor of this view is the apparent lack of any abrupt change in European populations since the Neolithic, and until the first written sources appear. Rezepkin sees the emergence of Novosvobodnaya culture as the result of a migration from Europe. Their 'Megalitism', their black-polished ceramic amphorae, bowls and cups, find a compelling analogy in the Funnelbeaker culture of Germany.  Recent discoveries  Several important discoveries were made by Rezepkin in the course of his excavations. Among them what seems as the oldest sword in the world.  The oldest sword  This ancient bronze sword dates to around 3400 BC. It was found in a stone tomb near Novosvobodnaya, and is now on display in the Hermitage in St. Petersburg. It was discovered in Kurgan 31, tomb 5 at the burial site Klady, which is attributed to the Maikop culture. This burial belongs to local Phase 3 at Klady, corresponding to the last Phase 4 of the Maikop culture. It has a total length of 63 cm and a hilt length of 11 cm.The Sword, chapter I: Birth of the Swordsman The radiocarbon dates for Phase 3 at Klady are 3500-3342 (68% probability), and 3500-3128 (95% probability). Previously, the oldest swords were reported from Arslantepe, and they are dated soon after the Klady sword, or about a century later.

It was designed by Frederic Herbert Faircloth and built from 1920 to 1921 by Anselm & Odling (Sydney). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Unveiling of the completed War Memorial Statue, July 1921 The Bundaberg War Memorial was incomplete when it was first unveiled on 31 July 1921, as the statue had not arrived from Italy. On 30 July that year, it was unveiled in its complete form by Major-General Charles Brand. It was designed by Bundaberg architect, F. H. Faircloth and the masonry contractors were Anselm and Odling of Sydney. The granite, trachyte and marble memorial honours one local man who served in the Second Boer War and the 227 local men who served in the First World War. Bundaberg owes its survival to the growth of the sugar industry in the 1880s. The Millaquin refinery and private milling companies invested in the area and by 1920 the city had become directly and indirectly dependent on the sugar industry. The impetus for a memorial in Bundaberg originated with the local Soldiers' Reception Committee. On 15 May 1920, the foundation stone was laid by General Sir William Birdwood. The base and column were created in Sydney, which may explain the use of trachyte, a material more commonly used for memorials in New South Wales than in Queensland. Australia, and Queensland in particular, had few civic monuments before the First World War. The memorials erected in its wake became our first national monuments, recording the devastating impact of the war on a young nation. Australia lost 60,000 from a population of about 4 million, representing one in five of those who served. No previous or subsequent war has made such an impact on the nation. Even before the end of the war, memorials became a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites, substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East. British policy decreed that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell. The word \\"cenotaph\\", commonly applied to war memorials at the time, literally means \\"empty tomb\\". Australian war memorials are distinctive in that they commemorate not only the dead. Australians were proud that their first great national army, unlike other belligerent armies, was composed entirely of volunteers, men worthy of honour whether or not they made the supreme sacrifice. Many memorials honour all who served from a locality, not just the dead, providing valuable evidence of community involvement in the war. Such evidence is not readily obtainable from military records, or from state or national listings, where names are categorised alphabetically or by military unit. Australian war memorials are also valuable evidence of imperial and national loyalties, at the time, not seen as conflicting; the skills of local stonemasons, metalworkers and architects; and of popular taste. In Queensland, the soldier statue was the popular choice of memorial, whereas the obelisk predominated in the southern states, possibly a reflection of Queensland's larger working-class population and a lesser involvement of architects. Many of the First World War monuments have been updated to record local involvement in later conflicts, and some have fallen victim to unsympathetic re-location and repair. Although there are many different types of memorials in Queensland, the digger statue is the most common. It was the most popular choice of communities responsible for erecting the memorials, embodying the Anzac spirit and representing the qualities of the ideal Australian: loyalty, courage, youth, innocence and masculinity. The digger was a phenomenon peculiar to Queensland, perhaps due to the fact that other states had followed Britain's lead and established Advisory Boards made up of architects and artists, prior to the erection of war memorials. The digger statue was not highly regarded by artists and architects who were involved in the design of relatively few Queensland memorials. Most statues were constructed by local masonry firms, although some were by artists or imported. The Bundaberg digger was imported from Italy and is constructed of Italian marble. The completed memorial, at a cost of , was the third most costly to be erected in Queensland. It is a major regional memorial and one of the two most intact digger memorials that remain in their original settings of intersections. (The other is located in Aramac). It is an unusual example of the work of F H Faircloth. F. H. Faircloth was born in Maryborough in . He was articled to Bundaberg architect Anton Hettrich before establishing his own practice in 1893. In 1894 he became an Associate of the Queensland Institute of Architecture, becoming a Fellow in 1899. Although he lived in Bundaberg for the whole of his professional life, he did not involve himself with the community, preferring to dedicate his life to his architecture. He was responsible for rebuilding much of the Childers Central Business District after the fire of 1902 and also for many substantial buildings in Bundaberg. The masons, Anselm and Odling were a large firm that had agencies throughout Australia and in London and Italy. It is through these contacts that they were able to import Italian marble digger statues into Australia. They were extensive suppliers of masonry materials and were constantly in pursuit of memorial work.  Description  Diggers' Memorial, Bundaberg, 1921 The First World War Memorial is situated at the main intersection of Bundaberg on a traffic island consisting of alternating bands of grass and concrete running parallel to Bourbong Street. The height of the memorial complements the adjacent Post Office tower. At high, the memorial is of a massive scale and comprises a pedestal surmounted by a column and a digger statue. The monument sits on a large trachyte and granite pedestal comprising a central recessed square pillar with engaged square pillars at each corner. The central pillar sits on a simply detailed trachyte base and is flanked by sections of banded stone. The central section of each face bears the cut and gilded names of one local soldier who served in the Boer War and the 277 who served in the First World Wars. Commemorative plates to later conflicts have been added to the pedestal. The corner pillars sit on trachyte bases and have small cornices surmounted by rusticated stone blocks from which red granite pillars rise. The whole of the pedestal is surmounted by a large frieze and cornice. Above the cornice sits an octagonal two stepped base of trachyte surmounted by a circular step. This forms a base for a red granite column with a marble Ionic order capital. Surmounting the column is a marble digger statue, which is life-sized. The soldier stands with his head bowed and his hands are resting on a rifle which is reversed. He carries a backpack and his right leg is bent to create a relaxed stance.

The society has since 1811 been involved in work for blind people. Princess Elisabeth of Denmark is protector of the organization. Its building, situated at Klerkegade 10, was listed in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 1 October 1989. History The Order of the Chain is believed to have originated in St Canute's Guild in the 12th century. The Order of the Chain terminated its activities in the late 17th century but it was revived by a group of former freemasons on 27 November 1774. Membership of the order has been open to both men and women from the time of its foundation. The order has been engaged in social-philanthropical work since 1780. One of its first projects was to raise the necessary 100 rigsdaler for the construction of the first public school in Bornholm. Building The Society of the Chain is headquartered in a low Renaissance Revival style building at Klerkegade 10 in Copenhagen. The design is by Vilhelm Tvede. It was¬¥listed in 1989. Activities From 1811 the order has been involved in work for the blind. In 1858, it financed the construction of the Royal Institute for the Blind which was ceded to the Danish state upon its completion. In 1876, it expanded its headquarters with two new wings which were used as a home for blind people. It remained in use until 1971. Since 1829-30, the order has also catered to the poor in Copenhagen. See also * Royal Copenhagen Shooting Society ReferencesFurther reading * Collin. Edgar: In Mindeblade ved Deres Kgl.

Tucker Company (or simply F.C. Tucker) is a real estate company based in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is the state's largest independent real estate firm by sales revenue with 45 sales offices in Indiana and Kentucky (as of 2010). The F.C. Tucker Company led numerous developments in downtown Indianapolis in the 1960s and 70's including Market Square Arena, the Hilton Indianapolis, and Merchants Plaza. In 2002, a REAL Trends survey listed F.C. Tucker as the 12th largest regional brand in the United States. History The company was founded in 1918 by Frederick Caldwell (F.C.) Tucker, Sr. In the early years, Tucker, Sr. operated the business as a sole proprietorship, working in commercial and industrial real estate. In 1947, Tucker's son, Fred C. \\"Bud\\" Tucker, Jr., joined the company. The elder Tucker died in 1958 and Tucker, Jr. purchased the company with three other businessmen: John A. Wallace, Robert E. Houk, and Edward Joseph Boleman. The company began using its slogan, \\"Talk to Tucker,\\" in the early 1960s. The slogan remains a part of the company's marketing strategy to the present day. Fred \\"Bud\\" Tucker was instrumental in pushing for development in downtown Indianapolis in the 1960s and 70's. In 1967, he persuaded local investors to finance a Hilton hotel near Monument Circle for $3.5 million. It was the first new hotel to be built in downtown Indianapolis in 40 years. One of the investors in the project was L.S. Ayres and Company, an Indianapolis-based department store. The Hilton Indianapolis was completed in 1971 and contained 430 rooms with 14,300 square feet of ballrooms and meeting rooms. F.C. Tucker and L.S. Ayres were also part of an investor group that sought to develop the Lincoln Hotel block. The $45-million project consisted of three towers (one each for office space, a hotel, and an apartment complex), an open-air plaza, and a convention center. This project would eventually be named \\"Merchants Plaza.\\" In the early 1970s, the Indiana Pacers announced their intention of moving to a new arena. Their current arena, the State Fairgrounds Coliseum, had fallen into disrepair. John Jewett, an employee at F.C. Tucker, devised a plan for a new arena in Indianapolis to keep the Pacers in the city. The project became known as the Market Square Arena and development in the arena itself and the surrounding area (including the Gold Building) was led by F.C. Tucker. The city paid for one-third of the arena while an investor group that included F.C. Tucker and the Indiana National Bank paid the remaining two-thirds of the $32-million price tag. The arena was completed in 1974, but the Pacers had failed to make a profit in Indianapolis by 1977. As a representative of F.C. Tucker, Jewett led a three- month \\"Save the Pacers\\" campaign that culminated in a telethon that sought to increase the number of season tickets sold. The campaign was a success and the Pacers remain in Indianapolis to the present day. At one point, F.C. Tucker held a 30% ownership stake in the Pacers. In the 1980s, the company continued with major development projects, including the Canterbury Hotel. The 1928 building originally known as the Lockerbie Hotel was renovated in 1982 and reopened under the new name. In 1986, Tucker, Houk, Wallace and Boleman retired, and Bud's son, Fred C. Tucker, III, David W. Goodrich and H. James Litten purchased the company. In 1996, Goodrich was elected President of the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, an international professional organization of commercial Realtors. In 1998, he facilitated the merger of the company's Commercial Real Estate Services Division to Turley Martin, an allied commercial real estate firm (through Colliers International) headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, and sold his interest in the Tucker Company to his partners to become EVP of Turley Martin Tucker. By the year 2000, the Residential Real Estate Services Division had more than 500 sales associates in 13 offices in the Indianapolis area alone. In 2001, their residential sales revenue was $2.1 billion. In 2005, Litten received the Distinguished Realtor of the Year award from the Metropolitan Indianapolis Board of Realtors. In 2010, Fred C. Tucker, III retired as company president and sold his stake in the company to James Litten. At the time of his departure, the company oversaw 45 offices in Indiana and Kentucky and maintained 1,500 sales associates in those offices. Tucker, III had been at the company for 33 years. Litten, who started at the company in 1972 as a residential sales associate, became the President of F.C. Tucker on April 1, 2010. In 2013, Litten was named to the Swanepoel Power 200 list as one of the most powerful people in real estate, and as of 2015 the company has grown to 1,500 agents with $3.2 billion in sales. Operation The F.C. Tucker Company provides a wide array of real estate products and services. They provide real estate brokerage, home insurance, mortgages, title insurance, and various other insurance and homeowner warranty products. F.C. Tucker also operates 8 additional businesses. These businesses include Home Services, Title Services LLC, Tucker Associates Inc., Tucker Insurance Agency, Tucker Mortgage LLC, Tucker/Schrader Auction Company LP, Tucker Referrals Inc., and the Tucker School of Real Estate. They also maintain a strategic alliance with HMS Home Warranty.

The principle of LSD is derived from schlieren photography: a narrow laser beam is used to scan an area in a gas where changes in properties are associated with characteristic changes of refractive index. Laser schlieren deflectometry is claimed to overcome limitations of other methods regarding temporal and spatial resolution. The theory of the method is analogous to the scattering experiment of Ernest Rutherford from 1911. However, instead of alpha particles scattered by gold atoms, here an optical ray is deflected by hot spots with unknown temperature. A general equation of LSD describes the dependence of the measured maximum deflection of the ray Œ¥1 on the local maximum of the neutral gas temperature in the hot spot T1: : \\\\frac{T_0}{T_1} + \\\\frac{\\\\delta_1}{\\\\delta_0} = 1, where T0 is ambient temperature and Œ¥0 is a calibration constant depending on the configuration of the experiment.

It is bisected by the Hill River, an ephemeral stream from which it derives its name. Its boundaries were created in January 2001 for the ‚Äúlong established name.‚Äù Hill River is located within the federal division of Grey, the state electoral district of Frome and the local government area of the District Council of Clare and Gilbert Valleys. History Prior to European settlement it was the traditional home of the Ngadjuri people. The first European explorer to discover the Hill River area was Edward John Eyre on 5 June 1839. He named the river after explorer John Hill because he was \\"the gentleman who discovered its twin river, the Hutt\\". Eyre described the area as \\"a fine chain of ponds taking its course through a very extensive and grassy valley, but with little timber of any kind growing near it.\\" The first pastoralist of Hill River was Charles Campbell (1811‚Äì59), an overlander who established a sheep run there in 1842 in connection with Henry Strong Price (1825‚Äì89). He took out an occupation licence in January 1843. Their resident stock-keeper was William Roach. In 1844 overlander William Robinson (1814‚Äì1889) established Hill River Station along the upper reaches of the waterway, near Clare. The artist S.T. Gill visited in 1846 as part of the ill-fated Horrocks expedition. Gill prepared several watercolours of the thriving homestead, which was at that time perhaps the most advanced pastoral establishment in the Mid North.Painting: Hill River Station went on to become one of the great South Australian pastoral properties of the 1800s, being subsequently owned 1855‚Äì76 by C.B. Fisher and then by John Howard Angas, setting numerous records for its production of wool and sheep. A 1600mm gauge railway line, the Spalding railway line, which closed in 1984 and is now removed, ran as a spur line from Clare, through the Hill River valley, parallel to the river, with stations at Barinia, Hilltown, Andrews and Spalding (the terminus).

For five successive FEAA Games, he made the national team: 1921 in Shanghai; 1923 in Osaka; 1925 in Manila; 1927 in Shanghai and 1930 in Tokyo. After completing his primary schooling in Malate, he moved to Paco Elementary then to Manila High. He started his college education at Jose Rizal College. The best Philippine showing in FEAA Games was in 1925 when the Filipinos swept both rounds. With him were Vicente Avena, Dionisio Calvo, Mariano Filomeno, Joaquin I√±igo, Pedro Robles, Jose Rodriguez, Alfredo Del Rosario, Lou Salvador and Mariano Sangle. Upon his retirement, Bautista served in various capacities in basketball, aside from being assistant coach to Del Rosario in the 1934 FEAA Games, he served in the same year in the defunct PAAF. In 1956, he was team manager of the basketball team in the Melbourne Olympics and again in 1960 Rome Olympics.
