Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series Truck No. 02 history The team debuted in the 2012 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series season with Tyler Young in a part-time schedule. In 2013, Young returned again for a part-time schedule. In 2014 the team ran its first full-time season, again with Young. In 2016, the team returned to a part-time schedule, sharing the No. 02 with Austin Hill Racing and Rette Jones Racing. Dylan Lupton, Austin Theriault, Derek Scott Jr. and Scott Lagasse Jr. also drove the 02 in 2016. In 2017, the team announced that the truck would be split by Austin Hill and Tyler Young. Australian sprint car racing driver Max Johnston drove the truck at Eldora Speedway. In 2018, Austin Hill drove the 02 full-time. Despite scoring a top- five at Texas, six top-tens and an eleventh-place finish in points, Hill said that rules changes and simple mistakes by the team held them back from greater success. In 2019, Tyler Dippel joined Young's Motorsports to drive the No. 02 full-time. On August 23, NASCAR announced that Dippel had been suspended indefinitely for violation of the sport's Code of Conduct. Young's Motorsports has not yet announced his substitute replacement for the race at Canada nor the following races until his suspension is lifted. D. J. Kennington served as his substitute replacement for the race at Canada. Dippel was reinstated the following week on August 28, 2019. Truck No. 6 history This truck only ran one race back in 2013 at Rockingham when Tyler Young drove it to a 24th place finish. Truck No. 12 history In 2018, the team debuted at Iowa Speedway with Reid Wilson behind the wheel. Ty Dillon drove at Eldora Speedway. Alex Tagliani was announced to drive at Mosport. In 2019, Gus Dean joined Young's Motorsports to drive the No. 12 full-time.

Bell entered the Young's Motorsports No. 12 at the spring Atlanta race. Truck No. 20 history The No. 20 was Austin Hill Racing's former number. In 2017, with Hill now on No. 02 truck, the second truck became the No. 20. The team debuted at Iowa Speedway. Speed Energy Formula Off-Road champion Sheldon Creed drove the No. 20 at Eldora Speedway. The team planned to run full-time with the No. 20 team in 2018. Scott Lagasse Jr. drove the No. 20 Chevrolet in the season opener at Daytona with a 5th-place finish. Austin and Ty Dillon soon after announced through Team Dillon that Richard Childress Racing affiliated drivers, including Austin, Ty, Daniel Hemric and Tanner Thorson would pilot the 20 for the vast majority of the remaining schedule, with Thorson taking most of the races. Michel Disdier, Reid Wilson, Tate Fogleman, Darrell Wallace Jr. and Max Tullman also drove the 20 truck in 2018. For the 2019 season, Spencer Boyd was announced to pilot the 20 full-time. He started off the season with a career-best fourth-place result at the 2019 NextEra Energy 250. Boyd raced the team to an unofficial second-place finish in the 2019 Sugarlands Shine 250 at Talladega, however the unofficial winner, Johnny Sauter, would be penalized for forcing the No. 51 KBM truck of Riley Herbst below the double yellow line in an attempt to block, giving the win to Boyd and Young's Motorsports. Truck No. 42 history In 2014, the team fielded a second truck (No. 60) for Charles Lewandoski at Daytona but the team withdrew. The team returned at Kansas as a start and park team to help fund the team's No. 02 car but now with a new number (No. 42). After 6 races the No. 42 team shut down.

Elio Miguel Garc√≠a Jr. (born May 6, 1978) and Linda Maria Antonsson (born November 18, 1974) are authors known for their contributions and expertise in the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, co-writing in 2014 with Martin The World of Ice & Fire, a companion book for the series. They are also the founders of the fansite Westeros.org, one of the earliest fan websites for A Song of Ice and Fire. Career Elio Garc√≠a was attending the University of Miami, while his partner Linda Antonsson was living in Sweden. At that time, in 1996, Antonsson introduced Garc√≠a to the A Song of Ice and Fire book series when it came out on paperback. After the second book, A Clash of Kings, was released, they decided to create a forum for discussion of the series, creating an early iteration of Westeros.org, and later expanded it as the series became more popular. As of 2016, Westeros.org had more than 100,000 registered members. Garc√≠a and Antonsson have communicated closely with George R. R. Martin, serving sometimes as fact checkers and researchers of the A Song of Ice and Fire universe. They first approached Martin when they had the desire to create a game based on the series, seeking his permission, and created Westeros.org as an information source about how to play the game, titled \\"Blood of Dragons\\", but it transformed to become more encompassing of the entire series as a whole, with discussion forums, news, and a Wiki. Around 2000, when A Storm of Swords was published, Garc√≠a and Antonsson began compiling a concordance of facts and details about Westeros, which they sent to Martin, leading him to state that they knew more about Westeros than he did. During the writing of the series' fourth book, A Feast for Crows, the couple became a regular fact checker for details regarding the series' many characters and locations. After meeting with Martin in person in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the pair was approached by Martin to co-author a book titled The World of Ice & Fire, a companion book which focuses primarily on the history of the Targaryen family, one of the main families presented in the books. The book is written from the point of view that it is a scholarly work of a maester at the Citadel, the main center of knowledge in the world of Westeros. They work together from their home in N√∂dinge-Nol, near Gothenburg, Sweden. Antonsson has stated that they never contribute to the main series of books on a story level, rather about setting details and continuity details. In addition to writing, Antonsson has also done English to Swedish translating, including for Game of Thrones. The pair provided episode recaps, analysis and video commentary for each episode of Game of Thrones on westeros.org, but as the television series surpassed the book series, they have become critics of many of the show's plot conveniences, in their view, and \\"clich√©s\\"; following the 6th season of the program, Garcia announced that he would no longer be watching the show, after which Antonsson began doing the episode reviews and commentary alone. Personal life Garc√≠a and Antonsson met in 1995 while playing a game based on The Lord of the Rings over the internet. They were married in 2014, the same day that The World of Ice & Fire was released, 16 years after the couple had become engaged. Garc√≠a moved to Sweden in 1999, where the couple now lives in N√∂dinge, Ale Municipality.

History Mount Bogart was named by Donaldson Bogart Dowling (1858-1925), after his mother, whose maiden name was Bogart. Donaldson Dowling, an engineer with the Geological Survey of Canada, explored the area in 1904. The first ascent of the peak was made in 1930 by Kate Gardiner and Walter Feuz.

It is loosely based on the crimes of the Italian serial killer known as \\"the Monster of Florence\\".  Plot  A couple drives to a secluded lovers' lane on the outskirts of Florence to have sex, and is gunned down by a gloved prowler, who uses a knife and a tree branch to sexually mutilate the body of the female victim. The double homicide is the latest in a series of them, the work of a serial killer dubbed \\"Il Mostro\\" who Christiana Marelli, a criminology student, is researching for her thesis, to the dismay of her professor, the local police, and her doctor boyfriend, Alex. As Christiana investigates Il Mostro, she begins receiving strange telephone calls, and finds herself being shadowed by a stalker, who at one point attempts to break into her apartment while she is home alone. A bartender who had offered to meet with Christiana to provide her with information is later found hanged, and Christiana begins to suspect that her boyfriend is Il Mostro due to a combination of mounting circumstantial evidence, Alex's conspicuous absences during all of the murders, and the fact that she had told him about her planned rendezvous with the barkeep shortly before the man was found dead. After a couple whom she knew personally is murdered by Il Mostro, Christiana attends a s√©ance in the hope that it can summon the victims' spirits, and shed light on the identity of Il Mostro. During the ceremony, the medium has a vision of Il Mostro butchering a pair of camping lovers, and spontaneously develops a wound similar to one that Il Mostro had inflicted upon one of the new victims. Christiana leaves the s√©ance and races to the theater that she had last seen Alex at; she finds him there, which seemingly puts to rest her suspicions of him being Il Mostro. The film ends with Christiana making her way to the seat next to Alex (at one point muttering \\"excuse me\\" to the viewer) before settling in to watch L'assassino √® ancora tra noi.

In childhood she lived the traditional nomadic Inuit life, but the difficult winter of 1958 led to the family's resettlement in the community of Baker Lake, where shortly thereafter she married. With encouragement from her mother and her sister Victoria, she began carving in 1962; her first drawings followed in 1969. She also works in fabric. Pukingrnak's work draws heavily on Inuit mythology, and includes depictions of Kiviuq and Kavaq. Unlike older Inuit artists, her work shows a knowledge of Western spatial perspective. Her art was first exhibited in 1974 at a showing of Baker Lake sculpture in Montreal, and in 1976 she had her first solo show, at the Upstairs Gallery in Winnipeg.

It is also distributed amongst the inland areas of the Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and the northern half of South Australia. The Sturt‚Äôs Pigface is listed as near threatened with rare sightings at the Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales and is more commonly documented to be present in the northern parts of South Australia and Western Australia. Taxonomy The species was first formally described as Sesuvium quadrifidum by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 in the work Report on the Plants Collected During Mr. Babbage's Expedition into the North West Interior of South Australia in 1858. It was reclassified by von Mueller in 1861 as Aizoon quadrifidum and then again in 1889 by Ferdinand Albin Pax to the genus Gunniopsis in the Prantl and Engler's work Die Naturlichen Pflanzenfamilien. Closely related species There are 14 species that comprise the genus of Gunniopis that were once members of the genera Aizoon, Gunnia and Neogunnia all of which share similar plant morphology driven by evolutionary forces that allow the species to adapt to the arid and saline environments. The name is derived from the Greek word opsis meaning resembling which alludes to the resemblance of the genus to the genus Gunnia Specially, the 14 recognized species includes: ¬∑ Gunniopsis divisa ¬∑ Gunniopsis glabra ¬∑ Gunniopsis intermedia ¬∑ Gunniopsis kochii ¬∑ Gunniopsis papillata ¬∑ Gunniopsis propinqua ¬∑ Gunniopsis quadrifida ¬∑ Gunniopsis rodwayi ¬∑ Gunniopsis rubra ¬∑ Gunniopsis septifraga ¬∑ Gunniopsis tenuifolia ¬∑ Gunniopsis zygophylloides ¬∑ Gunniopsis calcarea Chinnock ¬∑ Gunniopsis calva With Gunniopsis quadrifida being the most common and widespread of the species Conservational Importance The human population is continuing to expand, and with it, the negative consequences such as habitat fragmentation, invasive species and climate change associated with the increase in land-use for development and agricultural purposes, these negative impacts can all contribute to the decline of ecosystem functions, and threaten existing species that inhabit that environment. The Gunniopsis quadrifida population has already been seen to be reduced in its distribution across inland NSW, NT and QLD. This reduction of the population can be due to anthropogenic causes such as targeted exploitation (from illegal harvesting) or more likely due to habitat degradation associated with intensified land-use both aspects of which have been seen to play a role in reducing the biodiversity of floral species when compared to the levels present pre- European settlement. Australia is a country displaying a high-rate of population growth amongst other similar international countries with more than a third of its growth originating amongst the four cities consisting of Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne. Although the majority of population growth is centered on urban areas, through technological advancement driven by an increased need for land required for housing/agriculture akin to the development of metropolitan areas amidst the Mojave desert, the arid landscapes of which the Sturt Pigface currently inhabit in the relative absence of human interaction may be threatened in the future. As various desert animals depend upon the Sturt Pigface for food/shelter, a shift in phenology (which is a common occurrence due to climate change), the interactions between this plant/animal dependence and as such it is important to survey and monitor the Sturt Pigfaces‚Äô in order to preserve the animal species that utilize the plant as a resource, as well as any potential invasive species that may compete with the plant which can increase its susceptibility to extinction.

The locality is on the border of Queensland and New South Wales. In the , Bungunya had a population of 75 people.  Geography  Bungunya is located immediately north of the Macintyre River, which is the border between Queensland and New South Wales. The Weir River flows from east to west through the northern part of the locality. Other creeks flow from east to west through other parts of the locality. All of these rivers and creeks ultimately flow into the Barwon River in New South Wales. The town is located in the approximate centre of the locality. The Barwon Highway (from St George to Goondiwindi) passes from east to west through the middle of the locality, immediately to the north of the town. The Meandarra ‚Äì Talwood Road (State Route 74) runs north from the Barwon Highway through the centre of the northern part of the locality. The South Western railway line (from Warwick to Dirranbandi) also passes from east to west through the locality, but to the immediate south of the town. The locality was once served by the former Bungunya railway station () in the town and by the former Welltown railway station () in the east of the locality. The land is very flat, approximately 180 metres above sea level, and is extensively developed for agriculture. History The name Bungunya is allegedly an Aboriginal word, meaning a high or safe living place. The language and dialect is unknown but it may be an imported name from Victoria. Gamilaraay (Gamilaroi, Kamilaroi, Comilroy) is a language from South-West Queensland and North-West New South Wales. The Gamilaraay language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Balonne Shire Council, including the towns of Dirranbandi, Thallon, Talwood and Bungunya as well as the border towns of Mungindi and Boomi extending to Moree, Tamworth and Coonabarabran in NSW. Bungunya Provisional School opened on a half-time basis in 1916, sharing the teacher with Glengower Provisional School. It became a full-time school in 1918 and a state school soon after. Bungunya was once a busy railway centre from which thousands of bales of wool were transported from local sheep stations following the shearing season.Download In the 2011 census, Bungunya had a population of 189 people.

This includes fungal infections of the foot, impetigo, pemphigus, superficial wounds, dermatitis, and tropical ulcers. For tropical ulcers it is used together with procaine benzylpenicillin. Typically it is used in skin conditions that produce a lot of liquid. It can be applied as a soaked dressing or a bath. Side effects may include irritation of the skin and discoloration of clothing. If it is taken by mouth, toxicity and death may occur. Potassium permanganate is an oxidizing agent. The British National Formulary recommends that each 100 mg be dissolved in a liter of water before use. Potassium permanganate was first made in the 1600s and came into common medical use at least as early as the 1800s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Uses include for fungal infections of the foot, impetigo, pemphigus, superficial wounds, dermatitis (eczema), and tropical ulcers. Typically it is used in skin conditions that produce a lot of liquid. For tropical ulcers it is used together with procaine benzylpenicillin for two to four weeks. It can be used in children and adults. It can be applied as a soaked dressing or a bath. Petroleum jelly may be used on the nails before soaking to prevent their discoloration. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not recommend its use in either the crystal or tablet form. Side effects Topical Side effects may include irritation of the skin and discoloration of clothing. A harsh burn on a child from an undissolved tablet has been reported. For treating eczema, it is recommended using for a few days at a time due to the possibility of it irritating the skin. Higher concentration solutions can result in chemical burns. Therefore, the British National Formulary recommends 100 mg be dissolved in a liter of water before use to form a 1:10,000 (0.01%) solution. Wrapping the dressings soaked with potassium permanganate is not recommended. By mouth If taken by mouth it is deemed to be very toxic. Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath may occur. If a sufficiently large amount (about 10 grams) is eaten death may occur. Concentrated solutions when drunk have resulted in adult respiratory distress syndrome or swelling of the airway. Recommended measures for those who have ingested potassium permanganate include gastroscopy. Activated charcoal or medications to cause vomiting are not recommended. While medications like ranitidine and N-acetylcysteine may be used in toxicity, evidence for this use is poor. Mechanism of action Potassium permanganate functions as an oxidising agent. Through this mechanism it results in disinfection, astringent effects, and decreased smell. History Potassium permanganate was first made in the 1600s and came into common medical use at least as early as the 1800s. During World War I Canadian soldiers were given potassium permanganate in an effort to prevent sexually transmitted infections. Some have attempted to bring about an abortion by putting it in the vagina, though this is not effective. Other historical uses have included as an effort to wash out the stomach in those with strychnine or picrotoxin poisoning. Society and culture In the United States the FDA requires tablets of the medication to be sold by prescription. Potassium permanganate, however, does not have FDA approved uses and therefore non medical grade potassium permanganate is sometimes used for medical use. It is available under a number of brand names including Permasol, Koi Med Tricho-Ex, and Kalii permanganas RFF. It is occasionally called \\"Condy's crystals\\". Other animals Potassium permanganate may be used to prevent the spread of glanders among horses.

Because testing seemed to indicate an elevated level of ethylene glycol in Ryan's blood, authorities suspected antifreeze poisoning and they arrested Patricia Stallings the next day. She was convicted of murder in early 1991 and sentenced to life in prison. Stallings gave birth to another child while incarcerated awaiting trial; he was diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a rare genetic disorder that can mimic antifreeze poisoning. Prosecutors initially did not believe that the sibling's diagnosis had anything to do with Ryan's case and Stallings‚Äô own lawyer failed to produce available evidence as proof of the possibility. After a professor in biochemistry and molecular biology had some of Ryan‚Äôs blood samples tested, he was able to prove that the child had also died from MMA and not ethylene glycol poisoning. Test samples were sent to several commercial labs that used the same method as used on Ryan‚Äôs sample. Nearly half of the test results were incorrect. After spending nearly two years incarcerated, Stallings was released in July 1991. Prosecutors decided to close the case two months later. Stallings sued the hospital and laboratories that were involved in Ryan's care and reached an out-of-court settlement. Background Stallings lived in St. Louis and was a convenience store clerk in the mid-1980s. David Stallings frequently came into her store and they began to date in 1986. They got married in 1988. Their first son, Ryan, was born in April 1989. Patricia took Ryan to Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital in early July 1989. He was experiencing vomiting and difficulty breathing, and he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit. Noting a high level of what they then believed to be ethylene glycol in the baby's blood, physicians suspected that the boy had been poisoned with antifreeze. The infant was placed in protective custody. On August 31 of that year, Stallings was allowed a short visit with her son. Ryan's illness seemed to recur 4 days after the visit, and Stallings was arrested on assault charges on September 5. Ryan was treated for ethylene glycol poisoning but Ryan died two days later. The charges were revised to first-degree murder. Investigation and legal proceedings While she was in jail awaiting trial, Stallings gave birth to another son, David Jr., on February 17, 1990. He was placed in foster care, but in March, he developed similar symptoms as those that had affected Ryan. He was diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), a genetic condition in which the body produces propionic acid, a compound that differs from ethylene glycol by one carbon atom. David Jr. recovered and was placed in foster care. During the investigation and ensuing trial, Stallings's defense attorney wanted to introduce the theory that Ryan had died of MMA, but the prosecutor, George B. McElroy, considered the sibling's diagnosis irrelevant to Ryan's death and the judge, Gary Kramer, would not allow him to advance the theory without any evidence that Ryan was actually affected by MMA. Stallings wanted her attorney to call character witnesses to testify on her behalf, but he did not do so. She was convicted of first-degree murder and given a life sentence. In May 1990, defense attorney Eric Rathbone obtained copies of notes determined to have been written by assistant prosecutor John S. Appelbaum. The notes indicated that the doctor who pronounced Ryan dead had considered the possibility of an MMA diagnosis, but also that he had not tested Ryan for it at the time. After the discovery of the note, prosecutors said that they believed that there were important differences between ethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and they said that even if Ryan had had MMA, they thought that he had also been poisoned. The Stallings case was featured on the Unsolved Mysteries television program, and biochemist William Sly of Saint Louis University saw the episode. He agreed to test Ryan's blood, and gave it to Dr. James Shoemaker, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the Metabolic Screening Lab at St Louis University. Dr. Shoemaker immediately confirmed that Ryan had had MMA. However, ethylene glycol is not a human metabolite, even in cases of MMA, and Patricia Stallings went to trial with no explanation linking MMA to ethylene glycol. Much later, after the case was featured on Unsolved Mysteries, Dr. Shoemaker asked prosecutor George McElroy for the methods that had been used to measure ethylene glycol in Ryan's blood, and McElroy supplied that information. When the method was used on blood from Ryan and DJ, it was seen that propionic acid, which is produced in methylmalonic acidemia, caused a result that careless observers might mistake for ethylene glycol.(J Pediatr, 120(3) 417-21, 1992). Dr. Shoemaker then sent samples of propionate-spiked blood to several laboratories, who tested it with the same methods used in the Stallings case. Some of the laboratories came to the incorrect conclusion that the blood reflected ethylene glycol poisoning. At Sly's and Shoemaker's request, Piero Rinaldo of Yale University also looked at the case and concluded that Ryan had died of MMA. His testimony helped to convince McElroy that Ryan might not have been poisoned. In July 1991, Stallings was released from jail pending a new trial. She was placed on house arrest. In September 1991, prosecutors apologized to Stallings and dropped the case against her. Stallings said that she lost a lot of weight due to the stress of being imprisoned. She said that her Buddhist faith helped to keep her strong during that time. Aftermath Stallings won a settlement against Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital and the laboratory that tested Ryan's blood. She later said that the perception of her case may have been influenced by the case of Paula Sims, which had unfolded around the same time. In that case, a mother had been tried and convicted of killing her two daughters, and there was considerable public outcry over the murders. In 1994, McElroy ran for reelection as Jefferson County prosecutor, and Stallings donated $10,000 to his opponent, Robert Wilkins. Wilkins won the race. When McElroy offered to show Wilkins his information on the Stallings case, Stallings found out and asked a court to have her arrest record expunged. Some of the information was ordered to be expunged, but a judge said that Missouri law mandated that prosecutors confidentially maintain some of the information related to felony arrests. The Stallings case continues to be cited as an extreme case of a metabolic disorder that mimics a criminal act. Patricia's son, David P. \\"D.J.\\" Stallings, Jr., died in 2013, at the age of 23.

She was launched on July 5, 1873. Her builder and first owner was J.W. \\"flatboat\\" McLane. His ownership was complicated by his British citizenship, since the Alpha would routinely have to cross the US-Canadian boundary while traveling from Grand Forks, Minnesota to Fort Garry, Manitoba. So, she was sold to the Kittison Line. She had a reputation as being one of the fastest vessels in Manitoba, and one capable of proceeding during periods of shallow water, as her draft was just . Running aground did not always end the career of prairie steamboats, but it did end the career of Alpha, when she ran aground on the Assiniboine River in April 1885. Her grounding was due to human error. Her captain took a risk, during flood time. He risked taking a short- cut, by deviating from the river's channel and proceeding across an isythmus that he knew was dry land, during low water. The wreck was left high and dry, when the flood passed. Locals cannibalized some of the ship's fitting and sound lumber. Silt from subsequent floods buried the wreck site, so the exact site was lost. The wreck was re-exposed, in 1958, when that year's flood cut a new channel through the wreck-site.. Her rudder is now housed in a maritime museum in Selkirk, Manitoba.

The partner was bought out during the first few years of the business.Bertman Ballpark Mustard - Official Site - About Us Bertman expanded his sales territory from Cleveland to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After WWII he had negotiated exclusive distribution rights to many food products with a fleet of trucks and a large sales force.

The company sold pickles, salad dressings, spices, coffees, teas, and canned and dried foods products to schools, hospitals, and other large-scale food operations. His company supplied mustard to League Park (then the home of the Cleveland Indians) and the Cleveland Municipal Stadium.

The mustard branded by one of his former employees, Stadium Authentic Mustard, is sold in retail stores, supermarkets, and online, and served in over 150 stadiums and arenas throughout the United States, but not in most Cleveland sports stadiums, where the competing Bertman's Original brand continues to be sold. Cleveland's mustard controversy In 1966, Cleveland had one local brown mustard: Joe Bertman's. David Dwoskin, one of Bertman's sales reps, represented the Bertman brand to retailers throughout Ohio. In 1969, The Davis Food Company partnered with Joe to make \\"The Authentic Stadium Mustard\\" available for retail sales in supermarkets. In 1971, Dwoskin registered the name \\"The Authentic Stadium Mustard\\" for his new company Davis Food Company. In 1982, Davis Food Company obtained exclusive rights to sell to both wholesale and retail markets as well as stadiums, arenas and other venues. In the early 1980s there was a disagreement between Bertman and Dwoskin. Dwoskin produced his own mustard under the Stadium brand through his own company. The Bertman Family continues to sell its version of the mustard through its Bertman Foods Company.http://www.trademarkia.com/the-authentic- stadium-mustard-77564458.html Dwoskin told Cleveland.com that his mustard is served in 150 stadiums in the United States.

Orbit and classification  orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7‚Äì3.0 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,309 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.29 and an inclination of 12¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic.

Physical characteristics  SDSS photometry characterized as a rare and reddish L-type, which belong to the larger complex of stony asteroids.  Slow rotator and tumbler  In September 2014, American astronomer Robert Stephens obtained a rotational lightcurve from photometric observations taken at the Center for Solar System Studies (CS3, ) in California. It gave an exceptionally long rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.55 magnitude (), which makes it one of the slowest rotators known to exist. It is also a suspected tumbling asteroid, which show a non-principal axis rotation.  Diameter and albedo  According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, measures 3.395 and 4.17 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.287 and 0.176, respectively.

Geography  Muckadilla railway station, circa 1920 The town lies in the northern part of the locality. The Western railway line passes through the locality from east to west. The town is serviced by the Muckadilla railway station immediately to the north of the town. The Warrego Highway passes from east to west through the town, mostly being parallel immediately south of the railway line. Muckadilla Creek flows from Mount Bindango to the north down to the south-east of Muckadilla to Mount Abundance, passing just west of the town. The creek becomes Cogoon River and then is a tributary of the Balonne River. The land is mostly 350-400m above sea level and used for grazing and cropping. Some of the slopes of the higher peaks (to 470m) in the south-west of the locality remain densely forested.The former Muckadilla Railway Station, now a tourist centre  History  The name Muckadilla was first used as the creek name, which in turn is believed to be an Aboriginal word (language and dialect unknown) to mean plenty of water. Muckadilla Provisional School opened on 25 January 1886. It was proclaimed Muckadilla State School on 1 January 1909. The school was mothballed at the end of 2008, then closed in 2009. In 1889, the Queensland Government drilled a bore at Muckadilla. Although the water supply found was quite small, it was believed that it had healing properties and people flocked to Muckadilla in search of a cure. Dr E.W.

During systematic excavations since 1992 Middle Paleolithic stone tools and artifacts attributed to the Neanderthal Mousterian culture were discovered among numerous faunal remains. Location Sheltered by the Ardengost limestones which rise to the cave is located at above sea level on the western slopes and overlooks the Neste d'Aure river valley, a tributary of the Garonne. The cave is a sub-horizontal gallery, oriented north to south and its entrance opens towards the south. It is long, in width and in height. Geology The Grotto is entrenched within the Pyrenean Primary Axial Zone as part of the Ardengost limestone massif, that contains a rich microfauna of foraminifera, brachiopods and polyps and floral (algae) elements. The age of this formation was revised during the 2004 excavation based on this paleontological content and re-dated within the Carboniferous from the upper Visean to the Serpukhovian at around 300 Million years ago. The calcareous particles of these organic components supported the formation of micrite mud, a limestone constituent that enabled the development of the local karst.Barr√®re, P., Bouquet, C., Debroas, E.-J., P√©lissonnier, H., Peybern√®s, B., Soul√©, J.-C., Souquet, P. et Ternet, Y. (1984) - Notice explicative de la feuille Arreau √† 1/50 000, √âditions du BRGM, 63 p. Excavations The presence of paleo-human remains in the cave was first suggested in 1898 by Armand Vir√© but only in 1985 it was visited again by caver E. Casteret who reported to the Regional Archaeology Service of the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es department. An initial survey operation was conducted in 1987 under the direction of Michel Allard in order to investigate the extent and impact of decades of illegal levies. Two field sessions in 1992 and 1993 were undertaken to assess the archaeological significance of the site and to determine appropriate protection measures. The subsequent excavation probe of a few square meters lead to the discovery of several cultural layers, relatively rich in Mousterian lithic vestiges and faunal remains and it was determined to permanently protect the site with a strong barred gate at the entrance. This rescue campaigns's results remained mainly unpublished. In a few brief notes the site is usually presented as a temporary occupation site or hunting camp specialized on chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) and ibex (pyrenaica pyrenaica). In 2004, another interdisciplinary research excavation was launched at the site, that lead to a number of new discoveries, in some cases results were contrary to earlier ones. The discovery of juvenile Neanderthal teeth, for example contradicts the hunting camp hypothesis of the site. Dating quartzite and schist 220 px excavation during the summer of 2009 canine of Panthera pardus, scale = flint side-scraper, scale in cm Ardengost village, 17 inhabitants in 2009 Dates, that were obtained by the Carbon-14 dating method indicate a range between of about 30,000 and 50,000 years ago for the entire archaeological sequence. Biochronological data of microfauna and larger animals, similarity association with layers of the Combe-Grenal site allow to propose an allocation of deposits during the interglacial period between the W√ºrm II and W√ºrm III ice ages. Based on AMS radiocarbon dates and biochronological data, the archaeological levels are attributed to a temperate phase of the Oxygen isotope stage 3. Stone tools The stone tool industry of local raw materials from the alluvial formations of the Neste river, such as quartzites, lydites, cinerites, and schists is considered to be of a mediocre quality. Flint, as found in the cultural sediments is naturally absent in the immediate environment and must have been imported from several sources. The most exploited flint quarry is the Montagaillard flysch, located away in the Hibarette community of the Montgaillard region. This flysch flint is of good quality and is found in slabs of different sizes. The presence of Lepidorbitoid fossils in some flints indicates even more distant sources located in the B√©arn province, more than away. Apparently, the flint outcrops of the Petites Pyr√©n√©es to the northeast were not used The tooling is simple and consists mainly of scrapers and denticulates, the execution is often incomplete and irregular. The main production method is the discoid bifacial breakdown. Tools and products of full Levallois debitage, debris, by-products and retouching shards are present in large numbers, as are sandstone and granite hammering tools, although in smaller numbers. The Levallois technique is also attested on quartzite, schist or lydite cutting devices, regular parallel surface products and faceted heels. Noteworthy is the discovery of a two-sided cleaver. Fossils Fauna Noisetier Cave has yielded more than 10,000 fossils of large animals and an additional 80,000 determinable remains of small rodents. Dominant are mountain species, especially chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) and ibex (Capra pyrenaica pyrenaica) followed by deer and large bovines. Moderate amounts of carnivore fossils of cave bear (Ursus spelaeus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), leopard and dhole (Cuon alpinus) are documented. A taphonomic survey concluded distinct types of large animal bone accumulations by different agents. Red deer (Cervus elaphus) and bovine fossils with butchery marks are extremely abundant while carnivore marks are rare. No deer bone is digested while nearly half of the bones show human interference. Neanderthals account for most of the deer and the bovines and a sizable portion of the chamois and ibex fossils, some of them were secondly scavenged by carnivores.. The survey also allows to favor the hypothesis of extraction by Neanderthals of the fat contained in the spongy tissues of deer bones. In chamois assemblages, 482 fossils were investigated and the non-human predation marks interpreted. Bearded vultures (Gypaetus barbatus), that must have occupied the site during Neanderthal's absence accumulated a high percentage of the chamois bones and to a lower degree those of ibex. Dhole (Cuon alpinus) teeth and bones are the most numerous among carnivores. Milk teeth suggest that Cuon alpinus sheltered its offspring at the site. A 2013 study concluded that dholes contributed to the present composition of animal fossils, to which extent remains debated. Microfauna Studies on microfauna, that was very abundant and relatively homogeneous over the entire sequence have, apart from confirming the interglacial climate during the stratigraphic sequence, delivered an independent set of discoveries. From the more than 80,000 remains of rodent species identified, among others were: Arvicola terrestris, Mimomys pyrenaicus, Mimomys pyrenaicus november. sp., Mimomys salpetrierensis, and the Pyrenean desman or muskrat (Galemys pyrena√Øcus). With the discovery of Mimomys salpetrierensis, the former hypothesis of defining the Lower Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene through the disappearance of Mimomys has been called into question. This also applies to other species, such as Pliomys and Allocricetus, which were thought to have become extinct during the Eemian. Another example is the European adder (Vipera berus) which evolved towards the Baskian viper and now occupies the Cantabrian region and the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrena√Øcus), found in fossil form at the site. The European water vole (Arvicola terrestris) retained a local enclave whereas the rest of the population turned towards Asia. Further studies suggested that the Nemausia genus, a nomen nudum is identic with the Mimomys genus. Mimomys pyrenaicus november. sp. was identified as a new species, that supplements the Mimomys lineage between Mimomys salpetrierensis and Mimomys blanci and it also confirms that the Pyrenees served as a refuge for species that are endemic today. Human Remains The site has delivered three dental relics. According to morphological and metric traits, these teeth fit in the variability of Neanderthal. The teeth have a significant attrition of the crown and incomplete roots as those of a 5 to 10-year-old child. Depending on the current variability and the fact that they have been discovered in the same sector and in the same level, they could correspond to the same individual. Character of the site Questions relating to the function of the site are at the heart of the research carried out since 2004. What were the reasons why the Neanderthal groups wanted to frequent the mountain environment? Marked climatic contrasts and important differences in altitude, the mountain environment is generally regarded as constraining for Paleolithic hunter- gatherers groups. The initial hypothesis of a site linked to a hunting camp for mountain game was put into question. Deer is preferentially being hunted, although this species is not typical for a mountain environment. The presence of human juvenile incisors indicates that the site was not exclusively frequented by groups of adult hunters. The questioning of classical interpretation as a halt of hunting poses more questions than it solves and, in the present state of research, the Mousterian occupation of the grotto finds no simple explanation either. It could have served as a temporary habitat site or stage site to travel to the southern slopes of the Pyrenees or for the exploitation of specific mineral resources, but all that remains difficult to demonstrate. In the current state of research, only hypothesis can be proposed to explain the Mousterian occupation of the Noisetier cave.Bernard-Guelle, S.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two dull or pinkish red flowers with prominent dull red markings and with a white labellum with red markings. Description Caladenia denticulata subsp. rubella is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. One or two flowers are borne on a stem high and each flower is long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide at the base, linear to lance-shaped and has a drooping, dark brown, thread-like glandular tip. It is usually dull- to pinkish red, sometimes cream or yellow with prominent dull red markings. The arching lateral sepals and petals are similar in size, shape and colour to the dorsal sepal although the petals are slightly narrower and shorter. The labellum is white with red markings, and curves forward with white to pale red teeth along its margins, the teeth decreasing in size towards the tip. There are up to 13 pairs of anvil-shaped, cream-coloured calli in two rows along about half the length of the labellum and decreasing in size towards the tip. Flowering occurs from August to late September. The dull red or pinkish red colour of the petals and sepals distinguish this from the other subspecies of Caladenia denticulata. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia denticulata was first formally described by John Lindley in 1840 and the description was published in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony.

It is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. Location The building is in downtown Bydgoszcz, on the corner of S≈Çowackiego street and January 20, 1920 street. In the vicinity stand the Pomeranian Philharmonic, the Music School and the Jan Kochanowski Park in Bydgoszcz . History At the Prussian Partition, Bydgoszcz was the capital of the administrative region of the Grand Duchy of Posen as a borough city. After the Prussian administrative reform of 1872, the head of the district was a governor, a civil servant appointed by the King of Prussia. The present Music Academy building was designed as the seat of the district authority. The first two governors had been using their private houses for official duty, dedicating three rooms to office work. But with the growing importance of the administration, the need of a proper building was blatant. The Prussian government hence decided the construction of one building housing all district offices. A competition selecting the project of the building rewarded engineer E. von Saltzwedel from Potsdam. After approval of the blueprint by the municipal construction expert Carl Meyer, on May 24, 1904, a construction permit was issued and work began. Its execution was contracted to M. Czarnikow & Co from Berlin, on an underdeveloped plot located at then 3 Bismarckstrasse (now 7 S≈Çowackiego street). In the same year (1904), a county committee ordered the construction of a coach house and stables on an abutting lot: it is today the library of the Music Academy. During the interwar period, the edifice has housed the headquarters of the Polish district office (), then from 1945 to 1975, the District National Council (). In 1975, thanks to Andrzej Szwalbe, the building was dedicated to educational purposes and underwent several upgrades, so as to accommodate the first Academy of Music, initially as a branch of the Academy of Music in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The overhaul works, which lasted two years, were followed by the first director of Bydgoszcz Academy, Mgr Tadeusz Zfieli≈Ñski. A second step in the renovation of the edifice occurred in 1979. Those works aimed at adapting the interiors for its future pedagogical purposes (e.g. setting up sound-proof walls and doors), while preserving the integrity of the historic elements: they have been carried out by engineer R. Helak and architects H. Sobczyk and J. Szczygielski. Soon the lack of dormitory space became apparent. Some students had to be accommodated in the first year at the school for chemical technics (), in ≈Åukasiewicza street. Others were housed at the hotel PUBR for workers in Toru≈Ñska street and several girls in Bursa N¬∞1, at Bartosza G≈Çowackiego Street. After 1976, the Student Symphony Orchestra performed at several occasions: * a concert commemorating the 150th anniversary of Ludwig van Beethoven's death * the season opening, as an outside concert in \\"Jan Kochanowski\\" Park * a concert of Polish music celebrating the 60th anniversary of Poland's independence The school also invited famous soloists, among whom were Halina Czerny-Stefa≈Ñska, Maria and Kazimierz Wi≈Çkomirski, Piotr Paleczny, Tadeusz ≈ªmudzi≈Ñski, Jerzy Godziszewski, and guests from the Soviet Union, such as the pianist Rudolf Kehrer. A resolution of Ministers Council on November 27, 1979, appointed Bydgoszcz branch of the Academy of Music in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ as Bydgoszcz Music Academy (the 8th in Poland at the time). On December 1, 1981, the school received the patron name of \\"Feliks Nowowiejski\\". Currently the Bydgoszcz Academy of Music comprises four branches: * Faculty of Composition, Theory of Music and Sound Engineering, with Theory of Music and Composition Department of Sound Engineering Department * Faculty of Instrumental Music * Faculty of Vocal Music and Drama * Faculty of Conducting, Jazz Music and Music Education The current director is Jerzy Kaszuba. Building in 1906 Architecture The building presents an eclectic architecture, with a predominance of Neo-Baroque forms, which at the time was a characteristic public buildings. Such style has been also used in the construction of other public buildings, as well as palaces and houses. The front elevation displays an avant-corps, with a richly decorated portal flanked by Doric order columns: it is topped by the motto of the academy, Musica Spiritus Movens, Latin for Music moves the soul. The avant-corps is crowned by the Polish Eagle. All fa√ßades are plastered so as to enhance the effect of decoration made of sandstone, such as the beautiful bay window incorporating many architectural details on the eastern side, or the numerous bossages, pilasters, pediments, arched windows or oeil-de-boeuf. The building is covered with a high mansard roof, with dormers bulging out. The hotel originally served as for official purposes. On the ground were offices. West wing was housing the tax office of the county and in the eastern one were located a meeting hall of the District Committee, as well as District Mayor offices. His private apartment was standing in the northern part of the edifice, and in the attic were also four more rooms for ancillary service. The building possessed a low pressure water heating system, and electrical and gas installations. Today, interiors preserved floorboards and parquet floors, oak staircase and railings, stone columns, as well as paintings and gildings, wood panellings, the rich stuccoed and vaulted ceiling. The edifice was registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List, N¬∞601404 Reg.A/782/1-3, on May 8, 1992.

The ship loses communication with ground control when it enters a dead zone. Alexei defies standing procedure and enters the airlock head first but the outer hatch fails to fully close automatically. He semi deflates his suit and turns within the airlock in order to close the hatch but, as a result, his oxygen runs out and he passes out. Pavel drags him into the pod and succeeds in reviving him. The two are instructed to orbit for 22 hours until Cycle 4 when an automatic system will land them. Pavel detaches the craft from the airlock, causing the Voskhod 2 to spin. Before Cycle 4, Pavel and Alexei feel queasy and find that the oxygen pressure is rising dangerously. Ground control states that the system detected a minor leak and began pumping pure oxygen in response. They are told to find and disconnect a yellow wire in the ceiling to disable it. Pavel passes out from oxygen toxicity, and Alexei takes control, reaching for the wire. The oxygen causes Alexei to hallucinate about his times as a young boy, running in a field, searching for a bird nest. He manages to twist the wire but passes out before it is disconnected. During his hallucination, he remembers reaching out to the bird who injured him, which causes him to flinch and disconnect the wire. The cosmonauts awake to find that Cycle 4 failed to run on schedule and ground control conclude that the spin of the craft may be to blame. The cosmonauts are permitted to use manual mode to re-direct the ship in order to ensure that it lands within the Soviet Union. After Pavel stabilizes the craft, it re- enters the atmosphere and lands in the Ural mountains, far from the expected landing site. Planes are despatched to find them, but their radio signals are not picked up. A radio fan on Sakhalin picks up their signals and eventually notifies the Space Agency of their approximate position. A nearby rescue helicopter is ordered to search for them but cannot find them. The helicopter, running out of fuel, is recalled but, with the cosmonauts close to death, the crew spot Alexei's flare. The cosmonauts arrive by plane at the Agency to meet with their wives and children. Later they parade through Moscow where huge crowds cheer them.

Two- thirds of the film were directed by Yuri Bykov, but he was fired from the project by producers Timur Bekmambetov and Yevgeny Mironov. After this, Dmitry Kiselev continued work on the film. Alexei Leonov himself became consultant of the picture. Visual effects were made by CGF, Russia's largest visual effects studio. CGF worked on more than 1,200 computer graphics shots of varying complexity. Principal photography finished at the end of 2016. Reception Box office The Age of Pioneers grossed RUB 145 million in its first weekend, below early expectations. It was attributed to unsuccessful marketing campaign. However, movie's second weekend drop was very small ‚Äì less than 15%, as it grossed additional RUB 124 million due to good word of mouth.

Like her mother, she moves easily between the realms of graphic arts and textiles. Eight of her prints were part of the first print edition from Baker Lake, in 1970, and her pieces have appeared in many collections since then. Her work is informed by some of the stylistic tropes of European art.

As such it is used to treat warts, calluses, psoriasis, dandruff, acne, ringworm, and ichthyosis. For conditions other than warts, it is often used together with other medications. It is applied to the area affected. Side effects include skin irritation, and salicylate poisoning. Salicylate poisoning tends to only occur when applied to a large area and in children. Use is thus not recommended in children less than two years old. It comes in a number of different strengths. Salicylic acid has been in medical use since at least the time of Hippocrates. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. In the United Kingdom 10 ml of a 17% liquid formulation costs the NHS about ¬£1.71. It is also available mixed with coal tar, zinc oxide, or benzoic acid. Medical uses Salicylic acid as a medication is used to help remove the outer layer of the skin. As such it is used to treat warts, calluses, psoriasis, dandruff, acne, ringworm, and ichthyosis. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in some shampoos to treat dandruff. In modern medicine, salicylic acid and its derivatives are constituents of some \\"skin-reddening\\" products. Side effects Concentrated solutions of salicylic acid may cause hyperpigmentation on people with darker skin types (Fitzpatrick phototypes IV, V, VI), without a broad spectrum sunblock. Due to sun sensitivity, sun protection is recommended when using salicylic acid on sun-exposed skin. Pregnancy No studies examine topical salicylic acid in pregnancy. The risks of aspirin late in pregnancy are probably not relevant for a topical exposure to salicylic acid, even late in the pregnancy, because of its low systemic levels. Topical salicylic acid is common in many over-the-counter dermatological agents and the lack of adverse reports suggests a low risk.Acne and Pregnancy . Fetal-exposure.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-03. Overdose Side effects include skin irritation, and salicylate poisoning. Salicylate poisoning tends to only occur when applied to a large area and in children. Use is thus not recommended in children less than two years old. It comes in a number of different strengths. Salicylic acid overdose can lead metabolic acidosis with compensatory respiratory alkalosis. In people presenting with an acute overdose, a 16% morbidity rate and a 1% mortality rate are observed. Mechanism of action Salicylic acid works as a keratolytic, comedolytic and bacteriostatic agent, causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again and allowing room for new cell growth. History Historically salicylic acid is known for its ability to ease aches and pains and reduce fevers. These medicinal properties, particularly fever relief, were discovered in ancient times. It has been also used as an anti-inflammatory drug.

In Stilling the lake is also known as Stilling Lake, in Solbjerg it is known as Solbjerg Lake and in Fregerslev it is known as Fregerslev Lake. Stilling-Solbjerg Lake and the areas around it are a protected area. The area includes the lake and the valley Pilbrodalen. It was protected in 1964 and 1965 by the Danish Nature Agency. The lake is not freely accessible from all directions but there are large recreational areas with jetties and benches by the lake in both Stilling and Solbjerg. From the north side the lake is accessible from S√∏g√•rde and from the south side Restaurant Stilling S√∏ lies by the shore. The lake is home to the training facilities for Skanderborg Vandski Klub (Skanderborg Water Ski Club)-  Legends  There are a number of myths and legends associated with the lake and its surroundings. One of the more recent is from the Torstensson War against Sweden from 1643 to 1645. It was said that the generals of king Christian IV always travelled with a chest of silver to pay for mercenaries. In the winter of 1643-1644, Skanderborg Castle was besieged by Swedish forces and a group of Danish soldiers attempted to secure the silver and bring it to Aarhus. However, the soldiers were discovered by a group of Swedish soldiers and the Danes then made a hole in the ice and, while under fire, dropped the contents of the chest into the lake to prevent the Swedes from getting hold of it.  Environmental conditions  Stilling-Solbjerg Lake is characterized by high levels of calcium and is categorized as a lake type 10 in the Danish lake classification system. Bathing is allowed and deemed safe and Stilling Beach Park is a Blue Flag beach.Teknisk baggrundsnotat til Vandplan 1.7 √Örhus Bugt, Bilag 3.1Skanderborg Kommune (marts 2012): Badevandsprofil for Stilling badebro, Solbjerg-Stilling s√∏, Skanderborg Kommune og ALECTIA A/S The lake suffers from high levels of chlorophyll, in the 2010s some 2.5 times higher than the ideal target. There has previously been pollution with especially phosphorus and nitrogen from both agriculture and untreated wastewater from residential areas. The problems have abated since the 1980s due to an active effort on part of the bordering municipalities. The level of agricultural runoff has decreased dramatically but the level of phosphorus remains largely unchanged due to accumulation in the lake sediment. In August and September there's usually some degree of cyanobacterial growth and algal blooms.Teknisk baggrundsnotat til Vandplan 1.7 √Örhus Bugt, Afsnit 3 s. 13 Stilling-Solbjerg Lake has a diverse flora and fauna. There are 13 registered species of vegetation, although coverage is only some 2% of the lake bottom and it is unstable due to the high levels of phosphorus and nitrogen. There are a total of 10 fish species including pike, rudd, roach, bream, perch, Zander, European eel, gasterosteiformes and burbot. The dominating species are roach and perch while Zander is well established.

It launched in 2013 and has published works exploring an alternate economic and social model for Scotland. It contributed to the debates that were occurring as part of the Scottish independence referendum, aligned to the Yes campaign. Originally part of the Jimmy Reid Foundation, it became a separate entity in October 2014. After the referendum it continued to develop and publish material and supports an independent media outlet which launched in 2015. The organisation is not affiliated to any political party. The director is Robin McAlpine. History Common Weal launched May 2013 as part of the Jimmy Reid Foundation. A group of academics and economists proposed a model based on co-operation and mutual benefit, attempting to avoid social exclusion. The following month, further work from the project cautioned against proposals of monetary union between an independent Scotland and the rest of the UK. In July 2013, McAlpine was invited to present the project's economic concepts to the First Minister and the SNP's 65 MSPs. A few months later a conference of SNP councillors showed some support for the ideas around fairness within society. The concepts had also been scheduled for discussion at conferences organised by Radical Independence Campaign and the Scottish Green Party. By the end of the year they had a new website and a distinctive look. On 1 June 2014, Common Weal launched a 180-page book that drew upon policies from Germany and Scandinavia. This explored an economy with the features of highly skilled workforce receiving high wages within a 30-hour working week. Common Weal had developed its own identity and in October 2014 it split from the Jimmy Reid Foundation and became an independent organisation. In October 2015 they published a book, 101 ideas to transform Scotland. In October 2016, they ran an event in Glasgow that coincided with the Scottish National Party conference. This unofficial fringe event included around 40 organisations and was intended as a place for less mainstream ideas to be discussed. It funds an independent news service, CommonSpace, which launched in January 2015.

Theoretical predictions for the flux of the DSNB on Earth are difficult as they depend on many different parameters and assumptions e.g. the rate of supernovae events in the Universe as a function of time, the star formation rate and the neutrino spectrum from each supernova. However even given these uncertainties the DSNB flux should not be more than an order of magnitude below the current experimental bound, and so will be detectable in the near future.

It has entered the Mediterranean Sea from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal as a Lessepesian migrant and is now an important species in the fisheries of the eastern Mediterranean. Description Sphyraena chrysotaenia has a very elongated, torpedo-shaped body, typical of the barracudas, with two well- separated dorsal fins, the first dorsal fin has with five spiny rays, with the first ray being the longest, the rays then progressively decrease in size posteriorly. The second dorsal fin has its origin in front of the origin of the anal fin. The tail is markedly forked. The pectoral fin sits directly below the origin of the first dorsal fin with the pelvic fin below it. The large head is conical with a large eye, pointed snout and slightly projecting lower jaw. The jaws and palate are lines with large canine shaped teeth which vary in size. The small scales are cycloid in form and the lateral line is almost straight. The preoperculum is covered in scales and its lower posterior margin is concave. They are coloured brown-grey above and silvery below, a dusky stripe runs from the snout through centre of the eye, above the base of the pectoral fin to base of the tail, this stripe may show a yellowish tint on the head. The distal portion of first dorsal and caudal fins is blackish, the second dorsal, pectoral and base of the caudal fins are yellowish. They have been recorded up to 32 cm standard length but average 20‚Äì25 cm. Distribution Sphyraena chrysotenia has an Indo-West Pacific distribution occurring from the Red Sea and Madagascar east through the Indian Ocean to China and northern Australia. It was first recorded in the Mediterranean off Palestine in 1931, and had spread as far west as Malta by 1993 and north to the southern Adriatic Sea by 2002. It has been misidentified as Sphyraena obtusata but this species has not been recorded from the Mediterraean. Biology Sphyraena chrysotenia forms large schools in inshore waters in the pelagic and demersal zones to a depth of 50m. It is piscivorous, catching its food near the bottom and feeds mainly on schooling fish such as Sardinella aurita and Engraulis encrasicolus, but will also feed on crustaceans. The spawning season in the Mediterranean runs from April to September, or August to November in the central Mediterranean and the eggs and fry are planktonic, the juveniles are often recorded in very shallow waters. S. chrysotaenia is a relatively short-lived species with a maximum age of 5 years old. S. chrysotaenia reaches sexual maturity at a total length of 195mm for females and 197.1mm for males, usually at 2 years old. An analysis of the parasites of Sphyraena chrysotenia in the Mediterranean showed that the fish, after its invasion of this Sea, lost at least two parasite species, co-introduced three parasite species and acquired six native parasite species from its native congener Sphyraena sphyraena. Fisheries Sphyraena chrysotenia is now the most common species of barracuda caught by artisanal fisheries in Lebanon, outnumbering the other landed species by 70%. It can be caught in considerable quantities in inshore waters using purse-seine nets, gillnets and by trawling. It was first recorded in the Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia in 2002 and now forms an important part of the total fishery. In the Gulf of Suez studies showed indications of overexploitation of the stock as fish being landed were too small to be sexually mature.

It is an erect shrub which multiples asexually from root suckers and has three-part, clover-like leaves and clusters of white to pink flowers with four petals and four stamens. Description Zieria covenyi is an erect shrub which usually grows to a height of and only reproduces from root suckers. It has star-shaped hairs on its branches and leaves, at least when they are young. The leaves are arranged in opposite pairs and are composed of three leaflets with the central one heart-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide and with a petiole long. The leaflets are dark green with small oil glands on the upper surface and grey-green with soft hairs on the lower surface. White to pale pink flowers, in diameter are arranged in clusters of between 3 and 21 in leaf axils. The clusters are about the same length as the leaves. The sepals are triangular, about long and covered with soft hairs. The four petals are about long, overlap each other and have a layer of hairs on the outside and there are four stamens. Flowering occurs from October to December and although insects have been observed visiting the flowers they have not carried fertile pollen from this species and fruit has not been recorded. Taxonomy and naming Covenyi's zieria was first formally described in 2002 by James Andrew Anderson from a specimen collected near Bomaderry Creek. The description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (covenyi) honours the Australian herbarium collector, Robert George Coveny who, with James Armstrong, collected the type specimen. Distribution and habitat Zieria covenyi is only known from two populations totalling about 270 plants on Narrow Neck Peninsula in the Blue Mountains, where it grows in sandy soil in eucalypt woodland. Conservation Covenyi's zieria is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. Some of the threats to the species are habitat damage due to road maintenance, frequent fires and the inability of the species to reproduce from seed.

For cyanide poisoning it is often used after the medication sodium nitrite and typically only recommended for severe cases. It is either given by injection into a vein or applied to the skin. Side effects may include vomiting, joint pain, mood changes, psychosis, and ringing in the ears. Safety, however, has not been well studied. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Use at the same time in the same intravenous line as hydroxocobalamin is not recommended. In cyanide poisoning sodium nitrite creates methemoglobinemia which removes cyanide from mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate then binds with cyanide creating the nontoxic thiocyanate. Sodium thiosulfate came into medical use for cyanide poisoning in the 1930s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The cost in the United States per dose as of 2013 is about US$20 while together with sodium nitrite it costs US$110. Medical uses The main use of sodium thiosulfate is in cyanide poisoning and pityriasis versicolor. Cyanide poisoning Sodium thiocyanate is a classical antidote to cyanide poisoning, For this purpose it is used after the medication sodium nitrite and typically only recommended for severe cases. It is given by injection into a vein. In this use, sodium nitrite creates methemoglobinemia which removes cyanide from mitochondria. Sodium thiosulfate then serves as a sulfur donor for the conversion of cyanide to the nontoxic thiocyanate, catalyzed by the enzyme rhodanase. The thiocyanate is then safely excreted in the urine. There are concerns that sodium thiosulfate may not have a fast enough onset of action to be very useful for this use without the additional use of other agents. In cases with both cyanide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning, sodium thiosulfate by itself is recommended. Hemodialysis There is a small amount of evidence supporting the use of sodium thiosulfate to counteract calciphylaxis, the calcification of blood vessels that may occur in hemodialysis patients with end-stage kidney disease. However, it has been claimed that this treatment may cause severe metabolic acidosis in some patients. Sodium thiosulfate has been observed to help in the treatment of a rare systemic fibrosis condition caused by gadolinium-based contrast media in patients with kidney failure. The compound can also be used to measure the volume of extracellular body fluid and the renal glomerular filtration rate. Fungal infections of the skin Foot baths of sodium thiosulfate are used for prophylaxis of ringworm. It is also used as a topical antifungal agent for tinea versicolor (pityriasis versicolor), possibly in combination with salicylic acid; and for other fungal infections of the skin. Side effects  Side effects may include vomiting, joint pain, mood changes, psychosis, and ringing in the ears. Safety; however, has not been well studied. It is unclear if use in pregnancy is safe for the baby. Use at the same time in the same intravensous line as hydroxocobalamin is not recommended.

She was the editor of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) publications Rights and Reviews and CORE Magazine in the early 1970s and again in the 1980s. She was the sister of former CORE chairman Clarence Funnye, and the former wife of CORE National chairman Roy Innis. Early life Doris Valdena Funnye was born on February 26, 1933, in Georgetown, South Carolina, the daughter of Susan (n√©e Green) and John A. Funnye, a minister. She was raised in a Southern Baptist family and was the only sister of three brothers. One of her brothers, Clarence Delmonte Funnye, an Air Force veteran of the Korean War, would later become the Chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality from 1964 to 1965. Doris Funnye attended Howard High School in Georgetown, and later obtained degrees from South Carolina State College, as well as two master's degrees from New York University, one in English (B.A.) and one in Education (B.A.Ed.). CORE years Doris Funnye followed her brother Clarence to the Congress of Racial Equality as a volunteer and organizer for the civil rights organization. Not long after entering CORE she met a young chemist named Roy Innis, and the two were married in 1965. Roy Innis often stated anecdotally, \\"Doris was always busy with this place called CORE. So I followed her there. They tried to kick me out saying meetings were for CORE staff members only. So, I became a staff member.\\" Though Roy Innis entered CORE through Doris Funnye as a volunteer, he usurped her brother Clarence as Chairman of CORE helping to issue in a new phase of Black Nationalism. The friction between Roy Innis and Clarence Funnye put a strain on Doris in terms of her relationships with her older brother and spouse. Congress of Racial Equality Magazine, Fall 1975 - feature on integration and education By 1966 Doris Innis was the editor of the CORE publication Rights and Reviews, which featured writings from Julian Bond, Roy Innis and then national chairman Floyd McKissick. The magazine often featured artwork from artists such as Osmond Tyner and contributions from satirist-cartoonist Jules Feiffer. While she was at CORE, Innis was a contributing writer to Life magazine, writing a review of the 1968 CBS News series, Of Black America. In the 1970s Innis became the editor of CORE Magazine. The in-house published magazine focused on Black empowerment, featuring articles on international and national politics, education, economics, arts, culture, literature, sports and media. Innis often interviewed noteworthy African American females of the time, such as Eleanor Holmes Norton and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. On the occasion of interviewing Chisolm, Innis used the pen name Penda Saxby. Roy Innis, Jomo Kenyatta, and Doris Funnye Innis in Kenya, circa 1970 Innis accompanied her husband Roy on many official CORE delegations, notably, delegations to Africa in 1971 and 1973 where she met with leaders such as Kenya's Jomo Kenyatta and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania. In 1971 she led the Women in the Black Society Workshop which covered topics such as the treatment of Black women by Black men, women's liberation, birth control, and inter-racial relationships. In attendance were Shirley Chisholm and Nina Simone who received lifetime CORE memberships at the event. Innis headed the CORE delegation to Mexico City for the first World Conference on Women in 1975 (dubbed International Women's Year by the United Nations). In 1976, Innis edited the book, Profiles in Black, a compilation book of 100 biographical sketches of \\"Living Black Unsung Heroes\\". The book featured African Americans of noteworthy accomplishments in arts, politics, engineering, media and music. Opera singer Claudia Lindsey (a close friend of Innis) was featured in the book. Break from CORE By the late 1970s a strained relationship with Roy Innis made it increasingly difficult for Doris to actively work within the offices of the Congress of Racial Equality. By 1980, she began to distance herself from CORE. However, she continued to assist Roy in his urban education programs, such as the CORE Community School in the Bronx, New York as a senior administrator at the school. In 1981 Doris Innis was a contributor to the New York Times, writing an article about the tradition of the church dinner with African-American churches in Harlem. Innis began work as an editor with the magazine Woman's World. Following a scandal surrounding Roy Innis, Doris was called into the head office, where she was asked if she had any relation to him. Though the two were separated by this time, she informed her employer that Roy was still her husband. Not wanting to bring unwanted attention to their publication, Woman's World terminated Doris Innis' employment. The termination, compounded with her conflicts with Roy Innis, was emotionally devastating to Doris, affecting her confidence to seek work with high-profile publishers from then on. Post-CORE years Doris Innis used the 1980s to compose herself and concentrate on raising her only child, Kimathi. She found work as a teacher in the New York public education system for several years before landing work with Park Row Publishing as an editor in medical publishing. Roy Innis made attempts to bring Doris back to CORE, but she kept her distance. She assisted CORE on two of its last magazines, one being the new publication, The Correspondent. She declined to take editorial credit for both publications. By the 2000s Doris had semi-retired from editing but was a frequent contributing writer to South Carolina's Georgetown Times. She had since moved back to South Carolina to be closer to her mother. Death Doris Innis died in her New York home at the age of 82.

A graduate of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania, Yarros resided at Hull House for many years and opened the second birth control clinic in the nation there. She was an obstetrician/gynecologist affiliated with the University of Illinois at Chicago and the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. Yarros' social causes included assisting with the founding of the American Social Hygiene Association and founding the first premarital and marital counseling service in the United States. Yarros was married to journalist and anarchist Victor Yarros. Late in life, she left Chicago for Florida and then California, dying of heart problems in San Diego. Early life Rachelle Slobodinsky was born into a wealthy family in Berdychiv, a city near Kiev. Her parents were Joachim and Bernice Slobodinsky. Joining a subversive political organization when she was 13, Slobodinsky found herself gaining attention from Czarist police when she was 17, and her parents gave her enough money to escape to the United States. She fled to New York, where she got a job sewing at a sweatshop. She later moved to Boston, where she met her future husband, Victor Yarros. He was a Russian immigrant, journalist and anarchist. Career In 1890, Slobodinsky became the first woman admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons in Boston. Attending a year of medical school there, Slobodinsky graduated from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1893. She married Victor Yarros in 1894. She completed postgraduate training at the New England Hospital for Women and Children, the New York Infirmary for Infants and Children and Michael Reese Hospital. Yarros and her husband moved to Chicago, where Yarros established a practice as an obstetrician/gynecologist and became a volunteer faculty member at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Yarros was deeply affected by the suicide of one of her patients. A young woman had become pregnant and had been abandoned by her fianc√©, and she was afraid of the ramifications that pregnancy would have for her career as a business supervisor. The woman saw Yarros in her office and begged for an abortion, but abortion was illegal and Yarros refused to perform one. The woman committed suicide on Lake Michigan that day. Yarros hoped that contraception and sex education would eliminate the need for abortions. Though some birth control advocates of the time supported the notion of eugenics, Yarros did not. Yarros was on the UIC faculty until 1928, becoming an associate professor, and she served as an associate director of the Chicago Lying-in Hospital. Between 1907 and 1927, Rachelle and Victor Yarros resided at Hull House, where residents were heavily involved in social reform movements. Among the residents at Hull House was Yarros' friend Alice Hamilton. They had become friends during their internship in Boston. In the 1910s, Yarros was a member of the Chicago Women's Club and she encouraged them to establish a birth control committee which evolved into the Illinois Birth Control League. For many years, Yarros was the director of the Illinois Birth Control League. With the encouragement of Margaret Sanger, Yarros opened a birth control clinic at Hull House. It was the second such clinic in the United States. The clinic, which provided married females with diaphragms, faced criticism from Chicago's health commissioner, Herman N. Bundesen. However, similar clinics were established across the city in a short time. An advocate for sexually informed women, Yarros wrote Modern Woman and Sex in 1933, which was reissued a few years later as Sex Problems in Modern Marriage. She was one of the founders of the American Social Hygiene Association (ASHA) and she served as the first vice-president of the Illinois Social Hygiene League. As an arm of the latter organization, Yarros founded the nation's first premarital and marital counseling clinic. Even most of the membership of the ASHA supported eugenics, so they did not fully consider the sex education needs of minorities. Compounding the problem, as people realized that American soldiers were returning from World War I infected with syphilis, they were focused on emphasizing sex education for white men. Yarros believed in and campaigned for sex education for women and minorities. \\"Experiences of a Lecturer\\", one such speech that was delivered to the ASHA membership in 1918, was later published in the journal Social Hygiene. Later life In the late 1930s, Yarros moved to Winter Park, Florida. She moved again in 1941, this time to La Jolla, California. She maintained some involvement in social and civic causes even late in life, chairing the Russian Relief Committee of La Jolla and serving as vice-president of the San Diego Social Hygiene Association. Victor Yarros, who had at one time been a law partner of Clarence Darrow, lived until 1956. They had one adopted daughter named Elise. Yarros died in San Diego in 1946 of heart failure; she had suffered a heart attack several years earlier. Her obituary quoted a passage from an unpublished autobiography, which said that \\"the enlightened, socially minded doctor will sympathize with labor, with victims of exploitation and industrial autocracy, with the juvenile and adult delinquents who are the products of slums and blighted, ugly, depressing districts. He will work and fight for ripe and genuine reforms.\\" References 1869 births 1946 deaths People from Berdychiv American obstetricians University of Illinois at Chicago faculty Birth control activists 19th-century American women physicians 19th- century American physicians 20th-century American women physicians 20th-century American physicians Ukrainian emigrants to the United States Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania alumni Physicians from Illinois ","title":"Rachelle Yarros"},{"id":"52880083","title":"List of natural monuments of Turkey"},{"id":"52880103","text":"A number of steamships were named Athelstane, including- * , a cargo ship in service 1872‚Äì92 * , a tanker in service 1935‚Äì42 * , a tanker in service 1922‚Äì26 * , a coastal tanker in service 1928‚Äì35 * , a tanker in service 1941‚Äì45 Ship names ","title":"SS Athelstane"},{"id":"52880105","text":"Rachel Helleur is a British cellist and member of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.

It is only recommended in severe cases of cyanide poisoning. In those who have both cyanide poisoning and carbon monoxide poisoning sodium thiosulfate by itself is usually recommended. It is given by slow injection into a vein. Side effects can include low blood pressure, headache, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness, and vomiting. Greater care should be taken in people with underlying heart disease. People's levels of methemoglobin should be regularly checked during treatment. While not well studied during pregnancy, there is some evidence of potential harm to the baby. Sodium nitrite is believed to work by creating methemoglobin that then binds with cyanide and thus removes it from the mitochondria. Sodium nitrite came into medical use in the 1920s and 1930s.

The original school building was built in 1930, while the current gym/auditorium was constructed as an LDS chapel in 1939. There are also two more recent constructions consisting of modular buildings, which are not considered as contributing to the historical nature of the site. History The schoolhouse was constructed as a two-room schoolhouse in 1930. It had been preceded by four earlier schoolhouses. The first schoolhouse was a 20 foot by 20 foot log construction built in 1882. This structure was expanded to 40 by 20 in 1885. This remained the town's only schoolhouse until the mid-1910s, when it was accidentally burned down by two students. A second structure, this one of wood frame, was constructed at a cost of $4,000 in 1916‚Äì17, and opened in the fall of 1917. The structure contained two classrooms, a stage, and a recreation hall. With a capacity of 300 people, it could hold more than the total population of the town. Lightning struck the building in 1919, resulting in a fire which burned the school to the ground. A temporary structure, again of rough-hewn timber was constructed to handle classes beginning in 1920. In addition to holding classes, all three of these buildings were also used for town meetings as well as religious services. In 1930 the town spent $4,800 to construct the current stone schoolhouse, which opened for classes in the fall. The building consisted of two classrooms and two cloakrooms. Two outhouses were in the building's rear. The structure was of concrete foundation and red limestone walls; the limestone came from a quarry approximately three miles south of the town. One of the classrooms held class for grades 1 through 4, while the other conducted classes for grades 5 through 8. During the 1930s the enrollment varied between the high 20s and low 40s. Upon finishing eighth grade, any students wishing to attend high school were bussed to Round Valley High School, about 20 miles to the north in Eagar. During the 1930s the schoolhouse was also the township's meeting hall, as well as hosting many different functions, activities and both public and private events. It also served as the community's LDS church. During the 1940s the outhouses were replaced by interior restrooms and indoor plumbing. The growth of the community saw the need for a chapel for the LDS ward. Alexander & Burton designed the building, and construction on the chapel began in 1938, handled by the construction firm of C. Bryant Whiting of nearby Springerville. The same red limestone as the schoolhouse was used for the chapel. Crude blocks were quarried, than transported to the site by horse-drawn wagons, where they were finished by local workmen, who were supervised by an Italian stonemason. Wood for the interior was supplied from Forest Service lands, a total of 150,000 board-feet was processed at a local sawmill owned by a Bishop of the LDS church. The milled arches at the front entry, along with other decorative elements were created using a wheeled bandsaw. Whiting completed the construction on time in the Spring of 1939, and came in under budget, costing less than $17,000. The first use of the structure was by the Relief Society, which held a meeting on April 30, 1939. With its larger meeting room, it replaced the schoolhouse as the community's meeting hall, as well as religious center. According to some accounts, the two-room schoolhouse is the oldest school building in Apache County to see continuous use. In December 1972, due to declining membership, the LDS ward was dissolved. In 1987 the Alpine Elementary School District acquired the former chapel, and combined it with the schoolhouse, to be used as a multipurpose room and gymnasium. In addition to its scholastic activities, the chapel continues to be used for community events and meetings. Structure The complex consists of several buildings: two older stone structures, the schoolhouse built in 1930 and the former chapel (now used as a gym/multipurpose room) built in 1938‚Äì39; and two more modern pre-fabricated modular buildings which were erected in the mid to late 1970s. School building Alpine Elementary School The school is a one-story building with a concrete foundation and red limestone walls of ashlar construction. The corners of the building contain quoins of white limestone, and the roof is galvanized sheet metal. There are two entries to the building, on the east and west sides of the building. The main entry lies to the east, with the rear entry to the west. Both entries have double wooden doors inside of which is a vestibule adorned with stone piers with concrete arches. The schoolhouse architecture is of no particular singular style. American Craftsman and Bungalow style can be seen in the decorative wooden shingles below the gable ends, three-light panel doors, and knee braces; Romanesque Revival style is seen in the rounded arches of the two entries. Originally, the interior consisted of two classrooms and a coatroom. In the 1940s the external outhouses were replaced with the installation of internal plumbing and two restrooms. The classrooms are divided by a sliding wooden partition. The original wood-burning stoves used to heat the structure have since been replaced by central heating. Neither the architect or builder is known. Former chapel Old LDS chapel on Alpine Elementary School grounds The gymnasium is a one and half story building with an asymmetrical floorplan and cross-gabling. Like the schoolhouse, it has a concrete foundation, although it has a partial basement. Like the school, it has dressed limestone walls set in a random ashlar pattern, but differs from the school in that the limestone is white, rather than red. Its roof is made of composition shingles. The front of the building has a recessed porch supported by wooden arches; its front door has solid batten construction with wrought-iron hinges. Decorative Stick style flourishes can be found at the front entry, and both the east and west gable ends. Other decorative touches include notched rafter ends on each eve, as well as the dormer roof. Most of the building's windows are of the metal casement style with wooden sashes, original to the structure, except for one which has been replaced by a modern aluminum slider. Front door of former chapel The original assembly room of the chapel became the school's auditorium and gymnasium, the original flooring replaced by maple hardwood, to serve as the surface for a basketball court. The former church office was redone to become a kindergarten room, and two smaller rooms were combined to become the home economics classroom, which also doubles as the school's cafeteria. An interior restroom has also been added. Alexander & Burton were the architects of the chapel. They designed several LDS churches during the 1930s and 1940s, including the Phoenix LDS Third Ward Chapel and the LDS church in St. Johns, both built in 1938. The chapel was built by C. Bryant Whiting, a Springerville contractor, and its successful completion led to his success as a contractor. Other buildings Originally, there were two outhouses to the rear of the school building, but they were removed when interior plumbing and restrooms were installed in the 1940s. Between 1976‚Äì79 two prefabricated modular buildings were constructed behind the schoolhouse, in order to increase the capacity of the school. One of the modules houses the school's offices and a music room, while the other contains the library and a learning library.

Developed by the University of Tokyo, the spacecraft is a low- cost 3U CubeSat, with a goal of realizing future cost-competitive nanosatellites in the global market by using domestic commercial products. Overview TRICOM-1R was built based on the 'Hodoyoshi Reliability Engineering' demonstrated by the Hodoyoshi 3 and 4 microsatellites. It was built by the University of Tokyo Intelligent Space Systems Laboratory, with funding allocated from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The store and forward mission involved the satellite storing weak signal data from terrestrial terminals, and forwarding the data when the satellite flies above ground stations. TRICOM-1R will also conduct Earth observation using its main camera and five sub cameras. The name of the spacecraft is partially based on the Japanese word , which means 'to take in', due to the store and forward nature of the mission. Launch TRICOM-1R was successfully placed into orbit on 3 February 2018. TRICOM-1 TRICOM-1R was a re-flight of the TRICOM-1 CubeSat. On 14 January 2017 23:33:00, the SS-520-4 three stage sounding rocket was launched from Uchinoura Space Center carrying TRICOM-1. 20 seconds after launch, contact was lost with the telemetry transmitter on board the rocket, and the command to ignite the second stage was not sent. The rocket then flew in a sub-orbital trajectory, reaching a maximum altitude of approximately . TRICOM-1 is believed to have crashed into the Pacific Ocean with its launcher. Despite loss of telemetry from the rocket, the satellite was automatically released from the rocket around the time it was scheduled to, and ground stations were able to briefly receive telemetry from the satellite.

The Cambridge Dictionary lists decolonization as \\"the process in which a country that was previously a colony (i.e. controlled by another country) becomes politically independent.\\" However, this definition does not capture the agency of the \\"masses\\", as Frantz Fanon referred to them, and their role in this process. Fanon's ideas regarding the agency involved in shaping one's own path reflects the notion that \\"decolonization can only happen when the native takes up his or her responsible subjecthood and refuses to occupy the position of violence-absorbing passive victim.\\" Specifically in the context of higher education in South Africa, decolonization represents a further dismantling of western centered institutions, systems, symbolism, and standards within the higher education system. It goes beyond just filling the void left by colonialism and Apartheid with the presence of marginalized bodies, and promotes the decolonization of the purpose and functions of higher education itself.  Context   Higher Education created in a Colonial and Apartheid Context (1910-1994)  Engaging colonialism‚Äôs, and subsequently Apartheid‚Äôs, mark on South Africa‚Äôs higher education system is instrumental to understanding the policies and reports subsequently created to remedy the inequalities that manifested as a result of these systems. Of particular notice in the long and varied history of higher education in South Africa, is the period after the establishment of the country in 1910. With the 1913 Natives Land Act, South Africa was legally segregated; black people were indigenized and pushed out onto reserves. After the Afrikaner Nationalist Party won the 1948 General Election, the policy of Apartheid began with force. The government continued the indigenization of indigenous Africans through the \\"Policy of Separate Development\\"‚Äîthe dividing up of Africans by tribe‚Äîand the creation of ‚ÄúBantu groups‚Äù, who were each given their own homelands or Bantustans‚Äîwhich were separate nations. The policy of Apartheid impacted every aspect of black life: where they lived; where they worked; and even where, what and how they learned. Each of the Bantustans had their own universities (designated by the Bantu Education Act of 1958), and South Africa as a whole had divided the higher education system along color lines. There were 11 universities reserved for and serving mainly white people; 5 of which were Afrikaans, 4 were English and two were bilingual. Indians‚Äîalong with some colored people‚Äîwere designated to attend the University of Durban- Westville‚Äîwho defiantly opened their doors to all races in 1984‚Äîand Colored people were designated to attend the University of the Western Cape. Those educated at the University of the Western Cape received an education that was primarily focused on imparting vocational and technical skills for low to medium level jobs. In the Bantustans, universities were built and maintained with the primary objective of teaching black people technical skills for fields like agriculture, commercial and industry, military and health. Since high skilled and high paying jobs were secured for whites, they were limited to low level positions within the Bantustans. After wide protests against Bantu education in 1976 and the Soweto uprising‚Äîwhich resulted in the deaths of 87 school children‚Äîin 1977, the Apartheid government implemented the Education and Training Act of 1979. This repealed the Bantu Education Act of 1953 and the Bantu Special Education Act of 1964. The Education and Training Act was passed with the intent of appeasing blacks and turning the tides of protests. However, the act did not do much to change the system of education for black South Africans and South Africans of color; universities continued to be segregated and subpar education and low level training continued to be reserved for these non-white populations.  Higher Education under Transformation  With the election of the new government in 1994, particular policies were passed to correct the damage of Apartheid in the realm of education; the most noteworthy of these were the White Paper, the Higher Education Act 101, and the National Plan for Higher Education on the national scale as well as university specific Transformation policies. = Transformation Laws = The ‚ÄúWhite Paper 3: A Programme for the Transformation of higher education‚Äù was a report documenting South Africa‚Äôs transition from Apartheid and minority rule to a democracy. The White Paper notes higher education as playing a ‚Äúcritical role in the social, cultural and economic development of modern societies‚Äù. It lays out specific initiatives to transform higher education based on the principles of: equity and redress; democratization; development; quality; effectiveness and efficiency; academic freedom; institutional autonomy; and public accountability. Its goals at the national level were to ‚Äúconceptualize, plan, govern and fund higher education in South Africa as a single, coordinated system‚Äù and through that system push forward diversity and equity programs that aimed to ‚Äúprovide advanced educational opportunities for an expanding population‚Äù. At the institutional level, the report called for the ‚Äú[transformation] and [democratization of] the governance structures of higher education‚Äù in an effort to allow for the various ‚Äústakeholders who recognize different identities, interests and freedoms‚Äù to also pursue a cooperative and coordinated goal. The Higher Education Act 101 of 1997 was passed to regulate higher education and specifically to ‚Äúprovide the establishment, composition and functions of a council on Higher education‚Äù as well as ‚Äúto provide for transitional arrangements‚Äù in higher education. It mandated ‚Äúrestructure and transform programs and institutions‚Äù that would better respond to the needs of South Africa as well as redress past inequalities, provide equalized opportunity. The National Plan for Higher Education was passed in February 2001 and the goal was to shape the implementation of Transformation and the policy goals of the White Paper in higher education. In the ‚ÄúBriefing by the Minister on National Plan for Higher Education‚Äù in March 2001, The Minister of Education, Professor Kader Asmal goes into depth about the importance of such a plan and its expected outcomes before the educational portfolio committee. Asmal begins by stressing the need to proceed with Transformation meticulously and consciously or risk the destruction of tertiary education in South Africa. He also mentions how higher education should not depend upon the market. He states that tertiary education ‚Äúare the engines of the growth of skilled citizens and intellectuals, particularly black intellectuals‚Äù and that the plan ‚Äúis designed to meet the needs of the country‚Äù especially in the categories of ‚Äúscientists and teachers, not just people skilled in information technology‚Äù. Asmal notes that the system is not meeting the needs of South African society. He notes that the plan intends to address the following three key challenges in higher education: inequality and inefficiency; addressing the skills and human resource needs of the country; administrative, management and financial issues. = University-level Transformation measures = The current Transformation program of the University of Cape Town (UCT) focuses on the goals of non-racialization‚Äîthe decentralizing and dismantling of historical Apartheid categories in an effort to diminish their effect on admissions, academic success and likelihood for promotion‚Äîdiversity, inclusivity and engagement with African voices. Specifically, the program states the need for better representation in the faculty and student body as well as improving the cultivation of intellectual diversity, especially in the giving a platform to African voices‚Äîwhom have been marginalized in academia. The program states that students must have critical knowledge and understanding of the country‚Äôs history and the experiences of its citizens. Also, students need to be able to connect this knowledge to their own studies and future work and must have a critical understanding of how current mainstream academic epistemology has roots in embedded power relations that have centralized and prioritized European knowledge and ways of thinking. UCT has recently established specific policies under their 2015 Transformation Program. The policies refer to important aspects in the calls for ‚Äúdecolonization‚Äù of South African universities, specifically representation. The goal of these particular policies is to respond to the calls to decolonize and transform the university from a white dominated environment. There are two parts: the Student Equity Policy (2004); and the Employment Equity Plan (2015-2020). The Student Equity policy directly refers to the concerns of the disproportionate student body. These policies came out of the passing of three particular reports and acts: The White Paper on Higher Education; the Higher Education Act; the National Plan on Higher Education. The equity policy aims to promote equality of access through positive discrimination in admissions, or affirmative action, aiming to admit and matriculate students from underrepresented backgrounds, as well as a promotion of equality in outcomes by providing support to students once they are on campus. Similarly, the University is also attempting to diversify the faculty, especially in regards to the number of tenured faculty of color and women of color. White male professors overwhelmingly make up the majority of tenured and teaching faculty at the university, while the numbers of black, colored and Indian male and female professors are minimal, if non-existent. The university claims particular barriers in recruiting potential employees from these backgrounds. Particularly the difficulty in attracting these candidates to the university with the prevalent atmosphere of exclusivity, a perception that university does not do enough to support faculty members of these backgrounds, and the high number of tenured faculty who are static and the lack of open posts. The university lists particular actions to help ameliorate these barriers and the current representation problem. The plan is an affirmative action plan that prioritizes career development programs that allow candidates to grow into their positions, create a pipeline to target and recruit recent graduates, fill vacancies more consciously, creating an affirmative and inclusive environment. These policies, while a step in the right direction to incorporate disenfranchised communities into the fabric of the university, they don‚Äôt necessarily address the ability of students of color, and especially black students, to empower themselves through their education and disrupt European and Western dominant holds on the means and methods of learning.  Philosophy   Frantz Fanon  In Frantz Fanon‚Äôs The Wretched of the Earth, he explored the idea of decolonization by focusing on the conditions of colonization and the process of decolonization. He describes decolonization as the implementation of the statement, ‚ÄúThe last shall be first.‚Äù This means that the systems and institutions in place that privilege a particular group need to be replaced with ones that redistribute privilege to those who have previously denied. In this vein of reordering society, Fanon engages with the impact that the ‚Äúblack elite‚Äù can have on that process; he specifically notes how the black elite‚Äî who are mostly western educated and trained‚Äî continue the colonial practices and their educational background can become a crutch that impedes change and progress in the post-colonial nation. As Fanon states, decolonization is a process of ‚Äúdisorder‚Äù.  Steve Biko  In the collection of his writings in I write what I like, Steve Biko discusses the ideas of liberation, decolonization, pride and black consciousness. He notes that how during Apartheid, Africans and all things African have been given an inferior status. He explains how this devaluation and oppression of black people have contributed to an environment in which black people live in ‚Äúdenigration and derision‚Äù. This manifests in black people living in a demoralized state as they have internalized their oppression. He advocates on behalf of black consciousness as a means of promoting black pride, equality and value. He identifies two stages in the Black Conscious Movement, ‚ÄúPsychological Liberation‚Äù and ‚ÄúPhysical Liberation‚Äù. Psychological liberation refers to the empowerment black people would experience out of a positive change in mindset regarding their blackness. Biko wrote that ‚Äúwe cannot be conscious of ourselves and yet remain in bondage. We want to attain the envisioned self which is a free self.‚Äù  Achille Mbembe  In his article ‚ÄúDecolonizing the University: New Directions‚Äù, Achille Mbembe discusses the limits placed on the decolonization efforts by the forces of neoliberalism and its connection to decolonization. He states that the role of the university is to ‚Äúencourage students to develop their own intellectual and moral lives‚Äù as well as ‚Äúredistribute equally the capacity to make disciplined inquiries into things we need to know‚Äù. By creating a representative and affirming environment also gives way to the fostering of creativity and ingenuity on college campuses. This force of creativity can be sparked through dismantling market tied learning to allow for, what Mbembe refers to as, this ‚Äúfree pursuit of knowledge‚Äù. By dissociating knowledge with capitalistic pressures, there can be a greater focus of energy on developing new epistemology and ontology in a South African context. It also can allow for the understanding the value of knowledge in other ways. However, he notes that higher education has been severely marketized and commercialized. Here, he claims there is a need to decolonize the spaces of management and access so that students can actually pursue knowledge freely. Furthermore, Mbembe argues that this approach can counter student interest in material versus epistemological payoff. Mbembe discusses the term decolonization, and questions whether we need to dismantle historical systems and institutions or instead focus on systems that have mutated and changed over time.  Student Movements  Student movements and participation across South African Universities have been crucial to the conversation of decolonization of higher education and academic spaces. In the past decade, movements like Rhodes Must Fall, Fees Must Fall and Decolonize UCT Law showcase student dissent and an attempt to decenter the whiteness at the university level and increase marginalized access to education. These organizations do not request seats at the metaphoric, institutional table, but instead push for people to question, reevaluate and reimagine the legitimacy and function of the university in a post-apartheid and post-colonial setting.

It is still used for housing railway workers and part of the building is used as a restaurant. The first passenger subway, which was an underpass to the second platform, was built in 1888. A and subway with concrete floors was built in 1979. By the end of the nineteenth century, it was becoming increasingly apparent that the station had reached the limit of its capacity. Since the location did not allow for a third track, the construction of a freight yard in the district of Wahl with a connection to Crimmitschau station was considered. The cost for the freight yard, including track with a length of 2.35 km, was estimated at 750,000 marks. On 4 April 1898, the proposal was discussed in the Second Chamber of the S√§chsischer Landtag (Saxon parliament) and it was approved. Construction work on the new freight yard began in September of that year. However, the planned construction of the freight station was downgraded to that of a loading point. Instead, the Crimmitschau‚ÄìSchweinsburg railway was built. The new industrial railway was opened on 1 July 1908. As early as 1913, the entrance hall was extended by a porch, thus giving it its current appearance. The interior of the building was redesigned twice, in 1927 and 1966/67. The Leipzig‚ÄìZwickau railway was electrified in 1963. The whole track layout was rebuilt again from June 2002 to October 2003. The station was of great importance in the GDR. Up to 130 people were employed on the tracks in Crimmitschau. In addition to the town centre, the station district was one of the most popular locations. The ticket counter and the whole building were closed at the end of 2001. In the meantime, it has heritage protection. By 2011, two lifts had been installed. With the commissioning of the City-Tunnel in Leipzig in December 2013, the station was integrated into the new network of S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland. It is served by the line S5 service (Zwickau‚ÄìLeipzig‚ÄìHalle) and the line S5X express service (Zwickau‚ÄìLeipzig/Halle Airport).

In this case a massive star (>30 solar masses) collapses to form a rotating black hole emitting twin energetic jets and surrounded by an accretion disk. It is a type of stellar explosion which ejects material with an unusually high kinetic energy, an order of magnitude higher than most supernovae. They usually appear similar to a type Ic supernova, but with unusually broad spectral lines indicating an extremely high expansion velocity. Hypernovae are one of the mechanisms for producing long gamma ray bursts (GRBs), which range from 2 seconds to over a minute in duration. History In the 1980s, the term hypernova was used to describe a theoretical type of supernova now known as a pair-instability supernova. It referred to the extremely high energy of the explosion compared to typical core collapse supernovae. The term had previously been used to describe hypothetical explosions from diverse events such as hyperstars, extremely massive population III stars in the early universe, or from events such as black hole mergers. GRBs were initially detected on July 2, 1967 by US military satellites in high orbit, which were meant to detect gamma radiation. The US had suspected the USSR of conducting secret nuclear tests despite signing the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, and the Vela satellites were capable of detecting explosions behind the moon. The satellites detected a signal, but it was unlike that of a nuclear weapon signature, nor could it be correlated to solar flares. Over the next few decades, the GRBs posed a compelling mystery. Gamma rays require highly energetic events to be produced, yet GRBs could not be correlated to supernovae, solar flares, or any other activity in the sky. Their brevity made them difficult to trace. Once their direction could be determined, it was found that they were evenly spread across the sky. Thus they were not originating in the Milky Way or nearby galaxies, but from deep space. In February 1997, Dutch-Italian satellite BeppoSAX was able to trace GRB 970508 to a faint galaxy roughly 6 billion light years away. From analyzing the spectroscopic data for both the GRB 970508 and its host galaxy, Bloom et al. concluded in 1998 that a hypernova was the likely cause. That same year, hypernovae were hypothesized in greater detail by Polish astronomer Bohdan Paczy≈Ñski as supernovae from rapidly- spinning stars. The usage of the term hypernova from the late 20th century has since been refined to refer to those supernovae with unusually large kinetic energy. The first hypernova observed was SN 1998bw, with a luminosity 100 times higher than a standard Type Ib. This supernova was the first to be associated with a gamma-ray burst (GRB) and it produced a shockwave containing an order of magnitude more energy than a normal supernova. Other scientists prefer to call these objects simply broad-lined type Ic supernovae. Since then the term has been applied to a variety of objects, not all of them meeting the standard definition, for example ASASSN-15lh. Properties Hypernovae are now widely accepted to be supernovae with ejecta having a kinetic energy larger than about , an order of magnitude higher than a typical core collapse supernova. The ejected nickel masses are large and the ejection velocity up to 99% of the speed of light. These are typically of type Ic, and some are associated with long-duration gamma-ray bursts. The electromagnetic energy released by these events varies from comparable to other type Ic supernova, to some of the most luminous supernovae known such as SN 1999as. The archetypal hypernova SN 1998bw was associated with GRB 980425. Its spectrum showed no hydrogen and no clear helium features, but strong silicon lines identified it as a type Ic supernova. The main absorption lines were extremely broadened and the light curve showed a very rapid brightening phase, reaching the brightness of a type Ia supernova at day 16. The total ejected mass was about and the mass of nickel ejected about . All supernovae associated with GRBs have shown the high-energy ejecta that characterises them as hypernovae. Unusually bright radio supernovae have been observed as counterparts to hypernovae, and have been termed radio hypernovae. Astrophysical models  Models for hypernova focus on the efficient transfer of energy into the ejecta. In normal core collapse supernovae, 99% of neutrinos generated in the collapsing core escape without driving the ejection of material. It is thought that rotation of the supernova progenitor drives a jet that accelerates material away from the explosion at close to the speed of light. Binary systems are increasingly being studied as the best method for both stripping stellar envelopes to leave a bare carbon-oxygen core, and for inducing the necessary spin conditions to drive a hypernova. Collapsar model The collapsar model describes a type of supernova that produces a gravitationally collapsed object, or black hole. The word \\"collapsar\\", short for \\"collapsed star\\", was formerly used to refer to the end product of stellar gravitational collapse, a stellar-mass black hole. The word is now sometimes used to refer to a specific model for the collapse of a fast-rotating star. When core collapse occurs in a star with a core at least around fifteen times the sun's mass ()‚Äîthough chemical composition and rotational rate are also significant‚Äîthe explosion energy is insufficient to expel the outer layers of the star, and it will collapse into a black hole without producing a visible supernova outburst. A star with a core mass slightly below this level‚Äîin the range of ‚Äîwill undergo a supernova explosion, but so much of the ejected mass falls back onto the core remnant that it still collapses into a black hole. If such a star is rotating slowly, then it will produce a faint supernova, but if the star is rotating quickly enough, then the fallback to the black hole will produce relativistic jets. The energy that these jets transfer into the ejected shell renders the visible outburst substantially more luminous than a standard supernova. The jets also beam high energy particles and gamma rays directly outward and thereby produce x-ray or gamma-ray bursts; the jets can last for several seconds or longer and correspond to long-duration gamma-ray bursts, but they do not appear to explain short-duration gamma-ray bursts. Binary models The mechanism for producing the stripped progenitor, a carbon-oxygen star lacking any significant hydrogen or helium, of type Ic supernovae was once thought to be an extremely evolved massive star, for example a type WO Wolf-Rayet star whose dense stellar wind expelled all its outer layers. Observations have failed to detect any such progenitors. It is still not conclusively shown that the progenitors are actually a different type of object, but several cases suggest that lower-mass \\"helium giants\\" are the progenitors. These stars are not sufficiently massive to expel their envelopes simply by stellar winds, and they would be stripped by mass transfer to a binary companion. Helium giants are increasingly favoured as the progenitors of type Ib supernovae, but the progenitors of type Ic supernovae is still uncertain. One proposed mechanism for producing gamma-ray bursts is induced gravitational collapse, where a neutron star is triggered to collapse into a black hole by the core collapse of a close companion consisting of a stripped carbon-oxygen core. The induced neutron star collapse allows for the formation of jets and high-energy ejecta that have been difficult to model from a single star.

Meyer focuses mainly on the Political Geography of the Arab World, and the economic as well as urban development in the Middle East, especially in Egypt, Syria, Yemen and the UAE, but also in Germany. He became known to a wider German-speaking audience through more than 1100 interviews on the Iraq War, the Syrian Civil War and on the Libyan Civil War 2011 and 2014. Scientific career Meyer studied Geography and English Literature from 1968 to 1973 at the University of Erlangen‚ÄìNuremberg and the New University of Ulster in Northern Ireland. Back in Erlangen, he took his state exams for higher secondary education in 1973, completed his doctorate in Geography in 1976 and qualified as a university lecturer in 1983 with his post-doctoral thesis and other writings in social geographic studies on developments in rural and nomadic areas.L√§ndliche Lebens- und Wirtschaftsformen Syriens im Wandel.

Since the mid-1990s he started an intense networking activity organizing the cooperation of Institutes of Oriental studies and orientalists on a national, European and global level. He headed the first World Congress on Studies of the Middle East in 2002 (WOCMES) in Mainz. The congress attracted about 2.100 scientists from 68 countries, and 126 journalists from all parts of the world. In 2010 the executive board of WOCMES appointed Meyer again for president. In 2018 he was reelected unanimously for a fifth term of office, until 2022.://www.allgemeine- zeitung.de/lokales/mainz/nachrichten-mainz/mainzer-geograph-guenter-meyer- bleibt-vorstandsvorsitzender-des-orient-weltkongresses_14312830.htm In 2014 he was awarded the Jere L. Bacharach Service Award by the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA). Meyer was the first European honoured with this award. The award certificate mentioned Meyer's tireless efforts to improve communication and interaction between previously separated, different areas of European scholarship: \\"This award honors his vision and skill in establishing new institutional networks to the benefit of scholars around the world.\\" As the chairman of the World Congress of Middle Eastern Studies, Meyer was also in charge of the world congresses in Amman/Jordan, in Barcelona, and in Ankara in August 2014, and is in charge of the congress in Sevilla in 2018. Positions  War in Syria As early as 2012 Meyer attracted attention putting forward his view on the external roots of the conflicts within Syria. He saw a massive and abusive outside interference into inner-Syrian affairs. Western powers seemed to be mainly concerned with extinguishing the \\"Iran- Hezbolla axis\\". According to Meyer, thousands of mujaheddin had been flown in, because the CIA was intending to initiate a civil war to weaken Syria. The media were ignoring the fact, Meyer said, that the majority of the population was still preferring Assad as head of government. With regard to the Civil War in Syria Meyer, from the very beginning expressed himself against all endeavors to remove president Bashar al-Assad from office. Before the Russian military intervention, he expressed a rather positive view on the Russian role in the conflict. Meyer has repeatedly blamed US foreign politics towards Iraq as a main reason for the emergence of Daesh: \\"Without acting against International Law, without the wrong decision taken by Bremer, and without consciously accepting that a Salafi territory might emerge in Syria's eastern parts, with the CIA even considering giving support, it would have never been possible for ISIS to develop into a global threat.\\" Warning of the results of a power vacuum should Assad be removed, he referred to a widely known slogan in Syria: \\"Christians to Lebanon, the Alawites to the grave\\" to emphasise the imminent dangers for people protected by the existing state structure. In February 2016 Meyer presented his view on plans to depose Assad as early as 2001. In 2006 news had been leaked, that the regime should be \\"destabilized\\" by instigating ethnic antagonism. The strategy of supplying weapons the so- called temperate rebel opposition via Libya and Turkey had faltered, because, according to Meyer, those rebels had allied themselves with extremist forces. Turkey was supporting IS willing to do everything possible to prevent the emergence of a Kurdish state. Deposing Assad would cause chaos in Syria, to the sole advantage of extremists. Meyer saw the politics of Russia towards Syria as constructive, he ruled out the possibility of Russia's intentionally intensifying immigration towards Europe. The target of the Russian government was getting back control of part of the country. In a public debate in June 2016 Meyer expressed doubts about a smooth transition of power in case the Assad regime was dissolved. Two military groups, Al-Nusra and IS, could not have a share in power, also the remaining militias had a salafist or radically islamistic outlook, often hostile against each other, only united temporarily by their common enmity towards Assad.

A drawback of standard SSB modulation is the generation of large envelope overshoots well above the average envelope level for a sinusoidal tone (even when the audio signal is peak-limited). In combination with RF amplifiers with non-linear properties this causes severe distortions of the transmitted audio signal. Therefore, the average RF power level must be reduced in order to accommodate the overshoots. The standard SSB envelope peaks are due to truncation of the spectrum and nonlinear phase distortion from the approximation errors of the practical implementation of the required Hilbert transform. It was recently shown that suitable overshoot compensation (so-called controlled-envelope SSB, or CESSB) achieves about 3.8 dB of peak reduction for speech transmission.

Although the generation of the CESSB signal can be integrated into the SSB modulator, it is feasible to separate the generation of the CESSB signal (e.g. in form of an external speech preprocessor) from a conventional SSB radio. This requires that the SSB radio's modulator be linear-phase and have a sufficient bandwidth to pass the CESSB signal.

It is black-pied, with short horns. It is one of three regional breeds in the area, the others being the Valdostana Castana and the Valdostana Pezzata Rossa. Like them, it derives from inter-breeding of various local breeds and types of cattle. It appears to have been most influenced by the Swiss Fribourgeoise and H√©rens breeds, which came into the Valle d'Aosta over the Great St. Bernard Pass. The Valdostana Pezzata Nera is a dual-purpose breed, raised mainly for milk, but also for meat. Management is normally transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps.  History  Like the other cattle breeds of the Valle d'Aosta, the Valdostana Castana and the Valdostana Pezzata Rossa, the Valdostana Pezzata Nera derives from inter- breeding of various local breeds and types of cattle. The most important influence on the development and morphology of the Pezzata Nera appears to have come from the Fribourgeoise (extinct since the 1970s) and H√©rens breeds, which came into the area from Switzerland over the Great St. Bernard Pass. A breeders' association, the Associazione Nazionale Allevatori Bovini Razza Valdostana, was started in 1937, and a herd-book was established in 1985. The Valdostana Pezzata Nera is distributed only in a fairly restricted area of the Valle d'Aosta, in the Valpelline, in the , in the Vallon d'Ollomont, and in the hills flanking the valley of the Dora Baltea between Nus and Aosta. In 1946 it was thought that there were about head. In 1983 the population was estimated at , and in 2014 it was reported as The Valdostana Pezzata Nera is among the eleven breeds which together form the F√©d√©ration Europ√©enne des Races Bovines de l'Arc Alpin, the others being: the Pinzgauer and Tiroler Grauvieh from Austria; the Abondance, Tarentaise and Vosgienne from France; the Hinterw√§lder and Vordelw√§lder from Germany; the Rendena from Italy; and the H√©rens from Switzerland.  Characteristics  The Valdostana Pezzata Nera is black-pied. The legs and belly are often white; the head is usually black, often with a white star. Unlike the Valdostana Castana, which has both red and black hair in its coat, the Pezzata Nera has only black hair in the black areas. The hooves, muzzle and mucosa are slate-black, and the horns short and black-tipped. The hooves are particularly hard. It is robust, frugal and hardy, and well able to exploit high mountain pasture at and above. Management is transhumant: the cattle are stabled only in winter, and spend the summer months on the mountain pastures of the Alps, moving higher as the season progresses.  Use  The Valdostana Pezzata Nera is raised both for milk and for meat. Milk yield averages per lactation; the milk has 3.43% fat and 3.38% protein. It is less productive that the Valdostana Pezzata Rossa, though hardier. This may be in part because the productive abilities of the breed have been reduced by cross-breeding with the Valdostana Castana to produce animals with good cow-fighting qualities. Informal cow-fighting contests have been documented for more than 150 years. In the Valle d'Aosta, formal management of fights dates from 1958, when the Comit√© Regional des Batailles de Reines was formed. The contests have become an important socio-cultural event. Some twenty contests are held between March and October each year, culminating in a final battle and the crowning of the Reine or \\"queen\\". Success may significantly increase the market value of cows.

She served as nominal regent of Joseon during the minority of Gojong's reign, whom she had selected to place upon the throne, in 1864-1873, although she left all de facto power to the king's father Heungseon Daewongun and only kept the formal title as regent. Life Queen Sinjeong was born on 21 January 1809 into the Pungyang Jo clan to Jo Man-yeong and Lady Deok-an of the Eunjin Song clan during King Sunjo's 8th year of reign. In 1819, she became Crown Princess Consort when she married Crown Prince Hyomyeong, and gave birth to the future King Heonjeong on 8 September 1827. From 1827, her husband had acted as regent for his father when he was ill, but died at the age of 20 in 1830. King Sunjo then died from his illness in 1834. Her son, Heonjong of Joseon, became king in 1834 but died childless in 1849, and was succeeded by a distant relative, Cheoljong of Joseon. After the death of her son, she was given the title Grand Royal Dowager Queen Sinjeong. In January 1864, King Cheoljong died without an heir. There were no male heirs, the result of suspected foul play by a rival branch of the royal family, the Andong Kim clan. The Andong Kim clan had risen to power through intermarriage with the House of Yi. The selection of the next king was in the hands of three dowagers: Queen Sinjeong, mother of King Heonjong; Queen Myeongheon, King Heonjong‚Äôs wife; and Queen Cheorin, Cheoljong's wife. The \\"designation right\\" resided with Dowager Queen Sinjeong, as she was the oldest of the dowagers.Choe Ching Young. The Rule of the Taew≈èn‚Äôgun, 1864-1873: Restoration in Yi Korea. Cambridge, Mass.: East Asian Research Center, Harvard University, 1972. Queen Cheorin, the queen consort of Cheoljong and a member of the Andong Kim clan, claimed the right to choose the next king, although traditionally, the eldest queen dowager is the one with the authority to select the new king. Cheoljong‚Äôs cousin, Grand Royal Dowager Queen Sinjeong (the widow of King Heonjong's father [entitled Ikjong]) of the Pungyang Jo clan, who too had risen to prominence by intermarriage with the Yi family, currently held this title. Queen Sinjeong saw an opportunity to advance the cause of the Pungyang Jo clan, the only true rival of the Andong Kim clan in Korean politics. As Cheoljong fell deeper under his illness, the Grand Royal Dowager Queen was approached by Yi Ha-eung, a descendant of King Injo (r.1623‚Äì1649), whose father was made an adoptive son of Prince Eunsin, a nephew of King Yeongjo (r.1724‚Äì1776). The branch that Yi Ha-eung's family belonged to was an obscure line of descent of the Yi clan, which survived the often deadly political intrigue that frequently embroiled the Joseon court by forming no affiliation with any factions. Yi Ha-eung himself was ineligible for the throne due to a law that dictated that any possible heir to the kingdom be part of the generation after the most recent incumbent of the throne, but his second son Yi Myeong-bok, and later Emperor Gojong, was a possible successor to the throne. The Pungyang Jo clan saw that Yi Myeong-bok was only twelve years old and would not be able to rule in his own name until he came of age, and that they could easily influence Yi Ha-eung, who would be acting as regent for the future king. As soon as news of Cheoljong's death reached Yi Ha-eung through his intricate network of spies in the palace, he and the Pungyang Jo clan took the hereditary royal seal ‚Äî an object that was considered necessary for a legitimate reign to take place and aristocratic recognition to be received ‚Äî effectively giving her absolute power to select the successor to the throne. By the time Cheoljong's death had become a known fact, the Andong Kim clan was powerless according to law as the seal lay in the hands of the Grand Royal Dowager Queen Sinjeong. In an apocryphal story, Queen Cheorin sent a minister to fetch the son of Yi Ha-eung, eleven-year-old Yi Myeong-bok, who was flying a kite in a palace garden. The son was brought to the palace in a sedan chair, where Queen Sinjeong rushed forward and called him her son, thus producing the new Joseon king, King Gojong, adopted son of Crown Prince Hyomyeong.Cumings, Bruce. Korea‚Äôs Place in the Sun: A Modern History. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2005. This story may or may not be true. These facts, however, are known to be correct. On 16 January 1864, Yi Myeong-bok was appointed the Prince of Ikseong by Dowager Queen Sinjeong. The next day, his father was granted the title Heungseon Daewongun. On 21 January, Yi Myeong-bok was enthroned as King Gojong, and Dowager Queen Sinjeong began her regency. Yi was apparently chosen because \\"he was the only suitable surviving male member of the Yi clan and closest by blood to the royal house\\". Since Gojong was so young, Queen Sinjeong invited the Daewongun to assist his son in ruling. She virtually renounced her right to be regent, and though she remained the titular regent, the Daewongun was in fact the true ruler. Queen Sinjeong died on 4 June 1890 during Gojong's 27th year of reign. Nine years after her death, and during the 3rd year reign of Emperor Gwangmu, she was given the posthumous title of \\"Empress Shin Jeong-ik (Hangul: Ïã†Ï†ïÏùµÌô©ÌõÑ, Hanja: Á•ûË≤ûÁøºÁöáÂêé), and Crown Prince Hyomyeong was given the posthumous title of \\"Emperor Moon Jo-ik\\" (Hangul: Î¨∏Ï°∞ÏùµÌô©Ï†ú, Hanja: ÊñáÁ•ñÁøºÁöáÂ∏ù).

He was ordained as a priest just prior to the beginning of World War II in which he became a vocal critic of the Nazi regime and its actions; this earned him their ire and he was arrested before being sent to the Dachau concentration camp where he was administered a lethal injection. His beatification was celebrated in Dresden on 13 June 2011. Life Alojs Andritzki was born in 1914 as the fourth of six children to the schoolteacher Johann Andritzki and Magdalena Ziesch. His father took all the children once a month to visit various shrines and instilled in them piety. This prompted his two older brothers to become priests themselves. His two sisters were Marja and Marta and his three brothers were Jan and Great and Alfons who was the sixth child and a Jesuit who died in World War II as a soldier. In 1934 he began theological studies at Paderborn and later began official studies to become a priest in Bautzen; he was elevated to the diaconate in 1938. Andritzki received his ordination to the priesthood on 30 July 1939 in Bautzen from Bishop Petrus Legge and he celebrated his first Mass in Radibor on the following 6 August. The Gestapo oversaw his arrest on 21 January 1941 for producing Christmas theatre and was described as having made \\"hostile statements\\" against the Nazi regime thus the motivator for his arrest. He was interrogated on 7 February 1941 and was first sent to the detention center at Dresden but was moved two months later on 2 October 1941 to the Dachau concentration camp with the prisoner number 27829. Back in July 1941 he was sentenced to six months due to \\"insidious attacks\\" against the regime. His father sent a moving letter to Berlin asking for pardon since there were no charges but this appeal was instead ignored. He was a talented musician and artist and had painted the Nativity scene in the prison barracks for Christmas for a makeshift chapel. He also entertained fellow inmates when he would walk on his hands. It was while imprisoned that he met the two Schoenstatt priests Joseph Fischer and Heinz Dresbach. He fell ill with typhoid around Christmas of 1942 but did not go to the infirmary until 19 January 1943. Andritzki's final request was to receive the Eucharist but the guards and warden scoffed at this suggestion and decided instead to euthanize him; the warden jeered and said: \\"He wants Christ. We'll give him an injection instead\\". He received the lethal injection and died as a result of this overdose of chemicals. The Nazis claimed that he died of abdominal typhoid in order to hide the fact that the priest had been killed. His remains were dismembered and incinerated. His ashes were sent in an urn to his parents and the urn was interred in a Dresden cemetery on 15 April 1943. His remains were later relocated to Dresden Cathedral on 5 February 2011. The Sorb ethnic group have long revered him. Beatification Beatification in Dresden 2011 The beatification process opened in a diocesan process that spanned from 1 July 1998 until its closure sometime later on 22 March 2001; this process was held in Dresden. The formal introduction came under Pope John Paul II on 27 August 1998 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and titled him as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process after receiving the boxes of documentation and it also received the Positio dossier from the postulation in 2003. Theologians approved this on 7 November 2009 as did the C.C.S. on 9 November 2010. Pope Benedict XVI confirmed on 10 December 2010 that Andritzki was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (\\"in hatred of the faith\\") and therefore approved his beatification. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over it on the pope's behalf on 13 June 2011 in Dresden with around 11 000 people in attendance including the Dresden bishop Joachim Reinelt and the Saxony State Premier Stanislaw Tillich. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.

It follows a journey of a group of prominent citizens as they transit the route. The 2 reel silent film was originally filmed on 35mm acetate film, a technology abandoned because the film stock was unstable, prone to decay, and was highly flammable. The only known existing print is a copy to 16mm conventional film stock. The film is approximately an hour long. Director Frank Holmes was just 17 years old when he made the film. The port, and rail link, were worked on from 1913 to 1917. The project was left incomplete, when World War One required its construction resources. When funds were found to complete the project, its destination was changed from Port Nelson to Churchill, Manitoba, due to technical problems with maintaining a port at Port Nelson. The party left The Pas, Manitoba, in an especially chartered train, traveling across northern Manitoba, to \\"the end of steel\\", at Kettle Rapids, Manitoba, where resources to build the railway ran out. They then proceeded by canoe to near the Port facilities, where they transferred to \\"Government boats\\". Holmes had to go to court to receive his payment for making the film.

Its centrepiece is the world's tallest indoor waterfall, the Rain Vortex, which is surrounded by a terraced forest setting. Jewel includes gardens, attractions, a hotel, about 300 retail and dining outlets, and convenient early baggage check-in aviation facilities. It covers a total gross floor area of 135,700 m2, spanning 10 storeys ‚Äì five above-ground and five basement levels. Its attractions include the Shiseido Forest Valley, an indoor garden spanning five storeys, and the Canopy Park at the topmost level, featuring gardens and leisure facilities. Jewel receives about 300,000 visitations a day. In October 2019, six months after its soft opening, it had welcomed 50 million visitors, exceeding its initial target for whole year. The complex and airport is located in Changi, at the eastern end of Singapore, approximately northeast from Singapore's Downtown Core. Conception Jewel was conceived to maintain Changi Airport's status as a major aviation hub in the Asia-Pacific. It was first mentioned by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day Rally speech in 2013 as part of Changi Airport's long-term plans to double its capacity by the mid-2020s and \\"create more opportunities for Singapore and Singaporeans\\". Built over the former open-air car park in front of Changi Airport Terminal 1, Jewel expanded Terminal 1's arrival hall and baggage claim areas by 70%, and its handling capacity is also expected to increase from 21 to 24 million passengers a year. Jewel was officially opened on 18 October 2019 by Lee Hsien Loong, six months after its soft opening. During this time, it had received 50 million visitors ‚Äì about 300,000 visitors a day ‚Äì exceeding its initial target of 40-50 million visitors for the first year. Jewel was developed by Jewel Changi Airport Trustee Pte Ltd, a joint venture between Changi Airport Group (CAG) and CapitaLand, through its wholly owned shopping mall business, CapitaLand Mall Asia. The project cost S$1.7 billion, and did not involve any government funds or taxpayers‚Äô money. Design and development Jewel's toroidal glass-and- steel fa√ßade was designed by a consortium of architects, led by Moshe Safdie, who also designed Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. Renowned local firm RSP Architects Planners & Engineers were the executive architect and structural engineers. The landscape architect was Peter Walker and Partners, who co- designed the National 9/11 Memorial and worked with Safdie on the landscaping of Marina Bay Sands. Benoy were the interior designers; BuroHappold Engineering were responsible for the fa√ßade and Lighting Planners Associates handled the lighting.Jewel Changi Airport 6 May 2019 The Rain Vortex was engineered by water design firm WET Design. It has a 360-degree light and sound show projected onto it.World's tallest indoor waterfall inside Safdie Architects' Singapore airport building Dezeen, 12 March 2019 Jewel was envisioned to combine a marketplace and an urban park. \\"The component of the traditional mall is combined with the experience of nature, culture, education and recreation, aiming to provide an uplifting experience. By drawing both visitors and local residents alike, we aim to create a place where the people of Singapore interact with the people of the world,\\" said Safdie. The glass panels of the dome are framed in steel which rests on a complex latticework. At night, the glowing beautiful dome would be visible from all surrounding areas. Attractions Shiseido Forest Valley A collaboration of Shiseido and art collective teamLab from Japan, the is one of Asia's largest indoor gardens, spanning five stories and approximately 22,000 square meters located in the heart of Jewel Changi Airport. It houses around 3,000 trees and 60,000 shrubs of 120 species that live in high-altitude tropical forests from around the world. The Rain Vortex The Rain Vortex The Rain Vortex, sponsored as the HSBC Rain Vortex, it is the world's largest and tallest indoor waterfall, standing at high. Recirculating rain water is pumped to the roof to free fall through a round hole at up to per minute to a basement-level pool. An acrylic funnel at the bottom prevents splashing and insulates the sound of the cascade. The toroid-shaped roof has more than 9,000 pieces of glass spanning 200 by 150 meters with a sloped oculus as the mouth of the waterfall acting as \\"a continuation of the building...completed in a liquid form.\\" At night, the circular walls of the waterfall becomes a 360-degree stage for a light-and-sound show. To prevent excess humidity in the Jewel, the waterfall's flow alternates between cascades and trickles that reduce air turbulence. The design process by WET Design engineers included testing an on- fifth-scale model and a full-size partial prototype. The Changi Airport Skytrain connecting the terminals passes above ground near the waterfall, allowing passengers remaining airside to see the Vortex and Jewel itself. Canopy Park At the topmost level of Jewel, the 14,000 sq m Canopy Park houses recreation and leisure attractions. About half of the total landscaping is hosted at Canopy Park, including two gardens: Topiary Walk and Petal Garden. The Topiary Walk features animal-shaped topiaries at every corner, while the Petal Garden will have seasonal floral displays. The park includes a suspension bridge called the Canopy Bridge that is located 23 metres above the ground which offers a panoramic view of the Rain Vortex. At 50 metres long, the Canopy Bridge also has a glass panel flooring at the centre section that offers a view through to level 1 of Jewel. The Canopy Park houses nine food and beverage outlets. Aloha Poke, Arteastiq Bistro, Burger & Lobster, Herit8ge, Prive, Rumours Bar & Grill, Tanuki Raw, The World is Flat, and Tiger Street Lab are all located on the fifth floor between the exit and entry to Canopy Park. Purchasing a ticket is required to enter the Canopy Park, priced at S$4.50 for Singaporeans and S$5 for non-residents, with additional costs for each of the mazes, bridge, nets, and experience studio. *Canopy Mazes The park also consists of two mazes, situated at the eastern end of the Jewel called the Hedge Maze and Mirror Maze. The Hedge Maze is Singapore's largest with hedge walls standing at 1.8m high. The maze features gates that can be pushed within that will change the path of the maze. It ends at an elevated watchtower that offers a bird's-eye view of the entire maze. The Mirror Maze is located under the dome with plants branching across the top of the maze. The maze makes use of mirrors and various reflections. *Sky Nets The Sky Nets, also called the Manulife Sky Nets for sponsorship reasons, provide children's play facilities, including a Bouncing Net and a Walking Net. The Bouncing Net is 250 metres long, suspended 8 metres above ground at its highest point. A separate 50-metre long Walking Net enables visitors to look down 25 metres to Jewel's Level 1. *Discovery Slides The Discovery Slides feature four integrated slides: two tube slides and two sliding surfaces. The entire structure sits at an incline, 3m high on one end, and close to 7m on the other, and enables visitors to view the Forest Valley and the Rain Vortex.

Between 1924 and 1927 she was a member of the Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\"). Life Lina Maria Becker was born into a working class socialist family in Hanover. After 1918, like her brothers (1894-1942) and Ernst Becker (1900-1932) she joined the newly emerging Communist Party and became politically active in the Hamburg region. Between 1924 and 1927 she sat as a Communist member of the Hamburg Parliament (\\"Hamburgische B√ºrgerschaft\\"). At some stage she married Emil Unfried (1892‚Äì1949), another Communist Party member during the years following the First World War, and later a successful film maker. Like her brothers and her husband, Lina Maria Becker belonged to the relatively moderate right wing of the Communist Party during a decade when the party was increasingly controlled by hard left pro-Stalin leadership. Emil Unfried lost his party membership in 1924, and by the end of the decade his wife had also ceased to be politically active, although there is mention of her having been critical of the German Communist Party leadership in the early 1930s. Lina Maria Becker-Unfried was widowed in 1949 when her husband died in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Despite having rejoined the Communist Party in 1945 he had been denounced to and arrested by the occupying forces who were by that time running the camp (renamed NKVD special camp Nr. 7). His widow lived on till 1976, continuing to shun political involvement. By the time she died she was living in Bremen in West Germany, able to live comfortably because of profits remaining from her husband's cinema ownership.

It was employed by Russia, in the Baltic Campaign of the Crimean War. Mine The German-born Russian engineer Moritz von Jacobi designed the Jacobi naval mine in 1853. An anchor tied the mine to the seabed; a cable connected it to a galvanic cell which powered it from the shore, the power of its explosive charge equated to of black powder. In the summer of 1853 the Committee for Mines of the Ministry of War of the Russian Empire approved the production of the Jacobi mine. What became the Crimean War formally started between the Russian Empire and the Ottoman Empire in October 1853. France and Great Britain declared war on Russia in March 1854. In 1854 the Russians laid 60 Jacobi mines in the vicinity of the Forts Pavel and Alexander (Kronstadt), in order to deter the British Baltic Fleet and its allied French fleet from attacking them. (The Royal Navy arrived in the Baltic in April 1854; the French force in June 1854.) The Jacobi mines gradually phased out their direct competitors,the Nobel mines, on the insistence of admiral Fyodor Litke. The Russians bought their Nobel mines from the Russia- based Swedish industrialist Immanuel Nobel, who had entered into collusion with Russian Minister of the Navy, Prince Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov. Despite their high cost (100 Russian rubles), the Nobel mines proved fault- prone, exploding during the laying process, failing to explode, or detaching from their wires and drifting uncontrollably; the British subsequently disarmed at least 70 of them. In 1855 Russia laid 301 more Jacobi mines around Kronstadt and Lisy Nos; British ships did not dare to approach them.

It often has the aim of damaging the reputation of a person or entity, or making money through advertising revenue.Schlesinger, Robert (April 14, 2017). \\"Fake News in Reality\\". U.S. News & World Report.\\"The Real Story of 'Fake News': The term seems to have emerged around the end of the 19th century\\". Merriam- Webster. Retrieved October 13, 2017. Once common in print, the prevalence of fake news has increased with the rise of social media, especially the Facebook News Feed. Political polarization, post-truth politics, confirmation bias, and social media algorithms have been implicated in the spread of fake news. It is sometimes generated and propagated by hostile foreign actors, particularly during elections. The use of anonymously-hosted fake news websites has made it difficult to prosecute sources of fake news for libel. In some definitions, fake news includes satirical articles misinterpreted as genuine, and articles that employ sensationalist or clickbait headlines that are not supported in the text. Fake news can reduce the impact of real news by competing with it; a Buzzfeed analysis found that the top fake news stories about the 2016 U.S. presidential election received more engagement on Facebook than top stories from major media outlets.Chang, Juju; Lefferman, Jake; Pedersen, Claire; Martz, Geoff (November 29, 2016). \\"When Fake News Stories Make Real News Headlines\\". Nightline. ABC News. It also has the potential to undermine trust in serious media coverage. The term has at times been used to cast doubt upon legitimate news, and U.S. President Donald Trump has been credited with popularizing the term by using it to describe any negative press coverage of himself. It has been increasingly criticized, due in part to Trump's misuse, with the British government deciding to avoid the term, as it is \\"poorly- defined\\" and \\"conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference\\".  Definition  Fake news is a neologism. Fake news, or fake news websites, have no basis in fact, but are presented as being factually accurate. Media scholar Dr. Nolan Higdon has argued that the definition of fake news has been applied too narrowly to select mediums and political ideologies. Michael Radutzky, a producer of CBS 60 Minutes, said his show considers fake news to be \\"stories that are probably false, have enormous traction [popular appeal] in the culture, and are consumed by millions of people.\\" These stories are not only found in politics, but also in areas like vaccination, stock values and nutrition. He did not include news that is \\"invoked by politicians against the media for stories that they don't like or for comments that they don't like\\" as fake news. Guy Campanile, also a 60 Minutes producer said, \\"What we are talking about are stories that are fabricated out of thin air. By most measures, deliberately, and by any definition, that's a lie.\\" The intent and purpose of fake news is important. In some cases, what appears to be fake news may be news satire, which uses exaggeration and introduces non-factual elements that are intended to amuse or make a point, rather than to deceive. Propaganda can also be fake news. Some researchers have highlighted that \\"fake news\\" may be distinguished not just by the falsity of its content, but also the \\"character of [its] online circulation and reception\\". Claire Wardle of First Draft News identifies seven types of fake news: # satire or parody (\\"no intention to cause harm but has potential to fool\\") # false connection (\\"when headlines, visuals or captions don't support the content\\") # misleading content (\\"misleading use of information to frame an issue or an individual\\") # false context (\\"when genuine content is shared with false contextual information\\") # impostor content (\\"when genuine sources are impersonated\\" with false, made-up sources) # manipulated content (\\"when genuine information or imagery is manipulated to deceive\\", as with a \\"doctored\\" photo) # fabricated content (\\"new content is 100% false, designed to deceive and do harm\\") In the context of the United States of America and its election processes in the 2010s, fake news generated considerable controversy and argument, with some commentators defining concern over it as moral panic or mass hysteria and others worried about damage done to public trust. In January 2017, the United Kingdom House of Commons commenced a parliamentary inquiry into the \\"growing phenomenon of fake news\\". Some, most notably United States President Donald Trump, have broadened the meaning of \\"fake news\\" to include news that was negative of his presidency. In November 2017, Claire Wardle (mentioned above) announced she has rejected the phrase \\"fake news\\" and \\"censors it in conversation\\", finding it \\"woefully inadequate\\" to describe the issues. She now speaks of \\"information pollution\\" and distinguishes between three types of problems: 'mis-information', 'dis- information', and 'mal-information': # Mis-information: false information disseminated without harmful intent. # Dis-information: created and shared by people with harmful intent. # Mal-information: the sharing of \\"genuine\\" information with the intent to cause harm. Author Terry Pratchett, who had a background as a journalist and press officer, was among the first to be concerned about the spread of fake news on the Internet. In a 1995 interview with Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, he said \\"Let's say I call myself the Institute for Something-or-other and I decide to promote a spurious treatise saying the Jews were entirely responsible for the second world war and the Holocaust didn't happen and it goes out there on the Internet and is available on the same terms as any piece of historical research which has undergone peer review and so on. There's a kind of parity of esteem of information on the net. It's all there: there's no way of finding out whether this stuff has any bottom to it or whether someone has just made it up\\". Gates was optimistic and disagreed, saying that authorities on the Net would index and check facts and reputations in a much more sophisticated way than in print. But it was Pratchett who had \\"accurately predicted how the internet would propagate and legitimize fake news\\".  Types  Here are a few examples of fake news and how they are viewed: * Clickbait * Propaganda * Satire/parody * Sloppy journalism * Misleading headings * Biased or slanted news * Manipulation These are features of fake news and may help to identify and avoid instances of fake news.  Identifying  Infographic How to spot fake news published by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) published a summary in diagram form (pictured at right) to assist people in recognizing fake news. Its main points are: # Consider the source (to understand its mission and purpose) # Read beyond the headline (to understand the whole story) # Check the authors (to see if they are real and credible) # Assess the supporting sources (to ensure they support the claims) # Check the date of publication (to see if the story is relevant and up to date) # Ask if it is a joke (to determine if it is meant to be satire) # Review your own biases (to see if they are affecting your judgment) # Ask experts (to get confirmation from independent people with knowledge). The International Fact- Checking Network (IFCN), launched in 2015, supports international collaborative efforts in fact-checking, provides training, and has published a code of principles. In 2017 it introduced an application and vetting process for journalistic organisations. One of IFCN's verified signatories, the independent, not-for-profit media journal The Conversation, created a short animation explaining its fact checking process, which involves \\"extra checks and balances, including blind peer review by a second academic expert, additional scrutiny and editorial oversight\\". Beginning in the 2017 school year, children in Taiwan study a new curriculum designed to teach critical reading of propaganda and the evaluation of sources. Called \\"media literacy\\", the course provides training in journalism in the new information society.  Detecting fake news online  Fake news has become increasingly prevalent over the last few years, with over 100 incorrect articles and rumors spread incessantly just with regard to the 2016 United States presidential election. These fake news articles tend to come from satirical news websites or individual websites with an incentive to propagate false information, either as clickbait or to serve a purpose. Since they typically hope to intentionally promote incorrect information, such articles are quite difficult to detect. When identifying a source of information, one must look at many attributes, including but not limited to the content of the email and social media engagements. specifically, the language is typically more inflammatory in fake news than real articles, in part because the purpose is to confuse and generate clicks. Furthermore, modeling techniques such as n-gram encodings and bag of words have served as other linguistic techniques to determine the legitimacy of a news source. On top of that, researchers have determined that visual-based cues also play a factor in categorizing an article, specifically some features can be designed to assess if a picture was legitimate and provides more clarity on the news. There is also many social context features that can play a role, as well as the model of spreading the news. Websites such as \\"Snopes\\" try to detect this information manually, while certain universities are trying to build mathematical models to do this themselves.  History   Ancient  Roman politician and general Mark Antony killed himself because of misinformation. In the 13th century BC, Rameses the Great spread lies and propaganda portraying the Battle of Kadesh as a stunning victory for the Egyptians; he depicted scenes of himself smiting his foes during the battle on the walls of nearly all his temples. The treaty between the Egyptians and the Hittites, however, reveals that the battle was actually a stalemate. During the first century BC, Octavian ran a campaign of misinformation against his rival Mark Antony, portraying him as a drunkard, a womanizer, and a mere puppet of the Egyptian queen Cleopatra VII. He published a document purporting to be Mark Antony's will, which claimed that Mark Antony, upon his death, wished to be entombed in the mausoleum of the Ptolemaic pharaohs. Although the document may have been forged, it invoked outrage from the Roman populace. Mark Antony ultimately killed himself after his defeat in the Battle of Actium upon hearing false rumors propagated by Cleopatra herself claiming that she had committed suicide. During the second and third centuries AD, false rumors were spread about Christians claiming that they engaged in ritual cannibalism and incest. In the late third century AD, the Christian apologist Lactantius invented and exaggerated stories about pagans engaging in acts of immorality and cruelty, while the anti-Christian writer Porphyry invented similar stories about Christians.  Medieval  In 1475, a fake news story in Trent claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two-and-a-half-year-old Christian infant named Simonino. The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured; 15 of them were burned at the stake. Pope Sixtus IV himself attempted to stamp out the story; however, by that point, it had already spread beyond anyone's control. Stories of this kind were known as \\"blood libel\\"; they claimed that Jews purposely killed Christians, especially Christian children, and used their blood for religious or ritual purposes.  Early modern period  After the invention of the printing press in 1439, publications became widespread but there was no standard of journalistic ethics to follow. By the 17th century, historians began the practice of citing their sources in footnotes. In 1610 when Galileo went on trial, the demand for verifiable news increased. During the 18th century publishers of fake news were fined and banned in the Netherlands; one man, Gerard Lodewijk van der Macht, was banned four times by Dutch authorities‚Äîand four times he moved and restarted his press. In the American colonies, Benjamin Franklin wrote fake news about murderous \\"scalping\\" Indians working with King George III in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of the American Revolution. Canards, the successors of the 16th century pasquinade, were sold in Paris on the street for two centuries, starting in the 17th century. In 1793, Marie Antoinette was executed in part because of popular hatred engendered by a canard on which her face had been printed. During the era of slave-owning in the United States, supporters of slavery propagated fake news stories about African Americans, whom white people considered to have lower status. Violence occurred in reaction to the spread of some fake news events. In one instance, stories of African Americans spontaneously turning white spread through the south and struck fear into the hearts of many people. Rumors and anxieties about slave rebellions were common in Virginia from the beginning of the colonial period, despite the only major uprising occurring in the 19th century. One particular instance of fake news regarding revolts occurred in 1730. The serving governor of Virginia at the time, Governor William Gooch, reported that a slave rebellion had occurred but was effectively put down‚Äîalthough this never happened. After Gooch discovered the falsehood, he ordered slaves found off plantations to be punished, tortured, and made prisoners.  19th century  A \\"lunar animal\\" said to have been discovered by John Herschel on the Moon One instance of fake news was the Great Moon Hoax of 1835. The New York Sun published articles about a real-life astronomer and a made-up colleague who, according to the hoax, had observed bizarre life on the moon. The fictionalized articles successfully attracted new subscribers, and the penny paper suffered very little backlash after it admitted the next month that the series had been a hoax. Such stories were intended to entertain readers and not to mislead them. From 1800 to 1810, James Cheetham made use of fictional stories to advocate politically against Aaron Burr. His stories were often defamatory and he was frequently sued for libel. Yellow journalism peaked in the mid-1890s characterizing the sensationalist journalism that arose in the circulation war between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal. Pulitzer and other yellow journalism publishers goaded the United States into the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, which was precipitated when the exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba. Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst caricatured as they urged the U.S. into the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.  20th century  Fake news became popular and spread quickly in the 1900s. Media like newspapers, articles, and magazines were in high demand because of technology. Author Sarah Churchwell asserts that it was Woodrow Wilson who popularized the phrase 'fake news' in 1915, although the phrase had been used in the US in the previous century.Sarah Churchwell Behold America: A History of America First and the American Dream. Bloomsbury, 2018. p. 44. During the First World War, an example of fake news was the anti-German atrocity propaganda regarding an alleged \\"German Corpse Factory\\" in which the German battlefield dead were supposedly rendered down for fats used to make nitroglycerine, candles, lubricants, human soap and boot dubbing. Unfounded rumors regarding such a factory circulated in the Allied press starting in 1915, and by 1917 the English-language publication North China Daily News presented these allegations as true at a time when Britain was trying to convince China to join the Allied war effort; this was based on new, allegedly true stories from The Times and The Daily Mail that turned out to be forgeries. These false allegations became known as such after the war, and in the Second World War Joseph Goebbels used the story in order to deny the ongoing massacre of Jews as British propaganda. According to Joachim Neander and Randal Marlin, the story also \\"encouraged later disbelief\\" when reports about the Holocaust surfaced after the liberation of Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps. After Hitler and the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany in 1933, they established the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda under the control of Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. The Nazis used both print and broadcast journalism to promote their agendas, either by obtaining ownership of those media or exerting political influence. Throughout World War II, both the Axis and the Allies employed fake news in the form of propaganda to persuade the public at home and in enemy countries. The British Political Warfare Executive used radio broadcasts and distributed leaflets to discourage German troops. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has published that The New York Times printed fake news \\"depicting Russia as a socialist paradise.\\" During 1932‚Äì1933, The New York Times published numerous articles by its Moscow bureau chief, Walter Duranty, who won a Pulitzer prize for a series of reports about the Soviet Union.  21st century  In the 21st century, both the impact of fake news and the use of the term became widespread. The increasing openness, access and prevalence of the Internet resulted in it growing to unimaginable breadth. New information and stories may be published around the clock and by anyone which has resulted in the creation of unwanted, untruthful and misleading information, often lacking in verification, which may be consumed by anyone with an Internet connection. Fake news has grown from being sent via emails to attacking social media. Besides referring to made-up stories designed to deceive readers into clicking on links, maximizing traffic and profit, the term has also referred to satirical news, whose purpose is not to mislead but rather to inform viewers and share humorous commentary about real news and the mainstream media. United States examples of satire (as opposed to fake news) include the television show Saturday Night Lives Weekend Update, The Daily Show, The Colbert Report, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Onion newspaper. 21st century fake news is often intended to increase the financial profits of the news outlet. In an interview with NPR, Jestin Coler, former CEO of the fake media conglomerate Disinfomedia, told who writes fake news articles, who funds these articles, and why fake news creators create and distribute false information. Coler, who has since left his role as a fake news creator, said that his company employed 20 to 25 writers at a time and made $10,000 to $30,000 monthly from advertisements. Coler began his career in journalism as a magazine salesman before working as a freelance writer. He said he entered the fake news industry to prove to himself and others just how rapidly fake news can spread. Disinfomedia is not the only outlet responsible for the distribution of fake news; Facebook users play a major role in feeding into fake news stories by making sensationalized stories \\"trend\\", according to BuzzFeed media editor Craig Silverman, and the individuals behind Google AdSense basically fund fake news websites and their content. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook, said, \\"I think the idea that fake news on Facebook influenced the election in any way, I think is a pretty crazy idea\\" and then a few days later he blogged that Facebook was looking for ways to flag fake news stories. Many online pro-Trump fake news stories are being sourced out of a city of Veles in Macedonia, where approximately seven different fake news organizations are employing hundreds of teenagers to rapidly produce and plagiarize sensationalist stories for different U.S. based companies and parties. One fake news writer, Paul Horner, was behind the widespread hoax that he was the graffiti artist Banksy and had been arrested; that a man stopped a robbery in a diner by quoting Pulp Fiction; and that he had an \\"enormous impact\\" on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, according to CBS News. These stories consistently appeared in Google's top news search results, were shared widely on Facebook, were taken seriously and shared by third parties such as Trump presidential campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Eric Trump, ABC News and the Fox News Channel. Horner later claimed that his work during this period was intended \\"to make Trump's supporters look like idiots for sharing my stories\\". In a November 2016 interview with The Washington Post, Horner expressed regret for the role his fake news stories played in the election and surprise at how gullible people were in treating his stories as news. In February 2017 Horner said, \\"I truly regret my comment about saying that I think Donald Trump is in the White House because of me. I know all I did was attack him and his supporters and got people not to vote for him. When I said that comment it was because I was confused how this evil got elected President and I thought maybe instead of hurting his campaign, maybe I had helped it. My intention was to get his supporters NOT to vote for him and I know for a fact that I accomplished that goal. The far right, a lot of the Bible thumpers and alt-right were going to vote him regardless, but I know I swayed so many that were on the fence.\\"Welch, Dennis (February 16, 2017). \\"Fake news writer 'regrets' taking credit for Trump victory\\".

Kim LaCapria of the fact checking website Snopes.com has stated that, in America, fake news is a bipartisan phenomenon, saying that \\"[t]here has always been a sincerely held yet erroneous belief misinformation is more red than blue in America, and that has never been true.\\" Jeff Green of Trade Desk agrees the phenomenon affects both sides. Green's company found that affluent and well-educated persons in their 40s and 50s are the primary consumers of fake news. He told Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes that this audience tends to live in an \\"echo chamber\\" and that these are the people who vote. In 2014, the Russian Government used disinformation via networks such as RT to create a counter-narrative after Russian-backed Ukrainian rebels shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. In 2016, NATO claimed it had seen a significant rise in Russian propaganda and fake news stories since the invasion of Crimea in 2014. Fake news stories originating from Russian government officials were also circulated internationally by Reuters news agency and published in the most popular news websites in the United States. A 2018 study at Oxford University found that Trump's supporters consumed the \\"largest volume of 'junk news' on Facebook and Twitter\\": In 2018, researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College and the University of Exeter examined the consumption of fake news during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Their findings showed that Trump supporters and older Americans (over 60) were far more likely to consume fake news than Clinton supporters. Those most likely to visit fake news websites were the 10% of Americans who consumed the most conservative information. There was a very large difference (800%) in the consumption of fake news stories as related to total news consumption between Trump supporters (6%) and Clinton supporters (1%). The study also showed that fake pro-Trump and fake pro-Clinton news stories were read by their supporters, but with a significant difference: Trump supporters consumed far more (40%) than Clinton supporters (15%). Facebook was by far the key \\"gateway\\" website where these fake stories were spread and which led people to then go to the fake news websites. Fact checks of fake news were rarely seen by consumers, with none of those who saw a fake news story being reached by a related fact check. Brendan Nyhan, one of the researchers, emphatically stated in an interview on NBC News: \\"People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites‚Äîfull stop.\\" A 2019 study by researchers at Princeton and New York University found that a person's likelihood of sharing fake-news articles correlated more strongly with age than it did education, sex, or political views. 11% of users older than 65 shared an article consistent with the study's definition of fake news. Just 3% of users ages 18 to 29 did the same. Another issue in mainstream media is the usage of the filter bubble, a \\"bubble\\" that has been created that gives the viewer, on social media platforms, a specific piece of the information knowing they will like it. Thus creating fake news and biased news because only half the story is being shared, the portion the viewer liked. \\"In 1996, Nicolas Negroponte predicted a world where information technologies become increasingly customizable.\\"  On the Internet  = The roots of fake news = The roots of \\"fake news\\" from UNESCO's World Trends Report The term \\"fake news\\" gained importance with the electoral context in Western Europe and North America.

As fake news was introduced to the Internet, this made it difficult for some people to find truthful information. The impact of fake news has become a worldwide phenomenon. Fake news is often spread through the use of fake news websites, which, in order to gain credibility, specialize in creating attention-grabbing news, which often impersonate well-known news sources. Jestin Coler, who said he does it for \\"fun\\", has indicated that he earned US$10,000 per month from advertising on his fake news websites. In 2017, the inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee claimed that fake news was one of the three most significant new disturbing Internet trends that must first be resolved, if the Internet is to be capable of truly \\"serving humanity.\\" The other two new disturbing trends that Berners-Lee described as threatening the Internet were the recent surge in the use of the Internet by governments for both citizen-surveillance purposes, and for cyber-warfare purposes.The World Wide Web's inventor warns it's in peril on 28th anniversary By Jon Swartz, USA Today. March 11, 2017. Retrieved March 11, 2017. Research has shown that fake news hurts social media and online based outlets far worse than traditional print and TV outlets. After a survey was conducted, it was found that 58% of people had less trust in social media news stories as opposed to 24% of people in mainstream media after learning about fake news. = How fake news spreads and goes viral = Fake news has the tendency to become viral among the public. With the presence of social media platforms like Twitter, it becomes easier for false information to diffuse quickly. Research has found that false political information tends to spread \\"3 times\\" faster than other false news. On Twitter, false tweets have a much higher chance of being retweeted than truthful tweets. More so, it is humans who are responsible in disseminating false news and information as opposed to bots and click-farms. The tendency for humans to spread false information has to do with human behavior; according to research, humans are attracted to events and information that are surprising and new, and, as a result, causes high-arousal in the brain. This ultimately leads humans to retweet or share false information, which are usually characterized with clickbait and eye-catching titles. This prevents people from stopping to verify the information. As a result, massive online communities form around a piece of false news without any prior fact checking or verification of the veracity of the information. The question of how fake news and real news propagate in social network has been studied by Zhao et al. and by Vosoughi et al.. Both studies found difference between propagation of fake news and real news. = Popularity of fake news = Fake news has become popular with various media outlets and platforms. Researchers at Pew Research Center discovered that over 60% of Americans access news through social media compared to traditional newspaper and magazines. With the popularity of social media, individuals can easily access fake news or similar content. One study looks at the number of fake news articles being accessed by viewers in 2016 and found that each individual was exposed to at least one or more fake news articles daily. As a result, fake news is omnipresent among the viewer population and results in its ability to spread across the internet. = Bots on social media = In the mid 1990s, Nicolas Negroponte anticipated a world where news through technology become progressively personalized. In his 1996 book Being Digital he predicted a digital life where news consumption becomes an extremely personalized experience and newspapers adapted content to reader preferences. This prediction has since been reflected in news and social media feeds of modern day. Bots have the potential to increase the spread of fake news, as they use algorithms to decide what articles and information specific users like, without taking into account the authenticity of an article. Bots mass-produce and spread articles, regardless of the credibility of the sources, allowing them to play an essential role in the mass spread of fake news, as bots are capable of creating fake accounts and personalities on the web that are then gaining followers, recognition, and authority. Additionally, almost 30% of the spam and content spread on the Internet originates from these software bots. In the 21st century, the capacity to mislead was enhanced by the widespread use of social media. For example, one 21st century website that enabled fake news' proliferation was the Facebook newsfeed. In late 2016 fake news gained notoriety following the uptick in news content by this means, and its prevalence on the micro-blogging site Twitter. In the United States, 62% of Americans use social media to receive news. Many people use their Facebook news feed to get news, despite Facebook not being considered a news site. According to Craig McClain, over 66% of Facebook users obtain news from the site. This, in combination with increased political polarization and filter bubbles, led to a tendency for readers to mainly read headlines. Numerous individuals and news outlets have stated that fake news may have influenced the outcome of the 2016 American Presidential Election. Fake news saw higher sharing on Facebook than legitimate news stories, which analysts explained was because fake news often panders to expectations or is otherwise more exciting than legitimate news. Facebook itself initially denied this characterization. A Pew Research poll conducted in December 2016 found that 64% of U.S. adults believed completely made-up news had caused \\"a great deal of confusion\\" about the basic facts of current events, while 24% claimed it had caused \\"some confusion\\" and 11% said it had caused \\"not much or no confusion\\". Additionally, 23% of those polled admitted they had personally shared fake news, whether knowingly or not. Researchers from Stanford assessed that only 8% of readers of fake news recalled and believed in the content they were reading, though the same share of readers also recalled and believed in \\"placebos\\"‚Äîstories they did not actually read, but that were produced by the authors of the study. In comparison, over 50% of the participants recalled reading and believed in true news stories. By August 2017 Facebook stopped using the term \\"fake news\\" and used \\"false news\\" in its place instead. Will Oremus of Slate wrote that because supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump had redefined the word \\"fake news\\" to refer to mainstream media opposed to them, \\"it makes sense for Facebook‚Äîand others‚Äîto cede the term to the right- wing trolls who have claimed it as their own.\\" Research from Northwestern University concluded that 30% of all fake news traffic, as opposed to only 8% of real news traffic, could be linked back to Facebook. The research concluded fake news consumers do not exist in a filter bubble; many of them also consume real news from established news sources. The fake news audience is only 10 percent of the real news audience, and most fake news consumers spent a relatively similar amount of time on fake news compared with real news consumers‚Äîwith the exception of Drudge Report readers, who spent more than 11 times longer reading the website than other users. In the wake of western events, China's Ren Xianling of the Cyberspace Administration of China suggested a \\"reward and punish\\" system be implemented to avoid fake news. = Internet trolls = In Internet slang, a troll is a person who sows discord on the Internet by starting arguments or upsetting people, by posting inflammatory, extraneous, or off-topic messages in an online community (such as a newsgroup, forum, chat room, or blog) with the intent of provoking readers into an emotional response or off-topic discussion, often for the troll's amusement. Internet trolls also feed on attention. The idea of internet trolls gained popularity in the 1990s, though its meaning shifted in 2011. Whereas it once denoted provocation, it is a term now widely used to signify the abuse and misuse of the Internet. Trolling comes in various forms, and can be dissected into abuse trolling, entertainment trolling, classical trolling, flame trolling, anonymous trolling, and kudos trolling. It is closely linked to fake news, as internet trolls are now largely interpreted as perpetrators of false information, information that can often be passed along unwittingly by reporters and the public alike. When interacting with each other, trolls often share misleading information that contributes to the fake news circulated on sites like Twitter and Facebook. In the 2016 American election, Russia paid over 1,000 internet trolls to circulate fake news and disinformation about Hillary Clinton; they also created social media accounts that resembled voters in important swing states, spreading influential political standpoints. In February 2019, Glenn Greenwald wrote that a cybersecurity company New Knowledge \\"was caught just six weeks ago engaging in a massive scam to create fictitious Russian troll accounts on Facebook and Twitter in order to claim that the Kremlin was working to defeat Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones in Alabama.\\"  Response  During the 2016 United States presidential election, the creation and coverage of fake news increased substantially. This resulted in a widespread response to combat the spread of fake news. The volume and reluctance of fake news websites to respond to fact- checking organizations has posed a problem to inhibiting the spread of fake news through fact checking alone. In an effort to reduce the effects of fake news, fact-checking websites, including Snopes.com and FactCheck.org, have posted guides to spotting and avoiding fake news websites. New critical readings of media events and news with an emphasis on literalism and logic have also emerged. Social media sites and search engines, such as Facebook and Google, received criticism for facilitating the spread of fake news. Both of these corporations have taken measures to explicitly prevent the spread of fake news; critics, however, believe more action is needed. After the 2016 American election and the run-up to the German election, Facebook began labeling and warning of inaccurate news and partnered with independent fact- checkers to label inaccurate news, warning readers before sharing it. After a story is flagged as disputed, it will be reviewed by the third-party fact- checkers. Then, if it has been proven to be a fake news story, the post cannot be turned into an ad or promoted. Artificial intelligence is one of the more recent technologies being developed in the United States and Europe to recognize and eliminate fake news through algorithms. In 2017, Facebook targeted 30,000 accounts related to the spread of misinformation regarding the French presidential election. In March 2018, Google launched Google News Initiative (GNI) to fight the spread of fake news. It launched GNI under the belief that quality journalism and identifying truth online is crucial. GNI has three goals: \\"to elevate and strengthen quality journalism, evolve business models to drive sustainable growth and empower news organizations through technological innovation\\". To achieve the first goal, Google created the Disinfo Lab, which combats the spread of fake news during crucial times such as elections or breaking news. The company is also working to adjust its systems to display more trustworthy content during times of breaking news. To make it easier for users to subscribe to media publishers, Google created Subscribe with Google. Additionally, they have created a dashboard, News Consumer Insights that allows news organizations to better understand their audiences using data and analytics. Google will spend $300 million through 2021 on these efforts, among others, to combat fake news. Media scholar Dr. Nolan Higdon argues that relying on tech-companies to solve the issues with false information will exacerbate the problems associated with fake news. Higdon contends that tech-companies lack an incentive for solving the problem because they benefit from the proliferation of fake news. Higdon cites tech- companies utilization of data collection as one of the strongest forces empowering fake news producers. Rather than government regulation or industry censorship, Higdon argues for the introduction of critical news literacy education to American education. Algerian lawmakers passed a law criminalising \\"fake news\\" deemed harmful to \\"public order and state security\\". In the Philippines, China, India, Egypt, Bangladesh, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Iran, Montenegro, Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivoire, Somalia, Mauritius, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Malaysia Singapore, and Hong Kong, people have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the COVID-19 pandemic. The Turkish Interior Ministry has been arresting social media users whose posts were \\"targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting the virus had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures\\". Iran's military said 3600 people have been arrested for \\"spreading rumors\\" about COVID-19 in the country. In Cambodia, some individuals who expressed concerns about the spread of COVID-19 have been arrested on fake news charges. The United Arab Emirates have introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the outbreak. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Facebook found that Troll farms from North Macedonia and the Philippines pushed coronavirus disinformation. The publisher which used contents from these farms banned from the platform.  Jair Bolsonaro  President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro has claimed that he will not allow his government to use any of its 1.8 billion reais (US$487 million) media budget on purchases from fake news media. The BBC reported that Bolsonaro's campaign declared media associating his campaign to the \\"extreme right\\" were themselves fake news.  Donald Trump  Donald Trump frequently mentions fake news on Twitter. President Trump has claimed that the mainstream American media regularly reports fake news. His use of the term has increased distrust of the American media globally, particularly in Russia. His claims have given credibility to the stories in the Russian media that label American news, especially news about atrocities committed by the Syrian regime against its own people, where it was quoted that \\"munitions at the air base had as much to do with chemical weapons as the test tube in the hands of Colin Powell had to do with weapons of mass destruction in Iraq\\", as just more fake American news. Trump has carried on a war against the mainstream media, often attacking it as \\"fake news\\" and the \\"enemy of the people.\\" According to Jeff Hemsley, a Syracuse University professor who studies social media, Trump uses this term for any news that is not favorable to him or which he simply dislikes. Trump provided a widely cited example of this interpretation in a tweet on May 9, 2018: Chris Cillizza described the tweet on CNN as an \\"accidental\\" revelation about Trump's \\"'fake news' attacks\\", and wrote: \\"The point can be summed up in these two words from Trump: 'negative (Fake).' To Trump, those words mean the same thing. Negative news coverage is fake news. Fake news is negative news coverage.\\" Other writers made similar comments about the tweet. Dara Lind wrote in Vox: \\"It's nice of Trump to admit, explicitly, what many skeptics have suspected all along: When he complains about 'fake news,' he doesn't actually mean 'news that is untrue'; he means news that is personally inconvenient to Donald Trump.\\" Jonathan Chait wrote in New York magazine: \\"Trump admits he calls all negative news 'fake'.\\": \\"In a tweet this morning, Trump casually opened a window into the source code for his method of identifying liberal media bias. Anything that's negative is, by definition, fake.\\" Philip Bump wrote in The Washington Post: \\"The important thing in that tweet... is that he makes explicit his view of what constitutes fake news. It's negative news. Negative. (Fake.)\\" In an interview with Lesley Stahl, before the cameras were turned on, Trump explained why he attacks the press: \\"You know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all so that when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you.\\" Author and literary critic Michiko Kakutani has described developments in the right-wing media and websites: In September 2018, National Public Radio noted that Trump has expanded his use of the terms \\"fake\\" and \\"phony\\" to \\"an increasingly wide variety of things he doesn't like\\": \\"The range of things Trump is declaring fake is growing too. Last month he tweeted about \\"fake books,\\" \\"the fake dossier,\\" \\"fake CNN,\\" and he added a new claim‚Äîthat Google search results are \\"RIGGED\\" to mostly show only negative stories about him.\\" They graphed his expanding use in columns labeled: \\"Fake news\\", \\"Fake (other) and \\"Phony\\".  Criticism of the term  Because of the manner in which Trump has co-opted the term, Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan has warned fellow journalists that \\"It's time to retire the tainted term 'fake news'. Though the term hasn't been around long, its meaning already is lost.\\" By late 2018, the term \\"fake news\\" had become verboten and U.S. journalists, including the Poynter Institute were asking for apologies and for product retirements from companies using the term. In October 2018, the British government decided that the term \\"fake news\\" will no longer be used in official documents because it is \\"a poorly-defined and misleading term that conflates a variety of false information, from genuine error through to foreign interference in democratic processes.\\" This followed a recommendation by the House of Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee to avoid the term.  By country   Armenia  According to a report by openDemocracy in 2020, the Armenian website Medmedia.am was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, calling COVID-19 a ‚Äúfake pandemic‚Äù and warning Armenians to refuse future vaccine programmes. The website is led by Gevorg Grigoryan, a doctor who has been critical of the Armenian government's health ministry and its vaccine programmes, and has a history of anti-LGBT statements, including remarks posted on Facebook in which he called for gay people to be burned. The Guardian newspaper said the site was launched with the unwitting help of a US State Department grant intended to promote democracy.  Australia  A well-known case of fabricated news in Australia happened in 2009 when a report Deception Detection Across Australian Populations of a \\"Levitt Institute\\" was widely cited on news websites across the country, claiming that Sydney was the most naive city, despite the fact that the report itself contained a clue: amidst the mathematical gibberish, there was a statement: \\"These results were completely made up to be fictitious material through a process of modified truth and credibility nodes.\\"\\"Deception Detection Deficiency\\", Media Watch, episode 34, September 28, 2009, ABC TV The Australian Parliament initiated investigation into \\"fake news\\" regarding issues surrounding fake news that occurred during the 2016 United States election. The inquiry looked at several major areas in Australia to find audiences most vulnerable to fake news, by considering the impact on traditional journalism, and by evaluating the liability of online advertisers and by regulating the spreading the hoaxes. This act of parliament is meant to combat the threat of social media power on spreading fake news as concluded negative results to the public.Remeikis, A. (2017). \\"Parliament to launch inquiry into 'fake news' in Australia\\", The Sydney Morning Herald.  Austria  Politicians in Austria dealt with the impact of fake news and its spread on social media after the 2016 presidential campaign in the country. In December 2016, a court in Austria issued an injunction on Facebook Europe, mandating it block negative postings related to Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek, Austrian Green Party Chairwoman. According to The Washington Post the postings to Facebook about her \\"appeared to have been spread via a fake profile\\" and directed derogatory epithets towards the Austrian politician.Kirchner, Stephanie (December 14, 2016), \\"Menace of fake news is rattling politicians in Austria and Germany\\", The Washington Post, retrieved December 14, 2016. The derogatory postings were likely created by the identical fake profile that had previously been utilized to attack Alexander van der Bellen, who won the election for President of Austria.  Belgium  In 2006, French-speaking broadcaster RTBF showed a fictional breaking special news report that Belgium's Flemish Region had proclaimed independence. Staged footage of the royal family evacuating and the Belgian flag being lowered from a pole were made to add credence to the report. It wasn't until 30 minutes into the report that a sign stating \\"Fiction\\" appeared on screen. The RTBF journalist that created the hoax said the purpose was to demonstrate the magnitude of the country's situation and if a partition of Belgium was to really happen.  Brazil  Brazil faced increasing influence from fake news after the 2014 re- election of President Dilma Rousseff and Rousseff's subsequent impeachment in August 2016. BBC Brazil reported in April 2016 that in the week surrounding one of the impeachment votes, three out of the five most-shared articles on Facebook in Brazil were fake. In 2015, reporter Tai Nalon resigned from her position at Brazilian newspaper Folha de S Paulo in order to start the first fact-checking website in Brazil, called Aos Fatos (To The Facts). Nalon told The Guardian there was a great deal of fake news, and hesitated to compare the problem to that experienced in the U.S.Kate Connolly; Angelique Chrisafis; Poppy McPherson; Stephanie Kirchgaessner; Benjamin Haas; Dominic Phillips; Elle Hunt (December 2, 2016). \\"Fake news: an insidious trend that's fast becoming a global problem ‚Äì With fake online 1news dominating discussions after the US election, Guardian correspondents explain how it is distorting politics around the world\\". The Guardian. Retrieved December 2, 2016. In fact, Brazil also have problems with fake news and according to a survey have a greater number of people that believe fake news influenced the outcome of their elections (69%) than the United States (47%). In the wake of the uptick in Amazon fires of 2019, it became clear that many of the forest fire photos that went viral were fake news. Emmanuel Macron, president of France, tweeted picture taken by a photographer who died in 2003, for example.  Canada  Fake news online was brought to the attention of Canadian politicians in November 2016, as they debated helping assist local newspapers. Member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre Hedy Fry specifically discussed fake news as an example of ways in which publishers on the Internet are less accountable than print media. Discussion in parliament contrasted increase of fake news online with downsizing of Canadian newspapers and the impact for democracy in Canada. Representatives from Facebook Canada attended the meeting and told members of Parliament they felt it was their duty to assist individuals gather data online.Cheadle, Bruce (November 17, 2016), \\"As fake news spreads, MPs consider importance of Canada's local papers\\", CTV News, The Canadian Press, retrieved December 11, 2016. In January 2017, the Conservative leadership campaign of Kellie Leitch admitted to spreading fake news, including false claims that Justin Trudeau was financing Hamas. The campaign manager claimed he spread the news in order to provoke negative reactions so that he could determine those who \\"aren't real Conservatives\\".\\"Inside Nick Kouvalis's fake news strategy\\".  China  Note: Hong Kong and the Republic of China on Taiwan are discussed in separate sections Fake news during the 2016 U.S. election spread to China. Articles popularized within the United States were translated into Chinese and spread within China. The government of China used the growing problem of fake news as a rationale for increasing Internet censorship in China in November 2016.Orlowski, Andrew (November 21, 2016), \\"China cites Trump to justify 'fake news' media clampdown. Surprised?\\", The Register, retrieved November 28, 2016. China then published an editorial in its Communist Party newspaper The Global Times called: \\"Western Media's Crusade Against Facebook\\", and criticized \\"unpredictable\\" political problems posed by freedoms enjoyed by users of Twitter, Google, and Facebook. China government leaders meeting in Wuzhen at the third World Internet Conference in November 2016 said fake news in the U.S. election justified adding more curbs to free and open use of the Internet. China Deputy Minister Ren Xianliang, official at the Cyberspace Administration of China, said increasing online participation led to \\"harmful information\\" and fraud.Pascaline, Mary (November 20, 2016), \\"Facebook Fake News Stories: China Calls For More Censorship On Internet Following Social Media's Alleged Role In US Election\\", International Business Times, retrieved November 28, 2016.

So does China.\\", The Washington Post, retrieved November 28, 2016. The Wall Street Journal noted China's themes of Internet censorship became more relevant at the World Internet Conference due to the outgrowth of fake news.Dou, Eva (November 18, 2016), \\"China Presses Tech Firms to Police the Internet‚ÄîThird-annual World Internet Conference aimed at proselytizing China's view to global audience\\", The Wall Street Journal, retrieved November 28, 2016. The issue of fake news in the 2016 United States election gave the Chinese Government a reason to further criticize Western democracy and press freedom. The Chinese government accused Western media organisations of bias, in a move apparently inspired by President Trump. In March 2017, the People's Daily, a newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party of China, denounced news coverage of the torture of Chinese lawyer and human rights advocate Xie Yang, claiming it to be fake news. The newspaper published a Twitter post declaring that \\"Foreign media reports that police tortured a detained lawyer is FAKE NEWS, fabricated to tarnish China's image\\". The state- owned Xinhua News Agency claimed that \\"the stories were essentially fake news\\". The Chinese government often accused Western news organizations of being biased and dishonest. The Chinese government also claimed that there were people who posed as journalists who spread negative information on social media in order to extort payment from their victims to stop doing so. David Bandurski of University of Hong Kong's China Media Project said that this issue continued to worsen. Taiwan's leaders, including President Tsai Ing-wen and Premier William Lai, accused China's troll army of spreading \\"fake news\\" via social media to support candidates more sympathetic to Beijing ahead of the 2018 Taiwanese local elections.  Colombia  In the fall of 2016, Whatsapp spread fake news that impacted votes critical to Colombian history. One of the lies spreading rapidly through WhatsApp was that Colombian citizens would receive less pension so former guerrilla fighters would get money. The misinformation initially began in a question to whether Whatsapp users approved of the peace accord deal between the national government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or did not. The peace accord would end five decades of war between paramilitary groups (rebel forces) and the Colombian government that resulted in millions of deaths and displaced citizens throughout the country. A powerful influence of votes was the \\"no\\" campaign, the \\"no\\" campaign was to convince citizens of Colombia to not accept the peace accord because it would be letting the rebel group off \\"too easily.\\" Uribe, former president of Colombia and of the democratico party, led the \\"no\\" campaign. Santos, president in 2016 took liberal approaches during his presidency. Santos won a Nobel Peace Prize in 2016 because of his efforts towards a peace accord with rebel forces. In addition, Uribe naturally had opposing views than of Santos. Furthermore, other news spread through whatsapp were easily misinterpreted by the public, including that Santo's scheme was to turn Colombia under harsh rule like Cuba and chaos like Venezuela (under Hugo Ch√°vez), though the logistics were never explained. In an interview of Juan Carlos V√©lez, the \\"no\\" campaign manager, he says their strategy was that \\"We discovered the viral power of social networks.\\" In addition, the yes campaign also took part in spreading fake news through whatsapp. For instance, a photoshopped image of a democratico senator Everth Bustamante spread about of him holding a sign reading \\"I don't want guirrellas in congress\\" to show hypocrisy. This would be seen as hypocritical because he was a former left wing M-19 guerrilla. The \\"no\\" campaign strongly influenced votes throughout Colombia, Yes votes strong in areas with highest number of victims and no votes in areas influenced by Uribe. In result, there were 50.2 percent of no votes compared to 49.8 percent of yes votes. The result of the fake news throughout Whatsapp included changes within WhatsApp by Journalist, Juanita Leon, who invented the Whatsapp \\"lie detector\\" in January 2017 to fight fake news within the app. Although the accord was eventually signed, the WhatsApp incident further prolonged the accord and brought controversial views among citizens.  Czech Republic  Fake news outlets in the Czech Republic redistribute news in Czech and English originally produced by Russian sources. Czech president Milo≈° Zeman has been supporting media outlets accused of spreading fake news. The Centre Against Terrorism and Hybrid Threats (CTHH) is unit of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic primarily aimed at countering disinformation, fake news, hoaxes and foreign propaganda. The CTHH started operations on January 1, 2017. The CTHH has been criticized by Czech President Milo≈° Zeman, who said: \\"We don't need censorship. We don't need thought police. We don't need a new agency for press and information as long as we want to live in a free and democratic society.\\"\\"Czech Republic open centre to fight fake news\\". Sky News. January 2, 2017. In 2017 media activists started a website Konspiratori.cz maintaining a list of conspiracy and fake news outlets in Czech.  Finland  Officials from 11 countries met in Helsinki in November 2016 and planned the formation of a center to combat disinformation cyber-warfare, which includes the spread of fake news on social media. The center is planned to be located in Helsinki and combine efforts from 10 countries, including Sweden, Germany, Finland and the U.S. Prime Minister of Finland from 2015 to 2019 Juha Sipil√§ planned to address the topic of the center in Spring 2017 with a motion before Parliament. Deputy Secretary of State for EU Affairs Jori Arvonen said cyber-warfare, such as hybrid cyber- warfare intrusions into Finland from Russia and the Islamic State, became an increased problem in 2016. Arvonen cited examples including online fake news, disinformation, and the little green men troops of the Ukrainian crisis.\\"Helsinki to host hub aimed at curbing cyber warfare threats\\", Yle, November 21, 2016, retrieved December 11, 2016.  France  During the ten- year period preceding 2016, France was witness to an increase in popularity of far-right alternative news sources called the fachosphere (\\"facho\\" referring to fascist); known as the . According to sociologist Antoine Bevort, citing data from Alexa Internet rankings, the most consulted political websites in France in 2016 included √âgalit√© et R√©conciliation, ', and Les Moutons Enrag√©s. These sites increased skepticism towards mainstream media from both left and right perspectives. In September 2016, the country faced controversy regarding fake websites providing false information about abortion. The National Assembly moved forward with intentions to ban such fake sites. Laurence Rossignol, women's minister for France, informed parliament though the fake sites look neutral, in actuality their intentions were specifically targeted to give women fake information. = 2017 presidential election = France saw an uptick in amounts of disinformation and propaganda, primarily in the midst of election cycles. A study looking at the diffusion of political news during the 2017 presidential election cycle suggests that one in four links shared in social media comes from sources that actively contest traditional media narratives. Facebook corporate deleted 30,000 Facebook accounts in France associated with fake political information. In April 2017, Emmanuel Macron's presidential campaign was attacked by the fake news articles more than the campaigns of conservative candidate Marine Le Pen and socialist candidate . One of the fake articles even announced that Marine Le Pen won the presidency before the people of France had even voted. Macron's professional and private emails, as well as memos, contracts and accounting documents were posted on a file sharing website. The leaked documents were mixed with fake ones in social media in an attempt to sway the upcoming presidential election. Macron said he would combat fake news of the sort that had been spread during his election campaign. Initially, the leak was attributed to APT28, a group tied to Russia's GRU military intelligence directorate. However, the head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that there was no evidence that the hack leading to the leaks had anything to do with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that \\"we can imagine that it was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country.\\"  Germany  German Chancellor Angela Merkel lamented the problem of fraudulent news reports in a November 2016 speech, days after announcing her campaign for a fourth term as leader of her country. In a speech to the German parliament, Merkel was critical of such fake sites, saying they harmed political discussion. Merkel called attention to the need of government to deal with Internet trolls, bots, and fake news websites. She warned that such fraudulent news websites were a force increasing the power of populist extremism. Merkel called fraudulent news a growing phenomenon that might need to be regulated in the future. Germany's foreign intelligence agency Federal Intelligence Service Chief, Bruno Kahl, warned of the potential for cyberattacks by Russia in the 2017 German election. He said the cyberattacks would take the form of the intentional spread of disinformation. Kahl said the goal is to increase chaos in political debates. Germany's domestic intelligence agency Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution Chief, Hans-Georg Maassen, said sabotage by Russian intelligence was a present threat to German information security.Murdock, Jason (November 30, 2016), \\"Russian hackers may disrupt Germany's 2017 election warns spy chief\\", International Business Times UK edition, retrieved December 1, 2016. German government officials and security experts later said there was no Russian interference during the 2017 German federal election.\\"Germany sees no sign of cyber attack before Sept. 24 election\\". Reuters. 19 September 2017. The German term L√ºgenpresse, or lying press, has been used since the 19th century and specifically during World War One as a strategy to attack news spread by political opponents from the 19th and 20th century. The award-winning German journalist Claas Relotius resigned from Der Spiegel in 2018 after admitting numerous instances of journalistic fraud. In early April 2020, Berlin politician Andreas Geisel alleged that a shipment of 200,000 N95 masks that it had ordered from American producer 3M's China facility were intercepted in Bangkok and diverted to the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Berlin police president Barbara Slowik stated that she believed \\"this is related to the US government's export ban.\\" However, Berlin police confirmed that the shipment was not seized by U.S. authorities, but was said to have simply been bought at a better price, widely believed to be from a German dealer or China. This revelation outraged the Berlin opposition, whose CDU parliamentary group leader Burkard Dregger accused Geisel of \\"deliberately misleading Berliners\\" in order \\"to cover up its own inability to obtain protective equipment\\". FDP interior expert Marcel Luthe said \\"Big names in international politics like Berlin's senator Geisel are blaming others and telling US piracy to serve anti-American clich√©s.\\" Politico Europe reported that \\"the Berliners are taking a page straight out of the Trump playbook and not letting facts get in the way of a good story.\\"  Hong Kong  During the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, the Chinese government has been accused for using fake news to spread misinformation regarding the protests. It includes describing protests as \\"riots\\", and \\"radicals\\" seeking independence for the city. Due to the online censorship in China, citizens inside mainland China could not read news reports from some media outlets. It was also found by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube that misinformation was spread with fake accounts and advertisements by state-backed media. Large amount of accounts were suspended. Dot Dot News, a pro-Beijing online media located in Hong Kong, has been banned by Facebook given it has been distributing fake news and hate speech.„ÄÇ  India  Fake news in India has led to violent incidents between castes and religions, interfering with public policies. It often spreads through the smartphone instant messenger WhatsApp, which had 200 million monthly active users in the country . See also Indian WhatsApp lynchings.  Indonesia  Recently, Indonesia has seen an increase in the amount of fake news circulating social media. The problem first arose during their 2014 presidential election, where the eventual-winning candidate Joko Widodo became a target of a smear campaign by Prabowo Subianto's supporters which falsely claimed he was the child of Indonesian Communist Party members, of Chinese descent, and a Christian. Unlike the 2016 U.S. presidential election, where the sharing of fake news resulted in increased social-media engagement than real news, inflaming ethnic and political tensions could be potentially deadly in Indonesia, with its recent incidences of domestic terrorism, and its long and bloody history of anti-communist, anti-Christian and anti-Chinese pogroms cultivated by Suharto's U.S.-backed right-wing dictatorship which ran the country for thirty-some years. Suharto was also Prabowo's father in-law for the last 15 years of the regime. The government, watchdog groups, and even religious organizations have taken steps to prevent its spreading, such as blocking certain websites and creating fact-check apps. The largest Islamic mass organization in Indonesia, Nahdlatul Ulama, has created an anti-fake news campaign called #TurnBackHoax, while other Islamic groups have defined such propagation as tantamount to a sin. While the government currently views criminal punishment as its last resort, officials are working hard to guarantee law enforcement will respect the freedom of expression. The fake news campaign rose again in the 2019 presidential election, which involved the same sides competing last time out. For years, most fake news circulated in Indonesia are related to alleged Chinese imperialism (including Sinicization), communization, and Christianization. It was made worse by the 2016‚Äì17 Jakarta protests led by Islamic fundamentalist groups such as the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) which successfully imprisoned Jakarta Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, who happens to be a Chinese- Christian.  Israel/Palestinian Territories  In 1996, people had been killed in the Western Wall Tunnel riots in reaction to fake news accounts. An Egyptian newspaper reported on Israeli spy sharks trained to eat Arab bathers in the Red Sea, an example of an Israel-related animal conspiracy theory. The Israeli state has been accused of spreading propaganda in the U.S. In April 2018, Palestinian-Israeli football team Bnei Sakhnin threatened to sue Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for libel, after he claimed fans booed during a minute of silence for Israeli flash-flood victims. In a social media post, Netanyahu blasted various Israeli news critical of him, as fake news including Channel 2, Channel 10, Haaretz and Ynet the same day U.S. President Trump decried \\"fake news\\". The Palestinian Islamist political organization, Hamas published a political program in 2017 intended to ease its position on Israel. Among other things, this charter accepted the borders of the Palestinian state circa the Six-Day War of 1967. Although this document is an advancement from their previous 1988 charter, which called for the destruction of the State of Israel, it still does not recognize Israel as legitimate independent nation. In a video, Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu responded to the coverage of this event by news outlets such as Al Jazeera, CNN, New York Times and The Guardian, calling their reporting fake news. He specifically disagreed with the notion that Hamas had accepted the state of Israel within their new charter, and called this \\"a complete distortion of the truth\\". Instead he said, \\"The new Hamas document says Israel has no right to exist.\\" In a later speech, addressed to his supporters, Netanyahu responded to allegations against him: \\"The fake news industry is at its peak... Look, for example, how they cover with unlimited enthusiasm, every week, the left-wing demonstration. The same demonstrations whose goal is to apply improper pressure on law enforcement authorities so they will file an indictment at any price.\\" Observers likened his blanketed use of the term, 'fake news', for describing left-wing media to Donald Trump, and his similar statements during the 2016 election cycle. In a most recent studies conducted by Yifat Media Check Ltd. and Hamashrokit (\\"The Whistle\\" fact-checking NGO), they found that over 70% of statements made by Israeli political leaders were not accurate.  Malaysia  In April 2018, Malaysia implemented the Anti-Fake News Bill 2018, a controversial law that deemed publishing and circulating misleading information as a crime punishable by up to six years in prison and/or fines of up to 500,000 ringgit. At implementation, the country's prime minister was Najib Razak, whose associates were connected to the mishandling of at least $3.5 billion by a United States Department of Justice report. Of that sum of money, $731 million was deposited into bank accounts controlled by Razak. The convergence between the fake news law and Razak's connection to scandal was made clear by the Malaysian minister of communications and multimedia, Salleh Said Keruak, who said that tying Razak to a specific dollar amount could be a prosecutable offense. In the 2018 Malaysian general election, Najib Razak lost his seat as prime minister to Mahatir Mohammad, who vowed to abolish the fake news law in his campaign, as the law was used to target him. After winning the election, the newly elected prime minister Mohammad has said, \\"Even though we support freedom of press and freedom of speech, there are limits.\\" , Mohammad has supported amending the law, rather than a full abolition. Paul Bernal, a lecturer in information and technology, fears that the fake news epidemic is a \\"Trojan horse\\" for countries like Malaysia to \\"control uncomfortable stories\\". The vagueness of this law means that satirists, opinion writers, and journalists who make errors could face persecution. The law also makes it illegal to share fake news stories. In one instance, a Danish man and Malaysian citizen were arrested for posting false news stories online and were sentenced to serve a month in jail.  Mexico   Myanmar  In 2015, BBC News reported on fake stories, using unrelated photographs and fraudulent captions, shared online in support of the Rohingya.\\"The fake pictures of the Rohingya crisis\\", BBC News, June 6, 2015, retrieved December 8, 2016. Fake news negatively affected individuals in Myanmar, leading to a rise in violence against Muslims in the country. Online participation surged from one percent to 20 percent of Myanmar's total populace from 2014 to 2016. Fake stories from Facebook were reprinted in paper periodicals called Facebook and The Internet. False reporting related to practitioners of Islam in the country was directly correlated with increased attacks on Muslims in Myanmar. BuzzFeed journalist Sheera Frenkel reported fake news fictitiously stated believers in Islam acted out in violence at Buddhist locations. She documented a direct relationship between the fake news and violence against Muslim people. Frenkel noted countries that were relatively newer to Internet exposure were more vulnerable to the problems of fake news and fraud.  Netherlands  In March 2018, the European Union's East StratCom Team compiled a list dubbed a \\"hall of shame\\" of articles with suspected Kremlin attempts to influence political decisions. However, controversy arose when three Dutch media outlets claimed they had been wrongfully singled out because of quotes attributed to people with non- mainstream views. The news outlets included [1]Post Online, GeenStijl, and De Gelderlander. All three were flagged for publishing articles critical of Ukrainian policies, and none received any forewarning or opportunity to appeal beforehand. This incident has contributed to the growing issue of what defines news as fake, and how freedoms of press and speech can be protected during attempts to curb to spread of false news.

Politicians have started filing laws to combat fake news and three Senate hearings have been held on the topic. The Catholic Church in the Philippines has also released a missive speaking out against it. Vera Files research at the end of 2017 and 2018 show that the most shared fake news in the Philippines appeared to benefit 2 people the most: President Rodrigo Duterte (as well as his allies) and politician Bongbong Marcos, with the most viral news driven by shares on networks of Facebook pages. Most Philippine audience Facebook pages and groups spreading online disinformation also bear \\"Duterte\\", \\"Marcos\\" or \\"News\\" in their names and are pro-Duterte. Online disinformation in the Philippines is overwhelmingly political as well, with most attacking groups or individuals critical of the Duterte administration. Many Philippine-audience fake news websites also appear to be controlled by the same operators as they share common Google Adsense and Google Analytics IDs. According to media scholar Jonathan Corpus Ong, Duterte's presidential campaign is regarded as the patient zero in the current era of disinformation, having preceded widespread global coverage of the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Russian trolls. Fake news is so established and severe in the Philippines that Facebook's Global Politics and Government Outreach Director Katie Harbath also calls it \\"patient zero\\" in the global misinformation epidemic, having happened before Brexit, the Trump nomination and the 2016 US Elections.  Poland  Polish historian noted fake news websites had infiltrated Poland through anti-establishment and right-wing sources that copied content from Russia Today. Targalski observed there existed about 20 specific fake news websites in Poland that spread Russian disinformation in the form of fake news. One example cited was fake news that Ukraine announced the Polish city of Przemy≈õl as occupied Polish land.\\"Russian propaganda entering mainstream news: disinformation experts\\", Radio Poland, November 18, 2016, retrieved December 11, 2016.

Romania  On 16 March 2020, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis signed an emergency decree, giving authorities the power to remove, report or close websites spreading \\"fake news\\" about the COVID-19 pandemic, with no opportunity to appeal.  Russia  In March 2019, Russia passed a new bill to ban websites from spreading false information. In addition to tackling fake news, the new legislation specifically punishes any sources or websites for publishing materials that insult the state, the symbol of the government or other political figures. For repeated offenders, they would receive a 15-day jail sentence.  Saudi Arabia  According to the Global News, Saudi Arabia's state-owned television spread fake news about Canada. In August 2018, Canada's Global News reported that state-owned television Al Arabiya, \\"has suggested that Canada is the worst country in the world for women, that it has the highest suicide rate and that it treats its Indigenous people the way Myanmar treats the Rohingya‚Äîa Muslim minority massacred and driven out of Myanmar en masse last year.\\" In October 2018, Twitter has suspended a number of bot accounts that appeared to be spreading pro-Saudi rhetoric about the disappearance of Saudi opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi. According to Newsweek, Saudi Arabia's Office of Public Prosecution tweeted that \\"producing rumors or fake news [that Saudi Arabia's government was involved in the disappearance of Khashoggi] that would affect the public order or public security or sending or resending it via social media or any technical means\\" is punishable \\"by five years and a fine of 3million riyals\\". Iranian-backed Twitter accounts spread sensational fake news and rumours about Saudi Arabia. On August 1, 2019, Facebook identified hundreds of accounts that were running a covert network on behalf of government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to spread fake news and attack regional rivals. The social media giant removed more than 350 accounts, pages and groups with nearly 1.4 million followers. Along with Facebook, these accounts were involved in \\"coordinated inauthentic behavior\\" on Instagram as well. According to a Facebook blog post, the network was running two different political agendas, one on behalf of Saudi Arabia and the other for the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.  Serbia  In 2018, International Research & Exchanges Board described the situation in the media in Serbia as the worst in recent history, and that Media Sustainability Index dropped because the most polarized media in almost 20 years, an increase in fake news and editorial pressure on media. According to Serbian investigative journalism portal Crime and Corruption Reporting Network, more than 700 fake news were published on the front pages of pro-government tabloids during 2018. Many of them were about alleged attacks on the president Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and attempts of coups, as well as messages of support to him by Vladimir Putin. The best-selling newspaper in Serbia is the pro-government tabloid Informer, which most often presents Vuƒçiƒá as a powerful person under constant attack, and also has anti- European content and pro-war rhetoric. Since Vuƒçiƒá's party came to power, Serbia has seen a surge of internet trolls and pages on social networks praising the government and attacking its critics, free media and the opposition in general. That includes a handful of dedicated employees run fake accounts, but also the Facebook page associated with a Serbian franchise of the far-right Breitbart News website, which has a disputed accuracy.  Singapore  Singapore criminalizes the propagation of fake news.

The image was created by a student to demonstrate to his classmates how fake news could be easily created and propagated. In 2017, Singaporean news website Mothership.sg was criticized by the Ministry of Education (MOE) for propagating remarks falsely attributed to a MOE official. In addition, Minister of Law K Shanmugam also singled out online news website The States Times Review as an example of a source of fake news, as it once claimed a near-zero turnout at the state funeral of President S.

In 2017, the Ministry of Communications and Information set up Factually, a website intended to debunk false rumors regarding issues of public interest such as the environment, housing and transport, while in 2018, the Parliament of Singapore formed a Select Committee to consider new legislation to tackle fake news. Furthermore, the Singapore government has introduced draft legislation with regards to Fake News in April 2019, which is called the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill. This legislation is intended to regulate websites that spread misinformation, and combat fake news. In addition, this bill is supported by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's People's Action Party, which has a super majority in Parliament. However, critics also point out that this bill could introduce government's self censorship and increase government's control over social media. Activist platform The Online Citizen regarded legislation against fake news as an attempt by the government to curb the free flow of information so that only information approved by the government is disseminated to the public. In an online essay, activist and historian Thum Ping Tjin denied that fake news was a problem in Singapore, and accused the People's Action Party government as the only major source of fake news, claiming that detentions made without trial during Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum were based on fake news for party political gain. Facebook and Google have opposed the introduction of new laws to combat fake news, claiming that existing legislation is adequate to address the problem and that an effective way of combating misinformation is through educating citizens on how to distinguish reliable from unreliable information.  South Africa  A wide range of South African media sources have reported fake news as a growing problem and tool to both increase distrust in the media, discredit political opponents, and divert attention from corruption.Daniels, Glenda (February 15, 2017). \\"How fake news works as political machinery to tarnish the integrity of journalists\\".

Spain  Fake news in Spain has become much more prevalent in the 2010s, but has been prominent throughout Spain's history. The United States government published a fake article in regards to the purchase of the Philippines from Spain, which they had already purchased. Despite this, the topic of fake news has traditionally not been given much attention to in Spain, until the newspaper El Pa√≠s launched the new blog dedicated strictly to truthful news entitled \\"Hechos\\"; which literally translates to \\"fact\\" in Spanish. David Alandete, the managing editor of El Pa√≠s, stated how many people misinterpret fake news as real because the sites \\"have similar names, typography, layouts and are deliberately confusing\\" (Southern). Alandete made it the new mission of El Pa√≠s \\"to respond to fake news\\" (Scott). Mar√≠a Ram√≠rez of Univision Communications has stated that much of the political fake news circulating in Spain is due to the lack of investigative journalism on the topics. Most recently El Pa√≠s has created a fact-checking position for five employees, to try and debunk the fake news released.  Sweden  The Swedish Security Service issued a report in 2015 identifying propaganda from Russia infiltrating Sweden with the objective to amplify pro-Russian propaganda and inflame societal conflicts. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), part of the Ministry of Defence of Sweden, identified fake news reports targeting Sweden in 2016 that originated from Russia. Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency official Mikael Tofvesson stated a pattern emerged where views critical of Sweden were constantly repeated. The Local identified these tactics as a form of psychological warfare. The newspaper reported the MSB identified Russia Today and Sputnik News as significant fake news purveyors. As a result of growth in this propaganda in Sweden, the MSB planned to hire six additional security officials to fight back against the campaign of fraudulent information.\\"Concern over barrage of fake Russian news in Sweden\\", The Local, July 27, 2016, retrieved November 25, 2016.

Syrian president Bashar al-Assad questioned the credibility of Amnesty International and called the report \\"fake news\\" fabricated to undermine the government. \\"You can forge anything these days‚Äîwe are living in a fake news era.\\" Russia ran a disinformation campaign during the Syrian Civil War to discredit the humanitarian rescue organisation White Helmets, and to discredit reports and images of children and other civilian bombing victims. This was done to weaken criticism of Russia's involvement in the war. The United Nations and international chemical inspectors found Bashar al-Assad responsible for use of chemical weapons, which was called \\"fake news\\" by Russia. Russia promoted various contradictory claims that no chemicals were present, or attributing the chemical attacks to other countries or groups.  Taiwan  In a report in December 2015 by The China Post, a fake video shared online showed people a light show purportedly made at the Shihmen Reservoir. The Northern Region Water Resources Office confirmed there was no light show at the reservoir and the event had been fabricated. The fraud led to an increase in tourist visits to the actual attraction. According to the news updated paper from the Time World in regards the global threat to free speech, the Taiwanese government has reformed its policy on education and it will include \\"media literacy\\" as one part of school curriculum for the students. It will be included to develop the critical thinking skills needed while using social media.

The recurring theme of these fake news was that Russia was solely to blame for the crisis and the war in Donbass. In 2015 the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe published a report criticizing Russian disinformation campaigns to disrupt relations between Europe and Ukraine after ouster of Viktor Yanukovych. According to Deutsche Welle, similar tactics were used by fake news websites during the U.S. elections.

Attached to the oxetane ring of technically relevant alkyl ketene dimers there is a C12 ‚Äì C16 alkyl group in the 3-position and a C13 ‚Äì C17 alkylidene group in the 4-position. The main application of alkylated ketene dimers is in the sizing of paper and cardboard, as well as in the hydrophobation of cellulose fibers. The products thus modified are distinguished by higher mechanical strengths and less penetration of water, inks or printing inks. AKD's feature hydrophobic alkyl groups extending from a beta-propiolactone ring. A specific example is derived from the dimerization of the ketene of stearic acid. This ketene is generated by pyrolysis of stearoyl chloride.Raimund Miller, Claudio Abaecherli, Adel Said, Barry Jackson \\"Ketenes\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2001, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. AKD's react with the hydroxyl groups on the cellulose via esterification reaction. The esterification is competitive with hydrolysis of the AKD. Prior to the development of AKD's, hydrophobicity was imparted by incorporating rosin into the paper.Werner J. Auhorn \\"Paper and Board, 3. Chemical Additives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. 2012. Related to AKDs, is alkenylsuccinic anhydride (ASA). As for AKDs, ASA reacts with hydroxy groups of the cellulose to form an ester, anchoring the hydrophobic group to the surface. ASA is prepared by the ene reaction of unsaturated hydrocarbons with maleic anhydride.  History  As early as 1901, Edgar Wedekind published the synthesis of alkyl ketene dimers by the reaction of carboxylic acid chlorides with tertiary amines, the reaction products for polymers. Synthese von Alkylketendimeren (AKD) The molecular weight determined by the early researchers did indicate a multiple of the group R1R2CH=C=O. Therefore, a so-called pyronone (a diketone structure with a cyclobutane ring) was proposed as reaction product, e. g. from the reaction of isobutyryl chloride and triethylamine. Alternative Strukturen von Dimerisierungsprodukten The primary reaction products of carboxylic acid chlorides with hydrogen atoms in Œ±-position and tertiary amines were identified by Hermann Staudinger and Norman Thomas Mortimer Wilsmore as highly reactive ketenes (ethenones) which form 2-oxetanones with an alkylidene group when dimerizing in a [2+2] photocycloadditions. This gradually brought clarity about the constitution of alkylated ketene dimers. The clarification of the constitution was complicated by different dimerization products of the ketenes. For example, the simple ketene (H2C=C=O) dimerizes to diketene (4-methylen-oxetan-2-one), while substituted ketenes, such as dimethyl ketene (Me2C=C=O, formed from isobutyryl chloride with triethylamine) dimerize in a head-to-tail addition to 2,2,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutanedione. Dimerisierung von Dimethylketen zum Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutandion The 2,2,4,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutanedione can easily be isomerized to dimethyl ketene dimer (4-isopropylidene-3,3-dimethyl-oxetan-2-one). Isomerisierung von Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutandion zum Dimethylketendimer The synthesis and characterization of hexadecyl ketene dimer, a key substance for alkylated ketene dimers used in the paper industry, was first described in a patent in 1945 and in a publication in 1947. A quantum-chemical study rejected the formation of a cyclobutanedione during the dimerization of n-alkylketene R-CH=C=O in favour of the formation of the thermodynamically more stable oxetan-2-one structure.  Preparation  The industrial synthesis of alkylated ketenedimers (at that time still called ketoethenones) was patented in 1945 from long-chain carboxylic acid chlorides in inert solvents (such as diethyl ether or benzene) with triethylamine as tertiary amine under anhydrous conditions. After filtration of the insoluble triethylamine hydrochloride and evaporation of the solvent, long-chain alkyl chain dimers are obtained in yields of more than 90%. Synthese von C18-AKD aus Stearoylchlorid The use of other solvents, such as carboxylic acid esters or ketones for easier separation of trialkylamine hydrochlorides or other amines, such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-hexane-1,6-diamine does not provide any significant advantages. Also processes without the solvent use are described, in which the resulting amine hydrochloride is either filtered off or extracted with diluted aqueous acids. A continuous process in which long-chain carboxylic acid chloride and tertiary amine (e. g. dimethyl isopropylamine, dimethylcyclohexylamine or triethylamine) is supplied separately without solvents to a tube reactor, kneader or preferably a twin-screw extruder or planetary roller extruder and reacted at temperatures between 90 and 110 ¬∞C, delivers lactone contents of over 90% at short reaction times. Processing is carried out by phase separation or acidic extraction.  Use   Alkylated ketene dimers as paper sizing agents  The problems with the acidic (aluminum sulfate-mediated) mass sizing of paper with alkaline-digested colophony resins introduced since the early 19th century led besides the use of alkaline flocculants (such as chalk or calcium carbonate as the alkali reserve) to the search for alternative materials for sizing in a neutral or alkaline environment. In addition to the significantly more reactive alkenylsuccinic anhydrides (which do also hydrolyze rapidly in the presence of water) alkylated ketene dimers have begun to be preferred surface and mass sizes in the paper industry from the 1960s onwards, beginning in the 1950s. Strukturformel von C18-Alkenylbernsteins√§ureanhydrid (ASA) Industrially applied AKDs are derived from fatty acids with chain lengths between C14 (myristic acid) to C22 (behenic acid); palmityl (C16) diketene and stearyl (C18) ketene and mixtures thereof are preferably used, as well as fatty acid mixtures from the hydrolysis of animal and vegetable fats. Because of the chain length of the original fatty acids, AKD are waxy solids with melting points between 42 and about 70 ¬∞C. Mixtures of alkylated ketene dimers and water are dispersions at temperatures below 40 ¬∞C or emulsions at temperatures above 45 ¬∞C. Liquid AKD are not widely used, they are based on unsaturated fatty acids like oleic acid or branched fatty acids, like isostearic acid. Aqueous alkyldiketene dispersions generally contain 10-20 wt% of AKD, as well as active protective colloids (particularly polycations such as cationic starch, copolymers of N-vinylpyrrolidone and quaternized N-vinylimidazole, acylated polyethyleneimines or cationic high molecular weight polyacrylamides with an average molar mass up to 7 million g/mol) and other stabilizers (usually anionic surfactants, for example ligninsulfonates or condensation products of naphthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt and formaldehyde). Such stabilized AKD dispersions are active and stable at room temperature for up to three months and also tolerate the addition of different fillers for paper or cardboard (e.g. kaolin, chalk, talc, titanium dioxide, calcium sulfate, aluminum oxide, etc.) from 5 to 25%. The amounts of alkyl ketene dimers used for the sizing of paper and paper products are preferably in the range from 0.15 to 0.8 wt%, sometimes from 0.05 to 0.2 wt%, based on the dry paper stock. Paper sizing with alkylated ketene dimers For paper sizing with AKD, a three-step process was proposed which, despite controversial discussions in the 1990s, seems to describe the processes that are taking place best and explains the results achieved. Decisive criteria for the quality of the hydrophobicity of papers are # the retention of the AKD particles on the wet paper mass on the paper screen # the spreading of the AKD particles on the surface and the penetration in the paper mass # the chemical reaction of the hydroxyl groups of the cellulose (esterification) with the alkylated ketene dimers to form beta-ketocarboxylic esters. Reaktion von Alkylketendimeren (AKD) mit Cellulose The molecular structure (i.e. molar mass and cross-linking degree), the molar charge density of cationic groups, the exact dosage of the cationic polymer as a dispersion stabilizer and retention aid as well as keeping the other process parameters such as temperature, pH and residence times is crucial. After removal of excess water - also to avoid hydrolysis of the AKD to the beta-keto acid and subsequent decarboxylation to the ketone - Hydrolyse von Alkylketendimeren zu beta-Ketos√§uren und Decarboxylierung zum Keton follows the cracking of the stabilized AKD particles on the base paper mass, the melting of the solid AKD wax (at approx. 90 ¬∞C), the spreading of the liquid AKD wax by surface diffusion on the cellulose fibers and the formation of closed hydrophobic layers. The thickness of the hydrophobic layers depends on the AKD concentration in the dispersion. Ad 3. The hydrophobation of cellulose fibers with alkylated ketene dimers takes place most effectively in neutral or preferably weakly alkaline media (pH 7.5-9.0). The reaction temperature is generally 90-110 ¬∞C, with approximately 40% of the AKD used reacting with the cellulose. After the reaction contact angles of >100¬∞ are measured, indicating the hydrophobic character of the AKD-modified model surfaces. The esterification of hydroxyl groups of cellulose fibers was also demonstrated by comparison reactions with 14C-labeled AKD. The sizing with AKD is suitable for the permanent hydrophobation of newspaper, printing and writing paper and cardboard used as a container for liquids (including foodstuffs such as milk), as well as for the improvement of shape stability and runnability.

The monument is located in the neighborhood of Urca, near where the first settlement of the city of Rio de Janeiro was made. Attractions include the \\"Bondinho\\" cable car ride, inaugurated in 1912, Cl√°udio Coutinho Track for running or walking, the Morro da Urca trail with views of Corcovado, Copacabana, Botafogo and Guanabara Bay, and many rock climbing routes. Geology The two peaks are typical outcrops of augen gneiss, the same gneiss that forms the steep rock walls of the city. Kinzigite gneiss, less resistant to weathering, is present in the depression between Urca Hill and Sugar Loaf. The augen gneiss represents a deformed and recrystallized porphyritic granite that intruded into the kinzigite. These metasedimentary rocks are Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic in age. These Coastal Massifs form the eastern portion of Guanabara Bay. History The city of Rio de Janeiro was founded near to the Sugarloaf Mountain, then an island, on 1 March 1565. The site was chosen to guard the entrance to Guanabara Bay, and the mountain was important as a signalling point. A landfill connected the island to the mainland in 1697, and various buildings were erected to defend the territory, but the Urca urban neighborhood was only built 300 years after the city was founded. The Sugarloaf Mountain and Urca Hill Natural Monument was created by the city of Rio de Janeiro by municipal decree 26578 of 1 June 2006. The objectives are to guarantee green spaces for leisure in a natural area, and to conserve, protect and recover the existing Atlantic Forest ecosystem and landscape. The consultative council is chaired by the Municipal Environmental Secretariat, which administers the monument. The natural monument is part of the Carioca Mosaic, created in 2011.

Description  Perennial, dioecious climber. The plants produce a woody hypocotyl tuber and herbaceous, up to 5 m long shoots. The shoots are glabrous and have a waxy bluish green cover. Leaves are alternate usually sessile. Only the first leaves leaves of the shoots and in rare cases on mature shoots, short petioles can be observed. The lamina is 1.5‚Äì12.5 √ó 2.2‚Äì13.5 cm, usually profoundly 5-lobate, more or less amplexicaulous. Upper lamina glabrous with clear to whitish pustules. Lower lamina paler than upper lamina, glabrous, often with small dark glands along the main nerves. Tendrils are simple, very rarely unequally bifid. Probracts up to 1.7 mm long but usually missing. Flowers in each sex usually solitary, sometimes male flowers are in few- flowered racemes. Receptacle pale green, glabrous. Calyx teeth 1.5‚Äì3.5 mm long, lanceolate to (narrow) triangulate, erect to reflexed. Corolla 1.5‚Äì3 cm long, whitish cream to pale yellow, rarely dull orange-brown with conspicuous green venation, lobes 0.9‚Äì2 cm. Stamens 3, reduced to staminodia in female flowers. Anthers in male flowers sinuate, in a globose head. Ovary cylindrical, glabrous. Style in male flowers missing, in female flowers columnar, greenish yellow. Stigmas bulging, greenish yellow.

Seeds 6‚Äì8 √ó 3‚Äì3.5 √ó 1‚Äì1.5 mm, more or less symmetrically obovate, face flat. Male and female plants have (2n=) 24 equally sized chromosomes .  Distribution  Coccinia sessilifolia occurs in South Africa (Gauteng, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, and western Northern Cape), Namibia (Erongo, Khomas, Oshana, Otjozondjupa), and Botswana (Central District. Kgatleng, North-West District, South-East District).  Ecology  Semi-arid open habitats, except for Cape region and high mountains. Flowering January‚ÄìMay, October‚ÄìDecember.  Systematics and evolution  According to molecular DNA analyses, Coccinia sessilifolia is related to other South African species, such as Coccinia hirtella, Coccinia mackenii, and Coccinia quinqueloba. Some populations from the western part of Limpopo province have long petioles, but share all other characters with Coccinia sessilifolia. These were described as a distinct species: Coccinia variifolia A.Meeuse. Due to the strong similarities and the close relationship in the molecular phylogeny, Holstein (2015) interpreted that these populations are better dealt with as a variety of C. sessilifolia. Since long petioles are the dominant character state in all closer relatives, Coccinia sessilifolia var. variifolia can either be interpreted as a relict of long-petiolate ancestors or a secondary development of an ancestral character.

From about 1966 it was systematically cross- bred with imported Holstein stock. It became effectively extinct with the death of the last pure-bred bull in 1973, and was absorbed into the Swiss Holstein.  History  The Fribourgeoise was a traditional Swiss breed of cattle from the Canton of Fribourg in western Switzerland. A Fribourgeois bull took first prize at the second Concours agricole universel in Paris in 1856. A breeders' society was formed in 1890, and a herd-book was started in 1898 or 1899. In 1903 a bull named Garibaldi was sent to be exhibited in Milan, but was refused entry because it was named for the hero of the Unification of Italy; only after the name had been changed was it allowed to enter the country. In the 1940s the Fribourgeoise was distributed mainly in the canton of Fribourg, with some in the cantons of Neuch√¢tel and B√¢le. In the 1950s two bulls of the German Schwarzbunte Niederungsrind breed were imported, and in the 1960s there was some illegal importation of stock from both France and Germany. The name of the breed was changed to Schwarzfleckvieh. In 1966 the restrictive regulations on artificial insemination were lifted, and frozen Holstein semen from Canada began to be imported in quantity. In 1973, some doses were used. In the same year, the last remaining pure-bred Fribourgeois bull died, and the breed became effectively extinct. The modern Swiss Holstein is considered to be partly descended from it; it may also have influenced the development of the Italian Valdostana Pezzata Nera breed.  Characteristics and use  The Fribourgeoise was a large black-pied breed of dual-purpose cattle, kept for both milk and meat.

While no international frequency allocations exist for amateur radio in the sub- millimeter region, a number of administrations permit radio amateurs to experiment on Terahertz frequencies. Amateurs who operate in the region must design and construct their own equipment, and those who do, often attempt to set communication distance records on sub-millimeter frequencies. ITU Radio Regulations In the ITU Table of Frequency Allocations, no formal allocation to any radio service is present above 275 GHz, although the regulations themselves cover up to 3000 GHz (3 THz). However, a number of administrations permit amateur radio experimentation within the 275‚Äì3,000 GHz range on a national basis, under license conditions that are usually based on RR5.565. In ITU Radio Regulations, the range 275 ‚Äì 3000 GHz whilst not formally allocated, is subject to footnote 5.565; this was last revised by WRC-12 and the current version is below: 5.565 The following frequency bands in the range 275-1 000 GHz are identified for use by administrations for passive service applications: * Radio astronomy service: 275‚Äì323 GHz, 327‚Äì371 GHz, 388‚Äì424 GHz, 426‚Äì442 GHz, 453‚Äì510 GHz, 623‚Äì711 GHz, 795‚Äì909 GHz and 926‚Äì945 GHz; * Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) and space research service (passive): 275‚Äì286 GHz, 296‚Äì306 GHz, 313‚Äì356 GHz, 361‚Äì365 GHz, 369‚Äì392 GHz, 397‚Äì399 GHz, 409‚Äì411 GHz, 416‚Äì434 GHz, 439‚Äì467 GHz, 477‚Äì502 GHz, 523‚Äì527 GHz, 538‚Äì581 GHz, 611‚Äì630 GHz, 634‚Äì654 GHz, 657‚Äì692 GHz, 713‚Äì718 GHz, 729‚Äì733 GHz, 750‚Äì754 GHz, 771‚Äì776 GHz, 823‚Äì846 GHz, 850‚Äì854 GHz, 857‚Äì862 GHz, 866‚Äì882 GHz, 905‚Äì928 GHz, 951‚Äì956 GHz, 968‚Äì973 GHz and 985‚Äì990 GHz. The use of the range 275‚Äì1000 GHz by the passive services does not preclude use of this range by active services. Administrations wishing to make frequencies in the 275‚Äì1000 GHz range available for active service applications are urged to take all practicable steps to protect these passive services from harmful interference until the date when the Table of Frequency Allocations is established in the above-mentioned 275‚Äì1000 GHz frequency range. All frequencies in the range 1000‚Äì3000 GHz may be used by both active and passive services (WRC-12)  Germany  The current frequency plan German Amateur Radio Frequencies for German amateurs includes that frequency ranges 444 ‚Äì 453 GHz, 510 ‚Äì 546 GHz, 711 ‚Äì 730 GHz, 909 ‚Äì 926 GHz, 945 ‚Äì 951 GHz and frequencies above 956 GHz can be used by the amateur radio service.  United Kingdom  In October 2016, the UK regulator Ofcom made available a licence variation available to Full licensees for a series of bands within the 275‚Äì3000 GHz range. Applications for this can be obtained online via the RSGB website,RSGB Terahertz Guidance and Licence Application which also provides guidance on its use and the 20 km protective radii around UK radio telescope sites.  United States  FCC rule FCC Part 97 Rules ¬ß97.301 permits amateurs use of frequencies above 275 GHz, subject to rule ¬ß97.303 Clause-f which requires:- Not causing harmful interference to radio astronomy stations: 275‚Äì323 GHz, 327‚Äì371 GHz, 388‚Äì424 GHz, 426‚Äì442 GHz, 453‚Äì510 GHz, 623‚Äì711 GHz, 795‚Äì909 GHz, or 926‚Äì945 GHz.

Distance records  Due to the very high atmospheric absorption at submillimeter frequencies, it is difficult to establish communications over appreciable distances; however, a few radio amateurs have set distance records in the submillimeter range. The first recognized distance record was set by German stations DB6NT and DL1JIN on January 6, 1998. They achieved a distance of on 411 GHz, using SSB voice transmissions. On March 4, 2003, US stations WA1ZMS and W4WWQ set a new distance record of on 322 GHz, using wide-band frequency modulation. WA1ZMS and W4WWQ later set another record of on 403 GHz using CW (Morse code) on December 21, 2004. In Australia, a distance record on 324 GHz of was set by stations VK3KH and VK3XPD on August 21, 2011.

In the top ten, \\"Warriors\\" is number six, and \\"Indians\\" is number eight. The typical logo is an image of a stereotypical Native American man in profile, wearing a Plains Indians headdress; some are more realistic, while others are cartoons or caricatures. Other imagery include dreamcatchers, feathers, spears, and arrows. Individual schools may have performance traditions, such as the tomahawk chop, a mascot or cheerleaders in stereotypical Native attire, and chants adapted from Hollywood movies. These fictional representations stand in the way of any authentic understanding of contemporary Indigenous peoples, and promote racism. The documents most often cited to justifying the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintain harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present. The trend towards the elimination of indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady, with two-thirds having been eliminated during the 50 years prior to 2013 according to the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI). In more recent years, the trend has accelerated, particularly in July 2020, following a wave of racial awareness and reforms in wake of national protests after the killing of George Floyd, and the decision by the Washington Football Team to change their Redskins name and logo. In a few states with significant Native American populations, change has been mandated by law, such in Wisconsin, Oregon, and Washington. A bill to ban Native American mascots statewide passed the Maine House of Representatives and Senate and was signed into law by Governor Janet Mills in May, 2019. The list below for secondary schools in the United States and Canada remains substantial, with over 400 teams currently calling themselves \\"Indians\\", over 100 \\"Braves\\", over 100 \\"Warriors\\" using indigenous imagery (there are many with the name using generic, Greek or Roman mascots), and 44 \\"Redskins\\". The latter has shown the greatest decline, due to an association with the Washington Redskins name controversy.

In October, \\"Red Hawks\\" was chosen initially as the new mascot by the Board of Education. However, the name change became an issue in the 2019 municipal elections, leading to record turnout and Republican victories.

The partner was bought out during the first few years of the business.Bertman Ballpark Mustard - Official Site - About Us Bertman expanded his sales territory from Cleveland to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After WWII he had negotiated exclusive distribution rights to many food products with a fleet of trucks and a large sales force. The company moved to 653 E. 103rd by the mid-1930s, and changed its name to Bertman Pickle Co.. Not too shortly after that, the company moved again, this time to 2180 E. 76th. The company changed its name to Bertman Foods Company, which is now located at 7777 Grand Avenue in Cleveland. The company sold pickles, salad dressings, spices, coffees, teas, and canned and dried foods products to schools, hospitals, and other large-scale food operations. His company supplied mustard to League Park (then the home of the Cleveland Indians) and the Cleveland Municipal Stadium. Known for coming up with products to meet the needs of his clients, Bertman invented his spicy brown mustard in 1921.http://clevelandhistorical.org/items/show/271#.V44_JpMrKAz His mustard, under the family label, is served at major sports venues in Cleveland to this day. The mustard branded by one of his former employees, Stadium Authentic Mustard, is sold in retail stores, supermarkets, and online, and served in over 150 stadiums and arenas throughout the United States, but not in most Cleveland sports stadiums, where the competing Bertman's Original brand continues to be sold. Bertman befriended and mentored many well-known names in the food business. It is said that he introduced Chef Boy-ar-dee creator Hector Boyardee to Vernon Stouffer. Lewis J.

He is best known as a solo recording and touring artist in addition to his lead guitar playing for the New York post-punk rock band Certain General. Early years and influences Growing up in Texas, Gammage was exposed to local music styles such as blues, country, and rock. Moving to Boulder, Colorado as a teenager to attend college, he began to play guitar with local bands. Upon college graduation, he moved to San Francisco with his band The Corvairs and for several months played at rock clubs such as Mabuhay Gardens, The Palms, and The Deaf Club. Career New York and Certain General Gammage moved to New York City in the early 1980s, and formed post- punk rock band Certain General with singer Parker Dulany and B-Girls drummer Marcy Saddy. The group soon gained a large following on the East Coast and later toured Europe, enjoying considerable success. Gammage played lead guitar, harmonica, and co-wrote many of the songs on the band's best selling album November‚Äôs Heat (1984). The record won many accolades in Europe including \\"French rock album of the year 1985\\" from the Parisian newspaper Lib√©ration. Gammage has continued to tour and record with Certain General on a sporadic basis up to the present. He performed with the band at the 2013 and 2014 CBGB Festivals in New York City, and also toured Europe with the group in 2016. Solo career Following their 1985 American tour as opening act for New Order, Gammage left Certain General to focus on his other music projects. He released his first solo album Night Train in 1990 on the French independent label New Rose Records. Kneel to the Rising Sun (1991) soon followed and Gammage made a promotional visit to France in 1991,Phil Gammage interview on Radio Ici & Maintenant, Paris 1991. in support of the albums. Two more solo albums followed later in the decade, Cry of the City (1994, Marilyn/Alive Records) and Lowlife Street (1999, Last Call). Trouser Press said about his debut album Night Train, \\"Under wrought darkish Americana echoing Nick Cave's fascinations minus the melodrama‚Ä¶ might well make Phil this generation‚Äôs Hank Williams.\\" Trouser Press Record Guide, 1985. Gammage made his first ever solo tour of Europe in 2017. Songwriting and recent albums After concentrating on television and film instrumental soundtrack work for several years, Gammage returned to recording with the release of four studio albums Adventures in Bluesland (2014), The American Dream (2015), Used Man For Sale (2016), and It's All Real Good (2019). These albums spotlight his original material as well as his renditions of classic blues and country songs. Gammage's singing style on these albums is often compared to American male vocalists such as Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, and Scott Walker (singer). Rock NYC Live and Recorded wrote about Adventures in Bluesland > I am discussing Phil Gammage‚Äôs sweeping modern blues and rock album, which > owes so much to everyone one from Presley to Lead Belly, but sounds not > quite like any of them‚Ä¶ it is really about Phil‚Äôs wonderful singing; the man > seems to have stepped out of 1957 and yet not.

It is a part of the Xeno meta series created by Tetsuya Takahashi, but was formed after Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft. The series began with the original Xenoblade Chronicles game, published for the Nintendo Wii in 2010; it was a critical success and spawned sequels. The series has been both commercially and critically successful. Xenoblade Chronicles was well-received for its world design, music, and stories. The series has been represented in other gaming franchises, including the Super Smash Bros. and Project X Zone series.  Common elements   Gameplay  The gameplay within the Xenoblade Chronicles series uses a real-time action-based battle system, where the player manually moves a character in real-time, and party members will \\"auto- attack\\" when enemies enter their attack radius. Manually input attacks, called \\"Arts\\", may also be performed, but in a limited fashion. Battle Arts are only available after a \\"cool down\\" period that occurs after every use, while character specific \\"Talent Arts\\" only become available after enough auto- attacks are executed. Both party members and enemies have a finite amount of health points, and attacks deplete this value. Combat is won when all enemies lose their HP, but the game is lost if the player's character loses all their HP and has no means of being revived. Health may be restored by the player by using healing Arts in battle, or the player may let characters' HP regenerate automatically outside of battle. Winning battles earns the player experience points, which allows the characters to grow stronger by leveling up and learning new Arts. Arts for each character must be set by the player on their respective set up, called a \\"Battle Palette\\", outside of battles. Exploring large environments is a defining aspect of the series.  Setting  While the Xenoblade games do not share any setting directly, its universes are directly linked, except for the case of Xenoblade Chronicles X which is regarded as a spiritual successor. Two colossal titans known as the Bionis and the Mechonis serve as the setting for Xenoblade Chronicles; while only the Bionis's shoulder in the case of its epilogue titled Future Connected. Xenoblade Chronicles X takes place on an alien planet known as Mira. In Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and its prequel Torna - The Golden Country, the world of Alrest contains several titans which house many different nations. = Fictional chronology = In the series's fictional chronology, Xenoblade Chronicles is the first game to take place. Its epilogue, Xenoblade Chronicles: Future Connected is set one year after the events of the first game. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 takes place in a parallel universe, occurring simultaneously to the events of Xenoblade Chronicles. Its prequel, Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country is set 500 years before the events of the game. Shortly following the announcement of Xenoblade Chronicles X, the developers confirmed that it is not a direct sequel to the first game and is instead considered a spiritual successor, sharing many of philosophical concepts as its predecessor.  Characters  A race of small furry creatures known as the Nopon have appeared in every title in the series. In contrast to their appearances, the Nopon race, in general, tend to be greedy and selfish by nature. In every game, the names of Nopon non-player characters have been carried over to the next installment as the main Nopon character: Satata (Tatsu in Japan) from Xenoblade Chronicles appears in Xenoblade Chronicles X. Coincidentally, the Xenoblade Chronicles X incarnation of Tatsu has a major rival known as Tora, who also appears in Xenoblade Chronicles 2 as a playable Nopon character. Much like the \\"Van-\\" characters of the series, the Nopon characters do not share any similarities other than their names.  Games  There are three main games under the Xenoblade Chronicles series. Each game depicts a single episode within the flow of a larger time and space. Despite the loose connections between each entry, they each feature their own cast of characters, setting, and story. ;Xenoblade Chronicles: Shulk and his friends embark on a quest to get revenge against the Mechon for the assault on their home. As they journey along the backs of the titans, they unravel the secrets of a powerful weapon known as the Monado. It was originally released on the Wii and later ported to the New Nintendo 3DS as Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, and remastered as Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition on the Nintendo Switch. ;Xenoblade Chronicles X: An interstellar war forces humanity to flee a destroyed Earth. After crashing on the uncharted planet Mira, Elma and her team race against time to retrieve the Lifehold, a structure that contains thousands of lives. It was released on the Nintendo Wii U. ;Xenoblade Chronicles 2: In a world of dying titans, Rex meets the living weapon Pyra and promises to bring her to the fabled paradise Elysium. It was released on the Nintendo Switch. ;Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna - The Golden Country: Set 500 years before the events of Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Lora and Jin fight against Malos and his army before the inevitable fall of their kingdom, Torna. It was released on the Nintendo Switch as both a standalone game and as an expansion for Xenoblade Chronicles 2. ;Xenoblade Chronicles: Future Connected: Set one year after the events of the main story in the original Xenoblade Chronicles. Taking place on the Bionis' Shoulder, an area not explored in the original game, Future Connected follows Melia, Shulk, and Riki's daughter Nene and adopted son Kino as they seek to reclaim the city of Alcamoth. It was released on the Nintendo Switch as part of the remaster Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition. Future  In May 2018, series creator Tetsuya Takahashi pitched a new game concept to Nintendo. The first production group, known for their work on the ‚Äò‚ÄôXenoblade Chronicles‚Äô‚Äô series, started development on a new project in August 2018 after Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ‚Äì The Golden Country went gold. In October 2018, the 1st production division of Monolith Soft, led by Tetsuya Takahashi, started hiring for a new role-playing game project in the style of previous Xenoblade Chronicles titles. As of 2020, the Production Group is currently focused on strengthening the Xenoblade Chronicles brand for the foreseeable future, leaving no room for a smaller-scale game outside of the series. Takahashi said that while a continuation to Xenoblade Chronicles X is possible, the next game may go in a different direction as he often gets bored with the last project. In addition to pursuing a new direction for the series, series director Koh Kojima expressed an interest in making Xenoblade Chronicles 3 and Xenoblade Chronicles X2.  Development   Origin  The staff at Monolith Soft was left in a state of low morale after the commercial failure of the Xenosaga series which ultimately led to its premature end. In July 2006, Tetsuya Takahashi was struck by the idea of people living on top of enormous titans, so he wrote the concept down and turned it into a 3D model. The project was initially called Monado: Beginning of the World, but was changed to Xenoblade in Japan to honor Tetsuya Takahashi's previous work on the Xeno series and for his hard work on the game. Nintendo of Europe announced that they were publishing the game, adding Chronicles to Xenoblade. Due to no plans to release the title in North America, the fans launched a fan-campaign known as Operation Rainfall to convince Nintendo to bring Xenoblade Chronicles to North America along with The Last Story and Pandora's Tower. After months of silence, Nintendo of America confirmed that the title was headed for North America in April 2012. Monolith Soft began development of Xenoblade Chronicles, an action role-playing game for the Nintendo Wii that was released in Japan on June 10, 2010. The game was later localized by Nintendo of Europe and was released in Europe and Australia on August 19, 2011 and September 1, 2011 respectively. It was then brought over to North America as a GameStop exclusive on April 6, 2012. Some time after its initial reveal as Monado: The Beginning of the World, then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata changed the title to Xenoblade to honor Tetsuya Takahashi's previous work on the Xeno series. Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, a port handled by Monster Games, was released worldwide in April 2015 for the New Nintendo 3DS.  In other media  The Xenoblade Chronicles series has been represented in different mediums. Shulk has appeared as a playable fighter in Super Smash Bros. 4 and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In addition to Shulk, Dunban from the original Xenoblade Chronicles as well as Rex and Nia from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 appear as Mii Fighter costumes in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A Shulk amiibo figure was released in February 2015. The amiibo figure has allowed Shulk to appear as a costume in Yoshi's Woolly World and Super Mario Maker. Fiora from the original Xenoblade Chronicles appears as a playable character in Project X Zone 2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild features the outfit worn by Rex from Xenoblade Chronicles 2. Good Smile Company has released a figure of Pyra and Mythra from Xenoblade Chronicles 2. The company plans to release a figma of Xenoblade Chronicles 2's version of KOS-MOS and Melia from the epilogue story of Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition.  Reception  Xenoblade Chronicles sold nearly 200,000 units in Japan by the end of 2013. In a later interview, the game sold better in the west than it did in Japan. As of December 2015, Xenoblade Chronicles X sold roughly 377,000 units between Japan, France, and the United States. Xenoblade Chronicles 2 sold 1.42 million copies as of June 2018, which became the best-selling title ever developed by Monolith Soft. Its sales performance exceeded the company's expectations in western territories. Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna ‚Äì The Golden Country was also noted for surpassing their sales expectations in Japan as well.

Gameplay  The game is set on a moving train as two children ‚Äî Scarlet and Finn ‚Äî learn to navigate their relationship with each other, until their paths cross with a mysterious figure. According to the game reviews of Polygon and PlayStation Blog, the main themes of the game's story include the transition from childhood to adulthood and loss, shrouded in surrealism. Through a series of creative and contextual puzzles, players unlock key details about Finn and Scarlett's past and uncover the mystery behind the train journey. Plot Scarlett wakes up to find herself on a train. She searches for her brother Finn on the train in a game of Simon says. Afterward, an unnamed person wearing a rabbit mask appears and a panicked Finn tells Scarlett to wake up, making her awaken on the train once more. Unmoving figures who are all wearing animal masks begin to appear. Matching dialogue in the correct order with the masked persons creates vague contexts for the story and allows Scarlett to move onto the next area. Scarlett begins to be unsure of her surroundings, as areas such as her grandpa's greenhouse and her treehouse shared with her brother begin to materialize and branch out of areas of the train. Throughout her journey, she develops the ability to \\"give life\\" to objects and control fire while also encountering a dark substance called Umbra, which seems to hate light. After a few puzzles, Finn will become angry at Scarlett, saying that Scarlett left him and that Scarlett should never have left him alone. Scarlett can either choose to transfer fire out of their treehouse or transfer fire into their treehouse, creating a sense of catharsis or a sense of redemption in the dialogue between Finn and Scarlett that end with Finn and Scarlett forgiving each other for prior grievances. Scarlett then wakes up once more but on the shore by a body of water with Finn and a makeshift raft. Finn asks Scarlett to fix up 'Finnland' by finding objects to spruce up the place. After fixing Finnland, the rabbit masked figure appears and leads Scarlett through a tunnel that takes her back to the treehouse and then the train, and then returning to Finnland. After dialogue with the masked figures while dealing with the Umbra, Scarlett realizes that Finn died in an accident when Scarlett was out on a date (implying that she was interacting with Finn's spirit this entire time). This takes Scarlett and Finn back to the treehouse and leads Finn to say he doesn't want to go alone because he does not remember what their parents, who died long ago, look like. Scarlett draws a picture of what their mom looks like and attaches it onto one of the figures, who transforms into their mom after Scarlett uses magic. Scarlett says her goodbyes and Finn and their parents walk away into the moonlight of the treehouse deck, fading away in the form of luminescent butterflies. Scarlett then wakes up back on the train, which had just arrived at a station (which implies that her entire journey was just a dream). The story ends with Scarlett noticing an animal mask nearby, which is the same mask worn by the mother figure.  Development  The game was the first console/PC game developed by indie studio PaperSeven who spent 20 months developing it. The game was announced via trailer in June 2016. The small team had previously worked together on racing games, such as Split Second and Pure, and outside the genre, on The Room and at Disney.  Reception  Polygon recommended the game for players who appreciated narrative-driven games, such as Gone Home, Dear Esther, and Firewatch. The reviewer goes on to praise Finn's portrayal, stating \\"I can't recall such a good portrayal of a child in a game, since the Studio Ghibli-produced Ni No Kuni\\". It was among the website staff's most anticipated games of 2017, and was ranked 25th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017.

It results from systematic cross-breeding, through artificial insemination between 1966 and 1973, of the traditional dual-purpose black-pied Fribourgeoise from the Canton of Fribourg in western Switzerland with Canadian Holstein stock.  History  The Fribourgeoise, later known as the Schwarzfleckvieh, was a traditional Swiss breed of cattle from the Canton of Fribourg in western Switzerland. In 1966, restrictive regulations on artificial insemination were lifted, and frozen semen from Canadian Holstein bulls began to be imported in quantity. In 1973, some doses were used. In the same year, the last remaining pure-bred Fribourgeois bull died, and the breed became effectively extinct. The modern Swiss Holstein is considered to derive from it. The breed has spread throughout Switzerland, and constitutes approximately 13% of the national dairy herd. In 2011 there were about cows, with 459 bulls. In 2015 a population of was reported.  Characteristics  The Swiss Holstein is a large black-pied breed of dairy cattle. It produces large quantities of milk, but is less well-suited than the Braunvieh and Simmental to the extensive pasture management that is traditional in Switzerland.

Also referred to in the press as Consolidated National Bank, the institution was organized on July 1, 1902 with capital of $1 million. Wrote the New York Times, the bank was \\"founded with the idea of cornering the business of the Consolidated Exchange and its brokers.\\" The bank opened for business at 57 Broadway on September 22, 1902, and a year later the bank took out a five-year lease at the Exchange Court Building. In 1906, the Consolidated Stock Exchange withdrew its deposits with the Consolidated National Bank. In 1909, the bank voted to acquire the assets of Oriental Bank and merge them with Consolidated, creating the National Reserve Bank. The Consolidated name was operative for a short time afterwards. History 1902: Formation On February 11, 1902, The New York Times reported that around $600,000 had been subscribed to the capitalization of the Consolidated National Bank, with organization by founding president Mortimer H. Wagar. Wagar had been president of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange, or the Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York, from which he retired around 1902 to join the Consolidated National Bank. Also by February 11, 1902, a lease for portions of two floors in the Pinkerton Building at 57 Broadway had been arranged for the institution, with three months estimated until the start of the bank's opening. The Consolidated National Bank was organized on July 1, 1902. With fourteen members on the bank's board of directors, the officers were headquartered at 51 Broadway, with capital of $1 million. In late August 1902, the bank elected three new directors. On September 12, 1902, the New York Times reported that the organization of the Consolidated National Bank of New York had been completed with the filing of papers with the Controller of the Currency, with the first directors meeting held the subsequent week. The office was stated to be set for 37 Broadway in Manhattan. The bank opened at No. 57 Broadway on Monday, September 22, 1902, with capital of $1,000,000 and a surplus of $1,000,000.Among the banks The Banking Law Journal, volume 19, p. 664 Willis S. Paine was founding president. 1902-1905: Early profits On October 23, 1902, the bank received the first amount of the cash it ordered, equating to $20,000 in the form of new five-dollar bank notes with Benjamin Harrison. The remainder of the $250,000 in bank notes ordered by the bank was delivered in tens and twenty dollar bills. The New York Times reported it as a \\"new national banknote,\\" writing that \\"the back of the note is green and not brown, as is the case with the notes of most other banks.\\" At close of business day on November 25, 1902, the bank had profits of $1,012,995, and deposits of $2,607,946. It also had loans of 2,529,810. Total resources equated to $4,930,742. Then situated at 57 Broadway, in September 1903, the bank took out a five-year lease on around 2,500 square feet of ground floor at the Exchange Court Building, which was located at the corner of Broadway and Exchange Place. It was reported on April 16, 1904 that Consolidated National Bank, with Willis Paine still as president, would begin clearing through the Fourth National Bank. By November 16, 1904 Willis S. Paine served as president, with Mortimer H. Wagar as vice president. On January 8, 1905, the bank's president Willis S. Paine published a full-page op-ed in the New York Times arguing for frequent examinations of bank finances. The annual directors meeting was held in January 1905, with several directors resigning or voted out. Stock for the bank was originally issued at $200, and by September 20, 1905, was selling around $175, and had paid no dividends. President Paine, when asked about the bank's ability to make money, stated \\"none of the banks has been making money. With money at 2.5 per cent, or 3 per cent., there is no chance to make money. The trust companies perhaps have been making money recently, but the banks have not.\\" Willis S. Paine resigned the presidency of the Consolidated National Bank of New York City around November 1905, with announced plans to travel the world. 1905-1907: Change in leadership The day before November 1, 1905, the board elected O.F. Thomas as new president, replacing Willis S. Paine after Paine's resignation. At the time, the New York Times reported that the bank \\"has not been doing well in the matter of earnings, and Mr. Thomas, it was said had been brought into the bank's management in the belief that he would be instrumental in building up its business.\\" At the time, the bank's original organizer, M.H. Wagar, stated that the original business model of catering to Consolidated Exchange depositers had not worked well overall, and that, as reported by the TImes, \\"the institution from this time on was to be regarded as seeking a general business without any special reference to the interests of the Consolidated Exchange.\\" On February 9, 1906, the Consolidated Stock Exchange withdrew its deposits with the Consolidated National Bank and moved them to the National Bank of North America. Wrote the Times the next day, \\"the Consolidated National Bank was founded with the idea of cornering the business of the Consolidated Exchange and its brokers, but since the bank passed into Mr. E.R. THomas's control after another of the Exchange officers have withdrawn from its Directorate.\\" By July 1907, the bank's shares were selling on the open market for $180 each. E.R. Thomas sold his interest in the Consolidated National Bank in October 1907, also resigning from his positions. On December 14, 1907, the Times reported that Consolidated National Bank was in the works to acquire the National Bank of North America. The deal was vetoed on December 17, 1907 by National's president. According to the Times, the proposal had been \\"the purpose of the Consolidated National Bank's Directors to effect a reduction of the capital of their bank, which, with its surplus, is very much more than the present requirements of the business done, thereby returning to the stockholders a large amount of cash per share. This cash was to be used in acquiring stock in the National Bank of North America.\\" 1909: National Reserve Bank On February 2, 1909, Consolidated ratified a plan to acquire the Oriental Bank \\"by allowing its shareholders to subscribe to the shares of a new institution at $150 a share.\\" The Oriental Bank had closed the year prior, but had paid its depositors in full. The new institution, to be named the National Reserve Bank, combined aspects of both banks. A special meeting was called for February 18 for final ratification by stockholders. On February 18, 1909, the bank stockholders voted to enact the merger proposed by the directors, to take over the assets of Oriental Bank and merge them with Consolidated, creating the National Reserve Bank of the City of New York. The plan increased capital of the bank from $1,000,000 to $1,200,000. At the same meeting, 23 directors were elected to the new board, including E. A. Fisher and Mortimer H. Wagar. The bank planned to keep the Consolidated name operative until March 1, 1909. On March 2, 1909, Will-tarn O. Allison (W.O. Allison), president of Consolidated National Bank, was voted president of the new National Reserve Bank entity formed by Consolidated's absorption of Oriental Bank's assets. Thomas J. Lewis and R. W. Jones Jr. were elected vice presidents, and George W. Adams, cashier. With the merger of the reorganized Oriental Bank with the Consolidated National Bank of New York, capital was increased from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000. The National Reserve Bank of the City of New York formally opened its doors for business on March 8, 1909, at \\"the old banking quarters of the Oriental Bank\\" at 182 Broadway, corner of John Street in Manhattan, until new facilities at the City Investing Building could be completed at 165 Broadway. In late April 1909, the National Reserve Bank, formerly named Consolidated National Bank, opened for business in the City Investing Building. Directors When the Consolidated National Bank was organized on July 1, 1902, the fourteen directors included Jonathan B. Currey, Mortimer H. Wagar, George S. Hart, Willis S. Paine, R. A. Chesebrough, Chalence Whitman, Edward G. Burgess, Oscar L. Richard, O.D. Ashlay, George Crocker, John W. Griggs, J. Temple Gwathmey, Henry C. Brewster, and Perry Belmont. In late August 1902, the bank elected Amzi L. Barber, Lyman G. Bloomingdale of Bloomingdale Brothers, and James G. Newcomb as directors. The first directors meeting was held in late September 1902. On April 16, 1904, with Willis Paine still as president, four new directors were added. It was reported on April 16, 1904 that new directors were added to Consolidated including Alonzo Burbank, Thomas F. Manville, William T. Brown, and Charles H. Patterson. Early directors as of November 16, 1904 included Wagar, Chas H. Patterson, O.W. Richard. Willis S. Paine served as president, with Mortimer H. Wagar as vice president. John W. Griggs retired as a director around November 1905. On October 31, 1905, board vacancies were filled by E.R. Thomas, O.F. Thomas, Robert Maclay, and George B. Hays, all who were selected by E.R. Thomas. Four vacancies remained on the board, after the retirement of Willis S. Paine, O. M. Farrand, and J. W. Griggs.

Scharff (July 7, 1916 ‚Äì August 17, 2006) was a German-American arts patron, fashion designer and manufacturer and land developer. He was co- founder and chairman of Lanz Incorporated, a designer and manufacturer of dresses and nightgowns. The Lanz flannel granny nightgown became a staple of women's nightware in the late 1950s. As a large landowner, Scharff has been called a pioneer of Venice Beach in Los Angeles for contributing to the development and expansion of the city. His investments include the Cadillac Hotel, Beach House on Ocean Front Walk, L.A. Louver, and James Beach Cafe.  Early life  Scharff was born in Landau, Germany the youngest of three brothers. His father, a grocer, died when he Scharff was 10, forcing him to leave school and join the family's grocery business. By age 20, Scharff, with the family business failing, used his savings to move in 1937 with his brother Kurt to start a new business in New York, arriving as political refugees.  Career  Once in New York, Scharff and his brother partnered with Austrian retailer Sepp Lanz, an √©migr√©, in his Austrian-style clothes and sleepwear retail store. Scharff soon discovered there was a demand for the clothing line in the California region. In 1938, the Scharffs and Lanz relocated to Los Angeles to open a store location on Wilshire Boulevard, specializing in Austrian-inspired ski clothing and sleepwear. When American film actress Hedy Lamarr wore their clothes in the film Ziegfeld Girl, the company received film credits, which gave the Lanz line national attention. In 1946, the Scharff brothers bought the business from Lanz and focused on manufacturing. The same year, Scharff encouraged nearby clothing retailers to sell their line in their stores. At the same time, the company established a wholesale business with department stores worldwide.  Lanz flannel granny nightgown  In 1953, Scharff designed and unveiled a nightgown line, \\"the granny gown,\\" which was made of inexpensive cotton flannel and became Lanz Inc.‚Äôs signature product. It was based on a dress that Scharff's landlady had worn. By the late 1950s, the gown became a popular cover-up for women. As a result, the company expanded to 30 retail stores and establish a manufacturing division. Playwright Wendy Wasserstein was known to have worn a Lanz nightgown while writing.  Venice Beach  In the 1950s, Scharff began buying property in the Venice Beach area of southern California and rehabilitating them. During a lengthy downturn with businesses on the oceanfront, he helped design a master plan for the community that included storefronts. He became one of the largest property owners in Venice. Scharff also commissioned artwork, including building murals that include a Van Gogh tribute \\"Starry Night\\" at Wave Crest and Ocean Front Walk and a portrait of Venice founder Abbot Kinney that highlights a five-story brick apartment building Scharff once owned on Venice Boulevard.  Personal life  Scharff was married three times and was divorced twice. Also, the children whom Scharff had with his first wife, Eleanor Mace, were Peter Scharff and Alexis Scharff. The child whom Scharff had with his second wife, Alexandra Scharff is Christopher Scharff. He then married his third wife Simone Hormel Scharff, who had children from her previous marriage to Thomas Hormel, including Smokey (Gregory) Hormel, an extremely accomplished and renowned guitarist, Michele Hormel, Angela Hormel and Christopher Hormel.  Death  In the early 2000s, Scharff was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs disease. He died at his Santa Monica, California home on August 17, 2006, of complications from Parkinson‚Äôs.

They were made when O'Keeffe was teaching at West Texas State Normal College in Canyon, Texas. They reflect the evolution of her work towards pure abstraction, and an early American modernist landscape. It was unique for its time. Compared to Sunrise that she painted one year earlier, it was simpler and more abstract. Striving to design harmonious paintings that are an interpretation of her feelings about the subject, she created a work of the Texas plains and wide open skies‚Äîand particularly the sunrises found there‚Äî that were wondrous to her. It has been called a radical work of art, and Light Coming on the Plains III is considered one of the best paintings of the skies by Laura Cumming of The Guardian. Background She began a series of watercolor paintings based upon the scenery and expansive views during her walks, which often included Palo Duro Canyon. O'Keeffe enjoyed the Texas plains and particularly the sky, which she said she loved and found wonderful. She enjoyed sunrises, sunsets and moonrises‚Äîand developed a fondness for intense and nocturnal colors. During an early morning bus ride from Amarillo to Canyon, O‚ÄôKeefe said that she saw \\"the most extraordinary sunrise\\" that encouraged her to paint again. She moved out of her boarding house and chose to move into the home of the college physics professor and his wife because it was on the third floor and faced east, giving her a clear view of the dawning day. Building upon a practice she began in South Carolina in her charcoal abstractions, O'Keeffe painted to express her most private sensations and feelings. Rather than sketching out a design, she freely painted with watercolor. Overview O'Keeffe painted until she believed she truly captured her feelings in the watercolor, Light Coming on the Plains No. I. Due to its minimal form, it is an abstraction, yet still evocative of a sunrise. The early modernist painting, a unique type of landscape painting for the time, was a towards pure abstraction. Georgia O'Keeffe, Sunrise, watercolor, 1916 The painting is more subtle and evocative of a sunrise than her Sunrise painting of 1916. Rather than the depiction a brilliant sunrise, Light Coming on the Plains is evocative of the sun rising in the sky through ever deepening color washes of indigo blue. In the series, she reflects her ability to design with minimal form and to create harmony using tonal values, or Notan-composition, that she learned through Alon Bemet and Arthur Wesley Dow. The work evokes the philosophy of Henri Bergson, who found that the purpose of art is to create a communion between ourselves and nature. The first two paintings have a lighter orb, the third is darker, which reflects the \\"ebb and flow of light at dawn.\\" O‚ÄôKeeffe described her experience of a sunrise on the Texas plains, \\"The light would begin to appear, and then it would disappear and then there would be a kind of halo effect, and then it would appear again. The light would come and go for a while before it came.\\" Alfred Stieglitz arranged a retrospective of 100 of her paintings at Anderson Galleries in January 1923 that included Light Coming on the Plains No. II and III. Laura Cumming of The Guardian included it in her list of the top 10 paintings of the sky in 2012. She later compared it to O'Keeffe's signature motifs of erotic flowers and desert skulls, calling Light Coming on the Plains III \\"one of the purest and most radical images O‚ÄôKeeffe ever made\\". About the motivation and development of the work, Cumming states, \\"Daybreak over Texas, and Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe is out in the landscape, mesmerised by the vast skies above her. She paints everything her eyes can take in. The dawn becomes a luminous glow beneath the blue arches of her marvellous watercolour, a rising dome that hovers between the real and the abstract. The painting is small but it holds infinity.\\" References 1917 paintings Paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe Abstract art Watercolor paintings ","title":"Light Coming on the Plains"},{"id":"52882796","text":"Kaistia adipata is a bacterium from the genus of Kaistia which has been isolated from soil near the Chung-Ju industrial complex in Korea.

Life Pierre Michelin was the younger of his father's two recorded sons. He only became a director of the family company after 1932 following the death in a flying accident of his elder brother, √âtienne Michelin. He was sent to Citro√´n car company in 1935. Citroen had filed for bankruptcy in November 1934 when one of its creditors, a steering wheel supplier, applied to the court to enforce payment of a debt. As Citro√´n's supplier of tyres it was Michelin that was that company's largest creditor. In January 1935 Andr√© Citro√´n, already suffering from the cancer that would kill him a few months later, offered Michelin options to acquire a large block of voting shares in the business as additional security for the monies owed for tyres. With his father otherwise preoccupied, Pierre Michelin jumped at the opportunity, and by the end of January 1935 Michelin controlled more than 50% of the voting capital in Citroen. Pierre Michelin became president of Citro√´n in July 1935 when Andr√© Citro√´n died, but by that time he was already running the company, cutting back on wasteful management practices and applying the type of detailed control already in place at the main Michelin plant in Clermont-Ferrand. The immediate priority was the Citro√´n Traction Avant for which massive investment in production capacity had been necessary and which had been launched in April 1934 before all the gremlins in the design had been addressed in order to generate desperately needed revenue. Although the revolutionary unitary bodyshell was, according to most reports, not affected by the rushed launch schedule, problems with transmission joints and the hydraulic brakes ‚Äì another \\"first\\" in a volume car in Europe ‚Äì reflected the financial pressure to get the car into production as quickly as possible. Pierre Michelin's period at the head of the company saw the correction of early teething troubles on what became a successful and ultimately very profitable model for the company. The Citro√´n acquisition which Pierre Michelin led marked the beginning of a defining partnership for both companies that would last for more than forty years. In the political world there are persistent suspicions that Pierre Michelin had financial links with a cell of the neo-fascist Cagoule movement. France under the Popular Front government was undergoing a surge in nationalist extremism and industrial unrest at this time, but during the ensuing decades the suspicions involving Pierre Michelin never progressed beyond the status of rumor. Death On 29 December 1937, while driving his Citro√´n Traction near Montargis on the main road to the south, Pierre Michelin was involved in a fatal collision. The other car involved was a Peugeot, driven by Louis Lagorgette, the principal private secretary of the politician Paul Faure. Lagorgette, his wife and his son all died at the scene of the accident. Pierre Michelin died at the hospital in Montargis the next day, soon after undergoing an operation for the amputation of his right leg. Pierre- Jules Boulanger was left to run Citro√´n without his friend, something he accomplished with flair and success for the next thirteen years. A sad parallel came in 1950 when Boulanger himself died at Bro√ªt-Vernet, Allier, also in a car crash in a Citro√´n Traction Avant, on Sunday, 12 November 1950, while on the main road between Clermont-Ferrand (the home of Michelin) and Paris.\\"Crash Kills Boulanger, Citroen Motor President\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, November 13, 1950, p1 References People from Clermont-Ferrand 20th-century French businesspeople Road incident deaths in France 1903 births 1937 deaths ","title":"Pierre Michelin"},{"id":"52882812","text":"The MRTC 3000 class or ƒåKD Tatra RT8D5M LRV, also known as Tatra Train, is a class of high-floor light rail vehicles built by Czech tram manufacturer ƒåKD Tatra. It is currently used at Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3 and were the last made by ƒåKD Tatra before it was taken over by Siemens. ƒåKD Tatra RT8D5M LRVs are owned by Metro Rail Transit Corporation (MRTC), and operated by the Department of Transportation (DOTr) thru DOTr MRT-3.  Purchase  In line with the construction of the Manila Line 3 in the 1990s, ƒåKD Tatra was chosen by the Metro Rail Transit Corporation to supply the new trains after the consortium won the project. Aside from a prototype, 73 light rail cars are produced by ƒåKD in two batches; 49 were produced in 1998 and the other 29 were completed the following year. The first train was flown into Manila via plane while the remainder were transported by sea. The fleet also happens to be the last produced by ƒåKD before it was taken over by Siemens.  Design   Structure  The LRV design is a one-way eight-axle motorized car consisting of three articulations, which are connected to each other by the joint and the cover. Each rail car is provided with five double leaf, electronically- operated plug-sliding doors. The three center doors have an open width of 1,255 mm, while the two end doors measures at 861 mm. Unlike the prototype 0029, these cars have rounded \\"foreheads\\" or beveled large windows at both ends. The trains wear a livery consisting of royal blue, red, and white. Under the \\"Metrostar Express\\" branding, the white portion contains the brand logo and lettering on the sides. However, since 2012, the branding has since been unused. The trains also usually wore wrap ads‚Äîunlike the LRTA 1200 class which wear ads as a whole trainset, the 3000 class are seen to wear wrap ads per car.  Interior  Each train can seat 80 passengers and under crush loading conditions, each car can carry 394 commuters at any one time. Seats are longitudinal-type. Prototype RT8D5 0029 In March 1996 the first three-car tram was tested in Prague under the number 0029 as a prototype. It was a development of the Tatra KT8D5; 0029 retained its control, proportions, the front and rear sections, and unlike the later production vehicles, designed for bidirectional operation. Prototype 0029 remained in Prague and it was used in October to November 1998 together with the Tatra-T5A5 prototype, tram no. 0013, and the T3 no. 6663 for various crash tests in the main workshop in Hostiva≈ô before being eventually scrapped.  Operations  The trains run at a maximum speed of , and run through standard rail tracks. The RT8D5M operates as built on the high-speed city rail system with high platforms and in tropical conditions. The vehicles are mainly operated in threes, and operations with four-car trainsets had been planned. Refurbishments On May 1 2019, the overall rehabilitation of the entire MRTC 3000 class fleet of 72 cars was carried out by the Sumitomo Corporation, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and TES Philippines Inc. (TESP). The rehab project of the LRVs consists of the installation of new choppers, wheels, pantographs, air conditioning units from Thermo King; the repainting of the train's exteriors and interiors; and the fitting of new lighting installations throughout the trains, with the overall refurbishment program of the trains are expected to be completed on July 2021.

Formerly in the historic county of Dunbartonshire, it is formed on its eastern shore from the confluence of the Firth of Clyde with the Gare Loch, and of the Clyde with Loch Long to the west. Geography It is approximately long (as measured from the head of the Gare Loch) and across at its widest point. The 56th parallel north cuts through the southern end of the peninsula. Naming Although named after the small village of Rosneath on its eastern shore, the largest settlements are the contiguous villages of Kilcreggan and Cove at its southernmost tip. During the Victorian era it became a popular destination for wealthy Glasgow businessmen who built luxurious holiday homes along its shore. Rosneath Castle was for a time the residence of Princess Louise, Queen Victoria's daughter. As with many grand houses in the area, it has since been demolished. Settlements On the western shore of the peninsula the settlement of Coulport is home to a Royal Navy Armaments Depot, whilst on the eastern shore the hamlet of Rahane overlooks the HMNB Clyde base of the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons. Transport Access to the peninsula is either by road (the B833 which runs from Garelochhead to Coulport) or by ferry from Gourock to Kilcreggan, however the ferry is for foot passengers only. During the summer months PS Waverley calls at Kilcreggan pier. The B833 follows the shoreline but two roads cross the peninsula: both un-numbered, one for local traffic from Ardpeaton to Rahane, the other considerably larger and mainly designed for military traffic between Coulport and Faslane. More recently the area has become a popular destination for cyclists as it is possible to do a circular tour of the peninsula using the military road.

A number of controversies have arisen under his administration.  Plagiarism of inauguration speech  Nana Akufo-Addo was accused of lifting parts of his inauguration speech from previous addresses given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush. This led to a public uproar with some deeming it as an embarrassment to the country and calling for the sacking of the speechwriter or for someone to take responsibility. The Director of Communication at the Presidency subsequently issued an apology. Some public figures also called for Ghanaians to disregard the incident. Akufo-Addo has since referred to the incident in jest at a thanksgiving service he attended. Official Residence And Office for former president John Dramani Mahama Immediately after Nana Akufo-Addo was sworn in, a letter dated 19 December 2016 signed by Julius Debrah, former chief of staff, became public. It contained a message that former President John Dramani Mahama would want to keep Bungalow No 3 in Accra and its adjoining facilities as his retirement home and Bungalow No 6 in Accra as his office. There were also claims in the media that Mahama wanted to buy the house he currently resides in, which he rebutted with a statement dated Tuesday 10 January, and further withdrawing his request completely. Akufo-Addo commended Mahama for withdrawing his request to the residential and office accommodation. Bribery among parliamentary appointment committee members An NDC MP for Bawku Central and member of the appointment committee responsible for vetting ministerial appointees alleged that members of the minority on the committee were offered Gh¬¢ 30,000 ( US Dollars) to influence their judgement and facilitate the approval of energy minister designate Boakye Agyarko. Two minority MPs, Alhassan Suhiyini and Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa have publicly corroborated Ayariga's claim and jointly petitioned the speaker of parliament to probe the matter. Ablakwa further claimed that four other minority MPs, Sampson Ahi, Eric Opoku, Nii Lante Vanderpuye and Yiele Chireh, questioned the source of the money since it was not a part of their sitting allowance, and fearing it could be a bribe also promptly returned it. Ayariga's allegations also revealed that the money was handed out to the MPs by the minority chief whip Muntaka Mubarak as coming from chairman of the vetting committee Joe Osei Owusu in favour of the energy minister designate. As of 30 January 2017 all accused persons in the chain of giving the bribe have denied any involvement. Boycott of voting process for minister designate Otiko Afisa Djaba Opposition to the nomination of Otiko Afisa Djaba to become minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection by minority legislators led to the speaker of the house subjugating her approval to a secret balloting among members of the floor of parliament. The minority walked out of the voting process. Their major concern was that she refused to apologize to the ministerial appointment committee for referring to John Mahama in her capacity as national women's organizer of NPP during a political rally in 2016 at Asawase as \\"extremely wicked\\", \\"evil\\", \\"corrupt\\", \\"a failure\\" and \\"an embarrassment\\" to northerners, adding that \\"he is a violent person\\" with the \\"heart of a devil\\" and another tenure for John Mahama will result in \\"years of more corruption, unemployment and poverty\\". She maintains that her comments were non-provocative and that she does \\"not owe anybody an apology\\", continuing to insist on her use of the same language to describe the former president. Other concerns were that Afisa Djaba backed assertions that Electoral Commission chairperson Charlotte Osei was appointed to her position in exchange for sex. Issues were also raised about the failure of Afisa Djaba to do her one-year mandatory national service to the country in violation of The Ghana National Service Scheme Act 426 section 7 which states that \\"a person who has not commenced and completed his or her period of national service shall not; (b) be employed by any other person outside the Scheme\\". Otiko Afisa Djaba obtained 152 favorable votes in excess of the 50% required to secure her the position.  The proposed use of the Heritage Fund to implement the free SHS education policy  President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo- Addo says government would fund the cost of public senior high schools (SHS) for all those who qualify for entry from the 2017/2018 academic year onward. Questions as to how the ruling government would fund this policy have been raised. Policy Think Tank, IMANI Ghana has already questioned how the government will fund the policy. However, former Director-General of the Ghana Education Service, Charles Aheto-Tsegah said the government's decision to roll out the free Senior High School education policy this year is feasible but there must be some changes in the national budgetary expenditure. Senior minister, Minister Yaw Osafo Marfo, said the Heritage Fund which receives nine percent of the country's annual petroleum revenue will be used to sustain the program. Minority leader, Haruna Iddrisu disagreed saying government's decision to tap into reserved oil revenue (Heritage Fund) to finance its free senior high school (SHS) policy would be fatal for Ghana's future because it might compromise the safety of the country as it was set aside to serve as a buffer during challenging economic times. The President said, \\"By free SHS, we mean that in addition to tuition, which is already free, there will be no admission fees, no library fees, no science center fees, no computer laboratory fees, no examination fees, no utility fees. There will be free textbooks, free boarding and free meals and day students will get a meal at school for free. Free SHS will also cover agricultural, vocational and technical institutions at the high school level\\".  Elephant Sized Government  President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has made a total of 110 ministerial appointments as the team he wants to work with to run the affairs of Ghana. The number by far is the highest number of ministerial appointments made by any Ghanaian President. His appointment named three deputies for ministries like Finance, Information, Local Government and Rural Development as well as Energy. The Minority leader of the opposition National Democratic Congress, Haruna Iddrissu has indicated that the elephant sized government by the president will put pressure on the limited public purse, adding that the President has created a government equal to the size of his party symbol. Pressure group, Occupy Ghana has also hit hard at the government, arguing that the President will be promoting corruption with the large number of ministers he wants to work with and went on to question the commitment of the President to protect the public purse. Responding in the media about a large size government for a small country such as Ghana, then Minister for Information Mustapha Hamid jabbed at critics stating that \\"We never promised a lean government\\". The information minister further indicated that the only way to solve the huge problems created by the erstwhile administration and to fulfill their promises is by appointing an army of ministers.

BOST Contaminated Fuel Scandal  The Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation (BOST) was in the news to have sold 5 million litres of contaminated fuel to an unlicensed company Movepiina and Zup Oil which is alleged to have caused Ghana to lose 7 million Ghana Cedis in revenue. The Minister of Energy Mr. Boakye Agyarko came out to say the BNI has cleared BOST of any wrong doing which the Minority in Parliament believes its a cover up by the Government on in the contaminated fuel saga.  US$2.25 Billion Bond Saga  The Finance Minister of Ghana Mr Ofori-Atta's in April 2017 issued a US$2.25 Billion bond. The minority in Parliament, National Democratic Congress called for a probe into the bond for lack of transparency, a tendency of the bond affecting the welfare of Ghanaians and a possible conflict of interest involving the Finance Minister. The minority went on to petition the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and summoned the Finance Minister to Parliament. In responding to the claims by the minority, the finance Minister said the process in securing the bond was transparent and went on to defend the bond. The Council of State was accused of negotiating with the Minority to stop pursuing the bond saga, however the Council of State denied ever engaging with the minority on the bond saga.  Bloated Government with 110 ministers of state.  In 2017, the Akuffo Addo government swore in 110 ministers, the largest ever government in Ghana since the beginning of the fourth republic. Members of the minority in parliament as well as some government organisations raised some concerns about the size of the government.  Gh¬¢800k website Saga  In December 2017, the Ministry for Special Development and Initiatives (first of its kind formed by the Akuffo Addo Government) headed by Mavis Hawa Koomson budgeted to use Gh¬¢800,000.00 ( US Dollars) to build a new website. This generated a lot of backlash from the minority in parliament and also sparked a lot of controversy on social media which saw many Ghanaians joining the fray. Despite the uproar the budget was approved due to the ruling party's majority in parliament.  Kelni-GVG saga  The ministry of information on 27 December 2017 led by the minister Ursula Owusu Ekuful awarded Kelni GVG company a controversial contract of US$89.4 million to monitor and track revenues by the TELCOS in Ghana. The said contract generated a lot of controversies among many Ghanaians and the minority in parliament describing it as unnecessary and waste of tax payers money.

In 1911 Brown was the landlord of a public house in Chatham but by 1918, when he enlisted in the Royal Navy, he was working as an engineer. Brown, who had become eligible for service only after the Military Services Act raised the age limit for enlistment to between 41 and 50 in 1918, served at the former Royal Naval Air Service Experimental Station at Stratford as a Mechanic 2nd Class until the end of the war.

History The first mention of a church in Glossop is in the charter of 1157 conferring the manor of Glossop on Basingwerk Abbey. Although the dedication of the church to All Saints may indicate an Anglo-Saxon origin, no trace of such a church has been found. The first recorded vicar is William, of 1252. At this time the church was probably aisleless. When the taxation roll of Pope Nicholas IV was drawn up in 1291, the rectory of Glossop was valued at ¬£34 13s. 4d. (). It was altered in the 15th century when the nave was rebuilt with arcades, aisles and an arch at the east end of the north aisle. At the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the Valor Ecclesiasticus gives the value of the vicarage as ¬£12 18s. 9d. (). In 1554 a new and taller tower with a broach spire was built 3 feet west of the old tower, incorporating the east wall of the previous tower. The nave was completely rebuilt in 1831, with removal and replacement of much of the old fabric including the tracery of the aisle windows. The work was carried out by the firm of E. W. Drury of Sheffield, the cost far exceeding the initial estimate of ¬£700 (). The architects were Matthew Ellison Hadfield and John Grey Weightman. When the nave was rebuilt in 1914 it was discovered that the arch leading to the chancel had been partly made up of plaster, the wall supported by this arch had not been bonded into the existing chancel walls, and the \\"oak\\" roof bosses were also plaster. Between the pillars of the nave sleeper walls had been built to a higher level than the pillar bases. These walls appear to have been needed to counteract the effects on the church structure of a combination of excess drainage from the nearby hillside and the numerous burials inside the church. The pillars of the new nave of 1914 were superimposed on the bases of the old pillars, and the floor built up to cover the sleeper walls. The tower and chancel were demolished and rebuilt in 1853‚Äì55, the new tower also having a broach spire. It was paid for by the Duke of Norfolk. The chancel was again rebuilt in 1923, completing the architect C. M. Hadfield's plan of 1914. It was the gift of churchwarden Harriet Jackson in memory of her husband Isaac, a local industrialist and great benefactor to the town. Neath Ancient Moss (1987) Text by Paul Bush; published by subscription by parishioners.The present church has a nave of 5 bays, 25 yards long by 16 yards wide, with north and south aisles, and a chancel of 14 yards by 7 yards with a north aisle dedicated as St Catherine's Chapel.Parochial Church Council (N.D.), A Guide To The Parish Church Of All Saints, Glossop., British Publishing Company, Gloucester. pp 5‚Äì17. Organ An organ was installed in 1871 by Brindley & Foster. This was replaced in 1984 by an organ from the Unitarian Church in Glossop which was originally from 1910 by Norman and Beard. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.  Clock  The clock had no face until 1740 with its bell being the timekeeper for the town. The present clock dates from 1883 and was made by William McFerran of Manchester. It was the gift of Samuel Wood, a Glossop cotton mill owner. Unusually for a church clock, it only has one face which is on the west side of the tower. It is still driven by its original weight and pulley mechanisms. Bells There was originally a separate bell-house in the churchyard which was a low building surrounded by railings but in 1709 the medieval bells were replaced by six bells described as \\"very deep in tone\\" which were bought from Woodford in Cheshire and installed in the tower. These bells were recast by James Harrison of Barton-upon-Humber in 1816. In 1854 two additional treble bells were added when the tower was rebuilt. The ring was rehung in 1880 and the whole ring was recast in 1923 by Gillett & Johnston. A major refurbishment was completed in 2018 with the replacement of the clock room floor and the rehanging of the bells and replacement of most of the running gear.

Location The Mendanha State Park is divided between the municipalities of Nova Igua√ßu and Mesquita, Rio de Janeiro. It has an area of . The park fully protects the third rocky massif of the metropolitan region, and forms a mosaic of conservation units with the Pedra Branca State Park and the Tijuca National Park. The park contains many tributaries of the Guandu River, which supplies water to the municipalities of the city of Rio de Janeiro and the Rio Grande region. History The Gericino / Mendanha Massif was declared an Atlantic Forest Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1992. Before the park was created the area was protected by an environmental protection area, a less strict form of protection than a state park. At the time of creation the state environmental secretary Carlos Minc said the massif had been suffering from clandestine mining, illegal extraction of natural resources, and uncontrolled leisure and tourism activities. The Mendanha State Park was created by state decree 44.342 of 22 August 2013. The objectives are to protect and assist the recovery of the natural environment and landscapes of great scenic beauty, a densely forested area that shelters rare and endangered species, as well as to protect the water resources of the region. The park is part of the Carioca Mosaic, established in 2011. An environmental police unit was to be established to patrol the park by 2014. The federal government filed an action in 2015 against the state of Rio de Janeiro to suspend creation of the park on the grounds that much of it is on federal land that was being used as the army's Gericin√≥ Training Area. The firing range is dangerous due to live explosive devices. The army had not been consulted in the meetings before creation of the park, and the state seemed to have ignored the fact that much of the land was federal property. Environment The park holds forest remnants with a high level of biodiversity. Flora include jequitib√°-rosa (Cariniana legalis) and cedro-rosa (Cedrela fissilis). Fauna include jaguarundi (Puma yagouaroundi), lowland paca (Agouti paca) and a reduced population of tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella).

Through his mother, H√©l√®ne de Cazalet, he also descended from a family of Huguenots from the C√©vennes. Mac-Avoy studied in Switzerland where he received his baccalaur√©at. His artistic talent caused a brief hesitation between theatre and painting, but having chosen the latter, he entered the Acad√©mie Julian at the age of 18 and studied there with Paul Albert Laurens. In Paris, he frequented the house of Felix Vallotton and met Bonnard and Vuillard who showed an interest in his work.  Career  Mac-Avoy sold his first painting to the government when he was only 19 years old. It was exhibited at the Mus√©e du Luxembourg. He then branched out into landscapes, urban scenes and portraits, before devoting himself almost exclusively to the latter genre. At the Salon des Tuileries, in 1936, he exhibited only portraits in a style so distinctive and discordant to current fashions that he was compared to a Philippe de Champaigne. In 1939, he married Anne Coquebert de Neuville, with whom he had three children. Dominique, Patrick and Pascale. When the Second World War broke out, he was mobilized and joined the 5th Division of Motorized Infantry. Mac-Avoy received the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 and his experience of war is said to have influenced his style.

The steep-sided shell is formed of six plates finely striped vertically with reddish-purple and white. There are relatively wide, reddish radii between the plates where they fuse. The mantle, visible through the wide aperture, is margined with red, orange, yellow and blue. This barnacle could be confused with Megabalanus coccopoma, but that species is paler, has a smaller aperture and narrower radii between the plates. Distribution and habitat Megabalanus californicus occurs in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in the subtidal and intertidal zones of rocky shores. Its range extends from northern California southwards to the Gulf of California. It usually grows in groups and is most common on pilings and buoys. In a year following an El Ni√±o event, it is often found to have increased its distribution northwards. Biology In common with related species, Megabalanus californicus is a hermaphrodite and broadcast spawner. The eggs are retained in the mantle cavity where they are fertilised, the developing nauplii larvae becoming planktonic. After six stages these develop into zoea larvae which settle on the seabed, cement themselves to the substrate and undergo metamorphosis into juveniles.

During a dance presentation to welcome Princess Ama to the kingdom, Prince Daraima is shocked to see that one of the dancing maidens is Ihuoma-a girl whose hitherto exists only in her dreams. Unbeknownst to him, this is Iko, a poor maiden in the village who is an exact replica of Ihuoma and strangely possessing the same singing genius. Princess Ama observes her groom-to-be captivated by Iko and resolves to nip this obvious threat in the bud. Cast * Adesua Etomi as Iko and Ihuoma * Majid Michel as Prince Ekong * Ime Bishop Umoh as Aniefiok * Wale Ojo as Prince Daraima * Theresa Edem as Princess Ama Themes The film harbors qualitative musics, sung through the beautiful voice of the lead character Iko. It also brings to notice the cultural dance of the people it explores. Speaking on the movie, the writer Vivian Chiji describes it as a magical fusion cultural film. This description comes from the fact that when Iko sings in Prince Daraima's dreams, flowers blossom, and birds gather, coupled with the fact that Iko is having the same resemblance and genius as Ihuoma in real life. The movie also talks about envy, as Princess Ama's wrath befalls upon Ihuoma on observing her relationship with the prince. An important theme in this film that must not be forgotten is the love that binds Ihuoma mysteriously to the prince. Production Emem Isong formally announced the arrival of a new film to be titled Ayamma on an interview in Lagos. Before then, she'd got in mind to do something that was going to portray her culture, she says: \\"I feel there are times we need to go back to our roots, so that is what I am doing.\\" And so, when the script came, she grasped it, and determined to make a huge deal out of it. Shooting of the film was done at locations in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, the producer's homeland. It received funding from various sources, including a loan from the Bank of the Industry. Emem Isong says it's a high budget film, and in an interview, she disclosed her reasons of investing so much on it. A website was launched with the film's title on 11 August to promote it. Adesua Etomi who played the lead role had to learn some of the culture of the Ibibio people, majorly their dance steps and musics in other to interpret the role properly since she was one not from the Ibibio. Release The film premiered in 13 December 2016, and began airing in cinemas subsequently. The film poster was released in May 2016, and then the character poster followed. Music The music was scored and composed by George Nathaniel and Eveazi, who'd also collaborated with the production company in the making of their previous film Knocking on Heaven's Door which also stars Adesua Etomi in lead role.

Early life  Jorge Abraham Hazoury Bahl√©s was born to Lebanese parents in Barahona on 20 August 1924, wherein he had elementary and secondary studies. He graduated from Medicine in 1950 at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. He married Mercedes Toral and had 4 children, among them, the businessman Ricardo Hazoury, the founder of Cap Cana.  Fight against diabetes  With a vision of the future and aware of the need to protect Diabetics, Hazoury founded on 9 November 1966 the Dominican Diabetes Society (SODODIA) and the Diabetes Control Board in 1972. As a dependency of the Board of Trustees, in 1979 he created the National Institute of Diabetes, Endocrinology and Nutrition (INDEN), to offer medical services to the most needy classes in the country. Through various efforts, the writing of scientific articles and the benefit of marathons performed inside and outside the country, managed to inaugurate in 1983 the School for Diabetics Hospital where it offers all the specialties of Medicine to the Dominican diabetics. In 2004 this school was given the name of Dr. Hazoury Bahl√©s in recognition of his years of struggle against diabetes.  Universidad Iberoamericana  Hazoury founded Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE) on 12 July 1982, as a result of the initiative expressed by the Ibero- American Cooperation Institute and a steering committee in the Dominican Republic. Hazoury was its first Rector until 1991, with an enrollment that surpasses at present the 5,000 students and 20,640 graduates. Similarly, he began the Residency in Diabetology and Nutrition in 1988 and the Residence of Ophthalmology in 1991. Both with operations in the INDEN and from which have come notable Dominican and foreign specialists.

On his first-class debut in December 1892, which was also the first-ever Sheffield Shield match, Pierce opened the bowling for New South Wales and took 8 for 111 and 5 for 154, but South Australia nevertheless won by 57 runs. A week later, in the second Sheffield Shield match, he took 6 for 100 and 1 for 63 against Victoria, but again he was on the losing side. Despite this brilliant beginning to his career he quickly faded from the first-class scene, apparently through lack of ambition. He died after a long illness.

In 1989 it became the National Asthma Campaign and in 2004, when support for people with asthma had become more important, it changed its name to Asthma UK. Activity It established a new Centre for Applied Research in asthma in 2014. In January 2017 it published the results of a survey of 4,650 patients showing that about 3.6 million people across the UK were not getting adequate routine care for their asthma. This should include an appropriate annual asthma review (more often for severe cases and children), the right medication and knowing how to use it, and a written asthma action plan. In a further report published in August 2019 they showed that only 18% of patients with severe asthma ‚Äî those prescribed high-dose inhaled corticosteroids ‚Äî were referred to asthma specialists in secondary care.

Flegr's previous research in toxoplasmosis is also mentioned. The book also discusses Flegr's model of \\"frozen plasticity,\\" a hypothesis which describes a possible mechanism for the evolution of adaptive traits. This hypothesis proposes that natural selection can only explain adaptation for a limited range of conditions, for instance when populations are genetically homogeneous. He describes frozen plasticity as being more general, and maintains that it better explains the origin of adaptive traits in genetically heterogeneous populations of sexual reproducing organisms.Flegr, Jaroslav (1999).

Also known as the New Coates House Hotel, it was built in 1889‚Äì1891 incorporating parts of an earlier hotel, which had been built in the late 1860s as the Broadway Hotel and then become the Coates House after a change in ownership. In 1978, when it had become primarily single-room occupancy for transients, it burned in the deadliest fire in the city's history. It was subsequently restored and is now an apartment building. First hotel The first hotel on the site, at 10th Street and Broadway, was designed in 1857 by John Johnson, an English architect who later became the third mayor of Kansas City, as part of the development of former farmland owned by Kersey Coates that later became the neighborhood of Quality Hill; at the time it was ten blocks south of downtown. The building was unfinished when the Civil War broke out; Union forces used the foundations for a cavalry barracks, part of Camp Union.National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Coates House Hotel.Jason Roe, \\"The Worst Fire in Kansas City History\\", Kansas City Public Library, January 27, 2014.

Colonel Eldridge was already well known for his other hotel, the Eldridge House, which he rebuilt three times in defiance of a local pro- slavery judge and sheriff who fired on his hotel with a canon and then set it ablaze.The Eldridge Hotelhttps://eldridgehotel.com/our-story/ Broadway Hotel was a five-story brick building with a mansard roof. It did not prosper, and in 1870 Coates acquired it and it was renamed the Coates House. In the 1860s, Coates had built an opera house diagonally across 10th Street; it and the hotel catalyzed the development of a wealthy neighborhood. Beginning in 1886, Coates added a new wing at the south end; President Grover Cleveland and his wife Frances stayed there in October 1887.\\"Historic Coates House Marks the Survival of Demolition with Honorary Plaque and Celebration on August 14th\\", Historic Kansas City Foundation, August 1, 2009 (press release). Second hotel Coates had died in April 1887. Beginning in 1888, his widow and family demolished the original hotel and rebuilt it on the same site as the New Coates House Hotel, while enlarging Coates' addition. President Benjamin Harrison stayed in the addition in 1890, before rebuilding was complete. The new hotel opened on January 10, 1891. This building, the northern section of which survives, was designed by Van Brunt & Howe; it has six stories and is of brick with stone ornamentation and stone courses on the upper floors, and white-painted stone with brick courses on the first floor. A balcony extends across each of the two main facades, on Broadway and 10th Street. The building originally had a crenellated parapet inscribed with \\"Coates House\\" on both main facades, and turrets or belvederes at the corners; these have been removed, as have the chimneys. It originally formed a rectangle around a central courtyard; the four-story east side, which housed services such as laundry and storage and rooms for employees, was later mostly demolished, leaving a U-shaped building. The new hotel had a marble main staircase and offered services including a barber shop, a florist's, a bonnet shop, and Turkish baths. It remained a prestigious hotel for several decades; guests after the reopening included Presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt, Edwin Booth, William Jennings Bryan, and Oscar Wilde.

The assassination was apparently a conspiracy between Badr and the Fatimid court under Sitt al-Mulk. Badr was ultimately forced to relinquish his post and arrested shortly thereafter. Life Badr was either of TurkishZakkar 1971, p. 61. or Armenian origins.Dadoyan, p. 78. He was originally a ghulƒÅm (slave soldier; pl. ghilmƒÅn) of the Fatimid governor of Damascus, Manjutakin,Dadoyan, p. 80. until being acquired by Aziz al-Dawla Fatik; the latter was also a former Armenian ghulƒÅm of Manjutakin. During Aziz al-Dawla's reign as the Fatimid governor of Aleppo, beginning in 1017, he appointed Badr as the commander of the ghilmƒÅn and governor of the Aleppo Citadel. This demonstrated that Aziz al-Dawla placed significant trust in Badr. Aziz al-Dawla ruled with virtual independence and maintained his own relations with the Byzantine Empire, Aleppo's powerful, northern neighbor and enemy of the Fatimids. This alarmed Sitt al-Mulk, the effective ruler of the Fatimids. Under her direction, the Fatimid court in Cairo sought to eliminate Aziz al-Dawla; to that end, Sitt al-Mulk conspired with Badr, sending him secretive correspondence, carried either by official envoys or anonymous merchants.Zakkar 1971, p. 61. According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the secret letters to Badr may have been delivered by Fatimid envoys from Cairo carrying gifts to Aziz al-Dawla, which allowed them access to Badr. Badr used Aziz al- Dawla's affection of another ghulƒÅm, an Indian named Tuzun, as an avenue to assassinate him. Badr warned Tuzun that Aziz al-Dawla had intended to kill him on several occasions only to be stopped by Badr's interjection. Badr won Tuzun's trust, and the latter, fearful of his own death at Aziz al-Dawla's hand, cooperated with Badr on a plot to assassinate their master. They decided to act on 6 July 1022. That day, Aziz al-Dawla had returned to his sleeping quarters after a day of hunting and drinking with Badr.Zakkar 1971, p. 63. In this intoxicated state, Aziz al-Dawla went to bed, and Tuzun, who typically attended to Aziz al-Dawla, took the latter's sword and struck off his head. Badr then betrayed Tuzun by letting out a yell accusing his co-conspirator of murdering their master. This gained the attention of the other ghilmƒÅn who attacked and killed Tuzun. After the assassination, Badr reported Aziz al- Dawla's death to the Fatimid court, which publicly mourned the death of their Aleppine governor whilst they quietly rejoiced. Badr was appointed Aziz al- Dawla's replacement and was bestowed the title of wafiyy al-dawla wa-aminahƒÅ (loyal and trustworthy one of the state). According to Zakkar, the title is evidence of both Badr and the Fatimid court's role in the assassination. At the same time, Zakkar asserts that Sitt al-Mulk's role in the affair was \\"questionable\\", but this was the consensus of the medieval chroniclers. Badr's appointment was effectively used by the Fatimids merely as a temporary arrangement until a more suitable candidate could be found.Zakkar 1971, p. 64. Badr was sent correspondence from Cairo via Ali ibn Ahmad al-Dayf of Afamiya to reassure him of the Caliphate's goodwill toward him. Nonetheless, in the meeting between Badr and al-Dayf, the former was persuade to relinquish the governorship, which he had officially held for ninety-six days.

If a candidate who doesn't fall under castes recognised as SC/ST/OBC by the Govt. of India & his/her annual family income is below the prescribed limit of ‚Çπ8 lakhs by Government of India (or as prescribed by state govt in the respective states), then he/she will be recognised as EWS category. History On 7 January 2019, Union Council of Ministers had approved 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions for the Economically Weaker Section in the General category. It was decided by the cabinet that this would be over and above the existing 50% reservation. On 12 January 2019, The Economic Weaker Section Reservation Bill Article 15(6) and Article 16(6) which ensures 10% reservations to the poor and lower-middle-class people in upper castes who were denied any kind of affirmative action previously, was cleared by the President of India, Ram Nath Kovind. The EWS bill was tabled in Lok Sabha, the Lower House of the Indian Parliament on 8 January 2019 and it was passed on the same day [124th Amendment Bill]. The EWS Bill was passed by Rajya Sabha, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament on 9 January. The President approved the Bill on 12 January 2019 and a gazette was released on this bill which turned it into a Law. Gujarat became the first state to enact this law on 14 January 2019. An NGO 'Youth For Equality' has questioned and challenged the bill in the Apex court on grounds that it breaches the ceiling of 50% reservations set by Supreme Court of India, stating that it fully supports the reservations of the Economically Weaker Section but wants it to be amalgamated with the OBC quota which stands at 27%, thus not breaching the 50% cap set by the Apex Court. Leaders of the Backward classes have also decided to approach the Supreme Court over this issue. On 25 January 2019, The Supreme Court refused to stay the 10% reservation given to GEN-EWS category in government jobs and educational institutions.  Provision  The Union Government of India tabled the Constitution (One Hundred And Twenty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 2019 which provided 10% additional quota for the EWS students amongst the erstwhile Unreserved category or General category students. The terms Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Economically Backward Class (EBC) are not meant to be confused with each other in India. The definition of EWS has been defined by the Government of India whereas the definition of EBC and Most Economically Backward Class (MEBC) vary in different states as well as institutions. There is no official figure for the percentage of the Indian population who belong to the EWS category, but they were given 10 percent reservation. The eligibility to get the EWS certificate is not only purely based on annual family income but also based on the held property. The income limit has been set by the central government for admission to central government-owned colleges and jobs offered by the central government. State governments are given the authority to change the eligibility criteria and also to extend the income limit further for candidates seeking reservation under EWS category which will be valid only in state-owned colleges and state government's jobs as deemed fit for the respective states. People belonging to Economically Weaker Section since 1 February 2019 now get 10% reservation in education (supernumerary seats created for EWS category) and government jobs of India (vartical reservations) similarly like OBC, SC, ST. There was huge unrest among people which came out in many ways including the form of anti- reservation agitations.  Effect on agitations  This reservation weakened the pace of many reservation agitations such as the Jat reservation moment, Patidar reservation movement and Kapu reservation movement. Aspirants from the EWS category are not fully satisfied with this reservation because it does not include many benefits like age relaxation, fee relaxation, post metric scholarship and house criteria from the very beginning. When the detailed notification of EWS reservation was announced by DoPT, candidates started their protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi under the banner of EWS Arakshan Manch led by Trinetra Singh and his team mates.They are also encouraging intense political lobbying for their cause. The Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Dr. Thawar Chand Gehlot announced that the government would provide all benefits of reservation which are available to caste based reservation. Many opposition leaders raised this demand in favor of EWS Candidates. BJP's member of parliament Mr. GVL Narasimha Rao also raised this issue in the budget session of parliament in 2020. This demand has also been covered by multiple mainstream news sources. EWS Arakshan Manch is campaigning on social media platforms by videos, posts and tweets. Current definition of Economically Weaker Section The definition of Family in EWS reservation means:-\\"The person who seeks benefit of reservation, his/her parents and siblings below the age of 18 years as also his/her spouse and children below the age of 18 years\\". * Candidate's annual family income must be less than Rs. 8 lakhs per annum. * His family must not own more than 5 acres of agriculture land. * The residential flat area should be below 1000 sq ft.https://dopt.gov.in/sites/default/files/ewsf28fT.PDF * The residential plot's area should be below 100 square yards if in a notified municipality sector. * The residential plot's area should be below 200 square yards if in a non-notified municipality sector. EWS certificate can be used to avail the 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section in higher education all over the India and government jobs.

Life  G√≥mez Jattin was born in Cartagena, Colombia, to journalist Joaqu√≠n Pablo G√≥mez Reynero and Lola Jattin. His mother was of Lebanese, and Syrian ancestry. He spent most of his childhood in the town of Ceret√©, and then sent to his maternal grandmother in Cartagena, where he finished his secondary education. His father possessed a large library, and G√≥mez Jattin became an avid reader from a very young age, which was helped by his asthma. After spending a few years as a secondary education teacher in Ceret√©, he moved to Bogota, in 1964, to obtain a degree in law from Universidad Externado, under pressure by his father. It was in this university where he first came into contact with theatre, becoming part of the university's experimental theatre group, and where he started to write poetry first. He went back to Ceret√© without finishing his studies, at a time where the death of his father triggered the first of many psychotic episodes that would afflict him for the rest of his life. He was diagnosed with manic- depression and schizophrenia. At this time he also started consuming illicit drugs. He spent his time between psychiatric institutions and living in the streets as a homeless individual. He moved later to Cartagena, where the cycle of psychiatric admissions and homelessness continued, in addition to some time spent in jail. In the middle of what was assumed to be a psychotic episode, G√≥mez Jattin jumped to death in front of a running bus on May 22, 1997. It has never been clear whether his death was accidental or a suicide. He was a distant relative and close friend of journalist and writer Juan Gossa√≠n when they both studied in the same school in Cartagena.  Poetry  His reading of poets Machado, Garc√≠a Lorca, Rub√©n Dar√≠o, Fernando Pessoa, Cavafy, and many others inspired him to become a poet himself. He first started to write poetry while doing theatre in Bogota. Following his return to Ceret√©, G√≥mez Jattin had been devoted at first to theatre, as an actor, and then as director and playwright. By this time, he had also come into contact with illicit drugs and started showing the first signs of mental illness, having been interned in a psychiatric hospital for the first time in 1978. With the economic support from his friend Juan Manuel Ponce, he managed to publish his first poetry book Poemas (1980). Journalist and writer Milc√≠ades Ar√©valo received the book, and decided to publish a couple of his poems in Puesto de Combate, the literary magazine he had founded in 1972. Ar√©valo was responsible of making his work well known around the whole country, just at the time where his continuous cycle of mental health crises and periods of homelessness. His poetry has been described as stark and realist, and highly autobiographic, dealing with his struggles with mental illness, his solitude, his childhood memories, his sexuality, his friends and relatives, and his city. His most well-known book, Tr√≠ptico Cereteano, was published in 1988, and it gave him renown, which allowed him for the next years to appear in literary festivals, radio shows, and magazines, and to teach writing workshops. His later work was badly received by the critics, as being hurried and of lesser quality and creativity.

They were investigating drug smuggling on the cruiser following the discovery of $3,000,000 (~¬£834,000¬£1 =$3.5965: ) of heroin on board after HMS Belfast had sailed from Honolulu, Hawaii, United States in May 1962. In September 1962, a crewman died in a fall on board the ship. He was buried in Bermuda. An inquest was unable to determine the exact circumstances that led to his death. In January 1968, Wave Baron supported Royal Navy ships taking part in the search for the submarine , which had foundered in the Mediterranean Sea. Wave Baron was withdrawn from service in December 1969 and laid up at HMNB Devonport. She was sold for ¬£6,500 in March 1972 to Dutch company N.V. Intershitra, but was resold. She arrived at Bilbao, Spain on 23 April 1972 for scrapping by Revalorizacion de Materials SA.

This places contextual integrity at odds with privacy regulation based on Fair Information Practice Principles; it also does not line up with the 1990s Cypherpunk view that newly discovered cryptographic techniques would assure privacy in the digital age because preserving privacy is not a matter of stopping any data collection, or blocking all flows of information, minimizing data flow, or by stopping information leakage. The fourth essential claim comprising Contextual Integrity gives privacy its ethical standing and allows for the evolution and alteration of informational norms, often due to novel sociotechnical systems. It holds that practices and norms can be evaluated in terms of: * Effects on the interests and preferences of affected parties * How well they sustain ethical and political (societal) principles and values * How well they promote contextual functions, purposes, and values. The most distinctive of these considerations is the third. As such, Contextual Integrity highlights the importance of privacy not only for individuals, but for society and respective social domains. Contextual Integrity‚Äôs Parameters The ‚Äúcontexts‚Äù of contextual integrity are social domains, intuitively, health, finance, marketplace, family, civil and political, etc. The five critical parameters that are singled out to describe data transfer operation are: # The data subject # The sender of the data # The recipient of the data # The information type # The transmission principle. Some illustrations of contextual informational norms in western societies, include: * In a job interview, an interviewer is forbidden from asking a candidate's religious affiliation * A priest may not share congregants‚Äô confession with anyone * A U.S. citizen is obliged to reveal gross income to the IRS, under conditions of confidentiality except as required by law * One may not share a friend's confidences with others, except, perhaps, with one's spouse * Parents should monitor their children's academic performance Examples of data subjects include patient, shopper, investor, or reader. Examples of information senders include a bank, police, advertising network, or a friend. Examples of data recipients include a bank, the police, a friend. Examples of information types include the contents of an email message, the data subject's demographic information, biographical information, medical information, and financial information. Examples of transmission principles include consent, coerced, stolen, buying, selling, confidentiality, stewardship, acting under the authority of a court with a warrant, and national security. A key thesis is that assessing the privacy impact of information flows requires the values of all five parameters to be specified. Nissenbaum has found that access control rules not specifying the five parameters are incomplete and can lead to problematic ambiguities.Martin, K and Helen Nissenbaum. \\"What is private about ‚Äòpublic‚Äô records data?\\" Targeted Submission: Fall Law Reviews. Nissenbaum notes that the some kinds of language can lead one's analysis astray. For example, when the passive voice is used to describe the movement of data, it allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that there is an active agent performing the data transfer. For example, the sentence ‚ÄúAlice had her identity stolen‚Äù allows the speaker to gloss over the fact that someone or something did the actual stealing of Alice's identity. If we say that ‚ÄúCarol was able to find Bob‚Äôs bankruptcy records because they had been placed online‚Äù, we are implicitly ignoring the fact that someone or some organization did the actual collection of the bankruptcy records from a court and the placing of those records online. Example Consider the norm: ‚ÄúUS residents are required by law to file tax returns with the US Internal Revenue Service containing information, such as, name, address, SSN, gross earnings, etc. under conditions of strict confidentiality.‚Äù Data Subject: A US resident Sender: The same US resident Recipient: The US Internal Revenue Service Information type: tax information Transmission principle: the recipient will hold the information in strict confidentiality. Given this norm, we can evaluate a hypothetical scenario and see if it violates the contextual integrity norm: Hypothetical: ‚ÄúThe US Internal Revenue Service agrees to supply Alice‚Äôs tax returns to the city newspaper as requested by a journalist at the paper.‚Äù This hypothetical clearly violates contextual integrity because providing the tax information to the local newspaper would violate the transmission principle under which the information was obtained. Applications As a conceptual framework, contextual integrity has been used to analyze and understand the privacy implications of socio-technical systems on a wide array of platforms (e.g. Web, smartphone, IoT systems), and has led to many tools, frameworks, and system designs that help study and address these privacy issues. Social media: Privacy in the public In her book Privacy In Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life, Nissenbaum discussed the privacy issues related to public data, discussing examples like Google Street View privacy concerns and problems caused by converting previously paper-based public records into digital forms and making them online. In recent years, similar issues happening in the context of social media have revived the discussion. Shi et al. examined how people manage their interpersonal information boundary with the help of the contextual integrity framework. They found that the information access norms was related to who was expected to view the information.Shi, Pan, Heng Xu, and Yunan Chen. \\"Using contextual integrity to examine interpersonal information boundary on social network sites.\\" Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. ACM, 2013. Researchers have also applied contextual integrity to more controversial social events, e.g. Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica data scandal https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/rfc_comment_shvartzshnaider.pdf The concept of contextual integrity have also influenced the norms of ethics for research work using social media data. Fiesler et al. studied twitter users' awareness and perception of research work that analyzed twitter data, reported results in a paper, or even quoted the actual tweets. It turned out that users' concerns were largely dependent on contextual factors, i.e. who is conducting the research, what the study is for, etc., which is in line with the contextual integrity theory.Fiesler, Casey, and Nicholas Proferes. \\"‚ÄúParticipant‚Äù Perceptions of Twitter Research Ethics.\\" Social Media+ Society 4.1 (2018): 2056305118763366. Mobile privacy: Using contextual integrity to judge the appropriateness of the information flow The privacy concerns induced by the collection, dissemination and use of personal data via smartphones have received a large amount of attention from different stakeholders. A large body of computer science research aims to efficiently and accurately analyze how sensitive personal data (e.g. geolocation, user accounts) flows across the app and when it flows out of the phone.Enck, William, et al. \\"TaintDroid: an information-flow tracking system for realtime privacy monitoring on smartphones.\\" ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) 32.2 (2014): 5. Contextual integrity has been widely referred to when trying to understand the privacy concerns of the objective data flow traces. For example, Primal et al. argued that smartphone permissions would be more efficient if it only prompts the user \\"when an application‚Äôs access to sensitive data is likely to defy expectations\\", and they examined how applications were accessing personal data and the gap between the current practice and users' expectations.Lange, Patricia G. \\"Publicly private and privately public: Social networking on YouTube.\\" Journal of computer-mediated communication 13.1 (2007): 361-380. Lin et al. demonstrated multiple problematic personal data use cases due to the violation of users' expectations. Among them, using personal data for mobile advertising purposes became the most problematic one. Most users were unaware of the implicit data collection behavior and found it unpleasantly surprising when researchers informed them of this behavior.Lin, Jialiu, et al. \\"Expectation and purpose: understanding users' mental models of mobile app privacy through crowdsourcing.\\" Proceedings of the 2012 ACM conference on ubiquitous computing. ACM, 2012. The idea of contextual integrity has also infiltrated the design of the system. Both iOS and Android are using a permission system to help developers manage their access to sensitive resources (e.g. geolocation, contact list, user data, etc.) and to provide users with control over which app can access what data. In their official guidelines for developers,https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface- guidelines/ios/app-architecture/requesting- permission/https://developer.android.com/training/permissions/usage-notes both iOS and Android recommend developers to limit the use of permission-protected data to situations only when necessary, and recommend developers to provide a short description of why the permission is requested. Since Android 6.0, users are prompted at runtime, in the context of the app, which is referred to as \\"Increased situational context\\" in their documentation. Other Applications of Contextual Integrity In 2006 Barth, Datta, Mitchell and Nissenbaum presented a formal language that could be used to reason about the privacy rules in privacy law. They analyzed the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach- Bliley act and showed how to translate some of its principles into the formal language. References See also * H.

She returned to live with her father when she was fourteen, helping run his business. By the age of 25, she was married to William Hicks with three children, and the family moved to New Zealand. However, the move was unsuccessful, and they returned to England a few years later.Elizabeth Crawford, The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866-1928, p.284 The 1881 census gives her profession as a certified midwife. She and William had eight children in all, but two died young. Inspired by her father's experience in the Chartist movement, Hicks joined the Democratic Federation in 1883, along with her husband and her daughter, Margaretta. She soon became known within the organisation for her focus on women's suffrage. She was elected to the executive council of the renamed Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in 1884, serving for a year. Hicks stood for the London School Board in 1885 and 1888, although she was not elected. In 1889, she founded the East London Ropemakers' Women, which represented poorly paid women, and through it she became prominent in the Women's Trade Union Association, and its successor, the Women's Industrial Council. In 1894, she joined the Trades Union Congress' delegation to the American Federation of Labour, with John Burns and David Holmes. She was struck by illness and so was unable to participate in the convention once she arrived, but she later addressed various meetings. Hicks was also a member of the National Union of Women Workers, the central National Society for Women's Suffrage, and the Women's Emancipation Union. In 1896, she worked closely with Charlotte Perkins Gilman, who toured the UK giving speeches on women's suffrage. She resigned from the Women's Industrial Council in 1908 to focus on her work with the Clubs' Industrial Association and, later, the National Organisation of Girls' Clubs. She remained involved with the SDF, and in 1914 was appointed as the women's organiser of its successor, the British Socialist Party.

She is known for her paintings, which often portray dreamlike scenes of lone female figures.  Early life and education  Kashiki was born in Kyoto City, Japan. In 2006, she earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in oil painting and in 2008, a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting, both from Kyoto City University of Arts. In 2011, she earned a PhD in painting from Kyoto City University of Arts.  Career  Despite her previous training in Nihonga, Kashiki's paintings are often compared to Surrealist works because of the \\"melted\\" quality of her subject matter and individualized technique. Kashiki reinforces themes that are found elsewhere in contemporary Japanese art such as providing immersive visual escapes from society's uneasiness left from recent natural disasters like the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. In 2011, she was featured in the \\"BYE BYE KITTY!!! Between Heaven and Hell in Contemporary Japanese Art\\" exhibition curated by David Elliott at the Japan Society in New York City, along with fifteen other contemporary Japanese artists.  Subject matter  The intricate details of Kashiki's work is said to be influenced by Buddhist art from the Heian period. Kashiki primarily paints female figures and is said to also draw inspiration from Bijin-ga style of depicting beautiful women, a central theme from the ukiyo-e genre of Japanese art. Her concern with specific details of the body, such as wrinkled skin, are reflected in a series of drawings from 2014. The settings in which these figures are placed are often \\"otherworldly backgrounds\\", which still appear to be loosely based on the city of Kyoto, Tomoko Kashiki's hometown. Interior spaces where she often situates her women are identifiable. The hallways, columns, windows, even electrical sockets provide a definitive sense of ground yet seemingly empty, varied, and flattened perspectives create \\"an imaginary and ethereal world with no specific temporal or geographic location\\".  Style  Kashiki carefully selects all of the elements of a painting based on a clear, \\"private philosophy of beauty\\". \\"...gesture, facial expression, pose, specific objects, background, location, situation, composition, surface texture, line thickness, nexus of layers, degree of blurring\\" all become relevant considerations to her vision. Fluid, organic and sensual elements like the effects of water are reoccurring themes in Kashiki's works, which she explains to be informed by her \\"fresh feeling of being alive\\". Dream, desire and yearning remain to be central motifs, which begin \\"bleeding into the surreal\\". Bodies and shadowy figures have unreal, distorted physiques ‚Äì featuring excessively long, flowing limbs ‚Äì a common characteristic to find in Surrealist art. Her settings are also seen as recognizably Surrealist in their vast, empty yet familiar nature.  Technique  Kashiki uses various painting mediums including acrylic, pastel, color pencil, and others. In some recent works, she has painted directly onto wooden panel. Since her graduate training, Kashiki began following a complex, ritualized process of her own. First sketched in pencil, her works are painted in acrylic, layer by layer onto a linen cloth mounted on large Chamfered wooden boards. Compositions are structured with overlapping, receding facets as she paints, sands and carves the surface of the panel, then repaints and pounces, layer over layer. This multi-step process has been seen as a physical articulation of Kashiki's own fleeting impressions ‚Äì the \\"flickering\\", fleeting landscapes of emotions and memories in her mind. In this way, Kashiki's paintings have been considered \\"a manifestation of [her] inner landscape\\".

It resides from depths of to , often at reef drop-offs. It looks like a plume of feathery appendages with radial symmetry. The branches of A. elisabethae are pinnate and distichous, and will orient themselves in the direction of the ocean current. It ranges in size from to . It is considered commercially important as it is harvested for analgesics and cosmetic creams. The compound that is believed to cause its beneficial effects is Pseudopterosin A, a diterpene glycoside, a selective analgesic. A. elisabethae is also used in fish tanks as a part of the commercial pet industry. The species has a Least Concern conservation status. Reproduction The female exposes her eggs to the water current by placing them on her reproductive polyps. Sperm will eventually come into contact with the eggs, and the fertilized egg will develop into a planula in 1‚Äì2 days. The larvae form a colony on the parent for 2‚Äì4 days and then will become free-swimming. The free-swimming larvae are ciliated and bilaterally symmetric. Once the larvae become free-swimming, they will usually settle near the parent organism, as they are negatively buoyant and will sink to the ocean floor, where they grow into adults and continue the cycle. Its mating system is thus polygynandrous. The peak reproductive times for A. elisabethae are between November and January.

A field goal from that range has a low rate of success but was chosen over punting or going for a fourth down conversion. The dead zone (also known as four-down territory) refers to an area on the field of gridiron football where an offense is on their opponent's side of the field, but kicking a field goal would likely be unsuccessful and punting the ball would not dramatically change field position. The dead zone may exist anywhere from the opponent's 33 to 43-yard line, where a field goal attempt would be between 50 and 60 yards and punting the ball would likely result in a touchback (the punt bounces into the opponent's end zone and they begin their drive on their own 20-yard line resulting in a net gain of 13-23 yards on the punt). The location and size of a football team's dead zone may vary, depending on the effective field goal range of the offensive team's kicker. A team's decision on fourth down in the dead zone whether to punt or attempt a field goal is also dependent on game score and time remaining. Many teams that find themselves in the dead zone prefer trying to convert a short fourth down rather than risk a missed field goal or punting the ball for minimal gain. However, as field goal kickers in the NFL have become increasingly accurate (especially from longer distances), the dead zone on an NFL football field has been moved back. For instance, as recent as 2013 NFL kickers were successful on 67.13% of their field goal attempts 50 yards or longer (a 50-yard field goal attempt means the offence was at their opponent's 33-yard line when attempting the field goal).

It was the first permanent orchestra formed of local musicians to be established in the town, in contrast to the earlier Birmingham Festival Orchestra, which consisted largely of outside musicians and only performed during the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival. By 1885 the orchestra was being described in the London press as \\"a really first-rate band of 80 skilled players\\" and notable conductors included Frederic Cowen, Charles Villiers Stanford and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. The composer Edward Elgar was employed as a violinist in the orchestra between 1882 and 1889. In 1883 the orchestra performed his Intermezzo moresque at Birmingham Town Hall, the first public performance by a professional orchestra of any Elgar composition. History Foundation The orchestra was founded by William Stockley in 1856 to support the Birmingham Festival Choral Society, to which Stockley had been appointed conductor the previous year. Dissatisfied with the organ accompaniment to his first performance of Handel's Messiah he suggested setting up a regular orchestra to accompany the choir, a proposal that an alarmed Choral Society committee passed by a majority of only four votes. Stockley immediately started recruiting musicians, later remembering how \\"as there were but few instrumentalists in the town, and those principally engaged at the Theatre Royal and the music hall, my task was a difficult one.\\" The financial risk of promoting orchestral concerts was initially shared between the Festival Choral Society and the musicians, with the society agreeing to give two thirds of the profit from an experimental first concert to the players. This arrangement continued for the first two years until 1858, when the increasing success and prosperity of the enterprise allowed the orchestra to provide a pre-arranged fee. Subscription concerts Despite the success of the orchestra its purpose until 1873 was still primarily to support the Festival Choral Society, whose standards Stockley improved to the point where in 1861 The Times declared them to be the \\"Champion Choristers of England\\" and in 1879 the composer Camille Saint-Sa√´ns could describe how they \\"perform as if they were the finest musicians in the world\\". In 1873, however, Stockley noted that \\"the singing of the choristers was considered to be much more advanced than the playing of the instrumentalists, and this was to be expected, inasmuch as the rehearsals for the choir were continuous, while the opportunities of the band were very limited.\\" To improve this situation and \\"give the gentlemen of the band the opportunity of gaining greater proficiency\\" he instigated a series of \\"Subscription Orchestral Concerts\\" at Birmingham Town Hall, independent of the Festival Choral Society, for which it was announced: The first subscription season saw Stockley incur a financial loss of ¬£100, but a society was formed by prominent local figures to provide financial support and guarantee continuation of the series in subsequent years. By 1885 the London-based Musical Times could describe the orchestra as \\"a really first-rate band of 80 skilled players\\" who achieved \\"a unity, precision, and perfect balance of parts which any Metropolitan organisation would envy\\". The orchestra developed an extensive repertoire: records show that its programmes included a total of 35 symphonies, 27 concertos, 55 overtures and between 50 and 60 orchestral suites. Guest conductors included Frederic Cowen, who conducted a performance of his own works in 1883; Charles Villiers Stanford, who conducted one of his own symphonies in 1887; and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, who appeared in 1886 conducting his own D Major Symphony. The orchestra also gave many opportunities to contemporary local composers, including Francis Edward Bache, whose Romance was performed in 1874; Frederick Bridge, whose Cantata was performed in 1885; and Herbert Wareing, who had an overture performed in 1886. Elgar The composer Edward Elgar played violin in Stockley's Orchestra for seven years from 1882 to 1889, seeking more professional experience than was available in his native Worcester. His first concert was on 30 November 1882 at Birmingham Town Hall, where he took part in a performance of a suite from Delibes' ballet Sylvia. He would perform in every concert the orchestra played from then until his final performance on 7 November 1889. His intensive participation in these concerts would give him insights into classical and romantic instrumentation that could not have been otherwise obtained and he would later declare \\"I shall always cherish my associations with Birmingham, where I have learned all the music I know when a member of Mr Stockley's orchestra\\". Stockley was initially unaware of Elgar's own compositions, but in 1883 the composer Herbert Wareing recommended them to him and showed him the score of Elgar's recently completed Intermezzo moresque, his first composition for full orchestra. Stockley \\"at once recognised its merit\\" and offered to perform it with the orchestra. This professional premiere of Elgar's first publicly performed orchestral work took place on 13 December 1883 and attracted national attention. Stockley later recalled \\"On my asking him if he'd like to conduct, he declined, and, further, insisted on playing in his place in the orchestra. The consequence was that he had to appear, fiddle in hand, to acknowledge the genuine and hearty applause of the audience\\" Further performances of Elgar's works took place over subsequent years. His 1884 work Sevillana ‚Äì dedicated to Stockley but first performed by August Manns in London ‚Äì was performed by Stockley's Orchestra in Birmingham in February 1885; and in February 1888 Elgar himself conducted the orchestra in a performance of his Suite in D. In September 1890 Stockley conducted the orchestra in a performance of Elgar's Froissart Overture three days after its Worcester premiere and ten years before it would be performed in London. Elgar's wife Alice recorded in the programme notes: \\"E. called and applauded onto the platform. A. very proud.\\" No more performances of Elgar's works were given after the composer left the orchestra in 1889, however, and the orchestra had disbanded by the time Elgar's first acknowledged masterpiece, the Enigma Variations, was published in 1899. Dissolution By the mid 1890s the ageing Stockley was beginning to seem outdated and his limitations were becoming obvious. The orchestra in turn started to attract adverse comment for its archaic instrumentation and \\"lack of players of reputation\\". In 1897 a syndicate of influential local citizens was set up to support the establishment of George Halford's Orchestra, which would be Birmingham's leading orchestra for most of the next decade. Stockley was advised by his friends to retire instead of face a likely financial loss and he conducted the orchestra for the last time on 11 March 1897. The orchestra resumed performances in December 1897 under the baton of Rowland Winn (1856‚Äì1924), who had been Stockley's pianist and amenuensis, but who lacked his predecessor's charisma. Although the series attracted notable soloists, including Vladimir de Pachmann and David Ffrangcon-Davies, it suffered poor attendances in the face of competition from Halford's new venture and from a series of orchestral concerts promoted by the Festival Choral Society under Charles Swinnerton Heap. After two further seasons the orchestra dissolved in 1899.

It is primarily used for visual regression testing of web applications and websites. The platform is developed and maintained by AgileEngine LLC. History Screenster was developed in 2014. Overview Unlike code-based solutions that use programming languages (e.g. Selenium or PhantomJS), Screenster operates as a scriptless/codeless tool. Instead of simulating user actions with scripts, Screenster offers record-playback test automation functionality, which means the platform records actual user interactions with the GUI. The recorded actions are then automatically re-run during the regression testing phase. Functionality * Visual baselines: when user interactions are being recorded, the tool captures UI screenshots and DOM snapshots after each user action. The screenshots are stored as visual baselines for further comparison. * Screenshot comparison: during the regression testing phase, Screenster takes new screenshots of the UI and compares them to the visual baseline. The differences are automatically highlighted. * Management of layout differences: the platform uses screenshot comparison to detect differences between the visual baseline and new screenshots taken during regression testing. If the differences result from an intended modification of the UI, testers can add them to the baseline. * Ignoring dynamic regions: it is possible to select UI areas that will be ignored during further comparisons. This feature is used for handling UI areas with dynamic content ‚Äî e.g. banner ads served from a third party server. * CI integration: the platform is compatible with continuous integration environments like Jenkins via a proprietary plugin. Screenster ships as a commercial solution that runs on a shared server on premise or on the cloud. Other functionality of the platform includes automatic management of timeouts and locators.

In 1867, the distillery was purchased by the Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five Cork distilleries. Production of whiskey at the distillery likely ceased soon afters its acquisition by the CDC. However, the distillery is known to have remained in use a bonded store by the Cork Distilleries Company for several years thereafter. In the mid-twentieth century, the distillery resumed operations as a gin distillery for a period of time, however, it has since been almost completely demolished. The distillery was notable for its use of an early continuous distillation apparatus, invented by the distillery's then co-owner, Joseph Shee.  History  The distillery began life on 12 May 1796, when two distillers, Robert Allan and Denis Corcoran purchased a dwelling house and maltings on North York Street (now Thomas Davis Street) from Bartholomew Foley, a draper. The malthouse had formerly been owned by Thomas Wood, a maltster, in 1780. In 1802, the Allan and Corcoran are recorded as working a 762 gallon still. In the years that followed, the distillery seems to have changed hands several times. Around 1812, the business was being run by two brothers, Thomas and Joseph Shee, Benjamin Hodges, and some others. Thomas Shee acted as the distiller working a 201 gallon still, while Joseph acted a marketing agent based in London. Hodges and the others may have been silent partners who provided capital but nothing else, as their connection with the distillery soon disappeared. Output was recorded at 100,000 gallons in 1828. In June 1830, the Shees entered financial difficulties, and ownership passed to Joseph Shee. Joseph continued operations using capital provided by James Kiernan under a mortgage, while Thomas Shee remained on as a distiller. In 1833, excise records show that the distillery paid a duty charge of ¬£26,716, which equated to about 160,000 gallons proof. By 1835, Kiernan took outright control of the distillery. When Kiernan died in December 1844, his will specified that the distillery should be put up for sale. It was purchased on 27 July 1845 by George Waters, who was previously a co-owner of Daly's Distillery on John Street, until the dissolution of the partnership following the death of one of the partners. Waters ran the distillery until his retirement around 1867, after which the distillery was purchased by the Cork Distilleries Company (CDC), in an amalgamation of five Cork distilleries. Under CDC, distilling ceased at the distillery in the 1880s, with production transferred to their nearby North Mall distillery. Subsequently, the Green Distillery was used as a bonded store for some time. However, in the mid- twentieth century, new equipment was installed in the Green Distillery, with production of gin occurring there for a period of time. According to Irish Distillers, who absorbed the Cork Distilleries Company in the 1960s, a warehouse on the site was used to store whiskey in bond until the 1980s. Since then, the distillery has been almost completely demolished, with only a small archway remaining. However, one of original pot stills is still in use, currently employed as an experimental still at the nearby New Midleton Distillery.  Notability  A sketch of Shee's Patent Still The distillery was home to an early continuous distillation apparatus, was which installed and used at the distillery for almost twenty years. The apparatus, which the distiller's co-owner, Joseph Shee, patented in 1834, was similar to Jean‚Äê√âdouard Adam's 1801 design, and consisted of a four pot stills connected in series. Though thought to have been effective, the apparatus was not widely adopted. In particular, as a more efficient apparatus, the Coffey Still was patented by another Irish distiller, Aeneas Coffey, in 1830.

The film was considered disturbing at the time of its release and was condemned by the Catholic Legion of Decency. Its initial distributor went out of business, and by 1994 it had not been in circulation for 30 years, and was considered a lost film. It was restored and re-released in 2016 to critical acclaim. Plot The film, set in Los Angeles, centers on a pair of drifters, Duke (Allen) and Boots (Oates). As the film begins, they are hanging out at a gasoline station on the Pacific Ocean. They menace the owner and steal from his store. Duke promises Boots that he will fix him up with a woman. They hitch a ride with a motorist (Jerome Cowan), whom they force to follow an attractive woman, Ann Carlyle (Manx), to her home. They break into an empty house next door, eavesdrop on her, and learn that she is unhappily married to an older man named Roger. They proceed to manipulate the woman, but Boots fails to have relations with her. The two men have a dispute which ends in Duke killing Boots. Roger returns home, fights Duke, and Ann shoots Duke. Cast * Corey Allen as Duke * Warren Oates as Boots * Jerome Cowan as Ed Hogate * Robert Wark as Roger Carlyle * Jules Maitland as gas station owner * Kate Manx as Ann Carlyle Production leftStevens and producer Colbert, a former literary agent, called themselves \\"America's only authentic New Wave filmmakers,\\" and were admirers of Fran√ßois Truffaut and Claude Chabrol. They had \\"lofty ambitions for Private Property,\\" as a result of which \\"the film's artiness enveloped it like the fog on California Highway One.\\" Despite their modest budget, they were able to obtain the services of Ted McCord, who had won an Academy Award for The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Conrad Hall, a camera operator hired for his ability to shoot underwater, who went on to win three Academy Awards. The film was produced for approximately $59,000 (one account says $59,421 and another $59,525) and shot primarily at director Stevens' home in the Hollywood Hills and a vacant house next door, with other scenes shot nearby at Malibu Beach and Sunset Boulevard. At the time of its initial release, it was a denied a seal by the Motion Picture Production Code and was rated \\"C,\\" or \\"condemned\\" by the Catholic National Legion of Decency for \\"highly suggestive sequences, dialogue and music.\\" However it was passed without any changes by the New York Board of Censors. The film was shot in 10 days by a crew of 37 men, with $400 of the budget going for furniture. To avoid overtime costs, the filmmakers sometimes had to stop shooting in mid-sentence. Daily Variety called it the most important film since Marty in its implications for young and independent filmmakers. Without a production code seal, the film was not able to obtain a mainstream distributor, but it grossed about $2 million due to enthusiasm for the film in Europe.  Restoration and re-release  After years of being lost, a print was discovered, and was restored by UCLA Film & Television Archive. Funding for the restoration was provided by the Packard Humanities Institute. Private Property was screened at UCLA‚Äôs annual preservation festival in 2015, and at Turner Classic Movies Classic Film Festival in 2016 and television premiere Saturday night, January 14, 2017. A Blu-ray release was planned for the summer of 2016.  Critical response  At the time of its 1960 release, reviewers were repelled by the prurience of the film. One of the more favorable reviews called the film a \\"harrowing and extended clinical picture of physical, sexual and mental violation.\\" A Los Angeles Times reviewer wrote that Oates and Allen are \\"young actors of great promise and little exposure,\\" but a The New Yorker reviewer wrote that the acting is \\"uniformly dreadful.\\" The reviewer said that Oates' character, Boots, was \\"like Lennie in Of Mice and Men only this time according to the Method.\\" Film Quarterly wrote that the film was \\"shaded pornography\\" that would offend women, and appeared to be a conscious effort to exploit the market in sex movies. The review said the film's \\"subliminal effects came across like sledgehammers intentionally.\\" It said that the film failed to convey emotions, and that \\"Hollywood has always been addicted to its own distorted reflections of reality and Private Property is just a new example of this mythomania.\\" Andrew Sarris wrote that film is \\"more ambitious than it is\\" and that McCord was \\"hired to shoot people through brandy snifters with such affected artiness that McCord should have known better even if Stevens didn't.\\" What lingers in the mind, he wrote, is \\"Stevens' flair for feelthy fetishism and the stupid blonde beauty of the late Kate Manx.\\" John F. Kennedy screening In an interview with Arthur M. Schlesinger in 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy recalled that she and John F. Kennedy viewed the film the night of the pivotal 1960 West Virginia Democratic primary because the movie they wanted to see was half over. She called Private Property \\"some awful, sordid thing about some murder in California‚Äîreally, I mean, just morbid.\\" She said that she and Kennedy were \\"terribly depressed by the movie\\" but were then cheered up by news of his primary win. Their friend Ben Bradlee recalled that they joked that because the film was condemned by the Legion of Decency, it would have helped him with some Catholic-hating voters in West Virginia if they had known about it. Critical response at re-release At the time of its re-release in 2016, the film received a Rotten Tomatoes score of 100%, reflecting widespread critical acclaim, and 80 on Metacritic, denoting generally favorable reviews. Film Comment said at the time of its re-release that the film was made with \\"enormous panache,\\" and that director Stevens shared his former boss Orson Welles's \\"taste for elegant but unsettling framing.\\" The film was praised by The New York Times as a \\"genuine rediscovery.\\" Times film critic Glenn Kenny called the film \\"a fascinating m√©lange of cinematic semiotics.\\" and that this \\"tense and upsetting film has more psychological depth and empathy than the comparable sensationalist fare of its time, and shudder-inducing cinematic style to spare.\\" Kenny praised Manx's and Allen's performances, but said that Oates \\"underplays what could have been a schematic 'Of Mice and Men'-derived dynamic.\\" Allen's portrayal of \\"an overconfident sociopath is consistently insightful enough to make you regret that he didn‚Äôt get more roles this meaty during his career.\\" The Guardian critic Jordan Hoffman called the film \\"energetic and entertaining,\\" and said that the film \\"seems, at first, mere fodder for raincoat-wearing deviants. But there‚Äôs too much negative space in the screenplay to leave it at that.\\" Critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote Private Property \\"deserves to be more widely seen for its ability to disturb artfully, without crude shocks, and for its sincere fascination with its characters‚Äô tortured psyches.\\" See also * List of American films of 1960 * List of rediscovered films References External links 1960 films 1960 crime films English-language films American black-and-white films American independent films American crime films 1960s rediscovered films Films set in California American films 1960 independent films 1960 directorial debut films Rediscovered American films ","title":"Private Property (1960 film)"},{"id":"52884359","text":"Nikolai Kryukov may refer to: * Nikolai Kryukov (gymnast) (born 1978), Russian artistic gymnast * Nikolai Kryukov (actor) (1915‚Äì1993), Soviet film and theater actor * Nikolai Kryukov (composer) (1908‚Äì1961), Russian composer ","title":"Nikolai Kryukov"},{"id":"52884363","text":"Martin Rittsel (born 28 March 1971 in V√§xj√∂) is a former Swedish cyclist.

The film stars David Oyelowo, Charlize Theron (who also produced), Joel Edgerton (Nash's brother), Amanda Seyfried, Thandie Newton, and Sharlto Copley, and follows a mild-mannered businessman who is sent to Mexico to deliver an experimental marijuana pill. When he is kidnapped by a drug cartel, he must escape alongside a hired mercenary. The film was released in the United States on March 9, 2018, by Amazon Studios and STXfilms.  Plot  In the Chicago offices of Promethium Pharmaceuticals, co-presidents Richard Rusk and Elaine Markinson receive a call from a company employee, Harold Soyinka, who claims he has been kidnapped in Mexico and that his abductors are demanding a ransom of five million US dollars. One day earlier, Harold, Richard, and Elaine arrive in Mexico where they meet Sanchez, head of Promethium's Mexico plant. Unbeknownst to Harold, it is revealed that Sanchez has been selling Promethium's latest product, medical marijuana in the shape of a pill, to a Mexican cartel. Promethium has decided to cut them off to avoid harming their upcoming merger. Later that evening, as Richard, Elaine and Harold have dinner, Harold secretly records Richard's and Elaine's conversations while he is away from the table. He learns from the recording the merger plans, which would result in Harold losing his job. That night, he also discovers that his wife is having an affair and wants a divorce. Sanchez informs cartel leader Villegas about them getting cut off by Promethium; Villegas maims Sanchez and, believing that Harold is Promethium's boss, orders his capture. Richard and Elaine leave Mexico the next morning without Harold when he seemingly disappears. Harold, hiding away at a motel, convinces the motel's operators, brothers Ronaldo and Ernesto to pose as kidnappers in an extortion plan in which he calls Richard pretending to be kidnapped in exchange for a hefty ransom. Richard calls his former-mercenary-turned-humanitarian brother Mitch to rescue Harold. Harold spends the evening at a bar, believing his scheme to have failed. The bartender alerts the cartel when he recognizes Harold. Two men arrive and kidnap Harold, but, while delivering him to Villegas, Harold overpowers them and crashes the car. The next morning, Harold is rescued by tourists Sunny and Miles, the latter of whom is working as a drug mule. The two take Harold back to Ronaldo and Ernesto's motel where all three had been staying, where Sunny befriends him. Soon, Ronaldo and Ernesto, who have been bribed by the cartel into helping them, attempt to kidnap Harold. However, Mitch arrives, defeats the brothers, and takes Harold with him. Mitch takes Harold to the airport to return him to Chicago, but he runs away. Mitch subdues Harold and injects him with a tracker to know where he is at all times. The men get on good terms with one another and devise a scheme to extort Richard for more money. When Mitch calls Richard to make that deal, Richard tells him that the company is planning to collect a large life insurance claim on Harold if he were to die, part of which Mitch would receive. Mitch reluctantly agrees to kill Harold. Harold and Mitch are spotted by Ronaldo and Ernesto on the streets. Mitch prepares to shoot Harold but cannot bring himself to do so as he has grown fond of him. The two are then attacked by the brothers, who kidnap Harold and take him to Villegas. Villegas kills the brothers and orders Harold to access a vault at the Promethium plant in order to steal the marijuana pill formula. There, a shootout occurs when the police arrive. During the battle, \\"Angel,\\" Harold's Mexican colleague and one of Villegas' men, whisks Harold away from the fight and reveals himself as an undercover DEA agent. They are chased by members of the cartel, who run them off the road. Harold saves \\"Angel\\" from being killed by a cartel member; as Harold is about to be executed by another cartel member, Mitch arrives and saves him only to be killed by the first cartel member, who Harold finishes off. Harold asks \\"Angel\\" for help, believing that he has nothing to return to in Chicago. \\"Angel\\" agrees to falsely declare Harold dead and Harold gives him company files incriminating Richard before leaving. Villegas, his men, and Miles the drug mule are arrested by Mexican police, aided by \\"Angel.\\" Richard is arrested by the DEA and imprisoned, and Elaine, who testified against Richard, takes over Promethium. Sanchez, despite his disability, settles down happily with his children. Harold, living quietly as \\"Harry Barnes,\\" stays in Mexico, opens a beachside bar, and remains in contact with Sunny.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale.

Together with experienced investigation employee Ivan Melentyev, he starts to fight the leader of the thieves' world who goes by the name of Korney. Vorontsov and Melentyev prefer different methods of work; if Melentyev relies on deliberate placement of his people in the criminal environment, then Vorontsov wants to act as quickly as possible. The complexity of the struggle against Korney is that he does not commit the crimes with his own hands but instead oversees their execution. Due to a successful operation judiciary police manages to plant their agent to Korney in order to find out the place and time of the upcoming thief gathering. But at the last moment he changes the gathering place. Vorontsov has no time to warn anyone and is forced to act alone.

He joined HMS Lion, at HMNB Devonport, a training ship for boy entrants. He completed his initial training in HMS Implacable, before joining HMS Nautilus for deep-sea training. After leaving the service in 1926 he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. He rose to Lieutenant Commander, later resigning his commission to start a new career in the Youth Service. In 1973 the value of his service to youth was recognised by the award of an OBE. In 1975, he published \\"Spun Yarn & Bell Bottoms\\",Spun Yarn & Bell Bottoms Book by F. P.

He is the founder and director of Justitia, a Copenhagen-based think tank focusing on human rights, freedom of speech, and the rule of law. For six years he served as chief legal counsel at CEPOS. Personal life Mchangama's mother, Ulla Danstr√∏m, is Danish, and his father, Said Mchangama, is from Comoros. In 2016 he married his long-time partner, Sarah Hammeken. They have two children, Leopold and Norma. Education and career In 2003, Mchangama received a law degree from the University of Copenhagen. In 2004, after studying in Venice and Strasbourg, he received an additional degree from the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation. He was an assistant professor in International Human Rights at the University of Copenhagen from 2005 to 2007, and an adjunct professor there from 2007 to 2012. From 2004 to 2007 he was a paralegal at Eversheds Sutherland. From 2007 to 2008 he was an attorney at Plesner (law firm). From 2008 to 2014 he was a chief legal counsel at CEPOS. He founded Justitia in 2014, and has been its director since then. Writings and speeches Mchangama's writings have appeared in many publications, including the Danish newspapers Dagbladet Information and Berlingske, Minerva (Norwegian periodical), and the American journals National Review and Foreign Affairs. He has written on such subjects as the oppression of women in Islam, the 2015‚Äì16 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany, and the danger of laws against ‚Äúhate speech,‚Äù blasphemy, and Quran-burning. In August 2011, he contended that the European left was using the recent mass murder in Norway ‚Äúto argue for limiting free speech‚Äù on the grounds that certain speech ‚Äúcan lead to murder.‚Äù Mchangama strongly challenged this premise. In a February 2012 article, he maintained that ‚Äúthe combination of a debt crisis, an aging population addicted to public welfare benefits, one and a half decades of low growth rates, and increasing competition...is revealing the dark underbelly of welfarism‚Äù in Denmark. ‚ÄúIt is not an overstatement,‚Äù he claimed, ‚Äúto say that the balance between the state and the individual has been shifted decisively in favor of the state.‚Äù Because of a growing need for higher tax income, the Danish government was now harassing citizens in ways that violated their rights, and was dangerously skewing ‚Äúthe balance between public welfare and the free market...in favour of the former,‚Äù thus revealing the tendency of the welfare state to eat away at ‚Äúthe capitalist foundation which sustains it‚Äù and the fact that welfare ultimately ‚Äúcomes not only at the expense of economic freedom but also individual freedom and choice.‚Äù In March 2013 Mchangama dismissed the ‚Äúputative consensus‚Äù around UN Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18, which was seen as resolving divisions between free-speech advocates and those who would criminalize defamation of religion, as a ‚Äúcharade.‚Äù While the US saw the resolution as affirming First Amendment-style speech rights, Pakistan saw it as permitting ‚Äúadvocacy of religious hatred.‚Äù In the middle sat Europeans, who, Mchangama noted, were often eager to defend Islam from criticism. While praising the US for ‚Äústanding firm on the need to counter intolerance and hatred through debate rather than censorship,‚Äù Mchangama called on the US to vigorously confront other interpretations of R 16/18. A February 2015 essay on the 26th anniversary of the fatwa against Salman Rushdie criticized the widespread notion that ‚Äúfree speech should not be 'abused' to insult the religious convictions of minorities,‚Äù and cited a recent declaration by President Barack Obama that when ‚Äúwe defend the legal right of a person to insult another‚Äôs religion, we‚Äôre equally obligated to use our free speech to condemn such insults.‚Äù Mchangama challenged this view, pointing to a recent London protest by Muslims who ‚Äúwere perfectly happy to exercise their right to free speech and association‚Äù but whose ‚Äúcore message was that those very rights should be denied to those with whom they disagree, and that insult to religious feelings is a kind of extremism not too dissimilar from that of the murder of cartoonists.‚Äù In a March 2, 2015, Wall Street Journal op-ed, Mchangama lamented the ‚Äúlong-running pattern‚Äù in Europe ‚Äúof bending to Islamist 'outrage' instead of defending free speech for all.‚Äù He noted with dismay that Denmark's current prime minister, Helle Thorning Schmidt, had demanded in 2006 that then-Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen distance himself from the Jyllands-Posten cartoons, that the Danish newspaper Politiken had agreed to a 2010 settlement in which it apologized for offending Muslims by reprinting Muhammad cartoons, and that Denmark‚Äôs former minister of foreign affairs, Uffe Ellemann Jensen, had expressed no sympathy for cartoonist Lars Vilks after an attempt on his life, even saying that Vilks ‚Äúhad asked and begged to be attacked.‚Äù Mchangama warned against the rise of ‚Äúoffense creep,‚Äù whereby jihadists were being permitted to limit debate, and urged the democratic Western world to push back. In April 2017, writing for The Washington Post, Mchangama called for Denmark to end its law banning blasphemy. He noted that, while Denmark ranked first in the 2016 \\"Rule of Law Index,\\" the country shared a ban on blasphemy similar to that of countries like Iran and Pakistan. Index on Censorship's publication featured a guest commentary by Mchangama in 2017. He criticized Denmark's blasphemy law, noting that \\"Denmark is turning towards a model of militant democracy where free speech is often seen as the problem rather than the solution, and as a hindrance rather than the foundation of social peace.\\" In October 2018, Quillette published a Mchangama article about the decline of free speech in cyberspace, pointing to recent policies changes by Facebook and Twitter, which had previously been strong advocates of free speech. He noted that these companies had previously adopted the American model 'viewpoint diversity' but then switched to the European model of \\"'balancing' free speech against competing interests\\". He noted the various inconsistencies in the application of such rules, such as the ban on denying the Holocaust while denying the Armenian genocide remains tolerated. In December 2018, Mchangama wrote with alarm about the proposal by President Donald Trump that news and entertainment critical of him \\"should be tested in the courts.\\" Mchangama wrote that \\"Trump‚Äôs constant attacks against the media may be eroding the very popular support\\" for the legal protection of free speech. In support of his views, Mchangama has made numerous speeches and public appearances and given many interviews. At the 2011 Oslo Freedom Forum Mchangama gave an address titled The West's attack on free speech.\\" In 2018, he was a guest on the podcast The Fifth Column. In October 2018, Spiked (magazine) interviewed Mchangama as his organization was instrumental in having the blasphemy law of the Republic of Ireland abolished by public referendum. Mchangama explained his motivation for focusing on freedom of speech: > I grew up in one of the most liberal, tolerant societies in the world: > Denmark. No one ever thought about free speech because it was just as > natural as breathing the air. And then we had the cartoon crisis, which was > the wake-up call for me. It has shaped both my interest in and understanding > of free speech, not only because it was such a dramatic event but also > because it dawned on me how vulnerable free speech is. In 2019, he participated in a panel discussion at New York University titled Hate speech on social media: is there a way to a more civil discussion. Also that year, he delivered a presentation in London on the history of free speech at Living Freedom, sponsored by Battle of Ideas. Clear and Present Danger podcast From February 2018 to February 2020, Mchangama wrote and narrated a serial podcast, Clear and Present Danger: A History of Free Speech. Among those lauding the podcast is psychologist Steven Pinker, who wrote, \\"We mustn't allow free speech to fade into a feel-good slogan. It is an unintuitive principle with a rationale that many don't appreciate and a history that many don't know. Mchangama's lucid history of free speech fills that gap and deepens our understanding of this precious concept.\\" Author Jonathan Rauch has said, \\"Free speech is the most successful social policy ever ‚Äî and also the most counterintuitive. Jacob Mchangama's delightful podcast series paints vidid portraits of the lives, ideas, and struggles of the people who brought this improbable principle to life.\\" In a review, podcast critic Elena Fern√°ndez Collins wrote approvingly: \\"Mchangama is an excellent historical guide, clear and precise, and with the right sense of drama when needed even though the episode has a practical focus rather than a theological or philosophical one. Interspersed throughout are expert opinion episodes, where Mchangama‚Äôs talent at guiding questions leads to a vibrant, insightful talk on a particular aspect of free speech.\\" At the end of the 40th episode, Mchangama announced that the podcast was ending regular production. Honors and awards Mchangama received the 2013 Freedom Prize from the political party Venstre (Denmark) for his involvement in the public debate about rights in Denmark and abroad. In his acceptance speech, Mchangama underscored that freedom and democracy do not come naturally, they need to be fought for as hard in a country like Denmark as in any other part of the world. ‚ÄúNo one has won freedom by being silent,‚Äù he declared. He has also received the 2015 Jyllands-Posten Free Speech Award, and the 2017 Blixen Award for contributing to freedom of expression.In 2019 he received the Hoerups Debatpris from Politikken.

Today, OkayAfrica is the largest US-based website focusing on new and progressive music, art, politics, and culture from the African continent.  History  In an interview with One Magazine, OkayAfrica Vice President Ginny Suss, stated, > We realized that there is no place on the web that acted as a hub for all > the new [African] music, culture, art and politics and the amazing culture > that was being generated on the continent that was really relevant to youth > culture today.

OkayAfrica created a digital space for modern African music and culture. In an interview with Black Enterprise Magazine, former CEO Abiola Oke underscores the sites popularity as a sign that African entertainment and music culture is going through a golden age online. At the age of 34, he was appointed CEO of OkayAfrica. OkayAfrica is one of the few websites that predominantly cover and center modern Afrobeats. OkayAfrica is also an event promoter and producer. On July 29, 2016, OkayAfrica organized Okayafrica: Afrobeat x Afrobeats, a concert headlined by Nigerian pop star Davido and Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas at the Lincoln Center Out of Doors, America's longest running free outdoor festival. This was the first time in history that African musicians had headlined the festival.  Audience  Since its founding in 2011, OkayAfrica has gained a strong following with Afropolitans, particularly those in the diaspora. The term is used to describe OkayAfrica's target audience, a new generation of Africans who are creative, politically aware, multicultural, and with roots firmly on the African continent. The site allows young people living in the diaspora to stay abreast of what's happening in their home countries. Oke says the site's main age group is 25-35. Today, the site attracts 1 million unique page views a month, mostly from the USA, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria. Additionally, the site offers different editions, covering all 54 countries in Africa to cater to the complexity of the continent. OkayAfrica popularity is also reflected in the site's social media presence It has 250,000 likes on Facebook, 100,000 followers on Instagram and 50,000 + followers on Twitter. 100 Women In 2017 okayafrica created a platform to highlight 100 leading African women. The list has been published each year since then. The list is assembled in ten categories STEM, media, music, literature, TV and film, sports and wellness, style and beauty, business and economics, politics and activism and art. The 2019 list was dedicated to youth culture and it was announced at the BAMcafe featuring Moonchild Sanelly. The emphasis was to find women who were disrupting their own local youth culture whilst at the same time demanding equal access to the global stage. Accolades from African writers and intellectuals The site has received praise from African artists and intellectuals. Nigerian sociologist Oreoluwa Somolu notes that one of the biggest selling points is that it's made by Africans for Africans. She believes OkayAfrica allows Africans to exercise control over their own narratives in mainstream media. Congolese Author, Alain Mabanckou writes that platforms like Okayafrica are important because they promote accessibility to information and participation in cultural, political, and social dialogue.

This provides a rather uncomfortable restraint and may result in injury to the individual if maintained for an extended period of time. When using a handcuff cover in combination with a belly chain, the hands may be cuffed in a parallel or in a stacked position. In the stacked position, the shackled person's freedom of movement is strongly restricted and the arms are kept in a rather unnatural position which may cause discomfort or even pain because in this arrangement, the individual's wrists are restrained in close proximity to the torso. parallel position In a parallel position, the restraint will cause the wrists to spread outwardly in an angular relationship. As the handcuff cover provides a rigid structure, the individual's wrists may be bruised or cocked, restricting blood circulation.

Roy, Andrew, History of the Coal Miners of the United States, Green Wood Press, pp. 133‚Äì134. In the Tuscarawas Valley, the labor action lasted six months, and in the Mahoning Valley four and a half months, ‚ÄúThe Mahoning Valley Strikers Superseded,‚Äù Cleveland Daily Leader, May 15, 1873, 2, GenealogyBank, https://www.genealogybank.com/ but the walkouts failed. The introduction of imported strikebreakers and manufacturers finding substitutes for the area's special block-coal, forced the organized miners back to work at prevailing wages.  Strike  As of 1872, bituminous coal miners in this location received $1.10 per ton of coal mined. Later that year, they demanded a $0.15 per ton increase. The mine operators responded with a demand for a decrease of $0.20 per ton. By January 1, 1873, over 6,000 unionized coal miners had walked out over the proposed 25% wage cut.\\"Disastrous Strikes Among Ohio Coal Miners,\\" The Evening Star, Washington, D.C, February 8, 1873\\" online page 1 The local and national press followed the events of the miners' walkout. They covered several violent confrontations between striking miners and replacement workers. The events around this local miners' action proved to be precedent setting in several ways. Mine owners employed the practice of importing replacement workers (strikebreakers) from far afield, from the Port of New York and other Eastern seaports, and from Virginia. As of February 6, with 7,500 strikers out, owners had imported the first 300 black replacements from Virginia, \\"and the experiment succeeds so well that other proprietors will probably follow suit.\\" The largest number of these were destitute Italians newly landed at New York City's Castle Garden Immigrant Station, and African Americans from the Richmond area.The Weekly Telegraph, Ashtabula, Saturday Morning, February 8, 1873, page 3 . Newspaper accounts record that the replacement miners were sent by rail to work mines in Coalburg, Hubbard Township and Church Hill, Liberty Township, Ohio.The New Orleans Republican, January 15, 1873, page 8Charles Carr, \\"Tales of the City's Industries,\\" The Sunday Vindicator, Youngstown, July 10, 1910, page 23 At the outset of their rail journey, neither the Italians nor the Virginia men knew their employment was contingent upon being replacement workers.The Canton Repository and Republican, Ohio, April 25, 1873, page 1 Throughout the strike and even afterwards, considerable violence and destruction resulted from clashes between strikers and strikebreakers.The Ohio Coal Miners' Strike,\\" The Daily Graphic, New York, May 14, 1873, page 3 Strikers engaged in physical attacks against replacement miners and miners who returned to work in Coalburg and in several nearby townships. Local papers recorded arson and one strike- related homicide, that of Giovanni Chiesa, aka John Church, both in Churchill.J. H. Odell, \\"Murder and Arson at Church Hill!\\", The Mahoning Vindicator, August 1, 1873, page 8  Aftermath  The appearance of the Italian strikebreakers marks one of the earliest recorded arrivals of Southern Italians in the Mahoning Valley. After the conclusion of the strike, many settled in Coalburg's Little Italy.http://www.beyond- books.org/docs/PDF/THEANDREWTUCCIARONEFAMILY.pdf , page 13 The actions of the coal mine operators may have also added to the number of African Americans settling in the Mahoning Valley. The tactic of exploiting immigrants and blacks as strikebreakers continued for several decades. This undermined coal miners' efforts to organize. The strike marks post-Civil War changes in the relationship between capital and labor. Importation of replacements from afar to control the workplace now became possible via new technology, the telegraph and railroads.\\"City Intelligence: Labor Exchange at Castle Garden,\\" The Evening Post, New York, November 4, 1867, 4.Chicago in the Age of Capital: Class, Politics, and Democracy during the Civil War and Reconstruction, Jentz John.B and Schneirov, Richard, Apr 15, 2012, University of Illinois Press, page 23, 978-0252081057 Although the miners' strike began nine months before the Panic of 1873, railroad construction had begun falling the year before as a result of Civil War over expansion.http://www.dhr.history.vt.edu/modules/us/mod05_industry/images/railroad_construction.jpg This had a deflationary effect on coal prices as the demand for iron and steel decreased. Strikes by the same coal workers continued at least through March 1876 in the Tuscarawas Valley, when a strike at the Warmington Mine south of Canton escalated into violence that required the insertion of state troops by Governor Rutherford B. Hayes to restore order. Young attorney William McKinley represented the unpopular miners without a fee, by highlighting the dangers of the industry ‚Äì 250 fatalities in the state every year, and another 700 injuries ‚Äì and the practices of local mine owners. One of those owners was Mark Hanna. Although opponents in the case, the two formed a political alliance that saw McKinley elected U.S. president in 1896.

Dodd synthesizes pigments from various organic and inorganic matter. Her work frequently invokes art historical and mythological symbolism. Dodd has been critically compared to mid-century artists Cy Twombly, Sigmar Polke, and Robert Ryman.  Early life and education  Dodd studied at the Art Center College of Design, California (BFA, 2004) and Bard College, New York (MFA, 2011). She lives and works in Kingston, New York.  Work  Dodd stages exhibitions with a dramaturgical approach, and considers her paintings \\"characters.\\" This staging typically consists of a ritual entrance, furniture and other decorative arts assembled in the style of a \\"bohemian bazaar,\\" and monumental canvas paintings. In a 2018 interview with artist Rashid Johnson, Dodd explained: ‚ÄúI think about painting in a theatrical way. [...] The paintings are actually characters that people have to interact with.‚Äù Dodd prefers her paintings be displayed in the round \\"as an object,\\" rather than flush against a wall. Her paintings are often dispersed throughout a gallery and visible on all sides.  Monumental painting  Dodd‚Äôs use of the monumental painting format refers to the gendered history of lyrical abstraction and action painting. Her debut New York solo exhibition at the project space No5A in 2013, The Studio Before 54, consisted of three large- scale paintings produced from the rubbings of various dry minerals, including graphite and iron glimmer. Listed materials also included ‚Äúthe souls of the shoes of Nanette Lepore, Margiela, Clergerie, a half calf cowboy boot, a no name mule, a foot with foss mud.‚Äù Throughout her work, Dodd uses both ‚Äútraditional pigments and those opportunity presents her,‚Äù such as SCOBYs, onion skins, avocado pits, tulips, and yew berries. These materials are sometimes site-specific; for example a series of paintings commissioned by the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2016 for its experimental five-part exhibition, Open Plan, in which she incorporated samples of water from the nearby Hudson River. Dodd understands each painting as ‚Äúan organic entity\\" and embraces its chemical ‚Äúpossibility of transformation.\\" In his review of her 2013 solo show Cake 4 Catfish at David Lewis Gallery, Jerry Saltz described Dodd‚Äôs ‚Äútopographic‚Äù paintings as ‚Äútwo-dimensional animals with inbuilt chemistries, going through secret artistic caramelizations and painterly photosynthesis, converting liquids and semisolids into bliss.‚Äù  Symbolism  In her practice Dodd explores ‚Äúthe exhibition as a ritualized space -- in which paintings conceived as characters, mythical and poetic fragments, or totems, are activated and transformed over a period of time.‚Äù Her work and its viewers are \\"cast\\" as ‚Äúprotagonists in a highly complex theatre of signifiers.‚Äù These signifiers are drawn from elemental, art historical, and religious iconographies such as: logarithmic spirals, the bony labyrinth, the Cretan labyrinth, the Georgian dragon, Greek mythology, astrological symbols, Venus and the Divine Feminine, Pablo Picasso‚Äôs Guernica, and mid-century modern furniture. Dodd conceived of a single monumental painting the exact size of Picasso's Guernica for an exhibition at the Rubell Family Collection in 2014. The durational project, titled Guernika, culminated three years of her research on the history and mythology of Guernica and Picasso. A corresponding book, The Genesis of a Painting, was released. Its title refers to the eponymous 1962 book by Rudolf Arnheim. The Genesis of a Painting remakes Picasso‚Äôs catalogue \\"into a visual epic where Dodd, the hero, is joined by two companions of her own creation: a starfish, a symbol of nature‚Äôs innate mirroring, and the Maize Mantis, a shepherd character loosely inspired by the King of Pop, Michael Jackson.‚Äù  Ritual and performance  Dodd‚Äôs performative approach to painting is often characterized as 'ritualistic.' She considers her paintings ‚Äúabsorbent‚Äù of both the visible and the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù conditions of their production, for instance the particular music Dodd plays in her studio; the ‚Äúsmoke, sage, copal, lavender, [and] cedar\\" she uses to ‚Äúdefume‚Äù her work; and the performers she enlists to ‚Äúactivate‚Äù an exhibition. Her paintings have been described as \\"unwieldy,\\" having been ritually \\"splashed, stained, or smoked\\" by their materials. Writes Rashid Johnson: ‚ÄúThese unlikely and far-from-archival sources of pigmentation are akin to a shaman‚Äôs brew, not only in their earthy origins but also in their activation through ritual. ‚Äù Dodd often incorporates performance into her exhibitions, and has collaborated with other musical and performance artists such as Dawn Kasper and Sergei Tcherepnin.  Exhibitions  Dodd has been exhibited at The Power Station, Dallas; Rubell Family Collection, Miami; David Lewis, New York; Spr√ºth Magers, Berlin; Mendes Wood DM, Sao Paulo; and Blum & Poe, Los Angeles; The Rachofsky Collection, The Warehouse, Dallas; Skarstedt, New York; Altman Siegel, San Francisco; Campoli Presti, Paris; Galleria Alfonso Artiaco, Naples; Kaufmann Repetto, Milan; Armada, Milan; Meyer Kainer, Vienna; ProChoice, Vienna; Front Desk Apparatus, New York; White Columns, New York; The Kitchen, New York, and Performa 11.

It was organized in 1990 by students, professors and workers' unions in Kosovo. It is part of similar movements throughout Albanian regions since the 1960s. History Gjakmarrja (literally \\"blood- taking\\", i.e. \\"blood feud\\") or Hakmarrja (\\"revenge\\") refers to the social obligation to commit murder in order to salvage honour questioned by an earlier murder or moral humiliation. This practice is generally seen as in line with the Albanian social code known as Kanuni i Lek√´ Dukagjinit, or simply the Kanun (English: The Code of Lek√´ Dukagjini). After 80', many Albanians were locked in their home because of the feud, this was followed by more murders, where even today there is such killings especially in Albania and North Macedonia. In Kosovo, where many families had sold many organizations were established for reconciliation for the reason that: \\"should stop the killings, because Serbia is killing us\\". In the course of the reconciliation campaign that ended blood feuds among Kosovo Albanians, the largest restorative justice conference took place at Verrat e Lluk√´s on 1 May 1990, which was attended by between 100,000 and 500,000 participants. The reconciliation campaign was led by Anton √áetta. Over a period of three years (1990-1992) approximately one third of the entire population of Kosovo were documented to be actively involved in restorative justice conferences to end the blood feuds. By 1992 the reconciliation campaign ended at least 1,200 deadly blood feuds, and in 1993 not a single homicide occurred in Kosovo.

The current lineup consists of guitarist and lead vocalist Clementine Creevy, bassist Sami Perez and drummer Tabor Allen. The band's sound has transitioned from lo-fi, garage-rock in their debut release Haxel Princess in 2014, to a more polished rock sound, with elements of grunge, punk and new wave, in their subsequent releases Apocalipstick and Stuffed & Ready. History Formation and early years (2012-2016) Cherry Glazerr originated as 'Clembutt': a solo project for then-15 year old vocalist and guitarist Clementine Creevy, who wrote, performed and uploaded a small catalogue of songs onto SoundCloud in 2012. The tracks were discovered by Burger Records co-founder Sean Bohrman, who released them as a tape titled Papa Cremp in 2013. In 2013 Creevy was joined by her high school friends Hannah Uribe and Sophia Muller, on drums and vocals respectively, and Sean Redman on bass. The band takes its name from NPR reporter Chery Glaser. Cherry Glazerr began performing with a number of prominent bands and festival scenes in 2013, including SXSW, Beach Goth, at the El Rey with Mikal Cronin and Redd Kross, and alongside Fidlar at Burger Records' annual Burgerama festival, where they captured the attention of fashion icon Hedi Slimane. In 2014, the band, now a trio following the departure of vocalist Sophia Muller, released their full-length debut Haxel Princess on Burger Records, featuring percussion by Joel Jerome. The album, described as \\"concocted from a mix of attitude, silliness and garage-born guitar haze\\" was praised for Creevy's unique vocals - alternating from dreamy to high-pitched, hostile and unforgiving  and for its cynical, witty lyrics. Apocalipstick and Stuffed & Ready (2017-present) Cherry Glazerr released their sophomore album, Apocalipstick, on January 20, 2017. The band's first album for Secretly Canadian was recorded at Hollywood's Sunset Sound studio in early 2016 with producers Joe Chicarrelli (The Strokes, The White Stripes) and Carlos De La Garza (Paramore), and explores themes of female empowerment, individuality, sexuality and consumerism. Apocalipstick was released to overall critical approval: it was described by Pitchfork as the band's \\"fiercest recording yet, full of shredding jams, furious howls, and self-aware swagger', and its lead single 'I Told You I'd Be With The Guys' as a \\"tremendous indie rock tune powerful enough to restore your faith in the genre' by The Guardian. Cherry Glazerr toured extensively across Europe and North America throughout 2017, supporting Foster the People and Slowdive on their North American tours, and playing a number of festivals, including FYF Fest, Pitchfork Fest and La Route du Rock. In 2018, Cherry Glazerr played at Coachella, opened for Portugal. The Man and The Breeders, and released a new single, \\"Juicy Socks\\". In November 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced their new album Stuffed & Ready would be released on February 1, 2019. They released a new single, \\"Daddi\\", with the announcement, accompanied by an animated music video directed by Danny Cole. Their new song, Wasted Nun from the album Stuffed & Ready along with a NSFW music video for the song was released on 1/11/19 Side projects Music by Cherry Glazerr has been featured on a number of artistic platforms. After recruiting vocalist Clementine Creevy to model for the Yves Saint Laurent Campaign in 2013, creative director Hedi Slimane commissioned Cherry Glazerr to write a song for his Fall 2014 Saint Laurent's women's show (\\"Had Ten Dollaz\\"). In 2014, Cherry Glazerr recorded a new version of the Al Dubin and Joe Burke (composer) song ‚ÄúTiptoe Through The Tulips‚Äù, which was featured in the 2015 supernatural horror film Insidious: Chapter 3. Creevy also supplied guest vocals for the Death Grips song \\"Giving Bad People Good Ideas\\", on the album Bottomless Pit. Frontwoman Clementine Creevy has acted in the Amazon Prime TV series Transparent, fronting the fictional rock band Glitterish. In 2017, VICE magazine produced a short autobiographical documentary about Creevy titled \\"Clementine Creevy: The Millenial [sic] Punk Feminist Icon\\". In 2020, the band was featured in a music video for the song \\"The End of The Game\\" by the American rock band Weezer, although they were not featured in the song. Clementine is featured on Tyler, The Creator's album \\"Cherry Bomb\\", on the song \\"Okaga, CA\\" Members The band has undergone a number of lineup changes since its inception. In 2015, Hannah Uribe left the band in pursuit of other artistic projects. In 2015, Cherry Glazerr saw the addition of two new musicians: multi-instrumentalist Sasami Ashworth on synths, who was invited to join the band by Sean Redman, and drummer Tabor Allen, who was subsequently invited to join the band by Ashworth. In mid-2016, and after participating in the recording of Apocalipstick, Redman departed and became a full-time member of his other band The Buttertones. He was replaced by bassist Devin O'Brien in 2017. In January 2018, Cherry Glazerr announced that Sasami Ashworth had left the band in order to concentrate on her own musical projects. On the subject of the band's change in personnel, Clementine Creevy described Cherry Glazerr as \\"a band that I lead, that has had a lot of beautiful additions to it and a lot of people have played in it.

It stands on the south side of the green in the middle of the village as it has done for 860 years.  Dedication  The church is dedicated to St Nicholas, Bishop of Myra (now Demre in modern Turkey) in the 4th century; a signatory of the Nicene Creed; patron saint of Russia and Greece, and of children, merchants, pawnbrokers, sailors, scholars and travellers.  Ministry  St Nicholas is part of the Mardyke Team Ministry.  Construction  The walls are of flint and stone rubble; the dressings are of Reigate stone. Although the two top storeys are 19th century, the four storied round tower was built onto the existing 12th century structure in the mid 13th century. Almost all of the church was rebuilt late in the 15th century when the north aisle and chapel were added and a 12th century doorway was reset in the north wall of the aisle. In 1744 the western part of the tower collapsed and was rebuilt. The chancel and north chapel, were extensively restored in 1866.  The Round Tower  St Nicholas is one of only six Essex Round Tower Churches. In 1552 the tower contained four bells but they were destroyed by lightning which struck the church and demolished the tower‚Äôs thatched spire in 1652/3. Richard Mulford, the Sexton donated a bell to replace the four bells, this bell was cast by John and Christopher Hodson of London in 1678. The present bell was installed in 1865, donated by Richard Armstrong of Westbourne Park Villas, London and cast by the famous Whitechapel Bell Foundry in London.  The Porch & North Doorway  The 12th-century north doorway was moved out and reset in its present position in the 15th century, surrounded by a 19th-century porch. The Norman doorway has three orders and the middle columns have spiral fluting and shaft ring enrichments. The capitals are carved with volutes and foliage; the arches are also decorated lavishly with chevrons and billets.  The Lady Chapel and Saltonstall Memorial  Interred in this chapel is Sir Richard Saltonstall (1521-1601), Lord of the Manor, patron of the church and Lord Mayor of London in 1597. There is a fine Elizabethan monument to Sir Richard erected by his wife Susannah, located on the north wall of the chapel. The monument is built of variegated marble. Between the columns are two arches forming alcoves for the principal figures of Sir Richard and his wife. Sir Richard can be seen wearing the insignia of the Lord Mayor of London. In the plinth are the figures of their sixteen children.

It flows northwest through a canyon into Ambrose Valley, past the Ash Creek Campground, then crosses into Modoc County and enters Round Valley where it turns southwest. At Adin, the creek is crossed by Highway 299 after passing through a gap in the hills into the much larger Big Valley, where it flows west roughly along the Modoc-Lassen county line. Near its terminus the creek feeds an extensive wetlands area known as Big Swamp, part of the Ash Creek State Wildlife Area. The creek joins with the Pit River on the western end of the swamp, about north of Bieber. Although located in a semi-desert region the flow of Ash Creek is perennial.
