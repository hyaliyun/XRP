Hodges (Ohio), which was consolidated with three other same- sex marriage cases from the other states in the Sixth Circuit: Tanco v. Haslam (Tennessee), DeBoer v. Snyder (Michigan), Bourke v. Beshear (Kentucky). On June 26, 2015 the Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit's decision, paving the way for same-sex marriage to become legal in those states, and setting a precedent for the entire nation. All four states complied with the ruling the same day it was issued before the mandate was actually issued. Every state in the circuit had a district court ruling against their states' ban, but they were eventually stayed pending appeal. The Sixth Circuit consists of Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. On August 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit heard oral arguments for same-sex marriage cases from each state within the circuit. On November 6, 2014, the Sixth Circuit in a split 2-1 decision, upheld the states' same-sex marriage bans, reversing the district courts' rulings that struck them down. The Sixth Circuit was the first and only circuit court since the landmark ruling United States v. Windsor to uphold the constitutionality of states' same-sex marriage bans which caused a circuit split. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell, same-sex marriages were neither performed nor recognized in Kentucky (with the exception of a divorce that was granted to a same-sex couple). However, recognition of out-of-state same-sex marriage was technically legal for a brief amount of time when a federal judge overturned part of the state's ban on same-sex marriage. This ruling was stayed the following day. Recognition of same-sex relationships (marriages under that name or any other) have been banned by the state constitution since 2004. The state's ban was struck down entirely on 1 July 2014 and was stayed pending appeal.https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/federal-judge-strikes- down-kentucky-same-sex-marriage-ban Michigan's state constitution bans recognition of same-sex unions in any form following a 2004 popular vote.

More than 300 same-sex couples were married in Michigan on Saturday, March 22, 2014, but a stay against enforcement of the ruling was issued late that same day until March 26. On March 25, 2014, a federal appeals court stayed the ruling indefinitely. The same-sex marriages that were performed that day are currently recognized.

Life Louis-Jacques Laval was born 6 January 6, 1807, in the small hamlet of Joimpy, Saint-L√©ger-des-Aub√©es in Eure-et-Loir. He was professed in the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (Picpus) December 30, 1825, under the name of Brother Honore and was ordained priest in Rouen in 1831.Mark, Andr√©. \\"La mission aux √éles Gambier\\" The Gambier Islands French Polynesia(Tahiti center left, with Gambiers to the southeast) Accompanied by Fathers Fran√ßois Caret, Chrysostome Liausu, and Brother Columba Murphy, he travelled by coach from Paris via Tours and Poitiers to Bordeaux, where they boarded the Sylphide, which sailed on 1 February 1834 for Valpara√≠so, arriving on 13 May. Taking passage on Captain Sweetwood's ship, the Peruvian, out of Boston, Caret and Laval arrived 8 August on Akamaru in the Gambier Islands. From the 10th to the 15th centuries, the Gambiers hosted a population of several thousand people and traded with other island groups including the Marquesas, the Society Islands and Pitcairn Islands. However, excessive logging by the islanders resulted in almost complete deforestation on Mangareva, with disastrous results for the islands' environment and economy. The folklore of the islands records a slide into civil war and even cannibalism as trade links with the outside world broke down, and archaeological studies have confirmed this tragic story. When Laval and Caret arrived the population of the Gambiers was estimated at 800 to 1,000.Wiltgen, Ralph M., \\"The Picpus Missionaries Reach the Gambier Islands\\", The Founding of the Roman Catholic Church in Oceania, 1825 to 1850, Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010 Karl Rensch says they counted 2,124 souls.Rencsh, Karl. \\"Early European Influence on the languages of Polynesia: The Gambier Islands\\", Language Contact and Change in the Austronesian World, (Tom Dutton and Darrell T. Tryon, eds.), p. 484, Walter de Gruyter, 1994 The Gambiers were fairly isolated. Captain Arnaud Mauruc advised the Apostolic Prefect of Southern Oceania, Chrysostome Liausu, that ships only sailed there every five or seven years for pearl fishing as the area had no other commercial value. Liausu remained in Valparaiso to maintain communications between the scattered missions and the Congregation in France. He died there in September 1839, having contracted typhus. In August 1834 Caret and Laval arrived on Akamaru and found shelter with a French fisherman. King Maputeoa's uncle, Matua, helped them learn the Mangareva language. Maputeoa himself was converted and baptized in August 1836, perhaps under a suspicion that his uncle may have been planning to usurp the throne. Maputeoa took the name \\"Gregory\\" in honor of the Pope at that time. Lal, Brij V. and Fortune, Kate. \\"Honor√© Laval\\", The Pacific Islands: An Encyclopedia, Vol. 1, University of Hawaii Press, 2000 The mission thrived. The maraes, (sacred places) were destroyed and shrines erected in the sites. The largely unclothed people were given clothing and cloth. On Caret's return from Europe in December 1838 2,157 items of clothing donated by the ladies of France were distributed. The London Missionary Society, which had been based in Tahiti for thirty years, had established schools in the Gambiers, but subsequently withdrew from the Gambiers in early 1835. Bishop √âtienne J√©r√¥me Rouchouze, Laval's immediate superior, arrived in the Gambiers in May 1835, with two lay brothers, Brother Gilbert Souli√© and Fabien Costes; a lay missionary, and two priests who were also medical doctors. During an epidemic that year Father Cyprien Liausu set up a hospital in a former temple at Rikitea. Cath√©drale Saint-Michel de Rikitea Lay brothers Costes and Soulie trained the local people in the building trades. They gained experience in the construction of chapels and houses. Together they built St. Michael's Cathedral, Rikitea. In 1856 Soulie and sixty workers travelled to Tahiti to work on Notre Dame Cathedral in Papeete. Ten years later, skilled Mangareva workers constructed the beacon at Point Venus in Tahiti.Hode√©, Paul. \\"Catholic Influence in the Islands\\", Tahiti 1834-1984 Caret and Laval hoped to expand their work to Tahiti, where they arrived in the Kingdom of Tahiti in February 1836. They found a place to stay in a house on the property of the American consul M. Moerenhout, a Belgian by birth, whom the British considered to be in the pay of King Louis Philippe I of France. Although the priests were received courteously at court, they were expelled by the Protestant queen P≈çmare IV on advice of British missionary (and soon to be consul) George Pritchard. Also expelled was a civilian French carpenter, named Vincent, who had accompanied the priests from Gambiers. These expulsions are the origin of the French intervention in Polynesia. As a result, in 1838 France sent Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars to get reparation. Shortly before the Admiral's arrival, Madame Moerenhout was murdered during a robbery, which the French believed was instigated by the British.Scott, L., \\"French Aggressions in the Pacific\\", The Foreign Quarterly Review, Vol. 34, 1844 Once his mission had been completed, Admiral DupetitThouars sailed towards the Marquesas Islands, which he annexed in 1842. Caret and Laval then returned to the Gambiers. Caret returned to France in 1837 in search of additional resources; Bishop Rouchouze left for Europe in 1841. On his return in 1843, Rouchouze, 7 priests, seven lay brothers and 10 religious perished when their ship, the Marie-Joseph was lost at sea near the Falklands. Cyprien Liausu became superior of the mission of Our Lady of Peace in the Gambiers, where he remained until 1855. In 1848, Bishop Jaussen, sent Laval to the Tuamotu Archipelago, where he remained for three years. He returned to the Gambiers in 1851. Political conflicts Blackbirders King Maputeoa died in 1857, and Queen Maria Eutokia became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son Joseph Gregorio II. Slave ships began to appear starting in 1862. In a practice known as blackbirding, Peruvian and Chilean ships combed the smaller islands of Polynesia seeking workers to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru. The Serpiente Marina out of Lima, anchored off Mangareva Island on 28 October, ostensibly on a scientific voyage. When local beachcomber-trader Jacques Guilloux went aboard and notice certain peculiarities such as iron grilles on the hatches and concealed daggers on the Captain and supercargo, he told Father Laval that he thought the ship was a slaver, and Laval advised the Queen. When the captain and two others paid a visit to the Queen, she had them arrested. Fearing repercussions from the French authorities in Tahiti, Laval had them released and ordered them to leave the Gambiers. Captain Martinez advised Laval that he intended to file a formal complaint against Guillous, Laval, and the Queen with the French authorities in Peru.Maude, H. E. (1981). Slavers in Paradise. Fiji: Institute of Pacific Studies Nonetheless, the exodus of young men on transient ships further reduced the population. Pearl traders Traders were also attracted to the islands in search of mother of pearl. By 1838 they are complaining that with the presence of the missionaries, they are no longer able to exchange useless items for pearls. As the missionaries made the people aware of the value of their nacre, the Mangarevans monitored more closely the operations in their lagoon. Increased contact with the outside brought exposure to infectious disease. The islands began to be slowly depopulated by pulmonary illnesses, smallpox, and dysentery.Scarr, Deryck. A History of the Pacific Islands, Routledge, 2013 An 1871 census by a French army doctor listed the population as 936. Pignon-Dupuy incident A conflict arose between a French businessman, Jean Pignon, and the Mangareva local court. Pignon, a former sailor, moved to Mangareva to trade in nacre. His nephew, Jean Dupuy, joined him in 1858. Dupuy refused to sign the recognition of local laws, and was subsequently convicted of adultery and theft. Sentenced to fifteen months, he served two and returned to Valparaiso. Pignon, who was heavily in debt in Tahiti, began to have difficulties with his landlord in Mangareva. The Mangareva Joint Council authorized the landlord to evict Pignon, and after re-locating his goods, demolish his hut. Pignon complained to M. Ronci√®re, Governor in Tahiti since 1864, who imposed a fine of 160,000 francs on the Regent Maria-Eutokia Toaputeitou, for having ruined Pignon by expropriating and demolishing the hut. The governor then installed the anti- clerical Caillet and twenty soldiers in the Gambiers to collect the fine. Garrett describes the conflict between Laval and the French troops as \\"a duel between barracks behavior and conventual customs\\". Governor Ronci√®re told Laval, \\"Your population is too religious; your people are stupid.\\" The dispute became an excuse to enhance French power in the archipelago and limit the influence of Laval and the mission. Peace was restored when, at the suggestion of Admiral Rigault de Genouilly, Bishop Florentin-√âtienne Jaussen, Apostolic Vicar of Tahiti offered to pay the fine on condition that the soldiers be withdrawn. Jaussen negotiated the amount with Ronci√®re, who agreed to accept 4,300 francs, which \\"curiously corresponded exactly to the amount that Pignon owed creditors Daniel Guilloux and Augustin Rapamoa. The Protectorate As early as 1842 Laval protested French occupation of the Marquesas. As Queen Maria Eutokia's chief advisor, he fought to preserve Mangarevan autonomy against colonists. In early 1870, Arone Teikatoara, the penultimate Prince Regent of Mangareva, asks the French government to end the protectorate, (which, due to a change in policy, had never received formal approval by the French government). The government attributed the request to the influence of Laval, who was viewed as \\"isolated from the world for thirty-six years and carried away by exaggerated religious ideas\\". French officials sought his removal. Following the visit of the Commander-Motte Rouge in February 1871 and upon the intervention of Admiral Lapelin, in March 1871, in order to appease Paris and \\"still this storm\\", Bishop Jaussen transferred Laval to Papeete, Tahiti and named him his pro-vicar, later making him Vice Provincial. Final years and death Around the 1870s, Laval collobrated with Father Tiripone Mama Taira Putairi, the first indigenous Mangarevan ordained a Catholic priest, to write a traditional history of Mangareva. The work titled E atoga no te ao eteni no Magareva (An Account of the Heathen Times of Mangareva) was deposited in the archives at the Congregation of the Sacred Heart at Braine- le-Comte, Belgium. Laval returned to the Gambier Islands, in July 1876, for one last time during a jubilee. His visit was the occasion of a great demonstration of esteem and gratitude. His last years were rather lonely, isolated by increasing deafness. \\"I can no longer preach, hear confessions anymore, nor enjoy the conversation of others.\\" Father Honor√© Laval died on 1 November 1880, and his body rests in the cemetery of the Catholic mission in Papeete. Character Laval did not have the diplomacy of Bishop Florentin- √âtienne Jaussen. Fr. Caret found him too \\"impatient\\" in their tour of Tahiti in 1836. Fr. Liausu regretted he seemed too severe. Laval was both paternalistic and very strict towards his flock, but equally zealous to protect them from exploitation, both economic and physical, on the part of the traders and sailors who came to frequent the area. A company could lose its contract for pearl-shell if a captain sailed off with a woman without first marrying her. According to John Garrett, \\"Laval incarnated the role of guardian, loved by many of the faithful, loathed by his irate opponents.\\"Garrett, John. To Live Among the Stars: Christian Origins in Oceania, World Council of Churches Legacy Laval lived in the Gambier Islands for almost forty years and compiled a detailed account of the indigenous peoples, including a grammar of the Mangarevan language, written between 1844 and 1846. He also recorded a local process for determining the solstice.Ruggles, Clive L. N., Ancient Astronomy, ABC-CLIO, 2005 \\"His grammar, dictionary, and description of Mangareva's pre-Christian culture reveal a classically trained observer affectionately at work.\\" Laval is recognized as a noted ethnologist for his work in recording the Mangarevan customs and practices. However, at the same time he was documenting their culture the missionaries were drastically changing it. The Picpus priests not only introduced a new religion, but European crops, and trained the people in new trades such as carpentry, masonry, and weaving. The first use of the name of Rapa Nui is in an 1863 letter of Father Laval.Fischer, Steven Roger. \\"The Naming of Rapanui\\", Easter Island Studies: Contributions to the History of Rapanui in memory of William T. Mulloy, (Oxford: Oxbow, 1993) Laval's life was fictionalized in the 1948 novel The Witch of Manga Reva by Garland Roark. Works * M√©moires pour servir √† l'histoire de Mangareva, √®re chr√©tienne, 1834-1871 * Mangareva : l'histoire ancienne d'un peuple polyn√©sien * Essai de grammaire Mangarevienne Controversy In 1870 an article was published in the Pall Mall Gazette severely criticizing Laval and his fellow priests working in the Gambiers and Tahiti. The story was picked up by other papers, including the Wellington Independent, which on 10 May 1870 ran a story under the title Theocracy in the Pacific. The original account was apparently based on an 1869 pamphlet written by a French former judge in Tahiti, one M. Louis Jacolliot, in defense of the former Governor Count de la Ronciere, who had been accused of abuse of his authority. The pamphlet \\"La verit√© sur Tahiti\\" (The Truth about Tahiti), accused Laval, among other things, of being a poisoner and a murderer.\\"Father Honore Laval and His Fellow-Laborers in the Pacific\\", Wellington Independent, Volume XXVII, Issue 3692, 31 December 1872, p. 3 It also apparently made various accusations against Queen Maria Eutokia of Mangareva. On 31 December 1872, the Independent published a letter referencing a story in the Parisian newspaper Le Figaro reporting that Laval had taken the matter to the Supreme Court of the State of the Protectorate of the Society Islands. The court found Jacolliot guilty of defamation,Messenger of Tahiti 18 May 1872 and ordered him to pay 15,000 francs in damages. It ordered the suppression of those portions of the pamphlet deemed defamatory, and further ordered that the judgement be printed in the official journal of the Protectorate in French, English, and Tahitian, as well as, in three newspapers of the French colonies, three journals of Paris, and four gazettes of provinces of Laval's choosing. Among the accusations levelled by Jacolliot against Laval were: *that the priests of the Gambiers held a monopoly of the nacre trade and forced the local people to work for them. However, Jean Paul Chopard, in his rebuttal, produced statements from five respected traders who had worked the area for twenty-five years, declaring that they had never observed any of the missionaries engaged in trade. Chopard, Jean Paul. Les Iles Gambier et la brochure de M. L. Jacolliot, Brest,France: J.B. Lefournier Ain√©, 1871 *that anonymous sources had informed him that Laval had poisoned, (among others), the young King Gregorio, although the king had in fact died of phthisis after a long illness. *that the Mangarevans wanted a French warship to come and remove Laval, but Chopard presented a document signed by fifteen residents to the contrary. *that Laval refused to allow shipwrecked Chilean sailors to land, thus forcing them to spend another twenty days at sea in a boat to get to Tahiti. According to Chopard's account, this was Captain W. Clark's Gleaner, which wrecked off Akamaru on the evening of 18 April 1859. The people of the island managed to rescue the crew, passengers, much of their effects, and attempted to right the vessel. Laval offered them the hospitality of the rectory and the sacramental wine for their fatigue. They returned to Tahiti aboard the Queen's schooner Marie-Louise. Louis Jacolliot Jacolliot was a French barrister, colonial judge, prolific author and lecturer with an interest in occultism, who lived for several years in Tahiti and India during the period 1865-1869. He believed that the account in the Gospels is a myth based on the mythology of ancient India. His writings on the \\"Indian roots of western occultism\\" make reference to an otherwise unknown Sanskrit text he called Agrouchada-Parikchai, which is apparently Jacolliot's personal invention, a \\"pastiche\\" of elements taken from Upanishads, Dharmashastras and \\"a bit of Freemasonry\\".Introduction to Occult Science in India by Louis Jacolliot [1919] at sacred-texts.com by J. B. Hare, June 21, 2008. Jacolliot also believed in a lost Pacific continent, and was quoted on this by Madame Blavatsky. References Further reading * Gillespie, Rosemary G. Clague, D.

After an extensive search throughout the city, dubbed by the press as \\"the largest search in South Jersey\\", her dead body was discovered by her playmate in the closet of a vacant house near her home on March 3. The dog bounded out of the closet, seemingly unharmed. Despite the initial suspicion of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; a case of starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box. Birth and siblings Mary Jane Barker was born in Bellmawr, New Jersey, U.S., on February 28, 1953, to Mr. and Mrs. Frank Barker. She had two older siblings: Carol Ann, 8 years older; and Frank Jr., 6 years older. Disappearance Barker disappeared along with a four-month old black spaniel puppy at 10:30 a.m. on Monday, February 25, 1957, in Bellmawr. She was last seen playing in a nearby yard, going to meet with her friend and neighbor, 6-year-old Maria Freitta, the owner of the dog. Police were notified by 1:30 p.m. She was presumed kidnapped, and the next day footprints were found along a nearby stream bank which seemed those of a man, child, and dog. The police stated that the small footprints on the mud matched the size of Barker's shoes. Search Her disappearance \\"touched off an intensive search for a kidnapper or murderer\\" according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. It was called \\"the largest search in South Jersey.\\" Hundreds of volunteers and police searched the city. On the first night more than 200 civilians did a foot-by- foot search. Eventually well over a thousand people were involved. Her fourth birthday came and went with no sign of her. On Wednesday, February 27, the parents made an appeal on television to anyone who may have kidnapped Barker, asking them to \\"leave the child in the nearest church.\\" Vern Lovering, a 43-year old floor sander and convicted child molester had been questioned, and said he was near the Barker home. On Thursday, February 28, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted its own search, and the next day again questioned Lovering after police received a phone call demanding $500 ransom. Police made an appeal to the kidnapper not to \\"act in haste or do harm to the child.\\" The grief of the Barker family was especially acute on February 28 and March 1 since those were the birthdays of Barker and her father, and they were planning to have a joint celebration that week. The police stated that they were working on several leads but had no developments. On Saturday, March 2, the FBI was officially called in following the provisions of the Federal Kidnapping Act. Several nearby dumps were searched to no avail. Discovery of body On Sunday, March 3, Maria Freitta, the owner of the dog and the playmate of Barker, went with her mother to a vacant, newly built ranch house next door to her home. It was on 433 2nd Ave, owned by her aunt and uncle, Mr. and Mrs. Pat Vecchia. Maria managed to open a 3 ft √ó 5 ft bedroom closet's door, and her missing dog bounded out of the closet and leaped happily at her. Also in the closet was Barker, dead, in a seated position, the hood of her blue coat partially covering her blonde hair. She was found in the same clothes she had on when she disappeared. Bits of fur from her hat were rubbed off. Police Chief Edward Garrity stated he believed that Barker had recently been placed in the closet as the puppy had been fed recently, and there was no animal waste in the closet despite the dog not being housebroken. During previous searches, including a visit by a repairman, no dog was heard. The house had been searched three times before, but the bedroom closet where her body was found was not searched. Rev. Harry McIntyre looked in bedroom closets on February 26, but it never occurred to him to search the front-bedroom closet. \\"I concentrated on the basement, believing the girl might have fallen down the stairs,\\" he said. A volunteer fireman, John Reeves, also searched the first-floor bedroom but not the closet. Barker may have been too frightened to cry out. The lock on the closet door. Although the door was unlocked, a thumb screw inside apparently made it difficult for a child to open. The door had a knob on the outside, but only a small turn latch on the inside. Autopsy and conspiracy theories On March 4, the autopsy indicated Barker had nothing in her system since some chocolate milk the morning of her disappearance, and had not eaten since she vanished. There was no indication of foul play; no signs of violence or sexual molestation. It was found she must have lived in the closet for three days without food or drink. An inspection of the closet showed marks from her attempt to escape. It was found the dog was with her the whole time. The dog was \\"alive and frisky\\", which initially led investigators to believe she had been in the closet only a short time. The dog was first taken to a local veterinarians for study, but they concluded that it was possible that the dog had to be put down to examine his stomach contents. Dr. Robert Sauer, the veterinarian, stated that the survival of the dog for several days was consistent with the stamina of such an animal. On March 4, the dog was euthanized in order to allow veterinarians from the University of Pennsylvania to examine its stomach contents, and establish why the dog outlived Barker. Investigators wanted to know if the dog was without food or water since Barker's disappearance. Camden County Coroner Robert J. Blake ruled her death an accident; a case of starvation with exposure as a contributing factor. A spokesman for the coroner said Barker became trapped in the closet, and died of fright and starvation. Due to a hole in the closet, she could not have suffocated. Aftermath On March 7, Mayor Cornelius Devennel ordered all closet doors to be equipped with special knobs that could be opened easily from both inside and outside. This order was made mandatory for all new home constructions or reconstructions. A ceremony in her memory was held at the St. Francis de Sales Church that same day. On March 20, radio station WPEN presented Freitta with a new puppy, an English Setter. Boy in the Box The press surrounding the Barker case led to the first calls about the Boy in the Box. Frank Guthrum, who discovered the boy, had decided not to call the police until he listened to reports of the Barker case on his car radio.

The battery has been largely destroyed, but some remains can still be seen. History Qalet Marku Battery was built in 1715‚Äì1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the battery were Saint Mark's Tower to the north, Qalet Marku Redoubt to the west (now demolished) and Baƒßar iƒã-ƒäagƒßaq Redoubt to the east. Construction of the battery cost 1165 scudi. Foundations of Qalet Marku Battery with Saint Mark's Tower in the distance The battery originally consisted of a pentagonal gun platform with an embrasured parapet wall. A rectangular blockhouse was located in the centre of the battery, while the entire structure was surrounded by a rock-hewn ditch. The battery was still in good condition until the first half of the 20th century. It seems to have been severely damaged before or during World War II. At this point, a concrete bunker was built on one side of the ruined battery. Present day Today, only the ditch and part of the scarp wall are still visible, although they are covered in vegetation. Despite this, the site is considered to have significant archaeological potential if properly excavated and studied.

He was born in Lviv circa 1575 into a family with German ancestry and he died sometime around 1630, possibly in the same town. He is one of Poland‚Äôs most respected graphic artists of the period. Not much is known about his early life and artistic formation; although in 1596‚Äì7 he appears as a member of the Brotherhood of Catholic Painters in Lviv. After training in his native country, he travelled through Italy and Germany to France in about 1598. Ada Palka has suggested that Ziarnko may have come into contact with artists involved in painting anamorphic scenes at this time.Ada Palka, ‚ÄòJan Ziarnko‚Äôs Anamorphic Print A Pair of Lovers Embracing‚Äô, in Print Quarterly XXXII, no. 2 (March, 2015), pp. 3‚Äì13. The Death of Ravaillac Ziarnko spent most of his adult years in Paris, between 1605 and 1629, where the vast majority of his known works were created. These comprise around thirty-five individual prints as well as three extensive print series. Around seventy-five prints made after drawings by Ziarnko also exist.J. Telibska, Grafika XVII wieku w Polsce, Funkcje, o≈õrodki, arty≈õci, dzie≈Ça (Warsaw, 2011), p. 45. He designed bookplates and images for wall almanacs in addition to depicting aerial views and portraits, as well as historical and contemporary events. One of his more unusual works is a folding anamorphic etching of 1608. When folded into a cone, this reveals an image of two lovers embracing. This derives from Marcantonio Raimondi‚Äôs Modi, a collection of erotic prints that illustrate various sexual positions. The Latin inscription and several vignettes which surround it are also taken from another source in the form of Matth√§us Greuter‚Äôs The Power of Venus of 1587. However, Ziarnko‚Äôs use of a circular grid to create a deformation mesh which produces the anamorphic distortion appears to be highly novel. Ziarnko‚Äôs expertise in perspective is attested to by his treatise of 1619, Perspectivae Stereo Pars Specialis (Three-dimensional Pictorial Perspective, Special Part). This outlines methods for constructing anamorphic images. As such, it played an important role in shaping later literature on the subject, such as Jean-Fran√ßois Niceron‚Äôs La Perspective Curieuse of 1638, which was voluminous in seventeenth-century France. Examples of Ziarnko‚Äôs work can now be seen in the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France in Paris, the British Museum in London, the Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w, and The National Library of Poland in Warsaw (digital version here).

In 1812 he obtained the gold Isis medal from the Society of Arts for modelling. He was a draughtsman, and also tried painting; ambidextrous, he drew and modelled with either hand. Pitts gained a reputation for models and reliefs in neo-classical taste. A versatile artist, he made designs for plates and other domestic items. He also worked for Rundell & Bridge as a chaser. He ran into business and financial troubles, and committed suicide on 16 April 1840 by taking laudanum at his residence, 5 Watkins Terrace, Pimlico. Works Pitts chased a portion of the \\"Wellington Shield\\" designed by Thomas Stothard for Green & Ward, and the whole of the \\"Shield of Achilles\\" designed by John Flaxman for Rundell & Bridge. In later life he modelled, in imitation of those, a \\"Shield of √Üneas\\" and \\"Shield of Hercules\\" from Hesiod only a portion of the former was carried out in silver. Pitts had a very prolific imagination, and In 1830 he executed the bas-reliefs in the bow-room and drawing-rooms at Buckingham Palace. He exhibited models at the Royal Academy, and made two designs for the Nelson monument. He executed for publication a series of outline illustrations to the works of Virgil, of which two numbers were published, and also a series of illustrations to Ossian, of which two were engraved in mezzotint, but never published. He made similar drawings to illustrate Horace and the Bacch√¶ and Ion of Euripides.

As of December 2015, Sidekick is deployed at the International Space Station. Functionality Sidekick has two modes of operation. Remote Expert Mode uses the functionality of the Holographic Skype application‚Äîvoice and video chat, real-time virtual annotation‚Äîto allow a ground operator and space crew member to collaborate directly over what the astronaut sees, with the ground operator able to see the crew member's view in 3D, provide interactive guidance, and draw annotations into the crew member's environment. In Procedure Mode, animated virtual illustrations display on top of objects as a crew member interacts with them. This mode can be used for guidance and instructional purposes in standalone scenarios. Applications include inventory management, in which the system recognizes an inventory item, and can display a path to where the item should be stored. Previously, crew members would rely primarily on printed instructions and voice-based communication when performing complex tasks. The capabilities provided by Sidekick have been promoted as potential enabling features allowing for reduced crew training requirements and increased efficiency in deep space missions in which communication delays can complicate difficult operations. History After having performed simulated reduced-gravity testing in its Weightless Wonder C9 aircraft, NASA attempted to launch a pair of HoloLens units aboard the SpaceX CRS-7 launch to the International Space Station on June 28, 2015, but the Falcon 9 rocket carrying the payload exploded at 2 minutes and 19 seconds into the flight. Sidekick was tested at the Aquarius laboratory from late July to early August 2015 as part of the two-week long NASA Extreme Environment Missions Operations 20 expedition, demonstrating its operation in tasks such as equipment checks and setup.

Hogan and written by Irving Reis, Maxwell Shane and Robert Yost. The film stars John Howard, Gail Patrick, William Frawley, Jane Darwell, Porter Hall and Harvey Stephens. The film was released on June 23, 1939, by Paramount Pictures. Plot Newspaper reporter and amateur ham radio operator John Keefe, anxious for a scoop, plants a shortwave radio in the courtroom to eavesdrop on the grand jury's investigation into the brokerage house owned by Anthony Pelton and Thomas Reedy, which is allegedly dealing in fraudulent stocks. When the story breaks in the newspaper under John's byline, John's brother Michael, the assistant district attorney, is castigated by his boss. Nevertheless, John continues to jeopardize his brother's career and decides to infiltrate the brokerage house by posing as Avery, a wealthy young investor from the South. In a meeting at Pelton and Reedy's office, John leaves behind his briefcase, which has a microphone concealed in it. Soon afterward, Pelton, who has become squeamish over the grand jury investigation, decides to skip town. While emptying the safe, Pelton is accosted by a gun wielding young man, and in the ensuing skirmish, the gun discharges into John's briefcase. As the young man falls unconscious to the floor, Reedy enters and shoots Pelton. When the police arrive, the young man is charged with Pelton's murder and Mike is assigned to the case. Meanwhile, John, who has been fired for drunkenness, is told by his editor that he will be rehired if he uncovers the mystery killer. Posing as a priest, John visits the accused in prison, where the young man confesses that Pelton tried to blackmail his father. When Mike learns of his brother's duplicity, he orders his arrest, and John is brought before the grand jury to testify. For refusing to betray the young man's confidence, John is jailed for contempt. While in jail, John's friend brings him the briefcase, and when John sees the bullet hole, he realizes that the young man is innocent. Begging his brother for a chance to make amends, John is released and goes to Reedy's office, where he digs a bullet from the desk. At that moment, Reedy enters and orders John into his car at gunpoint. Using the radio hidden in his briefcase, John broadcasts his location in Morse code, and ham radio operators pick it up and radio for help. As the district attorney and grand jury listen in, a motorcade surrounds the car and Reedy shoots John. Reedy tries to escape, but is captured by the police, and John is taken to the hospital, where he is reinstated by the paper.

History The first presence of Sikhs to Iran began in the 1900, when both Sikh business people as well as Sikh troops in the British military during its occupation of Iran. The primary target of Sikh immigration was initially the hamlet of Zahedan, near the border with then British India (now Pakistan) during the 1920s when the Trans- Iranian Railway project was started. According to a folk etymology it is believed that when Reza Shah visited the city he saw Sikhs in white robes living there and thus changed the name from Dozdab (Land of thieves) to Zahedan (plural of the persian word (), meaning 'pious') after the Sikhs who were considered z√¢hid (Sages) by him. An Indian school was started in 1930s located in Zahedan serving Sikh families. It was shifted to Tehran in 1952 and became Kendriya Vidyalaya Tehran in 2004. In 1979 there were around 250 Sikhs in Zahedan who own motor parts distributorships, construction firms and import-export companies. After the Iranian Revolution a number Sikhs left for India and Europe and remaining shifted to the capital city of Tehran.

When he returned from Mexico to Portugal he was arrested by the police and handed over to the Spanish authorities, who executed him. Early years Isidoro Di√©guez Due√±as was born in Puertollano, Ciudad Real on 19 January 1909. In 1924 he joined the Union of Bricklayers in Madrid, and in 1932 became a member of the Spanish Communist Party (Partido Comunista Espa√±ol, PCE). He was named delegate for the Radio Sur union. In the Spanish Civil War he fought on the Somosierra and Guadarrama fronts, and in the headquarters in Monta√±a, Getafe and Cuatro Vientos. Di√©guez was head of the PCE's Provincial Committee of Madrid, became a member of the PCE central committee in 1937, and joined the Politburo in 1938. On 2 December 1936 the Madrid Defense Council was reorganized with General Jos√© Miaja as chairman. Di√©guez was Militias delegate in the junta. Other PCE members were Santiago Carrillo (Public Order) and Pablo Yag√ºe (Supplies). On 13 February 1937 Di√©guez demanded that \\"doubtful and suspect elements\\" be removed from the army, and a few days later the Communist leaders demanded the dismissal of Jos√© Asensio Torrado. Di√©guez was appointed to the Junta's War Council, ranked second after Antonio Mije Garc√≠a. Exile In March 1939 Segismundo Casado launched an anti-communist uprising in Madrid supported by the militant anarchist Cipriano Mera. Isidoro Di√©guez organized resistance to the revolt with other PCE members. After Casado succeeded, Di√©guez managed to escape to Valencia, where he took ship for France. There he contacted Francisco Ant√≥n Sanz and with the help of SERE left for America in August 1939. He sailed to New York City in August 1939, and reached Mexico in September 1939. Return and death In the spring of 1941 Di√©guez was charged with directing development of party policy in Spain. He sailed in the Portuguese ship Gaza under false papers, and landed in Lisbon in mid June. Other Spanish communists in Lisbon around that time were Jes√∫s Larra√±aga, Manuel Asarta and Eleuterio Lobo. Two South American activists were arrested in Madrid in September 1941, Eleuterio Lobo Mart√≠n (\\"Leandro\\") and Mari Ibarra (\\"Sionin\\"). This led to arrests in Vigo of Eladio Rodr√≠guez Gonz√°lez, Francisco Barreiro Barciela and others. This in turn led to the arrests of the Spanish communist group in Lisbon by the police of the Salazar regime. The group in Lisbon was arrested on September 1941 and handed over to the Spanish in October 1941. They were questioned in the Puerta del Sol, then imprisoned in Porlier prison in Madrid. On 19 January 1942 they were tried by a court martial, and six of the group were sentenced to death. Isidoro Di√©guez Due√±as was executed by firing squad against the wall of the East Cemetery in Madrid on the morning of 21 January 1942. He was aged 33.

Episodes Creator Anna Winger said that all of the episode names originated from NATO military exercises from 1983. Production The show was created by the husband and wife team of American novelist Anna Winger and German TV producer Joerg Winger, who pitched it as a trilogy. It is produced by Joerg Winger, Nico Hofmann, and Henriette Lippold. Anna Winger said that they did extensive research with experts who were from both sides of Germany. Historian Klaas Voss from the Hamburg Institute for Social Research was very important in providing historical information. Jonas Nay, who played Martin, said he received technical assistance from military adviser/NATO expert Steffen Meier. The show was shot in and around locations in Berlin, Germany. A suburb in east Berlin was used to portray period East Germany. For some scenes the Stasi headquarters () was used as a location and the production was able to film at the Stasi Museum, which is the actual site of the original headquarters. The actual headquarters for the HVA was however in Gosen about 28 km (17 miles) south east of the Berlin TV tower, less than 1 km (0.6 miles) SE of the Berlin city limits, and approximately 4.5 miles (7.5 km) south of the city of Erkner. The backup bunker for the headquarters of the HVA was also located there. Directors Edward Berger and Samira Radsi used the same crew‚Äîand often the same locations‚Äîto shoot their respective episodes. One director would prepare for shooting while the other was shooting. They worked in parallel like this throughout the filming of the show. Radsi said she knew producer Winger from working together on the popular German TV show, Leipzig Homicide. SundanceTV created a digital marketing strategy that reflected the use of locations in Germany that were meant to recreate both East and West Germany in the early 1980s. Reflecting both the intertitle of the show, the marketing team created sliders that show locations as they were in contrast to the current day. The opening credits were created by Saskia Marka. Music The show makes extensive use of 1980s popular music, including Nena's \\"99 Luftballons\\", David Bowie, New Order and Eurythmics among others. Each week's episode has a playlist of music from and/or inspired by the episodes. The score was created by Reinhold Heil, who produced the song \\"99 Luftballons.\\" Heil, who often collaborates with Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run), said that he was on board the project when he saw the first scene of the show, where two teenagers are being interrogated by the border guards (one of whom was Martin, the main character) for attempting to smuggle two books by Shakespeare and Marx across the border. He said that it was very realistic, which comes from his similar experience when he was caught smuggling music (Stravinsky and Bach). * Episode 1 ‚Äì \\"Quantum Jump\\": DJ Geespin of Power 105.1 * Episode 2 ‚Äì \\"Brave Guy\\": WFMU Station Manager Ken * Episode 3 ‚Äì \\"Atlantic Lion\\": DJ John Fell Ryan of the NYC band Excepter and the documentary Room 237 * Episode 4 ‚Äì \\"Northern Wedding\\": DJ Jonathan Tooubin of New York Night Train * Episode 5 ‚Äì \\"Cold Fire\\": DJ Takefive of C√úR Music * Episode 6 ‚Äì \\"Brandy Station\\": Top 10 Songs of 1983 According to Billboard * Episode 7 ‚Äì \\"Bold Guard\\": DJ David John Bishop * Episode 8 ‚Äì \\"Able Archer\\": Composer Reinhold Heil * Episode 8 ‚Äì \\"Able Archer\\" (finale bonus): Creator Anna Winger The theme for the respective English-subtitled North American and UK broadcasts of the series featured Peter Schilling's \\"Major Tom (Coming Home)\\" ‚Äì the English-language version of Schilling's big 1983 European hit \\"Major Tom (v√∂llig losgel√∂st)\\". However, the markedly different introductory sequence for the German broadcast of the series used New Order's 1983 hit \\"Blue Monday\\". Critical response Deutschland 83 was met with critical acclaim and received a 2015 Peabody Award. Rotten Tomatoes gives the show a 100% score with an average rating of 8.2/10, sampled from 22 reviews. The consensus states: \\"An engrossing drama with a fun '80s soundtrack, Deutschland 83 chronicles an intense spy story that brings viewers uncomfortably close to the Iron Curtain.\\" On Metacritic, it holds a score of 79 out of 100, based on reviews from 11 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The first two episodes of Deutschland 83 premiered at the Berlinale 2015 to very positive reviews. In its US television premiere, it also received positive reviews, with mention of its humor and successful depiction of a Cold War thriller, with favorable comparisons to the US show, The Americans. Many critics called it the best show of the summer of 2015. Writing in The New Yorker, Emily Nussbaum called the show a gorgeous, slinky thriller, praising its recreation of 1983 Germany as \\"nearly as aesthetically aspirational\\" as Mad Men. She questioned the plot line's credibility as Martin's character repeatedly landed, Zelig-like, \\"at the center of world-historical events\\", but didn't deem this to be a \\"deal- breaker\\". In a mixed review, The New York Times compared the series to shows on the network The CW, given that it focuses on a young adult struggling with being \\"the only glimmer of sanity in a world gone mad\\". Clemens Poellinger from the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet awarded the series a 5/6 rating. He praises the \\"excellence in time-faithful environment and details\\" but also points out the similarities with the series Weissensee. Philip Oltermann of The Guardian praised the idea of viewing the Cold War from an East German's perspective, but wrote that the show, instead of taking advantage of its \\"radical premise\\", \\"backtracks into stereotype\\" by portraying East German officers as \\"cruel ideologues\\", and the West German peace movement as \\"infiltrated not just by Soviet agents, but gay Soviet agents at that\\".  Awards  Deutschland 83 has received a number of international and domestic awards including an International Emmy Award, a Peabody Award, Grimme Prize, The Golden Nymph, a Metropolis Award, two C21 Drama Awards, a Golden Camera, the \\"Special Jury Award\\" of the Roma Fiction Fest, and Series Mania 2015 for Best World Series.  Broadcast  The series premiered in the United States on 17 June 2015, on SundanceTV, making it the first German-language series to air on a US network. The success of Deutschland 83 in the US and UK paved the way for another series also featuring a young Stasi agent dispatched to West Germany under an assumed identity, The Same Sky. In Germany, Deutschland 83 began to air after the U.S. run on RTL 26 November 2015. There, the series lost viewers over the course of its run; the series finale had 1.72 million viewers, or approximately half of the series premiere's viewers. As a result, German newspaper Bild called the show \\"the flop of the year\\". It premiered in Ireland on 29 November 2015, on RT√â2. All episodes were added to Australian streaming service Stan in December 2015. On 14 January 2016, the series was made available for streaming in The Netherlands via Videoland. It premiered on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2016, with the final two episodes shown back-to-back on 14 February. It has since become the most popular foreign-language drama in the history of British television with an audience of 2.5 million viewers as of January 2016. The series was aired for Iran, Afghanistan and Tajikistan by BBC Persian in October 2017.

For 'HLOS', see Network Rail > Control periods. Proposed railway electrification in Great Britain. Background In 2009, Lord Adonis was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. After a gap of more than a decade, electrification was back on the agenda and Adonis announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England. In July 2012 the UK government announced ¬£4.2 billion of new electrification schemes, all at 25 kV AC and reconfirmed schemes previously announced by Adonis. These were to be Northern Hub, Great Western Main Line, South Wales Main Line, Midland Main Line, Electric Spine, Crossrail, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and West Midlands suburban lines including the Cross-City Line. Rail transport in Scotland is a devolved matter for the Scottish Government, but they too have pursued electrification with multiple schemes in the Central Belt. All these have been 25 kV AC, as in England and Wales. On 25 June 2015 the government announced that some of the electrification projects would be delayed or cut back because of rising costs. Electrification work was to be \\"paused\\" on the Trans-Pennine route between York and Manchester and on the Midland main line between Bedford and Sheffield. Electrification of the Great Western main line would go ahead but the status of the Reading-Newbury and Didcot-Oxford sections was unclear. However, in September 2015, the electrification work was \\"un-paused\\", but with a delayed completion date. Since then there have been regular updates including one published in October 2016. On 20 July 2017 Chris Grayling the Secretary of State for Transport cancelled a number of electrification projects citing disruptive works and use of bi-mode technology as an alternative.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40669869 In June 2018, Electrification has not been without controversy with cancellations and various appearances of the Secretary of State for Transport called before the Transport Select Committee. The Transport Select Committee published its report into various matters including regional investment disparity on the railways and calling again for the reinstatement of various cancelled electrification schemes. A written question was submitted and answered in parliament regarding route miles electrified in the years 1997-2019. In March 2019 the Railway Industry Association published a paper on Electrification cost challenge suggesting ways forward and a rolling programme of electrification. List of routes Northern Hub As part of the Northern Hub project, the following lines in North West England and Yorkshire are to be electrified: * Liverpool to Manchester Northern Route: Manchester to Newton- le-Willows completed December 2013; to Liverpool, planned by December 2014 but completed in February 2015.North West Electrification, Network Rail. Accessed 16 July 2012 * Liverpool to Wigan: planned by December 2014 but completed in March 2015.Network Rail * Manchester to Preston (via Bolton) by December 2017 and Preston to Blackpool North by May 2018. An October 2017 update pushed back the completion of the Manchester - Preston section.https://www.greatermanchester- ca.go...d/2510/item_06_local_rail_service_performance This scheme provides an electrified route from Blackpool to the West Coast Main Line at Preston and then on to Manchester diverging from the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Jct. Originally, Preston - Blackpool was to be done before Manchester - Preston, but Network Rail said Preston - Blackpool needed to have new signalling and the opportunity was also taken to completely remodel Blackpool North and Kirkham & Wesham stations and other remodelling improvements at Salwick and Poulton-le-Fylde. The scheme was to have followed with a new completion date of March 2018. Further delays ensued and a powered electric train (a Virgin Pendolino) finally carried out multiple test runs overnight on 14‚Äì15 May 2018, a few days after energisation. Similarly, in the early hours of 13 December 2018, a Virgin Pendolino ran test runs between Preston and Manchester Piccadilly shortly after energisation. The full electric service from Manchester to Blackpool North started in February 2019 * to As a spin-off, in December 2013 it was announced that the branch from to would also be electrified by 2017. However, the enhancements delivery plan update of September 2016 moved the completion date with only GRIP Stage 3 (Option selection) being completed by then. * The North TransPennine route, comprising the Huddersfield Line between Manchester Victoria and via and : expected by 2022.  As an extension of this the Hull to Selby Line was going to follow: Hull Trains planned to electrify the line between Temple Hirst Junction on the East Coast Main Line south of and Hull using private finance. This moved closer to reality on 20 March 2014 when Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin confirmed in the House of Commons that he had made ¬£2.4m available to move the project to the next stage of development, GRIP Stage 3. This scheme was to have joined the already planned transpennine electrification (part of the Northern Hub project) at Selby. In November 2016 this project was shelved indefinitely.http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/anger-as-ministers-shelve- yorkshire-rail-electrification-plans-1-8242509https://www.bbc.com/news/uk- england-humber-38004362 Harrogate line Harrogate to Leeds electrification proposed, but not yet agreed.  Windermere branch line  * Windermere Branch Line: In August 2013, the Department for Transport announced that the branch line between and was to be electrified by 2016.\\"DfT Unveils Lakes Electrification Plans\\" Railnews news article 09-08-2013; Retrieved 2014-03-13 The Hendy review moved the completion of GRIP 3 to March 2017 with a yet to be determined date for completion of electrification. In July 2017 Chris Grayling the Secretary of State for Transport announced the scheme had been cancelled and bi-mode technology would be used. Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line *The electrification of the GWML to Thingley Junction (near Chippenham) and the SWML via Bristol Parkway to Cardiff Central was due for completion in December 2018, but was delayed to December 2019, with electric trains only beginning to run to Cardiff from January 2020. https://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/cardiff-electric-services-go- live/55486.article Electrification from Reading to Newbury was completed in December 2018. On 8 November 2016, Transport Minister Paul Maynard announced that several parts of the Great Western electrification project were being deferred 'until further notice': these include the line between Didcot and Oxford, the lines to (both via Bristol Parkway and Bath), the line between Cardiff and Swansea ,Rail electrification delayed but passengers told there will be new trains with more seats Oxford Times, 8 November 2016 and the Henley and Marlow branch lines. On 20 July 2017, it was announced that the Cardiff-Swansea electrification project had been cancelled and that bi-mode trains would be used on the route.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/policy/single-view/view/sheffield- swansea-and-windermere-electrification-cancelled.html *As a spin-off, it was proposed that the Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes would be electrified once the main route is complete.  Midland Main Line  Main article: Midland Main Linealt=Near FelmerhamthumbBridges over the Midland Main Line in Bedfordshire have been replaced to allow greater clearances for electrification and larger rolling stock. Before (top) and after (bottom) the 2014 upgrade. * Already electrified to Bedford. This was to be extended to Corby, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. In November 2016 only the electrification to Kettering and Corby was confirmed as continuing with the DfT refusing to be drawn on dates for the remaining parts of the original scheme.[45][46] On 20 July 2017, it was announced that the Kettering- Nottingham-Sheffield electrification project had been cancelled and that bi- mode trains would be used on the route.[24] * However, in March 2019, it was announced by Department for Transport that the line between Kettering and Market Harborough would be electrified.[47]  Electric Spine  Main article: Electric Spine * Electrification of the lines from the Port of Southampton to Nuneaton, and to the Midland Main Line via the East West Rail between Oxford and Bedford. This would have involved electrifying the Coventry to Nuneaton, and Coventry to Leamington Line, part of the Chiltern Main Line, Cherwell Valley Line and Reading to Basingstoke Line; also converting part of the South Western Main Line between Basingstoke and Southampton Central from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead.[45] As a large portion of the spine depends on electrification of the Midland Main Line and this has been cancelled north of Kettering and defunded for East West Rail, it may be assumed this scheme has also been put on hold indefinitely. Crossrail New cross-London main line, originally due to open in December 2018. Opening has been delayed until 2021. Gospel Oak to Barking Line * Electrification of this line which is part of London Overground was announced in July 2013. Major civil engineering with line closures started July 2016. Full in-service date was expected to be 30 June 2017. However, design errors and the late delivery of materials and structures meant that the project was delayed. The start of electric services was to be in May 2018. * Delays in the electrification of the line were followed by delays in the delivery of the Class 710 electric train sets. The first two trains entered service on 23 May 2019, with the full fleet entering service in August 2019. These 4-car train sets doubled the length of the trains and passenger capacity compared to the former 2-car Diesel train sets, completing the project.. West Midlands suburban lines Extensions to the existing West Midlands suburban electrification: *Cross-City Line electrification to be extended from to by 2017. Due to delays in the project, electric services started in July 2018. *Chase Line electrification to be extended from to by 2017.

Scotland =Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP)= This electrification scheme and associated works has come to mean Edinburgh-Glasgow via Falkirk High and was due to be completed by December 2016. The rolling programme would then follow with the route via Shotts. The scheme via Carstairs in association with the ECML electrification was completed in the early 1990s. With other infills in the central belt of Scotland there will soon be 4 different electrified routes between the two cities with assorted diversionary routes.http://www.transport.gov.scot/project/electrification-programme The December 2016 date was not met and in May 2017 a further delay to the wires going live was announced due to a safety-critical component possibly for the whole route needing to be replaced.http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-glasgow-rail- electrification-delayed-again-1-4449540 It was actually completed in December 2017. The infills include the route from Cumbernauld and Falkirk Grahamston to Larbert, Alloa, Dunblane and Stirling.  2020 onwards  Under Transport Secretary Chris Grayling many of the proposed electrification projects were cancelled, despite pledging to remove full diesel trains by 2040 . However after being sacked in 2019, and replaced by Grant Shapps many of the cancelled electrification schemes are being reconsidered. = Stalybridge to Leeds = = Hull to Selby and Sheffield = Now the electrification scheme could be back on the agenda after transport secretary Grant Shapps confirmed plans to spend nearly ¬£600m on work to upgrade and electrify the TransPennine main line. =Rolling programme= On 28 July 2020, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced plans to phase out fossil fuel use on the railway network by 2035. The plan would see most lines electrified, but suggests that intermittent electrification in difficult places may be implemented. Alternative traction will be implemented rather than electrification for some lightly-used lines. These are the Far North Line, Kyle of Lochalsh Line, West Highland Line, and the southern portion of the Stranraer Line.

A variety of other contents have also been included with the balloons. Originally, these campaigns were organized by the governments and militaries of the Korean states. Contemporarily, however, they are mainly organized by South Korean non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that regularly involve themselves in balloon release events that aim to send materials censored in North Korea, as well as various other goods, to the North Korean people. The main motivations of the South Korean balloon campaigns have been a desire to support democratization and to incite a regime change in North Korea. However, the effectiveness of such leaflet campaigning has been debated. Furthermore, the balloon drops may have worsened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and the launches have also been met with increasing opposition from the South Korean society. The North Korean state has targeted propaganda to South Koreans soldiers on the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in retaliation against Southern propaganda campaigns. The official stance of both the South and North Korean governments has been against the continuing balloon drops. However, the South Korean government has been hesitant to intervene in the launches by activists due to concerns about freedom of expression. However, some actions by officials, like banning the use of boats in balloon launches, have greatly reduced the amount of leaflets flying into North Korea. In recent years, there have been few cases of official leaflet droppings by either state. However, government organized psychological warfare between the Korean states largely disappeared in the aftermath of the Sunshine Policy, regardless of renewed tensions since.  History  A South Korean sentry post seen from North Korea in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) The origins of propaganda campaign competitions on the Korean Peninsula can be traced back to the Korean War, when the United Nations forces shelled Chinese and North Koreans with an estimated total of 2.5 billion leaflets. A historical study has estimated that the amount of leaflets was so great that it would have been enough to cover the whole peninsula under a layer 35 leaflets thick. In comparison, North Koreans only spread 30 million leaflets during the war. The Korean balloons can also be compared with the German situation during the Cold War with ' (wall sailors) sending balloons with goods over the Berlin Wall. Balloon drops were organized by the South Korean state until the beginning of the Sunshine Policy under the Kim Dae-jung administration. Both Koreas halted psychological warfare for the duration of 2004‚Äì2010; in addition to balloons, this prohibited radio broadcasts, billboards and loudspeakers on the DMZ. The North Korean state had originally demanded that as a precondition for the first Inter-Korean summit in 2000, and the request was later accepted by the Kim Dae-jung administration. After the Yeonpyeong incident in 2010, balloon drops were organized by the defense ministry in late 2010 for some time, but they have since been suspended again after having lasted for a year. There have been a few instances of similar balloon propaganda campaigns launched by North Korea to South Korea; however, campaigns on the Korean Peninsula primarily target North Korea. There was a balloon release by North Korea in July 2012 as a response to an official South Korean military leaflet campaign in the aftermath of the Yeonpyeong incident. In 2010, there was public support for a hard line against North Korea during increased tensions, but the support declined by 2011. A poll in late 2014 revealed that recent developments had turned many in South Korea against leaflet campaigns: 58 percent of respondents were against the balloon launches. In May 2018, both Koreas made a commitment to end the balloon propaganda campaign and an attempt made by North Korean defectors to continue the campaign was sabotaged by the South Korean government. On 4 June 2020, Kim Jong-un's sister Kim Yo-jong issued a long statement calling the balloon-senders \\"human scum\\" and \\"mongrel dogs\\". The statement called the South Korean government \\"owners of the mongrel dogs\\" and stated the government should be held accountable for the balloons. Kim Yo-jong threatened to withdraw from a no-hostility pact as well as from joint ventures. South Korea stated within hours that it was planning legislation against the \\"tension-causing\\" balloons. A BBC correspondent stated the rapid compliance \\"is not a good look (for South Korea)... Most defectors have endured incredible hardship to win the right to free speech.\\" On 9 June, North Korea cut all ties to the South, citing the balloon issue. On 10 June, South Korea stated it would press charges, using a law governing inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation, against two South Korean activist groups for sending unauthorized materials to the North.  Balloon contents  A United Nations force leaflet from the Korean War: Kim Il-sung manipulated by alt=A leaflet depicting Kim Il-sung towing a hammer and sickle shaped plough while Mao Zedong spanks him and Joseph Stalin watches and laughs. The South Korean propaganda during the Korean War, through its extensive leafletting involving 2.5 billion leaflets, was also intended to display the capitalist world's ability to outproduce its communist rivals. A study by I. H. Lee found that bias against North Koreans in the South Korean society was prefigured in the visual forms of United Nations propaganda during the Korean War. In comparison, North Korean propaganda during the war largely mirrored contemporary Soviet propaganda. Jin-Heon Jung claims there has been little change in the contents and aims of South Korean leaflets themselves since the transition from military launches to civilian launches. Historically, there have been some oversights in cultural sensitivities in leaflets, such as in translation from South Korean orthography to North Korean orthography. For instance, North Koreans did not understand words like H≈ènggari () or Ssory≈èn (), as they are written in North Korea as Wengari and Rossiya, respectively. The leaflets include a mix of scandals, information and enticements. Some of the leaflets include proselytism for born again Evangelicalism, or Gospels from the Bible. One leaflet reportedly provocatively compared Kim Il-sung to Jesus in its message, saying: \\"Believe Jesus Christ instead of Kim Il Sung\\". During the Cold War, the propaganda competition evolved to resemble a struggle between the two relatively new influences in Korea: communism and Christianity. High-ranking defector Hwang Jang-yop's actions have also been featured in the leaflets. Balloon drops by the South Korean government historically included‚Äîin addition to the propaganda leaflets‚Äîsweets, lighters, tobacco and pornography. Today, the contents launched by non-governmental organizations include various kinds of media and other goods and essentials. They have sent, for example, U.S. dollars, instant noodles, booklets, nylon stockings and high quality socks, friendly letters, radios, as well as DVDs, USB sticks and SD cards with banned media content, such as copies of the Korean Wikipedia. Choco pies have also been included, as they have become prized and valuable items to barter with. After the Sony Pictures Entertainment hacking incident, many activists sent copies of The Interview to North Korea. Some of these movies sent to North Korea have been cut by the activists with the most offensive parts removed. Some of the leaflets launched today are made of light, water-proof polyvinyl. Contemporary leaflets dropped by North Korean government have relatively simple contents, and are reminiscent of propaganda used by the North. The leaflets include various slogans, and North Koreans are known for including racist or sexist contents in propaganda. In 2016 some balloons were filled with trash in addition of propaganda leaflets. Leaflets from the past decades had more varied contents.  South Korean organizations involved  Recent organizations involved with the balloon campaigns include North Korean defectors' organizations, South Korean evangelical Protestants and conservatives, various organizations of other Christian denominations and United States based organizations. In the participating North Korean defectors' organizations, ex-military members are overrepresented. Women constitute up to 70 percent of North Korean defectors; however, it is mainly men from relatively elite or military background who lead the balloon campaigns. The defectors' organizations are the most active ones; the two main organizations for flying leaflets to North Korea are Fighters for a Free North Korea and North Korean Christian Association. Fighters for a Free North Korea, Campaign for Helping North Koreans in Direct Way, North Korean Christian Association and North Korean People's Liberation Front are among the active balloon releasing defectors' groups. However, Park Sang-hak claims that, unlike other defector groups, Fighters for a Free North Korea does not receive funding from the government‚Äîthey have a couple of hundred supporters who donate five to ten U.S. dollars a month. Some of the defector activists, like the North Korean People's Liberation Front, have contacts across the Chinese border area, and smuggle media across the rivers to North Korea. Native South Korean NGOs involved include the National Action Campaign for Freedom and Democracy in Korea, Korean Parents League, Chogabje.com, Family Association of South Korean POWs and Abductees, Cornerstone Ministries, and various others. Suzanne Scholte from the Defense Forum Foundation is the chairwoman of the North Korea Freedom Coalition. The North Korea Freedom Coalition is among the biggest supporters of the organizations involved. Anonymous Christian donors and overseas churches are also a noteworthy source of funding. Park Sang-hak has described their motives as trying to break the information curtain and raise the people's consciousness to encourage North Koreans in overthrowing their leaders. The Human Rights Foundation stresses its beliefs on freedom of speech, self- determination, freedom of association, freedom of movement and democracy. In addition to hoping to topple the regime and agitating, the involved human rights organizations advocate causes like helping refugees, doing humanitarian work for disabled people living in North Korea, proselytizing Christianity, and various other causes.  Role of Protestant Evangelicalism  Protestant Evangelicalism is a common contemporary denominator for the majority of NGOs involved with the balloon drops since the drops became essentially privatized. Jung Jin-heon argues that there has been a polarization in the South Korean society since start of the Sunshine Policy: as the polarization between states decreased, the ideological and political polarization within South Korea increased. Jung notes that Evangelical church leaders have led protests against both regimes. Unlike in other Asian nations, like Japan, South Koreans did not resist Western missionaries, and as a result, Christianity became politically linked to the anti-communist movement in South Korea. The Bush administration's hard line towards North Korea and funding for anti-North organizations has also had an important impact on the formation of an international human rights movement against North Korea. There has also been competition between the two major broadcasting companies in South Korea during the Cold War in the messages sent to the North Korean people. These companies are the government-run Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and the private Evangelical Protestant Far East Broadcasting Corporation. Jung points out that 80 percent of North Koreans arriving in South Korea identify themselves as Christians. These defectors will rely on and stay in touch with churches. Many of them assume leadership positions as activists against the North Korean regime.  Types of balloons  Activists launching propaganda balloons The balloons most commonly used by NGOs are unconventional transparent 12-meter long cylindrical helium- or hydrogen-filled balloons. Sturdy double-walled greenhouse plastic is used for the balloons. The balloons include propaganda messages written on the surface in Korean script. These balloons were developed to replace blimps previously used by the South Korean government, which were no longer being produced. After the balloons travel far enough across the border, a timer opens the plastic bags carried by the balloons. The balloons can travel up to 200 kilometers, and the maximum load for each balloon is 10 kilograms. Fighters for a Free North Korea spends approximately 500 U.S. dollars for each balloon launched; however, the balloons are considered a low-cost solution. Fighters for a Free North Korea has considered improving their GPS capabilities to better understand their balloons' movements. Since early 2015, helicopter drones have been used to distribute materials.  Launch sites  Imjingak's grounds are a frequent spot for the activists' rallies. Imjingak's Imjin Pavilion grounds, the Tongil Park parking lot in the city of Paju and the island of Ganghwa on the west coast are common places for anti-North Korea activists to hold protests and launch balloons. Balloons have also been launched on boats, but launching from boats was prohibited in 2013 by the South Korean government. Park Sang-hak says that Fighters for a Free North Korea was able to send twice as many leaflets to the North Korea using boats. In comparison, during 2014, they managed to fly only seven to eight million leaflets into North Korea. The launches have been met with resistance from the locals living nearby. Fear has also been harmful for local tourism and business. Residents of the city of Paju living near the launch site of Imjingak tried to stop balloons from being launched in October 2014 by blocking the way with tractors. The locals were joined by left-wing activists supporting rapprochement. However, a small group of North Korean defector activists managed to break away and launch 20,000 leaflets from the nearby town of Gimpo. Launching balloons is not illegal, but the South Korean police sometimes intervenes. Some of the failed balloon release attempts have ended in clashes with the South Korean police and activists, such as Park Sang-hak being detained in April 2015. The climate of Korea poses a challenge for the launches, as the winds blow east for 80 percent of the year and only occasionally blow from the south to the north. Balloons sometimes end up in the sea or back to South Korea. There has been a case of the leaflets falling over Seoul due to unreliable weather.  North Korean counter-campaigns  In addition to using balloons as a means of delivery, North Koreans have also used rockets to send leaflets to the DMZ. Many of the retrieved Cold-War era leaflets included maps. One of the leaflets found on the DMZ included a map of Cho Dae-hum's route of defection to North Korea across the DMZ. Many North Korean leaflets during the Cold War gave instructions, in addition to maps, to help the targeted South Korean soldiers in defecting. North Korea restored its balloon leaflet campaign in July 2012 during increased peninsular tensions after the failed missile test involving Kwangmy≈èngs≈èng-3 earlier in April. The propaganda leaflets targeting western border areas in October 2012 praised pro-North activists and criticized the South Korean defense ministry's \\"anti- Pyongyang education program\\". This leaflet campaign occurred after South Korea resumed their own balloon leafletting campaign after the bombardment of Yeonpyeong in 2010‚Äì2011. In October 2012, a total of around 16,000‚Äì17,000 North Korean leaflets were found by patrolling South Korean soldiers. That had been, according to the South Korean defense ministry, the second time in 2012 they discovered North Korean leaflets after North Korea resumed leafletting in July. There had been a 12-year long break with North Korean leafletting. It was reported in 2016 that North Korea was still using leaflets. Unlike in the past, North Korea has adopted a new way of showing its disapproval through propaganda instead of resorting into using military force by shooting across the border. In response to the 2016 South Korean political scandal, North Korea intensified leaflet drops supporting the removal of President Park Geun- hye. In February 2017, North Korean leaflets attacking Donald Trump were found in Seoul. In 2018, North Korea dropped leaflets promoting rapprochement with the South in the upcoming Winter Olympics. North Korea has warned its citizens that the goods carried by the balloons from South Korea are poisoned, but the North Korean people have been known to ignore these warnings. Due to their size, the balloons are easy to track. North Korea has been accused of intercepting the balloons and poisoning their contents to convince its citizens that South Koreans do not have good intentions. Organizations like North Korea Peace responded by substituting food with socks, including a warning and instructions for how to render the poisoned socks harmless. Defector and Korean Peninsula International Peace Organization spokesman Lee Ju-Seong stated in 2012 that one good pair of South Korean socks can be sold for enough corn to feed a child for two months. Activists have accused some of the anti-balloon drop protesters of being paid counter-protesters supported and organized by the North Korean state. However, there is genuine opposition against the launches in the wider South Korean society, beyond the locals near the launch sites. Some counter-protesters object to provoking a nuclear state, and believe that a dialogue with North Korean leadership is needed for the reunification of the Korean peninsula. As some defectors dress in military- style uniforms and sunglasses, this has been a point for objections. Additionally, there is an estimated three to five percent support for the far- left and the Kim regime in South Korea.  Government positions   North Korean government  The North Korean state routinely threatens people involved in the balloon drops. Uriminzokkiri carried a threatening message in 2013 accusing the activists of acting as human shields for the North Korean activist defectors present. The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification, Rodong Sinmun and the National Defense Commission have repeatedly condemned the South Korean government's policy on North Korea. The state of North Korea holds the government of South Korea responsible for the balloon drops, and has demanded for harder actions against the activists. North Korea has also threatened military action. On 1 December 2012, the Secretariat issued a statement demanding then presidential candidate Park Geun-hye to terminate president Lee Myung-bak's policy and to fulfill her presidential election pledge. The Secretariat of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification warned that provokers will be held fully accountable and that the relations of the two states would be again pushed to a catastrophe in the event that the launch would be allowed to happen. Rodong Sinmun stated in October 2014 that the South Korean government's tolerance of the balloon launches is comparable to an act of war. North Korea has reacted most seriously to the leaflets slandering the leaders of North Korea. In summer 2015, one such leaflet launch carried death threats not only to prominent military leaders, but to Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju too, which provoked Committee for Peaceful Reunification to respond three days after the launch. The committee accused that leaflet campaigning could not be conducted without protection from the South Korean National Intelligence Service, Ministry of National Defense or Ministry of Unification.  South Korean government  The South Korean police occasionally prevents balloon releases out of fear that North Korea may retaliate and endanger civilians living nearby. The government has claimed that the actions of the activists are within freedom of expression, and has appealed to the activists not to commit provocations towards North Korea. Chairman Kim Moo-sung of the Saenuri Party was concerned that hardline anti-North Korea activists might not be helping inter-Korean relations, after a balloon launch provoked a shoot-out across the Korean Demilitarized Zone on 10 October 2014. As a response to the criticism that the government is not doing enough to stop the balloon launches, president Park Geun-hye said that the issue would be \\"dealt with in a way that considers both freedom of expression and the safety of local residents\\". A senior official from the Unification ministry spoke anonymously and remarked that previously they tried to stop the balloon releases, but since the Cheonan sinking, they have left the matter to the local police to solve. The local police intervene only if there is violence, or a threat of it.  Effectiveness and outcomes  Some activists claim they can reach Pyongyang (pictured) with their balloons. Multiple organizations involved in the campaigns are in competition with each other as they try to acquire financing for their actions. Ideological differences and different motivations between secular and Christian activists have also caused mutual resentment. Controversially, some organizations have been accused of lying about their leaflets reaching North Korea by a North Korean defector and Evangelical Christian Lee Min-bok, who is a leading figure in the leafletting along with Park Sang-Hak. He accused other organizations of launching balloons from Imjingak even though it would be impossible to reach North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, from there. He suspects that the balloons would fly to the Sea of Japan or, at best, to the mountains in the Kangwon province. He criticized them for trying to get media attention to increase funding. One such launch suspected to be promoting fundraising was made on 19 January 2015 by Human Rights Foundation and Fighters for a Free North Korea. Kim Hueng-kang from North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity says that the balloons are good for pressuring North Korea, even though they tend to fall near the DMZ due to the winds, where there are mostly soldiers to see the leaflets. Park Sang-hak has retained confidence in the balloons, as he says that hundreds of defectors have told to him about having been reached by the leaflets. Lee Min-bok has said that \\"[t]he balloon launch is a primitive humanitarian activity for human rights, which opens eyes, ears and mouths of North Korean people that have been closed by the North Korean regime\\". Lee Min-bok also downplayed the chance of war breaking out as a result of the balloon launches. The Christian organizations have also had their motives questioned. The Christian activists have been accused of being more interested in proselytizing than actually saving people. For instance, a balloon landing on the roof of a farmer's house could bring trouble to the family. Furthermore, Christian literature is an especially dangerous material to have in North Korea. Korean American missionary Douglas Shin has said that Christians have picked up a banner to help North Koreans, and that \\"some people don't like using the word crusade, but that's exactly what this is‚Äîa crusade to liberate North Korea\\". South Korean and U.S. officials and analysts agree that the effects of missionary work are difficult to assess. Furthermore, they say that changing North Korea through religion is very difficult. Jin-Heon Jung reports that a North Korean ex-intelligence agent, Lee Min-bok, told that soldiers indeed liked to see pornographic South Korean pictures; however, they saw it as a sign that the South Korean capitalist society was a completely rotten one. Another North Korean having served as a soldier recalled that he felt disgusted by the pictures. Other ex-soldiers like Lim Young-sun, who runs the online television channel Unification Broadcasting, which shows North Korean propaganda to help in understanding the culture of the North, have stated that the leaflets and contents like candy dropped on the North Korean soil actually calmed their initial hostility towards the South Koreans. The New York Times reported in 2016 that there has been no reliable study on how many North Koreans read the leaflets, or how they react on them. In comparison, South Korean people are known to mostly ignore North Korean leaflets. Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University thinks that leaflets that can only contain a relatively short text are unlikely to convince their readers and as such are ineffective in comparison to, for instance, radio programs. Professor Lee Jung-hoon from Yonsei University is not convinced that an organization such as North Korean People's Liberation Front is able to truly destabilize the North Korean regime, whatever methods they used, as they would have challenges trying to infiltrate North Korean society and posing as an alternative to the regime. Professor Lee Woo-young of the University of North Korean Studies questions how it would be possible to demand North Korea to stop its hostile actions, as sending leaflets across the border is a violation of the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement from 1992. In the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, both governments agreed to stop hostile actions against each other. Suzanne Scholte of the Defense Forum Foundation, an organization working mainly for Sub-Saharan self- determination and North Korean human rights, has called the balloons \\"nuclear missile[s] of truth and hope for North Korean people\\". Director John Feffer from Foreign Policy in Focus argues that the activists should learn from the Polish 'self-limiting revolution' (the Second Solidarity) in 1988‚Äì1989, as pushing one's own government too hard can be harmful to the cause. He criticizes the activists for making maximalist claims about the smuggled information, and for refusing to compromise, as they try to reach their goals. Feffer considers the activists' actions to be harmful because they put human lives in danger, harm inter-Korean dialogue and harm the democratic legitimacy of the South Korean state. However, the launching of balloons has provoked North Korea to threaten activists by warning that it would shell the areas with balloon launches. In October 2014, the North Korean border guards' attempt to shoot down some of the balloons led to a firefight due to North Korean shots landing near a South Korean military base and a residential area. A North Korean spy was arrested in 2011 and accused of trying to assassinate balloon campaign activist Park Sang-hak. In 2014, a North Korean agent posing as a defector was arrested for reportedly attempting to assassinate Choi Jung- hoon, another activist involved in the balloon drops and the commander of the North Korean People's Liberation Front. Jin-Heon Jung points out that the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years. The balloons may contribute to a decay of the remaining cooperation between the Korean governments; activists have been blamed of eagerly trying to destroy any cooperation between the governments. Establishment of Buffer Zone On 1 November 2018, both Koreas established buffer zones near the Korean border. According to the Agreement on the Implementation of the Historic Panmunjom Declaration in the Military Domain, hot air balloons cannot travel within 25 km of the DMZhttps://www.ncnk.org/sites/default/files/Agreement%20on%20the%20Implementation%20of%20the%20Historic%20Panmunjom%20Declaration%20in%20the%20Military%20Domain.pdf  See also  * Cyberactivism in North Korea * Daeseong-dong * Free North Korea Radio * Human rights in North Korea * List of American and British defectors in the Korean War * National Committee for a Free Europe sent leaflets with balloons from West Germany to the Eastern Bloc countries. * Operation Moolah * Peace Village (North Korea) * Second Taiwan Strait Crisis#Aftermath, a similar long lasting psychological warfare involving leaflets and originating from the Cold War era  References   Sources  : : :  External links   * On Balloon Leaflets to North Korea (DOC) at NKnet, a Lee Min-bok's speech at the 7th North Korea strategic forum on 8 December 2008 * Step-by-step gallery of balloons being prepared at Matador Network Aftermath of the Korean War Balloons (aircraft) Censorship in South Korea Human rights in North Korea Human rights in South Korea Political history of South Korea Political repression in South Korea Propaganda techniques by medium Propaganda techniques using information Protests in South Korea Psychological warfare North Korea‚ÄìSouth Korea relations ","title":"Balloon propaganda campaigns in Korea"},{"id":"47085620","text":"Neill of Summerhill is a 1983 biography of the educator A.

When another rock band, Queen, started to become popular, they were obliged to adopt a new name, Hollywood Brats. In 1972, the group added guitarist Eunan Brady - recruited through an advertisement in Melody Maker for a guitarist \\"drunk on scotch and Keith Richards\\" - and bassist Wayne Manor. The band became noted in London for their flamboyant make-up and clothes, and aggressive musical approach, influenced by, and in many ways parallel to, the New York Dolls.

The character made his first screen appearance on 1 April 2013. He was introduced as the brother of Spencer Harrington (Andrew Morley). Ruffo is a well-known professional singer and had previously auditioned for two other roles in the show. He was initially a guest character, but Ruffo was later promoted to the regular cast. With some personality traits resembling his own, Ruffo believed the character was especially written for him. Chris is characterised as a \\"cheeky\\" traveler who comes from a wealthy family. He is not academically gifted and prefers to spend his time trying to impress the show's female characters. Ruffo requested that writers make his character \\"more in-depth\\" so he could show his emotional range. Producers also introduced a comedic pairing with long-running character Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). His first relationship storyline revolves around Indi Walker (Samara Weaving) and they face relationship problems because of her ex-partner's terminal illness and the arrival of Chris' ex-girlfriend Robyn Sullivan (Alexandra Park). He later goes onto share a romance with Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith), which writers developed into a \\"love-triangle\\" plot and resulted in Denny choosing to be with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). Another romantic entanglement was devised for the character when he was coupled with Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth). Other storylines include Chris' need to look after his brother Spencer. Despite Chris' attempts to help, Spencer causes a rift between them. The show also highlighted the dangers of eating wild mushrooms which resulted in Chris accidentally poisoning two fellow characters. In 2014, Ruffo's contribution to the show was recognised with a Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent nomination. On 27 April 2016, it was announced Ruffo was to leave Home and Away and Chris made his final appearance on 22 September 2016. Casting The character and Ruffo's casting was announced on 19 October 2012. Ruffo told Christine Sams of The Sydney Morning Herald that he had asked his agent to check out what roles were available, when the Home and Away part came up. Ruffo had already auditioned for two separate characters but was unsuccessful. After his first audition for Chris, he received a callback for a second audition. Ruffo called himself \\"very fortunate\\" after learning he had won the role because quite a few people also tried out for it. Home and Away marks Ruffo's acting debut and he relocated from Perth to Sydney for filming. He was initially contracted to appear in about sixteen episodes and he began shooting his first scenes in September. Ruffo's contract was later extended. Of his casting, Ruffo stated \\"I'm thrilled to be joining Home and Away. The cast and crew have made me feel so welcome and can't wait for everyone to meet my character Chris next year.\\" The character's first episode was broadcast 1 April 2013. While contracted to home and Away, Ruffo continued to work on his music career and remained signed to a major record label. Development Characterisation and introduction Chris is Spencer Harrington's (Andrew Morley) older brother. He comes to Summer Bay to visit Spencer and convince him to return home and sort things out with his family. He also causes trouble and disrupts Spencer's relationship with Maddy Osborne (Kassandra Clementi). Ruffo thought that the scriptwriters had written the character just for him and he described Chris as being \\"fun and cheeky, he's a bit of a ladies' man and a little bit cheesy like me. He's a traveller who has been around, much like myself.\\" The actor also called him \\"a lover, not a fighter\\" and added that he likes to stir the pot. Sams wrote that Chris would become the \\"focal point\\" of a romantic storyline and some family dramas. Chris is from a rich family and enjoys the perks that it brings. He does not like responsibility and is not characterised as being intelligent. Following his brother's birth, he was happy that his parents focused all their attention on Spencer being the successful sibling. Chris prefers trying to impress females, of this Ruffo said \\"he's a fun guy, he likes the ladies and he's confident.\\" As Chris was initially a guest character his he was a \\"pretty straightforward, open character\\". Writers expanded the role when Ruffo became a more prominent cast member. Chris' personality was made \\"more in-depth\\" following a request made by Ruffo, at the time he stated, \\"I wanted to show a lot more emotion. That challenges me.\\" Producers decided to have Ruffo working closely with Lynne McGranger who plays Irene Roberts and form a comedy partnership. Irene takes Chris into her home as a lodger and then gives him a job. Ruffo said that \\"Chris lives with Irene, he works with Irene in the diner and they have this \\"mother/son\\" relationship and its a lot of fun to work with her. She is always telling me off.\\" McGranger also enjoyed the on-screen partnership and branded Ruffo one of her favourite cast members to work with. McGranger told Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy that the two characters share \\"good comedy scenes\\" and she \\"loved\\" working on the relationship. Relationship with Indi Walker The character's first relationship storyline is with Indi Walker (Samara Weaving). Chris tries to romance Indi following her terminally ill husband's (Romeo Smith played by Luke Mitchell) departure. Following a short- time away from Summer Bay (due to Ruffo's break in filming) Chris returns and declares that we wants to be with Indi. Ruffo told Jessica Grubb from TV Week that Chris is at first hesitant to tell Indi how he feels. But he does tell her that he really cares about her. He described Indi's reluctance to move on from Romeo as \\"a bit of a battle\\" for Chris, but believed the timing was good because she was at least ready to \\"have her mind taken off things\\". Chris does face oppostition from Indi's sister Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman) who dislikes him and thinks that Indi is too vulnerable for a new relationship. Chris decides that he needs to impress Indi and arrives at her home with a horse- drawn-carriage to transport them to a romantic meal. Ruffo defended his character's grand gestures and stated \\"Chris is trying to impress Indi as much as he can\\" and believes this to be the solution. Indi is \\"bemused\\" by Chris' actions but decides to accompany him to dinner. She sees a \\"softer side\\" to Chris and \\"warms to him a bit more\\" as a result. Sasha continues to bemoan Chris' presence but Indi's brother Dexter Walker (Charles Cottier) offers his approval. Their relationship becomes complicated with the arrival of Chris' ex-girlfriend Robyn Sullivan (Alexandra Park). Indi had decided to move on following her realisation that Romeo would have wanted her to be happy. Ruffo believed that his character's outlook on relationships had changed via his involvement with Indi. He said that \\"Indi's made Chris realise there's more to girls than just one-night-stands. She definitely changed the way he thinks.\\" Chris also learns that making a connection with another takes commitment so the pair reach a decision to make their relationship official. But soon after Robyn arrives and \\"throws a spanner in the works\\". Ruffo explained that Chris fears his relationship with Indi will be ruined by Robyn's arrival. The pair had not been together for long and Robyn causing issues makes him question their future. Robyn wants Chris back and makes her intention known. He is keen to see her leave Summer Bay, but Indi witnesses this and misinterprets it to be an intimate moment. Indi is upset and presumes it is evidence that Chris is cheating on her. He decides to keep Robyn's declaration a secret, but Indi questions him, Ruffo the worse thing is\\" that Chris lies to Indi which causes trouble for their relationship. The show created more problems for the duo in the lead up to Samara Weaving's departure from the show. Indi receives news that Romeo has died and this leaves her devastated. Ruffo said that while \\"Chris and Indi are a good couple\\", she has unresolved personal issues surrounding Romeo's illness and death. Ruffo added that it prevented Indi from being fully invested in his character. Indi pushes Chris away, but the actor stressed Chris tries his best to support her. But Indi's behavior continues and Chris is hurt by her actions because he believed they had overcome their problems. Romeo's presence in their relationship was constant through the storyline. Ruffo believed his character often feels inadequate because of Romeo, that \\"he isn't good enough for Indi\\". The events lead Indi to question her life and she decides that she needs a fresh start traveling. Chris is \\"stunned\\" by her decision but he tells Irene he is leaving with \\"the love of his life\\" Indi informs him that their relationship has come to an end and she will leave without him. Weaving believed that it was \\"done in a healthy way\\" and she was not running away from Chris. Helping Spencer One of Chris' recurrent roles has been to help his brother Spencer through his many personal problems. But there is also much confrontation between the two as Spencer feels that Chris is interfering in his life. One such episodic block featured Chris trying to be an advisor in Spencer's relationship issues with Maddy, but ends up causing more trouble. Spencer suffers from Bipolar disorder and take medication to control the symptoms. Spencer later begins a relationship with Sasha and decides to stop taking his medication in order to regain control. Chris is \\"understandably alarmed\\" by Spencer's actions and questions him. Morley said that his character is annoyed with Chris and orders him to stop interfering. He added that \\"Chris knows how bad Spencer can become\\" with his bipolar disorder. But Chris tries to mask his concerns because of \\"family pride\\". Indi is Sasha's sister so is also drawn into the storyline over her fears for Sasha's wellbeing while with Spencer. Morley explained that Chris is in an \\"awkward position\\" because he wants to remain loyal to his brother but also offer reassurance to his girlfriend too. Spencer's behaviour becomes more erratic and Chris tries to intervene. Morely said (in a TV Week interview) that \\"he takes what Chris says as an attack and his brother trying to control his life.\\" Spencer then punches Chris, he becomes angry and just wants to take it out on Chris. Morely described it as a \\"heart-breaking situation\\" of someone turning on their own brother. But his anger causes him to pass out and Chris is left fearing for his younger brother's life. Chris becomes even more concerned when Spencer joins a cult at \\"Sanctuary Lodge\\" to help him control his disorder. Chris decides to attempt to help his brother again. Chris does not want Spencer to be brainwashed and visits him at the lodge. But Chris is rude to the cult leader, Morley said that Spencer is ashamed of Chris and he again turns violent towards his sibling. Chris and Spencer learn that their father has been badly injured in a car accident. Ruffo described it as \\"not the greatest news, he is his brother so they deal with it together and have decisions to make, it is going to be tough for them.\\" Spencer decides to go visit his father following the accident. But Spencer decides to leave Summer Bay after re-evaluating his life, following Morley being written out of Home and Away, leaving Chris without any on-screen family. Mushroom poisonings Producers decided to highlight the danger of misidentification of non-edible poisonous mushrooms. Chris was at the center of the storyline after he picks wild mushrooms as ingredients for a risotto. Chris is unaware that he has picked out death cap mushrooms, which are usually fatal if consumed. Two characters, Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) and Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) eat Chris' risotto and succumb to mushroom poisoning. Leah is first to gain symptoms and collapses in her home leading to her hospitalisation. Chris accompanies Alf on a boat ride when the engine fails. Then Alf's symptoms begin to surface and Chris rushes to save his life. But with his mobile telephone not working he is forced to load Alf into a dinghy to try and reach the shore, while Alf's condition deteriorates. Ruffo said that his character has to act fast and added \\"Chris is feeling incredibly guilty. He can't stop beating himself up about it.\\" Alf begins to recover following treatment but Leah goes into liver failure and experiences bleeding. Chris is \\"guilt-racked\\" by what he has done. He organises a community meeting to inform locals of Leah's condition and to appeal for a liver donor. Chris' actions draw in a number of people wanting to be tested. Nicodemou told a TV Week reporter that Leah is \\"overwhelmed\\" at the support she receives because of Chris' actions. The actress also told Susan Hill from the Daily Star that fellow victim Alf decides put himself forward as her liver donor. Relationship with Denny Miller Writers developed a new romance for Chris in 2014. Chris feels an attraction to Denny Miller (Jessica Grace Smith) and tries to convince her to date him. But he faces competition from Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes) who writers also wrote into Chris' storyline. Ruffo told a reporter from stuff.co.nz that \\"Chris is definitely falling for Denny but in the back of his mind there's this shadow of doubt about Casey.\\" Casey is a River Boy and has a reputation as being \\"strong and buff\\", and Chris feels threatened by him because Casey's \\"bad-boy attitude\\" could appeal to Denny. Chris behaves in an over-confident manner and his attempts to impress Denny go \\"spectacularly wrong\\" despite believing she will fall for him. Ruffo defended his character's misfortune with Denny stating \\"I think Chris thinks he's a lot more adorable than what he is sometimes, he's that happy-go-lucky kind of guy who sometimes opens his mouth and says things he thinks are going to help but instead brings things back a few pegs.\\" Chris eventually manages to gain Denny's attentions and she confesses her love. But Chris is hesitant to accept her change of mind. Smith told Rebecca Lake (TV Week) that Chris \\"has the typical man reaction and starts freaking out.\\" But Denny is a \\"straight-up\\" type of character and order Chris to decide what he wants. Writers continued to involve Casey in their relationship forming a \\"love-triangle\\" plot. As a TV Soap writer observed that Denny and Casey's \\"undeniable\\" chemistry \\"was plain to see\\" and Chris had his \\"fair share of bumpy patches\\" with Denny. The development occurs when Chris decides he wants his relationship with Denny to be serious. She has doubts because of her growing feelings for Casey. Younes told Lake that Casey does not want to steal another man's girlfriend and distances himself from Denny. But when Denny cancels her gym membership to avoid Casey he decides he must make his feelings known and kisses her. Denny begins avoiding Chris due to her guilt. Smith told Shannon Molloy from TV Week that her character feels bad and is unsure of how to let Chris know about the kiss. She added \\"when he finds out, he's pretty upset\\" and he punches Casey in the face. Tired of Denny's confusion Chris dumps her, she tries to save their relationship but he realises that she wants to stay with him out of guilt. Relationship with Hannah Wilson In 2015, writers devised a new relationship for Chris with Hannah Wilson (Cassie Howarth). The pair become better acquainted when they work together on a fund-raising event. Irene suggests that the two should form a relationship, but Hannah does not take her advice seriously. Howarth told a TV Week reporter that Hannah only views Chris as a friend and had not thought romance was a possibility. When Chris' ex- girlfriend Ivana Frost (Tegan Martin) pays a visit to Summer Bay, he decides he must prove he has been successful and moved on. Chris convinces Hannah to pose as his girlfriend but Ivana does not believe them. They fake a kiss to fool Ivana's suspicions. Howarth commented that her character thinks she is helping Chris because \\"Hannah loves hanging out with Chris. She thinks he is really funny and he is a breath of fresh air.\\" The duo later succumb to their feelings and begin a relationship. But writers soon added problems playing Hannah trying to keep the romance a secret. Chris eventually threatens to leave Hannah and she publicly confirms their relationship to other characters. Writers later reintroduced Hannah's ex-boyfriend Andy Barrett (Tai Hara) into the story to form a love triangle. Howarth said that her character would try to \\"right her wrongs\\" in 2016. Hannah wants \\"a fresh start\\" and make it work. But by episodes airing in February 2016, Hannah succumbs to Andy's advances while still with Chris. Hara told Downie that Andy has always loved Hannah, been through a lot with her and it marked the first time she reciprocates and is unfaithful to Chris. Departure On 27 April 2016, Channel 7 announced through Twitter that Ruffo had left Home and Away to pursue new challenges. Ruffo stated, \\"I've loved my time in Summer Bay. There's a lot more coming up for Chris and I hope fans continue enjoying his time on screen.\\" Reception For his portrayal of Chris, Ruffo was nominated in the category of \\"Most Popular New Talent\\" at the 2014 Logie Awards. Tom Williams of The Daily Edition said that Ruffo was \\"stealing the show as the trouble-making, heart- breaking Chris\\". While his co-presenter Monique Wright observed the character as having \\"a lot of tough times and unrequited love\\". A writer from stuff.co.nz branded the character a \\"likeable clown\\". A TV Week reporter noted that there appeared to be a rivalary between the Harrington brothers, adding \\"there hasn't been much brotherly love between Chris and Spencer.\\" Mark James Lowe from All About Soap said that he loved the character and branded him an \\"unsung hero\\". Watching Chris grieve for Hannah upset the critic and his co- workers. Lowe added that the character had been \\"a great addition to Irene‚Äôs harem of waifs and strays, with his cheeky demeanour and caring attitude.\\" References External links * Chris Harrington at the official AU Home and Away website Home and Away characters Television characters introduced in 2013 Fictional waiting staff Fictional lifeguards Male characters in television ","title":"Chris Harrington (Home and Away)"},{"id":"47085725","text":"Karjasilta is a district in the H√∂yhty√§ area in the city of Oulu, Finland.

Throughout history, armed priests or soldier priests have been recorded. Distinguished from military chaplains who served the military or civilians as spiritual guidance (non-combatants), these priests took up arms and fought in conflicts (combatants). The term warrior priests is usually used for armed priests of the antiquity and Middle Ages, and of historical tribes. History In Greek mythology, the Curetes were identified as armed priests. In Ancient Rome, the Salii who were armed priests carried sacred shields through the city during the March festivals. Livy (59 BC‚Äì17 AD) mentions armati sacerdotes (armed priests). Medieval European canon law said that a priest could not be a soldier, and vice versa. Priests were allowed on the battlefield as chaplains, and could only defend themselves with clubs. The Aztecs had a vanguard of warrior priests who carried deity banners and made sacrifices on the battlefield. A Cherokee priest who killed during battle received the title of Nu no hi ta hi. The warrior-priest was a common figure in the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì13). Several archpriests and priests were commanders in the uprising. Serbian Orthodox monasteries sent monks to join the ranks of the Serbian Army. Legacy The \\"Pyrrhic\\" dance in Crete is said to have been the ritual dance of armed priests.

Today, the redoubt and chapel still exist and they are in good condition. History The redoubt's platform, with the chapel to the left The site has been inhabited since the Bronze Age and silos of the period are still found at the coast next to the redoubt. Saint George Redoubt was built in 1714‚Äì1716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. It was part of a chain of fortifications that defended Marsaxlokk Bay, which also included three other redoubts, the large Saint Lucian Tower, two smaller De Redin towers, seven batteries and three entrenchments. The redoubt was built on the site of a cemetery. It incorporated the Chapel of St. George, which had been built in 1683 on the site of an earlier chapel. Apart from being the only Hospitaller redoubt incorporating a church, St. George Redoubt is also unusual since it has a semi-circular shape, while most redoubts were pentagonal. The semi- circular platform is ringed by a low parapet. The walls linking the redoubt to the church are pierced by musketry loopholes, while the doorway had a ditch and a drawbridge. Sometime after 1741, two fougasses were excavated behind the redoubt. They are now located within private houses. Present day Musketry loopholes Today, the chapel and redoubt are managed by the Missionary Society of St Paul.

RBIS, as the Reference Broadcast Time Synchronization (RBS), is a receiver/receiver synchronization protocol, as a consequence timestamps used for clock regulation are acquired only on the receiving of synchronization events. RBIS is specifically tailored to be used in IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi networks configured in infrastructure mode. Such a kind of networks are based on an access point that coordinates the communication between the wireless nodes (i.e., the STAs), and they are very common. The advantages of RBIS are that it can be directly used with common access points, no modification is required to the STAs (or minor modifications to improve synchronization performance) and a very small overhead is added to the wireless channel (typically a message every 1 second). Moreover, it allows an easily synchronization with an external time source, because it is a master/slave protocol. Its major drawback is that it does not compensate the propagation delay. This fact limits the achievable synchronization quality to a couple of microsecond, which is typically enough for the very majority of the applications, especially for home automation.

She and her court remained there until her death in 1369. In the 15th century the manor was known as Queen's Court. In 1654 Francis Rolle purchased the manor and it remained in the Rolle family until 1801.

Hirst, Debus, and Galloway served on the college staff. John Tyndall and Edward Frankland were science-masters there for about a year in 1847‚Äì48 before leaving together to study in Germany. The college taught students until 1896 and then closed. The buildings of the college burnt down in 1902, and all of the buildings connected with the college were demolished in 1904.

It's a story of a young girl, who was brought up in prostitution business area of town and was taught to dance and sing. She was famous for her voice and beauty. One day she went outside the barn for dancing in a birthday party and there after watching the bond of a mother and child, she wished to become a mother. Plot Kajal (Savera Nadeem), a famous professional eastern classical singer and dancer was invited in a birthday party to perform. She observed the feeling of a mother for child and wished to become a mother. Kajal's foster mother (Afshan Qureshi) didn't want her to have baby, but she insisted and in the end the mother made a deal with Sikandar Ali Khan (Ayub Khoso) and decided to sell her Virginity to start prostitution. Her musician, Wafa (Sohail Asghar), told Kajal about her mother's plan and they both ran away leaving the barn in dark. They shifted to another city, got married and started their new life. After some time they were blessed with a baby girl, whom they named Mahnoor (moon light) as they thought she came into the world to enlighten their life. Mahnoor (Sara Loren) liked a boy Rohail (Kamran Jillani) who loved her very much and wanted to marry her. But the mother wanted her to study as much as she can. Girl shared her feelings with her father who supported her and convinced his wife. Mahnoor won first prize in college singing function and approached by music company but her mother didn't give her permission. On Mahnoor's refusal, the owner of music company (Hassan Shaheed Mirza) asked Mahnoor, why her mother didn't like her singing when she herself was very famous for her own singing? Mahnoor who was not aware of her parents' past was little surprised by this news. The college function story covered by the newspaper and Firdos Bai tracked them through that news. Firdos Bai demanded Kajal to give Mahnoor for prostitution and singing at her business place to compensate the loss she had due to Kajal and Wafa's leaving barn. Her father shared the whole story of their past with Mahnoor. Kajal was not prepared to let her daughter go to that place which she left once. Rather she preferred to go herself with Firdos Bai. Mahnoor after knowing the truth of her parents, helped them along with her fianc√©. They ordered Firdos and her pimp Gullo (Akbar Subhani) to leave the house or they will contact police and saved her mother.

Director Stephen Winter was working on The Butler, his third film with Lee Daniels, when Sarah Schulman, renowned writer and activist, proposed that two of their mutual friends, performers Jack Waters and Bizzy Barefoot, had conceived a character based on Jason Holliday from the 1967 documentary Portrait of Jason by Shirley Clarke. Schulman's idea was for Winter to direct a new film about the \\"behind the scenes\\" of Portrait of Jason starring Waters as \\"Jason\\" and Schulman as \\"Shirley.\\" The film would not be a remake, but a fiction that drew upon emotional truths from the point-of-view of Jason Holliday. Production came together quickly, as did the script. Waters was in charge of writing \\"Jason,\\" and Schulman was tasked with \\"Shirley.\\" A team from New York's vibrant New Queer Vanguard of Brooklyn and other diverse artistic blocs was assembled. Ned Stresen-Reuter became Director of Photography and Editor. Winter met Producer Jason Ryan Yamas when he worked with Jonathan Caouette on the sequel to his internationally influential documentary Tarnation, which Winter produced. Artist and bon vivant Bizzy Barefoot was the choice for Production Design and Costumes. Bizzy also served as acting coach for Jack Waters, with Broadway veteran Schele Williams. Winter wrote roles for the actors he wished to cast. Mike Bailey Gates is an emerging video artist, photographer and fashion muse, perfect for the mysterious spirit \\"Billy-Boy.\\" Eamon Fahey, as na√Øf \\"Nico\\" is a New York native Winter has known since he was a teen. Bryan Webster plays 'Candy Man,' and was Winter's first friend upon moving to New York. Peter Cramer as \\"The Matron\\" is a central downtown fixture and Jack Waters' better half. Denise Dixon, \\"Momma,\\" is Winter's neighbor and a Brooklyn science teacher. Tristan Cowen as \\"John,\\" hardworking cameraman, is Winter's \\"Game of Thrones\\" buddy. Orran Farmer, Winter's brother-in-law, came out of actor-retirement to play handsome, authoritative \\"Carl.\\" And Tony Torn as racist DP \\"Saul\\" starred in the first play Winter saw in New York, \\"Tight Right White\\" by the legendary Reza Abdoh. Torn's parents Rip Torn and Geraldine Page were present at the first screening of Portrait of Jason in 1967 ‚Äì another example of the fantastic synchronicity this project experienced. The only inspiration films Winter watched were Hitchcock's Psycho and The Trial by Orson Welles, both starring haunted gay icon Anthony Perkins. Winter writes: Reception The film received rave reviews in advance of its BAMcinemaFest premiere. Richard Brody of The New Yorker hailed it as \\"one of this year's finest offerings ... ingeniously conceived and acted.\\" A.O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \\"self-contained drama that feels like a documentary, and a historical re-enactment that seems to be happening in the present even as it offers astute commentary on the past.\\" Tavia Nyong'o of The Guardian wrote: Jonas Mekas, a contemporary of Shirley Clarke and Jason Holliday, said the film was \\"amazing ... like being back in Shirley's apartment.\\" Jason and Shirley also received ringing endorsements from John Cameron Mitchell, Ira Sachs, John Krokidas, and Jonathan Caouette. Amy Heller of Milestone Films, who have restored and released much of Shirley Clarke's cinematic legacy, was scathing of the film's liberally applied artistic license and many historical inaccuracies.

He is known for translating Western classics into Turkish in the 1940s, including those of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Anton Chekhov and Moli√®re. He was deported from Turkey in the 1950s due to an article that he wrote about the Soviet Union and emigrated to Israel in 1956, where he lived until his death in 2009. Biography G√ºney was born Misha Rottenberg in Odessa, to a Ukrainian Jewish family. His family emigrated to Turkey following the October Revolution in 1917. He graduated from St. Joseph High School and studied philosophy at Istanbul University. During this time, he acquired Turkish citizenship and changed his name to Erol G√ºney. In the 1940s, he joined a translation bureau led by then-Minister of Education Hasan √Çli Y√ºcel and Sabahattin Ali. G√ºney, who was fluent in Turkish, Russian, English, and French, translated various works of Western literature, including Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard and Gogol's The Government Inspector. During his time at the translation bureau, he befriended important figures of Turkish literature, including Sabahattin Ey√ºboƒülu, Azra Erhat, Cahit K√ºlebi, Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k, Necati Cumalƒ±, and Melih Cevdet Anday. Following the demise of Turkey's single party period and Hasan √Çli Y√ºcel's resignation, the translation bureau lost its function and G√ºney left it to focus on journalism. He began working for Agence France-Presse. In 1955, he was exiled to Yozgat due to an article he wrote about the Soviet Union. Later, his Turkish citizenship was revoked and he was deported to France. In 1956, he emigrated to Israel and settled in Tel Aviv. G√ºney continued to work as a journalist in Israel. He also started writing for the Istanbul-based Jewish newspaper ≈ûalom. He became Yedioth Ahronoth's Washington, D.C. correspondent in the 1980s. He was blacklisted from entering Turkey until 1990; he frequently visited Istanbul afterwards. G√ºney was married to Dora G√ºney, who emigrated to Israel with him. Both were close friends of poet Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k, who dedicated a well-known poem cycle to G√ºney and his cat, Edibe. He also had a daughter, Eleanore, from a Parisian woman.

Life Catherine Isabella Osborne was born at Newtown Anner House, near Clonmel, County Tipperary on 30 June 1818. The second child, she was the only daughter of Sir Thomas Osborne and Catherine Rebecca Osborne (n√©e Smith). Sir Thomas was a prominent landowner in south County Tipperary and County Waterford, and served as MP for Carysfort, County Wicklow from 1776 to 1797. Catherine Rebecca Osborne was born in England, possibly Kent, and was a very religious woman. Osborne's only brother William died in May 1824 aged 8, which left her the sole heir to the Osborne estate, with her uncle receiving the baronetcy. Osborne was noted for keeping an entertaining, lively and cultivated house, playing host to artists such as Thomas Shotter Boys and Alexandre Calame. Boys exhibited a painting he completed at Newtown Anner in 1865, which is his only known Irish watercolour. Osborne was an early patron of Calame, and it is believed employed him to give her daughter's guidance in painting. She was interested in photography, with William Despard Hemphill dedicating his collection of published photographs of Clonmel to her in 1860 following her support. Osborne was a talented artist, producing a series of sketchbooks of Irish and English country houses. These are now held in the family home of her daughter in Myrtle Grove, Youghal. She edited and published two volumes of her mother's letters in 1870, Memorials of the life and character of Lady Osborne. Osborne financed the library at Knockmahon in County Waterford. She died at Newtown Anner on 21 June 1880, and is buried at Killaloan church in the family vault. Family Osborne met Ralph Bernal in London in 1844, at the residence of Lady Sydney Morgan. Before the couple were married on 20 August 1844, Bernal took the name Osborne, his name becoming Ralph Bernal Osborne. It would appear that the marriage was not a happy one, and Bernal Osborne spent much of his time in London pursuing a political career at Westminster. In 1863, Osborne published a novel anonymously, False Positions, which is described as a \\"thinly disguised attack\\" on her husband. Osborne stayed at Newtown Anner to raise the couple's two daughters, Edith and Grace. Edith married Henry Arthur Blake, against her parents wishes, and was styled Lady Blake. Grace went on to be the second wife of William Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St Albans.

It was originally to be erected on a site between the Supreme Court of Canada and the National Library of Canada but in December 2015, Canadian Heritage Minister M√©lanie Joly suggested that the National Capital Commission instead approve a 500 square metre site half a kilometre to the west, in the Garden of the Provinces and Territories. Under the revised timeline, a national competition was held in 2016 and 2017 to select a new design for the monument. The site was dedicated in a ceremony held on November 2, 2017. Construction began in early November 2019, and is expected to be completed by the summer of 2020. Joly complained that the previous Harper government had made the project too controversial. The new Liberal government has moved the site and cut its budget. She stated: :Commemorative monuments play a key role in reflecting the character, identity, history and values of Canadians. They should be places of reflection, inspiration and learning, not shrouded in controversy.\\" Don Butler, \\"Victims of communism memorial to be moved, Joly announces,\\" 00 Ottawa Citizen December 17, 2015 The winning design was announced in May 2017 as Arc of Memory designed by Toronto architect Paul Raff in partnership with designer and arborist Michael A. Ormston-Holloway, and landscape architects Brett Hoornaert and Luke Kairys, and was described by the selection committee as follows: :The Arc of Memory features two gently curving wall-like metal frames totalling 21 metres in length and almost 4 metres in height. The walls support more than 4000 short bronze rods densely arranged along 365 steel fins, each one pointing at a unique angle of the sun, for every hour of every day, across a year. :The memorial would be split in the middle at winter solstice, the darkest day of the year, inviting visitors to step through in a metaphorical journey from darkness and oppression to lightness and liberty. Origins In 2007, Secretary of State for Multiculturalism Jason Kenney toured Masaryktown, a private park owned by the Czech and Slovak community in Toronto, with Czech ambassador Pavel Vosalik and saw Crucified Again, a statue of a tortured man crucified on a hammer and sickle, commemorating victims of Soviet oppression. Kenney commented to the ambassador that the public should be able to see such a monument and they discussed the idea of creating a memorial in Ottawa, Ontario. Tribute to Liberty was founded the next year as a charity with the mission of building a monument to the victims of Communism. Its 9-member board is composed of members of ethnocultural communities and whose families originate from various former or still Communist states. The founding chair of the group was Philip Leong who had run as a candidate for the conservative Canadian Alliance in the 2000 federal election and is described by the National Post as a friend of Kenney's and an admirer of Stephen Harper. Alide Forstmanis, the group's treasurer who has also served as chair, ran for the Conservative Party of Canada nomination in Kitchener‚ÄîWaterloo in 2007 while another former director, Wladyslaw Lizon was later elected a Conservative Member of Parliament. The National Capital Commission, in 2009, approved the proposal to build the monument in the National Capital Region with a specific site to be determined later. It suggested modifying the memorial's name, which was originally \\"A Monument to Victims of Totalitarian Communism: Canada, A Land of Refuge\\", so that it would commemorate victims of oppressive regimes generally but Tribute to Liberty refused, however the term \\"totalitarian\\" was dropped. Site and design In 2011, the National Capital Commission approved a site for the monument at the Garden of the Provinces and Territories however, in 2012, the then-Conservative federal government announced that the memorial would be built instead on a more prominent parcel of land between the Supreme Court of Canada and the National Library of Canada that had been designated for over a century as the future location of a new federal court. In 2014, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin expressed her concern that the memorial \\"could send the wrong message within the judicial precinct, unintentionally conveying a sense of bleakness and brutalism that is inconsistent with a space dedicated to the administration of justice.\\" A design was selected later in 2014 consisting of a series of folded concrete rows with 100 million \\"memory squares\\" to commemorate victims. A member of the design selection jury, architect Shirley Blumberg, complained that the pool of proposals the jury had to select from was \\"poor\\" and that \\"the one that was selected by the jury was, I think, particularly brutalist and visceral.\\" In June 2015, the National Capital Commission revised the design, reducing its size so that it would cover 37% of the site rather than 60%, reducing the number of folded concrete rows to five from seven, reducing its height from 14 metres to 8 metres, and moving it further back from Wellington Street and changing its focus to telling the story of refugees from Communist states. New government and scrapping of original proposal The Conservative government of Stephen Harper had pledged $3 million for the construction of the project, with the remaining amount to be raised by Tribute to Liberty. However, following the 2015 federal election, which resulted in a new Liberal government led by Justin Trudeau taking office, it was reported that no government money would be going towards the project. Subsequently, however, it was announced that construction of the project had been capped at a total cost of $3 million, reduced from $5.5 million, with the Department of Canadian Heritage's contribution to be capped at $1.5 million and the rest to be provided by Tribute to Liberty, thus reducing the government's financial commitment to half its previous pledge. In addition, Heritage Minister Joly has asked that a new design be chosen for the monument with the general public being involved \\"from the outset of the design process through to final selection.\\" On December 17, 2015, the government requested that the site of the monument be moved to the Garden of the Provinces and Territories and that a new design be chosen. On January 20, 2016, the National Capital Commission rescinded its previous approval for the Supreme Court of Canada site. As well, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada (RAIC) announced that it had discontinued its court case against the NCC which would have challenged its approval of the Supreme Court of Canada site stating: \\"The RAIC is delighted to be ending the legal proceedings and look forward to a more appropriate commemoration being proposed.\\" An online survey asking Canadians their opinions on the proposed monument was opened by the federal government in February 2016; the results were passed on to the design teams. The designs of the five finalists for the monument, renamed Canada: A Place of Refuge, were unveiled on March 2, 2017 with the winner was announced in May. The memorial will recognize Canada's \\"role as a place of refuge for people fleeing injustice and persecution, and honour the millions oppressed by communist regimes.\\" The monument was expected to be completed by late 2018 or early 2019, but work finally commenced in November 2019.

It has a head-and-body length of . Biology Brachytrupes membranaceus is nocturnal. It digs a burrow that may be deep, with chambers in which it stores food. The burrow is dug by the mandibles, and the fore-legs are used to move loose soil and push it out of the entrance. An adult cricket may form a mound up to in height beside the burrow entrance. The crickets live almost entirely underground, each in its own burrow. Mating takes place in the male's burrow and the female may remain there till the eggs are laid, in a walled-off side tunnel. In Zimbabwe, breeding takes place in February and March. The female lays around two hundred eggs which hatch about a month later. The nymphs crawl out of the burrow and disperse, each digging a burrow of its own. At first the nymphs grow rapidly but growth slows during the dry season from June to October. When succulent young plant material becomes available in November, growth rates speed up, with adults emerging from December onwards. There is just one generation each year. The diet is grasses, succulent parts of plants and the suckers of trees such as Brachystegia and Isoberlinia. In cultivated areas, foodstuffs may include seedlings, transplanted plants, vegetables, tobacco, maize and field beans. Vegetable matter is carried underground and packed into storage chambers. It does not ferment, so it is probable that it is cut and allowed to wilt before being carried underground. Overly dry material may be allowed to soften with dew before storage.

It competes in the Liberty Rugby Conference at a D1A level. Like other Fordham University athletic teams, Fordham ruggers are called the Fordham Rams. With over 100 members, Fordham Rugby is one of the most popular athletic club sports teams at Fordham.  History  The Fordham \\"Irish\\" team pre-kickoff for the 2005 Spring Weekend rugby match The Fordham University Rugby Football Club celebrated its 50th Anniversary Season in 2012, making it one of the oldest rugby teams in New York City. FURFC's stated mission is to display a commitment through strength of effort embodied in physical perseverance and mental determination. Fordham Rugby embodies the values of collaboration, dedication, and individual responsibility to the whole in all aspects of life. In recent years, an additional emphasis on community service has reinforced the Club's commitment to the University's Jesuit ideals. FURFC is often referred to as \\"The Bronx's Oldest and Toughest Brotherhood.\\" This is exemplified by many FURFC alumni who go on to participate in Fordham's Old Maroon Rugby Football Club which is based out of the Bronx as well. Notable alumni include Ryan McTiernan, Edward Cullen, and Mike Durant(all former USA U-20 Eagles) as well as Tony Reali (host of ESPN's Around the Horn). September 11, 2001 Like the rest of the New York community and American nation, Fordham Rugby was personally struck by the attacks on 9/11. In the collapse of the Twin Towers, six FURFC alumni where tragically taken: Michael Armstrong, Matthew J. Burke, Christopher Robert Clarke, Thomas Anthony Mahon, Christian Maltby, and John McDowell Jr. Fordham Rugby remembers all those who perished, especially its own fallen brothers. FURFC maintains a tradition of remembering these six individuals before they take the pitch for every match. Scholarship Michael J. Breslin III died on May 15, 1987 while a senior at Fordham University. He was remembered by his family, friends, and FURFC through the Michael J. Breslin III Scholarship Fund. The fund assists students of Fordham College at Rose Hill and the Gabelli School of Business in the payment of tuition expenses, with preference given to members of the Fordham University Rugby Football Club. The recipients are selected by the deans of Fordham College at Rose Hill and the Gabelli School of Business on the basis of academic achievement and financial need.  Records and highlights  Fordham Rugby has consistently performed well both nationally and regionally, most recently in 2009 when FURFC reached the NRU D1 Playoff Final Four and were crowned Metropolitan New York D1 Champions. In 2009 FURFC also won the storied Cherry Blossoms Tournament. The year prior in 2008, FURFC fell short of the title and finished runner-up in the Metropolitan New York D1 final. In April 2016, Fordham Rugby won the Empire Rugby Conference 7s Championship Series. By winning the Empire Conference, Fordham Rugby's 7s Team qualified to compete for a national title at the USA Rugby College 7s National Championships. The team was also a D1 regional power during the 1990s despite sharing the division with perennial champion Army, who regularly appeared in the national title game during this period. Fordham was Army's toughest division rival during these years and regularly finished near the top of the conference. From 1992 to 1996, Fordham qualified for the national championship playoffs playing Harvard, UConn, Navy, and Buffalo respectively in the national tournament during these years. Fordham was also runner-up in the Metropolitan New York Division in 1992, 1993 and 1994. In 1996, Fordham Rugby finished as champions of the Metropolitan New York Division and was among the final 16 teams representing the east in the national championship tournament and graduated three All-American players. FURFC celebrating together following a match during the 2013 season.  Academics & community service  Although it competes at the highest intercollegiate level, Fordham Rugby is officially a club sport as determined by the Fordham Athletics Department. Membership is open to any Fordham undergraduate. As such, FURFC membership reflects the diversity of Fordham. The Club's emphasis on academic achievement is evident in the high number of student-athletes who are members of the Fordham Honor's College or routinely qualify for the Dean's List. In addition to their many academic accomplishments, the Fordham University Rugby Football Club fulfills regular service commitments to the St. Baldrick's Foundation, The American Red Cross and a host of other organizations and non-profits dedicated to the betterment of the community.  Facilities  FURFC's historic home pitch is Murphy Field situated on Fordham's Historic Rose Hill campus. In addition to Murphy Field, FURFC makes occasional use of Coffey Field, Fordham's football complex.

It is effectively a sequel to the earlier 'Mugsy' by the same publisher, and has many of the same features, in both design, and setting.  Gameplay  The player takes the role of 'Mugsy', a gangster who has just been released from prison. The game begins in 1919, and the aim of the game is for Mugsy to make a fortune from the bootleg smuggling business, which has been generated as a result of prohibition. In each 'turn' of the game, which represents one year, decisions must be made about how much illegal alcohol to buy, which staff to assign to which activity, and how much money to spend on bribing law enforcement. Surviving for ten years means that the game ends, with the repeal of prohibition. The game had a similar theme and visual style to 'Mugsy', in that it featured strong, colorful graphics in a similar style to comic books, with information presented to the player in the form of dialogue between on- screen characters, such as Mugsy himself, and an un-named assistant. At each decision point, the player enters text into a dialogue box. There was also a mini-game arcade element. This is triggered in the event that one of Mugsy's rivals orders a contract killing on him. When this happens, the player controls Mugsy directly, and must shoot the assassins who are sent after him before Mugsy gets shot too many times himself. Controls Only a keyboard could be used for the majority of the gameplay, since most of the user input was by text. A joystick could be used for the arcade sequence. Release The game was released at a price of ¬£8.95 for the Commodore and Amstrad versions, and ¬£7.95 for the Spectrum.  Reception  Reviews of the Spectrum edition were generally warm, and many compared it unfavourably to the original Mugsy.

Yuen graduated from Manhattan College in 1964. A former aerospace engineer, he is also noted for his expertise in tai chi and qigong, as well as feng shui. He authored several books on the subject including Beginning Kung-Fu and Technique and Form of the Three Sectional Staff in Kung Fu (Literary links to the Orient). He is also a 2012 inductee in the Martial Arts History Museum‚Äôs Hall of Fame. In addition, World Black Belt has called him a living legend. He is also a doctor of chiropractic and now consults patients who suffer from chronic pain. His method was initially called Yuen Energetics, but it was changed to the ‚ÄúYuen Method‚Äù, co-founded with Marnie Greenberg. According to Yuen and Greenberg, the Yuen Method ‚Äúrelieves pain through feeling for the exact causes of pain‚Ä¶ [termed] weaknesses, then strengthening the deletion process for the deletion to take place, ‚Äùand the process then resets ‚Äúthe mind, body, spirit‚Äù.

The work was widely reproduced in its original form and in variations.  Biography  The Attack (Hy√∂kk√§ys), 1899 He was the youngest of nine children born to a family of farmers, to Jaakob and Kaisa Liisa Isto, and the only one who attended school; the nearest of which was six miles away. Even so, he was unable to continue beyond the elementary grades, because the nearest secondary school was too far away, in Oulu. When he turned eighteen, he went to √ñvertorne√•, in Sweden, to work at a decorating company owned by one of his cousins.Pekka R√∂nkk√∂ (1990) Eetu Isto (1865‚Äì1905) ja Hy√∂kk√§ys (1899) (Oulu: Ars Nordica) He moved to Helsinki in 1888, where he studied art and design at what is now the \\"Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture\\", but could only advance so far, due to his lack of education. Meanwhile, he supported himself by painting and decorating. Among others, he worked for the architect Karl August Wrede (1859-1943). After this experience, he was able to return to the School of Arts and complete his studies. He may have attended some classes at the Academy of Fine Arts, and began producing his first canvases. In 1895, he applied for and received a government grant that enabled him to travel to Berlin, where he studied at the Prussian Academy of the Arts. Although he was forced to support himself by house painting and decorating again, he had more time to devote to serious work, especially portraits. The Attack While studying in Berlin, in response to the Russification of Finland, he painted The Attack (Hy√∂kk√§ys) which shows the Russian eagle attacking the Finnish Maiden. He took it back to Helsinki and displayed it privately at a villa in Kaivopuisto. It may, in fact, have been completed there, as the Maiden resembles the wife of one of Isto's friends. It was reproduced and distributed by the thousands throughout Finland, Germany and Sweden, despite efforts to suppress it. After a brief return to Berlin, he settled in Alatornio in 1901 where he was a guest of the local vicar and continued to paint portraits; the best-known being that of the politician and educator Mauno Rosendal (1848-1917). In 1902, however, during a political purge, the vicar was exiled to Siberia. Three years later, Isto accompanied two of the vicar's sons on a visit there and contracted typhoid fever during the journey. He returned to Finland, but his health was fragile and he died of pneumonia shortly after his arrival. In 1936, his grave in Alatornio was decorated with a sculpture based on his famous painting.

Stolfo is an academic and professor of computer science at Columbia University, specializing in computer security. Early life Born in Brooklyn, New York, Stolfo received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from Brooklyn College in 1974. He received his Ph.D. from NYU Courant Institute in 1979 and has been on the faculty of Columbia ever since, where he's taught courses in Artificial Intelligence, Intrusion and Anomaly Detection Systems, Introduction to Programming, Fundamental Algorithms, Data Structures, and Knowledge-Based Expert Systems. Academic research While at Columbia, Stolfo has received close to $50M in funding for research that has broadly focused on Security, Intrusion Detection, Anomaly Detection, Machine Learning and includes early work in parallel computing and artificial intelligence. He has published or co-authored over 250 papers and has over 21,000 citations with an H-index of 67. In 1996 he proposed a project with DARPA that applies machine learning to behavioral patterns to detect fraud or intrusion in networks. DADO, developed by in part by Stolfo, introduced the parallel computing primitive: ‚ÄúBroadcast, Resolve, Report‚Äù, a hardwire implemented mechanism that today is called MapReduce.Strategic Computing: DARPA and the Quest for Machine Intelligence, 1983-1993, By Alex Roland, Philip Shiman, Pages 173-175. Among his earliest work, Stolfo along with colleague Greg Vesonder of Bell Labs, developed a large-scale expert data analysis system, called ACE (Automated Cable Expertise) for the nation's phone system. AT&T; Bell Labs distributed ACE to a number of telephone wire centers to improve the management and scheduling of repairs in the local loop. Stolfo coined the term FOG computing (not to be confused with fog computing) where technology is used ‚Äúto launch disinformation attacks against malicious insiders, preventing them from distinguishing the real sensitive customer data from fake worthless data.‚Äù In 2005 Stolfo received funding from the Army Research Office to conduct a workshop to bring together a group of researchers to help identify a research program to focus on insider threats. He was elevated to IEEE Fellow in 2018 \\"for his contributions to machine learning based cybersecurity.\\" He was elected as an ACM Fellow in 2019 \\"for contributions to machine-learning-based cybersecurity and parallel hardware for database inference systems\\". Career Founded in 2011, Red Balloon Security (or RBS) is a cyber security company founded by Dr Sal Stolfo and Dr Ang Cui. A spinout from the IDS lab, RBS developed a symbiote technology called FRAK as a host defense for embedded systems under the sponsorship of DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program. Created based on their IDS lab research for the DARPA Active Authentication and the Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales program, Dr Sal Stolfo and Dr. Angelos Keromytis founded Allure Security Technologies.

The first tests for using wind power on a large scale in Sweden, were conducted there in the 1970s. The area has since been developed into a wind farm. Part of the peninsula is a nature reserve for birds and grey seals.  Geography  N√§sudden is a peninsula on the south coast of Gotland, Sweden, adjacent the localities of N√§s, Fide and Burgsvik. N√§sudden had a weather station between 1986 and 1999. During this period, during a late summer heat wave of 1997 N√§sudden broke the nationwide record for consecutive overnight lows above and a yearly record for those nights. Between August 20 and September 3 the temperature never fell below , but also never rose above during the day.  Wind power  It was on N√§sudden that wind power on a large scale was first tested in Sweden. The Swedish power company Vattenfall, started to explore and develop wind power in the 1970s, and southern Gotland was selected as a suitable location for tests in 1979. Construction of a prototype wind turbine, the N√§sudden I, started in the beginning of the 1980s. The prototype was ready and started in 1983. The collecting of data from the trial runs and evaluation of the project was financed by the Swedish government. The study became the base for further research in wind power technology in Sweden. N√§sudden I was in operation until 1989, when it was replaced by N√§sudden II. N√§sudden was developed into a large wind farm during the 1990s. In 2010, it had the highest wind power density in Sweden. In 2014, there were 60 wind turbines on N√§sudden, ten of which were owned by Vattenfall. In 2004, the then-largest land based wind turbine, the Olsvenne 2, was built on the peninsula. On 9January 2007, the N√§sudden II was decommissioned. During the time it was in operation it produced 61,4 GWh in 61,496 hours, a world record at that time. On N√§sudden, there is also a mast with instruments for measuring temperature, wind direction, wind speed and other meteorological data on different altitudes. The readings are continuously presented on line, where it is available to anyone. In 2009, there were a total of 156 wind turbines on Gotland, producing 200,158,000 kWh of electricity. In 2014, the last of the first large wind turbines were torn down and dismantled. They will be replaced by a new generation of more efficient turbines. Prior to that, a new cable for transmitting the electricity to mainland Sweden must be in place, since the existing one is insufficient for the energy produced by the new turbines. The N√§sudden wind farm is open to the public and has an exhibition about wind power.  Nature reserve  On the southwestern tip of N√§sudden is the N√§s Reef Seal and Bird Reserve (N√§srevets s√§l- och f√•gelskyddsomr√•de). The area has a rich bird life, it is the second most visited habitat for greylag geese in the Baltic Sea during their annual \\"wing moult\\". It also has a small colony of grey seals.

The manuscript combines Part 1 and Part 2 of Henry IV into a single-play redaction. Scholarly consensus indicates that the manuscript was revised in the early 17th century by Sir Edward Dering, a man known for his interest in literature and theater. Dering prepared his redaction for an amateur performance starring friends and family at Surrenden Manor in Pluckley, Kent, where the manuscript was discovered in 1844. This is the earliest known instance of an amateur production of Shakespeare in England.Dobson 2007, p. 34 Sourced from the 1613 fifth quarto of Part 1 and the 1600 first quarto of Part 2, the Dering Manuscript contains many textual differences from published quarto and folio editions of the plays. Dering cut nearly 3000 lines of Shakespearian text (including significant abridgment of the character of Falstaff) and added some 50 lines of his own invention along with numerous minor interventions.Williams and Evans 1974, p. xi The Dering Manuscript is currently a part of the collection at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC (Folger MS V.b.34). Description Bibliography The Dering Manuscript is a small folio (11.75 in x 7.75 in) of 55 extant leaves, composed of two large quires with six cancel leaves interposed in between. The six cancels come from different stock paper than the main quires. They are wider, cut more irregularly and slightly shorter at the spine than the main quires. Such differences suggest that these six leaves were inserted after the completion of the two main quires.Yeandle 1986, p. 225 The first and second quires correspond to Part 1 and Part 2 of Henry IV respectively, and the six cancel leaves in between contain transitional scenes that Dering reworked after the manuscript's initial preparation.Yeandle 1986, p. 226 Two hands contributed to the composition of the Dering Manuscript, known as Hand I and Hand II. Hand I wrote page one of the manuscript and attached an eight line addition to the first scene on a piece of scrap paper. Hand II completed the remainder of the text. The manuscript also displays numerous modifications and corrections of Hand II's work by Hand I. Stylistic differences between the two show that Hand I was an unprofessional hand, but Hand II belonged to a professional scribe.Hemingway 1936, p. 495 Hand I has been identified as that of Edward Dering, who began to compile a redacted version based on the quarto editions he owned before contracting the work out to a professional scribe.Evans 1955, p. 500 Hand II, therefore, belongs to the scribe, a man named Samuel Carington, who appears in Dering's \\"Booke of Expenses\\" in early 1623 for \\"writing oute the play of Henry the fourth\\".Yeandle 1986, p. 224 After outsourcing the transcription to Carington, Dering went through the text again and re-revised.Evans 1955, p. 501 Text Dering's source text for sections of the manuscript based on Part 1 was the fifth quarto of The History of Henry IV, printed in 1613. Scholars point to the manuscript's fidelity to the punctuation of the fifth quarto and to two textual errors unique to that printing as evidence (Dering MS 3.3.80, Globe III.iii.100; Dering MS 4.2.76, Globe V.ii.76).Williams and Evans 1974, p. viii. The scenes from Part 2 are derived from the second issue of the first quarto, printed in 1600. This reasoning is substantiated by the presence of the King's soliloquy on sleep (III.i), which appears only in the second issue of the first quarto. Additionally, numerous small errors hold consistent across the two texts.Williams and Evans 1974, p. viii. Although the manuscript spans both Henry IV Part 1 and Henry IV Part 2, the majority of Dering's version comes from Part I. Whereas only 347 out of some 2968 lines in Part 1 are missing (approximately 11%), Dering cut 2374 lines of the 3180 in Part 2 (approximately 75%).Williams and Evans 1974, p. ix. Major omissions from Part 1 include scenes II.i and VI.vi as well as several other major abridgments of longer scenes. For the purposes of his amateur performance, Dering tried to decrease the size of his cast. His cuts eliminate several characters, including two Carriers, Ostler, Gadshill, Chamberlain, the Archbishop, Sir Michael, musicians, and Westmoreland. Only four scenes remain of Part 2: Northumberland hearing of Hotspur's death, the death of the king, Hal's rebuke of Falstaff, and a comic scene between Falstaff and Mistress Quickly.Holland 2007, p. 29. Peter Holland notes that Dering's playtext \\"places its emphasis on Part I and turns to Part 2 only as needed to end its action\\".Holland 2007, 29. Despite the popularity of the character Falstaff with contemporary audiences, Dering subjects him to significant abbreviation. The cuts redirect emphasis from the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal and the latter's maturation to the political moments of Shakespeare's text.Holland 2007, 28. According to Michael Dobson in an essay on the history of amateur performance, \\"the performances Dering and his friends gave in the hall at Surrenden must have resembled a semi-public debate about the rival claims of aggrieved peers and a dubiously legitimate monarchy\\".Dobson 2007, p. 34. Portrait of Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet by William Dobson History and provenance The Dering MS was discovered in 1844 by the Reverend Lambert B. Larkin while he researched the history of Kent in the collection of Sir Edward Dering, the 8th Baronet of Surrenden Hall, Kent.Halliwell 1845, p. x The manuscript had been stored for nearly two centuries at Surrenden Hall in a library of charters, books and manuscripts compiled by the first Sir Edward Dering (1598-1644), a man famously enthusiastic for literature, drama and book collecting (Dering boasts the earliest recorded purchase of a First Folio, in December 1623). Larkin immediately alerted the Shakespeare Society, which in 1845 published a transcription of the manuscript with an introduction by James Halliwell-Phillipps (named James Halliwell at the time of publication). Halliwell-Phillipps purchased the manuscript shortly afterwards, and in the 1860s conferred it to the collection of George Greville, 4th Earl of Warwick in the 1860s. Following the Earl's death in 1893, Henry Clay Folger purchased the manuscript in 1897. The manuscript now resides in the Folger Shakespeare Library (V.b.34) in Washington, DC. Dating In his introduction to the original transcription of the manuscript, Halliwell-Phillips notes that the since the corrections to the manuscript were written by a hand proven to be Dering's (based on letter samples), the manuscript must date to before 1644, the year of Dering's death.Halliwell 1845, p. xii More recent scholarship has pinned the date of the redaction between 1622 and 1624. A piece of scrap paper which Dering attached to the first page of the manuscript displays the cast list from another amateur performance by Dering at Surrenden Park of The Spanish Curate, a contemporary comedy by John Fletcher. The play was licensed in the Stationers%27 Register on October 24 of 1622. Dering therefore prepared the redaction after October, 1622, but before the summer of 1624, when one of the actors listed in the cast, Francis Manouch, left Kent. Hemingway, 1936, p. 496-497 Since Dering's ‚ÄúBooke of expenses‚Äù lists the date of Samuel Carington's payment as February 27, 1623, Laetitia Yeandle asserts that Dering prepared the original redaction shortly before contracting the transcription to Carington, and then made another set of revisions to Carington's work shortly after its acquisition.Yeandle 1986, p. 226 Notes References *Dobson, Michael. \\"Sowing the Dragon‚Äôs Teeth: Amateurism, Domesticity, and the Anglophone Audience for Shakespeare, 1607-2007.\\" Shakespeare Worldwide and the Idea of an Audience 15 (2007). *Evans, G.

Born in Ahmedabad, he later moved to Becharaji in devotion to goddess Bahuchar Mata. He wrote several Garba and other devotional songs. Life Not much is known about his life but his works and folklore are source of information regarding his life. Vallabh was born in Bhatt Mevada Brahmin caste. He was born in Navapura Para of Ahmedabad on Aaso Sud 8 of Vikram Samvat 1696 or 1700 AD. He moved from Ahmedabad to Chunval (now Becharaji). The brothers went under Yagnopavit ritual at age of five and were taught by Paramanand Swarup Brahmachari for brief period. He was Vaishnav in his early life but became follower of Shakti later. He had three brothers; Heri, Dhola and name of third is not known. Hari and Dhola Bhatt were also poets. He wrote his first Garbo, Anandno Garbo on Falgun Sud 3 of Samvat 1709 as described in the Garba, at the age of 13. He wrote several Garba dedicated to Bahuchar Mata which are still popular across Gujarat. His name along with his brothers are perpetuated in cry of devotees in temple, Vallabh-Dhola Ki Jai or Vallabh-Hari Ki Jai. He died on Aaso Sud 8 of Samvat 1807. Legend In Narmagadya, there is a legend associated with Vallabh Bhatt. It is said that once he visited Nathdwara to worship Shrinathji. He accidentally spit in temple premises and was scolded by people. He responded that parents don't scold children for spitting in their laps. The priests told that mother may not scold children but fathers may scold. Thus Vallabh changed his devotion from male figure Shrinathji to female figure Shakti or Bahuchar Mata thereafter. Works Vallabh wrote the first Laavni, a poetry in specific taala, dedicated goddess. He wrote several Garba, Dhal, Pada, aarti songs mostly dedicated to goddess Bahuchar while others are dedicated to religious and epic figures. Some of them are Anandno Garbo, Krishnavirahna Pada, Chosaath Joganiono Garbo, Bahucharajina Pada, Ramchandrajina Pada, Aarasurno Garbo, Shangarno Garbo, Mahakalino Garbo, Kalikaalno Garbo, Satyabhamano Garbo, Aankhmichamanino Garbo, Kamlakanthna Baar Mahina, Vrajviyog, Kajodano Garbo, Dhanushdharinu Varnan, Ambajina Mahina, Bahucharajini Aarti, Bahucharajini Gagar, Bahucharajino Rang Padasangrah, Rang Aarti, Chhutak Pada, Shrichakrano Garbo, Ambajino Garbo, Ramvivah, Abhimanyuno Chakravo. In Kalikaalno Garbo, he portrayed misery and immorality during famine of Samvat 1788.

The term was first recorded in 1642. The bandwin was characteristically made up of two teams of two women and a man who acted as reapers and a bandster who gathered and bound the sheaves. The work of women in the bandwin was unusually almost as valued as that of the men. Use The organisation of reapers in a bandwin from The Farmer's Guide to Scientific and Practical Agriculture (1851) The term was first recorded in 1642 in the Sheriffs records for Aberdeenshire.A. Fenton, The Shape of the Past 1: Essays in Scottish Ethnology, Volume 1 (John Donald, 1985, rpt 2008), , p. 115. It may be derived from the bands of stalks used to tie the sheaves of grain,A. Fenton and M. A. Mackay, eds, An Introduction to Scottish Ethnology: A Compendium of Scottish Ethnology Volume 1 (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2013), . or because it made up a band or group.J. Jamieson, Supplement to The Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language: Illustrating the Words in Their Different Significations, by Examples from Ancient and Modern Writers, Shewing Their Affinity to Those of Other Languages (W. & C. Tait, 1825), p. 51. Organisation Most members were women from the Highlands. Characteristically they were made up of seven members: six shearers using the crescent-shaped sickle, and a bandster who bound the sheaves.R. Powell, Scottish Agricultural Implements (Botley: Osprey, 1988), , p. 21. The reapers were divided into two teams, each of which worked two ridges of a runrig. The bandster was usually a man and the two teams were ideally made up of two women and one man.H. Stephens and J.

A bandster could bind the corn of two teams and the six reapers could cut two acres a day. Wages The work of women in the bandwin was unusually almost as valued as that of the men.

The seat of the German Confederation, Frankfurt am Main, sat upon this line. Geography Eventually the Main line became the southern boundary of the North German Confederation. As such, the Main line did not follow the Main river exactly; rather, the line went east to west: first, along the northern border of the Kingdom of Bavaria; then, along the river Main to Mainz; and finally, along the Western border of the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Bavarian Palatinate towards the French border. The line split Hesse at Frankfurt am Main; however, the entirety of Frankfurt am Main belonged to the North German Confederation.

Biographical He was born on October 2, 1951. He completed his schooling at Athens College in 1970. He studied philosophy and classical philology at the Yale University in the United States, gaining a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) cum laude. From 1974-1975 he attended classes in philosophy at the Paris- Sorbonne University under Ferdinand Alqui√© and Yvon Belaval. After 1975 he turned to Byzantine studies and in 1981 he received a Doctorate at the University of London having prepared his thesis under the guidance of the British Byzantinist, Robert Browning (Byzantinist), on Nicholas of Methone's Refutation of the Elements of Theology, a 12th-century philosophical and theological work by the Neoplatonist philosopher, Proclus. For the next eight years of his time in England he taught Byzantine Literature and Greek Palaeography at Birkbeck, King's and Royal Holloway Colleges as well as at the Institute of Classical Studies, University of London. In 1985 he founded with Julian Chrysostomides and Joseph A. Munitiz the Byzantine Literature Seminar at the Warburg Institute of London University which brought together the interests of many students and researchers. In 1987 on the initiative of Jonathan Riley-Smith, Julian Chrysostomides and Athanasios Angelou the joint diploma / MA programme in Byzantine Studies was established at Royal Holloway College. In 1989 he returned to Greece to take up his post as Assistant Professor of Byzantine Literature at the University of Ioannina. From 1995 he has been Associate Professor at the same university. He undertook administrative duties as Chairman of the Department of Philology from 2005-2009 and as Dean of the School of Philosophy from 2008-2013. Research activities His research interests focus upon Byzantine rhetoric and the history of Late Byzantine literature. In particular he has been engaged with the Histories of Niketas Choniates and John Kantakouzenos, examining questions which relate to the structure and organisation of the works. Especially, among other things, he has occupied himself with the personality and thought of Gennadios Scholarios, giving emphasis to the use in his work of the word \\"Hellene, as well as to the position which the event of the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 took in his thought. Cultural activities He has also developed extensive activities in the artistic field. Through a series of presentations combining music, words and images, he aimed to project Byzantium not only as geographical space but also as a synthesis of musical and literary phenomena in the tradition of the Greek East. He has collaborated with the musical ensemble En Chordais of Thessaloniki and Kyriakos Kalaitzides, the actors Dimitri Kataleipho, Lydia Koniordou, Karyofyllia Karampeti, Moni Ovadia, Alan Bates, the singers Melihat G√ºlses from Turkey, the Lebanese Ghada Shbeir and musicians from Turkey, Lebanon, Italy and England with performances in London, Brussels, Venice (Saint Mark's Basilica), Athens and Plovdiv. The concert of religious music organised with the English musician, Guy Prothero, in St Paul's Cathedral was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales, and reported in the leading article of The Times newspaper.

They are now headquartered in Lubbock, Texas. In 2015, the Texas state senate passed a congratulatory resolution, authored by Charles Perry, recognizing the group as Native Americans. The organization is a state-recognized tribe. Origins Yaqui were wanted for killing Mexican soldiers in around 1850 and were ultimately chased out of Sonora, Mexico, in 1870. Yaquis had been executed by Mexican firing squads, forcibly deported or enslaved. Generations later, younger family descendants of Chief Lino, representing ten families, gathered to form the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians forming the very first Texas Yaqui Tribal Council reuniting other Texas Yaquis families (Lujan, Arrietta, Valenzuela, Buitemea, Delarosa/Cuevas, Urquides, Gomez, Flores, Ochoa, Carrasco, Galindo, Galvan) who scattered throughout Texas and New Mexico bringing in original Yaqui families.History The Texas Band of Yaquis formed its very first open enrollment for other Yaqui families in the U.S. in need of Native rights who preserved their Yaqui identity. Using online genealogical database records, all Texas Band members have proof of Yaqui Indian ancestry on file dating back to 1700 Sonoran Yaqui Territories. Mountain Yaquis Yaqui Indians in Lubbock, Texas. Texas Yaqui Indian children Sierra Yaquis or Mountain Yaquis were different from very well known pueblo or village Yaquis. Mountain Yaquis protected the outer regions of the Hiakim or the Yaqui homelands.Stories They were fierce fighters and warriors who fought against the Mexicans and Americans who came into Yaqui boundary lands in Sonora. Like Comanches and Apaches, they were known to raid villages and farms, taking women, children, livestock and supplies. Nomadic, they would travel in groups from the southwest to northern regions of the US long before Mexico or the US were established. Weaponry of the Sierra Yaquis was bows and arrows. Spears were often laced with dried poisons from various venomous species. Later after foreign encroachments they changed and adopted firearms. They then in time began to dress like Mexican farmers to not be identified as fighters. Evidence of Mountain Yaquis near Texas was photographed by war photographer Otis Aultman in his collections at the State of Texas Historical Archives Mountain Yaqui Fighters Mountain Yaqui fighters prayed to patron saints for protection, especially Our Lady of Guadalupe, for protection from bullets or harm from their enemies. In tribal history, it is said the Mountain Yaquis disappeared after the wars and deportations of the Yaquis and merged with other cultures. The Texas Band of Yaquis held on to their Mountain Yaqui tribal culture and continue to do so within families. There are now over 900 documented tribal members in the states of Texas, Arizona, California and New Mexico. Texas Band Yaquis Texas Yaquis are not easily compared to Arizona Yaquis, who are federally recognized and the Pascua Yaqui Tribe, and are different in the sense that the Texas Band Yaquis descend from Mountain Yaqui Military Fighters and not Pueblo Village Yaquis. Texas Band Yaquis were the \\"warlike\\" Yaquis like many other Bands that robbed trains and villages. Many disappeared and vanished among other cultures except the Texas Band who remained hidden within families forbidden to speak to outsiders they were Hiaki. Devoted to Our Lady of Guadalupe they are known as the fiercest fighters and the most feared Warriors, the Texas Band descend from the names, Cobajori, Bacasegua, Valenzuela, Bacomea, Usacamea and Tonopomea. After the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ending the wars in Mexico, The U.S. still had to deal with raiding Indians in Mexico along the U.S. Mexican border of Texas. The Federal Government set aside land for a Texas Indian Reservation specifically for Apaches and Yaquis along with other \\"unidentified\\" Indians. The Reservation was never established due to the lack of Indian agents to oversee the Reservation and Chief Lino did not want himself and his band to go to the Reservation to be executed or abused by authorities. Original Texas Band Families observe Standard Catholic observances such as Easter, Saints days, and many others. These observances are usually celebrated by the Texas Band Coyote Dances held at night, inherited from their Military Yaqui descendants and hold homage and devotion to \\"Our Lady of Guadalupe\\". The Texas Band of Yaquis are now based in Lubbock, Texas with support from the Pueblos of Vicam, Vicam Switch, and Loma de Guamuchil Cocorit in Sonora. Recognition Resolution SR989 Founders of the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians began a long process of genealogical research to obtain proof of their Yaqui Indian ancestry. The Texas Band obtained original documents tracing back to the Yaqui Territory of 1700. In 2013, all records and documentation of Yaqui ancestry were submitted to the State of Texas and, on 27 May 2015, the Texas Band of Yaqui Indians was received a congratulatory resolution passed by the Texas State Senate and authored by Charles Perry.

The main objective of the games is to rebuild a run-down old farm and turn it into a successful one. The most recent game was Harvest Moon: Light of Hope, released for Microsoft Windows in 2017. Previously, Natsume published the series Bokuj≈ç Monogatari in North America under the title Harvest Moon. However, the developer, original publisher and owner of this series, Marvelous, decided to have their own American division, Xseed Games, take over North American distribution in 2014. However, due to Natsume keeping the rights to the Harvest Moon name, the latest titles in the series were rebranded Story of Seasons while Natsume began to produce their own series under the Harvest Moon name. Origins The name \\"Harvest Moon\\" was originally used for the series created by Marvelous known in Japan as . Natsume initially distributed this series under the name Harvest Moon outside of Japan until 2014. At that time, Natsume maintained the rights to the Harvest Moon series name after Marvelous announced that it would have its subsidiary, Xseed Games, take over North American distribution. Because of this, Xseed began localizing the series to North America under the Story of Seasons title, beginning with the release of the game of the same name. In 2007, Natsume has taken the opportunity to develop their own video game series using the name Harvest Moon in North America and Europe, and in 2014, it released Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley, the first farm simulator game in the new series. The resulting spin-off series, at least since Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley, has caused some degree of confusion among fans and video game news sources, due to the game not actually being a part of the same series as the games titled Harvest Moon before it.
